Coping with long cold winters and hot summers requires specific physiological and behavioural adaptations. Endemic amphipods of Lake Baikal, Eulimnogammarus verrucosus and Eulimnogammarus cyaneus, show high metabolic activity throughout the year; E. verrucosus even reproduces in winter. In contrast, the widespread Holarctic amphipod Gammarus lacustris overwinters in torpor. This study investigated the transcriptomic hallmarks of E. verrucosus, E. cyaneus and G. lacustris exposed to low water temperatures. Amphipods were exposed to 1.5 degrees C and 12 degrees C (corresponding to the mean winter and summer water temperatures, respectively, in the Baikal littoral) for one month. At 1.5 degrees C, G. lacustris showed upregulation of ribosome biogenesis and mRNA processing genes, as well as downregulation of genes related to growth, reproduction and locomotor activity, indicating enhanced energy allocation to somatic maintenance. Our results suggest that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway is involved in the preparation for hibernation; downregulation of the actin cytoskeleton pathway genes could relate to the observed low locomotor activity of G. lacustris at 1.5 degrees C. The differences between the transcriptomes of E. verrucosus and E. cyaneus from the 1.5 degrees C and 12 degrees C exposures were considerably smaller than for G. lacustris. In E. verrucosus, cold-exposure triggered reproductive activity was indicated by upregulation of respective genes, whereas in E. cyaneus, genes related to mitochondria functioning were upregulated, indicating cold compensation in this species. Our data elucidate the molecular characteristics behind the different adaptations of amphipod species from the Lake Baikal area to winter conditions.

Species invasions shift microbial phenology in a two-decade freshwater time series	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Invasive species impart abrupt changes on ecosystems, but their impacts on microbial communities are often overlooked. We paired a 20 y freshwater microbial community time series with zooplankton and phytoplankton counts, rich environmental data, and a 6 y cyanotoxin time series. We observed strong microbial phenological patterns that were disrupted by the invasions of spiny water flea (Bythotrephes cederstromii) and zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha). First, we detected shifts in Cyanobacteria phenology. After the spiny water flea invasion, Cyanobacteria dominance crept earlier into clearwa-ter; and after the zebra mussel invasion, Cyanobacteria abundance crept even earlier into the diatom-dominated spring. During summer, the spiny water flea invasion sparked a cascade of shifting diversity where zooplankton diversity decreased and Cyanobacteria diversity increased. Second, we detected shifts in cyanotoxin phenology. After the zebra mussel invasion, microcystin increased in early summer and the duration of toxin pro-duction increased by over a month. Third, we observed shifts in heterotrophic bacteria phenology. The Bacteroidota phylum and members of the acI Nanopelagicales lineage were differentially more abundant. The proportion of the bacterial community that changed differed by season; spring and clearwater communities changed most fol-lowing the spiny water flea invasion that lessened clearwater intensity, while summer communities changed least following the zebra mussel invasion despite the shifts in Cyanobacteria diversity and toxicity. A modeling framework identified the invasions as primary drivers of the observed phenological changes. These long-term invasion-me-diated shifts in microbial phenology demonstrate the interconnectedness of microbes with the broader food web and their susceptibility to long-term environmental change.					; McMahon, Katherine/I-3651-2012	Rohwer, Robin/0000-0002-2664-6489; Hale, Riley/0000-0001-6367-0990; 													0027-8424	1091-6490				MAR 14	2023	120	11							e2211796120	10.1073/pnas.2211796120	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2211796120								36881623					WOS:001230310200002

To estimate mortality, we attached external ultrasonic transmitters to 59 striped bass (mean total length [TL] = 585 mm). Striped bass were caught with angling gear, tagged, and immediately released or held in live-release tubes for 2, 4, or 6 h prior to release. No mortality of striped bass was observed during spring. Overall mortality during summer was 83%. Mortality of summer-caught striped bass was not related to tube residence time, fish TL, depth of capture, or Surface water temperature. To characterize physiological stress, we measured the plasma cortisol, glucose, lactate, and osmolality levels of 62 additional striped bass (mean TL = 563 mm) that were angled and immediately released or angled and held in live-release tubes. Plasma cortisol, glucose, lactate, and osmolality were positively related to tube residence time. When the hematological characteristics were considered only in relation to tube residence time, responses indicative of physiological stress continued for about 150 min, after which blood chemistry began to return to normal. Live-release tubes appear to be useful for keeping striped bass alive when they are angled from cool water, but they are not effective for striped bass angled from warm water. The high summer mortality of striped bass suggests a need for restrictive fishing regulations during the summer for the Lake Murray striped bass fishery.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				NOV	2005	25	4					1273	1280		10.1577/M04-156.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M04-156.1													WOS:000234015800008

Detailed information about the long term variability of aquatic plants can help investigate the potential driving mechanisms and help mitigate the degradation. In this paper, based on Google Earth Engine cloud-computing platform, we made use of a 33-year (1987-2019) retrospective archive of moderate resolution Landsat TM, ETM + and OLI satellite images to estimate the extent changes in aquatic vegetation in Longgan Lake from Middle Yangtze River Basin in China using the modified enhanced vegetation index, including emerged, floating-leaved and floating macrophytes. The analysis of the long term dynamics of aquatic vegetation showed that aquatic vegetation were mainly distributed in the western part of the lake, where lake bottom elevation ranged from 11 to 12 m, with average water depth of less than 1 m in spring. The vegetation area variation for the 33-year period were divided into six stages. In years with heavy precipitation, the vegetation area decreased sharply. In the following years, the area normally restored. Aquatic vegetation area had a significant negative correlation with the spring water level and summer water level. The results showed that aquatic vegetation was negatively affected when water depth exceeded 2.5 m in May and 5 m in summer. It is recommended that water depth remain close to 1 m in spring and close to 3 m in summer for aquatic vegetation growth. Our study provide quantitative evidence that water-level fluctuations drive vegetation changes in Longgan Lake, and present a basis for sustainable lake restoration and management.					; Yu, Gongliang/HLV-9898-2023; wenxia, tan/GRO-6354-2022	Tan, Wenxia/0000-0002-7804-0294; yang, shao/0000-0002-2593-0197; 														2073-4441				AUG	2020	12	8							2178	10.3390/w12082178	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12082178													WOS:000564747300001

Habitat use and preference of adult pike (Esox lucius L.) in an anthropogenically impacted lowland river	LIMNOLOGICA					10th International Symposium on Ecohydraulics	2014	Trondheim, NORWAY					To efficiently manage northern pike (Esox Lucius), information is needed on its habitat use and preference. However, knowledge gaps still exist, especially on pike habitat use and preference in rivers characterised by artificial environments. We investigated the use of the main river, tributaries and side arms at the macro-scale, and the use and preference of riparian habitats by adult pike at the meso-scale in an anthropogenically impacted river basin. Adult pike were followed in winter and spring by radio telemetry. At the macro-scale pike intensively used the main river in winter and spring, but also frequented specific side arms in winter and specific tributaries in spring, which may indicate the importance of these habitats to adult pike. At the meso-scale, reedy semi-natural banks were used the most, irrespective of any assumption on habitat availability or use. The findings underline the value of protecting the least impacted, (semi)natural habitats for adult pike in an anthropogenically impacted river system. The large behavioural differences in habitat use between individuals at both habitat scales further underline the importance of habitat heterogeneity. The results also provide insight into the impact of riparian habitat restoration on adult pike and may be used to more efficiently manage pike rivers, e.g. by enhancing the lateral connectivity with river side arms or by reconstructing natural riparian habitats.

A.			Evidence for the diet and habitat of two late Pleistocene mastodons from the Midwest, USA	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												We analyzed intestinal contents of two late-glacial mastodons preserved in lake sediments in Ohio (Burning Tree mastodon) and Michigan (Heisler mastodon). A multi-proxy suite of macrofossils and microfossils provided unique insights into what these individuals had eaten just before they died and added significantly to knowledge of mastodon diets. We reconstructed the mastodons' habitats with similar multi-proxy analyses of the embedding lake sediments. Non-pollen palynomorphs, especially spores of coprophilous fungi differentiated intestinal and environmental samples. The Burning Tree mastodon gut sample originates from the small intestine. The Heisler mastodon sample is part of the large intestine to which humans had added clastic material to anchor parts of the carcass under water to cache the meat. Both carcasses had been dismembered, suggesting that the mastodons had been hunted or scavenged, in line with other contemporaneous mastodon finds and the timing of early human incursion into the Midwest. Both mastodons lived in mixed coniferous-deciduous late-glacial forests. They browsed tree leaves and twigs, especially Picea. They also ate sedge-swamp plants and drank the lake water. Our multi-proxy estimates for a spring/summer season of death contrast with autumn estimates derived from prior tusk analyses. We document the recovered fossil remains with photographs.

In the present study, we use two non-destructive and high-resolution systems (computed tomography, X-ray fluorescence) to address all sedimentological facies and structural characteristics on a 6 m long, partly laminated sediment record, from Vouliagmeni lake, located at the eastern part of the Corinth Gulf, Greece. Vouliagmeni lake is the deepest coastal lake in Greece, and its location is of great importance since it is located in one of the most tectonically active regions in the world. The chronological framework of the retrieved sediment sequence spans the last 12,000 years, with alternations of laminated and non-laminated sections. The annual accumulation of the laminated sequences was determined through the radionuclide concentration of 14 samples. Scanning tomography was performed with a medical CT scanner and a mu CT scanner, aiming to compare the potentials and variations of both methods. Lamination boundaries, event layers (turbidites) and sediment deformations were distinguished through processing the extracted 3D rendered volumes, after applying ranges depending on Hounsfield (HU) values. Microscopic analysis revealed three main layer types in the varve sequences that were examined, attributing to summer/spring, autumn and winter deposits. Statistical analysis of the elemental composition, magnetic susceptibility (MS) measurements and HU values revealed three clusters/facies, reflecting climatic and in-lake hydrological changes. Cluster A emulates sedimentation during arid conditions, while Cluster B reflects humid conditions with increased precipitation and erosion. Cluster C represents sequences with homogenous Ca-rich sediment. Our proposed workflow highlights the possible correlation between the non-destructive variables that were measured, but also the variations and applications of each method and software used during this study.

Ruby; Tan, Zeli			Intercomparison of Thermal Regime Algorithms in 1-D Lake Models	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Lakes are an important component of the global weather and climate system, but the modeling of their thermal regimes has shown large uncertainties due to the highly diverse lake properties and model configurations. Here, we evaluate the algorithms of four key lake thermal processes including turbulent heat fluxes, wind-driven mixing, light extinction, and snow density, using a highly diverse lake data set provided by the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) 2a lake sector. Algorithm codes are configured and run separately within the same parent model to rule out any interference from factors apart from the algorithms examined. Evaluations are based on both simulation accuracy and recalibration complexity for application to global lakes. For turbulent heat fluxes, the non-Monin-Obukhov similarity (MOS) based, more simplified algorithms perform better in predicting lake epilimnion temperatures and achieve high convergence in the values of the calibrated parameters. For wind-driven mixing, a two-algorithm strategy considering lake shape and season is suggested with the regular mixing algorithm used for spring and earlier summer and the mixing-enhanced algorithm for summer steady stratification and fall overturn periods. There are no evident differences in the simulated thermocline depths using different light extinction algorithms or the observation. Finally, for lake ice phenology, an optimal algorithm is decided for most northern lakes while the Arctic lakes require separate consideration. Our study provides highly practical guides for improving 1-D lake models and feasible parameterization strategies to better simulate global lake thermal regimes.					; Tan, Zeli/G-7792-2018; Leung, L./F-9276-2018; Leung, Ruby/F-9276-2018; Guo, Mingyang/AAV-8580-2020	Golub, Malgorzata/0000-0001-9361-0331; Guo, Mingyang/0000-0002-3087-453X; Yao, Huaxia/0000-0001-5875-7215; Tan, Zeli/0000-0001-5958-2584; Leung, Ruby/0000-0002-3221-9467; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				JUN	2021	57	6							e2020WR028776	10.1029/2020WR028776	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020WR028776													WOS:000667245100013

Scott			Striped Bass Habitat Selection Rules in Reservoirs without Suitable Summer Habitat Offer Insight into Consequences for Growth	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The traditional view of habitat requirements for inland striped bass Morone saxatilis suggests that these fish need dissolved oxygen (DO) levels above 2-3 mg/L and temperatures below 25 degrees C to thrive. However, striped bass are found in reservoirs where hypolimnetic hypoxia forces them into warm temperatures (27-30 degrees C) for much of the summer, and contrary to expectations, these populations do not consistently experience poor growth or mortality. We used telemetry of adult striped bass in Badin Lake, North Carolina, to characterize habitat selection by striped bass in systems with unsuitable summer habitat. As summer stratification developed, striped bass selected preferred temperatures of 20-23 degrees C as long as the DO was at least 2 mg/L. Once hypoxia forced striped bass into warmer water, the fish concentrated at the top of the oxycline (defined as the depth just above the largest decline in DO occurring over a 1-m change in depth), which was 1-2 degrees C warmer but had greater DO levels (4-8 mg/L) than the coolest water, with DO of 2 mg/L. Striped bass remained at the top of the oxycline into the fall, even after deeper water with preferred temperatures and a DO level of 2 mg/L became available. We suggest that these patterns, supported by observations in the literature, represent summer habitat selection rules for striped bass in reservoirs where all oxygenated habitat exceeds temperatures traditionally considered suitable for striped bass. We also show that the depth distribution of Badin Lake striped bass in response to physical habitat constraints causes them to overlap spatially with warmwater prey inhabiting shallow, warmwater depths both in the summer and early fall. Badin Lake striped bass continue to feed and grow over the summer, providing evidence that the availability of adequate prey resources can offset the costs of poor summer habitat. Warm, productive reservoirs without permanent thermal refuges may therefore provide better habitat for maintaining quality growth and condition than those systems where occupation of cooler temperatures segregates striped bass from their prey.					; Thompson, Jessica/GXW-0323-2022	Thompson, Jessica/0000-0002-3258-4958; 													0002-8487					SEP	2010	139	5					1450	1464		10.1577/T09-140.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T09-140.1													WOS:000282594000016

The birth rate was correlated to the temperature during the period of reproduction from March-Dec., but a stronger correlation was found between the parameters from March-May. During July and Aug. the birth rate was negatively correlated to the transparency when a delay of about 1 wk was taken into account. In the spring the birth rate was limited by the temperature. In mid-summer food limited the production of eggs; in late summer improved food conditions caused a second maximum of reproduction. The sampling intervals did not essentially exceed the generation time of K. cochlearis. Hatching of resting eggs in the spring was demonstrated.																			0003-9136						1979	87	2					152	165																WOS:A1979HV45600003

The processes contributing to the unique influence of lakes on permafrost are (in order of decreasing importance): the ratio between winter (snow + surface ice freezing/conduction + free convection) and summer (forced convection) heat transfer coefficients, storage of accumulated summer heat beneath lake snow cover, and asymmetry of lake-ice freezing and thawing geometries.

This variability can complicate the interpretation of monitoring data designed to assess year-to-year changes. It is suggested that relatively simple dynamic multimedia mass balance models can assist interpretation by out variability attributable to temperature and other seasonal effects as well as identifying likely contaminant sources. To illustrate this approach, high-volume air samples were collected from January to June. 2002 at a rural location in southern Ontario. Gas-phase concentrations for both SigmaPBDE and SigmaPCB rose from below the detection limit during the winter to 19 and 110 pg m(-3), respectively, in early spring, only to decrease again following bud-burst. Passive air samples (PAS), deployed at seven urban, rural and remote sites for two one-month periods prior and following bud-burst, indicate a strong urban-rural gradient for both the PBDEs and PCBs. Calculated air concentrations from the PAS are shown to agree favorably with the high-volume air sampling data. with concentrations ranging 6-85 pg m(-3) and 6-360 pg m(-3) for SigmaPBDE and SigmaPCB, respectively. Concentrations in urban areas are typically 5 times greater than in rural locations. These data were interpreted using simulation results from a fate model including a seasonally variable forest canopy and snow pack, suggesting that the primary source is urban and that the "spring pulse" is the result of several interacting factors. Such contaminants are believed to be efficiently deposited in winter. accumulate in the snow pack and are released to terrestrial surfaces upon snow melt in spring. Warmer temperatures cause volatilization and a rise in air concentrations until uptake in emerging foliage leads to a decline in late spring. Implications for monitoring are discussed.

Seasonal variations in pore water and sediment geochemistry of littoral lake sediments (Asylum Lake, MI, USA)	GEOCHEMICAL TRANSACTIONS												Background: Seasonal changes in pore water and sediment redox geochemistry have been observed in many near-surface sediments. Such changes have the potential to strongly influence trace metal distribution and thus create seasonal fluctuations in metal mobility and bioavailability. Results: Seasonal trends in pore water and sediment geochemistry are assessed in the upper 50 cm of littoral kettle lake sediments. Pore waters are always redox stratified, with the least compressed redox stratification observed during fall and the most compressed redox stratification observed during summer. A 2-step sequential sediment extraction yields much more Fe in the first step, targeted at amorphous Fe(III) (hydr) oxides (AEF), then in the second step, which targets Fe(II) monosulfides. Fe extracted in the second step is relatively invariant with depth or season. In contrast, AEF decreases with sediment depth, and is seasonally variable, in agreement with changes in redox stratification inferred from pore water profiles. A 5-step Tessier extraction scheme was used to assess metal association with operationally-defined exchangeable, carbonate, iron and manganese oxide (FMO), organic/sulfide and microwave-digestible residual fractions in cores collected during winter and spring. Distribution of metals in these two seasons is similar. Co, As, Cd, and U concentrations approach detection limits. Fe, Cu and Pb are mostly associated with the organics/sulfides fraction. Cr and Zn are mostly associated with FMO. Mn is primarily associated with carbonates, and Co is nearly equally distributed between the FMO and organics/sulfide fractions. Conclusion: This study clearly demonstrates that near-surface lake sediment pore water redox stratification and associated solid phase geochemistry vary significantly with season. This has important ramifications for seasonal changes in the bioavailability and mobility of trace elements. Without rate measurements, it is not possible to quantify the contribution of various processes to natural organic matter degradation. However, the pore water and solid phase data suggest that iron reduction and sulfate reduction are the dominant pathways in the upper 50 cm of these sediments.																			1467-4866					DEC 20	2006	7								11	10.1186/1467-4866-7-11	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1467-4866-7-11								17181862					WOS:000243718200001
J	HEADRICK, MR; CARLINE, RF				HEADRICK, MR; CARLINE, RF			RESTRICTED SUMMER HABITAT AND GROWTH OF NORTHERN PIKE IN 2 SOUTHERN OHIO IMPOUNDMENTS	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Available summer habitat for northern pike Esox lucius in southern Ohio impoundments is restricted by warm epilimnetic temperatures and anoxic bottom waters. We used temperature-sensitive radio transmitters to determine locations of adult northern pike in two impoundments, and we related seasonal growth of other tagged fish to availability of suitable habitat. We implanted transmitters in eight fish in one lake and nine fish in the other; fish locations were monitored from April to October. Condition factors were highest in spring and lowest in late summer. Individually tagged fish lost weight during summer. At the onset of summer thermal stratification, fish moved from inshore to offshore locations that were frequently associated with macrophytes or bottom structures such as submerged stream channels. When lake surface temperatures exceeded 25-degrees-C, fish were found in the coolest available water with dissolved oxygen concentrations of at least 3.0 mg/L, and they were restricted to this stratum for 2-3 months. Although northern pike lost weight during the period of habitat constriction, their annual growth exceeded the average for the species.																			0002-8487					MAR	1993	122	2					228	236		10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<0228:RSHAGO>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<0228:RSHAGO>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1993LL92100006
J	Noges, T; Solovjova, I				Noges, T; Solovjova, I			The formation and dynamics of deep bacteriochlorophyll maximum in the temperate and partly meromictic Lake Verevi	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Vertical distribution of phytoplankton and the formation of deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) in the metalimnion of a small stratified and partly meromictic temperate lake was studied in 1999 and 2000. During summer DCM usually occurred on the borderline of H2S and oxygen-containing waters. At the depths where the bacteriochlorophyll (Bchl) maxima were observed, the sulphide concentration was usually relatively low compared to the bottom layers, where its concentration reached as high as possible saturation level. In April 2000, DCM was formed at the depth of 3.5 m, and lowered thereafter slowly to 6.5 in by October. The concentration of Bchl d reached the highest values (over 1000 mu g l(-1)) just before the water column was mixed up in autumn. In December and April Bchl d was detectable only near the bottom of the lake. The concentration of chlorophyll a yielded by the spectrophotometric phaeopigment corrected method and by HPLC (high pressure liquid chromatography), fit rather well in the upper layers. In deeper water layers chlorophyll a concentration (Chl a) measured by spectrophotometry was overestimated about 47 times if compared to HPLC values because of the high Bchl d in that layer. In most cases vertical profiles of primary production (PP) did not coincide with the vertical distribution of the pigment content; the maximum values of PP were found in the epilimnion. In some cases PP had notably high values also at the depth of DCM. In the upper layers Chl a usually did not exceeded 20 mu g l(-1) in spring and 10 mu g l(-1) in summer. The moderately high Chl a in the epilimnion in spring was significantly reduced after the formation of thermocline most probably because of the establishment of the nutrient limitation in epilimnion. Decreasing Chl a concentration in the epilimnion led to increased water transparency and better light conditions for photosynthetic bacteria in metalimnion.

J	MOORE, FR				MOORE, FR			DYNAMICS OF SEASONAL DISTRIBUTION OF GREAT LAKES HERRING GULLS	BIRD-BANDING												The dynamics of seasonal distribution in herring gulls [Larus argentatus] from the Great Lakes [USA, Canada] are presented, and various age-dependent aspects are emphasized. Over 12,500 band recoveries were analyzed with the aid of a Fortran computer program (GULL). Additional information on winter distribution was taken from Christmas Bird Counts. Postbreeding dispersal from the breeding colonies occurs during the fall period, Aug.-Nov. Age-dependent movement is characteristic of the winter months. With increasing age, herring gulls display increasing sedentariness, culminating with adults remaining winter residents on the Great Lakes. In addition to specifying the dynamics of herring gull dispersal and distribution, these results contribute to a better understanding of the importance of this potentially hazardous species relative to bird-aircraft collision problems, the phenomenon of partial migration and, indirectly, the age-dependent orientation needs of this species.																			0006-3630						1976	47	2					141	159		10.2307/4512215	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4512215													WOS:A1976BU76800008

However, little is known about its effectiveness in controlling P across a wide range of lake conditions or of its potential to promote rapid ecological recovery. We combined data from 18 treated lakes to examine the lake population responses in the 24 months following La-bentonite application (range of La-bentonite loads: 1.4-6.7 tonnes ha(-1)) in concentrations of surface water total phosphorus (TP; data available from 15 lakes), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP; 14 lakes), and chlorophyll a (15 lakes), and in Secchi disk depths (15 lakes), aquatic macrophyte species numbers (6 lakes) and aquatic macrophyte maximum colonisation depths (4 lakes) across the treated lakes. Data availability varied across the lakes and variables, and in general monitoring was more frequent closer to the application dates. Median annual TP concentrations decreased significantly across the lakes, following the La-bentonite applications (from 0.08 mg L-1 in the 24 months pre application to 0.03 mg L-1 in the 24 months post-application), particularly in autumn (0.08 mg L-1 to 0.03 mg L-1) and winter (0.08 mg L-1 to 0.02 mg L-1). Significant decreases in SRP concentrations over annual (0.019 mg L-1 to 0.005 mg L-1), summer (0.018 mg L-1 to 0.004 mg L-1), autumn (0.019 mg L-1 to 0.005 mg L-1) and winter (0.033 mg L-1 to 0.005 mg L-1) periods were also reported. P concentrations following La-bentonite application varied across the lakes and were correlated positively with dissolved organic carbon concentrations. Relatively weak, but significant responses were reported for summer chlorophyll a concentrations and Secchi disk depths following La-bentonite applications, the 75th percentile values decreasing from 119 mu g L-1 to 74 mu g L-1 and increasing from 398 cm to 506 cm, respectively. Aquatic macrophyte species numbers and maximum colonisation depths increased following La-bentonite application from a median of 5.5 species to 7.0 species and a median of 1.8 m to 2.5 m, respectively. The aquatic macrophyte responses varied significantly between lakes. La-bentonite application resulted in a general improvement in water quality leading to an improvement in the aquatic macrophyte community within 24 months. However, because, the responses were highly site-specific, we stress the need for comprehensive pre- and post-application assessments of processes driving ecological structure and function in candidate lakes to inform future use of this and similar products.

Distributive Features of Dissolved Organic Carbon in Aquatic Systems in the Source Area of the Yellow River on the Northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is the main participant in carbon cycles through water pathways. Recent studies have highlighted the roles of aquatic systems in landscape and watershed carbon budgets. This study is based on 261 samples collected between 2016 and 2017, from individual water types (e.g., river/stream, lake/pond, icing/spring, snow/rain, groundwater/ice, and others) in the source area of the Yellow River (SAYR). These samples were analyzed for examining the distributive features of DOC in aquatic systems, especially in relation to environmental factors. It shows that: 1) DOC concentrations in permafrost-related waters (7.2-234.4 mg C center dot L-1) were often the highest among all aquatic DOC sources (lakes/ponds: 21.3 +/- 34.1 mg C center dot L-1, rivers/streams: 4.3 +/- 3.7 mg C center dot L-1, and groundwater: 1.8 +/- 1.4 mg C center dot L-1); 2) the seasonality of riverine DOC showed declining features in 2016 and high in summer/autumn, followed by a spring freshet in 2017, and a close association with intra-annual precipitation modes; 3) the main controls of aquatic DOC are permafrost presence, precipitation, and NDVI, and they contribute to 38% of variances of environmental variables in affecting variations in aquatic DOC in the SAYR; and 4) a literature review on biodegradable DOC (BDOC) of varied aquatic DOC pools indicates the highest DOC concentrations (48-1,548 mg C center dot L-1) and BDOC (23-71%) of ground-ice meltwater. Thus, we suggest that in the SAYR, permafrost dynamics dominate aquatic DOC distribution, and permafrost thaw may alter aquatic DOC budgets, eventually becoming an additional source for atmospheric carbon emissions.					; Gao, shuhui/KYR-2542-2024; Li, Yan/AAL-8997-2021; Luo, Dongliang/Q-9637-2016; Wang, Qingfeng/JTT-1258-2023; Serban, Raul-David/AER-2811-2022	Yan, Li/0000-0002-3332-8040; Serban, Raul-David/0000-0003-2924-2735; Ma, Qiang/0000-0002-7477-1743; 														2296-6463				JUN 8	2022	10								892524	10.3389/feart.2022.892524	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2022.892524													WOS:000814361600001

J	TILZER, MM; BEESE, B				TILZER, MM; BEESE, B			THE SEASONAL PRODUCTIVITY CYCLE OF PHYTOPLANKTON AND CONTROLLING FACTORS IN LAKE CONSTANCE	SCHWEIZERISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR HYDROLOGIE-SWISS JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Annual phytoplankton productivity in Lake Constance is about 300 g C m-2, a value typical for meseutrophic lakes. Seasonal variations in phytoplankton biomass and productivity are exceptionally great because of a sequence of factors controlling the production process: During winter productivity is controlled by low energy inputs and high respiratory losses due to deep column mixing. Biomass is low and water transparency high. The spring phytoplankton growth is triggered by the thermal stabilization of the water column. The summer phytoplankton biomass maximum mainly depends on phosphorus availability. However, biomass yields comprise only 15-20% of values to be expected from the Redfield ratio because large proportions of POM are detritus and non-algal biota. Moreover, sedimentation during the second half of the year removes biomass from the euphotic zone. Water transparency and thus vertical distribution of algal photosynthesis is highly dependent on phytoplankton biomass. Self-shading causes considerably smaller seasonal variations in areal biomass and photosynthetic rates than in volume-based values. By light-shade adaptation effects of seasonal fluctations in mean daily surface radiance fluxes on algal photosynthesis can to a significant extent be compensated for. At any given level of biomass daylength is the major determinant of daily production rates.																			0036-7842					MAY	1988	50	1					1	39		10.1007/BF02538370	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02538370													WOS:A1988N689800001

Mean winds, temperatures and the 16-and 5-day planetary waves in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere over Bear Lake Observatory (42° N, 111° W)	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Atmospheric temperatures and winds in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere have been measured simultaneously using the Aura satellite and a meteor radar at Bear Lake Observatory (42 degrees N, 111 degrees W), respectively. The data presented in this study is from the interval March 2008 to July 2011. The mean winds observed in the summer-time over Bear Lake Observatory show the meridional winds to be equatorward at meteor heights during April-August and to reach monthly-mean velocities of -12 m s(-1). The mean winds are closely related to temperatures in this region of the atmosphere and in the summer the coldest mesospheric temperatures occur about the same time as the strongest equatorward meridional winds. The zonal winds are eastward through most of the year and in the summer strong eastward zonal wind shears of up to similar to 4.5 m s(-1) km(-1) are present. However, westward winds are observed at the upper heights in winter and sometimes during the equinoxes. Considerable inter-annual variability is observed in the mean winds and temperatures. Comparisons of the observed winds with URAP and HWM-07 reveal some large differences. Our radar zonal wind observations are generally more eastward than predicted by the URAP model zonal winds. Considering the radar meridional winds, in comparison to HWM-07 our observations reveal equatorward flow at all meteor heights in the summer whereas HWM-07 suggests that only weakly equatorward, or even poleward flows occur at the lower heights. However, the zonal winds observed by the radar and modelled by HWM-07 are generally similar in structure and strength. Signatures of the 16- and 5-day planetary waves are clearly evident in both the radar-wind data and Aura-temperature data. Short-lived wave events can reach large amplitudes of up to similar to 15 m s(-1) and 8K and 20 m s(-1) and 10K for the 16- and 5-day waves, respectively. A clear seasonal and short-term variability are observed in the 16- and 5-day planetary wave amplitudes. The 16-day wave reaches largest amplitude in winter and is also present in summer, but with smaller amplitudes. The 5-day wave reaches largest amplitude in winter and in late summer. An inter-annual variability in the amplitude of the planetary waves is evident in the four years of observations. Some 41 episodes of large-amplitude wave occurrence are identified. Temperature and wind amplitudes for these episodes, A(T) and A(W), that passed the Student T-test were found to be related by, A(T) = 0.34 A(W) and A(T) = 0.62 A(W) for the 16- and 5-day wave, respectively.																			1680-7316	1680-7324					2012	12	3					1571	1585		10.5194/acp-12-1571-2012	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-12-1571-2012													WOS:000300656500022

The water samples were evaluated to decide the following: (1) whether carbon fixation was N-limited and whether there were differences between picoplankton and larger phytoplankters and (2) the relative importance of picoplankton carbon fixation and related photosynthetic parameters. Evidence of N-limitation was observed only in September at the midlake station for the populations at 50 and 75 m, and to a lesser extent at the nearshore station at 75 m, but only for the nanoplankton fraction. The contribution of picoplankton to total carbon fixation ranged from 34 to 69% and did not increase with depth. Low values for I-k, the photoadaptation parameter, for deep water populations (0.1% light level) in September, but not May, suggested that these populations were adapted to low light in the fall but not the spring.																			0706-652X					JAN	1995	52	1					54	62		10.1139/f95-005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f95-005													WOS:A1995RG86000005

Short-range dispersal and overwintering habitats of boll weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) during and after harvest in the subtropics	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY												Field experiments in the subtropical Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas were conducted to determine the extent of adult boll weevil, Anthonomus grandis grandis Boheman (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), dispersal from cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., fields during harvest operations and the noncotton-growing ("overwinter') period between 1 September and 1 February. Using unbaited large capacity boll weevil traps placed at intervals extending outward from commercial field edges, boll weevils did not move in substantial numbers during harvest much beyond 30 m, primarily in the direction of prevailing winds. From traps placed in fallow cotton; citrus; lake edge; pasture; treeline; sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench, and sugarcane, Saccharum, spp., habitats during the overwinter period, the most boll weevils were collected in the fallow cotton fields and adjacent treelines during the fall. However, the greatest abundances of boll weevils were found in citrus orchards in the spring, before newly planted cotton fields began to square. One of the three lake edges also harbored substantial populations in the spring. Egg development in females was not detected between November and April, but in cotton fields most females were gravid between May and August when cotton fruiting bodies were available. Mated females, as determined by discoloration of the spermatheca, made up 80-100% of the female population during November and December but declined to approximate to 50% in February. The lower incidence of mating indicates a reduction in physical activity, regardless of overwinter habitat, until percentages increased in March and April after cotton fields had been planted and squares were forming.																			0022-0493	1938-291X				AUG	2006	99	4					1152	1160											16937667					WOS:000239537800015

Observed and projected trends in spring flood discharges for the Upper Harricana River, eastern boreal Canada	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: In northwestern Que & PRIME;bec, the Upper Harricana River is representative of the Abitibi Plains' hydrological dynamics over the last 250 years. Study focus: Planning for future spring flood risks involves uncertainties. This research presents a multicentury evaluation of changes in spring mean discharge and flood drivers using streamflow reconstruction (1771-2016), observations (1915-2020) and projections (2021-2100). New hydrological insights for the region: Using a downscaled CMIP5 ensemble of 10 global climate models (GCMs), generalized additive mixed modeling of mean spring discharge projections matched those of an independent mechanistic model and eight GCMs projected variability in spring discharge by 2100 to be similar to the historical variability reconstructed for the last 250 years across the Abitibi Plains. Results indicate that the projected decline in snow cover (-20 to -30% annual snowfall) and rise in winter and spring temperature may be offset by a greater contribution of rainfall to spring high discharge (+100 to +125 mm). However, two GCMs projected an increase in the magnitude and frequency of high mean spring discharge for the Abitibi Plains. By investigating future mean spring discharge for the Upper Harricana River in reference to past reconstructed variability, this study provides insights to inform the future management of regional water resources. The importance of estimating future regional flood risks from the behavior of multi-model ensembles is highlighted.					; NOLIN, Alexandre/AID-1797-2022	Girardin, Martin/0000-0003-0436-7486; NOLIN, Alexandre Florent/0000-0003-1033-9123; Boucher, Marie-Amelie/0000-0002-4246-2444														2214-5818				AUG	2023	48								101462	10.1016/j.ejrh.2023.101462	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2023.101462		JUL 2023											WOS:001055483300001

Sinking loss is another factor that influences the dynamics of cyanobacteria in lakes. However, to date, it is still unclear how the sinking property of Microcystis responds to nitrogen availability. Our results suggest that nitrogen limitation would directly influence sinking property of Microcystis, through a significant increase in the specific density of cells. In the short term, carbohydrate accumulation was mainly responsible for the high specific density, showing a high correlation among the NO3--N concentration, specific density and carbohydrate content Furthermore, carbohydrates could rapidly accumulate after one light/dark cycle, which was mainly due to the reduction in carbohydrate consumption in the darkness under nitrogen limitation. Under nitrogen-light coupling conditions, the specific density ranged from 1.060 to 1.068, except for the treatment with high-nitrogen plus low-light, which showed the value of 1.032. More importantly, when coupled with low nitrogen, the low light did not decrease the carbohydrate content and the specific density, which implied that the sinking cells could not migrate back to the surface. Accordingly, a hypothesis was proposed that the carbohydrate accumulation induced by low nitrogen availability caused an increase in specific density, which invalidates the buoyancy regulation, and cells sink continually out of the water column. This study explores a new understanding on the disappearance mechanisms of Microcystis blooms in the late summer and fall. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

High-resolution Na lidar measurements were taken throughout the diurnal and annual cycle (1996-98) at Urbana, Illinois (40 degrees N, 88 degrees W) to characterize the seasonal behavior of the 24, 12, 8 and 6-hr tides. Complementary measurements using a recently developed CCD imager capable of mapping OH temperature (at similar to 87 km altitude) were made from Bear Lake Observatory, Utah (41.9 degrees N, 111.6 degrees W) and Ft. Collins, Colorado(40.6 degrees N, 105 degrees W) within the same time period. The "mean day" lidar data for the spring and fall periods investigated here each indicate an average amplitude variation of similar to 2-5 K over the depth of the OH layer but distinct phases of <1-hr LST and similar to 7-hr LST respectively, for the 8-hr component. The Temperature Mapper data are in excellent agreement with these findings but in addition have shown that the amplitude of this tidal component can vary by as much as an order of magnitude (1.5-15 K) on a night-by-night basis resulting in an apparent 8-hr dominance of the nocturnal variation during investigated portions of the spring and fall seasons with little or no diurnal and semi-diurnal variability evident. Reports of terdiurnal tidal measurements in the mid-latitude nightglow emissions are exceptionally rare and have yet to be modeled. These innovative joint measurements pave the way for new research in this important area.																			1343-8832						1999	51	7-8					877	885		10.1186/BF03353246	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/BF03353246													WOS:000082916200040

Dust storm frequency and impact over Eastern Australia determined by state of Pacific climate system	WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES												Dust storms resulting from synoptic-scale mid-latitude frontal systems affect inland, eastern Australia, predominantly through spring and summer but extend to the east coast only rarely when strong, frontal westerly winds crossing the continent are sustained over the coast. Here it is shown that extreme westerly wind dust events are anomalous to the more pervasive southerly winds that have shaped the sand dunes over inland eastern Australia. It is also shown that while antecedent dry conditions are very important, higher SON and DJF dust storm frequencies from 1957 to the mid-1970s occurred due to both anomalously strong, southerly winds existing on the western side of a cyclonic anomaly adjacent to the east Australian coast, which resulted from the state of the Pacific climate system, and an anticyclonic anomaly at the top of the Great Australian Bight. A change in BoM observing practice, after 1973, is unlikely to be the major cause of changes in total dust frequency from the mid-1970s. Rather, extreme rainfall years are more likely to have been a major contributing factor to the large decreases in dust occurrence from 1973 to 1976, in addition to the other La Nina periods of 2000/01 to 2010/11. Synoptic scale frontal systems in the westerlies that result in the transport of dust remained low in frequency throughout the whole period from 1957 to 2011. However, those dust storms in the westerlies that do reach the east coast, although infrequent, tend to occur during El Nino-dominated years. On the other hand, they occur during both negative and positive phases of the southern annular mode (SAM). This ambiguity with the SAM phase is consistent with the fact that the mid-latitude westerlies and associated frontal systems are usually at their most equatorward position in Australian longitudes in late winter/spring regardless of the SAM phase. This suggests little change is likely in the frequency of westerly induced dust storms in late winter/spring over central/eastern Australia even though the seasonal westerly winds are expected to contract further poleward under increased global warming. However, a complicating factor is that the increasing likelihood of longer dry spells under climate change would imply reduced vegetation for longer periods over the dust-prone source region of Lake Eyre basin, which could worsen the impact of dust storm events. Furthermore, longer dry spells throughout the year would increase the risk of more frequent westerly dust storm events in other seasons when strong, westerly frontal systems can also occur.

Banding data indicate ASY [after second year] birds of both sexes and SY females arrive about the same time whereas arrival of SY males is about 12 days later. Encounters of banded sharp-shins suggest an autumn migratory route along the west side of Lake Superior, north side of Lake Erie, and through the Sault Ste. Marie area into Michigan and Wisconsin. Movement is then south toward Mexico and Central America. During spring, they are funneled up to Whitefish Point along both sides of Lake Michigan. The 26 km of Lake Superior between Whitefish Point and Canada appear to be an obstacle for many birds; there is evidence that birds linger around the point for up to several days, as well as engage in reverse migration to avoid an overwater flight.																			0273-8570	1557-9263				FAL	1985	56	4					346	355																WOS:A1985A610900003

Lake Sturgeon Movement after Trap and Transfer around Two Dams on the Menominee River, Wisconsin-Michigan	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Fish behavior after passage or transfer around dams is a critical component in determining whether the goals of these efforts are achieved, but these behaviors are often poorly understood. An elevator was constructed in the lowermost hydroelectric dam on the Menominee River, Wisconsin-Michigan; it is the first elevator specifically designed to capture Lake Sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens for upstream transfer above two dams, providing access to high-quality spawning and early life habitat. Our objectives were to determine whether (1) Lake Sturgeon transferred upstream remained upstream for at least one spawning opportunity; (2) spawning opportunity, time to reach the next dam upstream, and residency in different segments of the river were related to sex, capture method (elevator versus electrofishing), and season of transfer; and (3) the probability of fish transitioning back downstream of the two dams varied among months. We evaluated posttransfer behaviors of 139 Lake Sturgeon that were captured in the elevator or by electrofishing, implanted with acoustic transmitters, transferred upstream (in spring or fall) from fall 2014 to spring 2017, and monitored until fall 2018 using 20-23 stationary acoustic receivers deployed throughout the river. Most Lake Sturgeon (91%) remained upstream for at least one spawning opportunity. The probability of remaining for one spawning opportunity was not related to sex, fish capture method, or season of transfer. Residency times within the two impoundments and time to reach the next dam upstream varied among individual fish. A multistate model indicated that monthly survival after upstream transfer was high and that Lake Sturgeon typically remained above both dams in late fall to early spring, with most downstream movements occurring in April and May. Our results indicate that Lake Sturgeon transferred upstream have the potential to contribute offspring that may help to bolster the Lake Sturgeon population in Lake Michigan, but additional research may help in determining whether these contributions occur. Impact Statement Lake Sturgeon that were transferred upstream of two dams remained upstream of the dams for at least one spawning opportunity, representing the first step in determining whether transfers can be used to increase Lake Sturgeon abundance in the Great Lakes and beyond.

However, the strategies for enhancing water quality through landscape pattern management remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to provide effective guidance for water quality management by quantifying the key spatial scales and landscape metrics that influence the seasonal variations in water quality and establishing threshold relationships between these metrics and abrupt variations in water quality in the Chaohu Lake basin, China. Results discovered that water quality was poorer in summer and better in spring, with degraded water conditions primarily concentrated in the middle and lower reaches of the watershed. The 100 m riparian zone buffer scale landscape pattern was identified as the key scale affecting water quality in the summer, which accounted for 51.3% of the overall water quality variation. Furthermore, abrupt threshold analysis indicated that summer water quality could be effectively improved by maintaining the proportion and largest patch index of construction land within the 100 m riparian buffer below 22.0%. At the sub-basin scale, landscape pattern-based water quality management was most effective in spring, explaining 43.6% of the variation in water quality. Setting the largest patch index of construction land at the subbasin scale below 43.0% and increasing the proportion of forest cover above 36.0% can also alleviate water pollution issues. These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating landscape patterns across scales into environment management decisions, providing a scientific basis for effective watershed water quality management.

The Yinchuan Plain, located in the Gobi of Northwest China, has a strong surface ET, which has a significant impact on the regional water resource cycle. However, there is a current lack of high-resolution evapotranspiration datasets and a substantial amount of time is required for long-time series remote sensing evapotranspiration estimation. In order to assess the ET pattern in this region, we obtained the actual ET (ETa) of the Yinchuan Plain between 1987 and 2020 using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Specifically, we used Landsat TM+/OLI remote sensing imagery and the GEE Surface Energy Balance Model (geeSEBAL) to analyze the spatial distribution pattern of ET over different seasons. We then reproduced the interannual variation in ET from 1987 to 2020, and statistically analyzed the distribution patterns and contributions of ET with regard to different land use types. The results show that (1) the daily ETa of the Yinchuan Plain is the highest in the central lake wetland area in spring, with a maximum value of 4.32 mm day(-1); in summer, it is concentrated around the croplands and water bodies, with a maximum value of 6.90 mm day(-1); in autumn and winter, it is mainly concentrated around the water bodies and impervious areas, with maximum values of 3.93 and 1.56 mm day(-1), respectively. (2) From 1987 to 2020, the ET of the Yinchuan Plain showed an obvious upward and downward trend in some areas with significant land use changes, but the overall ET of the region remained relatively stable without dramatic fluctuations. (3) The ETa values for different land use types in the Yinchuan Plain region are ranked as follows: water body > cultivated land > impervious > grassland > bare land. Our results showed that geeSEBAL is highly applicable in the Yinchuan Plain area. It allows for the accurate and detailed inversion of ET and has great potential for evaluating long-term ET in data-scarce areas due to its low meteorological sensitivity, which facilitates the study of the regional hydrological cycle and water governance.

Thus, factors influencing the formation of water runoff during the spring flood are paramount. We explain changes in the isotopic composition of the Upper Ob surface waters by changing different components' contribution to the runoff water discharge over the spring flood period. We suggest estimating the time of meltwater flow from the Upper Ob watershed to the outlet section using the difference between the date of the complete melting of the snow cover in the catchment area and the date of the maximum light isotope composition of water in the outlet section. We show that a sharp short-term weighting of the isotopic composition of water in the river at the end of the first phase of the flood may be associated with the influx of autumn soil moisture, displaced from the soils by snowmelt waters.

J	Henkin, Z; Walczak, M; Kaplan, D				Henkin, Z.; Walczak, M.; Kaplan, D.			Dynamics of vegetation development on drained peat soils of the Hula Valley, Israel	MIRES AND PEAT												Lake Hula and its neighbouring peatland in the upper Galilee, Israel were drained during the 1950s. For about 40 years after drainage most of the area was under continuous intensive cultivation with rain-fed winter crops and irrigated summer crops. In 1994 an area of about 110 ha of mainly peat soil was re-flooded and 350 ha surrounding it were partly taken out of intensive agricultural use. The surrounding area was still cultivated under rain-fed conditions in the cool winter season, but left fallow during the hot, dry summer. The summer vegetation was mowed periodically to promote the development of a continuous sward cover for recreation and control of wind erosion. The goal of this research was to study the relationship between dynamic changes in the soil and water conditions and the composition and species distribution of the spontaneous summer vegetation. During four consecutive years the vegetation dynamics were characterised by increasing dominance of Cynodon dactylon and Sorghum halepense. Cyperus rotundus, which was common under irrigated cultivation, partly disappeared under the new non-irrigated regime. The density and growth rate of the vegetation mainly reflected differences in the water table depth, which varied between 0.5 m and 3 m. Three years after re-flooding, soil salinity was high in areas where the water table was higher than 0.5 m and in dry patches where almost no cover of vegetation was found. In these sites the concentration of mineral nitrogen (N-NO3 and/or N-NH4) was especially high. A continuous vegetation cover developed on the peat soil in areas where the depth of the water table was between 1 m and 2 m. Mowing the vegetation periodically in summer suppressed the growth of tall, weedy species and promoted the dominance of Cynodon dactylon creating a dense, productive sward.																			1819-754X						2011	9				SI		14	24	02															WOS:000209451300003

The species involvedare C. farionis (Muller, 1784) and Crepidostomum wikgreni Gibson et Valtonen, 1988, which differed from C. farionis in the number and size of the eggs. Both types were encountered in the gall-bladder and intestine, but were unable to be distinguished as immature stages. 21% of the brown trout harboured C. farionis in the intestine with a mean number of 1.5 worms per infected fish. Two C. farionis specimens occurred also in the intestine of one vendace. Whitefish smaller than 150 mm did not harbour Crepidostomum specimens, but in bigger fish the prevalence and the mean intensity of infection increased to a certain limit as the fish got larger. The prevalence of Crepidostomum infection also clearly increased during the three seasons in the three sized-groups studied. The seasonal pattern of Crepidostomum in whitefish of the size .gtoreq. 150 mm was variable in that the lowest values, both in the prevalence and mean intensity of infection, occurred between September and December in 1980 and between April and August in 1982. Reinvasion was found throughout the year, although the main recruitment occurred during autumn and early winter. Eggs matured between late spring and early autumn. The smallest worms occurred mainly in the gall-bladder, and most of the gravid specimens were located in the intestine. Both the variance-to-mean ratio and the low values of the parameter k of the fitted negative binomial distribution reveal the Crepidostomum specimens are overdispersed in the whitefish of Lake Yli-Kitka.																			0015-5683	1803-6465					1989	36	1					13	24											2767545					WOS:A1989T701600003

Preconditioning of an underflow during ice-breakup in a subarctic lake	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The fate of inflows into lakes has been extensively studied during summer stratification but has seen relatively little focus during the weak winter stratification, with or without ice-cover. Field observations are presented of groundwater inflow into a shallow bay of a subarctic lake. Atmospheric forcing of the bay during the study period was extremely variable and coincided with spring ice-cover break-up. Two dominant wind regimes were identified; (1) weak wind-forcing (wind speed <5 m s(-1) or land-fast ice-cover), and (2) strong wind-forcing (wind speed >5 m s(-1) and open water). At a relatively constant temperature of similar to 3.3 degrees C, the groundwater inflow was closer to the temperature of maximum density than the water in the main body of the lake, which during the observed winter stratification is similar to 1.2 degrees C. During weak wind-forcing, the stratification within Silfra Bay approximated two-layers as this denser groundwater formed a negatively buoyant underflow. A calculated underflow entrainment rate of 2.8 x 10(-3) agrees well with other underflow studies. During strong wind-forcing, the water column out to the mouth of the bay became weakly stratified as the underflow was entrained vertically by wind-stirring. Observed periods of mixing can be predicted to occur when turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) production by wind stirring integrated over the underflow hydraulic residence time in the bay exceeds the potential energy associated with the stratification. A decrease of ice cover, as observed in the studied subarctic lake over the last decade, will result in the underflow being more frequently exposed to the strong wind-forcing regime during winter, thereby altering the winter distribution of groundwater inflow within the lake.					; Laval, Bernard/J-9861-2012; Andradottir, Hrund/M-2013-2015; Forrest, Alexander/C-3765-2014	Andradottir, Hrund/0000-0002-4832-1503; Forrest, Alexander/0000-0002-7853-9765; Laval, Bernard Edmond/0000-0002-4810-9246													1015-1621	1420-9055				APR	2012	74	2					361	374		10.1007/s00027-011-0227-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-011-0227-2													WOS:000302518900012

Ikaite precipitates because of its decreased solubility at low temperature and because of orthophosphate-ion inhibition of calcite and aragonite. During the spring some of the ikaite is transformed to anhydrous CaCO3 and is incorporated into tufa, but most is dispersed by wave action into the lake where it reacts to form gaylussite (Na2Ca(CO3)2.5H2O). Spring waters have low pH values, are dominantly Ca-Na-HCO3, have low radiocarbon activities, and are mixtures of deep-seated geothermal and cold groundwaters. Chemical modeling reveals that precipitation of CaCO3 can occur over a broad range of mixtures of spring and lake water with a maximum production occurring at 96% spring water and 4% lake water. Under these conditions all the Ca and a significant fraction of the CO3 of the precipitate is spring supplied. A radiocarbon age of 19,580 years obtained on a natural ikaite sample supports this conclusion. With the springs supplying a large and probably variable portion of the carbonate, and with apparent C-14 age of the carbonate varying from spring to spring, tufa of similar actual antiquity may yield significantly different C-14 dates, making tufa at this location unsuitable for absolute age dating by the radiocarbon method.

There was an inverse correlation between the abundance of rotifers and crustaceans. Rotifers were most abundant and dominated (> 69%) the rotifer-crustacean biomass during summer months (June-Sept.) while crustacean zooplankton dominated during the remainder of the year (> 89%). Peak biomasses of crustaceans were observed in the fall (151 .mu.g dry wt l-1 in Oct.) and spring (89.66 .mu.g dry wt l-1 in May). Mean annual biomass levels were 46.99 .mu.g dry wt l-1 for crustaceans and 19.26 .mu.g dry wt l-1 for rotifers. Trichocerca rousseleti, Polyarthra sp., Keratella cochlearis and Kellicottia bostoniensis were the most abundant rotifers in the lake. Diaptomus siciloides and Daphnia parvula were the most abundant crustaceans. Lake Oglethorpe is distinct in having an unusally high abundance of rotifers (range 217-7980 l-1). These high densities can be attributed not only to the eutrophic conditions of the lake but also to the detailed sampling methods employed in this study.

We used long-term weekly measurements of the lake's epilimnetic, metalimnetic, and hypolimnetic temperatures and dissolved oxygen concentrations and meteorological forcing variables to estimate long-term trends for each week. Except for large warming trends of air temperatures in the last week of April (0.14 degrees C yr(-1)) and the first week of May (0.11 degrees C yr(-1)), the extent of epilimnetic warming trends during the same time period (similar to 0.06-0.08 degrees C yr(-1)) was also caused by a cumulative effect resulting from an earlier onset of stratification. Negative hypolimnetic temperature trends at the same time (similar to 0.01 degrees C yr(-1)) also resulted from an earlier onset of stratification and increased water-column stability in spring. In summer and autumn, large increases in epilimnetic temperature and water-column stability were also affected by a shift of the timing of the yearly maxima of epilimnetic temperatures and water-column stability, which resulted in a later breakdown of stratification. This annual pattern of long-term trends of epilimnetic and hypolimnetic temperatures agrees with models driven by the expected increase of air temperatures due to anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Due to a prolonged stratification period, oxygen concentrations during the last weeks of the stratified period were lower, although oxygen concentrations in the water column increased within the first weeks of stratification.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	2012	57	5					1479	1491		10.4319/lo.2012.57.5.1479	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2012.57.5.1479													WOS:000308640600018

This study gives insight into the source apportionment and potential ecological and health risks of heavy metals in river sediments of the Urmia Lake basin, a natural world heritage located in northwestern Iran. A comprehensive sediment sampling was conducted in seven major rivers feeding the basin during the summer and winter of 2021. Samples were analyzed for zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and nickel (Ni) contents and a suite of chemical and physical properties. Subsequently, Pollution Index (PI), Pollution Load Index (PLI), Ecological Risk (ER), Hazard Quotients (HQ), Hazard Index (HI), and Carcinogenic Risk (CR) indices were determined. The mean concentration of heavy metals in all rivers' sediments exhibited the descending order of Ni > Zn > Pb > Cu > Cd during both summer and winter. Multivariate analysis suggested that Zn was primarily initiated from natural processes, Cd and Pb were affected by human activities, and Cu along Ni were derived from natural and anthropogenic factors. The PI unveiled that most sediment samples were unpolluted to slightly polluted by Zn, Cu, and Pb, and slightly to moderately polluted by Cd. PLI and ER indices demonstrated that the sediment poses non to moderate pollution and low to moderate ecological risk, respectively. Using a human health risk approach, we found that the HI values of all heavy metals and THI were less than one for children and adults implying non-carcinogenic risk in the analyzed sediments. Carcinogenic effects of Cd and Pb at all rivers sediments via ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact were almost within tolerable risks (1 x 10(-6) to 1 x 10(-4)) for children and adults. PI, PLI, ER, HQ, HI, and CR index values of sediment samples during the summer were higher than those during the winter. This is attributed to the greater heavy metal concentrations and the lower water flow during summer. Our results provide practical information for better management and control of heavy metal pollution in aquatic-sedimentary ecosystems.					; Khodaverdiloo, Habib/AAC-1149-2020; Heidari, Mohammad/M-1039-2019; Nouri gharahassanlou, amin/AHC-4087-2022	Nouri, Amin/0000-0001-8913-8417; 													2045-2322					OCT 19	2022	12	1							17455	10.1038/s41598-022-21752-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-21752-w								36261490					WOS:000870427800034

Stable isotope data can help reconstruct paleoclimate related to ice cores, lake sediments, and stalagmites. We investigated the daily variation in isotopic composition of meteoric precipitation from 2008 to 2012 in the Guilin region of China. delta O-18 of meteoric precipitation ranged from -14.21 to +2.38 aEuro degrees, with an average value of -5.78 aEuro degrees (Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water; VSMOW). Meteoric precipitation in the summer half-year (May through October) increased, with a relatively low delta O-18 value of -8.04 aEuro degrees (VSMOW; average of 261 groups) and -56.03 aEuro degrees (VSMOW) of average delta D, accounting for 67.6 % of the total annual meteoric precipitation. Meteoric precipitation in the winter half-year (November through April) decreased, with a relatively high delta O-18 value of -2.89 aEuro degrees (average of 210 groups) and -9.23 aEuro degrees of average delta D, accounting for 32.4 % of total meteoric precipitation. The local meteoric water line (LMWL) equation in Guilin area has local climate characteristics. By combining environmental isotope data of precipitation using a backwards trajectory, water vapor sources of the meteoric precipitation in Guilin area are inferred and traced. Our results show that the isotopic composition of meteoric water vapor sources in Guilin area are related to monsoon type, source of precipitation cloud masses, and precipitation properties. The isotopic composition of meteoric precipitation in the summer half-year (May through October) was mainly affected by the summer monsoon or summer typhoons, namely controlled by water vapor source from the Bay of Bengal and the South China sea, and the second the West Pacific, and the delta O-18 value of meteoric precipitation was strongly negative. There was a significant negative correlation between the delta O-18 values of meteoric precipitation and the amount of precipitation and temperature in the summer half-year. The amount effect of the meteoric precipitation often concealed the temperature effect. The isotopic composition of meteoric precipitation in the winter season or winter half-year was affected by the water vapor source of the warm moist air masses from the West Pacific and continental cold air masses from the Siberia-Mongolia/winter monsoon or local evaporation vapor circulation, and the delta O-18 value of meteoric precipitation was relatively positive, and indicated that the water vapor of meteoric precipitation along the water vapor trajectory was affected by the evaporation as well as the local water vapor evaporation. The research results have showed that different sources of water vapor has a significant influence on the delta O-18 variation of meteoric precipitation, therefore, analysis of delta O-18 in the meteoric precipitation, especially its seasonal variation characteristics of analysis, can conversely reveal the water vapor sources of local meteoric precipitation.					jianjun, Yin/LDF-1082-2024; Xiaoyan, Zhu/AGI-3291-2022														1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2015	74	2					953	976		10.1007/s12665-014-3827-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-014-3827-z													WOS:000356871500007

Phosphorus losses from agricultural watersheds in the Mississippi Delta	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Phosphorus (P) loss from agricultural fields is of environmental concern because of its potential impact on water quality in streams and lakes. The Mississippi Delta has long been known for its fish productivity and recreational value, but high levels of P in fresh water can lead to algal blooms that have many detrimental effects on natural ecosystems. Algal blooms interfere with recreational and aesthetic water use. However, few studies have evaluated P losses from agricultural watersheds in the Mississippi Delta. To better understand the processes influencing P loss, rainfall, surface runoff, sediment, ortho-P (orthophosphate, PO4-P), and total P (TP) were measured (water years 1996-2000) for two subwatersheds (UL1 and UL2) of the Deep Hollow Lake Watershed and one subwatershed of the Beasley Lake Watershed (BL3) primarily in cotton production in the Mississippi Delta. Ortho-P concentrations ranged from 0.01 to 1.0 mg/L with a mean of 0.17 mg/L at UL1 (17.0 ha), 0.36 mg/L at UL2 (11.2 ha) and 0.12 mg/L at BL3 (7.2 ha). The TP concentrations ranged from 0.14 to 7.9 mg/L with a mean of 0.96 mg/L at UL1, 1.1 mg/L at UL2 and 1.29 mg/L at BL3. Among the three sites, UL1 and UL2 received P application in October 1998, and BL3 received P applications in the spring of 1998 and 1999. At UL1, ortho-P concentrations were 0.36, 0.25 and 0.16 for the first, second and third rainfall events after P application, respectively; At UL2, ortho-P concentrations were 1.0, 0.66 and 0.65 for the first, second and third rainfall events after P application, respectively; and at BL3, ortho-P concentrations were 0.11, 0.22 and 0.09 for the first, second and third rainfall events after P application, respectively. P fertilizer application did influence P losses, but high P concentrations observed in surface runoff were not always a direct result of P fertilizer application or high rainfall. Application of P in the fall (UL1 and UL2) resulted in more ortho-P losses, likely because high rainfall often occurred in the winter months soon after application. The mean ortho-P concentrations were higher at UL1 and UL2 than those at BL3, although BL3 received more P application during the monitoring period, because P was applied in spring at BL3. However, tillage associated with planting and incorporating applied P in the spring (BL3) may have resulted in more TP loss in sediment, thus the mean TP concentration was the highest at BL3. Ortho-P loss was correlated with surface runoff; and TP loss was correlated with sediment loss. These results indicate that applying P fertilizer in the spring may be recommended to reduce potential ortho-P loss during the fallow winter season; in addition, conservation practices may reduce potential TP loss associated with soil loss.

POPULATION MONITORING AND MAJOR THREATS TO DEMOISELLE CRANE (GRUS VIRGO) AT LASBELA COAST, BALOCHISTAN, PAKISTAN	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES-JAPS												The Demoiselle Crane (Grus virgo) is one of the most threatened bird species in the world as it is indicated as "Least Concern" under the IUCN and Bird Life International category. To evaluate the current status and threats to G. virgo from Lasbela coast, two field stations were selected i. e, Siranda lake and Sonmiani area. Data were based on daily observation monitored during February, March, April, September, October, November, and December during 2020-2021. The line transit method and questionnaire-interview based survey was used to estimate the bird population and threats to birds population. Total of 322,143 numbers of cranes were observed in which 142700 in autumn and 179443 during spring season. Area wise distribution of cranes were detected at 271701 from Sarinda lake while, 50442 cranes were observed from Sonmiani area. It was also noted that during autumn overall 136850 cranes were observed in flying mode while 5850 were observed at resting stage, however in Spring 167330 were in flying and 12113 were at resting. Overall, high population was observed during spring season at 55.7% while population during autumn was observed at 44.29%. It was also noted that during present study the percentage of flying cranes are higher than the resting cranes and higher numbers were observed from Sarinda lake compared to Sonmiani area. This maybe because the Sarinda lake is far from city area so cranes prefer to rest compare to Sonmiani area. The hunting information was collected from local community, government agencies and personal visits at local areas. It was noted that total of 116 numbers of cranes were hunted during the study period from which 74 cranes were hunted using gunshot and 42 cranes were caught alive. Most of the hunting cranes were operated during March. We may assume that these sites (study area) are short term stay for these guest birds. However, due to certain reasons it may also be noted that flying cranes are higher than the resting cranes which shows that these sites also indicate the threats to the cranes. It may also suggest that hunting must be prohibited and Sarinda lake should be declared as Ramsar site for the conservation of migratory birds.

The two summers (1992-93) during which this study took place were both drier than normal in the early part of the season. Summer water balance after snowmelt is dominated by evapotranspiration (ET), which exceeds precipitation in both ponds and wetlands. Water levels drop through June and July, when ET is greatest, and recover somewhat during August, when precipitation increases and ET decreases. Ponds and wetlands, which experience a net loss of water over the summer, are filled to capacity by snowmelt runoff in spring. Ponds and wetlands serve as storage sites for snowmelt runoff; the net loss of water over the wetland watershed from the previous summer must be replenished by snowmelt waters before runoff can leave the basin. Annual ET from ponds and wetlands exceeds annual precipitation and, as a result, snowmelt runoff from surrounding upland areas is necessary to maintain wetlands and ponds.

Its biochemical conservatism makes it an important indicator to offshore pollution process. Monitoring the content, composition, and diffusion process of CDOM is a good approach to analyze the terrestrial input, optical properties, and ecological environment of offshore areas. The spatiotemporal characteristics of CDOM around the Leizhou Peninsula were analyzed based on field observation data collected in the autumn 2020 and spring 2021, and an empirical inversion model of the a(g)(355) (absorption coefficient at 355 nm) and spectral slope (S-g) (g stands for gelbstoff/gilvin, which is called CDOM) based on Sentinel-3A ocean and land color instrument (OLCI) images was constructed. The results show (1) the order of average a(g)(355) value around the Leizhou Peninsula was east coast (0.503/m)>Qiongzhou Strait (0.502/m)>west coast (0.365/m); (2) the best band combinations of CDOM inversion in spring and autumn were (B4+B11)/B3 and (B7-B1)/B6 (B stands for the band of spectral images), and the final inversion results are close to the measured results, indicating that the model has good accuracy; (3) the S-g value of the CDOM absorption spectrum was fitted to the hyperbolic-exponential model. The fitting accuracy of the model was higher than those of the exponential model and the hyperbolic model, and the best S-g inversion model was constructed by selecting S-g(275-295) and S-g(250-295) in spring and autumn; (4) the spatial distributions of a(g)(355) and S-g were inverted, and CDOM in the waters around the Leizhou Peninsula originated from terrestrial organic matter carried by coastal aquaculture zones and runoff in the northeast Zhanjiang and the northern Beibu Gulf.

It is a pure anorganic calcite precipitation, caused by the loss of free carbonic acid to the atmosphere during the mixing of epilimnic and hypolimnic water. An essential coprecipitation of phosphorus with the anorganic calcite precipitation could be shown by calcium and phosphorus balances and by SEM investigations. During the epilimnic biogenic calcite precipitation (in summer) phosphorus coprecipitation makes 0.19% of the calcium fallout. Phosphorus coprecipitation increases up to 0.42% during the anorganic calcite precipitation when autumn overturn takes place. With respect to the total phosphorus sedimentation in the lake 25% are coprecipitated with calcite.																			0020-9309						1990	75	2		3			153	173		10.1002/iroh.19900750204	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19900750204													WOS:A1990EQ91700003

To describe their feeding ecology and compare their diets in this zone, sturgeons were sampled during the summer and fall of 2000 by trawling in the main channel and by gill netting in the shallower nearshore habitat. Stomach contents were sampled by gastric lavage of live specimens (trawling) and by digestive tract sampling (gill netting). Relative importance by taxonomic group was based on percent occurrence and percentage of the diet by number and weight for three sturgeon size-classes that corresponded to age-0, Juvenile, and subadult stages. Spatial, seasonal, and life stage variations were observed in the diet composition of both sturgeon species. Age-0 fish of both species fed mainly on gammarids. Juveniles and subadults front both species fed mainly on oligochaetes and gammarids, but in opposite proportions: gammarids were the dominant prey for lake sturgeon and oligochaetes for Atlantic sturgeon. Subadult Atlantic sturgeon also fed on fish in the summer and on insects and mollusks in the nearshore habitat in fall. Vegetal matter was frequent and abundant in the stomach contents of Atlantic sturgeon subadults, especially in the nearshore habitat, and vegetal mass in the diet was correlated with gammarid biomass. In addition to gammarids, the lake sturgeon diet included insects, oligochaetes, and mollusks, whose proportions increased with sturgeon size-class. The proportion of amphipods decreased with size-class during both summer and fall. In the St. Lawrence ETZ, Atlantic sturgeon appear to be specialist feeders while lake sturgeon appear to be more often generalists. Diet diversity was higher in lake sturgeon, which fed on all of the 15 taxa identified in the macrobenthos of the ETZ; the diet of Atlantic sturgeon consisted of 10 taxa. In the main channel in fall, dietary overlap between Atlantic sturgeon and lake sturgeon was low for the juvenile and subadult life stages. The strong dependence of Atlantic sturgeon and lake sturgeon on oligochaetes and gammarids suggests that the areas where these benthic assemblages are found, near the freshwater-saltwater limit, are important feeding habitats for the age-0, juvenile, and subadult stages of both sturgeon species.																			0892-2284		978-1-888569-91-9				2007	56						85	+																WOS:000247562200005
J	KONOPKA, A; BROCK, TD				KONOPKA, A; BROCK, TD			EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON BLUE-GREEN-ALGAE (CYANOBACTERIA) IN LAKE MENDOTA	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The temperature optimum for photosynthesis of natural populations of blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) from Lake Mendota [Wisconsin, USA] was determined during the period of June-Nov. 1976. In the spring, when temperatures ranged from 0-20.degree. C, there were insignificant amounts of blue-green algae in the lake (less than 1% of the biomass). During the summer and fall, when the dominant phytoplankton was blue-green algae, the optimum temperature for photosynthesis was usually between 20-30.degree. C, whereas the environmental temperatures during this period ranged from 24.degree. C in Aug. to 12.degree. C in Nov. In general, the optimum temperature for photosynthesis was higher than the environmental temperature. More importantly, significant photosynthesis also occurred at low temperature in these samples, which suggests that the low temperature alone is not responsible for the absence of blue-green algae in Lake Mendota during the spring. Temperature optima for growth and photosynthesis of laboratory cultures of the 3 dominant blue-green algae in Lake Mendota were determined. The responses of the 2 parameters to changes in temperature were similar; thus, photosynthesis appears to be a valid index of growth. However, there was little photosynthesis by laboratory cultures at low temperatures, in contrast to the natural samples. Evidence for an interaction between temperature and low light intensities in their effect on photosynthesis of natural samples is presented.																			0099-2240	1098-5336					1978	36	4					572	576		10.1128/AEM.36.4.572-576.1978	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.36.4.572-576.1978								16345318					WOS:A1978FS50900007
J	Straile, D; Jöhnk, K; Rossknecht, H				Straile, D; Jöhnk, K; Rossknecht, H			Complex effects of winter warming on the physicochemical characteristics of a deep lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Recent winter warming over Central Europe associated with a positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) strongly influenced the thermal and water column stability properties of deep Lake Constance (z(mean) = 101 m). Volumetrically weighted average water temperatures have increased since the 1960s by an average of 0.017degreesC yr(-1), and its interannual variability was strongly related to the variability in winter air temperature and the NAO winter index (NAO(w)). The influence of NAO(w) on water temperature was more persistent than its influence on air temperature. The seasonal persistence of the NAO(w) signal increased with water depth. Deep-water temperatures were related to the NAO(w) from one spring mixing period to the next. This caused a time lag of 1 yr in the response of deep-water winter temperatures to the NAO(w). Reduced winter cooling during high-NAO(w) years resulted in the persistence of small temperature gradients that possibly resisted complete mixing. This, in turn, resulted in less upward mixing of nutrients (total phosphorus and total silica), which accumulated in the hypolimnion during the previous stratification period. A second effect of incomplete mixing was the lack of the replenishment of deep-water oxygen during high-NAO(w) years. Hence, besides its strong impact on the thermal regime, climate variability influenced both the causes (nutrient supply for phytoplankton growth) and symptoms (the degree of hypolimnetic oxygen deficiency) of trophic changes in Lake Constance.

J	Jonsson, A; Ström, L; Åberg, J				Jonsson, Anders; Strom, Lena; Aberg, Jan			Composition and variations in the occurrence of dissolved free simple organic compounds of an unproductive lake ecosystem in northern Sweden	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Low molecular weight organic carbon compounds are potentially important carbon and energy substrates to heterotrophic production in the aquatic environment. We studied the occurrence of dissolved free amino acids (AA), monosaccharides (CHO), and carboxylic acids (CA) in the subarctic Lake Diktar-Erik. The lake is unproductive with slightly humic water, and receives water via one major inlet stream draining a birch forest environment. The concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the inlet stream was strongly correlated with the discharge. This relationship changed from season to season, indicating changes in the sources of the DOC entering the stream. AA and CHO each accounted for an average of less than 0.5% of the DOC. After high discharge events during the ice-free period, AA and CHO occurred in especially high concentrations. CA occurred in higher concentrations during the ice-free period, when it generally accounted for 20-30% of the DOC pool. The CA content relative to the total DOC pool was strongly inversely correlated with overall DOC concentration, and at low DOC levels the relative content of CA was high and vice versa. This followed a seasonal trend, with CA accounting for a smaller proportion of the DOC in winter and a larger part in spring/early summer. A conservative estimate suggested that the studied simple organic carbon compounds potentially could cover 30% of the bacterial gross production in the lake and therefore potentially also was an important source of CO2 that occur in supersaturated concentrations in the lake.																			0168-2563					FEB	2007	82	2					153	163		10.1007/s10533-006-9060-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-006-9060-4													WOS:000243554400004

Substantial increase in minimum lake surface temperatures under climate change	CLIMATIC CHANGE												The annual minimum of lake surface water temperature influences ecological and biogeochemical processes, but variability and change in this extreme have not been investigated. Here, we analysed observational data from eight European lakes and investigated the changes in annual minimum surface water temperature. We found that between 1973 and 2014, the annual minimum lake surface temperature has increased at an average rate of + 0.35 degrees Cdecade(-1), comparable to the rate of summer average lake surface temperature change during the same period (+ 0.32 degrees C decade(-1)). Coherent responses to climatic warming are observed between the increase in annual minimum lake surface temperature and the increase in winter air temperature variations. As a result of the rapid warming of annual minimum lake surface temperatures, some of the studied lakes no longer reach important minimum surface temperature thresholds that occur in winter, with complex and significant potential implications for lakes and the ecosystem services that they provide.

H.			Arctic lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) show evidence of seasonal acclimation of cardiac adrenergic sensitivity but not heat tolerance	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Many Arctic fishes experience prolonged periods of extreme cold and large thermal variation over both rapid and seasonal time scales which challenge critical physiological functions. In the central Canadian Arctic, we caught wild adult lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) acclimatized to winter and summer temperatures to determine the extent to which they seasonally adjust cardiac thermal performance and adrenergic control. We assessed the intrinsic and maximum heart rate (f(Hint) and f(Hmax)) of anaesthetised fish through cholinergic blockade and either adrenergic blockade (f(Hint)) or stimulation (f(Hmax)) during acute warming. Contrary to expectations, S. namaycush showed largely consistent heart rate responses to acute warming between seasons and adrenergic treatments. The f(Hmax) increased with acute warming and reached a peak (peak f(H)) of 83 and 93 beats min(-1) at temperatures (T-peak) of 19.6 and 20 degrees C and arrhythmia occurred at temperatures (T-arr) of 22.7 and 22.3 degrees C in winter and summer, respectively. However, in the winter, adrenergic stimulation was important to achieve peak f(H) at high temperatures; adrenergic blockade in winter did not affect T-peak (18.3 degrees C) or T-arr (21 degrees C) but lowered peak f(H) to only 68 beats min(-1) (p < 0.05). Despite limited seasonal differences in f(H), when compared at common, cool to moderate temperatures, winter acclimated fish did exhibit slower atrioventricular conduction (longer PR interval), slower ventricular depolarization (longer QRS duration) and a shorter overall systolic duration (lower QT interval). Overall, S. namaycush exhibited no seasonal plasticity in cardiac thermal tolerance and modest seasonal changes in adrenergic control at high temperatures and in cardiac electrical activity. This limited thermal plasticity may constrain their ability to cope with seasonally distinct thermal challenges including extreme heat events and increase their reliance on other coping or avoidance mechanisms when thermal refugia are available (e.g. behavioural thermoregulation). An increased need for avoidance behaviour could limit the accessibility of key habit for foraging and spawning which occurs in late summer in this region (Dubos et al., 2024).																				1095-8649				2025 SEP 6	2025										10.1111/jfb.70206	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.70206		SEP 2025						40913490					WOS:001567117300001

Population estimates for the 1972 year class were 0.052/ha in Oct. 1972 and 0.039/ha in March 1973. Estimates for the 1973 year class were 134.7/ha in June 1973, 92.2/ha in Sept. 1973, and 56.5/ha in May 1974. Daily instantaneous mortality rates for the 1973 year class were 0.003 between June and Sept. 1973, and 0.002 between Sept. 1973 and mid-May 1974. Mean annual increases in length and weight during the 1st growing season were 143 mm and 29 g for fish of the 1972 year class and 189 mm and 99g for the 1973 year class. Estimated standing crops at the end of the 1st growing season were about 0.002 kg/ha for the 1972 year class and 7.10 kg/ha for the 1973 year class. Net production and mortality could not be estimated for the 1972 year class. Net production for the 1973 year class was 0.007 kg/ha per day through fall 1973 and 0.002 kg/ha per day through spring 1974. Differences between numbers and mean growth rate between the 2 year classes were attributed to higher water levels during the spring and summer of 1973 after a prolonged (12 yr) period of low water levels.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1977	106	6					590	595		10.1577/1548-8659(1977)106<590:GPAMOL>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1977)106<590:GPAMOL>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1977EF41500011

Quartz content is very useful as a proxy record for reconstructing aeolian dust changes, influenced by paleointensity of the Asian winter monsoon and the Westerlies since the last glacial. On the other hand, total organic carbon (TOC) and Opal-A contents are useful as a proxy record for reconstructing primary biological production by paleo-precipitation, influenced by paleointensity of the Asian summer monsoon activities. Aeolian dust and TOC records in BIW95-4 core indicated the millennial-scale variation of the Asian winter and summer monsoon activities and the Westerlies during the last 40 ka, suggesting good correlations with global cooling events in the last glacial period found in the North Atlantic region. The Asian summer monsoon activities during the Holocene are frequent and increased at 9, 6, after 2 ka, and decreased at 4 ka. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

The great Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) at lower lake Constance/Germany: dietary composition and impact on commercial fisheries	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												At lower lake Constance, the number of cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo) has greatly increased during the last 15 years. An investigation of their diet can help to estimate the impact on fish and fisheries. Therefore, 282 cormorants were collected for stomach content analysis in autumn/winter 2011/12 and 2012/13. A total of 4019 fish or hard parts of 16 species were identified in the diet of cormorants. Fish length and weight were reconstructed from dimensions of hard parts using regression equations. Perch was the most frequent species (composition by number = 41.5%). Based on composition by weight, the most important species in the diet of cormorants was tench (Tinca tinca) with 47.0%, followed by Northern pike (Esox lucius), perch (Perca fluviatilis) and European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) with 23.9%, 7.2% and 6.9%, respectively. The dietary composition significantly differed between autumn and winter. Fish of high commercial value played a considerable part in the cormorants' diet. The impact of cormorants on grayling (Thymallus thymallus) could not be assessed due to the low number of birds from the spawning grounds of grayling at the outlet of lower lake Constance.																			1961-9502						2014		414							04	10.1051/kmae/2014015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/kmae/2014015													WOS:000345773200004

UAV-based imagery has proven effective in capturing detailed features of water bodies, making it a popular tool for water quality assessments. However, few studies have specifically focused on drone-based water quality monitoring in rural wetlands and their seasonal variations. In this study, Xiangfudang Rural Wetland Park, Jiaxin City, Zhejiang Province, China, was taken as the study area to evaluate water quality parameters, including total nitrogen (TN), total phosphors (TP), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and turbidity degree (TUB). We assessed these parameters across summer and winter seasons using UAV multispectral imagery and field sample data. Four machine learning algorithms were evaluated and compared for the inversion of the water quality parameters, based on the situ sample survey data and UAV multispectral images. The results show that ANN algorithm yielded the best results for estimating TN, COD, and TUB, with validation R2 of 0.78, 0.76, and 0.57, respectively; CatBoost performed best in TP estimation, with validation R2 and RMSE values of 0.72 and 0.05 mg/L. Based on spatial estimation results, the average COD concentration in the water body was 16.05 +/- 9.87 mg/L in summer, higher than it was in winter (13.02 +/- 8.22 mg/L). Additionally, mean TUB values were 18.39 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) in summer and 20.03 NTU in winter. This study demonstrates the novelty and effectiveness of using UAV multispectral imagery for water quality monitoring in rural wetlands, providing critical insights into seasonal water quality variations in these areas.																				2073-4441				NOV	2024	16	22							3163	10.3390/w16223163	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16223163													WOS:001366383700001

The biomass was highest in 1981 (max. 115 g ash-free dry weight m-2). The 1978 growth trend was similar to that of 1981 with slightly lower net annual production (max. 92 g AFDW m-2). The vegetation almost disappeared in 1979 (max. 24 g AFDW m-2). These large differences in biomass could not be explained by differences in insolation but were mainly attributed to the severe winter of 1978-''79 which slowed plant development and full maturity was attained only after the diurnal insolation had decreased. Reserve carbohydrates were primarily starch and water-soluble sugars. Starch concentrations varied between 71.5 and 24.7 mg g-1 AFDW in the winter and summer, and total sugar concentrations between 24.9 and 20.2 mg g-1 AFDW, respectively. The non-reducing sugars tended to predominate in summer and the reducing sugars in winter. The value of these reserves for maintenance, growth and survival was assessed by calculating plant carbon budgets for several seasons. It was concluded that C. demersum relies heavily on its developmental timing and energy-conserving physiological mechanisms to survive extended periods of stress and the these respects is analogous to a typical terrestrial shade plant.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY 30	1987	148	3					231	243		10.1007/BF00017526	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00017526													WOS:A1987H818100003

For the period, 39 common phytoplankton species accounted for 96.0% of the total abundance and 85.6% of the biomass. Over the 10-year study, the lake-wide average spring and summer phytoplankton biomass in the pelagic waters ranged from 0.27 to 1.2 g/m(3) (mean. +/- S.E. = 0.54 +/- 0.03 g/m3) and phytoplankton abundance ranged from 5,132 to 39,780 cells/mL (mean +/- S.E. = 18,291 +/- 822 cells/mL). Mesotrophic diatoms accounted for 47.2% of the total phytoplankton biomass. The lack of a trend in the ratio of mesotrophic to eutrophic diatom indicator species suggested that no change in trophic status of the pelagic region occurred during the 1983 to 92 period; that is, the water quality of the offshore of Lake Michigan did not change. A year-to-year shift in dominance from one mesotrophic diatom species to another was evident. Over the 10-year period, flagellates accounted for 52.2% of the summer phytoplankton biomass. The data support the concept of a shift in summer species composition away from blue-green algae dominance to flagellates prior to 1982. However after 1987 the relative importance of the > 70 mu m size class increased to over 21% of the phytoplankton abundance in the spring and over 55% in the summer. In particular, the colonial blue-greens, Anacystis and Aphanothece, became substantially more prevalent during the summer, while the flagellates, Chromulina and Ochromonas, decreased in abundance. The changes in the relative abundance of phytoplankton size classes and species composition were examined to determine if they correlated with either the top-down mediated changes in the zooplankton community during the 1980s and 1990s or with any bottom-up variability in nutrient chemistry. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) suggested a significant portion of the variability of the spring and summer phytoplankton size classes from 1983-1992 (88.0% and 99.2%, respectively) was explained by environmental axis I. Primary determinants of relative abundance of phytoplankton size class included nutrients (silica, total phosphorus, and N:P ratio) and abundance of some species of zooplankton. Specifically, Diaptomus minutus, D. ashlandi, D. sicilis, and Daphnia galeata mendotae were inversely correlated with the 0 to 10 mu m size class, which we interpret as a grazing effect on phytoplankton size structure, and positively correlated with an increase in abundance of the > 70 mu m size class of phytoplankton. CCA suggested that top-down and bottom-up effects were affecting phytoplankton size composition and abundance simultaneously.																			0380-1330						1998	24	3					637	657		10.1016/S0380-1330(98)70851-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(98)70851-2													WOS:000076738000013

Thirty bullheads ( greater than or equal to age 3) were collected from Quantico embayment, near a Superfund site that released organochlorine contaminants; Neabsco Creek, a tributary with petroleum inputs from runoff and marinas; and Anacostia River (spring and fall), an urban tributary designated as a Chesapeake Bay region of concern, that was contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and organochlorine pesticides. Fish were collected from the Tuckahoe River, as a reference. Cytochrome P450 activity, bile PAH metabolites, and muscle organochlorine pesticide and PCB concentrations were measured in randomly selected individuals and sediment contaminants were analyzed. We found statistically significant differences in liver tumor prevalences: Anacostia (spring), 50%; Anacostia (fall), 60%; Neabsco, 17%; Quantico, 7%; and Tuckahoe, 10%. Skin tumor prevalences were significantly different: Anacostia (spring), 37%; Anacostia (fall), 10%; Neabbco, 3%; Quantico, 3% and Tuckahoe, 0%. Tumor prevalence in Anacostia bullheads warrants concern and was similar to those at highly contaminated sited, in the Great Lakes, Evidence was found of higher PAH exposure in Anacostia fish but a cause-effect linkage could not be established.

Dual fuels: intra-annual variation in the relative importance of benthic and pelagic resources to maintenance, growth and reproduction in a generalist salmonid fish	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												Ecological systems are often characterized as stable entities. However, basal productivity in most ecosystems varies between seasons, particularly in subarctic and polar areas. How this variability affects higher trophic levels or entire food webs remains largely unknown, especially in these high-latitude regions. We undertook a year-long study of benthic (macroinvertebrate) and pelagic (zooplankton) resource availability, along with short (day/days: stomach content)-, medium (month: liver C-13 and N-15 isotopes)- and long-term (season: muscle C-13 and N-15 isotopes) assessments of resource use by a generalist fish, the European whitefish, in a deep, oligotrophic, subarctic lake in northern Europe. Due to the long ice-covered winter period, we expected to find general benthic reliance throughout the year, but also a seasonal importance of zooplankton to the diet, somatic growth and gonadal development of whitefish. Benthic and pelagic resource availability varied between seasons: peak littoral benthic macroinvertebrate density occurred in mid-winter, whereas maximum zooplankton density was observed in summer. Whitefish stomach content revealed a reliance on benthic prey items during winter and pelagic prey in summer. A seasonal shift from benthic to pelagic prey was evident in liver isotope ratios, but muscle isotope ratios indicated a year-round reliance on benthic macroinvertebrates. Whitefish activity levels as well as somatic and gonadal growth all peaked during the summer, coinciding with the zooplankton peak and the warmest water temperature. Stable isotopes of muscle consistently depicted the most important resource, benthic macroinvertebrates, whereas short-term indicators, that is, diet and stable isotopes of liver, revealed the seasonal significance of pelagic zooplankton for somatic growth and gonad development. Seasonal variability in resource availability strongly influences consumer growth and reproduction and may also be important in other ecosystems facing pronounced annual weather fluctuations.					; Harrod, Chris/A-8830-2008	Kahilainen, Kimmo/0000-0002-1539-014X; Harrod, Chris/0000-0002-5353-1556													0021-8790	1365-2656				NOV	2014	83	6					1501	1512		10.1111/1365-2656.12233	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12233								24738779					WOS:000344339500026
J	BURKHOLDER, JM; SHEATH, RG				BURKHOLDER, JM; SHEATH, RG			THE SEASONAL DISTRIBUTION, ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF DESMIDS (CHLOROPHYTA) IN A SOFTWATER, NORTH TEMPERATE STREAM	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												Suspended and benthic algal communities from a mildly acidic, 3rd-order Rhode Island (USA) stream were examined to determine the seasonal distribution, abundance and diversity of the lotic desmids. Within a 1-yr sampling period, 148 spp. and 202 subspecific taxa of desmids were identified, representing 23 genera. Species of Cosmarium and Closterium accounted for approximately 70% of the desmids present, and were the most diverse and abundant taxa during all seasons except spring, when Hyalotheca dissiliens was the dominant desmid species. Average abundance and species richness generally were greatest during summer for both suspended and benthic desmids. Most desmids occurred in benthic habitats, and were randomly distributed among substrata. Average seasonal abundance was 7.4 .times. 104 cells .cntdot. g-1 dry wt substratum, among 13 types of substrata. Highest desmid abundance was measured among substrata with intricate morphologies, such as Fontinalis spp., wich was associated with 1.2 .times. 106 desmid cells .cntdot. g-1 dry wt substratum, or 1.7 .times. 103 cells .cntdot. cm-2 substratum. Cell division was observed for 70 desmid taxa, and average seasonal reproduction (based on cell numbers) among all substrata ranged from 4% in winter to 20% during summer. In addition, sexually produced zygospores were found occasionally for H. dissiliens. Desmids were distributed among most substrata examined in this stream, with abundance comparable to reported estimates from softwater lakes and acid bogs. In contrast to established dogma, lotic desmids are not incidental drift organisms, but rather comprise a viable and persistent component of the stream periphyton.																			0022-3646	1529-8817					1984	20	2					159	172		10.1111/j.0022-3646.1984.00159.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-3646.1984.00159.x													WOS:A1984SY05800001

The present paper has demonstrated the different food-web responses to teleconnection indices, which are proxy of climate fluctuations, in lakes characterised by different trophic levels. We analysed an 18-year long-term dataset (1998-2015) recorded in the deep eutrophic Lake Iseo and we compared our results to those concerning deep southern-Alpine oligotrophic lakes. Our results confirmed that winter large-scale circulation patterns (for Mediterranean area: East Atlantic Pattern and Eastern Mediterranean Pattern) control a chain of linked causal factors, affecting the winter air temperature, spring water temperature, the resulting water vertical-mixing depth and epilimnetic concentration of total phosphorus. We highlighted that in a lake, characterised by high phosphorus concentration, the spring enrichment in nutrients did not result in either a considerable increase of phytoplankton growth, nor, consequently, in a zooplankton density peak. Whereas in oligotrophic lakes, cascading effects influenced the algal carrying capacity and Daphnia population density. We observed that climatic fluctuations, mediated by, for example, colder water temperature in spring, postponed the timing of population recovery after diapause of both primary consumers (Daphnia and Eubosmina) and secondary consumers (Bythotrephes and Leptodora). The latter being verified for the first time in a eutrophic lake.					; Nava, Veronica/E-6989-2018; Nava, Veronica/LDG-5826-2024	LEONI, BARBARA/0000-0001-9448-9457; Nava, Veronica/0000-0002-2770-1937; 													1323-1650	1448-6059					2018	69	10					1534	1543		10.1071/MF17243	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF17243													WOS:000445239400006

Combustion characteristics of reed and its suitability as a boiler fuel	MIRES AND PEAT												In recent years, common reed (Phragmites australis) has become a conservation problem in Estonia because it has spread into ecologically valuable habitats, out-competing other species and impacting on biodiversity values. Thus, the use of common reed as a biomass fuel may not only provide renewable energy, but also help in biodiversity conservation efforts. The properties of reed as a potential biofuel must be studied because the fuel handling method, the lifetime of combustion equipment (fouling, erosion and corrosion), combustion regimes and environmental impacts such as pollution, ash handling etc. depend on these properties. The combustion characteristics of reed vary to some extent depending both on the site where it grows (coastal area, lake, river delta or wetland treatment system) and seasonally (winter or summer harvesting). This paper presents the results of tests on reed properties including the chemical composition of summer and winter harvested reed and its ash, ash fusibility temperature, physical properties such as moisture and ash proportions, dry bulk density, calorific value and energy density. The impacts of different chemical and physical properties of reed on boiler operation are discussed.

Total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll a (Chl-a), and total suspended matter (TSM) are important indexes of water quality and important factors influencing eutrophication and algal blooms. In this study, remote sensing was used to monitor these indexes to investigate the effects of river discharge on the estuary of Taihu Lake by the largest inflow river which is Chendong River using a total of 136 Geostationary Ocean Color Images (GOCI). In situ datasets collected during the four cruise experiments on Taihu Lake between 2011 and 2015 were used to develop the TP, Chl-a, and TSM inversion models based on simple empirical algorithms: 154 points for TP (mg/L), 114 for Chl-a (mu g/L), and 181 for TSM (mg/L). The spatial and temporal changes of the concentration of the three parameters in the Chendong River estuary were analyzed by combining the GOCI data, the flow of the Chendong River, and meteorological data throughout the year in 2014. The several key findings are as follows: (1) In summer and autumn, TP, Chl-a, and TSM contents were significantly higher than in winter and spring. TP and Chl-a have a few similar distribution characteristics. And organic suspended matter in summer was the main reason for the increase of the TSM concentration. (2) The severe surface erosion in the rivers cannot be ignored; the high erodibility is an important factor in the increase of TP and TSM concentrations in the estuary. The concentration of the water quality parameter showed exponential decay with distance from the shore. The concentration decreased slowly after 12 km and then remained essentially constant. (3) TP content in the Chendong River estuary decreased under steady flow inputs and dramatically increased when the flow became large. The increase in Chl-a content was linked to higher levels of TP and good weather conditions after the rain event. Higher flow rates mainly play a dilution role for the Chl-a concentration. Erosion of the surface soil via rainfall is a major source of TSM to the estuary. This paper firstly analyzes tempo-spatial dynamics of water quality and its response to river flow in estuary of Taihu Lake, helps to further understand the impact of river input on lake water quality, and is important for lake eutrophication.

In this study, we presented information on the occurrence of 5 triazine pesticides (TRIs) and 3 neonicotine pesticides (NEOs) detected in water samples of Qilu Lake Basin in China. We identified the unusual occupational exposure scenarios as (i) adult females washing the harvested vegetables, and (ii) adult males catching fish in Qilu Lake; next, the health risk assessment was conducted using collected data. The results showed that the mean sigma 5 TRI concentrations ranged from 505.87 ng/L in spring to 864.04 ng/L in summer, and the river water samples around Qilu Lake had the highest concentrations. The mean concentrations of sigma 3 NEOs ranged from 885.86 ng/L in winter to 2593.04 ng/L in summer. Occupational exposed populations were bearing one to two orders of magnitude higher exposure doses than local adults. Although the carcinogenic risks caused by atrazine in water were at acceptable levels for local residents, all the occupational exposed males were at moderate risks, and 15.78 %-43.50 % of occupational exposed females in different seasons were even at high risks. The non-carcinogenic risks caused by pesticides in water were all at negligible levels, but the occupational exposed population were facing up to two orders of magnitude higher risks than local residents. This study established a sound basis for further decision-making to take necessary action on protection of sensitive population groups.

The community grazing rate calculated with the use of two empirical models, and based on herbivorous crustaceans, peaked in spring and early autumn up to 150.6% of water filtered per day, and was the lowest during winter. Simple statistics revealed a positive correlation between zooplankton biomass and chlorophyll a concentration (r = 0.404, P = 0.033) and between zooplankton abundance and phytoplankton biomass (r = 0.42, P = 0.028). Canonical statistics indicated, however, that the relationship exists only with size groups and/or living forms of a few taxonomical groups of phytoplankton. Redundancy analysis (RDA) confirmed a positive influence of the community grazing rate on micro- and nanoplanktonic Cryptophyceae, but not on the microplanktonic Cyanobacteria, as was suggested by canonical correlation analysis. RDA also indicated a weak negative influence on nanoplanktonic Euglenophyceae and Chlorophyceae exerted by filtering crustaceans. Some taxonomically diverse flagellated nanoplanktonic algae were grazing sensitive, whereas microplanktonic cryptophytes and coenobial green algae were significantly grazing resistant.					; Gołdyn, Ryszard/J-1093-2018	Goldyn, Ryszard/0000-0001-8325-5161; Kowalczewska-Madura, Katarzyna/0000-0003-0243-1085; 													0142-7873	1464-3774				JAN	2008	30	1					33	42		10.1093/plankt/fbm086	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbm086													WOS:000253491400004

We studied epilithic diatom assemblages from the shallow margins of 19 lakes from three areas (coast-inland-ice sheet margin) along a climate gradient in Kangerlussuaq, West Greenland during two periods; shortly after ice-off (spring) and in the middle of the growth season (summer). We aimed to understand the distribution of Arctic epilithic diatoms in relation to water chemistry gradients during the two seasons, to investigate their incorporation into lake sediments and to assess their applicability as palaeoenvironmental indicators. Diatoms were correlated with nutrients in the spring and alkalinity/major ions in the summer, when nutrients were depleted; approximately half of the variance explained was independent of spatial factors. When categorised by functional attributes, diatom seasonal succession differed among regions with the most obvious changes in inland lakes where summer temperatures are warmer, organic nutrient processing is prevalent and silicate is limiting. These conditions led to small, motile and adnate diatoms being abundant in inland lakes during the summer (Nitzschia spp., Encyonopsis microcephala), as these functional attributes are suited to living within complex mats of non-siliceous microbial biofilms. Seasonal succession in silica-rich lakes at the coast was less pronounced and assemblages included Tabellaria flocculosa (indicating more acidic conditions) and Hannaea arcus (indicating input from inflowing rivers). The nitrogen-fixing diatom Epithemia sorex increased from the coast to the ice sheet, negatively correlating with a gradient of reactive nitrogen. The presence of this diatom in Holocene sediment records alongside cyanobacterial carotenoids during arid periods of low nitrogen delivery, suggests that it is a useful indicator of nitrogen limitation. Nitzschia species appear to be associated with high concentrations of organic carbon and heterotrophy, but their poor representation in West Greenland lake sediments due to taphonomic processes limits their palaeoenvironmental application in this region. Proportions of epilithic taxa in lake sediment records of coastal lakes increased during some wetter periods of the Holocene, suggesting that snowpack-derived nutrient delivery may offer diatom taxa living at lake margins a competitive advantage over planktonic diatoms during the "moating" ice melt period. Thus, further research investigating linkages between epilithic diatoms, snowpack and nutrient delivery in seasonally frozen lakes is recommended as these taxa live on the 'front-line' during the spring and may be especially sensitive to changes in snowmelt conditions.

Extreme warming and regime shift toward amplified variability in a far northern lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Mean annual air temperatures in the High Arctic are rising rapidly, with extreme warming events becoming increasingly common. Little is known, however, about the consequences of such events on the ice-capped lakes that occur abundantly across this region. Here, we compared 2 years of high-frequency monitoring data in Ward Hunt Lake in the Canadian High Arctic. One of the years included a period of anomalously warm conditions that allowed us to address the question of how loss of multi-year ice cover affects the limnological properties of polar lakes. A mooring installed at the deepest point of the lake (9.7 m) recorded temperature, oxygen, chlorophylla(Chla) fluorescence, and underwater irradiance from July 2016 to July 2018, and an automated camera documented changes in ice cover. The complete loss of ice cover in summer 2016 resulted in full wind exposure and complete mixing of the water column. This mixing caused ventilation of lake water heat to the atmosphere and 4 degrees C lower water temperatures than under ice-covered conditions. There were also high values of Chlafluorescence, elevated turbidity levels and large oxygen fluctuations throughout fall and winter. During the subsequent summer, the lake retained its ice cover and the water column remained stratified, with lower Chlafluorescence and anoxic bottom waters. Extreme warming events are likely to shift polar lakes that were formerly capped by continuous thick ice to a regime of irregular ice loss and unstable limnological conditions that vary greatly from year to year.

J	CHOULIK, O; MOORE, TR				CHOULIK, O; MOORE, TR			RESPONSE OF A SUB-ARCTIC LAKE CHAIN TO REDUCED SEWAGE LOADING	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Changes in total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll a (Chl a), and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations were monitored in a lake chain in northern Quebec to which sewage loading had been reduced by about 80% over 8 yr. Summer concentrations of TP and Chl a fell by 70 and 78%, respectively, in Lake Pearce, the uppermost lake most affected by eutrophication. Reductions in the two downstream lakes were 64 and 55% for TP and 45% for Chl a. The rapid response of the lakes to reduced sewage loading is related to the short residence time of water (60 d in winter to 2 d during snowmelt in Lake Pearce). Sediments in Lake Pearce showed thick (20-70 cm) accumulations of soft, organic-rich material (loss on ignition 10-50%), containing 4-20 mg P.g-1; however, winter P release rates were small (about 0.2 mg P.m-2.d-1), possibly associated with the Fe-rich nature of the sediments. Although anoxic conditions still develop under the thick ice cover (1 m), the depth and intensity are less than before sewage reduction. Reductions in TP have been accompanied by increases in TN and TN:TP ratios (from <10:1 to >30:1), suggesting that there has been a shift from N to P limitation.																			0706-652X					JUN	1992	49	6					1236	1245		10.1139/f92-139	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f92-139													WOS:A1992HY49300020

The annual mean of PM(2.5)was highest at the urban site and lowest at the rural site, with an average of 51.5 +/- 48.9 and 26.4 +/- 17.8 mu g center dot m(-3), respectively. The average PM(2.5)concentration of the industrial and suburban sites was 42.8 +/- 27.4 and 37.2 +/- 23.7 mu g center dot m(-3), respectively. All sites except for the rural had concentrations above the ambient air quality standards of China (GB3095-2012). The highest concentration of PM(2.5)at all sites was observed in winter, followed by spring, autumn, and summer. The concentration of major constituents showed statistically significant seasonal and spatial variation. The highest concentrations of organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), and water-soluble inorganic ions (WSIIs) were found at the urban site in winter. The average concentration of F(-)was higher than that in many studies, especially at the industrial site where the annual average concentration of F(-)was 1.5 +/- 1.7 mu g center dot m(-3). The range of sulfur oxidation ratio (SOR) was 0.1-0.18 and nitrogen oxidation ratio (NOR) was 0.02-0.1 in Xining. The higher SO42-/NO(3)(-)indicates that coal combustion has greater impact than vehicle emissions. The results of the potential source contribution function (PSCF) suggest that air mass from middle- and large-scale transport from the western areas of Xining have contributed to the higher level of PM2.5. On the basis of the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model, it was found that aerosols from salt lakes and dust were the main sources of PM(2.5)in Xining, accounting for 26.3% of aerosol total mass. During the sandstorms, the concentration of PM(2.5)increased sharply, and the concentrations of Na+, Ca(2+)and Mg(2+)were 1.13-2.70, 1.68-4.41, and 1.15-5.12 times higher, respectively, than annual average concentration, implying that aerosols were mainly from dust and the largest saltwater lake, Qinghai Lake, and many other salt lakes in the province of Qinghai. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) was utilized to study the surface components of PM(2.5)and F(-)was found to be increasingly distributed from the surface to inside the particles. We determined that the extremely high PM(2.5)concentration appears to be due to an episode of heavy pollution resulting from the combination of sandstorms and the burning of fireworks.																				2073-4433				SEP	2020	11	9							953	10.3390/atmos11090953	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos11090953													WOS:000580125700001

The physical model was the Princeton ocean model (POM) driven directly by observed winds and net surface heat flux. The biological model was an eight-component, phosphorus-limited, lower trophic level food web model, which included phosphate and silicate for nutrients, diatoms and non-diatoms for dominant phytoplankton species, copepods and protozoa for dominant zooplankton species, bacteria and detritus. Driven by observed meteorological forcings, a 1-D modeling experiment showed a controlling of physical processes on the seasonal variation of biological variables in Lake Michigan: diatoms grew significantly in the subsurface region in early summer as stratification developed and then decayed rapidly in the surface mixed layer when silicate supplied from the deep stratified region was reduced as a result of the formation of the thermocline. The non-diatoms subsequently grew in mid and late summer under a limited-phosphate environment and then declined in the fall and winter as a result of the nutrient consumption in the upper eutrophic layer, limitation of nutrients supplied from the deep region and meteorological cooling and wind mixing. The flux estimates suggested that the microbial loop had a significant contribution in the growth of microzooplankton and hence, to the lower-trophic level food web system. The model results agreed with observations, suggesting that the model was robust to capture the basic seasonal variation of the ecosystem in Lake Michigan.

Consequently, spatial complexity of the landscape is less emphasised. Our study addresses this knowledge gap. The field study taken in West Pomeranian Lake District in Poland during four campaigns (spring and autumn) revealed that the mosaic of fields (MF) supported higher earthworm abundance than the similarly managed but homogeneous field (HF). Number and biomass of earthworm individuals both reflect the relationships with electrical conductivity, pH and in some situations also soil organic carbon and soil moisture effectively. We argue that autumn sampling is more preferable for biomonitoring.					; Regulska, Edyta/IWV-3346-2023	Kolaczkowska, Ewa/0000-0001-9553-7350; Regulska, Edyta/0000-0003-0386-3306													0016-7282	2300-7362					2016	89	3					311	322		10.7163/GPol.0061	http://dx.doi.org/10.7163/GPol.0061													WOS:000409951000003

Seasonal natural and fishing mortality of striped bass in a southeastern reservoir	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Reliable estimates of natural and fishing mortality are important for management of exploited fish populations, but these components of the total mortality rate can be difficult to determine by traditional fisheries methods. We used telemetry data to determine seasonal instantaneous fishing (F) and natural mortality (M) rates of subadult and adult striped bass Morone saxatilis in Badin Lake, North Carolina. Our analyses were based on the fates of 64 fish implanted with sonic transmitters and released and tracked for 2 years. Natural mortality was low and constant during the course of the study (M +/- SE = 0.10 +/- 0.01) and was similar to estimates for other reservoir populations of striped bass. A natural mortality rate of 0.09-0.16 may be a reasonable approximation for populations across the southeastern United States. Fishing mortality varied seasonally and was highest in the spring and summer of 2002 and the summer and fall of 2003: annual fishing mortality (F +/- SE) was 0.65 +/- 0.08 in 2002 and 0.77 +/- 0.08 in 2003. Due to these high harvest rates, estimated annual survival rates were low for the Badin Lake population (47% in 2002; 42% in 2003). Results of a yield-per-recruit model suggest that harvest of older, larger individuals can be increased in Badin Lake with a decrease in fishing mortality or a moderate increase in the minimum size limit, even when the effect of catch-and-release mortality of fish below the size limit is considered. Our results also indicate important considerations for researchers using this method in the future, including the need to estimate downstream emigration and delay the inclusion of newly tagged fish in analysis to avoid biasing estimates of fishing mortality.

Measured shoal dimensions spread over a wide range, but the frequency distributions were strongly and consistently skewed towards smaller sizes. After applying corrections for beam width and pulse length, the median values for shoal width and shoal height were 16.7 m and 3.0 m, respectively. Therefore, nearly all shoals were horizontally elongated and the median value for the width to height ratio was 5.2 A correction for the bias introduced by the fact that shoal widths may be sampled at an off-center position resulted in a median value of 23.2 m for the total observed shoal widths. Significant seasonal dependencies have been found for shoal depth and shoal frequency (the ratio of the number of observed shoals to the travelled distance), but not for any dimension. In winter, shoals stayed at greater depths than during the rest of the year. Shoal frequencies ranged between 0.7 and 2.7 km(-1), and were lower during summer and fall.																			0071-1128		3-510-47052-4				1998	50						237	248																WOS:000078180200024

It examines the relationship between water and sediment quality parameters, and assesses the factors affecting eutrophication. Water and sediment quality are examined at 8 stations in the lake between May 2008, and May 2009. Water and sediment quality parameters measured are T, pH, EC, SD, NH4-N, NO3-N, TN, PO4-P, TP. Also DO, alkalinity, hardness, SS, BOD, COD, Chl-a parameters in water and organic matter content in sediment are measured. SS, Chl-a, TP concentrations showed their maximum value in the summer (122.75 mg L-1, 43.87 mg m(-3) and 0.48 mg L-1 respectively), and their minimum value during winter (12 mg L-1, 6.80 mg m(-3), 0.076 mg L-1 respectively). TN indicated a maximum concentration in summer (23.23 mg L-1) and a minimum during spring (3.89 mg L-1). This study reveals the importance of relationships between temperature DO and nutrients in water. Effect of pH, relation of temperature, conductivity with all nutrients in the sediment, and the differences between the seasons are designated as statistically significant. Water pollution has measured extremely high in station 8 according to Chl-a, BOD and COD parameters, and station 1 indicates the same situation with respect to nitrogen parameters. The results revealed the importance and the need for strict control of point and non-point pollution loads for the preservation of the Uluabat Lake's water quality. Compliance requirements should be set up for activities that could adversely affect water quality.

Numerical modeling of vertical stratification of Lake Shira in summer	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												A one-dimensional numerical model and a two-dimensional numerical model of the hydrodynamic and thermal structure of Lake Shira during summer have been developed, with several original physical and numerical features. These models are well suited to simulate the formation and dynamics of vertical stratification and provide a basis for an ecological water-quality model of the lake. They allow for the quantification of the vertical mixing processes that govern not only the thermal structure but also the nutrient exchange, and more generally, the exchange of dissolved and particulate matter between different parts of the lake. The outcome of the calculations has been compared with the field data on vertical temperature and salinity distributions in Lake Shira. Lake Shira is meromictic and exhibits very stable annual stratification. The stratification is so stable because of the high salinity of the water. If the water in Lake Shira were fresh and other parameters (depth, volume, and meteorology) were the same, as now, the lake would be mixed in autumn. Using the newly developed models and using common meteorological parameters, we conclude that Lake Shira will remain stratified in autumn as long as the average salinity is higher than 3%.					; Mooij, Wolf/C-2677-2008; Genova, Svetlana/B-3287-2013	Belolipetskii, Victor/0000-0002-4909-7857; Mooij, Wolf/0000-0001-5586-8200; Genova, Svetlana N/0000-0002-6220-5277; 													1386-2588	1573-5125				SEP	2010	44	3					561	570		10.1007/s10452-010-9330-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-010-9330-z													WOS:000285338600008

Considerable biosignatures were present in summer DOM, yet with a near absence of algal extract compounds. Extensive molecular alteration resulting from multistep and massively parallel biotic and subordinated abiotic transformations of algal biomass to DOM included loss and synthesis of carbohydrates, fundamental changes of aromatic compounds and progressive formation of carboxyl-rich alicyclic compounds (CRAM). The DOM transformation from summer to fall resulted in smaller molecules, increased abundance of CHNO continuous molecular series and overall molecular diversity. Analysis of MS-derived compositional networks placed summer DOM in-between the algal extract and fall DOM. Metabolic pathway annotation by means of high-resolution mass analysis provided a wide range of pathways associated with secondary metabolites in DOM and more basic ones like carbohydrate metabolism characteristic of algal extract compounds. Overall, the time-dependent molecular signature of Taihu DOM was likely dominated by microbial metabolism rather than abiotic chemical transformations. Results from this study indicate that high-resolution organic structural spectroscopy resolves meaningful structural detail out of complex environmental mixtures and has the potential to contribute significantly to future functional biodiversity studies.

This study investigates the oxidative stress response of Cottus gobio in a high-mountain lake (Dimon Lake) located in the northeast Italy during the ice-free season, focusing on the relationship between oxidative stress biomarkers and physicochemical water parameters, as well as persistent and emerging contaminants. Significant seasonal variations were observed in water parameters, with lower oxygen, pH, conductivity, and phosphate levels in summer compared to autumn, while temperature, ammonium, and nitrate were higher in summer. Metal concentrations in C. gobio muscle were higher in autumn, with Zn showing the most significant increase. PAHs, NDL-PCBs, and pesticides were all below the limit of quantification in the fish muscle samples. No microplastics items were found in the gastrointestinal tracts of fish. Oxidative stress biomarkers revealed organ-specific and seasonal variations. The liver exhibited the highest activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione S-tranferase (GST), and glutathione reductase (GR), highlighting its central role in detoxification and metabolic processes. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was notably higher in muscle tissue during summer, suggesting increased metabolic activity. A strong correlation was found between pH and the activities of SOD, CAT, GPx, GR, and metallothioneins (MTs), emphasizing the importance of water chemistry in influencing oxidative stress responses. This approach not only aids in understanding the local adaptations of these fish but also highlights the impacts of environmental stressors on highmountain ecosystems.

Evaluating per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) prevalence and potential for biological effects in Lake Superior tributaries	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Several per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are Great Lakes binational chemicals of mutual concern. Although known to be persistent, data gaps regarding PFAS prevalence and biological effects exist, especially within Lake Superior's watershed. In this 2022 study of 27 United States tributaries to Lake Superior, water samples were collected during spring runoff, summer baseflow, and fall baseflow, and streambed-sediment samples were collected during fall. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) were detected in 97% of water samples and 59% of sediment samples. Summed PFAS water sample concentrations (33 analytes) were generally low, relative to other environmental studies (median = 6.5 ng/L), except at Newton, Miller, and Sargent Creeks (up to 391 ng/L). Maximum water concentrations were from perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS); perfluorobutanoic acid had the greatest median concentration. Perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were most frequently detected in water samples (>90%). Summed PFAS sediment sample concentrations (33 analytes) were also generally low (median = 19 ng/kg), except at Newton and Muggun Creeks (up to 797 ng/kg). In sediment, PFOS occurred most frequently and had the greatest concentrations. The most contaminated samples came from sites with documented aqueous film forming foam or wastewater contamination; summer baseflow samples exhibited elevated PFAS concentrations. Comparison of observed water concentrations to published and derived water-quality guidelines indicated PFOS and PFHxS pose the greatest potential ecological risks. Observed PFAS mixtures may affect lipid metabolism, growth, thyroid hormones, and survival of aquatic organisms. The observed concentrations and predicted biological effects are likely underestimates of the environmental impact of PFAS. Despite low anthropogenic influence in Lake Superior's watershed, PFAS were ubiquitous and occurred at potentially harmful concentrations.					; Remucal, Christina/B-8932-2009; Elliott, Sarah/LSL-8690-2024	Pronschinske, Matthew/0000-0001-9787-4545; 													0730-7268	1552-8618				JUN	2025	44	6					1723	1741		10.1093/etojnl/vgaf073	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/etojnl/vgaf073								40443096					WOS:001498937700026

Populations in newly sown pastures increased to a peak in the 2nd or 3rd autumn after sowing and then declined. Application of lindane at Tihoi in 1979 reduced grass grub numbers by an average of 84% in the year after treatment, but 3 of the 5 treated populations have since increased to higher levels than the untreated. A life table study of the 1981-1982 grass grub generation at Tihoi showed that variation in summer mortality was responsible for differences in population trend. Weather, pasture composition, grazing management, depletion of the food supply, and predation did not appear to be major causes of summer mortality. This mortality was not significantly related to population density on a continuous scale but was much lower in increasing populations than in populations which had declined for 1-3 generations after reaching a peak.																			0028-8233	1175-8775					1983	26	3					381	390		10.1080/00288233.1983.10427047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288233.1983.10427047													WOS:A1983RQ07700017

The total deposition fluxes varied from 4.74 to 27.0 ng/m(2)/day for PBDEs and 8.77 to 206 ng/m(2)/day for DPs, respectively. The fractions of anti-DP to the total DPs (f(anti)) varied from 0.28 to 0.63 (mean = 0.43 +/- 0.06), i.e., generally lower than those in commercial products, which might be attributed to the different environmental fates of the two isomers. Significant seasonal and spatial variations of PBDEs and DPs were observed. The deposition fluxes in summer were generally higher than those in winter, which may be due to the relatively high temperature and rainfall in summer under the influence of prevailing subtropical monsoon climate. Moreover, high deposition fluxes of PBDEs and DPs in urban areas and significant urban/rural gradient implied that local industrial activities in the urban areas were primary sources, which were further confirmed by the results of principal component analysis. The highest deposition of PBDE and DP fluxes was found at different sampling sites, suggesting PBDEs and DPs may be derived from different industries or products.

BENTHIC MACROINVERTEBRATE DIVERSITY AND WATER QUALITY BIOASSESSMENT OF THE CENTRAL LAKE IN QINGTONGXIA RESERVOIR WETLAND NATURE RESERVE, CHINA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The lake is a dynamic lentic ecosystem subject to different pressures that influence and compromise its ecological structure. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of using the benthic macroinvertebrate to assess the water quality. Ten sites were sampled in spring, summer and autumn in 2021. We collected 969 individuals of benthic macroinvertebrates belonging to 42 species and 22 families. Leander modestus (Palaemonidae) with 48.71%, followed by Radix ovata (Lymnaeidae) with 18.27% were the most abundant species and collected at all study sites in all seasons. We used biological indices, including Shannon index (H'), Pielou's evenness index (J) and biological monitoring working party (BMWP). This study showed H' scores ranged from 0.65 to 2.18, Pielou's evenness index ( J) scores fluctuated from 0.21 to 0.68 and BMWP values assessed ranging from 19 to 40. Our findings showed that the water quality of the Central Lake ranged from polluted to slightly impacted or "poor to good". Further water resource management and the pollution control should be a high priority to prevent benthic organisms in this lake.

Thermal springs issue in the mid-valley area along a 300-m lateral section of ash-flow tuff, and range in temperature from 21 to 29.8-degrees-C in early summer and from 15 to 17-degrees-C in mid-summer. Concentrations of major and minor chemical constituents in the thermal waters are nearly identical regardless of temperature. Waters in the downvalley parts of the rivers draining the 1921 deposits are mainly mixtures of cold meteoric waters and thermal waters of which the mid-valley thermal spring waters are representative. The weathering reactions of cold waters with the 1912 deposits appear to have stabilized and add only subordinate amounts of chemical constituents to the rivers relative to those contributed by the thermal waters. Isotopic data indicate that the mid-valley thermal spring waters are meteoric, but data is inconclusive regarding the heat source. The thermal waters could be either from a shallow part of a hydrothermal system beneath the 1912 vent region or from an incompletely cooled, welded tuff lens deep in the 1912 ash-flow sheet of the upper River Lethe area. Bicarbonate-sulfate waters resulting from interaction of near-surface waters and the cooling 1953-1968 southwest Trident plug issue from thermal springs south of Katmai Pass and near Mageik Creek, although the Mageik Creek spring waters are from a well-established, more deeply circulating hydrothermal system. Katmai caldera lake waters are a result of acid gases from vigorous drowned dissolving in lake waters composed of snowmelt and precipitation.																			0377-0273					FEB	1992	49	3-4					209	231		10.1016/0377-0273(92)90015-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0377-0273(92)90015-6													WOS:A1992HN50400003

Dissolved iron (Fe-d) ranged between 1 and 4 nM at offshore stations and > 10 nM at most nearshore sites. Iron availability was assessed using a luminescent Synechococcus bioreporter comprising a luciferase reporter controlled by an iron-responsive promoter isiAB. Bioreporter luminescence was negatively correlated to Fe-d measured in the samples. Distance from shore was a better predictor of iron bioavailability than was season. Water collected from most offshore stations sampled during spring and summer elicited higher bioreporter luminescence than did nearshore sites. Iron availability did not vary with depth during summer, despite the presence of elevated levels of Fe-d in the hypolimnion at most stations. Ultrafiltration (0.02 mu m) of Fe-d at two offshore sites demonstrated Fe-d to be present mainly in a colloidal phase, yet the bioreporter responded solely to iron contained in the soluble phase. During spring, a parallel immunochemical assay of diatoms resulted in the detection of ferredoxin (Fd) but not flavodoxin (Flvd) at five stations indicating the presence of an iron sufficient assemblage of diatoms at these sites. Whereas neither bioreporter nor immunochemical approaches conducted during spring supported physiological iron deficiency among Lake Superior phytoplankton, the results did point to differences in the availability of iron to prokaryotes and eukaryotes.					; Bullerjahn, George/F-4428-2010; McKay, Robert/P-3759-2017; Al-Rshaidat, Mamoon/C-6549-2015	Brown, Erik T/0000-0001-7154-2729; McKay, Robert/0000-0003-2723-5371; Sterner, Robert/0000-0003-2292-6122; Al-Rshaidat, Mamoon/0000-0003-3047-5608; Bullerjahn, George/0000-0001-5319-7896													0142-7873	1464-3774				OCT	2005	27	10					1033	1044		10.1093/plankt/fbi070	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbi070													WOS:000233990800007

Pilot- and bench-scale testing of faecal indicator bacteria survival in marine beach sand near point sources	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY												Factors affecting faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and pathogen survival/persistence in sand remain largely unstudied. This work elucidates how biological and physical factors affect die-off in beach sand following sewage spills. Solar disinfection with mechanical mixing was pilot-tested as a disinfection procedure after a large sewage spill in Los Angeles. Effects of solar exposure, mechanical mixing, predation and/or competition, season, and moisture were tested at bench scale. First-order decay constants for Escherichia coli ranged between -0.23 and -1.02 per day, and for enterococci between -0.5 and -1.0 per day. Desiccation was a dominant factor for E. coli but not enterococci inactivation. Effects of season were investigated through a comparison of experimental results from winter, spring, and fall. Moisture was the dominant factor controlling E. coli inactivation kinetics. Initial microbial community and sand temperature were also important factors. Mechanical mixing, common in beach grooming, did not consistently reduce bacterial levels. Inactivation rates are mainly dependent on moisture and high sand temperature. Chlorination was an effective disinfection treatment in sand microcosms inoculated with raw influent.

Diel Bacterioplankton Community Dynamics Under Contrasting Light Regimes	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY REPORTS												In the Boreal region, extreme seasonal variations in day-night length expose communities to dynamic light and temperature fluctuations. Freshwater bacterioplankton, representing key ecosystem components, faces climate-driven shifts; yet the fixed day-length patterns determined by latitude underscore the importance of studying light's role in predicting ecosystem responses. We investigated bacterial community composition in a brown peat bog and a clear oligotrophic lake across seasons with contrasting light regimes: the summer solstice (> 20 h of daylight) and the autumn equinox (equal day-night length). Using amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA transcripts, alongside measurements of physicochemical parameters, organic matter characterisation and dissolved carbon dioxide and methane gas measurements, we found no diel cycling in the lake during either period or in the peat bog near the summer solstice. However, the structure of bacterial peat bog communities exhibited cyclic changes over diel cycles at the autumn equinox. Twelve amplicon sequence variants, including both phototrophic and heterotrophic taxa, increased in abundance at all measured morning sampling times. These findings provide valuable insights into the diel patterns of boreal lentic habitats and their bacterioplankton communities, highlighting the absence of diel fluctuations in some systems and seasons, while revealing cyclic dynamics in others, driven by conditionally rare taxa.

This layering can be found in several lignite pit lakes, but mechanisms to explain it have not been investigated with respect to the specific hydrology and chemistry of acid pit lakes. The north basin of Lake 111 is flat-bottomed, dimictic, and bioturbation can be neglected. Physical and chemical characteristics, sedimentation rates and composition of settling material have been monitored over two years and large thin sections of sediment cores were analysed microscopically to identify fine sediment layering as annual. Total sedimentation rate was highest in winter, partly due to storms, while sedimentation of particulate organic matter showed peaks in May. Sedimentation of chrysophyte cysts occurred mainly in summer and autumn. Regular bands of chrysophyte cysts were detected, and comparison with the documented history of the lake substantiated that the observed lamination formed annually. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on varve formation in an extremely acidic lake which is not governed by fumaroles at the lake bottom.

The oxidation of organic C in the sediment by aerobic and nitrate respiration was 290 and 188 g C m-2 yr-1, respectively. During winter, nitrate respiration amounted to 94% of the total C oxidation; it was zero during summer. On an annual basis nitrate respiration constituted 39% of total respiration. Sediment nitrate uptake was correlated to nitrate concentration. The nitrate uptake rates varied during the year from zero in summer to 55 mg N m-2 day-1 in spring. O2 uptake rates varied from 30-250 mg O2 m-2 h-1 during the year, with a maximum uptake in Aug. The O2 uptake per year was calculated as 860 g O2 m-2. The O2 uptake rate was correlated to lake temperature and Kjeldahl N content of the sediment. The O2 uptake rate, however, showed no correlation with loss on ignition of the sediment. A Q10-value of 2.2 was found for lake measurements in the temperature interval of 5-15.degree. C. The corresponding Q10-value in the laboratory was 2.6. A high microbial biomass indicated by the maximum content of Kjeldahl N and the lowest ratio of loss on ignition on Kjeldahl N appeared in late Aug., when the maximum O2 uptake occurred. The O2 uptake rate increased during the time interval from sampling to the start of the experiments.																			0105-9327						1981	4	1					66	72																WOS:A1981LD66800009

One of the most invasive species in Patagonia's freshwater systems and elsewhere is rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). This species was introduced to Chile during the early twentieth century for stocking and promoting recreational fishing; during the late twentieth century was reintroduced for farming purposes and is now naturalized. We used population-and individual-based inference from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to illuminate three objectives related to the establishment and naturalization of Rainbow Trout in Lake Llanquihue. This lake has been intensively used for trout farming during the last three decades. Our results emanate from samples collected from five inlet streams over two seasons, winter and spring. First, we found that significant intra- population (temporal) genetic variance was greater than inter-population (spatial) genetic variance, downplaying the importance of spatial divergence during the process of naturalization. Allele frequency differences between cohorts, consistent with variation in fish length between spring and winter collections, might explain temporal genetic differences. Second, individual-based Bayesian clustering suggested that genetic structure within Lake Llanquihue was largely driven by putative farm propagules found at one single stream during spring, but not in winter. This suggests that farm brood-stock might migrate upstream to breed during spring at that particular stream. It is unclear whether interbreeding has occurred between "pure" naturalized and farm trout in this and other streams. Third, estimates of the annual number of breeders (N-b) were below 73 in half of the collections, suggestive of genetically small and recently founded populations that might experience substantial genetic drift. Our results reinforce the notion that naturalized trout originated recently from a small yet genetically diverse source and that farm propagules might have played a significant role in the invasion of Rainbow Trout within a single lake with intensive trout farming. Our results also argue for proficient mitigation measures that include management of escapes and strategies to minimize unintentional releases from farm facilities.					; Hernandez, Cristian E./GLS-1111-2022; Hernández, Cristián/NQE-6788-2025; Gomez-Uchida, Daniel/AAB-7043-2019; Arismendi, Ivan/B-3144-2010; Gajardo, Gonzalo/AAN-3507-2020; Seeb, Lisa/GSN-3076-2022	Benavente, Javiera/0000-0001-7045-1171; Hernandez, Cristian E./0000-0002-9811-2881; Gajardo, Gonzalo/0000-0001-8634-141X; Arismendi, Ivan/0000-0002-8774-9350; Gomez-Uchida, Daniel/0000-0002-5150-2030; 													1932-6203					NOV 6	2015	10	11							e0142040	10.1371/journal.pone.0142040	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0142040								26544983					WOS:000364398700074

Mean monthly 1200 UTC values of potential temperature, mixing ratio, and geopotential height were computed at the surface and 750 mb for March through September (1966-1980) for 69 upper-air stations in the continental United States and Mexico. Analyses indicated that the Gulf of Mexico is the most significant source of low-level moisture east of the Continental Divide for all months, but the Atlantic Ocean also becomes a significant source in summer. The Gulf of California was found to be the most important source of low-level moisture west of the Continental Divide in summer. A distinct synoptic scale dryline was found over west Texas from March to June and analyses suggested that the strongest drylines occur in April and May. Northwest Mexico and the desert southwest were confirmed to be the source regions of the dryline. At 750 mb, source regions of dry airmasses were found to be the Baja California region and desert southwest in spring, the tradewind easterly dry layer in summer, and the dry, cool airmasses over the northern Pacific and northern Great Lakes regions in spring and summer. The moist, summer, tropical Pacific airstream was found not only to be deeper than that from the Gulf of Mexico, but also to be the primary source of moisture west of the Continental Divide. In summer, significant mean horizontal advection of warm, moist air from higher terrain into the Missouri Valley was noted.																			0882-8156					JUN	1991	6	2					254	270		10.1175/1520-0434(1991)006<0254:ALTTCF>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0434(1991)006<0254:ALTTCF>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1991FQ94900006

And the dependence of the treatment effects on both the water quality in the typical seasons and the working mechanism of enhanced processes was analyzed and summarized. The results indicated that the pre-chlorination improved the treatment effect of conventional coagulation process in both the turbidity and algae removal effect for the raw water with the characteristics of high temperature, high algae and organic pollutants content in summer, and it improved also the algae removal effects, but weakened the turbidity removal effects for the raw water with the characteristics of low temperature, low algae content and tiny organic pollutants in winter. However, the enhanced coagulation process using composite coagulants improved even more remarkably the treatment effect of the conventional process using poly-aluminum chloride (PAC) only, for the algae-containing raw water both in summer and in winter. Especially, the improvement extent of the effects of using composite coagulants for algae-containing raw water in summer was more obviously than that in winter due to the characteristics of PDMDAAC and raw water. Besides, the turbidity and algae removal effects of enhanced coagulation process using composite coagulants could not only exceed that of the combined process of pre-chlorination and conventional coagulation using inorganic coagulants, but also indubitably replace the function of pre-chlorination for reducing the risks caused by excessively used chlorine.					; zhang, yue/GQP-5565-2022; ZHAO, XIAOLEI/JVY-7695-2024; Li, Xiaoxiao/AFS-3164-2022	Li, Xiaoxiao/0000-0001-7214-268X; 													1944-3994	1944-3986				JAN	2017	60						1	10		10.5004/dwt.2017.1198990	http://dx.doi.org/10.5004/dwt.2017.1198990													WOS:000403564800001
J	Gutowski, A				Gutowski, A			Mallomonas species (Synurophyceae) in eutrophic waters of Berlin (Germany)	NOVA HEDWIGIA												Chrysophytes with their species-specific siliceous scales serve as tools for paleolimnological studies. However, their value as indicators depends on the compliance with several taxonomical and ecological demands. There is a particular need for information on the limits of occurrence and the autecology of individual species. The present study includes records of 29 Mallomonas species sampled in 29 mostly eutrophic and alkaline water bodies exhibiting high specific conductivity. These sites offer optimum growth conditions for a limited number of species only. Chrysophytes were predominantly found during spring and autumn at low temperatures. However, some species such as M. caudata and M. tonsurata developed maxima in summer at high temperatures. The occurrence of these species is discussed with special regard to their seasonality and their preferences to temperature, specific conductivity and pH of the water bodies. Most species are specialized to eutrophic, alkaline waters (M. acaroides, M. alpina, M. caudata, M. cratis, M. striata, M. tonsurata) or indifferent to the mentioned environmental factors (M. parvula). Some species such as M. cratis, M. multiunca and M. tolerans show no clear preference and seem to be bound to local sites. Many rare species were only found at dystrophic sites which may serve as nature reserves in this eutrophic area.																			0029-5035						1997	65	1-4					299	335																WOS:A1997XE67800020

Intra-Annual Variability of Riverine Nutrient and Sediment Loadings Using Weighted Circular Statistics	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												This study analyzed the intra-annual patterns of nutrient and sediment exports from eight watersheds in the Lake Erie and Ohio River basins over long-term monitoring durations (8-32years). These primarily agricultural watersheds are the major source of pollutants delivered to Lake Erie, and through the Mississippi River system to the Gulf of Mexico. Suspended sediment (SS), total phosphorus (TP), and total oxidized nitrogen (TON) (NO3 - N + NO2 - N) levels were analyzed using weighted circular statistics in two phases based on (1)the entire observed daily data sets; and (2)the largest events. The data analysis evaluated the timing of river flows, pollutant concentrations, and corresponding loads in 1 year for each watershed. The results showed that pollutant concentrations could occur in any season, and their corresponding loads were concentrated during high-flow periods in winter and early spring, even though the largest rain events occurred in late spring and early summer. Circular statistical analyses of data and large-event examinations indicated that SS loads were more evenly distributed over the year compared with the TP and TON loads. The results indicated that a temporal difference exists between the peak riverine pollutant export and the poorest water quality conditions in the receiving water bodies. This difference underscores the need for better management through coordinated monitoring and regulatory efforts during periods of high load export. The weighted circular analysis method provided a clearer visualization and analysis tool through finer time scales than the traditional monthly analysis of nutrient and sediment data.

In the summer in southeastern Canada, northwesterly winds bring air with a constant mixing ratio of GEM at altitudes up to 7 km, with a concentration near 1.5 nanograms per standard cubic meter of air (ng sm(-3)). In the winter in southern and central Ontario the mixing ratio is still approximately constant with altitude, but the concentration is 1.7 ng sm(-3). In the spring in the Arctic the concentration of gaseous elemental mercury at altitudes above 1 km is near 1.7 ng sm(-3); however, there is evidence of episodic depletion of elemental mercury near the surface with mixing of depleted air to altitudes of 1 km. Measurements of GEM in cloud interstitial air and of mercury in cloud water indicate that the influence of a single cycling of air through cloud has little effect on the concentration of GEM. The GEM in air masses transported over the relatively unpopulated terrain of northern Canada during the summer indicates a lower limit of 5000 ng m(-2) for an atmospheric column from the surface to 5 km. This gives a global burden of at least 2500 t for that altitude range. These data demonstrate the existence of a vast pool of mercury aloft, provide evidence for a long atmospheric lifetime, and illustrate the potential for long-range atmospheric transport of this metal at altitudes up to at least 7 km.																			2169-897X	2169-8996				MAY 6	2003	108	D9							4264	10.1029/2002JD002116	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2002JD002116													WOS:000182874600002

The isotope compositions of these waters range from - 15.2 parts per thousand to + 2.8 parts per thousand for delta(18)O and from - 109 parts per thousand to - 21 parts per thousand for delta D. Rain, snow, and shallow spring waters derived from melting snow on the mountains fall on the meteoric water line (MWL). Salt pan brines fall on a local evaporation line with a slope of 3.6, indicating strong evaporation. Regional spring waters have low delta values, reflecting a different origin from the modern precipitation in Death Valley. At least three major sulfate sources were identified by the isotope data from sulfate in these waters: (1) atmospheric sulfate in precipitation; (2) dissolved sulfate from the local spring flow system; (3) dissolved marine sulfate from Paleozoic carbonate rocks in the regional groundwater system. The isotopic variations of these waters and sulfate therein reflect changing and/or mixing of sources in the basin.																			0012-821X					MAR	1997	147	1-4					69	82		10.1016/S0012-821X(97)00011-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0012-821X(97)00011-3													WOS:A1997WR84700008

Winter ice cover can influence both nutrient cycling and phytoplankton dynamics. This study focused on a small shallow hypereutrophic lake in south-central Qu & eacute;bec, Canada. We will assess ice-on vs ice-free seasonal differences in nutrient concentrations, and evolving chemical changes through winter, as they link to climatic conditions and ice phenology. The accumulation of dissolved inorganic nitrogen during the ice-on period over a decadal timestep was significantly correlated with the duration of ice cover (ranging from 102 to 166 days), meaning that long winters led to much greater nitrate concentrations at the onset of spring. Notable shifts in phytoplankton composition between ice-on and ice-free periods were observed, accompanied by a significant overall (annual) long-term decline in species richness. Crucially, nitrate-nitrite accumulation during the ice-covered period was positively correlated with the relative proportion of cyanobacteria in total phytoplankton in the subsequent growing season. This study provides evidence for the importance of understanding winter limnological characteristics relative to nutrient cycling and the seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton, particularly amid ongoing climate changes.					; Tromas, Nicolas/MGB-4006-2025; Sauve, Sebastien/K-5671-2012; Baulch, Helen/I-9529-2012; Julian, Paul/ABB-5826-2020; Simon, Dana/R-4716-2019	Tromas, Nicolas/0000-0003-4332-8463; Baulch, Helen/0000-0001-9018-4998; Simon, Dana/0000-0003-3725-2482; Sauve, Sebastien/0000-0001-8584-1690; Julian, Paul/0000-0002-7617-1354; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2025	852	6					1463	1480		10.1007/s10750-024-05739-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-024-05739-4		NOV 2024											WOS:001361000200001

Influence of climate variations on ChascomA0s shallow lake thermal conditions and its consequences on the reproductive ecology of the Argentinian Silverside (Odontesthes bonariensis-Actinopterygii, Atherinopsidae)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												It is well known that water temperature directly affects fish reproduction. The aim of this study was to develop a predictive model to determine water temperature conditions on a typical Pampas shallow lake (ChascomA(0)s, 35A degrees 36'S, 58A degrees 02'W) from local climate variables (specifically air temperature and rainfall). In addition, this model was used to assess the variability of local climate and water temperature conditions in this lake over the last 47 years, and predict possible effects on pejerrey reproductive phenology. The temperature model showed a good fit demonstrating a direct influence of the local climate into the lake water temperature. As consequence of a demonstrated warming in ChascomA(0)s City, an average increase of 1.4A degrees C was evident in ChascomA(0)s lake over the analyzed period, which was mainly due to a thermal increase during the warmer seasons (spring, summer, and autumn). This pattern of warming drove to a shortening in the pejerrey spawning season length, estimating a decrease of 19 days over the period of 47 years. Thus, this study showed that a tight association between the climate variability and the change in fish reproductive phenology can occur in species inhabiting shallow lakes.

J	Li, HL; Wang, HJ; Jiang, DB				Li, Huanlian; Wang, Huijun; Jiang, Dabang			Influence of October Eurasian snow on winter temperature over Northeast China	ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												This paper addresses the interannual variation of winter air temperature over Northeast China and its connection to preceding Eurasian snow cover. The results show that there is a significant negative correlation between October Eurasian snow cover and following-winter air temperature over Northeast China. The snow cover located in eastern Siberia and to the northeast of Lake Baikal plays an important role in the winter air temperature anomaly. More (less) eastern Siberia snow in October can cause an atmospheric circulation anomaly pattern in which the atmospheric pressure is higher (lower) than normal in the polar region and lower (higher) in the northern mid-high latitudes. Due to the persistence of the eastern Siberia snow from October to the following winter, the winter atmospheric anomaly is favorable (unfavorable) to the widespread movement of cold air masses from the polar region toward the northern mid-high latitudes and, hence, lower (higher) temperature over Northeast China. Simultaneously, when the October snow cover is more (less), the SST in the northwestern Pacific is continuously lower (higher) as a whole; then, the Aleutian low and the East Asia trough are reinforced (weakened), favoring the lower (higher) temperature over Northeast China.

Sand/dust storm processes in Northeast Asia and associated large-scale circulations	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												This paper introduces a definition of sand/dust storm process as a new standard and idea of sand/dust storm (SDS) groups a number of SDS-events in Northeast Asia. Based on the meteorological data from WMO/GOS network, 2456 Chinese surface stations and NCEP-NCAR reanalysis, the sand/dust storm processes in Northeast Asia in spring 2000-2006 are investigated. And the evolutions of anomalies of general circulation in the troposphere are analyzed by comparing the spring having most and least occurrences of SDS in year 2006 and 2003. Associated with the noticeably increased occurrence of SDS processes in spring 2006, the anomalies in 3-D structure of general circulation especially in the mid-and high latitudes of the Northen Hemisphere (NH) are revealed. The transition period from the winter of 2005 to spring 2006 has witnessed a fast-developed high center over the circumpolar vortex area in the upper troposphere, which pushes the polar vortex more southwards to mid-latitudes with a more extensive area over the east NH. In spring 2006, there are the significant circulation anomalies in the middle troposphere from the Baikal Lake to northern China with a stronger southward wind anomaly over Northeast Asia. Compared with a normal year, stronger meridional wind with a southward wind anomaly also in the lower troposphere prevail over the arid and semiarid regions in Mongolia and northern China during spring 2006. The positive anomalies of surface high pressure registered an abnormal high of 4-10 hPa in the Tamil Peninsular make a stronger cold air source for the repeated cold air outbreak across the desert areas in spring 2006 resulting in the most frequent SDS seasons in the last 10 years in Northeast Asia.

Prevalence of Trypanosoma granulosum was determined using a haematocrit centrifuge technique and parasitaemia was estimated by counting trypanosomes in 30 fields (10 ocular x 10 objective) on Giemsa-stained smears. Prevalence was consistently high in eels from the lake sites, but lower and more variable in the two stream sites. Parasitaemia was generally low and the distribution highly skewed. Individual eels carrying medium and high infections were most common in late summer and autumn. The size distribution of trypanosomes found in the blood was bimodal. Seasonal changes in trypanosome morph sizes indicated that parasitaemia did not increase immediately after infection, but was delayed until water temperatures increased during the summer months.					; Zintl, Annetta/V-5431-2019	Zintl, Annetta/0000-0001-5600-579X; 													0140-7775					SEP	1997	20	5					333	341		10.1046/j.1365-2761.1997.00306.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2761.1997.00306.x													WOS:A1997XW46800002

A record of caribou crossings, camps, and other places of cultural significance generated by Inuit elders from Baker Lake is combined with the results of an archaeological survey to identify important spring and fall sites. The survey, which employed differential Geographic Positioning System (GPS) technology to record individual archaeological features (e.g., tent rings, caches), has resulted in a Geographic Information System (GIS) database for the Fall Caribou Crossing National Historic Site. Individual 'sites' are distinguished, within a more general 'non-site' distribution of features in the study region, on the basis of two criteria: clustering of Features and the known history of use of these places by elders and previous generations of Harvaqtuurmiut Inuit. Analysis of the different kinds of features indicates considerable site variation, but also some seasonal patterning: fall has a more distinctive signature than spring. In this study, individual features are used to address questions of regional land use, site definition, and season of site occupation. This emphasis on the feature reflects the special circumstances of this project, which include the need to record archaeological materials occurring on the ground surface and spread over a large area and the availability of elders to interpret those materials.																			0004-0843					SEP	2000	53	3					260	278																WOS:000089687100007

Phytoplankton and Water Quality in Kuchane Lake (Pskov Oblast, Russia)	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												The first study of phytoplankton communities of Kuchane Lake, located in the Mikhailovskoe Reserve Museum in different seasons in 2016-2017, is presented. In total, 213 specific and intraspecific taxa from nine phylums have been identified in the phytoplankton, namely, Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta, Chrysophyta, Euglenophyta, Cyanobacteria, Dinophyta, Cryptophyta, Charophyta, and Xanthophyta. The ratio of the main phylums of microalgae was similar during the seasons studied. The floristic complex of the lake algal flora was composed of diatoms (36.6%), green algae (27.2%), and yellow-green algae (10.8%). Most of the phytoplankton genera included only one species taxon. The specific composition of the phytoplankton community varied insignificantly from spring to autumn in 2017. The minimum specific similarity of the phytoplankton communities were observed in July 2016 and August 2017. With respect to the level of biomass of planktonic algae, the lake is classified as an oligotrophic water body. The planktonic algal flora of Kuchane Lake is characterized by the dominance of cosmopolitan freshwater forms of microalgae. With respect to pH, representatives preferring weakly alkaline waters were dominant. The Milius trophic index varied from 18.0 to 39.6, reaching the maximum value in summer. The Pantle-Buck saprobity index changed very little throughout the research period. The waters of Kuchane Lake corresponded to the beta-mesosaprobic self-purification zone, quality class III.					; Volgusheva, Alena/K-2979-2016	Drozdenko, Tatyana/0000-0002-5553-2296; Volgusheva, Alena/0000-0002-0414-1236; 													1062-3590	1608-3059				DEC	2022	49	10					1769	1775		10.1134/S1062359022100107	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1062359022100107													WOS:000937072100006

Evidence of influenza A virus RNA in Siberian lake ice	JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY												Influenza A virus infects a large proportion of the human population annually, sometimes leading to the deaths of millions. The biotic cycles of infection are well characterized in the literature, including in studies of populations of humans, poultry, swine, and migratory waterfowl. However, there are few studies of abiotic reservoirs for this virus. Here, we report the preservation of influenza A virus genes in ice and water from high-latitude lakes that are visited by large numbers of migratory birds. The lakes are along the migratory flight paths of birds flying into Asia, North America, Europe, and Africa. The data suggest that influenza A virus, deposited as the birds begin their autumn migration, can be preserved in lake ice. As birds return in the spring, the ice melts, releasing the viruses. Therefore, temporal gene flow is facilitated between the viruses shed during the previous year and the viruses newly acquired by birds during winter months spent in the south. Above the Arctic Circle, the cycles of entrapment in the ice and release by melting can be variable in length, because some ice persists for several years, decades, or longer. This type of temporal gene flow might be a feature common to viruses that can survive entrapment in environmental ice and snow.					; Davydov, Sergei/S-9906-2018; Shoham, Dany/F-7140-2016	Davydov, Sergei/0000-0003-0820-9426; 													0022-538X	1098-5514				DEC	2006	80	24					12229	12235		10.1128/JVI.00986-06	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JVI.00986-06								17035314					WOS:000242617900034

Forty common species and varieties from a total of 448 taxa accounted for 89.8% of the total abundance and 88.1% of the total biomass. The average phytoplankton density (mean +/- S.E.) from April through December was as follows: 1985 - 2,020 +/- 113 cells/mL, 1984 - 2,918 +/- 196 cells/mL, 1983 - 2,567 +/- 178 cells/mL. Average biomass for the same period was: 1985 - 0.34 +/- 0.021 g/m3, 1984 - 0.41 +/- 0.44 g/m3, 1983 - 0.37 +/- 0.040 g/m3. The following predominant diatoms were observed in 1974, 1983, 1984, and 1985: Asterionella formosa, Cyclotella comensis, C. comta, C. ocellata, Fragilaria crotonensis, Melosira islandica, Tabellaria flocculosa, and Rhizosolenia spp. The historical consistency of the mesotrophic-eutrophic diatom ratio, the similarity of dominant species, the predominance of oligotrophic and mesotrophic diatom indicator species, and the similarity in phytoplankton biomass suggest little change in the trophic status of the offshore waters of Lake Huron from 1971 to 1982-85.																			0380-1330						1991	17	4					553	564		10.1016/S0380-1330(91)71391-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(91)71391-9													WOS:A1991GZ44900014

Effect of motorized watercraft on summer nearshore turbidity at Lake Tahoe, California-Nevada	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												The Lake Tahoe clarity trend is dominated by a consistent long-term decline attributed to the influx of nutrients and fine inorganic particles. The South Lake Tahoe nearshore clarity can be affected by factors such as wind waves, streamflow, boating, and urban stormwater, and the turbidity in the nearshore is greater during the summer than during the winter. In this study we measured the summer nearshore turbidity from 2 piers in South Lake Tahoe and found the summer nearshore transparency to be influenced by wind, boating, and lake currents, but not streamflow or urban stormwater. During summer 2012 the average daily increase in turbidity of Lake Tahoe's southern nearshore was 1.19 NTU following high intensity boating and 0.10 NTU following low intensity boating. Wave action and turbulence from boating in Lake Tahoe's shallow nearshore are likely to suspend sediment and release nutrients; however, there are no restrictions for boat operation in Lake Tahoe's shallow nearshore.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2013	29	4					247	256		10.1080/10402381.2013.840704	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2013.840704													WOS:000330423300003

On the basis of this information, the relationships between the weighted mean water temperature of each of these lakes and the air temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and ice-snow cover in the summer, spring, and autumn seasons, as well as year-round, were described, and the roles of the morphometry of lakes and the topography of their catchments were determined. It was found that the sensitivity of the lakes to climate warming increased with a decrease in their area/depth and shade, and with an increase in altitude and the share of wind-blown snow in the formation of the ice-snow cover. An increase in the mean annual air temperature does not necessarily translate into the warming of lakes, but, paradoxically, may result in their cooling.

J	Ikizoglu, B				Ikizoglu, Bahar			PFOA and PFOS Pollution in Surface Waters and Surface Water Fish	WATER												Perfluoroalkyl and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are among the synthetic chemicals employed by various industries since the 1950s and the most critical persistent organic pollutants (POPs) that led to emerging concerns due to high persistency, toxicity, mobility, and environmental bioaccumulation. Although there are more than 5000 types of PFASs, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorosulfonic acid (PFOS) are the two chemicals whose employment is highly restricted and banned by the Stockholm Convention. In the present study, certain water resources in the Marmara Region, the most densely populated and industrial region in Turkey, and the waters of Turkey's two largest drinking water reserves, Bey & scedil;ehir and E & gbreve;irdir lakes, were investigated. The study was carried out in two seasons, spring and autumn. The lowest and highest PFOA concentrations were determined between 1.77 +/- 0.1 and 6.71 +/- 2.9 ng/L in all surface waters, and the highest PFOS concentrations were between <LOQ and 3.27 ng/L. PFOA concentrations were higher when compared to PFOS concentrations in all water sources, and PFOA and PFOS concentrations were lower in spring compared to autumn. In some commercially procured fish from water resources, 7.48 ng/g PFOS was detected in K & uuml;& ccedil;& uuml;k & ccedil;ekmece Lake pike, and 2.5 ng/g PFOA was identified in E & gbreve;irdir Lake trout. PFOA and PFOS were not detected in other fish tissues.

J	Barker, PA; Wilby, RL; Borrows, J				Barker, PA; Wilby, RL; Borrows, J			A 200-year precipitation index for the central English Lake District	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL												The geographical context and hydroclimatology of the English Lake District means that the region is an important monitor of changes to nationally significant environmental assets. Using monthly rainfall series for sites in and around the central Lake District, a continuous similar to200-year precipitation index was constructed for a representative station close to Grasmere. The bridged series shows a significant decline in summer rainfall since the 1960s, offset by increases in winter and spring that are strongly linked to North Atlantic forcing. Over longer time periods, the index exhibits several notable dry (1850s, 1880s, 1890s, 1930s, 1970s) and wet (1820s, 1870s, 1920s, 1940s, 1990s) decades. These patterns are strongly reflected by reservoir inflow series and by indicators of the biological status of the region's freshwater lakes. It is argued that long-term climate indices will become increasingly important as managers seek to evaluate recent and project environmental changes within the context of long-term natural variability.

J	Gilbert, R				Gilbert, R			Glacilacustrine environment of part of the Oak Ridges moraine, southern Ontario	GEOGRAPHIE PHYSIQUE ET QUATERNAIRE												Glacilacustrine sediments in a 112 m core recovered from the Oak Ridges Moraine near Vandorf, Ontario are used to assess the environment at the time of deposition. Varves in the upper 23.7 m are of two types: thinner (20-110 mm) varves in groups of 29 and 23 at two levels. These are dominated by deposition of silt in summer, with lesser amounts of laminated silts and sands representing turbidity current deposition. Thicker (0.18-1.02 m) varves at the base and top of the deposit as well as in a group of 27 between the thin varves have a greater fraction in summer of coarser sediment deposited from gravity flows. Winter deposits of both are dominated by the clay-size fraction and most show at least one parting of silt or sand associated with periods of increased meltwater inflow during winter. Carbonate content varies from 25-55% with the highest proportion in the thinner deposits in winter and in the summer deposits of thin varves. It is proposed that a large, deep (greater than 100 m at least in the early phases) glacial lake was dammed on the Oak Ridges Moraine between the retreating Simcoe and Ontario lobes to the north and south, respectively, and the Niagara escarpment to the west. This lake existed as a relatively stable feature for at least 100 years.																			0705-7199						1997	51	1					55	66		10.7202/004824ar	http://dx.doi.org/10.7202/004824ar													WOS:A1997WY52000005

A one-dimensional model intercomparison study of thermal regime of a shallow, turbid midlatitude lake	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT												Results of a lake model intercomparison study conducted within the framework of Lake Model Intercomparison Project are presented. The investigated lake was Grosser Kossenblatter See (Germany) as a representative of shallow, (2 m mean depth) turbid midlatitude lakes. Meteorological measurements, including turbulent fluxes and water temperature, were carried out by the Lindenberg Meteorological Observatory of the German Meteorological Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst, DWD). Eight lake models of different complexity were run, forced by identical meteorological variables and model parameters unified as far as possible given different formulations of processes. All models generally captured diurnal and seasonal variability of lake surface temperature reasonably well. However, some models were incapable of realistically reproducing temperature stratification in summer. Total heat turbulent fluxes, computed by the surface flux schemes of the compared lake models, deviated on average from those measured by eddy covariance by 17-28 W m(-2). There are a number of possible reasons for these deviations, and the conclusion is drawn that underestimation of real fluxes by the eddy covariance technique is the most probable reason. It is supported by the fact that the eddy covariance fluxes do not allow to close the heat balance of the water column, the residual for the whole period considered being approximate to -28 W m(-2). The effect of heat flux to bottom sediments can become significant for bottom temperatures. It also has profound influence on the surface temperatures in autumn due to convective mixing but not in summer when the lake stratification is stable. Thus, neglecting sediments shifts the summer-autumn temperature difference in models lacking explicit treatment of sediments considerably. As a practical recommendation based on results of the present study, we also infer that in order to realistically represent lakes in numerical weather prediction and climate models, it is advisable to use depth-resolving turbulence models (or equivalent) in favor of models with a completely mixed temperature profile.					; Jöhnk, Klaus/B-3382-2008; Johnk, Klaus/B-3382-2008; Fang, Xing/AAC-4760-2021; Mironov, Denis/AAM-4014-2021; Subin, Zachary/K-5168-2012; Stepanenko, Victor/N-8467-2013	Subin, Zachary M/0009-0004-2244-6545; Goyette, Stephane/0000-0001-5199-5974; Beyrich, Frank/0009-0006-7554-3634; Johnk, Klaus/0000-0002-5972-4201; Stepanenko, Victor/0000-0003-3033-6712; Mironov, Dmitrii/0000-0002-3228-5851													1991-959X	1991-9603					2013	6	4					1337	1352		10.5194/gmd-6-1337-2013	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/gmd-6-1337-2013													WOS:000323981100026

To predict food-web-mediated effects of climate warming, we relied on phase-specific warming trends (during winter, early thermal stratification, summer stagnation) of an 11-year (19992009) period to study instantaneous or time-delayed ecological responses. 2.Warming during the period of early thermal stratification (here corresponding to May) rather than during winter or summer was found to generate complex, time-delayed cascading effects on Daphnia via timing and rates of predation. In contrast to our hypothesis, warming exceeding a critical mean temperature (14 degrees C) during May increased the stability of the Daphnia population during summer. 3.The termination of predation on Daphnia by older perch and L.kindtii was advanced even stronger (14days per degree Celsius warming during May) than the start of predation. Warming during May thus shortened the period of synchronised predation on Daphnia by older perch, young-of-the-year perch and L.kindtii (match index) by up to 4weeks, thereby decreasing total rates of predation on Daphnia during July by up to 40%. 4.The timing of the top-down control of Leptodora dynamics by perch proved to be a key process for population stability of Daphnia during summer compared to the less important direct cascading effect of fish on Daphnia and temperature effects on Leptodora growth and consumption or on Daphnia reproduction. 5.We conclude that predicting the consequences of climate warming for plankton dynamics requires a mechanistic understanding of lake-specific temperature-driven changes in trophic cascades, especially when an invertebrate predator is dynamically coupled both to the key herbivore and to their predators.					; Hülsmann, Stephan/N-3889-2018; Hulsmann, Stephan/K-9146-2015	Wagner, Annekatrin/0000-0003-2159-9609; Hulsmann, Stephan/0000-0002-9569-7626													0046-5070	1365-2427				MAR	2013	58	3			SI		573	587		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2012.02809.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2012.02809.x													WOS:000314805800011

Little is known about the zooplankton communities of these systems, and their relationships with the temporal and spatial distribution of flamingoes. Ten shallow lakes in the Pampean region were studied in 2009 and 2010 winters, and in 2010 summer in order to assess the abundance, size and biomass of zooplankton and the density of flamingoes populations. Zooplankton was represented by 28 species. Copepods and cladocerans were dominant when salinity was lower (winter and summer of 2010). Seasonal changes were recorded in composition and mean abundance of zooplankton. Significant differences were observed in mean size of zooplankton showing a negative relationship with the abundance of P. chilensis, which can be interpreted as a consequence of the selective flamingoes zooplanktophagy feeding upon the largest members of this community. Other community parameters, such as abundance, biomass, diversity and composition, did not show an apparent direct relationship with the presence or abundance of flamingoes.

Winter meltwater storage on Antarctica's George VI Ice Shelf and tributary glaciers, from synthetic aperture radar	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												The presence and storage of meltwater on Antarctic ice shelves has implications for ice-shelf stability and collapse, while meltwater on grounded tributary glaciers, if able to access the bed, could affect their dynamics. Given the significance of Antarctica's ice shelves for grounded ice contributions to global mean sea levels, there have been many efforts to map their meltwater extents, whereas far fewer efforts have been made to map water on Antarctica's grounded ice. Most previous mapping has used optical imagery, which is limited to mapping surface water on cloud-free days during the austral summer. Conversely, research into the prevalence of wintertime and shallow subsurface meltwater storage is scarce. Here, we analyse synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter time series between 2015 and 2021 for a selected number of large, late- and early-summer meltwater bodies on George VI Ice Shelf (GVIIS) and surrounding glaciers through intervening winters. Variable rates of surface or shallow subsurface freeze-through and melt onset are identified, alongside two locations where meltwater appears to have been stored throughout the 2019 winter. One of these sites, a large shallow subsurface meltwater body on grounded ice, appears to have retained liquid water throughout all 6 years, including during winter. This site would be valuable for further exploring how surface and shallow subsurface meltwater bodies may influence Antarctic glacier dynamics through drainage to the bed.

Ingestion experiments (winter and summer) were conducted at 2 sites in the same shallow lake that had contrasting light scenarios: open waters (light) and under profuse macrophyte coverage (dark: light attenuation similar to 97%). We compared the rates at which protists ingested 3 types of tracer prey: fluorescently labelled heterotrophic bacteria (FLB), picocyanobacteria (FLC) and picoeukaryotic algae (FLA). Light influenced both the structure of the microbial communities and the protistan grazing rates. Heterotrophic flagellates (HF) were more abundant under the macrophytes, whereas mixotrophic algae (cryptophytes) and autotrophic and heterotrophic picoplankton populations attained higher abundances in open waters. Specific grazing rates (SGRs) of mixotrophs on heterotrophic bacteria (HB) were higher in the light (7.9 to 15.5 prey cells grazer(-1) h(-1)), than in darkness (0.1 to 5.1 prey cells grazer(-1) h(-1)); the same trend was observed on picocyanobacteria (Pcy) (1.1 and 0.2 prey cells grazer(-1) h(-1), light and dark). SGRs of HF were 1.0 to 7.3 cells grazer(-1) h(-1) (on HB) and 0.01 to 1.8 prey cells grazer(-1) h(-1) (on Pcy), with highest values in summer and no pattern in relation to light. SGRs of ciliates were higher in summer and in darkness. Clearance rates (CR) on Pcy were higher than on HB, for both HF and mixotrophic algae. In winter, cryptophytes contributed up to 93% of the microbial grazing in the light, whereas HF were more important in darkness; in summer, bacterivory was dominated by heterotrophs in both light scenarios. Our experimental results highlight the importance of light conditions in structuring bacterial grazing by protists.					; Massana, Ramon/F-4205-2016; Sánchez, María Laura/AAZ-1382-2021	Unrein, Fernando/0000-0002-8592-1858; Sinistro, Rodrigo/0000-0002-8007-7213; Sanchez, Maria Laura/0000-0001-5831-1811; Schiaffino, Maria Romina/0000-0002-9383-2003; Massana, Ramon/0000-0001-9172-5418													0948-3055	1616-1564					2012	65	3					221	232		10.3354/ame01547	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame01547													WOS:000301222500002

Bedload entrainment in low-gradient paraglacial coastal rivers of Maine, USA: Implications for habitat restoration	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The rivers of coastal Maine flow through mainstem lakes and long low-gradient reaches that break the continuum of bedload transport expected in nonparaglacial landscapes. Stream erosion of glacial deposits supplies coarse sediment to these systems. The land use history includes intensive timber harvest and associated dam construction, which may have altered the frequency of substrate-mobilizing events. These watersheds are vital habitat for the last remaining wild anadromous Atlantic salmon in the United States. Future adjustments in channel morphology and habitat quality (via natural stream processes or restoration projects) depend on erosion, transport, and deposition of coarse sediment. These factors motivate our study of competence at four sites in the Sheepscot and Narraguagus watersheds. Three of the four sites behaved roughly similarly, with particle entrainment during intervals that include winter ice and spring flood conditions, and relatively minor bed mobilization during moderate floods in the summer and fall (with a recurrence interval of 2-3 years). The fourth site, on the Sheepscot River mainstem, exhibits more vigorous entrainment of marked particles and more complex three-dimensional channel morphology. This contrast is partially due to local geomorphic conditions that favor high shear stresses (particularly relatively steep gradient), but also likely to nourishment of the bedload saltation system by recruitment from an eroding glacial deposit upstream. our results suggest that the frequency and magnitude of bedload transport are reach specific, depending on factors including local channel geometry, upstream sediment supply and transport, and formation of anchor ice. This presents a challenge for stream practitioners in this region: different reaches may require contrasting management strategies. Our results underscore the importance of understanding channel processes at a given site and assessing conditions upstream and downstream as a prerequisite for conducting habitat restoration projects.

Mainly used as a source of drinking water for 300,000 residents, the lake has faced a steady degradation in water quality due to urbanization and the discharge of domestic wastewater. This study introduces a 3D hydrodynamics and water quality model using the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code to enhance our understanding of algal bloom dynamics in Lake St. Charles. More specifically, we ran simulations for eight years (i.e., a three-year period for calibration, 2015 to 2017; and a five-year period for validation, 2018 to 2022) to reproduce the complex circulation patterns and dynamics of water quality within the system. The simulation results for chlorophyll-a demonstrate seasonal fluctuations in phytoplankton biomass, closely aligning with in situ observations and achieving Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE) values below 50%. (i) In spring, runoff from snowmelt brought phosphorus into the lake, triggering primary production. Diatom growth was initially predominant in the shallow southern basin, then spread to the deeper northern basin due to favorable environmental conditions, including flow- and wind-induced currents, warmer water temperatures and nutrient availability. (ii) In summer, warm water temperatures stimulated biological activity, leading to the growth of cyanobacteria at the expense of diatoms, as well as a drop in phosphorus. (iii) The cyanobacteria persisted into the fall but began to decline in mid-November. (iv) Winter conditions, including the presence of an ice cover, limited the input of phosphorus and minimized phytoplankton production, but diatoms were observed in low concentrations near Des Hurons River inflow. Overall, during the open-water period, the lake-maintained chlorophyll-a concentrations indicative of mesotrophic conditions, with occasional periods when the biomass increased above the eutrophic threshold. Temperature, nutrient levels, and the fluvial dynamics of the lake are the primary factors influencing phytoplankton formation and distribution in lake St. Charles.					; , Wauthy/AAE-7773-2019	Wauthy, Maxime/0000-0002-7768-7133; Rousseau, Alain N./0000-0002-3439-2124													0301-4797	1095-8630				NOV	2024	370								122687	10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.122687	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.122687		OCT 2024						39383741					WOS:001332476900001

Monthly collections were taken at 4 depths (surface, 15, 31 and 92 m) at each of 7 stations along the 125 m depth contour. All samples were collected with a 6-l Van Dorn bottle sampler. Densities and biomass were determined for total protozoans and total zooplankton at each depth on each sampling date. Temperature profiles at 1-m intervals were also determined on or within a few days of the zooplankton sampling. The vertical distribution of the total protozoans was directly related to temperature; maximum densities corresponded to high summer surface temperatures. Dominant protozoan taxa included Didinium nasutum, Stokesia vernalis, Codonella cratera, Strobilidium gyrans, Strobilidium sp., Strombidium viride, Paradileptus canellai, Difflugia limnetica and unidentified ciliates belonging to the families Halteriidae, Holophryidae, Epistylidae and Vorticellidae. Protozoans composed 69% or more of the total zooplankton density on 9 of 11 dates. Protozoan dominance was most evident during winter and spring, corresponding to the near absence of rotifers and microcrustaceans. Protozoans accounted for 30% or more of the zooplankton biomass from April through June, reaching 47% in May.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1983	98	3					257	266		10.1007/BF00021027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00021027													WOS:A1983QE60800007

To evaluate spawning period duration and if females spawn multiple times during their spawning period, we compared deepwater sculpin gonadosomatic index (GSI), gonadal development, and fecundity using individuals collected in fall and spring from 2018 to 2021. Our analysis revealed female GSI was greater in fall (8.1 f 6.2 %) than spring (4.4 f 4.3 %). Absolute fecundity averaged 763 f 246 oocytes and relative fecundity averaged 19 f 6 oocytes per gram of fish. Histological analysis revealed the presence of only one batch of developing oocytes in the ovary (n = 60), indicating group-synchronous ovarian organization. Our findings suggest deepwater sculpin spawn once annually but have a protracted spawning season indicated by prolonged elevated GSI values. Therefore, protracted spawning in deepwater sculpin likely results in an extended period of larval emergence rather than the majority occurring in late spring as previously suggested. A longer timeframe for deepwater sculpin larval emergence may increase reproductive success and contribute to their population's recovery.					; Weidel, Brian/LFR-6469-2024	Weidel, Brian/0000-0001-6095-2773; Rinchard, Jacques/0000-0002-6247-2551													0380-1330					AUG	2024	50	4							102375	10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102375	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102375		JUL 2024											WOS:001274305200001

The muscle fishes contained less than 1.4% lipid by weight. Gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), allowed identification of more than 40 fatty acids and 30 of them were quantified in muscle tissue lipids of fishes. Among them, those occurring in the highest proportions were palmitic, stearic, oleic, palmitoleic and linoleic acids. The main polyunsaturated fatty acids were arachidonic acid, eicosa-5,8,11,14,17-pentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosa-4,7,10,13,16,19-hexaenoic acid (DHA). The relative amount of these acids changed significantly between species and season of collect, in particular DHA which decreased from 11.4% to 6.0% for O. macrochir during the spring to autumn period. For O. niloticus and T rendalli, DHA decreased from 9.8% to 4.9% and to 10.1% to 4.4%, respectively during the same period. Therefore the Sigma(n-3)/Sigma(n-6) ratios vary, for each species according to season of collect, being lower in autumn (0.5-0.6) and raising up to 0.7-1.6 in winter. Multivariate statistical analyses, starting from the fatty acid composition, lipid percentage and biometric ratio (weight/size) data of 113 samples, reveals significative differences between species and season of collect. Furthermore differences in fatty acid profiles are higher within season than species. The results show that wild tilapias from tropical lakes of the Madagascar highlands possess beneficial properties and therefore contribute significantly of the n-3 fatty acids intake of the local population diet.

Yet no systematic evaluation of their sustainability exists. We develop and apply a model with nine indicators to evaluate the sustainability of the 16 editions of the Summer and Winter Olympic Games between 1992 and 2020, representing a total cost of more than US$70 billion. Our model shows that the overall sustainability of the Olympic Games is medium and that it has declined over time. Salt Lake City 2002 was the most sustainable Olympic Games in this period, whereas Sochi 2014 and Rio de Janeiro 2016 were the least sustainable. No Olympics, however, score in the top category of our model. Three actions should make Olympic hosting more sustainable: first, greatly reducing the size of the event; second, rotating the Olympics among the same cities; third, enforcing independent sustainability standards. Sustainability has been added as a 'pillar' of the Olympic movement, but this analysis examines each Summer and Winter Games since 1992 to find that the performance of host cities across a range of indicators has been declining over time.					; Gogishvili, David/V-1060-2019; Müller, Martin/F-7045-2011; Gaffney, Christopher/M-2478-2014; Muller, Martin/F-7045-2011	Gogishvili, David/0000-0003-4559-6146; Wolfe, Sven Daniel/0000-0002-4517-6056; Muller, Martin/0000-0002-0734-4311													2398-9629					APR	2021	4	4					340	348		10.1038/s41893-021-00696-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41893-021-00696-5													WOS:000641869900012

The analyzed sequence covers the time span between 14400 and 10500 calendar yr B.P., and the data imply that the conditions in southernmost Greenland during the Younger Dryas stadial, 12800-11550 calendar yr B.P., were characterized by an arid climate with cold winters and mild summers, preceded by humid conditions with cooler summers. Climate models imply that such an anomaly may be explained by local climatic phenomenon caused by high insolation and Fohn effects. It shows that regional and local variations of Younger Dryas summer conditions in the North Atlantic region may have been larger than previously found from proxy data and modeling experiments.

Brachionus angularis appeared on 24 July and disappeared on 21 October. No significant correlations were found between the concentration of chlorophyll a and population parameters, but B. angularis density was positive correlated with the density of other microfilter-feeder rotifers, indicating that the B. angularis population in Lake Jinghu was not food-limited during the study period. Since there were no correlations between the density of omnivorous rotifers (e.g., Asplanchna spp.) and population parameters of B. angularis and since very few cladocerans and copepods were present, predator pressure on B. angularis did not exist. Among all the abiotic factors involved in this study, only temperature was correlated positively with the population density and the birth rate of B. angularis and had a possible effect on the proportion of mictic females in the population at the end of study.

In the small high-altitude lake Seehornsee (Northern Calcareous Alps of Austria), both species were found to be monocyclic. Arctodiaptomus alpinus hatched from resting eggs in May and June, developed fast and produced resting eggs in August. In M. laciniatus, one year old adults produced subitaneous eggs in spring and early summer. Early development of M. laciniatus was as fast as in A. alpinus but retarded from copepodid stage III onwards. As a result of their different reproductive strategies (subitaneous vs. resting eggs) and their different modes of development, both species grew up at the same time but were clearly separated in sexual activity. Body length measurements of all developmental instars revealed that both species were nearly equal in size until CII, but towards maturity A, alpinus grew larger than M. laciniatus. Arctodiaptomus alpinus hatched slightly before M. laciniatus, which resulted in an average body size difference of at least 25% between the populations during summer. Less than 2 percent of the M. laciniatus population reached maturity during summer (parallel to A. alpinus), grew as large as A. alpinus and produced exclusively resting eggs like A. alpinus. This subpopulation, which was not separated from its competitor in any dimension, is contradictory to established theories of niche separation, but might represent a long-term strategy to survive exceptional winter conditions.					; Schabetsberger, Robert/AAE-8038-2020	Schabetsberger, Robert/0000-0001-7859-6690; 													0003-9136					MAY	2000	148	2					161	185																WOS:000087119200001

In Takvatn, a subarctic lake in northern Norway, we identified the taxonomic and functional identity of the species characterizing benthic communities across three seasons and six different depths. Invertebrates were sampled using vacuum pump and Ekman grab. Despite the relative low species richness, we found large variation across depths and seasons in species functional composition using multivariate analyses. In all seasons and habitats, gathering traits were the most common feeding traits within the benthic community. The upper littoral habitat shifted from a community characterized by particle gathers and algal scrapers in spring and summer, to a community largely characterized by leaf shredders in autumn. There was also high relative occurrence of predator traits towards the deeper areas of the littoral zone, as well as in the sub-littoral and profundal habitats. The deeper habitats showed high variation in their taxonomic composition, but a stable composition of functional traits throughout all seasons. In conclusion, our study demonstrates large spatio-temporal differences in functional trait diversity and composition of the benthic invertebrates in Takvatn.

Health assessment of non-native red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans) and their impact potential on native species	PLOS ONE												Red-eared sliders (RES; Trachemys scripta elegans) are a globally invasive species that can impact native chelonian populations through resource competition and disease introduction. In Cook County, Illinois, invasive RES co-occur with, and greatly outnumber, a species of conservation priority in the Great Lakes region: the Blanding's turtle (Emydoidea blandingii). This study sampled free-ranging RES in Cook County during spring, summer, and fall in four unique locations to characterize the possible effect of this non-native species on the health of regional, sympatric, aquatic chelonians. RES (n = 242) were captured and sampled for qPCR pathogen detection, clinical pathology, and necropsy from 2018 to 2022. Multiple pathogens were detected, including Mycoplasma spp., multiple adenoviruses, Trachemys herpesvirus 1 (TrHV-1), frog virus 3, human-pathogenic Leptospira spp., Emydomyces testavorans, and Salmonella typhimurium. Mycoplasma spp. prevalence was significantly higher (p < 0.05) at one isolated site with a suspected greater density of turtles. Detection of TrHV-1 was significantly associated with season (p < 0.001), with detections occurring only in spring and fall. For the 28 hematology, plasma biochemistry, and protein electrophoresis analytes assayed, significant and variable associations occurred based on sample year, season, pathogen detection, age, and sex. Population-based reference intervals were created for hematologic, plasma biochemistry, and plasma protein electrophoresis analytes. Common necropsy findings included mild endoparasitism and related vascular lesions such as endarteritis. Notably, qPCR detection of above pathogens was not associated with any gross or histologic lesions indicative of clinically relevant disease. This study indicates that invasive RES in Cook County may be infected with pathogens of concern for co-occurring turtle species, and absence of associated lesions in the RES suggests they likely serve as carrier species for these pathogens. Continued health monitoring of this species is important as interactions with chelonians of conservation priority increase.																				1932-6203				OCT 6	2025	20	10							e0333786	10.1371/journal.pone.0333786	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0333786								41052085					WOS:001588774100004
J	Zhang, XJ; Jin, LY; Huang, W; Chen, FH				Zhang, Xiaojian; Jin, Liya; Huang, Wei; Chen, Fahu			Forcing mechanisms of orbital-scale changes in winter rainfall over northwestern China during the Holocene	HOLOCENE												The moisture history in arid central Asia (ACA) differs from that in the Asian monsoon region during the Holocene. Much less is known about causes of Holocene moisture changes in ACA than Asian monsoon precipitation changes, hampering our understanding of their spatiotemporal differences. In this study, orbital-scale evolution of winter rainfall in northwestern China (a part of the core zone in ACA) during the Holocene and possible driving mechanisms are investigated using results from a long-term transient simulation performed by an atmosphere-ocean-sea-ice coupled general circulation model, the Kiel Climate Model, forced by orbital variations. Our results reveal a persistent wetting trend in northwestern China in winter throughout the Holocene, which is in response to winter insolation at mid-northern latitudes. Winter insolation can influence the rainfall via three ways. First, increasing latitudinal gradient of the incoming solar insolation at mid-latitudes strengthens the westerly intensity. Second, the evaporation is enhanced because of insolation-induced winter temperature rising, resulting in an increase in the air humidity. Intensified westerly winds and the increased water vapour together are conductive to enhance moisture transport towards northwestern China and thus increase winter precipitation in this area. Third, the increasing trend of winter insolation weakens the East Asian winter monsoon, which is favourable for the formation of rainfall via crippling the Siberian High that is beneficial for atmospheric lifting motion.

There was no salinity gradient in the system during any of the surveys, but between the surveys there were considerable salinity differences. Summer turbidities were higher than those of winter and spring, and turbidity along the eastern edge of the system was lower than elsewhere. Chlorophyll a was present over a wide range of salinities and turbidities and was generally highest in summer. However, there was no relationship between salinity arid concentrations of chlorophyll a, and the concentrations were not significantly higher along the less turbid eastern shore. Concentrations of total particulate matter (TPM) and particulate organic matter (POM) in the < 100-mu-m fraction were significantly correlated with turbidity throughout the year, but chlorophyll a and POM (< 100-mu-m) were significantly correlated only in summer. Concentrations of TPM in the > 100-mu-m fraction were two orders of magnitude lower than those in the < 100-mu-m fraction, but the organic content of the former fraction was very much higher. There was no relationship between turbidity and TPM (> 100-mu-m), nor between chlorophyll a and POM (> 100-mu-m) concentrations. Under conditions of high TPM load arid in the salinity range 2-25 x 10(-3), phytoplankton would probably still occur in St Lucia. Estimates of phytoplankton production ranged between 218 and 252 mg C . m-2 . day-1. A comparison of estimates of the standing stocks of carbon from phytoplankton and suspended POM < 100-mu-m indicated that carbon input from sources other than phytoplankton may be important.																			0257-7615						1991	11						491	498		10.2989/025776191784287619	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/025776191784287619													WOS:A1991JE49900029

The species comprised 23-41% of all nematodes in the littoriprofundal and profundal. Mean yearly biomass was highest at 10 m depth (144 mu g/100 cm(2), fresh weight). Abundance peaked twice a year in the littoral (winter and summer) and once in deeper regions (winter). The main reproductive period is the winter. Morphometric data (n = 658) revealed sexual dimorphism in size, body shape and weight. There was consider able water depth and time dependent variation in sex ratios.

Interactive influences of nutrient loading, zooplankton grazing, and microcystin synthetase gene expression on cyanobacterial bloom dynamics in a eutrophic New York lake	HARMFUL ALGAE												We investigated the dynamics and toxicity of cyanobacteria populations in Lake Agawam, a eutrophic New York lake, and concurrently conducted experiments to evaluate the contrasting effects of zooplankton (mesozooplankton and microzooplankton) grazing and nutrient loading on the abundance and toxin content of cyanobacteria populations. Molecular techniques were used to assess the presence and expression of the microcystin synthetase gene. Lake Agawam hosted dense blooms (> 105 cells mL(-1)) of Microcystis sp. and Anabaena sp. with consistently elevated levels of microcystin (1.0-25 mu g L-1) and lower levels of anatoxin-a (similar to 1.0 mu g L-1 during late summer only). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis targeting the microcystin synthetase gene (mcyE) indicated that Microcystis sp., and not Anabaena sp., was responsible for microcystin production in this system. Moreover, reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) indicated that the Microcystis population expressed the mcyE gene during summer months, but that gene expression declined to undetectable levels during the fall as in situ cell densities in the lake declined. During summer, when there was elevated Microcystis densities (> 8 x 10(4) cells mL(-1)) expressing meyE, experimental Daphnia sp. enrichment did not alter algal biomass (100% of experiments; n = 6). However, during fall months when the mcyE gene expression was not detected and Microcystis densities were lower and declining (4 x 10(3) to 5 x 10(4) Cell S mL(-1)), zooplankton enrichment yielded significantly reduced (p < 0.05) cyanobacteria biomass relative to control treatments in most experiments (80%; n = 4). In contrast to mesozooplankton, microzooplankton actively grazed algal biomass at significant rates (1.2 +/- 0.3 day(-1)) throughout the study. Microcystis and other cyanobacterial populations did not respond to nutrient amendments during early summer but experienced significantly increased growth rates and toxin concentrations (microcystin and anatoxin-a) during late summer and early fall nitrogen enrichment experiments. As such, the dominance of Microcystis sp. blooms during the summer was linked to nutrient replete conditions and the suppression of mesozooplankton (but not microzooplankton) grazing which itself appeared to be influenced by cellular toxin synthesis by Microcystis. The demise of the bloom was associated with N-limitation which reduced growth rates and toxin production by Microcystis and in turn may have permitted zooplankton to graze cells.

Transfer and early diagenesis of biogenic silica oxygen isotope signals during settling and sedimentation of diatoms in a temperate freshwater lake (Lake Holzmaar, Germany)	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												We have investigated the transfer of oxygen isotope signals of diatomaccous silica (delta P-18(diatom)) from the epilimnion (0-7 m) through the hypolimnion to the lake bottom (similar to 20 m) in freshwater Lake Holzmaar, Germany. Sediment-traps were deployed in 2001 at depths of 7 and 16 m to harvest fresh diatoms every 28 days. The 7 m trap collected diatoms from the epilimnion being the main zone of primary production, while the 16 m trap collected material already settled through the hypolimnion. Also a bottom sediment sample was taken containing diatom frustules from approximately the last 25 years. The delta O-18(diatom) values of the 7 m trap varied from 29.4 parts per thousand in spring/ autumn to 26.2 parts per thousand in summer according to the temperature dependence of oxygen isotope fractionation and represent the initial isotope signal in this study. Remarkably, despite the short settling distance delta(18)Odimom values of the 7 and the 16 m trap were identical only during spring and autumn seasons while from April to September delta O-18(diatom) values of the 16 m trap were roughly similar to 1 parts per thousand enriched in O-18 compared to those of the 7 m trap. Isotopic exchange with the isotopically lighter water of the hypolimnion would shift the delta O-18(diatom) value to lower values during settling from 7 to 16 m excluding this process as a cause for the deviation. Dissolution of opal during settling with intact organic coatings of the diatom cells and near neutral pH of the water should only cause a minor enrichment of the 16 m values. Nevertheless, opal from the bottom sediment was found to be 2.5%. enriched in O-18 compared to the weighted average of the opal from the 7 m trap. Thus, resuspension of bottom material must have contributed to the intermediate delta O-18(diatom) signal of the 16 m trap during summer. Dissolution experiments allowed further investigation of the cause for the remarkably enriched delta O-18(diatom), value of the bottom sediment. Experiments with different fresh diatomaceous materials show an increase of opaline O-18 at high pH values which is remarkably reduced when organic coatings of the cells still exist or at near neutral pH. In contrast, high-pH conditions do not affect the delta O-18(diatom) values of sub-fossil and even fossil opal. IR analyses show that the O-18 enrichment of the sedimentary silica is associated with a decrease in Si-OH groups and the formation of Si-O-Si linkages. This indicates a silica dehydroxylation process as cause for the isotopic enrichment of the bottom sediment. Silica dissolution and dehydroxylation clearly induce a maturation process of the diatom oxygen isotope signal presumably following an exponential behaviour with a rapid initial phase of signal alteration.

J	Van Deelen, TR				Van Deelen, TR			Deer-cedar interactions during a period of mild winters: Implications for conservation of conifer swamp deeryards in the Great Lakes Region	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Conifer swamps in northern Michigan support unique, late-successional plant communities and provide important wintering areas (termed deeryards) for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman). Intense browsing by winter concentrations of deer alters swamp communities-a problem illustrated by published reports of poor recruitment of northern white-cedar (Thuja occidentalis L.). In the context of white-cedar management, I use a case history of deer-deeryard interactions in northern Michigan to show that management of conifer swamp deeryards is based on assumptions about deer-deeryard interactions that are not justified. These assumptions are that (1) deer abandon deeryards during summer and therefore do not browse white-cedar seedlings during summer, (2) deer confine themselves to areas of thick cover during winter so that white-cedar seedlings in clearcuts are not vulnerable, and (3) winters severe enough to confine deer are sufficiently frequent to allow white-cedars to grow beyond the reach of deer. Lack of recruitment of white-cedar, a species valued for its timber and its contributions to deer habitat, indicates a broader inability to adequately conserve late-successional plant communities at current deer densities. Short of managing for greatly reduced deer densities over large regions of forest, future efforts at designing "Diversity Management Areas" (sensu Alverson et al. 1994) should focus on landscape-level patterns of habitat used by discrete deer populations.

Adaptive stocking strategies of Hybrid Striped Bass in a Nebraska reservoir impacted by White Perch	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Branched Oak Reservoir is the largest reservoir in eastern Nebraska and provides an important recreational fishery to large urban centers including Omaha and Lincoln. Hybrid Striped BassMorone saxatilis x Morone chrysopsare an important component of the recreational fishery, but this population appears to have been negatively impacted following the introduction and subsequent overabundance of invasive White PerchMorone americanain the mid-1990s. This study analyzed long-term standardized sampling and stocking data from Branched Oak Reservoir to evaluate Hybrid Striped Bass stocking strategies in the presence of White Perch. The spring age-0 stocking era from 1988 to 1997 consisted largely of fry and fingerling stockings. From 1998 to 2015, stockings were adapted to advanced fall age-0s with mean +/- SE TL of 146 +/- 7 mm. From 2016 to 2019, advanced spring age-1 Hybrid Striped Bass defined the third stocking era with mean +/- SE TL of 178 +/- 13 mm. Age-1 Hybrid Striped Bass CPUE differed among stocking eras (KW = 9.81,P = 0.007) as mean +/- SE CPUE(age-1)was 2 +/- 1 fish per net night during the spring age-0 era, 1 +/- 1 fish per net night during the fall age-0 era, and 3 +/- 1 per net night during the spring age-1 era. Hybrid Striped Bass CPUE(QP)was different among eras (KW = 13.30,P = 0.001). None of the five abiotic factors assessed exhibited significant relationships to Hybrid Striped Bass CPUE(age-1,)and the strongest relationship (spring temperature) only had anr(2)value of 0.046. Information obtained from this study validates the current management decision to stock spring age-1 Hybrid Striped Bass based on the present White Perch abundances, and observed recruitment of Hybrid Striped Bass.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				JAN 1	2020	35	1					379	390		10.1080/02705060.2020.1822937	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2020.1822937													WOS:000572276100001
J	Jury, MR				Jury, Mark R.			Malawi's Shire River Fluctuations and Climate	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												Hydrological fluctuations of Malawi's Shire River and climatic drivers are studied for a range of time and space scales. The annual cycles of basin rainfall and river flow peak in summer and autumn, respectively. Satellite and model products at <50-km resolution resolve the water deficit in this narrow valley. The leading climate index fitting Shire River flow anomalies is the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) Palmer drought severity index, based on interpolated gauge rainfall minus Penman-Monteith potential evapotranspiration. Climate variables anticipate lake level changes by 2 months, while weather variables anticipate river flow surges by 2 days. Global climate patterns related to wet years include a Pacific La Nina cool phase and low pressure over northeastern Africa. Shire River floods coincide with a cyclonic looping wind pattern that amplifies the equatorial trough and draws monsoon flow from Tanzania. Hot spells are common in spring: daytime surface temperatures can reach 60 degrees C causing rapid desiccation. An anticyclonic high pressure cell promotes evaporation losses of similar to 20 mm day(-1) over brief periods. Flood and drought in Malawi are shown to be induced by the large-scale atmospheric circulation and rainfall in the surrounding highlands. Hence, early warning systems should consider satellite and radar coverage of the entire basin.																			1525-755X	1525-7541				OCT	2014	15	5					2039	2049		10.1175/JHM-D-13-0195.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-13-0195.1													WOS:000342964400020

Winter Oxygen Regimes in Clear and Turbid Shallow Lakes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Dissolved oxygen controls important processes in lakes, from chemical reactions to organism community structure and metabolism. In shallow lakes, small volumes allow for large fluctuations in dissolved oxygen concentrations, and the oxygen regime can greatly affect ecosystem-scale processes. We used high frequency dissolved oxygen measurements to examine differences in oxygen regimes between two alternative stable states that occur in shallow lakes. We compared annual oxygen regimes in four macrophyte-dominated, clear state lakes to four phytoplankton-dominated, turbid state lakes by quantifying oxygen concentrations, anoxia frequency, and measures of whole-lake metabolism. Oxygen regimes were not significantly different between lake states throughout the year except for during the winter under-ice period. During winter, clear lakes had less oxygen, higher frequency of anoxic periods, and higher oxygen depletion rates. Winter oxygen depletion rates correlated positively with peak summer macrophyte biomass. Due to lower levels of oxygen, clear shallow lakes may experience anoxia more often and for longer duration during the winter, increasing the likelihood of fish winterkills. These observations have important implications for shallow lake management, which typically focuses efforts on maintaining the clearwater state.					; Cotner, James/D-8799-2013	Rabaey, Joseph/0000-0002-9649-4855; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				MAR	2021	126	3							e2020JG006065	10.1029/2020JG006065	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JG006065													WOS:000636286700014

Water Quality Assessment in the Vicinity of Trout Farming at Lake Kholmovskoye, Primorsky District, Arkhangelsk Region	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENERAL CHEMISTRY												This study presents hydrochemical assessments conducted in the vicinity of a trout farm in Lake Kholmovskoye during the summer of 2022 and winter of 2023. Parameters including pH, mineralization, dissolved oxygen, and nutrient levels were analyzed. The compliance of these parameters with regulatory standards for water quality in fisheries was evaluated. Based on its chemical composition, Lake Kholmovskoye is classified as a low-mineralized, hydrocarbonate-type lake (131 mg/L) with a slightly alkaline pH range of 7.9-8.3. Observations indicated that concentrations of phosphorus, nitrogen, and silicon salts in both summer and winter did not exceed permissible limits for fisheries. Dissolved oxygen levels were within acceptable ranges for aquatic life during both periods of the study.

J	Davis, OK				Davis, OK			Pollen analysis of a late-glacial and Holocene sediment core from Mono Lake, Mono County, California	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Pollen analysis of a 752-cm core from Mono Lake, Mono County, California indicates generally high lake levels 11,600-7000 C-14 yr B.P., moderate lake levels until ca. 4000 C-14 yl. B.P., and fluctuating levels to the present. Drying events, with lake levels near or below the historic minimum are dated ca. 8800, 4000, 2400, and 1100 C-14 yr B.P. Chronologic control is provided by six radiocarbon dates and six volcanic ashes. The rate of upland vegetation change is greatest 11,000, 4000, and 1130 C-14 Yr B.P, Juniperus and Sequoaidendron pollen declines 11,000 yr B.P., marking the transition from late-glacial-juniper woodland to Holocene steppe. High values (5-20%) of Sequoaidendron pollen are unique to this study and may indicate the presence of these trees east of the Sierra crest. The pollen-based reconstructions of climate are generally cooler and wetter than today, with relatively dry but cool climate during the early Holocene. The contrast between higher lake levels and more arid vegetation during the early Holocene can be explained by insolation-driven seasonality. Greater summer insolation produced summer drought, but lower winter insolation led to greater snowpack, greater spring runoff, and higher lake levels. Increased Artemisia and other Compositae pollen percentages mark the establishment of modern vegetation ca. 2000 C-14 yr B.P. During the late Holocene, the pollen-based reconstructions of climate generally match the Mono Lake fluctuations proposed by Stine (1990), but fewer fluctuations are recorded.

Two invaders, one reservoir: Hydrilla shapes the distribution of zebra mussels and may facilitate their growth	AQUATIC INVASIONS												Aquatic invasive species can alter ecosystem processes, detrimentally affect native species, and facilitate the invasion of other species. One infamous aquatic invader, the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), is known to cause declines in phytoplankton through their filtering activity and facilitate the subsequent growth of macrophytes by increasing water clarity. In turn, submerged macrophytes may provide substrate for settlement of zebra mussels. The goal of this study was to examine variation in the distribution of zebra mussels and hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata subsp. verticillata) in relation to sediment composition, each other (including potential facilitation), and with season (summer vs. fall) in a subtropical reservoir. Surveys of zebra mussels and hydrilla showed that zebra mussel densities tended to be higher in rocky habitats where they were found on hydrilla and rocks (gravel and cobble), compared to muddy habitats where they were found only on hydrilla. Within the rocky habitat, zebra mussels attached to hydrilla had significantly higher densities and a smaller size than those attached to rocks. However, spring populations may be largely transient because only a small fraction of zebra mussels remained on hydrilla in early fall, almost exclusively representing a new settlement cohort based on their size distribution. Nevertheless, hydrilla may directly facilitate zebra mussel dispersal, especially in spring, as mussels attached to plant fragments can be transported downstream by currents or by human activities, such as entanglement in boat propellers and trailers. Laboratory experiments did not detect any significant impact of zebra mussels on the growth, biomass, or nutrient content of hydrilla. However, zebra mussel biomass was higher when hydrilla was present, suggesting that hydrilla may facilitate zebra mussel growth, although the difference was only statistically significant at low hydrilla densities. This study illustrates the complexities of interactions between multiple introduced species which can lead to facilitation of invasion of aquatic ecosystems.																			1798-6540	1818-5487				SEP	2025	20	3					273	290		10.3391/ai.2025.20.3.156675	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/ai.2025.20.3.156675													WOS:001578291300001
J	Takacs, CD; Priscu, JC				Takacs, CD; Priscu, JC			Bacterioplankton dynamics in the McMurdo Dry Valley lakes, Antarctica: Production and biomass loss over four seasons	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Research of the microbial ecology of McMurdo Dry Valley lakes has concentrated primarily on phototrophs; relatively little is known about the heterotrophic bacterioplankton. Bacteria represent a substantial proportion of water column biomass in these lakes, comprising 30 to 60% of total microplankton biomass. Bacterial production and cell numbers were measured 3 to 5 times, within four Antarctic seasons (October to January), in Lakes Fryxell, Hoare, and Bonney. The winter-spring transition (September to October) was included during one year. Lake Fryxell was the most productive, but variable, lake, followed by Lakes Bonney and Hoare. Bacterial production ranged from 0 to 0.009 mu g C ml(-1) d(-1); bacterial populations ranged from 3.2 x 10(4) to 4.4 x 10(7) cells ml(-1). Bacterial production was always greatest just below the ice cover at the beginning of the season. A second maximum developed just above the chemocline of all the lakes, as the season progressed. Total bacterioplankton biomass in the lakes decreased as much as 88% between successive sampling dates in the summer, as evidenced by areal integration of bacterial populations; the largest decreases in biomass typically occurred in mid-December. A forward difference model of bacterial loss in the trophogenic zone and the entire water column of these lakes showed that loss rates in the summer reached 6.3 x 10(14) cells m(-2) d(-1) and 4.16 x 10(12) cells m(-2) d(-1), respectively. These results imply that bacteria may be a source of carbon to higher trophic levels in these lakes, through grazing.																			0095-3628					NOV-DEC	1998	36	3					239	250		10.1007/s002489900111	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002489900111								9852504					WOS:000077586800003
J	Timm, T				Timm, Tarmo			Fate of Lamprodrilus isoporus (Oligochaeta: Lumbriculidae) in eutrophic lakes	BIOLOGIA					13th International Symposium on Aquatic Oligochaeta (ISAO)	SEP 07-11, 2015	Brno, CZECH REPUBLIC	Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Botany & Zoology				Lamprodrilus isoporus (Michaelsen, 1901) inhabits Lake Baikal and some other lakes connected with it, and also occurs in northern Europe. The European population, described originally as L. isoporus f. variabilis Svetlov, 1936 does not differ much from the Siberian representatives. Typical habitat of the species is the cool and oxygen-rich profundal of oligotrophic lakes. In two Estonian shallow eutrophic lakes, it has been common in the unvegetated sandy littoral and sublittoral of Lake Peipsi at depths of 1-7 m, and very rare at depths of 0.5-1 m in shallower and more eutrophic Lake Vortsjarv. L. isoporus reproduced only sexually in winter in these lakes. The summer population was comprised of larger post-reproductive and smaller young worms. Both cohorts matured in autumn. L. isoporus accounted for one fourth to one third of oligochaetes in zoobenthos samples from Lake Peipsi between the 1960s and the 1980s. Its frequency and abundance have decreased drastically beginning in the 1990s. The reason can lie in the synergistic impact of extremely hot periods in some summers, water blooms of toxic cyanobacteria, and predation by an alien gammarid, Gmelinoides fasciatus. In Lake Vortsjarv L. isoporus was still widely distributed in 1959 but was limited to a single station in the subsequent years; it has not been recorded after 1988. L. isoporus is absent from the large Swedish lakes and in many other oligotrophic lakes of northern Europe and Siberia, apparently being a relict of periglacial lakes.																			0006-3088	1336-9563				JAN	2016	71	1					5	15		10.1515/biolog-2016-0012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/biolog-2016-0012													WOS:000372095600002

Seasonal Variation in Habitat Use of Juvenile Steelhead in a Tributary of Lake Ontario	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												We examined seasonal-habitat use by subyearling and yearling Oncorhynchus mykiss (Rainbow Trout or Steelhead) in Trout Brook, a tributary of the Salmon River, NY. We determined daytime fish-habitat use and available habitat during August and October of the same year and observed differences in habitat selection among year classes. Water depth and cover played the greatest role in Steelhead habitat use. During summer and autumn, we found yearling Steelhead in areas with deeper water and more cover than where we observed subyearling Steelhead. Both year classes sought out areas with abundant cover during both seasons; this habitat was limited within the stream reach. Subyearling Steelhead were associated with more cover during autumn, even though available cover within the stream reach was greater during summer. Principal component analysis showed that variation in seasonal-habitat use was most pronounced for subyearling Steelhead and that yearling Steelhead were more selective in their habitat use than subyearling Steelhead. The results of this study contribute to a greater understanding of how this popular sportfish is adapting to a new environment and the factors that may limit juvenile Steelhead survival. Our findings provide valuable new insights into the seasonal-habitat requirements of subyearling and yearling Steelhead that can be used by fisheries managers to enhance and protect the species throughout the Great Lakes region.																			1092-6194	1938-5307				DEC	2015	22	4					717	729		10.1656/045.022.0409	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/045.022.0409													WOS:000370899000006

This study investigated the characteristics of microplastic pollution in the freshwater environments of 21 major cities across China. Through indoor and outdoor experimental analysis, we have identified the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of microplastic pollution in China's freshwater environments. Our findings indicate that the average concentration of microplastics in China's freshwater environments is 3502.6 n/m3. The majority of these microplastics are fibrous (42.5%), predominantly smaller than 3 mm (28.1%), and mostly colored (64.7%). The primary chemical components of these microplastics are polyethylene (PE, 33.6%), polyvinyl chloride (PVC, 21.5%), polypropylene (PP, 16.8%), and polystyrene (PS, 15.6%). The abundance of microplastics in China's freshwater environments generally tends to increase from west to east and from south to north, with the lowest concentration found in Xining, Qinghai (1737.5 n/m3), and the highest in Jiamusi, Heilongjiang (5650.0 n/m3). The distribution characteristics of microplastics are directly related to land use types, primarily concentrated in areas of intense human activity, including agricultural, transport, and urban land. Seasonal changes affect the abundance of microplastics, peaking in summer, followed by spring and autumn, mainly due to variations in rainfall, showing a positive correlation.					; Cao, Tingting/LIG-9011-2024; Tingting, Cao/ABF-8358-2021; He, Weihua/AAD-7154-2020; Luo, Yunchao/GPW-6380-2022	Tian, Xingjun/0000-0002-0251-2582; Cao, Tingting/0000-0002-3688-4691; Zeng, Xiaoyi/0000-0002-4613-1626; Luo, Yunchao/0000-0002-6102-0326														2073-4441				MAY	2024	16	9							1270	10.3390/w16091270	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16091270													WOS:001220063400001

The bacterial population involving dimethylarsinic acid (DMAA) degradation was investigated in Lake Kibagata from April to December in 2003. During the experimental period, the methylated arsenic was not detected, although the inorganic arsenic concentration ranged from 3.4 nM to 9.2 nM. Moreover, in the sample water of Lake Kibagata to which DMAA added, DMAA decreased while inorganic arsenic increased for 25 days. These facts suggested that the bacteria remineralized methylate arsenic species to inorganic arsenic. In fact, monitoring the use of Most Probable Number (MPN) procedure demonstrated that the DMAA-degrading bacteria exist at cell densities ranged from 41 cells/ml to 510 cells/ml. To determine the composition of DMAA-degrading bacteria, the total 110 isolates obtained as dominated bacterial species were analyzed by the restriction-fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of 16S rDNA. As a result, total 110 isolates were classified into 12 types, of which 4 types dominated during the spring and/or fall seasons, and the rest 8 types dominated during summer season. DMAA degrading activities of the 110 isolates ranged at various degrees. Especially, the some isolates of fall season tend to show high degradation activities. The phylogenetic analysis using 16S rDNA revealed that the representative isolates formed several clusters in the gram-positive bacterial group and the proteobacteria subdivision. The diverse compositions of DMAA-degrading bacteria would seasonally change to control the rates of organoarsenic degradation in Kibagata.

Bionomics and Vector Potential of Culex thriambus (Diptera: Culicidae) Mosquitoes in Lake County, California	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY												California statewide West Nile virus (WNV) minimum infection rates in Culex thriambus Dyar mosquitoes are high; however, few specimens are submitted and tested each year, as their distribution seems limited to larval habitats along riparian systems. To evaluate the role of Cx. thriambus in the amplification, maintenance, and overwintering of WNV in Lake County, CA, the bionomics and vector potential of the species was investigated during 2014 and 2015. Culex thriambus was the most abundant mosquito species, with 1,153 adults and 7,624 immatures collected by vacuum aspiration and dip sampling, respectively, at the primary study site. Detection of WNV in four mosquito pools during September through November coincided with peak seasonality. Females entered and maintained a reproductive diapause during winter under field and seminatural conditions. Diapause was initiated in the majority of Cx. thriambus females by October and was terminated by 30 March. Some parous females (7.1%) and those in host-seeking arrest (7.1%) were collected throughout the winter period. An accrual of 679.51 degree-days (degrees D) was necessary for diapause termination under seminatural conditions. Culex thriambus females fed on 16 different avian species during spring and summer, and no mammalian feeds were detected. West Nile viral RNA was detected in four of 42 Cx. thriambus pools tested during June through November and infection rates ranged from 3.53-28.15/1,000 tested. In summary, WNV transmission may be increased along riparian corridors throughout California where Cx. thriambus mosquitoes remain relatively abundant.

Due to the SAL and ALT differences in these systems, they were distinguished under two groups (high elevated freshwater lentic systems [HEF] and hyposaline lentic systems [HYP]). The Bray-Curtis and Canonical Correspondence (CCA) analyses based on diatom species also confirmed this separation. In HYP, SAL and alkalinity (ALK) were the most effective parameters on diatom assemblage. On the other hand, diatom assemblage was mainly affected by ALT in HEF. For the biological assessment of these systems, seven diatom indices were implemented. Although most of the indices showed higher regression with SAL and ALT, they did not give the intended result in the evaluation of HYP. On the other hand, the most consistent index with environmental variables and dominant species in HEF was the Generic Diatom Index (IDG).

Based on the comprehensive index method, the riverine waters showed serious contamination; especially the chemical oxygen demand (COD), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), mercury (Hg) and dissolved oxygen (DO) were out of range of the contamination warning. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total suspended matter (TSM) with prominent non-homogenizing were significantly high in the riverine waters, but chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) was the opposite. The ternary phase diagram showed that non-algal particle absorption played an important role in total non-water light absorption (>50%) in most sampling locations, and mean contributions of CDOM were 13% and 22% in the summer and autumn, respectively. The analysis of the ratio of absorption at 250-365 nm (E-250:365) and the spectral slope (S275-295) indicated that CDOM had higher aromaticity and molecular weight in autumn than in summer, which is consistent with the results of water quality and the CDOM relative contribution rate. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that the environmental variables OSM (Organic suspended matter) had a strong correlation with CDOM absorption, followed by heavy metals, e.g., Mn, Hg and Cr6+. However, for the specific UV absorbance (SUVA(254)), the seasonal values showed opposite results compared with the reported literature. The potential reasons were that more UDOM (uncolored dissolved organic matter) from human sources (wastewater effluent) existed in the waters. Terrigenous inputs simultaneously are in relation to the a(CDOM)(440)-DOC relationship with the correlation coefficient of 0.90 in the summer (two-tailed, p < 0.01), and 0.58 in the autumn (two-tailed, p < 0.05). Spatial distribution of the CDOM parameters exhibited that the downstream regions focused on dry land have high CDOM molecular weight and aromatic hydrocarbon. Partial sampling locations around the cities or countries generally showed abnormal values due to terrigenous inputs. As a bio-optical model parameter, the spectral characteristic of CDOM is helpful in adjusting the derived algorithms in highly polluted environments. The study on organic carbon and pollutants in highly polluted waters had an important contribution to global carbon balance estimation and water environment protection.

Thermal habitat use by lake trout in two contrasting Yukon Territory lakes	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Thermal habitat use by lake trout Salvelinus namaycush in two northern lakes in the southern portion of the Yukon Territory that differ in morphometry and thermal regime was monitored using temperature-sensitive acoustics and radiotelemetry. We then contrasted in situ temperature selection by lake trout in these lakes with previously published estimates of the species' optimal thermal range of 8-12 degrees C. We found that thermal habitat use by lake trout in the two northern lakes is not consistent with these literature-derived expectations. In Dezadeash Lake, which is isothermal in summer, temperatures typically exceeded the literature-derived upper limit of 12 degrees C. Throughout the summer lake trout sought the coldest water in the lake, which was in the form of shallow coldwater plumes derived from alpine ice-pack meltwater streams. Once lake temperatures declined in the fall, lake trout were distributed throughout the lake. In Kathleen Lake, where water temperatures ranged from approximately 2 degrees C to 12 degrees C in the summer, the majority of lake trout selected habitats throughout the summer and fall that were colder than the 8 degrees C lower limit of their literature-derived optimal thermal range. Our results highlight the importance of summer thermal refugia for lake trout inhabiting marginal systems and the variation in thermal habitat use among populations inhabiting different thermal environments. Given the established importance of thermal habitat availability to lake trout production, our results suggest the need to better understand optimal thermal habitat characteristics in nature, particularly in light of factors such as climate warming.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAY	2006	135	3					727	738		10.1577/T05-138.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T05-138.1													WOS:000238676600015

Ichthyofaunal assemblages in shallow littoral habitats of permanently open estuaries and intermittently closed and open lakes or lagoons in Otago, New Zealand	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Fish assemblages of New Zealand estuaries are poorly studied, and knowledge of the effects of estuary-ocean connections on the ichthyofaunal composition of estuaries remains limited. Understanding the status of fish composition of estuaries is crucial for planning for sustainable management of aquatic ecosystems. In the present study we sampled fish using a seine net from lower reaches of six permanently open estuaries and six intermittently closed and open lakes or lagoons (ICOLLs) along the Otago coastline during winter 2016 and summer 2017. Marked differences in ichthyofaunal composition were observed in the shallow littoral habitats of permanently open estuaries and ICOLLs. Fish assemblages reflected estuary-ocean connection status of estuaries during both seasons. ICOLLs showed greater fish abundance than permanently open systems. Fish abundance was higher in summer than in winter in both estuary types. Fish species with marine-estuarine opportunist and estuarine-migrant life histories dominated permanently open estuaries. Conversely, species with a diadromous life history but known to form landlocked populations were abundant in ICOLLs. Salinity and temperature were correlated with fish abundance in both estuary types.

The study is a continuation of a hydrodynamic modeling experiment to compute water circulations throughout the 1970 shipping season, also in this issue, and makes use of ship observations of Cl- distributions at approximately 4 wk intervals during 1970, together with estimates of river loadings for the same periods. The model equations are based on the time-dependent, mass-conserving advection-diffusion equation. A vertically mixed, 1-layer, 2-dimensional model is employed for spring and fall, whereas a 2-layer model is used to simulate the stratified lake in summer. The equations are solved by finite-difference formulations on a horizontal grid with a mesh size of 6.67 km. Using time steps of 6 h, predictions are made of the change of Cl- concentrations between pairs of cruises and the results are compared with observations. While the advective currents are derived from the previous hydrodynamic study, diffusion coefficients are estimated by comparing model results for a range of coefficients. The resulting numerical values compare favorably with findings of diffusion experiments in actual lake environments.																									1976	33	3					537	549		10.1139/f76-071	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f76-071													WOS:A1976BJ94800014
J	Tokano, T				Tokano, Tetsuya			Impact of seas/lakes on polar meteorology of Titan: Simulation by a coupled GCM-Sea model	ICARUS												The detection of large hydrocarbon seas/lakes near the poles by the Cassini spacecraft raises the question as to whether and how polar seas affect the meteorology on Titan. The polar meteorology and methane hydrological cycle in the presence of seas are investigated by a three-dimensional atmospheric general circulation model coupled to a one-dimensional sea energy balance model considering the observed sea/lake geography. The sea composition has a large control on the seasonal evolution of seas, temperature and wind system in the polar region, particularly in the north where large seas are located. The surface of ethane-rich seas, which do not evaporate methane, undergo a large seasonal temperature variation and the sea surface is often warmer than the surrounding land surface. Land breeze in summer towards the seas causes a moisture convergence over the seas, which leads to enhanced summer precipitation in the sea area. On the other hand, methane-rich seas evaporate some methane and are therefore colder than the surroundings. This causes a sea breeze across the north pole in summer, which blows away the moisture from the polar region, so precipitation becomes scarce in the north polar region. The breeze can become stronger than the tidal wind. Sea evaporation peaks in winter, when the temperature and average methane mixing ratio in the planetary boundary layer become lowest. The sea level predominantly rises in summer by precipitation and retreats in winter by evaporation. The meteorology in the south polar region is less sensitive to the composition of the lakes because of the paucity and smallness of southern lakes. Lake-effect precipitation can occur either by moisture convergence by the breeze or humidity enhancement over the seas, but is more characteristic of warm seasons than of cold seasons.

Gary			Size spectra analysis of a decade of Laurentian Great Lakes data	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Size spectra analysis (SSA) is used to detect changes in food webs by simplifying complex community structures through abundance-versus-biomass considerations. We applied SSA to 10 years (2006-2015) of data on Great Lakes organisms ranging in size from picoplankton to macrozooplankton. Summer pelagic size spectra slopes were near the theoretical value of -1.0, but spring slopes were steeper, reflecting seasonal differences in abundance of small and large individuals. Pelagic size spectra slopes were relatively stable over the time period we examined. Height (the predicted number of organisms at the spectra midpoint) varied among lakes and was slightly higher in summer than spring in more productive basins. Including benthic data led to shallower slopes when combined with pelagic data, suggesting benthic organisms may increase food web efficiency; height was less affected by benthic data. Benthic data are not routinely included in SSA, but our results suggest they affect slopes and therefore SSA-based predictions of fish abundance. The ability of SSA to track changes in trophic energy transfer makes it a valuable ecosystem monitoring tool.					; Feiner, Zachary/A-2117-2009; Evans, Thomas/I-2446-2019; Mason, Doran/ABF-1415-2020	Scofield, Anne/0000-0001-6273-8084; Evans, Thomas/0000-0001-6717-4521; Reavie, Euan/0000-0001-8871-5809; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				JAN	2022	79	1					183	194		10.1139/cjfas-2020-0144	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2020-0144													WOS:000740695100016
J	KUVLESKY, WP; KEITH, LB				KUVLESKY, WP; KEITH, LB			DEMOGRAPHY OF SNOWSHOE HARE POPULATIONS IN WISCONSIN	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY												During March 1980-Aug. 1981, snowshoe hares (L. americanus) were live-trapped near the species'' southern geographic limit in central Wisconsin. From this sample, and earlier work (1965-1967) in northern Wisconsin, a number of demographic parameters were esimated. Snowshoe densities declined in both regions during the study years. There were 37 adults per 100 ha in central Wisconsin (summer 1980), and a maximum of 206/100 ha in the north (summer 1965). Sex ratios did not differ from 50:50. Adults comprised about 50% of fall and winter populations during each decline. Mean dates of 1st-litter conceptions were March 20, 1980 and March 4, 1981 in central Wisconsin, but much later (April 9, 1965) in northern Wisconsin. Potential natality was higher in central than in northern Wisconsin, i.e., 10.8 vs. 6.4 young per adult female; and higher too than reported elsewhere in the Great Lakes Region. This was due to a sustained high rate of pregnancy, and the occurrence of a 4th litter group. It is unlikely that either the abundance of snowshoe hares or their southern geographic limit in central Wisconsin is being determined by factors tending to depress reproduction. Annual adult and juvenile (1st-yr) survival were estimated at 0.22 and 0.11, respectively, in central Wisconsin (1980-1981), and 0.31 and 0.07 in northern Wisconsin (1965-1966). These rates are similar to those reported during population declines elsewhere.																			0022-2372	1545-1542					1983	64	2					233	244		10.2307/1380553	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1380553													WOS:A1983QR82900005

Glen			The spatial distribution of different phytoplankton functional groups in a Mediterranean reservoir	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												A new high-resolution spectrofluorimetric probe and an automatic water-quality monitoring station (AWQMS) have been used to record seasonal variations in the spatial distribution of three functional groups of phytoplankton in a Mediterranean water-supply reservoir. In comparison with classical methods, the combined use of these innovative techniques enables development of faster and less laborious spatial distribution surveys, thus favouring higher-frequency and spatially more detailed measurements, and, consequently, a better understanding of phytoplankton dynamics. The results show that the observed variations can be explained by the interaction between the buoyancy properties of the phytoplankton and the mixing characteristics of the reservoir. During the winter, when the lake was isothermal and the phytoplankton was dominated by diatoms, there was no significant spatial variation. In the spring, when the phytoplankton was dominated by chlorophytes there was also very little variation but some motile species formed patches when the wind speed was low. The most pronounced non-uniform distributions of phytoplankton were observed during the summer when the phytoplankton community was dominated by positively buoyant cyanobacteria. Then there was a very strong link between the vertical and horizontal gradients which were also related to the prevailing meteorological conditions.					; Moreno-Ostos, Enrique/R-6782-2019; Cruz-Pizarro, Luis/H-5318-2015	Moreno Ostos, Enrique/0000-0001-9471-3922; Cruz-Pizarro, Luis/0000-0003-0687-0704													1386-2588	1573-5125				MAR	2008	42	1					115	128		10.1007/s10452-007-9087-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-007-9087-1													WOS:000253197700012

Modeling the potential for managing invasive common carp in temperate lakes by targeting their winter aggregations	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) is one of world's most invasive fish and managers have long searched for practical control strategies for this species. In temperate systems, common carp forms large winter aggregations that can be located with telemetry and removed with seine nets. This has been viewed as an excellent management possibility, but its success has been mixed. Using a modeling approach, we demonstrate that the usefulness of winter seining in controlling common carp in temperate North American lakes depends on whether carp populations are driven by one of two distinct recruitment dynamics. In lakes where carp can easily recruit within systems from which they are being removed, such as within productive lakes with poor communities of micropredators, winter seining is unlikely to be effective. Even very high removal rates (90 % adults annually) were not sufficient to reach management goal (biomass < 100 kg/ha) in such systems. However, in regions with strong predatory communities where carp can recruit only in outlying, seasonally unstable marshes, removal rates as low as 30 % annually or 50 % every other year were able to reduce carp biomass below the management threshold. Such removal rates are achievable as they fall within the range of empirically measured values. Because many carp populations are driven by external recruitment dynamics, strategically conducted winter removal could be used to control this species in a large number of systems across temperate North America and elsewhere.																			1387-3547	1573-1464				MAR	2016	18	3					831	839		10.1007/s10530-016-1054-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-016-1054-0													WOS:000370657100017
J	WATSON, NHF				WATSON, NHF			SEASONAL DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE OF CRUSTACEAN ZOOPLANKTON IN LAKE ERIE, 1970	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												The lakewide horizontal distribution and seasonal abundance of the cyclopoids, cladocerans and calanoids in Lake Erie [Canada, USA] from April-Dec. 1970, are presented. Over much of the year cyclopoids dominated by Diacyclops bicuspidatus thomasi were most numerous with offshore centers of abundance. Several species of cladocerans, often with short peaks of occurrence, were most abundant during summer in the Western basin and associated with S shore population centers in the central basin. Calanoids were frequently much less abundant than either of the 2 groups but present in the same areas as the cladocerans. Most species present were short-lived with a high reproductive potential. Environmental clues are postulated to control specific abundance making group numbers more constant. Several life-cycle patterns were evident including species with spring-fall maxima and those with a single peak. Timing of peak abundance of certain species and groups varies from west to east in the same fashion as temperature differences giving rise to E-W gradients of abundance which change with season. Cladoceran and calanoid groups show similarities in distribution pattern with estimates of particulate organic material rather than with algal abundance resulting in N-S gradients of abundance.																									1976	33	3					612	621		10.1139/f76-077	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f76-077													WOS:A1976BJ94800020

High-resolution diatom δ18O records, from the last 150 years, reflecting changes in amount of winter precipitation in two sub-Arctic high-altitude lakes in the Swedish Scandes	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Waters from high-altitude alpine lakes are mainly recharged by meteoric water. Because of seasonal variations in precipitation and temperature and relatively short hydraulic residence times, most high-altitude lakes have lake water isotopic compositions (delta O-18(lake)) that fluctuate due to seasonality in water balance processes. Input from snowmelt, in particular, has a significant role in determining lake water delta O-18. Here we compare two high-resolution delta O-18(diatom) records from lake sediments in the Swedish Scandes with instrumental data from the last century obtained from nearby meteorological stations. The time period AD 1900-1990 is characterised by an increase in winter precipitation and high winter/summer precipitation ratios and this is recorded in delta O-18(diatom) as decreasing trends. Lowest delta O-18(diatom) values and highest amount of winter precipitation are found around AD 1990 when the winter North Atlantic Oscillation index was above +2. We conclude that for the last 150 a the main factor affecting the delta O-18(diatom) signal in these sub-Arctic high-altitude lakes with short residence times has been changes in amount of winter precipitation and that delta O-18(diatom) derived from high-altitude lakes in the Swedish Scandes can be used as a winter precipitation proxy.

Mass balance studies were used to examine net gains and losses of P along the river reach. The P concentrations are found to be very variable throughout the year with maximum levels, reaching 0.21 mg L-1, being observed during the low flows and minimum - during the flood events 0.04 +/- 0.008 mg L-1. Results showed that phosphorus was retained within the river system during the high flows in winter and spring, whereas net export of P occurred in summer period mainly due to internal loading. Under summer low-flow conditions, high temperature and low redox potential facilitate P release from river bed sediments into both sediment pore waters and the water column. At this time, the Narew Anastomosing River System (NAS) provides an important P source, which can affect the downstream habitats by additional load of highly bioavailable P. It appears that NAS, through its specific character, can transform the water chemistry and transport rate, compared with river fragments located upstream and downstream. It provides an example of a discontinuity analogical to the shallow lakes in lowland river systems. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Vassiljev, J				Vassiljev, J			The simulated response of lakes to changes in annual and seasonal precipitation: implication for Holocene lake level changes in northern Europe	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Experiments with a coupled lake-catchment model show that lakes in temperate humid climates are highly sensitive to changes in both mean annual and seasonal precipitation. Simulations of three lakes from northern Europe (Lake Bysjon, Sweden; Lakes Karujarv and Viljandi, Estonia) show that lake level is more sensitive to decreases than to increases in precipitation. Increased precipitation results in increased runoff, but this is largely compensated by increased outflow and the change in lake level is small. Reductions in winter (November-April) precipitation have a bigger impact on simulated lake level than changes in summer (May-October) precipitation. Evapotranspiration is highly sensitive to reduction in precipitation, particularly in summer, but relatively insensitive to increased precipitation. Runoff decreases more rapidly with a decrease in winter precipitation and increased precipitation will linearly increase runoff. To match observed lake-level changes at Lake Bysjon at 9000 and 6000 y. BP (ca 6-7 m and 4-5 m lower than present respectively), without changing other climate parameters, would require a decrease in annual precipitation of about 400-500 mm and 350-400 mm respectively. The same changes in lake level could be produced by decreasing precipitation in winter precipitation by about -200 mm and about -175 mm respectively. The simulations suggest that a lake, which is large relative to its catchment, is more likely to register lake-level changes caused by changes in climate.

Interannual and long-term changes in the trophic state of a multibasin lake: effects of morphology, climate, winter aeration, and beaver activity	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Little St. Germain Lake (LSG), a relatively pristine multibasin lake in Wisconsin, USA, was examined to determine how morphologic (internal), climatic (external), anthropogenic (winter aeration), and natural (beaver activity) factors affect the trophic state (phosphorus, P; chlorophyll, CHL; and Secchi depth, SD) of each of its basins. Basins intercepting the main flow and external P sources had highest P and CHL and shallowest SD. Internal loading in shallow, polymictic basins caused P and CHL to increase and SD to decrease as summer progressed. Winter aeration used to eliminate winterkill increased summer internal P loading and decreased water quality, while reductions in upstream beaver impoundments had little effect on water quality. Variations in air temperature and precipitation affected each basin differently. Warmer air temperatures increased productivity throughout the lake and decreased clarity in less eutrophic basins. Increased precipitation increased P in the basins intercepting the main flow but had little effect on the isolated deep West Bay. These relations are used to project effects of future climatic changes on LSG and other temperate lakes.

Data revealed that during the late-glacial to early Holocene, the lake and its catchment area, western Hindu Kush, were under a more prominent influence of the Indian Ocean monsoon and formed a moist and productive environment with less wind action, as shown by the provenance of high organic matter lacustrine sediments together with the lack of an aeolian fraction. Due to southward migration of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone during the mid Holocene, arid climate manifested by an interplay of seasonal aeolian and fluvial deposition became dominant. These conditions were due to reinforcement of subtropical anticyclones on the Iranian plateau. The presence of green to brownish green moderate organic matter lacustrine sediments showed that during the late Holocene, Mediterranean-type winter precipitation dominated in the area. During the initial part of this period, the Shahr-iSukhteh civilization was close to the lake. The environment was relatively similar with that of today. Some palaeostorms can also be detected during this time interval, shown by occurrences of high aeolian inputs in the basin. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Stein, as well as the relevant in situ environmental factors, in brackish Lake Shihwa, Korea. We also examined the growth rates and morphological characteristics of the species in laboratory cultures. In the field, the population densities of H. triquetra remained at low levels from late spring to early summer, and then completely disappeared from August to November 2007. Interestingly, a dense bloom of H. triquetra appeared below the ice surface on 17 January 2008; identities of the cells were confirmed by rDNA sequence comparisons. The second peak reached a density of 672 103 cells L-1 on 28 March 2008, at a water temperature of 9.1 degrees C. Laboratory experiments showed that growth rates of H. triquetra increased with incremental temperature increases within the range of 10 and 20 degrees C. The highest growth rate reached by H. triquetra was 0.62 d(-1) at 20 degrees C with a salinity of 30. Above 25 degrees C, the dinoflagellate was unable to grow between salinities of 10 and 15, and reached only relatively low growth rates (<0.12 d-1) under other salinity conditions. However, under continuous cultures at 5 degrees C and 8 degrees C, H. triquetra cells retained its growth capability for more than 12 days, implying that H. triquetra can survive and grows even at very low temperatures. The equivalent spherical diameter (ESD) of H. triquetra did not change markedly between 10 and 25 degrees C, but the equivalent spherical diameter was significantly different at 5 degrees C. The cell volume buildup of H. triquetra at low temperatures is one of the important survival strategies to overcome the harsh environmental conditions. These characteristics make H. triquetra a consistently dominant dinoflagellate in Lake Shihwa during the cold winter season.					; KIM, YOUNG JIN/E-9374-2011; katano, toshiya/O-1904-2014; Park, Bum/W-3178-2017; PARK, Bum Soo/W-3178-2017; KATANO, Toshiya/O-1904-2014	Shin, Hyeon Ho/0000-0002-9711-6717; Baek, Seung Ho/0000-0003-2722-5907; katano, toshiya/0000-0001-5184-3065; BAEK, SEUNG HO/0000-0002-5402-2518; PARK, Bum Soo/0000-0002-5441-6779; 													1322-0829	1440-1835				OCT	2011	59	4					273	285		10.1111/j.1440-1835.2011.00626.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1835.2011.00626.x													WOS:000296028300007

Spatiotemporal interactions of native and introduced salmonid top predators in a large lake: implications for species restoration	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Animal interactions are an integral part of a community's function, with influences ranging from the spatiotemporal habitat use of species to population effects to ecosystem management. Numerous non-native species are established or maintained through stocking in freshwater ecosystems with the potential to affect restoration of native species. Using acoustic telemetry, this study quantified the spatiotemporal co-occurrence of the native top-predator lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) with non-native Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in Lake Ontario over 2.5 years. Core home range overlap was observed during the summer, with depth acting as a mechanism of segregation, but with potential for interactions during vertical exploration. Fine-scale individual pairwise interactions confirmed the home range results. No horizontal overlap was observed during the winter and spring, but confidence was lower due to poor instrument coverage in deeper water, which the two species may frequent in these seasons. These results demonstrate the importance of depth in understanding fish interactions and highlight the usefulness of considering pairwise species interactions for understanding ecosystem community function to resource managers with multiple projects involving both native and non-native species.

Abdel			Spatiotemporal distribution of urea in seawater along the eastern Mediterranean Sea coast in Egypt	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Urea contributes to coastal eutrophication as a component of bioavailable dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). Although the Mediterranean Sea is one of the world's most important bodies of water, no data on urea concentrations has been recoded. This study marks the first comprehensive survey evaluating urea-N concentrations along the Egyptian Mediterranean Sea coast. More than 200 water samples were collected from eight sectors for three different seasons (winter 2020, summer 2021, and spring 2023) at varying layers (surface, 10 m depth and bottom). Overall, urea concentrations ranged from 0.35 to 5.14 mu mol/L. The highest absolute values were recorded in surface waters during spring. The findings revealed an elevation of urea-N concentration, particularly in estuarine areas. This emphasize the influence of external sources on urea-N variations. Significantly different seasonal variations in urea concentration were observed (p < 0.05). The main interest of this study is that the spatial distribution of urea-N concentrations in the 10 m water layer, whether at a total depth of 30 m or 50 m, is consistent across almost all sectors throughout all seasons. This reflects the influence of biological activities at this layer. This work is considered as data base of Mediterranean Sea coast for further investigations. The obtained information is essential for policy makers to have informed decision aimed at preserving and protecting this valuable coastal area of marine environment.

J	Tang, CY; Li, YP; Acharya, K				Tang, Chunyan; Li, Yiping; Acharya, Kumud			Modeling the effects of external nutrient reductions on algal blooms in hyper-eutrophic Lake Taihu, China	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Harmful algal blooms in Lake Taihu, China, are getting plagued due to excess nutrients loads. Despite several recent strict nutrient management strategies, especially to reduce the external nutrient loads, Lake Taihu still receives large amounts of nutrients from its tributaries. As a result, frequency and intensity of algal blooms have not abated as expected. In this study, a three-dimensional eutrophication model was used to identify the limiting factors for algal growth and the effect of external nutrient loads reduction on water quality. The modeling results showed that the limiting factor for the dominant algae (cyanobacteria) depended on seasonality and location. Water temperature affected algal growth in winter, while light was important for deeper water columns in all seasons. Phosphorus (P) and Nitrogen (N) impacted algal growth from spring to autumn. Results showed that Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentrations only decreased about 38%, 26% and 24% in Meiliang Bay, Zhushan Bay and Northwest Zone, respectively when implementing high nutrient reduction scenario (external N and P inputs reduced up to 80% and 50%). External nutrient reduction for both N and P is a prudent and likely most practical solution for reducing bloom potentials and overall trophic state of this currently hypereutrophic system. However, achieving observable algal control is not likely in the short term and other ecological restoration tools will be required to battle with the legacy of several decades of nutrient over-enrichment.

Multi-year evaluation of muskellunge (Esox masquinongy) spatial ecology during winter drawdowns in a regulated, urban waterway in Canada	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Winter is an ecologically challenging time for freshwater fishes in temperate regions. In aquatic systems that experience annual winter water-level drawdowns, the pressures that fish already face during winter can be exacerbated. The Rideau Canal, a 202 km waterway located in eastern Ontario, Canada, is one such freshwater system that encounters these challenges. The 8.3 km "Eccolands Reach," near Ottawa, experiences a considerable annual drawdown from mid-October to mid-May of 1.79-2.13 m and is home to a self-sustaining, urban muskellunge population. Because the Eccolands Reach is relatively shallow and narrow, the drawdown may significantly reduce overwintering habitat. We used acoustic telemetry and hydraulic measurements to evaluate connectivity, critical winter habitats, and residency patterns of muskellunge (N = 23) over two drawdown seasons (2020-2021; 2021-2022) in the Eccolands Reach. Our results revealed that most muskellunge overwinter in a central portion of the reach with distinct, contiguous deeper sections and that the drawdown functionally fragments the river in several areas, eliminating connectivity to adjacent habitats, by creating shallow-water barriers and high-velocity currents in riverine constrictions. Additionally, we documented potential spring spawning movements and discuss implications of reproduction prior to system refill. Our work provides insights into connectivity and winter habitats of muskellunge in a regulated waterway.

Autonomous identification and classification of ionospheric sporadic E in digital ionograms	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE												This paper introduces a methodology to autonomously identify and classify ionospheric sporadic E layers (E-s) from digital ionograms acquired using a NOAA dynasonde operated at the Bear Lake Observatory (BLO) in northern Utah. This approach uses a windowed-fuzzy clustering technique to group ionospheric echoes present in digital ionograms, employing the transitive property of equivalence. The algorithm introduces a variance constraint to automatically determine the number and size of the clusters present in the data set. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the cluster shapes is employed for curvature estimation and to enable classification of the data into the four principal types of temperate latitude sporadic E. A visual evaluation of the autonomously classified ionograms suggests that the algorithm accurately identifies similar to 95% of the sporadic E echoes present in the BLO data set. The paper also includes a "proof-of-concept" analysis of the methodology, deriving Es parameters for summer and winter intervals, that explicitly characterizes the diurnal and seasonal variations present in the E region at 42 degrees N. This analysis was derived from approximately 34,000 digital ionograms acquired over 4 months. While the experimental data show lower peak E region heights than predicted by modeling studies, they are generally consistent with GPS satellite occultation measurements. Our analysis of the temporal variation of f(o)E during summer and winter intervals is inconsistent with previous results that suggest a seasonal E region density anomaly. The results confirm, however, the ionospheric effect of increased NO densities in both the summer and winter E region, as predicted by modeling studies. The identification of sporadic E using the approach outlined in this work markedly facilitates the analysis of E-s parameters, as well as eliminating any human biases from the ionogram analysis process.

Dive characteristics of Common Loons wintering in the Gulf of Mexico and off the southern US Atlantic coast	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												Common Loons (Gavia immer) winter primarily in marine coastal areas and utilize a forage base that is poorly defined, especially for offshore areas. Information on dive activity is needed for describing foraging strategies and for inferring prey distribution. Archival geolocator tags were used to determine the wintering locations and dive characteristics of adult Common Loons captured and marked on breeding lakes in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Among loons that completed fall migration, most wintered in the Gulf of Mexico, with smaller proportions wintering off the southern Atlantic Coast or impoundments in the southeastern United States. Adult Common Loons tended to occupy offshore areas of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean and, on average, spent about 60% of daylight hours foraging. Dive depths were as deep as 50 m (Gulf of Mexico) and dive characteristics indicated that loons were primarily foraging on benthic prey. Total dive duration, time at maximum depth, and post -dive surface intervals increased with dive depths among wintering Common Loons. Our results are expected to contribute to the understanding of the wintering ecology of Common Loons and be useful in informing regional and national conservation planning efforts.

Predicting Effects of Water Regime Changes on Waterbirds: Insights from Staging Swans	PLOS ONE												Predicting the environmental impact of a proposed development is notoriously difficult, especially when future conditions fall outside the current range of conditions. Individual-based approaches have been developed and applied to predict the impact of environmental changes on wintering and staging coastal bird populations. How many birds make use of staging sites is mostly determined by food availability and accessibility, which in the case of many waterbirds in turn is affected by water level. Many water systems are regulated and water levels are maintained at target levels, set by management authorities. We used an individual-based modelling framework (MORPH) to analyse how different target water levels affect the number of migratory Bewick's swans Cygnus columbianus bewickii staging at a shallow freshwater lake (Lauwersmeer, the Netherlands) in autumn. As an emerging property of the model, we found strong non-linear responses of swan usage to changes in water level, with a sudden drop in peak numbers as well as bird-days with a 0.20 m rise above the current target water level. Such strong non-linear responses are probably common and should be taken into account in environmental impact assessments.					; Gyimesi, Abel/F-8604-2010; Nolet, Bart/C-1416-2008; Stillman, Richard/B-6018-2009; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012	Nolet, Bart/0000-0002-7437-4879; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X													1932-6203					FEB 10	2016	11	2							e0147340	10.1371/journal.pone.0147340	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0147340								26862895					WOS:000370046600026

It was concluded that these compounds are weakly bound subunits of the macromolecules, which are liberated on elution with distilled water. The macromolecules were not stable in the dark. Exposing them to daylight in the laboratory and to sunlight in quartz bottles enhanced conversion. During 6 week''s exposure to weakly photolytic conditions (daylight > 300 nm), organic carbon of the high molecular bulk substances decreased by 15% (winter) and by 25% (summer), while the concentrations of the apparent low molecular weight substances increased accordingly. Such a slow but continuous transformation may reduce also the in situ persistence of the macromolecules gradually.																			0036-7842					DEC 30	1985	47	1					21	26		10.1007/BF02538181	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02538181													WOS:A1985AXN8200003

We combine a detailed satellite-based record of seasonal lake evolution in Dronning Maud Land with a high-resolution simulation from the regional climate model Mod & egrave;le Atmosph & eacute;rique R & eacute;gional to identify drivers of lake variability between 2014 and 2021. Correlations between summer lake extents and climate parameters reveal complex relationships that vary both in space and time. Shortwave radiation contributes positively to the energy budget during summer melt seasons, but summers with enhanced longwave radiation are more prone to surface melting and ponding, which is further enhanced by advected heat from summer precipitation. In contrast, previous winter precipitation has a negative effect on summer lake extents, presumably by increasing albedo and pore space, delaying the accumulation of meltwater. Downslope katabatic or f & ouml;hn winds promote ponding around the grounding zones of some ice shelves. At a larger scale, we find that summers during periods of negative southern annular mode are associated with increased ponding in Dronning Maud Land. The high variability in seasonal lake extents indicates that these ice shelves are highly sensitive to future warming or intensified extreme events.

In this study, we analyzed multiannual variability, determined long-term trends and detected changes in the frequency of extreme events in the surface water temperature (LSWT) of Lake Peipsi (Estonia/Russia) for nearly seven decades (1950-2018) and aimed to trace how the LSWT responded to the climate change. Dynamic water temperature parameters were calculated using the smoothed water temperature curve fitted to daily water temperatures. Our results showed that, although the average LSWT did not increase significantly on an annual basis since 1950 it rose rapidly in the winter season during the last decade (similar to +0.5 degrees C). Ice formation exhibited a marked (similar to 15 days) delay since 2007 resulting in a longer open water period. Extreme LSWT events did not occur more frequently. We noticed however significant fluctuating in winter LSWT in time series, starting from 2007 and also causing an increase in stochasticity. The consequences of the on-going winter warming and changes of ice cover phenology are expected to be crucial for Lake Peipsi ecosystem functioning and impact on lake biota, especially temperature-sensitive native fishes.

Seasonal and inter-annual variability of phytoplankton in central Lake Diefenbaker (Saskatchewan, Canada) proximal to a large commercial aquaculture farm	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake Diefenbaker, Saskatchewan, is a large reservoir (392 km(2)) with multiple end users, including a commercial aquaculture farm, which rely on sustainable water quality. Phytoplankton samples were taken monthly at upstream, aquaculture, and downstream locations during August 2008 to November 2011. The phytoplankton community was primarily diatoms and cryptophytes. Diatom biomass was correlated with greater mixing depth, while cryptophyte biomass was correlated with higher dissolved nutrients. Phytoplankton biomass was characterized by date, season and year, and this information was used to test spatial differences between upstream, farm and downstream locations. There was no significant difference in chlorophyte, chrysophyte or dinoflagellate biomass spatially. Upstream sites (US) had higher diatom biomass in the fall (US-DS = 329 mg/m(3)). Downstream sites (DS) had higher cryptophyte biomass in the summer (DS-US = 241 mg/m(3)) and higher cyanobacteria biomass in the fall (DS-US = 15 mg/m(3)). Spatial trends in diatoms, cryptophytes, and cyanobacteria between upstream and downstream locations were found to be significantly related to distance downstream, but failed to provide evidence of a fish farm effect. There was far greater inter-annual variability than spatial variability in phytoplankton biomass of Lake Diefenbaker, a lake prone to flooding and drought. For instance, flooding in 2011 resulted in elevated suspended solids, nutrient concentrations, and algal biomass (particularly cryptophytes and dinoflagellates) due to a La Nina winter. Flood inputs of suspended solids to Lake Diefenbaker favour low-light adapted taxa (e.g., Rhodomonas minuta Skuja) over potentially toxic cyanobacteria.

Benthic algal biomass accrual rates exhibited significant (p = 0.019, repeated measures ANOVA) seasonal differences; rates were greatest in summer and least in winter. The degree of nutrient limitation also differed (p = 0.003) seasonally; periphyton community biomass was most responsive to nutrient amendments in summer and least responsive in winter. Temperature may be the underlying cause of these patterns. The ratios of dissolved inorganic nitrogen to soluble reactive phosphorus (DIN:SRP) in streamwater and of streambed periphyton communities were of limited use for predicting which nutrient limited NDS bioassays; cellular nutrient content was weakly predictive This study demonstrates the need to consider temporal changes (i.e, seasonality) when assessing the influence of nutrients on stream ecosystems, and indicates that the use of nutrient ratios to ascertain which nutrient may limit benthic algal biomass should be validated with field experiments.

The maximum number of macrozoobenthos on the littoral was recorded in spring, maximal biomass - in summer; Maximum sublittoral abundance and biomass of macrozoobenthos were recorded in the summer.																			2520-2138						2017	7	3					56	63		10.15421/2017_49	http://dx.doi.org/10.15421/2017_49													WOS:000418742000006
J	Haaparanta, A; Valtonen, ET; Hoffmann, RW				Haaparanta, A; Valtonen, ET; Hoffmann, RW			Gill anomalies of perch and roach from four lakes differing in water quality	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												This study examined gill anomalies of two common freshwater fish species, roach Rutilus rutilus and perch Perca fluviatilis, collected over five seasons in 1989-1990 from four lakes in central Finland. The lakes differed both in water quality and in fish parasite species composition. Particular attention was paid to the differences in chloride cell proliferation. Gill anomalies were generally more common and abundant in roach than in perch. Chloride cell proliferation was the most frequent histological change in roach but was that least often found in perch. Most of the changes were systemic and light in severity. In perch an unidentified lesion of noncellular eosinophilic inclusions in an enlarged epithelium was also recorded. There was a marked pattern in the severity of histological changes in perch when comparing those from the natural Lake Peurunka to those from three 'altered' lakes. Gills of perch from Lake Peurunka possessed more alterations in all the recorded parameters. In roach, a significant differences were detected in chloride cell and epithelial proliferation: these were greater in Lake Peurunka and 'polluted' Lake Vatia. In perch, all histological changes were significantly more frequent at the end of autumn 1989 when compared to other seasons. In roach, increased frequencies of all gill changes were noted in winter and spring samples. Tissue reactions to parasites were either only localized or absent. The systemic gill alterations in freshwater fish may reflect the soft nature and low winter temperature of Finnish fresh waters, in which chemical imbalances, such as acid peaks, may induce more dramatic changes in fish tissues than in harder waters.

We studied two boreal lakes (Kuivajarvi and Vendyurskoe) with different water clarity during three years representing a gradient of meteorological forcing. The lakes are located in the same climatic region and have a similar depth, but, because of the difference in water transparency, they responded differently to the weather fronts. Long spring overturn and relatively cold summer resulted in weak stratification and well-oxygenated water column in both lakes. However, in dark-water Kuivajarvi, the hypolimnion was unusually warm leading to high production rate of CO2. Warm summer had the most dramatic impact on clear-water lake Vendyurskoe changing its mixing regime from typical polymixis to dimixis, leading to strong oxygen depletion and ensuing anoxia. In dimictic dark-water Kuivajarvi, hot spring resulted in early onset of stratification with ensuing low hypolimnetic temperatures and persistent oxygen depletion. These results indicate that climate warming will increase the risk of occurrence of deep water anoxia.

Gradients in turbidity developed during winter and spring due to high suspended loads, which settled primarily in the headwater region. Gradients in apparent deposition of allochthonous organic carbon and chlorophyll a also influenced detrital processing and hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen conditions. Hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen depletion started in May in the headwater region, due to a high volumetric dissolved oxygen demand, and spread slowly to the dam by winter. These patterns indicated that riverine inputs and deposition influenced biological activity along the longitudinal axis of the lake.

J	MOORE, JW				MOORE, JW			ZOOPLANKTON, AND RELATED PHYTOPLANKTON CYCLES, IN A EUTROPHIC LAKE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The seasonal cycles of zooplankton were determined for 18 consecutive months in a sewage-enriched lake in northern Canada and were related to algal availability and utilization, food consumption, temperature and the density of predators. Most of the common species (Daphnia pulex, D. middendorffiana, Keratella cochlearis, K. quadrata, Polyarthra vulgaris) increased in abundance in May and June, reached a mid-summer maximum and declined sharply in the fall. Phytoplankton densities increased sharply in May, peaked early in June and gradually decreased through the summer and fall. Since the quantity of algae in the guts remained constant during this period, algal availability and utilization had no direct impact on the seasonal cycles of any species. The amount of ingested material in D. pulex and D. middendorffiana was similar regardless of time of year, implying that the total quantity of food in the environment did not restrict development. Temperature was the most important factor influencing variations in the densities of all species; predation by Cyclops spp. probably had little effect on the population dynamics of the fauna.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1980	74	2					99	104		10.1007/BF00014560	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00014560													WOS:A1980KL38800001
J	Kishcha, P; Starobinets, B				Kishcha, Pavel; Starobinets, Boris			Spatial Heterogeneity in Dead Sea Surface Temperature Associated with Inhomogeneity in Evaporation	REMOTE SENSING												Spatial heterogeneity in Dead Sea surface temperature (SST) was pronounced throughout the daytime, based on METEOSAT geostationary satellite data (2005-2015). In summer, SST peaked at 13 LT (local time), when SST reached 38.1 degrees C, 34.1 degrees C, and 35.4 degrees C being averaged over the east, middle, and west parts of the lake, respectively. In winter, daytime SST heterogeneity was less pronounced than that in summer. As the characteristic feature of the diurnal cycle, the SST daily temperature range (the difference between daily maxima and minima) was equal to 7.2 degrees C, 2.5 degrees C, and 3.8 degrees C over the east, middle, and west parts of the Dead Sea, respectively, in summer, compared to 5.3 degrees C, 1.2 degrees C, and 2.3 degrees C in winter. In the presence of vertical water mixing, the maximum of SST should be observed several hours later than that of land surface temperature (LST) over surrounding land areas due to thermal inertia of bulk water. However, METEOSAT showed that, in summer, maxima of SST and LST were observed at the same time, 13 LT. This fact is evidence that there was no noticeable vertical water mixing. Our findings allowed us to consider that, in the absence of water mixing and under uniform solar radiation in the summer months, spatial heterogeneity in SST was associated with inhomogeneity in evaporation. Maximal evaporation (causing maximal surface water cooling) took place at the middle part of the Dead Sea, while minimum evaporation took place at the east side of the lake.					; Kishcha, Pavel/N-4696-2019	Kishcha, Pavel/0000-0002-2693-0914; 														2072-4292				JAN	2021	13	1							93	10.3390/rs13010093	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13010093													WOS:000606139100001

Atmospheric deposition of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in an urban and a suburban area of Korea from 2002 to 2004	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Atmospheric bulk samples (wet and dry) were collected monthly during 2002 to 2004 from an urban and a suburban area in Korea for assessment of depositional flux and seasonal variations in the concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAH depositional flux ranged from 64.1 to 610 mu g/m(2)/y for the urban area and from 65 to 460 mu g/m(2)/y for the suburban area. The fluxes of PAHs measured in this study were comparable with those reported for urban and suburban areas in other countries. The fluxes of particulates and PAHs were higher in winter than in summer, consistent with the greater per capita consumption of fossil fuel in winter than in summer. Ambient temperature played a major role in the seasonal variability in PAH fluxes. Photochemical degradation of PAHs appears to occur during the summer months. The relationship of PAH depositional fluxes with major air pollutants, such as ozone, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and presence of particulate matter up to 10 mu m in size (PM10), was also investigated. Dominant PAH compounds in both the urban and the suburban locations were benzo[g,h,i]perylene, pyrene, and indeno[1,2,3-c,d]pyrene. Based on the PAH diagnostic ratios and a factor analysis, the major sources of PAHs in the urban and the suburban regions were found to be similar. Diesel exhaust, coal combustion, and gasoline emissions contributed predominantly to atmospheric PAH contamination.

J	HUTCHINSON, GE; SETLOW, JK				HUTCHINSON, GE; SETLOW, JK			LIMNOLOGICAL STUDIES IN CONNECTICUT .8. THE NIACIN CYCLE IN A SMALL INLAND LAKE	ECOLOGY												The nicotinic acid in soln. in the surface water of Linsley Pond, a small eutrophic lake, varies from 0.15 [gamma] to 0.89 [gamma] per liter; values over 0.7 [gamma] per liter occur only when ice is present or is breaking up. Summer values do not exceed 0.41 [gamma] 1. Nicotinic acid in suspension varies from 0.05 [gamma] to 0.87 [gamma] per 1. and is probably largely present in phytoplankton, which apparently contains 50 to over 100 [gamma] per grain. Vertical variations in nicotinic acid content during summer stagnation depend on the vertical variation of suspended nicotinic acid, soluble nicotinic acid not accumulating in the cold hypolimnetic water. The dissolved biotin in Linsley Pond water probably varies from 0.0003 [gamma] to 0.004 [gamma] per 1., and the sestonic biotin over the same general range. The nicotinic acid and biotin contents of the water of Bantam Lake are of the same order of magnitude as in Linsley Pond. No antibiotic substances, active against bacteria, could be detected in either lake at the end of the spring phytoplankton maximum. The decomposition of nicotinic acid in lakes probably follows a course similar to its bacterial decomposition in soils. If auxo-heterotrophic phytoplankters occur in lakes they will probably prove, like Ditylum brightwelli in the sea, to be winter forms.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1946	27	1					13	22		10.2307/1931013	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1931013													WOS:A1946XX03800002

Environmental controls on the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Nodularia spumigena in a temperate lagoon system in SE Australia	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Estuarine blooms of N-2-fixing cyanobacteria are rare, and the factors controlling them remain poorly understood outside the Baltic Sea. We measured in situ physico-chemical conditions and undertook nutrient-addition bioassays and dilution-based grazing experiments fortnightly over the 2010 to 2011 Austral spring-summer-autumn, to evaluate the role of physical environmental drivers, grazing and macronutrients on the growth of Nodularia spumigena Mertens (hereafter Nodularia) in a temperate lagoon system (Gippsland Lakes, Australia). Nodularia appeared in late summer, following a period of warm weather (water temperature > 22 degrees C), high solar exposure, calm conditions, relatively low salinity (<22) and low dissolved inorganic nitrogen (similar to 0.4 mu mol l(-1)). A major bloom did not eventuate. Bioassays indicated N limitation prior to Nodularia appearing, and P limitation after, while in situ nutrient concentrations indicated N limitation throughout. Nodularia grew rapidly (similar to 0.4 d(-1)) in control bioassays (no nutrients added), whereas other phytoplankton taxa showed zero or negative growth. N addition caused significantly lower Nodularia growth, while other taxa had higher growth. P addition did not significantly enhance Nodularia growth. This suggests Nodularia was able to obtain P from the water column and from phytoplankton breakdown. A reduction in grazing pressure via dilution led to lower growth rates of Nodularia and higher growth rates of other phytoplankton taxa. This suggests that the grazers selectively consumed taxa other than Nodularia, and that grazing positively influences Nodularia growth in this system. These data indicate that Nodularia growth was limited in situ by physical conditions (primarily solar radiation) and that nutrients and grazing were of second order importance.

J	Sacco, AG; Bergmann, FB; Ruim, AM				Sacco, Anne Gomes; Bergmann, Fabiane Borba; Ruim, Ana Maria			Bird assemblages in the urban area in the city of Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.	BIOTA NEOTROPICA												Urbanization causes changes in the composition and diversity of biotic communities. The goals of this work are to present a list of bird species that use the urban area in the city of Pelotas (RS), in the southernmost end of Brazil, and to describe the bird assemblages structure underlining the richness, composition, and relative abundance of species and their seasonal variability. Data collection took place between October 2007 and September 2008, at 216 fixed points, distributed in groups of 6 equidistant points at each 200 meters in streets with varied levels of urbanization, sampled once a season. The observer stayed for 8 minutes at each point, resulting in a sampling effort of 28.8 hours each season and 115.2 hours during the year. A total of 9,595 contacts of 84 bird species were found, belonging to 34 families and 14 orders. In regard to relative abundance, 72 species presented less than 200 contacts; 7 presented between 200 and 1,000; and 4 presented over 1,000 contacts. The species with more than 1,000 contacts were Furnarius rufus, Columba livia, Myiopsitta monachus, and Pitangus sulphuratus, accounting for 5,136 contacts. In all 84 species, 67 were present in less than 20% of the sampled points; 7 were registered at between 20-40% and between 40-60% of the points; and 3 were sighted at between 80-100% of the observation points. Species with the highest frequency of occurrence were P. sulphuratus, Passer domesticus, and F. rufus. Total richness ranged from 55 species in the fall to 61 in the winter. Of the 84 species, 21 were present in 1 season, 17 in 2, 9 in 3, and 37 were present in all four seasons. The season with the highest relative abundance was spring, with 2,936 contacts; the one with the least abundance was autumn, with 2,149 contacts. The bird assemblages presented a representative richness relative to the region, though very few species are abundant and well distributed. Such pattern may be a reflection of the low quality and heterogeneity of the urban matrix, which has few parks and green areas, no reserves with native vegetation and lakes, and a low degree of tree coverage.																			1676-0603					APR-JUN	2013	13	2					153	162		10.1590/S1676-06032013000200014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1676-06032013000200014													WOS:000323087100015

Quantitative palaeoclimate estimates for Early Miocene southern New Zealand: Evidence from Foulden Maar	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												A rich and diverse plant macrofossil assemblage from an earliest Miocene diatomite deposit in southern New Zealand provides a detailed record of mid-latitude, Southern Hemisphere terrestrial climate in an oceanic setting. Quantitative palaeoclimate estimates for temperature and precipitation variables were obtained using the Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program (CLAMP) and the Bioclimatic Analysis approach. In addition, the surface area of fossil Podocarpus travisiae leaves preserved at the site was used as a proxy for mean annual temperature. CLAMP and Bioclimatic analysis both estimated mean annual temperatures at similar to 18.5-19.5 degrees C, with a moderate seasonal temperature range between summer and winter of similar to 10 degrees C and leaf size in Podocarpus suggested a MAT of about 21 degrees C. Precipitation rates were high at around 1700-2000 mm per year. CLAMP analysis suggested a similar to 600 mm difference between the dry and wet season, whereas Bioclimatic Analysis indicated a similar to 200-250 mm difference between summer and winter. When compared to CLAMP analysis on modem vegetation on subtropical oceanic islands, it would seem that CLAMP overestimates seasonal precipitation differences. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Evaluating the use of an established invasive species to predict the movement of an encroaching invader	ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY												The susceptibility of ecosystems to range expansions of invasive species must be predicted. Silver carps (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) threaten the uninvaded Great Lakes and other aquatic ecosystems throughout North America. Invasive common carps (Cyprinus carpio) already occur throughout the continent in rivers and lakes where silver carps may invade. Movement and habitat use of common carps may inform predictions about how silver carps use new environments. Acoustic telemetry combined with stationary receivers and active tracking were used to simultaneously compare movement probability, movement rate, and extent of movement including dam passages of both species in the upper Illinois River during summer 2019 through fall 2021. Common carps had larger core ranges, whereas silver carps moved longer distances. Environmental cues affecting the timing of spring movement were similar between the fishes. Habitat selection during summer was similar between the species only during one year. Both fish species passed through lock and dam complexes at similar times, although common carps used lock chambers and silver carps moved through gates. Because silver carps are likely to spread much farther and faster than common carps due to their greater seasonal movement, a more migratory species should be explored to determine whether the movements of such fishes inform future long-distance silver carp dispersal. Management for control of common carp and silver carp requires different tactics for targeting habitat for harvest control and perhaps design and use of barriers.																				2050-3385				OCT 15	2025	13	1							33	10.1186/s40317-025-00430-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40317-025-00430-4													WOS:001594104000001

The number of mink declined whereas number of polecats was stable during 1995-2000, however, except during one winter, mink were always more abundant in the study area than polecats. Significant differences in habitat utilization between radio-collared mink and polecats were observed. Mink moved only along the lake shoreline and showed no seasonal shift in habitat selection. In winter, polecats were most frequently located close to the lake banks, but they also stayed in barns and stables. In spring, they moved further from the lakes. There was considerable interspecies overlap of mink and polecat home ranges in February, and common use of the banks of the 500 m long unfrozen canal was recorded for 4 mink and 5 polecats. The pattern of daily activity of polecat and mink differed: mink were most active at dawn and in early morning whereas polecats at dusk and in beginning of the night. Individuals of both species coexisted in this small area at relatively high densities and to some degree exploited the same habitats, particularly in the vicinity of sites with access to open water.

In the present study, 112 water samples collected from 14 lakes and 11 drinking water source sites in Wuhan were detected for the residues of OCPs in November 2013 and July 2014, respectively. The I OCPs pound ranged from 5.61 to 13.62 ng L-1 in summer with the maximum value in Yezhi Lake and 3.18 to 7.73 ng L-1 in winter with the highest concentration in Yandong Lake. Except dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), OCP concentrations in summer were significantly higher than those in winter mostly due to the non-point source pollution including land runoff in summer. Source apportionment of hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and DDTs revealed the historical use of technical HCH and lindane and the new input of DDT, respectively. The spatial distribution of OCPs was not uniform in the surface water of Wuhan because of the significant influence of land development and fishery. The risk assessments showed the heptachlor, and heptachlor epoxide in most sampling sites exceeded the threshold set by the European Union, indicating the possible adverse effects for aquatic lives. Negligible non-carcinogenic risks for drinking and bathing as well as carcinogenic risks for bathing were found in the surface water. However, the total carcinogenic risks of all OCPs (aRs) caused by drinking in summer were higher than the safe level of 10(-7) in all sampling sites. It was implied that the surface water in Wuhan was not safe for directly drinking without effective purification.					; Wei, LiangFu/HTQ-5770-2023; Wang, Jun/AAN-4446-2021	Wei, Liangfu/0000-0002-8323-1001; Wang, Jun/0000-0002-7574-9468													0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2017	24	2					1975	1986		10.1007/s11356-016-7956-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-7956-7								27798806					WOS:000394254000081

However, the forcing mechanism of the 4.2 ka event remains unclear, with current evidence being divided between high-latitude and low-latitude forcings. The Asian climate system contains strong summer and winter monsoon circulations, and thus the region is ideal for studying high- and lowlatitude climate forcings on 4.2 ka event. In this study, we present a high-resolution pollen record of the past 5000 years from Wudalianchi Crater Lake in northeastern China in the East Asian monsoon region. An evident decrease in broadleaf trees occurred during the 4.2 ka event, suggesting a decrease in summer monsoon rainfall. Well-dated high-resolution pollen, stalagmite 818O, and winter monsoon records were collected to study the possible transportation of high- and low-latitude signals. Most of the pollen records showed significant changes during the 4.2 ka event, while no apparent change was found in winter monsoon records. Meanwhile, more obvious changes in stalagmite 818O records were observed in lower- rather than the higher-latitude regions around 4.2 ka.

The Effect of Natural and Anthropogenic Factors on the Seasonal Ecohydrological Dynamics of the Eastern Basin of the Hypersaline Sakskoe Lake, the Republic of Crimea	WATER RESOURCES												Crimean salt lakes have a high resource potential used in various types of human activity, i.e., balneology, chemical industry, and therapy; now, they are attractive tourist sites. A combination of biotic and abiotic factors creates specific conditions for the development and functioning of biota and the formation of unique ionic composition of brine and bottom sediments, which are used in balneology and the production of spa-products. Sakskoe Lake is among the largest coastal salt lakes of Crimea, located on the southwestern coast of the Black Sea. The effect of climate conditions and biota caused the formation of a specific ecosystem in the lake, which has a peculiar ionic composition of brine, changing within the year, and a brine shrimp population. The concentrations of cations and anions in the brine increased in summer because of active evaporation and decreased in winter and spring because of dilution of atmospheric precipitation and snowmelt water. The dynamics of the brine population also showed characteristic seasonal features: the life cycle begins in April, the maximal number of various life stages is recorded in May-June, and the end, in November-December. The artificial regulation of the water-salt regime of the water body through addition of seawater in summer contributed to maintaining optimal conditions, thus ensuring a high vital activity of the biota. The obtained data can reflect the seasonal dynamics of processes in the salt lake, governed by climatic, seasonal, and anthropogenic factors.																			0097-8078	1608-344X				FEB	2023	50	1					130	139		10.1134/S009780782301013X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S009780782301013X													WOS:000978165300012

Diagnosing Discrepancies between Observations and Models of Surface Energy Fluxes in a Midlatitude Lake	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												The physical processes of heat exchange between lakes and the surrounding atmosphere are important in simulating and predicting terrestrial surface energy balance. Latent and sensible heat fluxes are the dominant physical process controlling ice growth and decay on the lake surface, as well as having influence on regional climate. While one-dimensional lake models have been used in simulating environmental changes in ice dynamics and water temperature, understanding the seasonal to daily cycles of lake surface energy balance and its relationship to lake thermal properties, atmospheric conditions, and how those are represented in models is still an open area of research. We evaluated a pair of one-dimensional lake models, Freshwater Lake (FLake) and the General Lake Model (GLM), to compare modeled latent and sensible heat fluxes against observed data collected by an eddy covariance tower during a 1-yr period in 2017, using Lake Mendota in Madison, Wisconsin, as our study site. We hypothesized transitional periods of ice cover as a leading source of model uncertainty, and we instead found that the models failed to simulate accurate values for large positive heat fluxes that occurred from late August into late December. Our results ultimately showed that one-dimensional models are effective in simulating sensible heat fluxes but are considerably less sensitive to latent heat fluxes than the observed relationships of latent heat flux to environmental drivers. These results can be used to focus future improvement of these lake models especially if they are to be used for surface boundary conditions in regional numerical weather models. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: While lakes consist of a small amount of Earth's surface, they have a large impact on local climate and weather. A large amount of energy is stored in lakes during the spring and summer, and then removed from lakes before winter. The effect is particularly noticeable in high latitudes, when the seasonal temperature difference is larger. Modeling this lake energy exchange is important for weather models and measuring this energy exchange is challenging. Here we compare modeled and observed energy exchange, and we show there are large amounts of energy exchange happening in the fall, which models struggle to capture well. During periods of partial ice coverage in early winter, lake behavior can change rapidly.

J	George, DG; Maberly, SC; Hewitt, DP				George, DG; Maberly, SC; Hewitt, DP			The influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation on the physical, chemical and biological characteristics of four lakes in the English Lake District	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Thirty-six years of winter meteorological and limnological measurements from four lakes in the English Lake District are analysed and related to variations in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Winter weather conditions were strongly influenced by the NAO with mild, wet winters being associated with strongly positive values of the NAO index (NAOI). 2. Lake surface and bottom temperatures were strongly positively correlated with the NAOI, with the highest correlations being recorded in the shallower lakes. 3. Variations in the NAOI also had a significant effect on the winter concentration of nitrate. In all the lakes, there was a significant negative correlation between the NAOI and the detrended winter concentration of nitrate. The key driving variable was the local air temperature, which appeared to limit the quantity of nitrate reaching the lake by increasing the amount assimilated in the surrounding catchment in mild winters. 4. Dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) concentrations were not significantly correlated with the NAOI in the two larger basins but significant positive correlations were recorded in the two smaller lakes. The key driving variable was the local rainfall with higher DRP concentrations being recorded after heavy rain in the lakes with a short retention time. 5. The NAOI-related changes in rainfall also influenced the phytoplankton. In wet winters the concentration of chlorophyll in the two smaller lakes with the shortest retention time was lower and the spring growth of Asterionella formosa was delayed in the smallest lake. 6. These differential responses demonstrate how the large-scale effects associated with the NAO can be 'filtered' by the physical characteristics of a particular site.

Movements and habitat use of the Rocky Mountain Population of trumpeter swans	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The Rocky Mountain Population (RMP) of trumpeter swans Cygnus buccinator (hereafter, swans) in North America includes breeders in the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) and other western states (together, United States segment) and western provinces of Canada (Canada segment). Conservation concern for the United States segment stems from its slow population growth and the resident nature of GYA swans, which intermingle with migrating Canada segment swans in wintering habitats. Thus, understanding variation in migratory behavior and habitat use by swans in the two population segments can inform how management actions may affect the RMP. We used telemetry data from 55 RMP swans captured in the western United States to understand their movements and habitat use. For 45 swans (60 swan-years) that spent the summer in the United States, distance traveled between breeding and wintering areas ranged from 0 km (i.e., no migration in 22% of swan-years) to 473 km, with an average of nonzero movements of 118 +/- 95 km (SD). Swans traveled farther distances when maximum temperatures were lower. For 10 swans (16 swan-years) that spent the summer in Canada, five appeared to molt but not to nest, and four appeared to nest in one or more years. Migration timing was similar for molting and nesting swans. All five molting swans and one nesting swan spent at least one previous summer in the GYA. Migratory connectivity of all birds was weaker in years when more swans migrated to Canada for the summer. During the breeding season, Canada swans used low-elevation lakes, but United States swans used high-elevation lakes. Both groups of swans increased use of crop fields outside of the breeding season. Our study shows interchange between the United States and Canada segments, a finding that challenges the efficacy of existing population designations. Furthermore, variation in movement behavior of GYA swans suggests possible actions, such as restoring winter habitats to increase swan distribution and migration, to support swan conservation.

Winter thermal structure across the Laurentian Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The formation of winter stratification and thermal structure in general across the Great Lakes varies in character not just between lakes, but interannually within individual lakes. Three large datasets comprise all of the publicly available Great Lakes water temperature data that span both the winter and the entire water column. Multiple sites and multiple years of data are available for Lake Superior, as well as multiple years in Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, 2 years in Lake Ontario at multiple sites, and a single year at two sites in Lake Erie. The lakes show diverse manifestations of winter stratification, with Lake Superior reliably forming winter stratification, Lake Michigan rarely forming stratification, and Huron forming stratification in about half of the winters for which data are available (there is not enough data to evaluate this for Erie and Ontario). Whether a lake forms stratification or not in a given year is governed by how much heat a lake loses below the temperature of maximum density; a heat content of roughly -1 GJm- 2 relative to the temperature of maximum density appears to be a threshold for the formation of winter stratification. Minimum heat content in a given year is a strong function of average winter air temperature. When combined with a historical database of basin-wide air temperature, the winter stratification threshold can be used to hindcast stratification formation in Superior, Huron, and Michigan over the last century, showing that Michigan and Huron are currently undergoing a climate-driven shift in stratification status.

Even though the data collected may not be sufficient for a precise description of persistent organic pollutant release patterns from glacier melting, they have, however, highlighted the potential for surface water contamination. Concentrations were of the same order of magnitude in all glacial streams, indicating comparable contamination levels in different glaciers of the alpine region. OC levels in nonglacial springs sampled in the same areas are usually lower. Even if differences during the melting season (from spring to autumn) have been identified, a regular seasonal pattern in OC concentrations was not observed. Risk for the aquatic environment is excluded through direct water exposure, but it is likely to occur through biomagnification and secondary poisoning exposure. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Predicting hydrological impacts of the Yangtze-to-Huaihe Water Diversion Project on habitat availability for wintering waterbirds at Caizi Lake	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Quantifying the relationship between hydrological regime and habitat availability is the first step to predict potential impacts of water engineering projects on waterbirds, particularly in periodically flooded wetlands. The proposed Yangtze-to-Huaihe Water Diversion Project (YHWD) cuts through Caizi Lake, which is of international importance for wintering waterbirds. In order to explore the potential impacts of the project on habitat availability for the wintering waterbirds, we first built linear models to fit relationships between land cover patterns and water level dynamics in the lake, and then used generalized linear mixed models to test effects of habitat variables (water area, grassland area and mudflat area) on bird abundances of different functional groups. The avian habitat use differed among guilds, and was correlated with the land cover pattern, which was strongly dependent on seasonal water level fluctuations. Following water recession in autumn, the exposure of riparian habitats was more prominent in the eastern part of the lake, where the channel of the proposed YHWD project is located. This part of the lake is also where we located most of the important bird areas. Compared to the current situation, 54.3% of the grassland and 60.5% of the mudflats are predicted to be lost during winter due to the projected water level rise, resulting in reduced habitat availability for grass foragers, invertebrate eaters and tuber feeders. In order to mitigate potential impacts of the YHWD project, we suggest habitat compensations by construction of artificial habitats, and maintenance of water level regime at the whole lake by restoring similarity in water level fluctuations between Xizi Lake and Caizi Lake.					li, chunlin/KFS-0761-2024														0301-4797	1095-8630				NOV 1	2019	249								109251	10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.07.022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.07.022								31401449					WOS:000492797500003

Seasonal changes in the biomass, distribution, and patchiness of zooplankton and fish in four lakes in the Sierra Nevada, California	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Zooplankton are important components of lentic ecosystems, affecting phytoplankton, water clarity, and nutrient cycling, as well as transferring primary production to upper trophic levels. Many of these processes are temporally and spatially heterogeneous, but are difficult to observe at fine scales with traditional sampling methods. High-resolution sampling has been especially rare in remote and high-altitude lakes. We measured the vertical distribution of zooplankton and fish in four lakes in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California, U.S.A. (Independence Lake, Lake Tahoe, Cherry Lake, and Lake Eleanor) using a dual-frequency echosounder, and estimated lake-wide biomass in all lakes except Tahoe. For zooplankton, we also quantified trends and patchiness in their horizontal distribution. In two of the lakes, Cherry and Eleanor, surveys were repeated four times at seasonal intervals between autumn 2013 and autumn 2014. Zooplankton were most abundant in these lakes in the spring and summer of 2014, with peak wet-weight biomasses estimated at 31,000 kg in Lake Eleanor in April and 68,000 kg in Cherry Lake in June. The biomass and vertical distribution of fish also varied, increasing and moving shallower in the water column in June in both Cherry Lake and Lake Eleanor. Zooplankton density was not horizontally homogeneous, displaying gradients at the lake basin scale (5-6 km), and nested patchiness at a range of smaller scales (0-2 km). This small-scale spatial variability may be generated biologically, not physically. While it is well-known that the distribution of zooplankton is often patchy, this aspect of their ecology has not been quantified in most lakes, especially in remote montane locations. These results illustrate how acoustic sampling can rapidly and simultaneously measure the biomass and spatial distribution of multiple trophic levels in small lakes. This capability provides unique opportunities to study the processes that generate and maintain gradients and patchiness in these components of the ecosystem.

J	Stockner, J; Langston, A; Sebastian, D; Wilson, G				Stockner, J; Langston, A; Sebastian, D; Wilson, G			The limnology of Williston Reservoir: British Columbia's largest lacustrine ecosystem	WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA												In surface area, Williston Reservoir is British Columbia's largest lacustrine ecosystem. The reservoir shows remarkably little spatiotemporal variance among its three major reaches (Finlay, Parsnip and Peace), despite the immensity and biogeoclimatic diversity of its drainage basins. Williston is ultra-oligotrophic with average concentrations of total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) ranging from 3 to 5 mu g/L and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) from 60 to 65 mu g/L. The pelagic plankton community of Williston Reservoir is dominated by bacteria, pico-cyanobacteria, nano-flagellates and small diatoms, and the zooplankton community is comprised largely of copepods in spring and small cladocerans in summer and fall. Primary production rates are very low and most carbon is produced by the pico- and nano-sized plankters that appear to be primarily light limited due to high turbidity and frequent wind-mixing episodes, i.e., shallow light compensation depth and deep epilimnetic depth. Microbial food webs are predominant in Williston through much of the growing season, with free-living bacteria and pico-cyanobacteria as the primary carbon template, and nano-flagellates, ciliates and micro-zooplankton as the principal grazers. Loading models indicate that after impoundment in 1968, Williston was initially a moderately productive ecosystem, but the system has progressively lost nutrients, namely P, through sedimentation and outflow, but also by the scarcity of littoral carbon production due to severe water level fluctuations (drawdown) and winter ice-scouring. Hence, within the past 2 to 3 decades the ecosystem has gradually lost biogenic productive capacity and now lies within the ultra-oligotrophic trophic status and supports a low level of fish production. Daily rates of carbon production are presently at levels more typical of British Columbia fast-flushing, ultra-oligotrophic coastal ecosystems than large, interior-type oligo- and mesotrophic British Columbia lakes. Based on average values of most limnological variables we demonstrate that the Finlay Reach is currently the most productive region of Williston, and estimates of pelagic fish from hydroacoustic/trawl and gillnet surveys support this contention.																			1201-3080						2005	40	1					28	50		10.2166/wqrj.2005.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wqrj.2005.003													WOS:000228880800004

Specific knowledge of these preferences was needed to verify habitat criteria designed to assist in the management of water quality in this reservoir for trout survival in late summer and early fall. Rainbow trout exhibited temperature, dissolved oxygen, and depth preferences in the ranges 8.3-13.4 degreesC, 2.9-8.7 mg/L, and 30.0-52.0 m, respectively, while brown trout exhibited preferences in the ranges 7.5-21.9 degreesC, 4.2-10.0 mg/L, and 14.0-54.0 m, respectively. Even though rainbow trout selected cooler water temperatures and greater depths than brown trout. both species generally exhibited preferences for water 20 degreesC or cooler and containing 5.0 mg/L or more of dissolved oxygen. Maintenance of these criteria in Jocassee Reservoir should ensure adequate habitat for the summer and early fall survival of rainbow and brown trout.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				MAY	2004	24	2					735	740		10.1577/M03-019.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M03-019.1													WOS:000222067500041

The annual mean deposition fluxes of aerosol particles and 15 PAHs were 0.69 +/- 0.46 g/(m(2) x d) and 8.5 +/- 6.2 mu g/(m(2) x d), respectively. Phenanthrene, fluoranthene, pyrene, chrysene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, and benzo[k]fluoranthene were the dominant PAHs bound to deposited aerosol particles throughout the year. The total concentration of 15 PAHs in the deposited aerosol particles was the highest in winter but lowest in spring. The highest PAH concentration in the deposited aerosol particles in winter was because the heating processes highly increased the concentration in atmospheric aerosol particles. Low temperature and weak sunshine in winter reduced the degradation rate of deposited aerosol particle-bound PAHs, especially for those with low molecular weight. The lowest PAH concentration in deposited aerosol particles in spring resulted from the frequently occurring dust storms, which diluted PAH concentrations. The mean deposition flux of PAHs with aerosol particles in winter (16 mu g/[m(2) x d]) reached 3 times to 5 times that in other seasons (3.5-5.0 mu g/[m(2) x d]). The spatial variation of the deposition flux of PAHs with high molecular weight (e.g., benzo[a]pyrene) was consistent with their concentrations in the atmospheric aerosol particles, whereas such a phenomenon was not observed for those with low molecular weight (e.g., phenanthrene) because of their distinct hydrophobicity, Henry's law constant, and the spatially heterogeneous meteorological conditions.

Fouling of fishing nets in autumn during the open water period and in winter under the ice is a common phenomenon in large Finnish lakes where the water level is regulated. This fouling of fishing nets can sometimes be so extensive that fishing has to be stopped. Based on the practical experiences of fishermen, the main cause for the under-ice fouling has been proposed to be the winter draw-down of water causing low water level and stronger currents in lakes, but no conclusive relationship between fouling and water level regulation has yet been demonstrated. Here we show, using long-term winter data from a boreal lake and short-term netting experiments, that fouling of fishing nets results from increased water draw-down during winter (January March). Our results also show that fouling of fishing nets takes place only if the high water flow rates are accompanied by an intensive lowering of the water level. We also discuss the relevance of our results to other regulated lakes with ice cover.

Here we examine fluctuations in populations during the non-breeding season (autumn to spring) of seven waterbird species, which co-occur on 122 neighbouring water bodies in south-west Germany. We asked whether site-level abundance patterns can be predicted by weather variables, and whether these effects vary over months and years. We used a spatially explicit hidden Markov model to estimate the effects of local and regional movement on population fluctuations. Although the species varied in their dynamics, with different amounts of movement estimated between sites, several patterns were common across species: density effects were highly month-specific, but with little variation in the strength of effects over years. The abundance of most species was positively related to temperature, especially in winter. The common teal Anas crecca and common pochard Aythya ferina were the most site-fidelic species once they were present in the study area, but also exhibited the strongest regional migration. The mallard Anas platyrhynchos, tufted duck Aythya fuligula and great crested grebe Podiceps cristatus each behaved more like a single population, as individuals more frequently moved between sites and abundance fluctuations at sites were not explained by migratory movements alone. Our study shows that the strength of population parameters and environmental forces can be decomposed into monthly and yearly effects. Estimating the unknown origin and movement of individuals may show that commensurate populations of mobile species may have different underlying dynamics, while responding similarly to environmental factors.

Nemiah; Schubert, Carsten J.; Kahmen, Ansgar			Rapid atmospheric transport and large-scale deposition of recently synthesized plant waxes	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Sedimentary plant wax H-2/H-1 ratios are important tools for understanding hydroclimate and environmental changes, but large spatial and temporal uncertainties exist about transport mechanisms from ecosystem to sediments. To assess atmospheric pathways, we collected aerosol samples for two years at four locations within a similar to 60 km radius in northern Switzerland. We measured n-alkane distributions and H-2/H-1 ratios in these samples, and from local plants, leaf litter, and soil, as well as surface sediment from six nearby lakes. Increased concentrations and H-2 depletion of long odd chain n-alkanes in early summer aerosols indicate that most wax aerosol production occurred shortly after leaf unfolding, when plants synthesize waxes in large quantities. During autumn and winter, aerosols were characterized by degraded n-alkanes lacking chain length preferences diagnostic of recent biosynthesis, and H-2/H-1 values that were in some cases more than 100 parts per thousand higher than growing season values. Despite these seasonal shifts, modeled deposition-weighted average H-2/H-1 values of long odd chain n-alkanes primarily reflected summer values. This was corroborated by n-alkane H-2/H-1 values in lake sediments, which were similar to deposition-weighted aerosol values at five of six sites. Atmospheric deposition rates for plant n-alkanes on land were similar to 20% of accumulation rates in lakes, suggesting a role for direct deposition to lakes or coastal oceans near similar production sources, and likely a larger role for deposition on land and transport in river systems. This mechanism allows mobilization and transport of large quantities of recently produced waxes as fine-grained material to low energy sedimentation sites over short timescales, even in areas with limited topography. Widespread atmospheric transfer well before leaf senescence also highlights the importance of the isotopic composition of early season source water used to synthesize waxes for the geologic record.

These meadows follow a growth cycle closely tied to the seasonal hydrological fluctuation: as water levels recede in the fall, exposed mudflats provide habitat for Carex spp. growth. The seasonal growth of Carex overlaps the arrival of wintering geese and provides an important food source for the migrants. Recent alterations to the Yangtze's hydrology, however, have disrupted the synchronous relationship between water levels, Carex growth and wintering geese at Dongting Lake. In October 2012, we carried out an outdoor mesocosm experiment to investigate potential impacts of delayed water recession on the germination and growth of Carex heterolepis, the dominant Carex species at Dongting Lake, to understand how changes in hydrology might impact wintering goose habitat. Results showed that the delayed flood recession exerted significant impact on the first growth cycle of Carex growth. Prolonged inundation significantly lowered the intrinsic growth rate (P = 0.03) and maximum growth rates (P = 0.02). It also took significantly longer time to reach the peak growth rate (P = 0.04 and 0.05 for number of shoot and biomass, respectively). As a result, biomass accumulation was reduced by 45, 62 and 90 % for 10-day, 20-day and 30-day inundation treatments, respectively. These results indicate a severe risk of food shortage for wintering geese when water recession delayed. This potential risk should be taken into consideration when operating any hydrological control structures that alter the flood regimes in Dongting Lake.

To fill this gap, zooplankton community dynamics in the main stream, five tributaries and three reservoirs of the Yanhe River Basin (China) were studied in spring and autumn at the zooplankton functional group (ZFG) level. Principal component analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling were used to reveal the spatiotemporal characteristics of aquatic environmental and zooplankton community structure (ZCS), respectively. Subsequently, redundancy analysis and niche measures were conducted to explore the effects of environmental factors and biotic interactions on ZCS. Significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity in both aquatic environment and ZCS were found. Turbidity, total nitrogen, nitrite-nitrogen, chemical oxygen demand, pH, water depth, water temperature, and chlorophyll a emerged as primary environmental drivers of ZCS. Regarding biotic interactions, weak competition in spring contributed to the positive community succession, while in autumn, intense competition and predation between ZFGs, along with elimination of vulnerable groups, led to community instability. Niche processes emerged as significant shaping factors in the Yanhe River Basin' ZCS. Our study provides valuable insights into zooplankton community response to environmental changes and offers potential applications for understanding other aquatic organisms and ecosystems.					; 胡, 恩/GYU-3873-2022	Huang, Zhenyu/0000-0002-4790-3843; Yang, Zijie/0000-0002-5163-9766; Liu, Xinyuan/0000-0002-8393-660X													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2024	851	6					1353	1370		10.1007/s10750-023-05355-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-023-05355-8		SEP 2023											WOS:001066968500006

Using a Geographic Information System (GIS), we delineated watersheds with unique and homogeneous physical characteristics. Mean unfiltered total Hg (Hg-T) was higher in spring (7.94 ng L(-1)) than in fall (3.45 ng L(-1)). Major differences in Hg-T yields were observed among various land-use groupings. In wetland/forest watersheds, elevated Hg-T fluxes were associated with the filtered phase, while in agricultural watersheds, increased Hg-T fluxes were due to particle loading. Monomethylmercury (MeHg) yields from wetland/forest sites were higher than agricultural/forest sites and agricultural only sites. Percent wetland surface area was positively correlated with MeHg yield. These results identify the importance of land use and land cover in influencing Hg concentrations, speciaton, and transport in rivers.

Our main aims are to explore the regional variability and to compare these two surveys, separated by 14 years. The densities of three major benthic groups were considered: Oligochaeta, Tanypodinae and other Chironomidae (basically Chironominae with some Orthocladiinae). While differences between reservoirs were highly significant for all three groups, differences between basins were only reflected by chironomids. Differences between surveys depended on the benthic group and the season. Between 1973/75 and 1987/88, Oligochaeta densities halved significantly in winter (all basins), tanipodins increased 1.7-fold in summer (northern and central Spain), while other chironomids significantly increased 1.8-fold in summer (northern and central Spain) and 1.6-fold in winter (all basins). The increase in chironomids accompanied by the decrease in oligochaetes was partly attributed to better oxygen conditions in the last survey.

The structure of the zooplanktonic settlement was analyzed during one year in three Algerian reservoirs (lakes) with different geographical and climatic situation, in relation to abiotic factors (temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, suspended matter, carbonates, nitrogenized and phosphorated nutritive salts). A canonical correspondence analysis was used to estimate the influence of the abiotic factors on the temporal distribution. The studied lakes are located, on the one hand, in northern Algeria, in a sub-humid area (Lake Boukourdane) and, on the other hand, in the South of the country, in the arid region (Foum El Ghorza and Djorf Torba). Analysis of the environmental parameters indicates that there is a seasonal variation in the three reservoirs. In Lake Foum El Ghorza, the temperature and hydrology variations, linked with the arid climate, affects the concentration of dissolved oxygen, which strongly decreases (1.5 mg/l), involving a pH reduction; suspended matters are sometimes high, coming from the stripped catchment area, causing a turbidity in this not very deep lake. The study of the distribution of the species allowed us to highlight a seasonal temporal variation. Lake Boukourdane, in the sub-humid zone, has an increased specific richness (SR = 13). The various species evolve in alternation during the annual cycle. The representative species of this lake is Copidodiaptomus numidicus, characteristic of the rainy and endemic zone of the western Mediterranean; it is dominant (67%) in the spring. The Stenothermal species Diaphanosoma brachyurum, endemic of hot waters, is common to the two lakes; it evolves particularly in the summer (51.3%) at Boukourdane, whereas it is perennial and dominant (55%) in the spring at Djorf Torba. The specific richness is lower in Djorf Torba (SR = 7) and in Foum El Ghorza (SR = 6). The species collected in these two lakes are common and cosmopolitan, but they are adapted to the extreme. conditions of the arid climate. Nevertheless, the species evolving in Lake Foum El Ghorza have undergone a significant decline, which has reduced the number of species and their density in the summer-autumn period. Thus, we can say that in the studied lakes, the hydrological factors and the temperature related to the Mediterranean climate would be two of the principal causes of the temporal distribution of the species.																			1631-0691					SEP	2008	331	9					692	702		10.1016/j.crvi.2008.06.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crvi.2008.06.003								18722989					WOS:000259290200008

One hundred twenty-six surface water samples and 126 surface sediment samples were collected in winter 2012 and summer 2013, respectively, to investigate distribution patterns, seasonal variations, possible pollution sources, and potential ecological risks of 16 priority PAHs in the largest urban lake, East Lake in China. The total concentrations of 16 PAHs in water and sediment ranged from 10.2 to 525.1 ng L-1 and 10.9 to 2478.1 ng g(-1) dry weight, respectively. The concentrations of EPAHs in sediment samples in summer were almost two times greater than those in winter, but the seasonal variations did not differ significantly in the water samples. Diagnostic ratios of indicator PAHs reflected a possibility of pyrolytic PAH input in sediment and a mixture of petroleum and combustion sources in water from the East Lake. The potential ecological risk assessment based on the risk quotient indicated relatively moderate ecological risks of PAHs in the East Lake.

Environmental Controls of Diffusive and Ebullitive Methane Emissions at a Subdaily Time Scale in the Littoral Zone of a Midlatitude Shallow Lake	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Environmental controls on methane (CH4) emission from lakes are poorly understood at subdaily time scales due to a lack of continuous data, especially for ebullition. We used a novel technique to partition eddy covariance CH(4)flux observed in the littoral zone of a midlatitude shallow lake in Japan and examined the environmental controls on diffusion and ebullitive CH(4)flux separately at a subdaily time scale in different seasons. Using the high-frequency data, we investigated how CH(4)accumulation in the water and sediment layers alters the dynamics and environmental controls of fluxes. The contribution of ebullitive flux to total flux was 57% on average. Environmental controls of diffusive and ebullitive fluxes known in the literature were confirmed. We further found that the environmental controls were different in different seasons and suggested that additional consideration of CH(4)accumulation could explain the variability. The transfer of accumulated dissolved CH(4)from the bottom water layer to the surface in summer and the accumulation of dissolved CH(4)under surface ice in winter were suggested to be important for explaining the variability of diffusive flux. In summer, a higher ebullitive flux tended to occur following triggers such as a decrease in hydrostatic pressure. In winter, the impact of triggers was not obvious, and a higher ebullitive flux tended to occur in the morning. We suggested that the low CH(4)production rate in winter slowed the replenishment of bubbles in the sediment, negating the effect of triggers on ebullition.

Characterization of Seasonal Variation of the Active Layer above Permafrost with Reverse Time Migration of GPR Profiles near the Qinghai-Tibet Highway	2017 9TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON ADVANCED GROUND PENETRATING RADAR (IWAGPR)					9th International Workshop on Advanced Ground Penetrating Radar (IWAGPR)	JUN 28-30, 2017	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	IEEE, Univ Edinburgh, Sch Engn				The permafrost on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is critically sensitive to temperature changes. The balance of heat transfer between the land and the atmosphere in permafrost regions were disturbed by the construction of man-made infrastructures, such as the Qinghai-Tibet Highway (QTH), the towers of power lines and telecommunications. Obviously, the characteristics of permafrost have been altered near the QTH. Reversely, thawing and degradation of the permafrost have a serious impact to the stability of QTH. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) surveys can detect the subsurface structure of permafrost layer near the QTH that differentiate the situations in summer and winter and enable us to analyze the feature of permafrost table and active layer thickness (ALT) in different seasons. Consequently, it can provide the characterization of the relationship between the permafrost thawing and stability of QTH. Numerous studies have used the GPR to detect the permafrost and collected GPR data in summer in previous studies. However, due to the high loss of GPR signal in summer time caused by the blocking nature of the melted active layer limited the detection of formation features in greater depth. In this paper, we collected GPR data near the QTH in Beiluhe region in both summer and winter seasons and used the finite-difference reverse time migration (RTM) algorithm to process the GPR data. From the results of RTM profiles, we find that: 1) the RTM profiles in winter can provide high resolution interpretation image and clearly register the active layer/permafrost boundary and Ethological interfaces within the active layer; 2) the top boundary of the permafrost and ALT have significant change near the QTH, which may be caused by the degradation of the surface vegetation and higher temperature on sides of QTH. With the accumulation of more GPR surveys, we can potentially analyze more details and wider coverage for the characteristics of permafrost top boundary and ALT in different seasons and provide more objective input to reduce the adverse impact from engineering constructions.																					978-1-5090-5484-8				2017																								WOS:000463143800019

A paradox of warming in a deep peri-Alpine lake (Lake Lugano, Switzerland and Italy)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We investigated the effects of seasonal air temperature on the north basin of Lake Lugano (Switzerland and Italy), a deep peri-Alpine lake that is recovering from eutrophication. A priori ideas concerning the effects of temperature on key ecosystem responses were formalized in a conceptual model, which was tested against observed responses (from 28years of monitoring data) using structural equation modeling. The results broadly supported our model, and indicated that air temperature had pervasive effects on the lake's ecosystem. Warmer-than-usual winters restricted the depth of vertical mixing during turnovers and, as a result, reduced the associated replenishment of phosphorus (P) to surface waters. Moreover, although the reduction of P increased the potential for nutrient limitation, warmer winters and summers led to increases in summer chlorophyll a content (an index of phytoplankton biomass) through complex direct and indirect (food-web) effects. This apparently paradoxical effect on chlorophyll mimics a symptom of eutrophication, and suggests that climate warming might impede the recovery of the lake from eutrophication or increase the management interventions that will be required to meet the restoration targets.

Spatial ecology of non-native common carp (Cyprinus carpio) in Lake Ontario with implications for management	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Common carp, Cyprinus carpio, are a non-native species that established within the Laurentian Great Lakes more than a century ago and are abundant in some locations. Common carp have negatively impacted freshwater ecosystems, including in the Great Lakes, by increasing turbidity and uprooting vegetation through foraging and/or spawning activities. Knowledge of spatial ecology is necessary to effectively manage non-native species and aid in the development of remediation strategies. The aim of this study was to examine the spatial ecology of common carp across multiple spatial scales within Lake Ontario using passive acoustic telemetry. First, Residency Index (RI), as a metric for habitat preference, was calculated for common carp in Toronto Harbour (TH) and Hamilton Harbour (HH). Linear mixed modelling revealed that season, as well as the interaction between season and physical habitat conditions significantly affected RI. Specifically, during spring and summer common carp had significantly higher RI at sites with increased submerged aquatic vegetation, which could be associated with spawning activities. All common carp tagged in HH were resident, compared to half of individuals tagged in TH. Larger individuals tagged in TH were more likely to be absent from the array during summer. Non-resident common carp tagged at TH made extensive movements in spring and summer along the nearshore of Lake Ontario and were detected throughout the entire basin. Knowledge of spawning habitat could inform efforts to exclude common carp from these specific locations. Based on our findings, common carp should be managed at a regional level, as opposed to single sites, owing to their extensive movements.					; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010	Piczak, Morgan/0000-0002-0816-3221; Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; 													1015-1621	1420-9055				JAN	2023	85	1							20	10.1007/s00027-022-00917-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-022-00917-9								36474645					WOS:000893058600002

Small but statistically significant increases in temperatures were detected for some areas within the delta and appeared to be related to ice breakup events in nearby channels and lake systems. The magnitude of the temperature increase appeared to be correlated with the severity of winter conditions preceding breakup and with the rate at which breakup progressed. The relative importance of changes in surface albedo and river heat input in causing air temperature rises is discussed.

In combination with NCEP/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) reanalysis 850-hPa wind field and 160 stations' precipitation data in China, an intimate connection between the tropical Pacific SsT and eastern China summer precipitation anomalies is discovered by examining the time-lagged and simultaneous correlations among the interannual anomalies of SsT in the tropical Pacific, the 850-hPa wind pattern and summer rainfall in China. In previous winter, if the SsT in the tropical Pacific indicates an El Nino-type anomaly, an anticyclonic circulation anomaly over the East Asian coast, South China Sea and east of Taiwan along with a cyclonic circulation anomaly over the Japanese archipelago emerges in following summer. At the same time, a cyclonic circulation and an anticyclonic circulation prevail over the Lake Baikal and Kuril Islands in the high latitude. These combined circulation patterns facilitate the southward transport of cold air from high latitude and northward transport of warm and moist air through the western edge of the subtropical high. The meet between two air masses results in significantly abundant anomalous precipitation in the Sichuan Basin, Dongting and Poyang Lake Basin, and possibly deficit precipitation occurs over the Hetao region and lower Yellow River Basin, northern Zhejiang, as well as the coastal region of southern China and southern Yunnan. These findings offer a very useful predictive power for eastern China summer precipitation based on tropical Pacific SsT status in previous winter and subsequent developments of SsT and East Asian large-scale circulations.

Analyzing the spatiotemporal soil moisture dynamics in the area will be informative regarding agricultural drought along with flood disaster assessment and will provide early warning studies. Therefore, we evaluated the quality of European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Soil Moisture (ESA CCI_SM) data in the South-North Water Transfer JWSA. Furthermore, we utilized ensemble empirical modal decomposition, Mann-Kendall tests, and regression analysis to study the spatiotemporal variation in soil moisture for the past 29 years. The CCI _SM data displayed a high correlation with local soil measurements at nine sites. We next analyzed the CCI_SM data from three pumping stations (the Gaogang, Hongze, and Liushan stations) in the South-North Water Transfer JWSA. These stations had similar periodic characteristics of soil moisture, with significant periodic fluctuations around 3.1 d. The overall soil moisture at the three typical pumping stations demonstrated an increasing trend. We further investigated whether abrupt soil moisture changes existed at each station or not. The spatial distribution of soil moisture in the South-North Water Transfer JWSA was characterized as "dry north and wet south", with higher soil moisture in winter, followed by autumn, and low soil moisture in spring and summer. Although the linear trend of soil moisture in the South-North Water Transfer JWSA varied in significance, the overall soil moisture in the JWSA has increased over the past 29 years. The areas with significantly enhanced soil moisture are mostly distributed in the Yangzhou and Huai'an areas in the southeastern part of the study area. The areas with significantly decreased soil moisture are small in size and mostly located in northern Xuzhou.					; Cao, Jianjun/HHM-6335-2022	Cao, Jianjun/0000-0003-0182-2076; 														2072-4292				JAN	2022	14	2							256	10.3390/rs14020256	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14020256													WOS:000747826500001

The Model of Dynamics of Population Number of the Plankton Cyclop Mesocyclops leuckarti (Copepoda), Based on Photoperiodism	DORMANCY IN AQUATIC ORGANISMS. THEORY, HUMAN USE AND MODELING	Monographiae Biologicae											A model of Mesocyclops leuckarti population dynamics in a forest lake in Nord-Western Russia is described. The model is based on detailed phonological data that included the following information on copepod dormancy: density of resting stages in the lake sediments, rate of dormant stage reactivation in spring, active stage growth rate after diapause, accumulation rate of dormant stages in fall, and their survivorship during wintertime. Other important modeling parameters, such as critical photoperiodic response, percentage of diapausing stages versus day length, growth, and feeding rates for each development stage, and sensitivity to photoperiod stages, were estimated experimentally both in field and in lab. The model was verified with natural population of the species in Lake Kalishevskoe, Leningradskaya district, Nord-West of Russia. After verification, the model was used to test several hypotheses including effects of climate warming on copepod population density and accumulation of dormant stages in the end of summer. Increasing of diapausing copepodite stage density in the end of season was related to population density in the next year. The last amount was evaluated as population success obtained in competition with other zooplankton species.					; alekseev, victor/C-7086-2014	Alekseev, Victor/0000-0002-1968-2609; 													0077-0639		978-3-030-21213-1; 978-3-030-21212-4				2019	92						247	258		10.1007/978-3-030-21213-1_15	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-21213-1_15	10.1007/978-3-030-21213-1												WOS:000553031200016

The fish community was also sampled to examine prey availability. Gizzard Shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) and Yellow Bass (Morone mississippiensis) were the most important species in cormorant diet. Other, less important, cormorant prey species included Channel Catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), cyprinids (minnows), and sunfishes (Lepomis spp.). Diet varied by season and sex. Cormorants consumed higher proportions of cyprinids and Channel Catfish in the autumn than the remainder of the over-wintering period. In general, females consumed Gizzard Shad more than males, while males consumed Channel Catfish more than females. Neither genders consumed notable amounts of sport fish. Prey size did not differ between the sexes, but did vary by season. These data demonstrate the relative importance of forage and rough fish and the lesser relative importance of sport fish in the diet of cormorants over-wintering on an oxbow lake ill Southeast Arkansas.																			1524-4695	1938-5390				JUN	2004	27	2					170	176		10.1675/1524-4695(2004)027[0170:SDOMAF]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/1524-4695(2004)027[0170:SDOMAF]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000222000900007
J	Chhin, S; O'Brien, J				Chhin, Sophan; O'Brien, Joseph			Dendroclimatic analysis of red pine affected by Diplodia shoot blight in different latitudinal regions in Michigan	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												Drought and intraspecific competition in red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) stands in Michigan have been implicated as predisposing factors for increased shoot blight risk caused by Diplodia pinea Desm. The overall objective of this study is to examine the interactive effects of drought, other climatic factors, and biotic factors (intraspecific competition) on productivity and growth of red pine forests affected by Diplodia shoot blight. This study incorporates a dendroclimatic approach that allows the retrospective examination of past annual diameter growth in relation to historical climate and the assessment of the potential impacts of future climate change. A total of 20 red pine stands were sampled in two latitudinal regions (the Upper Peninsula (UP) and the Lower Peninsula (LP) regions) of Michigan across two levels of initial stand density (low vs. high) and two levels of forest health condition (healthy vs. D. pinea affected). The full dendroclimatic relationships revealed in this study indicated that other climatic factors, in addition to summer drought stress, impacted red pine radial growth. Overall, red pine radial growth was generally more affected by precipitation and moisture index than solely by temperature variables. The radial growth response to climate depended on latitudinal region: summer moisture stress was more influential in the LP; cold spring and early summer temperatures negatively impacted growth more in the UP; and the degree of winter harshness was more of a factor in the UP. Crown damage caused by winter damage may have predisposed red pine stands to D. pinea affection by providing an easier entry point for fungal infection. Negative relations with precipitation in D. pinea affected stands may be due to increased dispersal of spores in D. pinea affected stands with significant rain and any increased storm and wind activity. Projections of radial growth under future scenarios of climate change indicate that climate warming has the potential to increase growth mainly in red pine stands in the UP region where growth has historically been limited by cool temperatures early in the growing season. Under the moisture index model, growth of red pine under the drier (A2) climate change scenario, only the D. pinea impacted high-density stands in the LP region are projected to show a significant decrease in growth by the middle (2041-2070) and final (2071-2100) projection periods. Model-based projections of forest growth in Michigan generally do not account for forest health issues such as invasive pathogens. The current study therefore provides a new understanding of the role of forest pathogens under future climate change.																			0045-5067	1208-6037				DEC	2015	45	12					1757	1767		10.1139/cjfr-2015-0245	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2015-0245													WOS:000365335600010

From October 2013 to April 2014, the age structure of the Tundra Swan was surveyed by point count method at 45 survey sites of Poyang Lake. In middle wintering stage (from December to February), the sex ratio of common teal Anas crecca (60.66% male, n=361) was male-biased while falcated duck Anas falcata (52.10%, n=286), mallard Anas platyrhynchos (50.00%, n=90) and Eurasian wigeon Anas penelope (49.18%, n=183) were near parity. The male ratio of common teal, falcated duck and Eurasian wigeon all showed a tendency of initially increasing and later decreasing throughout the wintering period while mallard showed a continuous growth trend. The male-biased sex ratios in the common teal may be owing to increased female mortality on both breeding and wintering grounds. The intra-seasonal differences in sex ratios for all the ducks can be partly attributed to earlier arrival of males to wintering areas closer to breeding areas, while females and juveniles head further south. There were greater numbers of females for all the ducks in the early wintering stage (from October to November) and the male ratio increased again in the middle wintering stage, which shows that females arrive at winter areas before males in Poyang Lake. Tundra Swan Cygnus columbianus had relative high juvenile percentage (28.27%, n=3130). In the early wintering and spring migration stages (from March to April), the proportions of juveniles were significantly higher than in the middle wintering stage. This may indicate that family groups with young ones arrived at Poyang Lake to winter before those who did not participate or failed to breed, but returned later to breeding grounds, knowledge about this can provide guidance to management task.					chen, hongyu/HHS-4314-2022														0030-9923					JUN	2016	48	3					839	844																WOS:000378177500029
J	KING, RD; TYLER, PA				KING, RD; TYLER, PA			DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS OF THE GORDON RIVER POWER DEVELOPMENT, SOUTHWEST TASMANIA	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												A survey of the physicochemical limnology of the Gordon River, designed to provide background environmental data for the proposed stage 2 of the Gordon River Power Development, revealed far-reaching consequences of the dams of stage 1, for which only rudimentary surveys were carried out. An obvious hydrological effect was the damping of seasonal flow variations, so that the regulated river experienced higher summer flows and lower winter flows than under natural conditions. River levels were consequently affected and summer growth of photosynthetic algae in former shallows and riffle zones no longer occurred. Other biological effects were unknown. The effective headwaters of the river were the hypolimnetic strata of a large stratified reservoir, Lake Gordon. The river was fed with a relatively constant discharge of water of almost invariable temperature and chemical composition. The effects of influent tributaries downstream were overridden by this constant flow. Temperatures varied little along the length of the regulated river, being above normal in winter and below normal in summer. Chemical variability was reduced in respect to the lower salinity range and in the suppression of flow-dependent alternation between dominance by NaCl or by alkaline earth bicarbonate. An unfortunate hydrological effect was the elimination of an estuarine underflow of salt water on which the meromixis of 3 lakes depended. While 2 showed little change in the short time since dam construction, one became holomictic soon after discharge from the dam commenced. A temporary return to meromixis after a brief shutdown of the power station indicated that an appropriate operating regime, with brief summer shutdowns, could retain the affected lake in a meromictic condition of scientific interest.																			0067-1940						1982	33	3					431	442																WOS:A1982NW51600004

Recent studies have shown that chrysophyte stomatocysts, or simply cysts (sub-fossil algal remains of Chrysophyceae and Synurophyceae), are among the very few natural proxies that can be used to reconstruct cold-season temperatures. This study presents a quantitative, high-resolution (5-year), cold-season (Oct-May) temperature reconstruction based on sub-fossil chrysophyte stomatocysts in the annually laminated (varved) sediments of high-Alpine Lake Silvaplana, SE Switzerland (1,789 m a.s.l.), since AD 1500. We first explore the method used to translate an ecologically meaningful variable based on a biological proxy into a simple climate variable. A transfer function was applied to reconstruct the 'date of spring mixing' from cyst assemblages. Next, statistical regression models were tested to convert the reconstructed 'dates of spring mixing' into cold-season surface air temperatures with associated errors. The strengths and weaknesses of this approach are thoroughly tested. One much-debated, basic assumption for reconstructions ('stationarity'), which states that only the environmental variable of interest has influenced cyst assemblages and the influence of confounding variables is negligible over time, is addressed in detail. Our inferences show that past cold-season air-temperature fluctuations were substantial and larger than those of other temperature reconstructions for Europe and the Alpine region. Interestingly, in this study, recent cold-season temperatures only just exceed those of previous, multi-decadal warm phases since AD 1500. These findings highlight the importance of local studies to assess natural climate variability at high altitudes.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				DEC	2013	50	4					519	533		10.1007/s10933-013-9743-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-013-9743-5													WOS:000326622200008

Carrion from large carnivores and food from humans subsidize mesocarnivores year round	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The return of large carnivores is predicted to suppress meso-carnivores, though it has only been observed in a minority of contemporary studies. Isle Royale is a remote island wilderness in Lake Superior, USA, managed for outdoor recreation. Following their natural extirpation, the National Parks Service translocated gray wolves (Canis lupus) in 2018-2019 and we expected the return of suppression and trophic facilitation of meso-carnivores. Nevertheless, we hypothesized that human resource subsidies led to a breakdown in meso-predator release. From Fall 2021-Winter 2024, we captured 16 individual red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), collected whiskers, and subsampled them to recreate the yearly diet of the population using stable isotope analysis. Notably, meso-carnivores were not demographically suppressed. Coinciding with the dates when Isle Royale National Park opened, fox diets were generalized, dissimilar between individuals, and primarily composed of human foods (0.28 +/- 0.02) during summer. In winter, fox diets were specialized and exhibited high similarity, being composed primarily of carrion subsidized by wolves (0.62 +/- 0.04). We propose that the complementarity of human resource subsidies to communities and ecosystems, broadly, may help explain the limited reach of the anticipated interactions following the return of large carnivores, such as meso-predator release.

Subadult burbot were sampled in three temperate reservoirs in spring, and one of them also in summer and autumn. Standardised abundance and sizes of burbot were comparable between the reservoirs, but the conditions were significantly different. The Clark's condition coefficient and index of fullness were independent of burbot size and individuals. Feeding behaviour in terms of abundance and composition of consumed food was environment-dependent. The most common prey category was aquatic insect larvae, dominating in the riverine environment. Permanent water invertebrates, microcrustaceans, beetles and crayfish were less common food and eaten more often in the lacustrine environment. Prey-fish were usually the most common species of suitable size. The food analyses demonstrated opportunistic feeding behaviour with selection of prey associated with benthic habitat and suitable size. Burbot is therefore flexible not only in environments utilisation, but also feeding strategy.

The monitoring of supraglacial lakes is important as they play a key role in modulating the hydrological system and the Greenland Ice Sheet's mass balance. Recent studies show that numerous supraglacial lakes in the Greenland Ice Sheet do not refreeze completely in winter, but existing in the form of liquid water under snow or ice, which are referred as buried lakes. These buried lakes has the potential to impact the stability and mass balance of Greenland Ice Sheet. However, it is difficult to extract and analyse these buried lakes by using the visible images, because they exist under the surface of the Greenland Ice Sheet. In this study, we proposed a method to automatically extract the buried lakes by using both the Landsat8 and Sentinel-1 images. This method uses visible images to extract supraglacial lakes in summer to mask the SAR images, and then adopts the Rosin Threshold Segmentation Algorithm to extract buried lakes in the Central West basin of Greenland in the winter of 2018-2019. In addition, we analysed the distribution of these buried lakes by separating the water and ice based on the backscatter coefficient. We extracted the buried lakes in selected 10 test areas with our method and compared the results with those derived from visual interpretation. The results show that our method achieves good performance with the Kappa coefficient being up to 0. 85. Moreover, the area of supraglacial lakes is 102. 28 km(2) in the Central West basin of Greenland in summer of 2018. About 43. 09% of supraglacial lakes occurred in summer do not refreeze completely and becomes the buried lakes (44. 07 km(2)) in winter.

Food web effects and the disappearance of the spring clear water phase in Onondaga Lake following nutrient loading reductions	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Wang RW, Rudstam LG, Brooking TE, Snyder DJ, Arrigo MA, Mills EL. 2010. Food web effects and the disappearance of the spring clear water phase in Onondaga Lake following nutrient loading reductions. Lake Reserv Manage. 26: 169-177. The annual spring clear water phase (May-June) in Onondaga Lake, New York, unexpectedly disappeared in 2003 following several years of phosphorus and ammonia loading reductions at the Metropolitan Syracuse Wastewater Treatment Facility (Metro). Mean chlorophyll a concentration during May-June was higher from 2003 to 2007 than from 1990 to 2002, with mean Secchi disk depths < 2 m. Large zooplankton (Daphnia sp.) were abundant during April-June before 2003 but were rare from 2003 to 2007, while abundance of small zooplankton (Bosmina longirostris) increased. Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) catches from electrofishing surveys dramatically increased in 2003, and hydroacoustic surveys estimated the alewife population to be between 1600 and 2300 fish/ha in spring 2005-2007. The alewife population in 2005 was dominated by a strong 2002 year class. Increasing biomass of the 2002 year class coincided with the timing of the shift from large to small zooplankton in late summer of 2002. This indicates that the strong 2002 alewife year class initiated a classic trophic cascade in Onondaga Lake, causing the decline and continuing low abundance of Daphnia sp. and the disappearance of the spring clear water phase. The increase in alewife may have been associated with decreasing ammonia concentrations following improvement to Metro. Unionized ammonia has been below levels considered toxic to nonsalmonid fish species since 1999, and the ammonia concentration continues to decrease in the lake. Thus, reductions in nutrient loading can lead to unanticipated food web effects causing decreases rather the expected increases in water clarity in the spring-early summer period.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2010	26	3					169	177		10.1080/07438141.2010.504070	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438141.2010.504070													WOS:000288116800001

Total N was added to the lake in quantities of 445 to 778 lb/day (200 to 350 kg) and total P was added at a rate of 15 to 30 lb/day (6.8 to 13.6 kg). Total N values reached 3.3 mg/1 in the surface waters and 6.2 mg/1 in the profundal waters in Feb. Inorganic N concentrations exceeded 0.3 mg/1 at all depths except in the autumn. Surface water total P concentrations were 0.05 mg/1 during late winter and spring. The concentration increased to 0.07 mg/1 in Aug. and decreased to 0.04 mgA in Oct.-Nov. Annually, the lake retained 48% of the 8000 lb (3630 kg) of P it received but none of the N. Phytoplankton volumes were dense, reaching as much as 2260 lb/surface acre (2540 kg/ha) (wet weight) during the maximum growing period. The chlorophyll a concentration reached as much as 161 mg/sq m. It was concluded that an 80% minimum reduction in the P contributed to the lake by industrial and municipal wastes is necessary to reduce the severe algal nuisances, support increased recreational use, and enhance shoreline real estate values.																			0043-1303						1968	40	2P2S					R72	+																WOS:A1968A741100007

Evaluative calculations of relative depth showed that 19 lakes may be meromictic. The hydrological studies on seven lakes have confirmed the presence of meromixis for six of them. The stability of meromictic lakes and the possibility of chemocline destruction in autumn and mixing of water to the bottom in some lakes are assessed. In dimictic lakes, the destruction of thermocline by winds is unlikely in summer. In autumn, the convective component prevails in the water mixing due to a higher mineralization of the surface layer.

Fish die-offs are concurrent with thermal extremes in north temperate lakes	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE												As environmental temperatures continue to rise and organisms experience novel and potentially lethal conditions(1-5), the possibility of increased mass mortality events for animal populations appears likely(1,6). Yet, due to die-off rarity and unpredictability, there have been few large-scale attempts to quantify the relationship between mass die-offs and local environmental temperatures. Here, we address this issue by analysing a database of 502 freshwater fish die-offs combined with lake-specific temperature profiles simulated for north temperate lake ecosystems. Die-offs driven by extreme summer conditions occurred disproportionately in lakes with warmer average surface temperatures and during periods of extreme heat. In contrast, we observed no relationships between current thermal extremes and die-offs attributed to infectious disease or winter environmental conditions. We forecast fish die-offs driven by summer environmental conditions to double by mid-century for north temperate lakes (2041-2059) and to increase more than fourfold by late century (2081-2099), particularly at southern latitudes. These results expose a direct link between novel temperature regimes and the increased probability of catastrophic ecological events in freshwater ecosystems.

J	MacKenzie, RA; Kaster, JL				MacKenzie, RA; Kaster, JL			Temporal and spatial patterns of insect emergence from a Lake Michigan coastal wetland	WETLANDS												Emergence traps were used to sample insects along a transect through a river delta wetland on Green Bay, Lake Michigan in an attempt to document spatial and temporal patterns in insect emergence. Various abiotic factors were also measured to determine which factors influenced these dynamics. Significant decreasing gradients in dissolved oxygen and pH with distance from the river, coupled with trends in sum nitrate (nitrate + nitrite), revealed that riverine water was mixing with wetland water up to 100 m from the wetland-river interface. Annual emerging insect densities decreased exponentially with distance from the river while emerging insect biomass decreased linearly with distance, both of which were significant. Insects were largely comprised of Chironomidae, which represented 7-88% of the insects emerging. Loss of biomass was largely due to emergence of Aeshnidae (0-34%), Libellulidae (0-69%), Coenagrionidae (0-23%), Siphlonuridae (0-63%), and Chironomidae (1-25%). Major Chironomidae emergence events occurred from early spring until early summer and again from late summer to early fall. These events were likely an important source of energy needed for avian egg production, duckling growth, or migratory flights. Spatial and temporal patterns revealed the importance of wetland areas adjacent to the Peshtigo River to emerging insects, as well as to the transient organisms that use them as a. food source.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				SEP	2004	24	3					688	700		10.1672/0277-5212(2004)024[0688:TASPOI]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/0277-5212(2004)024[0688:TASPOI]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000224309600017

Spatiotemporal variability in water sources of urban soils and trees in the semiarid, irrigated Salt Lake Valley	ECOHYDROLOGY												Plant transpiration is a critical process in ecohydrology and urban water budgets. Urban forests in the semiarid cities of the western United States are composed largely of non-native species sustained by irrigation. Given that the major end use of water in these cities is usually landscape irrigation, the efficiency of irrigation practices is essential in future water conservation measures. The dependence of urban trees on irrigation is driven not only by the availability of alternative water sources (e.g., precipitation) but also by patterns of infiltration and mobility of soil water. We used hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes to identify spatiotemporal dynamics of trees, of varied sizes and species, and shallow soil water apportioning of irrigation versus winter snowmelt in urban parks in the semiarid Salt Lake Valley. We estimate for this ecosystem that, on average, >70% of tree transpiration and soil moisture during the summer originate from irrigation, with lower proportions of snowmelt (<30%) from the preceding winter. This implies that a fraction of summer transpiration is originated from out of phase precipitation inputs. Irrigation fractions are dominant throughout the growing season for soil and stem water, but snowmelt fractions increase in stem water towards the end of summer. Tree size, location, and species were not strongly associated with water sources under well-irrigated conditions. These results show that urban tree management practices should consider the impact of both irrigation practices and residual precipitation inputs, highlighting the importance of examining interannual time scales when calculating the local water budget.

These assumptions have rarely been properly tested, and there is no study in which a species' major food types have been measured by standardized methods throughout a flyway and over a large part of the year. We here present such data for Eurasian teal (Anas crecca), converted to a common energetic currency, and collected at wintering, spring staging and breeding sites. Teal did not time migration to maximize local food abundance; most birds left wintering and spring staging sites before a sharp increase in invertebrate food abundance occurred. On the other hand, hatching of ducklings coincided with a peak in invertebrate food abundance on boreal breeding lakes. Mean overall food abundance (invertebrates and seeds combined) did not differ between wintering sites in southern France and breeding sites in northern Sweden at the time of breeding. Our results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that long-distance migration in dabbling ducks has evolved because adult birds gain an immediate pay-off in increased food abundance by flying north in spring. However, our data confirm a selective advantage for breeding at higher latitudes, because hatching of ducklings may coincide with a peak in invertebrate emergence and because longer days may increase the duration of efficient foraging.

Acceptable growing conditions prevail along the fjords in western Norway and around the lakes in eastern Norway at 60 degrees north. These specific mesic climate conditions are associated with very long summer days (18 h daylight mid-summer) and short winter days (6 h daylight), with frost rarely occurring in the spring along the fjord areas. The present apple-growing technique in Norway is similar to that of other developed apple-growing countries, taking into account that all local growing phases involve a considerable delay in progress (1.5-2 months). Therefore, high-density planting systems based on the use of dwarf rootstocks (mainly M.9) with imported early maturing international apple cultivars are used in most orchards. The most common soil type has high organic matter content (2-18%), which persists due to the cool climate and low mineralization, and a clay content of <15%, which results from the formation of the soil from bedrock. The increase in average temperatures caused by current climatic changes leads to a complex combination of different physiological effects on apples, which can have positive or negative effects on the phenology of the trees. The main advantage of Norwegian apple production is that the quality and aroma of the fruit meet the current demands of the local market.

Variations in chromophoric dissolved organic matter and its influence on the use of pigment-specific fluorimeters in the Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The variability of colored material (yellow substances, chromophoric dissolved organic matter [CDOM]) in Great Lakes water on the operation of a submersible pigment-based fluorimeter (FluoroProbe) was assessed. The FluoroProbe is designed to account for the influence of ambient CDOM on fluorimetric analysis of natural waters by using background yellow substance content to correct for fluorescence that is not due to phytoplankton. The objective of this study was to assess FluoroProbe performance as well as determine the variability of CDOM that has a bearing on instrument use. This study focused on Lakes Ontario and Huron in spring and summer and employed up to three FluoroProbes for simultaneous comparisons of performance, as assessed by comparing in situ versus extracted concentrations of chlorophyll-a. Conclusions from this study are: FluoroProbes are not equally accurate; yellow substance correction factors obtained by FluoroProbes are instrument specific; there are seasonal differences in yellow substance correction factors between summer and spring and among thermal strata in summer, in Lakes Huron and Ontario.The observed differences among yellow substance correction factors are attributed to chromophoric material that was assessed independently by measuring CDOM using a separate fluorimetric technique and by measuring in situ UV absorption coefficients. These results suggest that the use of FluoroProbes and related instruments for phytoplankton surveillance and monitoring initiatives must account for differences in ambient CDOM.

We use 2279 recoveries and 16 769 resightings of 4735 colour-ringed individuals to describe dispersal and timing of movements of Danish Cormorants. Most Cormorants dispersed from the colonies to coastal areas and freshwater lakes in Denmark, Sweden and northern Germany in July. Southward movements took place throughout July to December. Major departure from the post-breeding areas occurred from August to mid-October, with many birds staging at Dutch and Alpine lakes between September and October, and with arrival in the Mediterranean mainly from October to November. Spring migration was fast, occurring from mid-February to March. First-year birds migrated south faster and reached the wintering areas sooner than adults, but left these later and moved north more slowly than adults. Wintering occurred from Portugal in the west to Greece in the east, and from Denmark in the north to North Africa in the south. The majority of Cormorants spent the winter in Mediterranean France, Italy Yugoslavia, Albania, Algeria and in particular in Tunisia. Adult males stayed closer to the breeding areas in winter than females, and adults tended to winter further north than first-year birds. Sex differences in body size and advantages of arriving early at the breeding sites may explain why males wintered further north than females.					; Frederiksen, Morten/A-7542-2008; Bregnballe, Thomas/L-1890-2013	Bregnballe, Thomas/0000-0003-2867-478X; Frederiksen, Morten/0000-0001-5550-0537; 													0006-3657					NOV	1997	44		3				257	276		10.1080/00063659709461062	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00063659709461062													WOS:A1997YG30800001

During this period the atmospheric input and sedimentary flux of Be-7, as well as concentrations of dissolved (<10 kD), colloidal (10 kD-1 mu m), and particulate (>1 mu m) Be-7 in the epilimnion were measured. The separation of dissolved, colloidal, and particulate fractions of Be-7 was carried out using continuous how centrifugation (CFC) and tangential flow filtration (TFF) techniques. Lacustrine colloids (log K(c) approximate to 6) were shown to be much more efficient sorbents for Be-7 than the suspended particles (log K(p) 4-5). Particle concentrations C(p) ranged from 0.5 to 2 mg/L. The ratio of colloid (>10 kD) to particle concentration C(c)/C(p) was close to 0.09 during winter months when detrital inputs are dominant, but was higher (0.16) in summer and in spring after an algal bloom. The Be-7 data were used to estimate coagulation rates of colloids. The highest coagulation rates (lambda(coag) approximate to 0.4 d(-1)) along with the lowest K(c) (log K(c) approximate to 5.2) were found after an algal bloom in spring.

We assessed fish distribution and diel movement in May and July through the use of gill nets set at various depths in 1.5-7.0 m depth contour zones, supplemented by observations of fish reaction to the nets. Golden shiners and alewives occupied thc upper part of the water column, with the former concentrated at the littoral zone-open water interface. and the latter in the open water. Yellow perch occupied the lower part of the water column in all depth contours. Bluegills were abundant in the upper to midwater depths in all contour zones, black crappies were concentrated in the 2.5-3.5 m zones. All of these species showed either a diel or a spring-summer change in distribution pattern. Bluegills were more abundant in offshore locations in July, whereas golden shiners and yellow perch were more abundant onshore in May. Alewives and black crappies showed distinct diel movements in July, as they were largely absent from the study area during the day, but returned at night to feed. In general, there was more spatial separation among the five species in July than in May. Patterns of spatial distribution among the species generally corresponded with the type and variety of prey consumed, and with diel movement of prey in the case of water column feeders. Other factors that apparently affected spatial distribution and seasonal shifts in this assemblage were risk of predation (golden shiner), spawning activity (alewife), and a decline in prey abundance from spring to summer (bluegill and yellow perch).																			0378-1909					JUN	1992	34	2					159	170		10.1007/BF00002391	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00002391													WOS:A1992JB64300006

All reservoirs were strong sources of CH4 in all seasons. Surface water CH4 varied between 1350 and 524 000% saturation, and was overall highest in spring and summer, and lowest in winter, however, with no clear patterns common to all reservoirs. In contrast, all reservoirs switched from weak N2O sinks in spring to strong N2O sources for the rest of the year. N2O saturation in all reservoirs varied between 70 and 12-30%. There were significant differences for CH4 concentrations and fluxes between the reservoirs. Within each reservoir, there was strong spatial CH4 variability but minimal N2O saturation variability. CH4 saturation was higher in inflow zones than in the main body. Area-weighted average fluxes were estimated using six waterair gas transfer velocity estimation models and resulted in fluxes in the range 4.820.5, 2.35.4, and 2.37.5 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1), while N2O was 0.070.41, 0.090.22, and 0.030.09 mg N2O m(-2) d(-1) for LND, LW, and LB, respectively. Total emissions, in carbon dioxide equivalents, from all measurement campaigns were CH4 dominated (67-86%). The measured degree of CH4 saturation and fluxes are among the highest reported thus far indicating that subtropical freshwater reservoirs could be significant aquatic greenhouse gas sources. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the interplay between biogeochemical processes and the physical forcing driving the waterair gaseous emissions. The high variability coupled with the lack of consensus among estimation models calls for concerted efforts to address uncertainty of measurements for reliable emissions accounting.					; Yuan, Zhiguo/C-4980-2013; yuan, zhiguo/C-4980-2013	Grinham, Alistair/0000-0001-8313-2276; yuan, zhiguo/0000-0002-7566-1482													0013-936X	1520-5851				DEC 16	2014	48	24					14499	14507		10.1021/es505324h	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es505324h								25409278					WOS:000346686100053

Five seepage lakes in northcentral Wisconsin, ranging in pH from 4.7 to 7.2, have been studied under a variety of limnological conditions which included the following seasonal periods: summer (peak stratification), fall (following turnover) and late winter (under ice). Analytically, DGM was determined after purging lake water with argon and collecting the volatile Hg fraction on gold coated sand. The Hg collections were analysed by pyrolysis in a two-stage Au amalgamation gas train with detection by atomic fluorescence spectroscopy (AFS). In addition, chemical speciation of the volatile fraction has been achieved by trapping on a nondestructive substrate followed by gas chromatographic separation and AFS detection. The DGM consists principally of elemental Hg (Hg(o)) under all sampling conditions, with no significant contribution from volatile organic Hg species (detection limit of 3 femtomolar). Atmospheric gaseous Hg, which also consists principally of Hg(o), was measured and the air-water partitioning determined. In general, the lake waters have been supersaturated with Hg(o) relative to the atmosphere. Supersaturation was greater in the summer, ranging from ca. 1.4 to 12 times (x) the saturation concentration. During the other sampling periods, Hg(o) ranged from saturation to ca. 7x the equilibrium concentration. The flux of Hg from the lakes due to gas evasion is significant and is estimated at approximately 10% of the annual atmospheric input of Hg to the lakes. An apparent relationship between Hg(o) and pH has been observed with lakes of lower pH having smaller Hg(o) concentrations.

Here, we present a multiproxy sedimentological, geochemical and palynological record from the Hashilan Wetland in the central Zagros Mountains, spanning the time interval from 22 to 2.2 kcal bp. Our results indicate a cold, dry climate for the last deglaciation (22 to 10 kcal bp) with amplified aridity during the Last Glacial Maximum, Heinrich Stadial 1, the Younger Dryas and the 8.2 and 3.2 ka events. The Early Holocene (11.6 to 7.8 kcal bp) is characterised by prolonged dry summers, frequent spring/summer dust storms and restricted oak woodlands that gradually expanded as summers shortened toward the second half of the Holocene (bp). We show an out-of-phase Holocene moisture variation between the interior of West Asia and the Indian Summer Monsoon domain and conclude that summer insolation-driven latitudinal shifts of the Hadley cell played a key role in seasonality changes in the interior of West Asia by modulating the strength and pathway of the subtropical high-pressure cells. Finally, we explore possible impacts of these changes on regional prehistoric human communities.

The relationship between the mean size of prewinter age-0 largemouth bass and relative survival through the first winter was assessed in seven northern Illinois impoundments. In each of these impoundments from 1988 to 1991, age-0 largemouth bass were sampled using AC electrofishing techniques during early fall (late, September/early October), and then again in the following April. For each collection of age-0 largemouth bass we determined the catch-per-unit effort (CPUE), total length, and condition. Within a given year there was substantial variation among lakes in the mean size of age-0 largemouth bass, but limited variation among years for a given lake. The postwinter/prewinter relative abundance of largemouth bass was determined annually for each reservoir. The hypothesis that postwinter abundance of age-0 largemouth bass is strongly related to prewinter size was not supported by our data. Instead, in northern Illinois impoundments, it appears that postwinter abundance of largemouth bass is dictated by the abundance of age-0 fish at the end of the first growing season, regardless of size.																			0892-2284		1-888569-38-7				2002	31						91	99																WOS:000180817600007
J	Carlson, DL; Basu, I; Hites, RA				Carlson, DL; Basu, I; Hites, RA			Annual variations of pesticide concentrations in great lakes precipitation	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Twenty pesticides and related analytes were measured in 28-day integrated precipitation samples from five U.S. sites in the Integrated Atmospheric Deposition Network (IADN) between 1997 and 2002. Consistent, significant decreases in concentration as a function of time were observed only for p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDD, while increases in beta-HCH were observed at all sites. Significant annual variations were observed for most analytes at each site with higher concentrations in the summer for current-use pesticides (endosulfan and gamma-HCH) and peaks in the winter for most others. The increased concentrations in the winter are likely the result of the increased scavenging efficiency of snow compared to rain and, for some analytes, higher concentrations in the particulate phase during winter. These seasonal differences appear to account for a large portion of the observed variability in pesticide concentrations in precipitation samples.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				OCT 15	2004	38	20					5290	5296		10.1021/es049751h	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es049751h								15543728					WOS:000224519500011
J	Bayley, PB; Austen, DJ				Bayley, PB; Austen, DJ			Capture efficiency of a boat electrofisher	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Models for fish capture efficiency (catchability) using a boat-mounted AC electro-fishing sampling protocol were estimated for warmwater fishes in Illinois lakes through a calibration process. Catchabilities were determined for 37 inshore zones in blocked enclosures or ponds and 5 large water bodies during fall or spring. The abundances of vulnerable fish populations were determined by census following draining or by treatment using rotenone or primacord of known catchability. Inshore catchabilities, based on a zone 0-13 m from shore, were strongly dependent on fish length (as a unimodal function), fish taxa, mean depth, and surface macrophyte cover. Under average environmental conditions, maximum catchabilities by taxon ranged from 0.0018 to 0.14 and ranked (highest to lowest) as follows: largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, common carp Cyprinus carpio, crappies Pomoxis spp. in spring, shad Dorosoma spp., bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, green sunfish L. cyanellus, crappies in fall, freshwater drum Aplodinotus grunniens, suckers (Catostomidae), and catfish (Ictaluridae). Catchabilities for common carp and shad were significantly lower in large water bodies, indicating that significant numbers were outside the inshore zone. However, the results for other species, including large samples of largemouth bass and bluegills, indicated that populations in similar whole lakes could be estimated from the predicted inshore electrofishing catchabilities in fall or spring. Strong biases in relative population density when inferred by catch per unit effort were demonstrated under differing environmental conditions. Also, estimates of ratios related to fish size, such as mortality rates, were seriously biased when based on the size structure of uncorrected catches. Therefore, catchability models are considered essential for assessing the absolute and relative attributes of fish populations across water bodies.																			0002-8487					MAY	2002	131	3					435	451		10.1577/1548-8659(2002)131<0435:CEOABE>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2002)131<0435:CEOABE>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000175453300007

Data from simultaneous high frequency monitoring of the lake-water temperature profile can be used as additional information for calculating these fluxes more accurately, if the large random fluctuations of such data could be overcome. This challenge can be achieved using an algorithm that filters out the natural noise of both the surface fluxes calculation ("model") and the monitoring data ("measurement"), such as the Kalman Filter (KF). The KF uses statistics of the uncertainty in the dynamics of the heat balance model and the measurements, and improves the calculated heat storage estimate. The KF algorithm was applied for studying the energy balance at the surface of Lake Kinneret, Israel. We tested its operation using different algorithms, in light of seasonal variations associated with meteorological and lake temperature conditions. Typically, during the spring and summer the uncertainty of the heat storage data result in low Kalman Gain, K, whereas during calm lake conditions, in the autumn, the gain was high. Using only data already measured in "the past" and the current measurement, the KF is more suitable for cases where information regarding surface fluxes is required online than other filters (such as a moving average), which need data from "the future."					; Broday, David/CAG-3728-2022; Gutman, Per-Olof/D-6907-2016	Broday, David/0000-0002-6525-3979; 													1541-5856					MAY	2017	15	5					467	479		10.1002/lom3.10173	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lom3.10173													WOS:000404012700004
J	Kubera, L; Kalwasinska, A; Perlinski, P				Kubera, Lukasz; Kalwasinska, Agnieszka; Perlinski, Piotr			Assessment of the Structure and Activity of Bacterial Communities as a Tandem Tool for Estimating the Ecological Condition of Lakes in Poland	ECOSYSTEMS												The assessment of the qualitative and quantitative structure of microbial communities is vital for recognizing the role that microorganisms play in aquatic ecosystems. We investigated microbial communities using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, and the population activity, using fluorescent markers. Three lakes (oligotrophic, eutrophic, and hypertrophic) were studied in spring, summer, and autumn 2021 in the Zaborski Landscape Park, northern Poland. The results showed that dead bacterial cells dominated in the tested water samples. Their distribution was mainly related to the trophic status of the studied lakes. Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Actinobacteria predominated in bacterioplankton. At lower taxonomic levels, certain groups were associated specifically with the eutrophic Lake Nied & zacute;wiedzie, mainly bacteria of the Flavobacterium and Rheinheimera genera, which in spring accounted for 14.4% and 11.95% of the population, respectively. Our analyses demonstrated that the structure of bacterial communities (beta-diversity) was strongly correlated with the trophic status of the studied lakes. This study indicates that the environmental gradient has a strong influence on the functional and taxonomic structure of bacterioplankton. Our study demonstrates that the assessment of the activity and spatial structure of bacterial communities can be a useful tool for determining differences in the ecological state of waterbodies. Moreover, knowledge about the factors shaping the structure of microbial communities can be helpful in responding to any disturbances in the functioning of lake ecosystems.

Population data were collected on 7,782 white crappie from 557 trap-net samples in the fall (N = 4,679 fish/243 nets) and spring (N = 3,103 fish/314 nets), 1987-1989. Generally, catch/day (N fish/24 hours) estimates were higher and less variable in trap nets set at water depths of 1.0-2.9 m and on bottom slopes of 0.0%-7.9%. Catch/day estimates were higher, but equally variable, in trap nets set perpendicular to the shoreline and at water temperatures of 16.0-19.9 C in the fall and 20.0-23.9 C in the spring. These findings indicate trap-netting efficacy could be augmented by sampling under the specified ranges of sampling conditions.

Although methylmercury (MMHg) photodegradation (PD) is an important process involved in mercury cycling in this zone, little is known about this process. In situ incubation experiments were therefore performed to quantify the effect of different wavelength radiations and environmental factors on the PD process of MMHg in the water bodies of TGR. It was found that the effect of solar radiation on MMHg PD was highly dependent on wavelength and water depth. All PD-rate constants resulting from each wavelength range decreased rapidly with water depth. For surface water, UV-A radiation (320-400 nm) was the key driver, accounting for 49%-62% of MMHg PD. For the entire water column, both photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm) and UV-A were responsible for MMHg PD. MMHg PD fluxes peaked in summer (7.5-18 ng m(-2) d(-1)), followed by spring (3.3-8.0 ng m(-2) d(-1)), autumn (1.0-2.7 ng m(-2) d(-1)), and winter (0.060-0.15 ng m(-2) d(-1)). The annual fluxes of MMHg PD were estimated to be 1.1-2.8 mu g m(-2) a(-1). Filtering the reservoir water and amending it with chemicals (i.e., Cl-, NO (3) (-) , and dissolved organic matter (DOM)) showed significant effects on MMHg PD rate constants. Stepwise regression analysis showed that intensity of solar radiation, suspended particulate matter (SPM), DOM, Cl-, and NO (3) (-) were involved in the PD process. Path analysis clarified the relationship between MMHg PD rate constants and environmental variables, as well as the comparative strength of direct and indirect relationships among variables. The results are of great importance for understanding MMHg cycling characteristics in TGR and also facilitate the understanding of the underlying process, MMHg PD, in natural waters.					sun, rong/JRX-7214-2023	sun, Rongguo/0000-0002-8788-5539													1674-7291	1869-1870				JUN	2015	58	6					1073	1081		10.1007/s11426-015-5380-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11426-015-5380-3													WOS:000355266100025

Later, during summer and autumn, crustacean zooplankton (cladocerans and copepods) were the most important food items; selected species were Polyphemus pediculus, Eudiaptomus gracilis, Limnocalanus macrurus, Heterocope appendiculata, Leptodora kindtii, and Bythotrephes longimanus; some smelts larger than 7.4 cm fed on Mysis relicta. In 1979 and 1980, mean lengths of smelts in October-November were 4.7 cm and 7.2 cm, respectively.

Evidence for bottom-up control of recent shifts in the pelagic food web of Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The magnitude of the spring bloom in the open waters of Lake Huron has declined dramatically in recent years, beginning in 2003. May chlorophyll values, as estimated by SeaWiFS imagery, for 2003-2006 have been 50-60% of 1998-2002 values. April phytoplankton biovolumes have also declined: average biovolume in 2003-2004 was approximately 25% of 2001-2002. Most of this decline was due to reduction in biovolume of colonial diatoms. Reductions in the spring bloom have been closely associated with abrupt declines in cladoceran populations, as well as with declines in cyclopoid copepod populations. In addition, Daphnia population egg ratios in August exhibited a pronounced decrease between 2002 and 2003 and have remained depressed through 2005. Taken together, these data suggest a role for reduced food supply in the dramatic shifts seen in the Lake Huron crustacean zooplankton community since 2003. Additionally, summer chlorophyll values have shown signs of decline in 2005 and 2006 in spite of the historically low populations of cladocerans, suggesting that control of summer phytoplankton populations in Lake Huron is determined by nutrient supply rather than grazing pressure.

J	RIVKIN, RB				RIVKIN, RB			SEASONAL PATTERNS OF PLANKTONIC PRODUCTION IN MCMURDO SOUND, ANTARCTICA	AMERICAN ZOOLOGIST												The prolonged periods of continuous darkness and light in polar regions have resulted in a unique seasonal partitioning of primary and heterotrophic production. In McMurdo Sound for example, the biomass, size distribution and production by phytoplankton and bacterioplankton undergo distinct seasonal cycles. The seasonal pattern of primary production appeared to be regulated by light whereas the three order of magnitude change in phytoplankton biomass during mid- to late December was largely controlled by the advection of planktonic algae from the Ross Sea into McMurdo Sound. The size distribution of phytoplankton was highly seasonal; nano- and picoplankton were dominant from August through November while netplankton were more abundant in December and January. Seasonal variations of bacterial biomass and production were smaller than those of phytoplankton. During thelate austral winter and spring, bacterial biomass and production exceeded those of phytoplankton. This implies that during this period, organic material from allochthonous sources sustained bacterial growth. During the late spring and summer, however, the pattern was reversed and autochthonous primary production was sufficient to support concurrent bacterioplankton production. The apparent temporal disequilibrium in autochthonous bacterioplankton and phytoplankton production was maintained by the seasonal input of allochthonous organic material into McMurdo Sound. The facts that a) bacteria were both abundant and highly active, b) bacterivory was common among many of the endemic protozoa and some planktonic metazoa and c) these bacterivores consumed > 95% of the bacterial production strongly suggest that bacteria are crucial component in the transfer of energy and material to metazoans in polar regions.																			0003-1569						1991	31	1					5	16																WOS:A1991FD12300002

Microhabitats are associated with diversity-productivity relationships in freshwater bacterial communities	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Eukaryotic communities commonly display a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function (BEF) but the results have been mixed when assessed in bacterial communities. Habitat heterogeneity, a factor in eukaryotic BEFs, may explain these variable observations but it has not been thoroughly evaluated in bacterial communities. Here, we examined the impact of habitat on the relationship between diversity assessed based on the (phylogenetic) Hill diversity metrics and heterotrophic productivity. We sampled co-occurring free-living (more homogenous) and particle-associated (more heterogeneous) bacterial habitats in a freshwater, estuarine lake over three seasons: spring, summer and fall. There was a strong, positive, linear relationship between particle-associated bacterial richness and heterotrophic productivity that strengthened when considering dominant taxa. There were no observable BEF trends in free-living bacterial communities for any diversity metric. Biodiversity, richness and Inverse Simpson's index, were the best predictors of particle-associated production whereas pH was the best predictor of free-living production. Our findings show that heterotrophic productivity is positively correlated with the effective number of taxa and that BEF relationships are associated with microhabitats. These results add to the understanding of the highly distinct contributions to diversity and functioning contributed by bacteria in free-living and particle-associated habitats.

The observed average values of water quality were typical of a mesoeutrophic system: total phosphorus (P) concentration, 16 mg.m(-3); chlorophyll a, 5 mg.m(-3); and Secchi depth, 3.3 m. The average total biomass of crustacean zooplankton in August was 62 mg carbon (C).m(-3), and large Daphnia spp. (>1.2 mm) were totally missing. The correlation between the late summer (August-September) chlorophyll a concentration and the total P concentration in the lake water was weak. The year-class strength of the vendace in autumn correlated significantly with late summer values of chlorophyll a. The August mean zooplankton biomass was negatively correlated both with the year-class strength of the vendace in autumn and with the August-September values of chlorophyll a, indicating the role of zooplankton as an intermediary in the trophic cascade of vendace feeding through the food web. We suggest that the reduced grazing pressure by zooplankton enabled the observed increase in phytoplankton biomass in years with a strong vendace stock.

The standard error of predictions is on the order of 1-degrees-C for temperature and 1.5 mg L-1 for DO. The model is driven by weather measurements at off-lake weather stations. Simulations can be made for the open water season at daily timesteps and for as many years as weather data are available without any parameter adjustments. The model has been used to simulate the effect of climate change due to a doubling of atmospheric CO, on water temperatures and DO in 27 lake classes in Minnesota. The lakes have been differentiated by surface area, maximum depth, and trophic status. Maximum water temperature near the surface is projected to increase by no more than 2-degrees-C in midsummer, and DO will drop by less than 2 mg L-1 in the surface waters but will remain above 7 mg L-1. In contrast, hypolimnetic water temperature in midsummer may rise by as much as 4-degrees-C or may become colder by as much as 4-degrees-C. Hypolimnetic DO will be lower by as much as 8 mg L-1 in midsummer and DO depletion is projected to occur for a longer period of time in midsummer in lakes with seasonal summer stratification. Changes will be largest in spring and fall because the summer stratification season will lengthen by 20 to 90 d for different lake types.																			0047-2425					JUL-SEP	1993	22	3					417	431		10.2134/jeq1993.00472425002200030005x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1993.00472425002200030005x													WOS:A1993LT89200005

The negative side of such integrated production systems is the concern related to the safety of fish meat produced in such a system. The aim of this research was to determine the concentration of heavy metals and metalloids in the wastewater from the slaughterhouse, in the pond water and sediment, in the carp tissue and in the water leaving the pond, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the integrated system and the safety of the produced fish. Sampling was carried out in spring and autumn. The mean concentrations in all water samples (mu g/L) were: As (12-125), Cd (0.12-4.2), Hg (1.14-14.21), Pb (<0.1-17.2), Cu (<0.1-44.6), Fe (17.02-425.2) and Zn (2.91-186.2), with the highest numbers in the wastewater, where it was above the prescribed limit values for the wastewater discharged from the slaughterhouses into natural recipients in both samplings. The efficiency of the wastewater treatment plant for heavy metals and metalloids was very high, in the range of 87% to 98%. The water from the pond corresponded to class 3 in terms of the concentration of heavy metals and metalloids both in spring and autumn, and can be used freely for breeding cyprinid fish species. The water from the irrigation canal corresponded to class 2/3 and can be used for irrigation. The mean concentrations of heavy metals and metalloids in the sediments (mg/kg) were: As (3.00-4.88), Cd (0.16-0.96), Hg (0.21-1.47), Pb (0.77-2.29), Cu (49.60-60.90), Fe (3.94-5.32) and Zn (92.8-115.20). The content of heavy metals in different organs of carp differed significantly depending on the season. The trend of heavy metal accumulation in common carp muscles in spring was: Zn > Fe > Cu > Pb > Hg > Cd > As, and in autumn: Zn > Fe > Cu > Pb > As > Cd > Hg. Metal concentrations in the examined fish samples were far below the WHO guidelines. It can be concluded that carp produced in a pond supplied with purified wastewater from the slaughterhouse industry, in terms of the concentration of residues of the tested heavy metals and metalloids, is safe for human consumption.					; Baloš, Milica/AAF-6410-2020; Ljubojević Pelić, Dragana/AGT-3595-2022; Pelić, Miloš/R-1211-2016; Ljubojevic Pelic, Dragana/AGT-3595-2022; Popov, Nenad/JPX-8141-2023	Pelic, Milos/0000-0002-9055-0625; Popov, Nenad/0000-0002-3102-4334; Zivkov Balos, Milica/0000-0002-4266-1232; Ljubojevic Pelic, Dragana/0000-0002-7833-7696; 														2073-4441				JAN	2024	16	1							94	10.3390/w16010094	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16010094													WOS:001141355500001

JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Despite the high potential of pollen records for climate reconstruction, pollen-climate relationships may be biased due to past and present human activities on the landscape. We use (i) transfer functions based on modern pollen-climate relationships to infer seasonal temperature and summer precipitation for the period 11 500-4500 cal. a BP and (ii) lake-level change records based on different sedimentary proxies in multiple cores that are mainly indicative for summer hydrology at Lago dell'Accesa (central Italy). Quantitative reconstructions indicate lowest summer precipitation during two phases (8500-7700 cal. a BP and after 6000 cal. a BP) and a gradual winter temperature increase from 11 500 to ca. 8000 cal. a BP. Lowest summer precipitation was reconstructed during these phases characterised by vegetation shifts from open forests dominated by summergreen oaks (Quercus) to forests dominated by evergreen oaks (Quercus ilex), which are at present most abundant where summer drought is stronger. Similarly, the lake-level record indicates two long-lasting low summer precipitation phases (8800-7700 and 6400-4400 cal. a BP) that were interrupted by short-term high summer precipitation events. Based on the broad agreement between the pollen-inferred summer precipitation and the low-frequency lake-level changes, we suggest that the duration of the high summer precipitation events may have been too short to maintain drought-sensitive trees, which may have been affected by high mortality rates when summer dry conditions returned. Although past and modern pollen-climate relationships may very likely have been affected by human activities since the Neolithic (i.e. when exploitation of the landscape started), we reject the hypothesis of a significant anthropogenic bias in the pollen-based climate reconstruction. In addition, we suggest that pollen-based and lake-level reconstructions may have different inherent abilities of capturing high- and low-frequency precipitation signals.

J	Elçi, S				Elci, Sebnem			Effects of thermal stratification and mixing on reservoir water quality	LIMNOLOGY												In this study, the effect of thermal stratification on water quality in a reservoir has been investigated by field observations and statistical analysis. During the summer period, when stratification is evident, field observations indicate that the observed dissolved oxygen concentrations drop well below the standard limit of 5 mg l(-1) at the thermocline, leading to the development of anoxia. The reasons for variations in the dissolved oxygen concentrations were investigated. Variations of air temperature and other meteorological factors and lateral flows from side arms of the lake were found to be responsible for the increase of dissolved oxygen concentrations. It was also observed that turbidity peaked mostly in the thermocline region, closely related to the location of the maximum density gradient and thus low turbulence stabilizing the sediments in the vertical water column. Relatively cold sediment-laden water flowing into the lake after rain events also resulted in increased turbidity at the bottom of the lake. Nondimensional analysis widely used in the literature was used to identify the strength of the stratification, but this analysis alone was found insufficient to describe the evolution of dissolved oxygen and turbidity in the water column. Thus correlation of these parameters was investigated by multivariate analysis. Fall (partial mixing), summer (no mixing), and winter (well mixed) models describe the correlation structures between the independent variables (meteorological parameters) and the dependent variables (water-quality parameters). Statistical analysis results indicate that air temperature, one day lagged wind speed, and low humidity affected variation of water-quality parameters.

In this context, it is necessary to develop innovative agronomic practices to counter the various negative effects from those extreme weather events, by equipping the vineyards with effective and reliable multifunctional systems, which are also economically sustainable. Particularly, a multifunctional irrigation system can be used to reduce the risk of extreme weather events and, at the same time, to improve quality and quantity of grape production, reducing their inter-annual variability as well, by providing an optimized plant water nutrition. In a vineyard situated south of Lake Garda (Northern Italy), a multifunctional irrigation system equipped with drippers and mini-sprinklers (the latter to protect from both late spring frost and summer high-temperature event) was assessed. The results obtained for the growing season 2020-21 showed that the optimized drip irrigation reduced water consumption without affecting the grape yield, both in quantity and quality. The frost protection operated by mini-sprinklers increased the air temperature at bud's level of about 1 degrees C, suggesting a positive effect on plant production. Finally, in 2020, must quality was positively affected by summer sprinkler irrigation, increasing the levels of malic acid and titratable acidity of over 0.7 g L-1 while lowered total soluble solids. Further activities in the 2022 season intend to better assess the water use efficiency of this promising multifunctional system.					; Pozzoli, Carola/LSL-0683-2024; Bianchi, Davide/AHE-5711-2022	Pozzoli, Carola/0000-0003-2107-3033; BRANCADORO, LUCIO/0000-0003-3669-8132; 													0342-7188	1432-1319				JUL	2023	41	4			SI		521	542		10.1007/s00271-022-00837-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00271-022-00837-4		JAN 2023											WOS:000914232600002

Using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, we have determined the mineral types and crystalline characteristics of three pairs of otoliths from naked carp Gymnocypris przewalskii, the predominant fish in Lake Qinghai. The results indicate that the mineral of both lapillus and sagitta of the naked carp is aragonite, and that of asteriscus is vaterite. The aragonite of lapillus has prefect crystallization. Given the shape of lapillus and the sensitivity of its aragonite to water chemistry, lapillus was used to analyze temporal Sr/Ca ratios along the maximal growth axis by an electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA). Consistent variations of Sr/Ca ratios with a range of 1.0x10(-3)-5.0x10(-3) on the long and short radii indicate that Sr/Ca ratios of lapillus potentially respond to the chemical compositions of the host waters during the period of the naked carp's growth and migration. Discontinuous (dark) zones of lapillus were formed during fall and winter when the naked carp grows slowly in Lake Qinghai, resulting in similar low Sr/Ca ratios to lake water, whereas incremental zones with higher Sr/Ca ratios respond to its migratory river waters during spring and summer. Various Sr/Ca ratios of incremental zones suggest that the migratory pattern of the naked carp may be much more flexible, rather than in a single river. Therefore, high-resolution otolith microchemistry of the naked carp can be used to trace its migratory behavior, which is of significance for determining its migratory pattern and life history of this precious species inhabiting the Tibetan Plateau.

Application of distance sampling techniques for diving ducks on Lake St. Clair and western Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake St. Clair and western Lake Erie are important migration staging areas for diving ducks including canvasbacks (Aythya valisineria), redheads (Aythya americana), and lesser and greater scaup (Aythya affinis and Aythya marila). Starting in 1983, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) attempted to census diving ducks on the United States portion of Lake St Clair throughout autumn migration; however, in 2010 the MDNR expanded the traditionally surveyed area to include all of Lake St. Clair and a portion of western Lake Erie. The idea of achieving a census over the expanded study area was unrealistic, and instead distance sampling techniques were adopted in an effort to generate statistically valid estimates of detection probabilities and abundances for diving ducks during spring and autumn migration. We found distance sampling techniques to be a viable option for estimating diving duck abundance as long as flock size is accounted for as a covariate affecting the detection function. Diving ducks were generally more abundant on our study area during autumn migration with a mean of 306,327 ducks/survey (SE = 40,729) compared to an average spring abundance of 91,053 ducks/survey (SE = 19,175). Peak abundance occurred on 20 November 2012 with an estimated 596,335 diving ducks on Lake St. Clair and western Lake Erie. Ultimately, our methodology could be used to establish long-term, standardized data collection techniques and applied to conservation planning for waterfowl in the Great Lakes region.

J	AGBETI, MD; SMOL, JP				AGBETI, MD; SMOL, JP			CHRYSOPHYTE POPULATION AND ENCYSTMENT PATTERNS IN 2 CANADIAN LAKES	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												The dynamics of chrysophyte populations and the onset of encystment in relation to several physical, chemical, and biological variables were studied in two Canadian lakes, Lake Opinicon (LO) and Upper Rock Lake (URL). LO is shallow and polymictic during the ice-free season, whereas URL is deep and dimictic. seasonal patterns of many limnological variables, as well as species composition and seasonal dynamics of chrysophyte assemblages, were broadly similar in both lakes. Three groups of chrysophytes were recognized: 1) taxa that were more abundant during ice cover and/or early spring and occasionally in late fall (Dinobryon spp. Ehrenberg and Synura spinosa Korsh), 2) taxa that seemed to prefer moderately warm water (Uroglena americana Calkins and Ochromonas sp. Wyssotzki) and had maximum densities in late summer and occasionally in the fall, and 3) taxa that occurred in low numbers and did not exhibit any discernible seasonality in the two lakes (Mallomonas spp. Perty). Encystment rarely occurred during ice cover in both lakes. Stomatocyst concentrations were highest shortly after ice breakup (late April or early May) declined to trace levels by June, and remained at those levels until the end of the sampling season (fate November). Encystment ment rates (cyst concentrations) were higher in dimictic URL. Encystment in both lakes coincided with concurrent changes in physical and chemical variables and chrysophyte vegetative cell densities, but it was not possible to pinpoint the exact conditions responsible for triggering encystment. Only a small proportion of chrysophytes encysted. Cyst production within a lake may vary from year to year.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; 													0022-3646					FEB	1995	31	1					70	78		10.1111/j.0022-3646.1995.00070.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-3646.1995.00070.x													WOS:A1995QN48200008
J	BLOOM, NS; EFFLER, SW				BLOOM, NS; EFFLER, SW			SEASONAL VARIABILITY IN THE MERCURY SPECIATION OF ONONDAGA LAKE (NEW-YORK)	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Dissolved and particulate Hg speciation was determined on four occasions in the Spring to Fall interval of 1989, at three depths of the water column of Onondaga Lake, New York; an urban system in which the sediments and fish flesh are contaminated with H(g). Species determined included total Hg (Hg(t)), reactive ('ionic') Hg (Hg(i), monomethylmercury (CH3HgX), elemental Hg (Hg-degrees) and dimethylmercury (CH3)2Hg). Onondaga Lake was found to contain very high levels of Hg(t) (2 to 25 ng L-1 Hg), Hg(i) (0.5 to 10 ng L-1 Hg), and CH3HgX (0.3 to 7 ng L-1 Hg), which generally increased with depth in the lake. These concentrations represent a significant level of contamination, based upon comparisons with other polluted and pristine sites. Elemental Hg levels were typically about 0.05 ng L-1, and (CH3)2Hg was near the limits of detection (-0.001 ng L-1) in most samples. The greatest CH3HgX concentrations in the hypolimnion, as well as the largest gradients of both CH3HgX and Hg(t) were observed upon the first onset of stratification, in early summer. These concentrations did not become more pronounced, however, as stratification and H2S levels in the hypolimnion increased throughout the summer. The very low concentrations of (CH3)2Hg in these MeHg and sulfide-rich waters calls into question the belief that CH3HgX and H2S will react to yield volatile dimethylmercury, which can then escape to the atmosphere by diffusion. Mercury speciation was highly dynamic, indicating active cycling within the lake, and an apparent sensitivity to changes in attendant limnological conditions that track the stratification cycle.

WINTER-SPRING STORMS AND THEIR INFLUENCE ON SEDIMENT RESUSPENSION, TRANSPORT, AND ACCUMULATION PATTERNS IN SOUTHERN LAKE MICHIGAN	OCEANOGRAPHY												The Episodic Events-Great Lakes Experiment was designed to quantify the impacts of major late winter-early spring storms on sediment-water exchange, sediment, and associated constituent transport and resultant influence on well-characterized sediment distributions in southern Lake Michigan. Prior to this project, only very sparse data were available during the late winter-earl), spring period for and of the Great Lakes, primarily because of strong storms and ice conditions. The observation strategy consisted of moored arrays of current meters, thermistors, and sequencing traps, along with shipboard surveys. In addition, process measurement cruises were conducted along with special cruises for sediment-water interface sampling Using a remotely operated vehicle, particle transformation measurements, and sediment collection. A summary of conclusions include: (1) particles, predominantly from the western shore of the lake, are resuspended and transported in a coastal band toward the major sediment depositional region in the southeastern portion of the lake, (2) transport rates, measured by Th-234, are on the order of kilometers per day, (3) the magnitude Of resuspended sediments from a single major storm is 1-5 x 10(6) kg, larger than annual external input of fine-grained materials to the southern basin, (4) resuspension surrogates based on 50 years of wave data show an interannual variability in major storm events that ranges over an order of magnitude, and (5) trap and e evidence indicates that the events appear to be primarily responsible for the complicated sediment accumulation patterns in the southern basin of Lake Michigan.

In order to understand the distribution of phytoplankton and their co-relationship with environmental factors, the phytoplankton and environmental factors were observed in different parts of Taihu Lake in the summer (July) and winter (December) of 2013. By using diversity indexes and a redundancy analysis (RDA), this study revealed that Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta were the majority, and the main impact factors were total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), phosphate (PO43--P), ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) and dissolved oxygen (DO). During the summer, the Microcystis of Cyanophyta were the most prevalent. However, during the winter, the prevalence of all of the species and the abundance of algae decreased greatly and Bacillariophyta became dominant. The northwestern, algae-type portion of the lake had the highest abundance of Microcystis, which suffered serious eutrophication. In contrast, the eastern, grass-type portion of the lake had the lowest abundance of algae but the highest content of Bacillariophyta, indicating superior water quality. Based on the above analysis, suggestions were given to prevent and control algal blooms. In addition to decreasing the input of exogenous nutrients, sediment dredging may be performed in the northwestern portion during the winter to eliminate the blue green algae in the resting stage to some extent Meanwhile, macrophytes should also be reconstructed in northern bays to restrain the rampant growth of phytoplankton.

J	Carlsson, P; Caron, DA				Carlsson, P; Caron, DA			Seasonal variation of phosphorus limitation of bacterial growth in a small lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A series of bioassay experiments were performed from spring to autumn in a small dimictic lake (Deep Pond, Massachusetts) to examine the potential for bacterial growth limitation by organic carbon (glucose), inorganic nutrients (ammonium or phosphate), or both. The experiments demonstrated that phosphorus was the primary element limiting bacterial growth in Deep Pond during a large part of the summer. Significant increases (relative to controls) in bacterial cell volumes, protein production rates, and abundances were observed during 24-h incubations for samples amended with phosphate alone. Organic carbon was near colimitation for most of the samples, however, and dramatic increases in bacterial abundance and rates of protein production were obtained only when both substances (phosphate and glucose) were added together. There was no evidence for nitrogen limitation of bacterial growth during the study. Temperature was not an important determinant for bacterial production rates above 12 degreesC, but below 12 degreesC temperature acted to mute the effect of nutrient and organic carbon additions on production rates. Bacterial. growth was not significantly increased by the addition of any combination of glucose, ammonium, or phosphate below 12 degreesC. A significant, albeit complex, effect of the microbial community on the bacterial response to nutrient/carbon enrichment was apparent in the samples. Substrate/nutrient supply and biomass removal by bacterivores both appeared to play a role in the outcome of the experiments.

J	HSU, KJ; MCKENZIE, JA				HSU, KJ; MCKENZIE, JA			SWISS LAKES AS A GEOLOGICAL LABORATORY .2. VARVES	NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN												Varves record annual events. The carbonate varves of Swiss lakes consist of an alternating sequence of summer calcite precipitation and the deposition of fine detrital materials in winter, when biologic production has all but ceased. Applying the principle that the carbon isotopes of dissolved carbonates are fractionated by the photosynthesis of plants in surface waters, a method was developed to monitor plankton fertility of lakes and oceans by studying their pelagic sediments. No glacio-lacustrine varves have been found in the Holocene deposits of the Swiss lakes investigated, but such varves were deposited in Lake Zurich shortly after the melting of the last Wuerm glacier. Glacio-lacustrine varves are probably the product of a specific climatic regime when a lake freezes annually, and should be distinguished by the clay laminae laid down in an ice-covered lake during the winter-freeze, and not by the "summer" events, when entrained flows cause formation of turbidity deposits.																			0028-1042	1432-1904					1985	72	7					365	371		10.1007/BF00410599	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00410599													WOS:A1985AMX6700005
J	Isermann, DA; Chipps, SR; Brown, ML				Isermann, DA; Chipps, SR; Brown, ML			Seasonal Daphnia biomass in winterkill and nonwinterkill glacial lakes of South Dakota	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We compared the seasonal biomass (mug dry weight/L) and body size of Daphnia pulex populations between South Dakota lakes that experienced nearly complete winterkill (n = 2) and those that did not experience fish winterkill the previous winter (n = 2). In spring (March-May), D. pulex biomass was substantially lower in winterkill lakes (0.4-1.9 mug/L) than in non-winterkill lakes (13.8-129.4 mug/L). In summer months (June-July), D. pulex biomass increased in all lakes but was generally higher in winterkill lakes (332.1-469.3 Lg/L) than in nonwinterkill lakes (88.6-204.2 mug/L). By September, D. pulex biomass was substantially higher in winterkill lakes (243.8 mug/L) than in nonwinterkill lakes (1.0 mug/L). The mean size of D. pulex increased significantly from March to August in winterkill lakes but not in nonwinterkill lakes. The seasonal differences in D. pulex biomass and size may have been related to size-selective predation by planktivorous fishes because the ratio of spine length to body length in D. pulex was significantly lower in winterkill lakes (mean, 0.34) than in nonwinterkill lakes (mean, 0.43). Moreover, seasonal patterns in chlorophyll-a biomass were inversely related to D. pulex biomass. The production and subsequent hatching of resting eggs may be important for recolonization of Daphnia populations after severe winter conditions. The survival and growth of zooplanktivorous fish that are stocked to repopulate winterkill lakes may be increased by delaying stocking until Daphnia populations recover from severe winterkill.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				FEB	2004	24	1					287	292		10.1577/M02-151	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M02-151													WOS:000220169400035
J	Evans, MS; Eadie, BJ; Glover, RM				Evans, MS; Eadie, BJ; Glover, RM			Sediment trap studies in southeastern Lake Michigan: Fecal pellet express or the more traveled route?	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												This study investigated the composition of particulate matter in a series of sediment traps set in the offshore waters of southeastern Lake Michigan, April to October 1982. Of particular interest was the role of zooplankton fecal pellets in rapidly transporting matter from the euphotic zone to lake sediments. Particulate pur: was examined microscopically. Dry weight and settling velocities were then estimated based on literature conversion factors and predictive equations. There was an excellent correspondence between estimated flux and direct measurements of flux. Flux was dominated by biological particles of autochthonous origin: fecal matter, fecal pellets, organic aggregates, phytoplankton, and zooplankton exoskeletons. Particles were small with slow (generally < IO m/day) settling velocities. Flux varied seasonally, being highest in spring and autumn, during vertical mixing, and lowest in mid-summer during strong thermal stratification. High trapping rates during isothermal conditions previously have been associated with resuspension. However free minerals were a relatively small component of flux. This suggests that isothermal events are associated with the resuspension of previously-settled mineral particles with these particles and slowly-settling biological particles being kept in suspension until the onset of thermal stratification. Because zooplankton fecal pellets and fecal matter are subject to significant degradation and reingestion during the days to weeks that are required for them to reach the lake poor, these egestion products may play a greater role in the recycling of matter in the water column than in the direct transport of matter to the sediments. During summer, when the abundant zooplankton population is food-limited and cladocerans, which produce diffuse egestion products are numerous, relatively little of materials produced in the epilimnion settles immediately to the lake floor.

During that time the Dead Sea was highly stratified, with a density difference of 1.7 .times. 10-2 g liter-1 between its two layers. Measurements of lake level (limnograms) show oscillations with periods of internal seiches as confirmed by thermistor-chain measurements as well as by a numerical model of internal oscillations. Wind measurements exhibit predominantly diurnal and semidiurnal periods. During autumn 1984 the Dead Sea turned over and its layered structure thereby destroyed. In contrast to the measurements of summer 1981 the limnograms for this timespan show only oscillations associated with periods corresponding to surface seiches, but no sign of internal oscillations.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	1987	32	1					76	82		10.4319/lo.1987.32.1.0076	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1987.32.1.0076													WOS:A1987G107200006
J	Tolonen, A				Tolonen, A			Application of a bioenergetics model for analysis of growth and food consumption of subarctic whitefish Coregonus lavaretus (L.) in Lake Kilpisjarvi, Finnish Lapland	HYDROBIOLOGIA												A bioenergetics model was used to estimate daily food consumption and growth of benthic whitefish Coregonus lavaretus (L.) of age groups 1+ to 10+, in oligotrophic Lake Kilpisjarvi, northern Finnish Lapland. Fish and zooplankton samples and water temperature data were collected twice per month from February to December 1993. Simulation results indicated wide seasonal variations in consumption and growth rates. Growth was in general slow; especially in age-group 6 the net increase in weight was slight. The fit of the model to the weight data was good, and the model was able to follow even rapid seasonal variations in the weight. There were clear changes in the diet during the year. In March, when the food intake was reduced, copepods, mainly adult calanoids, formed the bulk of the food consumed. The most intensive consumption period lasted from June to late September. Chironomid pupae and planktonic cladocerans were the major summer food items. The largest individuals fed mainly on molluscs during summer. Zooplankton survey and consumption estimates did not show directly that the population density of copepodids and adults of Eudiaptomus graciloides were affected by whitefish predation although their population density decreased in spring. Nauplii, showing the maximum population density in April, were not consumed. The role of copepod consumption in the timing of Diphyllobothrium ditremum plerocercoid transmission to whitefish was also discussed. The increased copepod consumption rate during winter results in high energy intake but also an increased risk of food transmitted parasite infection.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1998	390	1-3					153	169		10.1023/A:1003525008870	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003525008870													WOS:000080235900015

The aim was to establish whether the geochemical behavior of Mn differed in a range of limnological conditions: oligotrophic/mesotrophic Loch Lomond; eutrophic unstratified Loch Leven; seasonally stratified eutrophic Balgavies Loch; oligotrophic, acidified Round Loch of Glenhead; and oligotrophic, acid-sensitive Loch Coire nan Arr. Although redox-driven diagenesis of Mn was evident in all lochs, the diversity of conditions in the lochs resulted in some cases in modifications to behavior predicted by conceptual models for transport of Mn at a redox boundary. These differences were reflected in the chemical associations and trends in concentration of Mn. A classic example of Mn redox cycling in the sediments of Loch Lomond provided a basis for comparison with other systems. Higher inventories of Mn in sediment collected from eutrophic Loch Leven during the summer, compared with sediment from autumn and winter sampling, were explained by the effects of enhanced primary productivity (high pH and dissolved oxygen concentrations) during a summer algal bloom. In Balgavies Loch, where the bottom water was hypoxic, at the time of sampling, previous diagenetic enrichment of Mn in the surface sediment was subject to modification by dissolution and release from the solid phase to pore water, which was elevated in Mn. The increase in solid-phase Mn concentration with depth and lack of significant surface enhancement of Mn in Round Loch contrasted markedly with results from other lochs. This was attributed mainly to acidification, producing a pH-related decrease in Mn sedimentation. Mn partitioning and porewater data for Loch Coire nan Arr were in some respects similar to those at Round Loch, with both lochs having peaty sediment. However, Mn concentration patterns attributed to acidification effects at Round Loch were not found in Loch Coire nan Arr.

Caldera unrest detected with seawater temperature anomalies at Deception Island, Antarctic Peninsula	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												Increased thermal activity was detected to coincide with the onset of volcano inflation in the seawater-filled caldera at Deception Island. This thermal activity was manifested in pulses of high water temperature that coincided with ocean tide cycles. The seawater temperature anomalies were detected by a thermometric sensor attached to the tide gauge (bottom pressure sensor). This was installed where the seawater circulation and the locations of known thermal anomalies, fumaroles and thermal springs, together favor the detection of water warmed within the caldera. Detection of the increased thermal activity was also possible because sea ice, which covers the entire caldera during the austral winter months, insulates the water and thus reduces temperature exchange between seawater and atmosphere. In these conditions, the water temperature data has been shown to provide significant information about Deception volcano activity. The detected seawater temperature increase, also observed in soil temperature readings, suggests rapid and near-simultaneous increase in geothermal activity with onset of caldera inflation and an increased number of seismic events observed in the following austral summer.

The experiment was conducted firstly with municipal sewage in autumn-winter seasons for about 150 days under the following conditions: 2 m(3)/h influent flow, 0.75 kW jet-flow aerator (air/water of 5), 18h HRT (hydrological retention time) and a return ratio of 10. Then it was run with the polluted lake water in summer-autumn for about 160 days with an aerator of 1.25 kW and an influent of 6 m3/h (air/water 3.3, HRT 6 h). The performance was quite stable during the experimental period for the municipal sewage treatment. The average removal rates of COD (chemical oxygen demand), SS (suspended solids), TP (total phosphorus), NH4+-N and inorganic-N were 70.6, 75.8, 72.6, 52.1 and 50.3%, respectively For the polluted lake water treatment, the average concentrations of COD, NH4+-N and TP were 42.7, 13.1 and 1.09 mg/L, respectively, in the influent and were 25.1, 6.4 and 0.38 mg/L, respectively, in the effluent. The capacity of the plants to remove N and P by direct uptake was limited, but the indirect mechanisms also occurred. The proposed process, transforming the natural lake into a wastewater treatment plant, could evidently reduce the costs of the sewage collection, the land space requirement and the construction compared with conventional sewage treatment plants, and is especially suited to conditions in south China and south-east Asia.

J	SIEGLER, HR; PILLSBURY, HW				SIEGLER, HR; PILLSBURY, HW			USE OF DERRIS TO RECLAIM PONDS FOR GAME FISH	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Lakes up to several hundred acres in area can be reclaimed satisfactorily for game fish with rotenone. The following factors should be considered when poisoning operations are contemplated: accessibility of water to be reclaimed, water sources, outlet, water temp. (or time of yr.), depth and vol. of water, rotenone content of derris, and research possibilities. Unless all head waters and marshy shore areas can be covered entirely, there is little probability of a complete kill. No water should be poisoned that cannot be held for a minimum of 3 weeks before overflowing. Rotenone will kill the fish population of a lake with water temp. as low as 48[degree]F; however, the colder the water, the more slowly the poison becomes dissipated. Lakes poisoned late in autumn may remain toxic to fish until the seasonal turn-over of water in spring. Of 7 ponds poisoned, 2 could be restocked within 35 days but 2 others remained toxic to fish all winter. Water vol. calculations to the nearest acre-foot are accurate enough for all practical purposes in poisoning operations. Concs, of 0.153 to 2 ppm. of derris powder to water vol. have been used with success in New Hampshire. Spraying is the most satisfactory method of application. The cost of reclamation operations on 7 lakes in N.H. averaged $1.41 per acre-foot and varied from $0.78 to $4.75.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1946	10	4					308	316		10.2307/3796238	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3796238													WOS:A1946YB64300005
J	Peng, H; Zheng, XL; Chen, L; Wei, Y				Peng, Hui; Zheng, Xilai; Chen, Lei; Wei, Yang			Analysis of numerical simulations and influencing factors of seasonal manganese pollution in reservoirs	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Seasonal manganese pollution has become an increasingly pressing water quality issue for water supply reservoirs in recent years. Manganese is a redox-sensitive element and is released from sediment under anoxic conditions near the sediment-water interface during summer and autumn, when water temperature stratification occurs. The reservoir water temperature and water dynamic conditions directly influence the formation of manganese pollution. Numerical models are useful tools to quantitatively evaluate manganese pollution and its influencing factors. This paper presents a reservoir manganese pollution model by adding a manganese biogeochemical module to a water quality model-CE-QUAL-W2. The model is applied to the Wangjuan reservoir (Qingdao, China), which experiences manganese pollution during summer and autumn. Field data are used to verify the model, and the results show that the model can reproduce the main features of the thermal stratification and manganese distribution. The model is used to evaluate the manganese pollution process and its four influencing factors, including air temperature, water level, wind speed, and wind directions, through different simulation scenarios. The results show that all four factors can influence manganese pollution. High air temperature, high water level, and low wind speed aggravate manganese pollution, while low air temperature, low water level, and high wind speed reduce manganese pollution. Wind that travels in the opposite direction of the flow aggravates manganese pollution, while wind in the same direction as the flow reduces manganese pollution. This study provides useful information to improve our understanding of seasonal manganese pollution in reservoirs, which is important for reservoir manganese pollution warnings and control.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				JUL	2016	23	14					14362	14372		10.1007/s11356-016-6380-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6380-3								27068892					WOS:000379553500067
J	Vingarzan, R; Taylor, B				Vingarzan, R; Taylor, B			Trend analysis of ground level ozone in the greater Vancouver/Fraser Valley area of British Columbia	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												A multiple linear regression model incorporating meteorological parameters, annual cycles and random error due to serial correlation was used to investigate the annual and summer season ozone trends between 1985 and 2000 at five stations in the Greater Vancouver/Fraser Valley area of southern British Columbia. Results indicate that although average daily maximum ozone concentrations were relatively low compared to many urban areas of Canada, maximum levels, which typically occur during the summer, were similar to those measured in large urban centers in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence corridor of southeastern Canada. Ozone levels were found to occasionally exceed the National Ambient Air Quality Objective of 82 ppb, although these occurrences were relatively infrequent. The annual cycle of ozone was typical of areas influenced by both background and locally produced ozone, as indicated by the,spring peak followed by elevated maxima occurring during summer months. General Least Squares analysis performed on the meteorologically adjusted data found decreasing trends for summer ozone at all stations. Decreasing trends were also found for annual ozone for stations in the eastern portion of the study area, which are more strongly affected by locally produced ozone. These trends were consistent with local declines in ozone precursors and are in agreement with reported declines in summer ozone in urban areas of United States and Europe. In contrast, increasing trends were found for annual ozone at stations in the western portion of the study area, which, due to their geographical location, are less affected by locally produced ozone. There is some indication that increasing trends at sites in the western portion of the study area may be reflective of a hemispheric increase in background ozone levels. The results of this study suggest that ozone trends in the Greater Vancouver/Fraser Valley area are in line with broad changes in ozone occurring in North America and Europe.

In this study, we combine limnological and paleolimnological monitoring to address the fundamental question: Which environmental information is contained in a diatom sediment signal? We compared annual diatom sequential sediment trap records with the diatom record of the annually varved lake sediment of Nylandssjon (northern Sweden) from three meteorologically different years (2012-2014). The seasonal patterns in diatom sedimentation were strikingly different in varve years 2012 and 2014 compared to varve year 2013. In 2012 and 2014, up to 70% of the annual flux occurred in a single spring month and was dominated by Cyclotella glomerata. In contrast, in 2013, peak fluxes were much lower and more annually integrated. Next, we compared the full-year diatom trap results with year round in-lake physical, chemical, and biological monitored parameters, as well as meteorological variables. Annual averages of environmental conditions did not explain the interannual variability in diatom sedimentation. Instead, the seasonality of diatom sedimentation was determined by the timing of the spring diatom bloom relative to lake over-turn in winters with warm vs. cold air temperature. With our combined limnological and paleolimnological monitoring approach, we find that an annual diatom signal can either contain primarily seasonal climate information from a short time period or be annually integrated. We synthesize our results in a novel conceptual model, which describes the response of sediment diatom signals to two distinct sequences of late-winter conditions.

Duration and thickness of snow and ice cover determines albedo, underwater light availability, thermal and chemical regimes and mixing properties. However, quantitative data on responses by aquatic systems to regional-scale change remain scant. Here, by utilizing 48 year (1947-1995) air temperature and 33 year (1963-1996) lake environmental datasets obtained at Signy Island, South Orkney Islands, we report one of the fastest responses to regional climate change so far documented in the southern hemisphere. Between 1980-1995 lake water temperatures increased by 2-3 times the local air temperature rise. Autumn freeze and spring break up dates of lake ice have changed, extending the open water period by up to 4 weeks. Winter total extractable phytopigments, alkalinity and orthophosphate show 2- to 10-fold increases, all linked with an areal reduction of the island's ice cover of similar to 45% in total in the last 50 years. These results indicate that its geographical position allows Signy Island to be a sensitive indicator of rapid ecological change in Antarctic freshwater environments. Such rapid change will be widespread in polar regions if current global change predictions are correct.

Seasonal dynamics, spatial distribution and population size of the phantom midge Chaoborus flavicans in different parts of the eutrophic Lake Hiidenvesi (30.3 km(2) ) were studied. 2. Density of larvae was low in the shallow, most eutrophic parts of the lake, while the deep Kiihkelyksenselka basin was inhabited by a dense population. In the deepest part of Kiihkelyksenselka (33 m) density was 13 989 +/- 3542 m(-2) in May, declined to 1102 +/- 274 m(-2) in July and recovered to 7225 +/- 1314 m(-2) by October. In spring and autumn the majority of larvae were benthic while, during high summer, few larvae were found in the sediment. 3. Horizontal distribution fluctuated seasonally. On 3 June < 5% of the population inhabited areas shallower than 10 m. On 6 July the limnetic fraction was still restricted to regions deeper than 10 m, but 43% of benthic larvae were found between 6 and 10 m depths. In October both limnetic and benthic larvae were concentrated in areas deeper than 20 m. 4. Within the lake, distribution was mainly regulated by stratification characteristics, degree of eutrophy being less important. The seasonal horizontal movements were probably induced by food shortage. Larvae could not meet their energetic demands in stratified areas and dispersed to shallower water, reducing predation risk by use of the benthic habitat.

In autumn and winter, at two study sites sleeping (49% and 68%) and resting (9% and 20%) dominated, whereas feeding (7% and 10%) represented a minor proportion of, diurnal activities. There was no marked seasonal change in the activity pattern, as would be expected for a resident bird. The breeding and winter distributions of the species were similar, but seasonal and diel patterns of dispersion among habitats remain poorly known. Human encroachment on wetland habitat, habitat degradation and illegal hunting in protected areas are the major threats to the persistence of the species and probably similar threatened species in Algeria.

In situ flux estimates reveal large variations in methane flux across the bottom boundary layer of a eutrophic lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Methane (CH4) produced in anoxic sediments plays a significant role in the carbon economy of many lakes and reservoirs. CH4 released from sediments first crosses the bottom boundary layer (BBL), the layer of water overlying the lakebed where currents are slowed by friction with the sediments below. Physical and biogeochemical conditions in the BBL, which can fluctuate hourly to daily with basin-wide internal waves (seiches), likely influence CH4 transport from sediments into the hypolimnion. In this study, we estimated CH4 fluxes across the BBL of a eutrophic lake using a novel in situ flux gradient approach adapted from marine applications. For 2-6 h periods throughout the spring and summer, we estimated CH4 fluxes across the BBL using simultaneous measurements of CH4 concentrations, turbulent mixing, and thermal stratification. Sub-daily variation in CH4 fluxes was high, and CH4 fluxes sometimes changed several-fold within hours. These rapid shifts in BBL fluxes were likely influenced by fluctuations in seiche-driven variations in the intensity of BBL turbulent mixing. Fluxes increased from spring to summer, concurrent with the development of lake stratification, and fueled an accumulation of CH4 below the thermocline. Throughout the summer, CH4 flux across the BBL exceeded CH4 accumulation below the thermocline, suggesting significant methanotrophy in the hypolimnion, consistent with incubation-based oxidation rates. Our results are the first to demonstrate sub-daily and seasonal variability in the timing and magnitude of CH4 fluxes within a lake BBL, and highlight a need to quantify such variability in other lentic systems.					; Harrison, John/F-2280-2011; D'Ambrosio, Sofia/AFD-5212-2022	Henderson, Stephen M/0000-0001-9111-7885; Harrison, John/0000-0002-0677-5478; D'Ambrosio, Sofia/0000-0003-2737-1488													0024-3590	1939-5590				OCT	2022	67	10					2119	2139		10.1002/lno.12193	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.12193		AUG 2022											WOS:000834855200001

The Rybinsk Reservoir is a very large, relatively shallow, low-flow, mesotrophic-eutrophic, morphologically complex basin-valley reservoir with multiyear flow regulation created on the Upper Volga in 1941. A total of 71 stations have been sampled for water and air to determine methane concentrations, combined with profiling the water column. As a result, a network of reference stations is established for regular measurements, along with additional stations in the reservoir and river mouths. Control samples are taken from the hydroelectric units of the hydropower plant, as well as downstream of the Sheksna HPP dam within the city of Rybinsk. Overall, the Rybinsk Reservoir is characterized by relatively low methane concentrations-at most stations, the average dissolved CH4 content does not exceed 20 mu L/L. The lowest concentrations are observed in the winter period. Methane fluxes from the surface of the Rybinsk Reservoir range from 4 to 718 mgC-CH4 m-2 day-1. Specific fluxes (SFs) measured in the summer period are higher than those measured in the fall, and in summer, the spatial variability of the measured fluxes is more significant. Flux values depend on the stratification of the reservoir, the oxygen content in the water, organic matter in the bottom sediments, and other factors. Methane degassing through the dam is significantly less than the surface fluxes.

A light-trap was also operated. Catches consisted mainly of G. argentatus Schumm., followed by G. lacustris (L.). Pond-skaters were trapped from late April to the end of May, except for one G. argentatus in late Aug. The seasonal distribution of the catches is due to differences in habitat selection before and after overwintering. In spring, pond-skaters are attracted to and alight on reflective surfaces such as ponds. In late summer they move to the land to overwinter. Pond-skaters were only trapped during daylight; no pond-skater being caught in the light-trap. Catches occurred between 0900 and 1700 h with a peak at noon. The critical lower temperature threshold for flight in G. argentatus seems to be 12-13.degree. C in spring. Pond-skaters trapped during the spring dispersal period had undeveloped ovaries, no food in the gut, and little or no adipose tissue. The species composition of the catches was mainly due to the specific habitat near the traps.																			0030-1299	1600-0706					1977	29	1					156	160		10.2307/3543307	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3543307													WOS:A1977DW06800021

First, spatial patterns in land erodibility are examined. We then present an analysis of seasonal and interannual variations in land erodibility. Patterns in land erodibility change are compared to rainfall variability, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific (inter-) Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Land erodibility is found to peak in the study area between early spring (September, October, November) and late summer (January, February, March), and reach a minimum over winter (June, July, August). Weak correlations are found between modeled land erodibility, rainfall, ENSO, and the PDO. The results indicate a complex landscape response to climate variability, with land erodibility dynamics being affected by antecedent rainfall and vegetation conditions which generate lag responses in land erodibility change. The research highlights the importance of developing methods for monitoring conditions driving variations in wind erosion at the landscape scale to enhance land management policy in arid and semiarid landscapes at a time of uncertain future climate changes.

Lake Izunuma which has an area of 357 ha, was 62% covered by lotus vegetation in October 2021, but only 11% in September 2022. Whooper Swans (Cygnus cygnus) that winter in Lake Izunuma-Uchinuma forage mainly on the rhizomes of the lotus. The number of Whooper Swans wintering from November 2022 to January 2023 decreased significantly compared to the pre- flood season of 2021/2022. The number of swans in Lake Izunuma-Uchinuma decreased significantly compared to the populations of swans at other wintering sites, despite the fact that the daily average temperatures at the three sites on the migration route of the swans did not differ significantly between these seasons. The significant decrease in lotus vegetation caused by flooding in July 2022 is considered the cause of the decrease in the number of Whooper Swans wintering on the lake in the 2022/2023 season.																			1524-4695	1938-5390				DEC	2024	47	3							304															WOS:001461757100010

It is a typical lake-type wetland and is also an ideal place for rare cranes to overwintering. The changes of wetland landscape are closely related to the habitat quality of wintering cranes. It is of great significance to study the habitat change of wintering cranes in wetland for wetland ecological restoration and restoration. In this paper, we analyze four kinds of winter cranes and wetland landscape pattern types from the years 1986 to 2015. Also, we adopted the Pearson correlation analysis method to analyze the relationship between wetland landscape types and crane population, and the main landscape types of cranes habitat were obtained. We selected disturbance degree, food richness, vegetation cover, and hydrological condition as the main factors affecting wintering habitat of cranes. We established a habitat suitability index model for wintering cranes and generated habitat suitability assessment maps by ArcGIS. The results show that the change of landscape pattern in Shengjin Lake protected area was obvious, the number of wetland patches increased, the fragmentation degree of landscape increased, the landscape patch difference became smaller, and the diversity index and evenness index increased gradually. From 1986 to 2015, the number of wintering cranes decreased and the habitat suitability index of wintering cranes decreased from 0.845 to 0.465, and the habitat suitability of wintering cranes fell from 13,577.11 to 7424.42ha, which showed the overall habitat deteriorated significantly and had a positive correlation between the crane population and habitat suitability.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				MAY	2019	26	15			SI		14962	14975		10.1007/s11356-019-04697-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-04697-y								30919186					WOS:000468842100023
J	Donald, DB; Block, H; Wood, J				Donald, DB; Block, H; Wood, J			Role of ground water on hexachlorocyclohexane (lindane) detections in surface water in western Canada	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Interrelationships between surface water and groundwater dynamics of alpha- and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) were investigated by determining their detection frequency and concentrations in surface water that originated primarily from surface runoff of snow and rain and in surface water that originated from ground water. In the prairie ecozone in Saskatchewan, where lindane (gamma-HCH) is currently used, lindane and alpha-HCH were detected in about 50% of water samples taken from lakes and ponds that are recharged primarily by surface runoff (N = 43 sites). Maximum concentrations For lindane and alpha-HCH were 0.011 and 0.004 mu g/L, respectively. Isomers of HCH were not detected in any of the eight prairie springs that were examined (N = 10 samples). These springs originate from ground water located beneath agricultural lands. In the montane ecozone of Alberta where lindane is not used for agricultural purposes, only alpha-HCH was detected frequently in the Waterton and Athabasca rivers. From 1976 to 1992, alpha-HCH was detected in 81% of water samples from the Waterton River with no significant difference in detection frequency through the year (chi(2) for 12 months = 14.6, d.f. = 11, p = 0.20, N = 163 samples). The site on the Waterton River is located downstream from a series of large lakes with multiyear storage of surface water. In contrast, discharge for the Athabasca River originates primarily from surface water during summer and ground water during winter. Detection frequency for alpha-HCH during these seasons was 53% and 2%, respectively, with the annual pattern a normal distribution. These results indicate that HCH isomers were not detected frequently in surface waters that originate from ground water.																			0730-7268	1552-8618				SEP	1997	16	9					1867	1872		10.1002/etc.5620160915	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620160915													WOS:A1997XT30500015
J	MacInnis, AJ; Corkum, LD				MacInnis, AJ; Corkum, LD			Age and growth of round goby Neogobius melanostomus in the upper Detroit River	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The round goby Neogobius melanostomus has quickly become one of the most abundant benthic fishes in the Lake Huron-Lake Erie corridor of the Laurentian Great Lakes since it was first discovered in the St. Clair River in 1990. We describe the age, growth, and size structure of the round goby population from samples collected in the upper Detroit River. Round gobies were collected using an otter trawl about every 3 weeks during spring, summer, and autumn 1996. Age-1 fish were found to be the most abundant group in the population, and fish size within a given age-group was highly variable. Both males and females were found to be maturing younger and at smaller sizes than in their native range. Marginal increment analysis of otoliths revealed that annulus formation occurred in late May-early June. Although mean size of fish differed significantly with sample date (P < 0.001), there was little increase in mean size from May to October. Age-1 fish had a larger growth than age-2 fish. Mean annual growth for age-1 males (37 mm) was greater than for females (33 mm), but size ranges overlapped. Early maturity and rapid growth are two factors that may ensure the continued expansion of the round goby throughout the Great Lakes.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAY	2000	129	3					852	858		10.1577/1548-8659(2000)129<0852:AAGORG>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2000)129<0852:AAGORG>2.3.CO;2													WOS:000089076500016

J	Simon, M				Simon, M			Bacterioplankton dynamics in a large mesotrophic lake: II. concentrations and turnover of dissolved amino acids	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Seasonal and vertical dynamics of concentrations and turnover of dissolved free (DFAA) and combined amino acids (DCAA) by bacterioplankton were studied in 1990 and 1991 in mesotrophic Lake Constance, Germany, on the basis of weekly to biweekly samplings at 7 depths between 1 and 50 or 120 m. Concentrations of DFAA ranged between <20 and 480 nM with highest values at the end of the phytoplankton spring bloom when daphnid grazing was very high. Concentrations of DCAA ranged between 610 and 3755 nM amino acid equivalents. In contrast to DFAA, however, highest concentrations of DCAA occurred in summer. The average C:N ratios of DFAA and DCAA ranged from 2.6 to 3.7 with most values between 2.8 and 3.3. DFAA incorporation (DFAA(inc)) fluctuated largely and accounted for <5 to ca. 100% of the C demand for bacterioplankton biomass production (BP). The mean ratio of DFAA(inc)/BP, however, ranged only between 0.2 and 0.4 indicating that other substrates were utilized as well. The turnover time of DFAA also fluctuated largely and ranged between 2.6 and >50 d with shortest times during the phytoplankton spring bloom. The interannual variability was most pronounced in summer. In 1991 the turnover of DFAA was significantly enhanced as compared to the previous summer as shown by higher rates of DFAA(inc) ratios of DFAA(inc)/BP, concentrations of DCAA and shorter turnover times of DFAA. The regression analysis of the seasonal dynamics of concentrations and utilization of DFAA and DCAA by bacterioplankton and phytoplankton and zooplankton parameters showed annual differences and between the periods in May/June (spring) and later in the season. Concentrations of DFAA and DCAA and DFAA(inc) were not significantly correlated to chlorophyll-a or primary production except in spring 1990. The former parameters, however, exhibited significant, though different, correlations to daphnids, ciliates and heterotrophic nanoflagellates in both years. Vertical dynamics of concentrations and bacterial utilization of dissolved amino acids often exhibited close correlations, in particular between concentrations of DCAA and bacterial abundance and production suggesting that DCAA, besides DFAA, were important substrates for bacterioplankton growth.																			0003-9136					DEC	1998	144	1					1	23																WOS:000077942100001

Abundance of all life history stages (zoeae, megalopae, juveniles and ovigerous females) was sampled approximately biweekly at each site from June 2001 to June 2002. The reproductive season, based on the presence of ovigerous females, is similar to 5 months (June to October) at both sites. Zoeae-I were collected from in June to July 2001 and in June 2002 at Terence Bay, and from June to August 2001 at Benacadic Pond. We did not collect later zoeal stages at either site. Megalopac were collected from September to October 2001 at Terence Bay, and from August to September 2001 at Benacadie Pond. juveniles 1-6 mm, carapace width (CW) were present throughout the summer at Terence Bay, and only in autumn at Benacadie. juveniles 6-12 and 12-27 mm CW were present throughout the summer and autumn at both sites. At Terence Bay, densities of 1-6 and 12-27 turn CW juveniles did not vary among intertidal zones. In contrast, the 6-12 mm CW size-class appeared to move higher in the intertidal through the season, possibly due to effects of predation.																			0025-3154	1469-7769				AUG	2005	85	4					847	855		10.1017/S002531540501180X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S002531540501180X													WOS:000231201300016

A systematic study considering the regional atmospheric circulation, the complex topography, and the reevaporation process is lacking. This paper compares and summarizes previous studies in the Extensive Hexi Region, to provide a regional picture of the characteristics of isotopic composition of precipitation and moisture sources. delta O-18 and delta D values exhibit significant seasonal variability, with higher values in summer and lower values in winter due to the seasonality of temperature and moisture sources. The temperature effect is more pronounced in the Extensive Hexi Region than in northwest China. The altitude effects are also evident with a gradient of -0.23 parts per thousand/100 m for delta O-18 and -1.67 parts per thousand/100 m for delta D. But, the d-excess increases gradually with altitude, and the higher d-excess values occur at mountain sampling sites which are attributed to the difference of the secondary evaporation between mountains and plain. Finally, the moisture source in the study area was investigated, and the results show relatively complex patterns: the westerly and polar air masses dominate in winter; however, there are inconsistent results in summer. Whether or not the westerly air mass is the dominant supply of moisture in summer is yet to be determined. Additionally, in the course of reviewing and integrating, some new research questions are identified for future work.																			1866-7511	1866-7538				JUL	2015	8	7					4365	4378		10.1007/s12517-014-1521-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12517-014-1521-9													WOS:000357101200007
J	van Vliet, LJP; Zebarth, BJ; Derksen, G				van Vliet, LJP; Zebarth, BJ; Derksen, G			Effect of fall-applied manure practices on runoff, sediment, and nutrient surface transport from silage corn in south coastal British Columbia	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Runoff from manured cropland during the wet fall and winter season, when 70% of the annual rainfall occurs, is a surface water quality concern in the Lower Fraser Valley of British Columbia. This study compares different fall-manure application strategies on runoff and contaminant transport from silage corn (Zea mays) land. The treatments were (i) a control, which did not receive manure in the fall; (ii) manure broadcast in the fall on corn stubble; and (iii) manure broadcast in the fall on corn stubble with an established relay crop. Runoff, solids, and nutrients loads from natural precipitation were measured on replicated experimental plots (0.0125 ha) from 1996 to 1998. Fall-applied manure on 3-5% sloping silage cornland without a relay crop resulted in a high risk to surface water quality, due to high suspended solid loads of between 7 and 14 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) and high nutrient transport with mean annual total Kjeldahl N (TKN) P, and K loads of 98, 21, and 63 kg ha(-1) respectively. Compared with no relay crop, intercropping silage corn with a relay crop of Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) reduced the mean annual runoff and suspended solid load by 53 and 74%, respectively, TKN load by 56%, P load by 42%, K load by 31%, and Cu load by 57%. Even though total nutrient loads were lower with the relay crop treatment, all fall manure treatments including the relay crop resulted in nutrient loads above guidelines for the first three runoff events immediately following application.																			0008-4271	1918-1841				NOV	2002	82	4					445	456		10.4141/S01-041	http://dx.doi.org/10.4141/S01-041													WOS:000180449700007

The mean abundance of the total zooplankton was higher in the first sampling period (2004-2005) and ranged between 8.81 and 47.74 ind. L-1, than the second period (2005-2006) when fluctuated between 1.91 and 43.09 ind. L-1 . The seasonal variation was strongly influenced by the presence of rotifers, which accounting on average for 68.4% in total. Among them Keratella cochlearis and the order Bdelloidea were numerically the most important, while Macrocyclops albidus prevailed among the copepods and Bosmina longirostris among the cladocerans. Dreissena polymorpha was the only mollusk found in the zooplankton community. Rotifers, copepods and cladocerans showed a seasonal succession with the former preceding in the abundance having their first maximum in spring, while copepods and cladocerans followed, having peaks of abundance in early summer and in autumn, respectively. No seasonal succession among the cladoceran species was observed. The intense water flow in the upstream part of the reservoir, as well as temperature, conductivity, DO, pH, phosphates and silicates, were significant parameters controlling abiotic and biotic elements of the ecosystem and consequently influencing the seasonal variation and the dynamics of the zooplankton community.					; Zacharias, Ierotheos/R-9672-2017; ZOTOS, ANASTASIOS/ABB-5449-2022	Zotos, Anastasios/0000-0002-6429-1842; Zacharias, Ierotheos/0000-0001-8410-6862; 													0006-3088	1336-9563				OCT	2008	63	5					699	710		10.2478/s11756-008-0129-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-008-0129-5													WOS:000259141400018

Field sampling and in situ nutrient addition bioassay were implemented to examine the nutrient limitation of phytoplankton growth and bloom initiation during autumn in Xiangxi Bay of the TGR. Result shows that P is the primary limiting nutrient for algal growth and bloom in Xiangxi Bay during autumn. The treatment involving the combination of N, P and Si had a significant (p < .05) additional effect on the growth of phytoplankton. The N, P, Si combined treatment increased growth by 10-50% relative to the N and P treatments from day 1 to day 4, respectively. Trace metal additions involving Fe, Zn, Mn, and Cu and/or in combination with N, P, and Si initially resulted in an extremely low growth rate which later increased significantly (p < .05) towards the end of the study. The present study provides an insight into the responses of different phytoplankton taxa in autumn under nutrient conditions in the tributary bay. The nutrient limitation study is recognized as the first step to mitigating the bloom while proposing an effective nutrient control strategy. The outcome of which can provide the basis for formulating sustainable watershed management. Multiple nutrients reductions with P as primary concern are required for a lasting management solution to the risk of bloom in the TGR. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Tian, C; Pei, HY; Hu, WR; Xie, J				Tian, Chang; Pei, Haiyan; Hu, Wenrong; Xie, Jun			Phytoplankton variation and its relationship with the environmental factors in Nansi Lake, China	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Nansi Lake is an important storage lake in the east route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project in China, about which there has been serious concern regarding the water quality. In this study, the phytoplankton taxonomic composition, abundance, temporal variations, spatial distribution, and diversity were studied based on a monthly sampling campaign from five sampling stations between January 2010 and December 2010. A total of 159 species (8 phyla, 79 genera), including 74 species of Chlorophyta, 36 species of Bacillariophyta, 19 species of Cyanophyta (including 2 water bloom causative species), 21 species of Euglenophyta, 3 species of Cryptophyta, 5 species of Xanthophyta, 2 species of Pyrrophyta, and 2 species of Chrysophyta, were identified. Average phytoplankton diversity index and evenness values were 4.33 and 0.81, respectively, revealing high biodiversity of phytoplankton community. The phytoplankton abundance averaged at 9.51 x 10(6) cells L-1 and was much higher than previous investigations carried out in 1983-1984. The dominant species were Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta in winter and spring, and Chlorophyta and Cyanophyta in summer and atutumn. There were 14 predominant species including Chlorella vulgaris, Cyclotella stelligera, Pseudanabaena limnetica, and Chroomonas acuta. Phytoplankton community structure and environmental variable changed substantially over the survey period. Redundancy Analysis was used to analyze the relationship between them. Temperature was considered to be the key factor driving the change in phytoplankton community composition in Nansi Lake during the 2010 study period.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				JAN	2013	185	1					295	310		10.1007/s10661-012-2554-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-012-2554-8								22327478					WOS:000312835300025

J	Zastepa, A; Comte, J; Crevecoeur, S				Zastepa, Arthur; Comte, Jerome; Crevecoeur, Sophie			Prevalence and ecological features of deep chlorophyll layers in Lake of the Woods, a complex hydrological system with strong trophic, physical, and chemical gradients	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We characterized deep chlorophyll layers (DCLs), previously unknown, in Lake of the Woods (Canada), a complex hydrological system with strong trophic, physical, and chemical gradients. Of 42 sites, five (12 %) contained at least one dense, thin metalimnetic peak - often more, overlapping or vertically stratified. In spring, highest biomass (>4 mg/L) was found at 3 m in Bigstone Bay, composed of a mixed phytoplankton community. Other, deeper, spring DCLs were dominated by the diatom Cyclotella (-1 mg/L, 21 m), dinoflagellate Gymnodinium (>1 mg/L, 17 m), cyanobacterium Dolichospermum (>3 mg/L, 10 m), or cyanobacterium Woronichinia (>1 mg/L,-8 m). In summer, the highest biomass of a DCL was in Yellow Girl Bay (>21 mg/L), over five times higher than spring and higher than large surface blooms from the shallow, eutrophic south (Sabaskong Bay-19 mg/L). Summer DCLs (-7 m) were not as deep as spring, owing to reduced light penetration (2.5-fold lower Zeu:Zmix). Most summer DCLs were domi-nated by Dolichospermum (max. >16 mg/L) but other species were also high (-1 mg/L biomass), including cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon, diatom Aulacoseira, and cryptophyte Cryptomonas. Euphotic zone in these embayments intersected with a nutrient-enriched (PO4, Fe, Mn, Si) hypoxic hypolimnion, condi-tions conducive to DCLs. Other drivers of composition and activity of DCLs remain to be elucidated. These high levels of DCL biomass, up to fivefold higher than near-surface, have routinely gone unre-ported. Their inclusion in establishing baselines and tracking change would inform lake management decisions and qualify expectations for ecosystem response.Crown Copyright (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of International Association for Great Lakes Research.

The epsomitic phototrophic microbial mat of Hot Lake, Washington: community structural responses to seasonal cycling	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Phototrophic microbial mats are compact ecosystems composed of highly interactive organisms in which energy and element cycling take place over millimeter-to-centimeter-scale distances. Although microbial mats are common in hypersaline environments, they have not been extensively characterized in systems dominated by divalent ions. Hot Lake is a meromictic, epsomitic lake that occupies a small, endorheic basin in north-central Washington. The lake harbors a benthic, phototrophic mat that assembles each spring, disassembles each fall, and is subject to greater than tenfold variation in salinity (primarily Mg2+ and SO42-) and irradiation over the annual cycle. We examined spatiotemporal variation in the mat community at five time points throughout the annual cycle with respect to prevailing physicochemical parameters by amplicon sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene coupled to near-full-length 16S RNA clone sequences. The composition of these microbial communities was relatively stable over the seasonal cycle and included dominant populations of Cyanobacteria, primarily a group IV cyanobacterium (Leptolyngbya), and Alphaproteobacteria (specifically, members of Rhodobacteraceae and Geminicoccus). Members of Gammaproteobacteria (e.g., Thioalkalivibrio and Halochromatium) and Deltaproteobacteria (e.g., Desulfofustis) that are likely to be involved in sulfur cycling peaked in summer and declined significantly by mid-fall, mirroring larger trends in mat community richness and evenness. Phylogenetic turnover analysis of abundant phylotypes employing environmental metadata suggests that seasonal shifts in light variability exert a dominant influence on the composition of Hot Lake microbial mat communities. The seasonal development and organization of these structured microbial mats provide opportunities for analysis of the temporal and physical dynamics that feed back to community function.					; Stegen, James/Q-3078-2016; Tringe, Susannah/T-9431-2019; Beyenal, Haluk/AAF-8637-2019; Lindemann, Steve/H-6979-2019; Renslow, Ryan/E-5851-2010	Malfatti, Stephanie/0000-0003-4225-9857; Stegen, James/0000-0001-9135-7424; Lindemann, Stephen/0000-0002-3788-5389; Moran, James/0000-0001-9081-9017; Tremblay, Julien/0000-0002-6085-3481; Tringe, Susannah/0000-0001-6479-8427														1664-302X				NOV 13	2013	4								1	10.3389/fmicb.2013.00323	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2013.00323								24312082					WOS:000331538100001

The lakes differ in their morphometric characteristics, thermal and oxygen regimes, and the extent of anthropogenic impact they experience. In the periods of summer and winter stratification, anaerobic water layers with higher phosphates, ammonium, and sulfide sulfur (hydrogen sulfide) are found to form in the bottom horizon of deep-water zones of the lakes. The highest concentrations of sulfide sulfur (150-210 mu g dm(-3)) were recorded in the shallow Beloe Lake during winter low-water period, while in summer, sulfide concentration did not differ from those obtained in other lakes (similar to 10 mu g dm(-3)). The abundance of sulfate-reducing bacteria in lake bottom sediments varied from 10 to 100000 cell cm(-3), and the rate of sulfate reduction process varied from 29 to 3746 mu g S dm(-3) day(-1). Seasonal variations were revealed in hydrogen sulfide distribution over the water column and in the rate of sulfate reduction process in the upper horizons of bottom sediments in the examined lakes.					; , Natalia/V-4986-2017; Vorobieva, Taisia/AAZ-2832-2020; Kokryatskaya, Natalia/V-4986-2017; Zabelina, Svetlana/A-8851-2014; Moreva, Olga/A-8591-2014; Savvichev, Alexander/B-9245-2018	Vorob'eva, Taisia/0000-0002-3410-0240; , Natalia/0000-0002-0619-7241; Zabelina, Svetlana/0000-0001-7160-0618; Moreva, Ol'ga/0000-0002-5114-8481; 													0097-8078	1608-344X				JAN	2012	39	1					105	117		10.1134/S009780781201006X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S009780781201006X													WOS:000301657500009

A total of 19 coprophilous and non-coprophilous fungal spore types were recovered from the dung samples. The diversity of the fungal spores in both seasons was almost similar, but the overall frequency of the coprophilous fungi in the winter samples was relatively lower compared to the summer samples. Clumping of the coprophilous fungi, Sporormiella, Saccobolus, and Cercophora, was observed regularly in the assemblage, indicating that the dung was the primary food source for these fungal spores. Non-coprophilous fungi such as Glomus, Pleospora, and Tetraploa are also consistently recovered in the assemblage. Multivariate principal component analysis (PCA) applied to the coprophilous and non-coprophilous fungal frequency data indicated significant variation in summer andwinter fungal types. Such differences in modern dung samples can serve as a baseline for the interpretation of coprolites of megafauna and provide insights into their ecology and extinction. Complementing paleoherbivory analysis, these baseline data can also be applied to the examination of sedimentary soil profiles to determine the presence and abundance of coprophilous fungi as a reflection of the former presence ofmegafauna in the region during the Quaternary. Such studies can also provide information on the relationship between the plants and animals in relation to the development of agro-pastoralism in the region. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Primary Production in a Subtropical Stratified Coastal Lagoon-Contribution of Anoxygenic Phototrophic Bacteria	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Anaerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria can be found in the suboxic waters of shallow stratified coastal systems, and may play important roles in the total primary production of subtropical stratified coastal lagoons. We investigated the spatiotemporal variability of light CO2 fixation and net oxygen production in the stratified Conceicao Lagoon (Brazil) in summer and fall of 2007, as well as the contribution of bacteriochlorophyll a (BChl a)-containing bacteria to photosynthetically driven electron transfer. Both chlorophyll a (Chl a) and BChl a varied in space, while only BChl a varied in time (three-fold increase from summer to fall). In summer, net oxygen production and light CO2 fixation were correlated, with both having higher rates with higher Chl a concentrations in the enclosed region of the lagoon. In fall, CO2 fixation was decoupled from oxygen production. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis revealed that bacterial communities of oxic site 12 and suboxic site 33 formed one cluster, different from other oxic samples within the lagoon. In addition, BChl a/Chl a ratios at these sites were high, 40% and 45%, respectively. Light acted as the main factor controlling the BChl a concentration and CO2 fixation rates. High turbidity within the enclosed area of the lagoon explained high BChl a and decoupling between CO2 fixation and oxygen production in oxygenated waters. Contribution of purple sulfur bacteria to total bacterial density in suboxic waters was 1.2%, and their biomass contributed to a much higher percentage (12.2%) due to their large biovolume. Our results indicate a significant contribution of anaerobic anoxygenic bacteria to the primary production of the "dead zone" of Conceicao Lagoon.

Effects of Climate Change on Lake Thermal Structure and Biotic Response in Northern Wilderness Lakes	WATER												Climate disrupts aquatic ecosystems directly through changes in temperature, wind, and precipitation, and indirectly through watershed effects. Climate-induced changes in northern lakes include longer ice-free season, stronger stratification, browning, shifts in algae, and more cyanobacterial blooms. We compared retrospective temperature-depth relationships modeled using MINLAKE2012 with biogeochemical changes recorded in sediment cores. Four lakes in Voyageurs National Park (VOYA) and four lakes in Isle Royale National Park (ISRO) were studied. Meteorological data from International Falls and Duluth, Minnesota, were used for VOYA and ISRO, respectively. Model output was processed to analyze epilimnetic and hypolimnetic water temperatures and thermal gradients between two periods (1962-1986, 1987-2011). Common trends were increased summer epilimnion temperatures and, for deep lakes, increased frequency and duration of thermoclines. Changes in diatom communities differed between shallow and deep lakes and the parks. Based on changes in benthic and tychoplanktonic communities, shallow lake diatoms respond to temperature, mixing events, pH, and habitat. Changes in deep lakes are evident in the deep chlorophyll layer community of Cyclotella and Discostella species, mirroring modeled changes in thermocline depth and stability, and in Asterionella and Fragilaria species, reflecting the indirect effects of in-lake and watershed nutrient cycling and spring mixing.					; Edlund, Mark/ADV-1967-2022; Fang, Xing/AAC-4760-2021	Key, Rebecca/0009-0004-5859-4873; Edlund, Mark/0000-0002-0227-1117; Fang, Xing/0000-0003-4188-9013; Engstrom, Daniel/0000-0002-8066-029X														2073-4441				SEP	2017	9	9							678	10.3390/w9090678	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w9090678													WOS:000411567200051

Detection of spatial and temporal hydro-meteorological trends in Lake Michigan, Lake Huron and Georgian Bay	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The Laurentian Great Lakes represent the largest freshwater basin on Earth, containing 21% of the world's surface fresh water by volume. Water level fluctuations are an on-going concern and have received considerable attention in the area. We present a trend analysis of meteorological (air temperature, cloud cover, and wind speed) and hydrological (precipitation, runoff, and evaporation) variables for Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, and Georgian Bay. Using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test, our analysis identified significant upward trends in daily minimum air temperature, whereas daily maximum air temperature demonstrated weakly decreasing trends in space and time. Evaporation was found to be increasing from late spring until early fall and this pattern may be explained by the shortening of the ice/snow cover period, which results in faster warming of lake surface due to the induced variations in albedo feedback. Time-series analysis of the over-lake precipitation revealed mostly non-significant statistical trends. Recent temperature increases may have led to elevated winter runoff in the Great Lakes region, given that precipitation falls mainly as rain instead of snow. We also provide clear evidence of reduced cloud cover and wind speed. Our study offers critical insights into the patterns of within- and among-year variability of hydro-meteorological variables useful in elucidating the mechanisms that modulate water levels in the Great Lakes.					; Arhonditsis, George/C-6980-2009	Javed, Aisha/0000-0002-8516-6370; Arhonditsis, George/0000-0001-5359-8737													1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN 2	2019	22	1					1	14		10.1080/14634988.2018.1500850	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634988.2018.1500850													WOS:000474012900001

Long-tailed Duck winter populations in the Baltic Sea have declined in recent decades. However, precise spatial data are lacking, especially from males. Thus, we aimed to identify the wintering grounds, timing of migration and stopover sites of males and females. We studied spatiotemporal distribution patterns of eight male and five female Long-tailed Ducks using implanted ARGOS satellite transmitters. Birds were tagged in the breeding season on Kolguev Island, Russia. After the breeding period, Long-tailed Ducks from Kolguev used three main post-breeding areas: most males undertook long distance eastward post-breeding migration to areas around the Yamal and Gydan peninsulas, while one male and four females moved short to the southeast coast of Kolguev, and one female moved to Mezhdusharsky Island in the Novaya Zemlya Archipelago. Autumn migration included stopover sites in the White Sea, Lake Ladoga, the Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Riga, and all birds except one spent the winter in the southern part of the Baltic Sea, from the Pomeranian coast and Hoburgs bank to the Gulf of Finland. Only one female stayed in the White Sea for the winter. All but one bird used the White Sea as a stopover site in May, suggesting that this area is of special importance.

J	Schanz, F				Schanz, F.			Oligotrophication of Lake Zurich as reflected in Secchi depth measurements	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Secchi depths recorded in Lake Zurich are determined mainly by concentrations of autochtonous material such as plankton and other material related to biomass production. The surface contrast transmittance factor has a negligible effect on a Secchi depth of up to 7 m and is of minor importance up to 13 m. Alterations in transparency values after 1970 as a result of the reduced nutrient input were most pronounced in the autumn-winter period (October 28 to February 19) as well as in the clear water phase (April 29 to July 29). After 1970, almost all buildings in the Lake Zurich drainage area were connected to a sewage treatment plant with a three stage purification. In the autumn-winter period, the Secchi depth is related to the development of Oscillatoria rubescens filaments and is not correlated with changes in trophic state. The restoration measures led to a statistically significant increase in the Secchi depth during the clear water phase, and additionally to a prolongation of the period with the highest tranparency values (May 20 to July 4). The Secchi technique is simple but seems to be valuable for recognizing long-term changes in the optical properties of a water body.																			0003-4088					MAR	1994	30	1					57	65		10.1051/limn/1994005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/1994005													WOS:000208074000005

Gert			Enhanced Arsenic Mobility in a Dystrophic Water Reservoir System After Acidification Recovery	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Arsenic concentrations in a drinking water reservoir system in the Eastern Ore mountains (Osterzgebirge, Germany) were observed over a 17-year period. The region experienced an environmental change during the past 20 years with decreasing acid, sulphur and nitrogen deposition and a recovering vitality of forested catchment sites. An increase of the arsenic content in the reservoir waters during that change was observed. This was caused by a diminished nitrate supply leading to lower redox potential in the sediments favouring sediment arsenic release. The recent annual cycle in the Altenberg reservoir water arsenic concentration was found to be independent from artificial aeration of the hypoxic hypolimnion during the summer stratification. However, we found a strong seasonal dependent change in water As concentration, with amaximum in autumn and a minimum in spring. The low productive system is driven by peat derived organic matter. For the recent arsenic catchment yield coherencies to dissolved organic carbon export and runoff intensity were found, indicating rising arsenic loads due to climate-related soil organic matter destabilization. Thus, in the reservoir system, both dry and wet climate conditions can increase the water As concentrations due to an internal arsenic release and a catchment arsenic import.

Lake Oigon is one lake with such a meromictic nature. However, a detailed study of the physico-chemical characteristics of Lake Oigon hasn't been conducted. In this study, we investigated the physico-chemical characteristics of the water of Lake Oigon from the surface to bottom at one-meter depth intervals and com-pared parameter trends in summer and winter. The pre -dominant hydrochemical type of lake water was Na-Cl-SO4. The salinity of the lake's water was mesosaline to hyper-saline. The concentrations of major ions (except sulphate) and microelements in summer were lower than that in winter. The suboxic layers (chemocline), and anoxic layer (monimolimnion) were often rich in nitrate, sulphide, ammonium, and phosphate despite the season. We hope that this study will show the characteristics of this meromictic lake and provide underlying information for future research on the chemical composition of Lake Oigon.																			1882-3416						2023	17	2					49	55		10.3178/hrl.17.49	http://dx.doi.org/10.3178/hrl.17.49													WOS:001011243500001

Several cases were observed in the artificial Danish freshwater Ringen Lake frequently used by the public for recreational purposes. The lake may serve as a model system when establishing a risk analysis for this zoonotic disease. In order to explain high risk periods we determined infection levels of intermediate host snails from early spring to late summer (March, June and August) and elucidated the effect of temperature and light on parasite shedding, behavior and life span. Results Field studies revealed no shedding snails in March and June but in late summer the prevalence ofTrichobilharzia szidatiinfection (in a sample of 226 pulmonateLymnaea stagnalissnails) reached 10%. When investigated under laboratory conditions the cercarial shedding rate (number of cercariae shed per snail per day) was positively correlated to temperature raising from a mean of 3000 (SD 4000) at 7 degrees C to a mean of 44,000 (SD 30,000) at 27 degrees C). The cercarial life span was inversely correlated to temperature but the parasites remained active for up to 60 h at 20 degrees C indicating accumulation of cercariae in the lake during summer periods. Cercariae exhibited positive phototaxy suggesting a higher pathogen concentration in surface water of the lake during daytime when the public visits the lake. Conclusion The only causative agent of cercarial dermatitis in Ringen Lake detected wasT. szidati.The infection risk associated with aquatic activities is low during spring and early summer (March-June). In late summer the risk of infection is high since the release, behavior and life span of the infective parasite larvae have optimal conditions.

Satellite remote sensing provides a useful tool to determine spatiotemporal distribution of water quality parameters. Previous DOC remote sensing studies in inland water suffered from either low spatial resolution or low temporal frequency. In this study, we evaluated the potential of jointly using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 with high spatial resolution to estimate DOC concentrations in Saginaw River plume regions of Lake Huron. Firstly. CDOM (colored dissolved organic matter) was estimated from images using the known models and then DOC can be derived in terms of the good correlations between DOC and CDOM. The results show that Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 had acceptable accuracy and good consistency in DOC estimation so that jointly using them can improve the observation frequency. In different seasons from 2013 to 2018, DOC was typically higher in spring and autumn but lower in summer. Monthly spatiotemporal variations of DOC in 2018 were also observed. The image-derived DOC spatiotemporal variations show that DOC was covaried with Saginaw River discharge (r =0.82) and also weakly and negatively correlated with water temperature (r =-0.6). This study demonstrated that using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 together can offer the potential applications for monitoring DOC and water quality dynamic in complex inland water. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Principal components analysis has been used as a means to summarize these relationships in two distinct periods, winter and summer, revealing the grouping of variables associated to abioseston or with biomass. Multiple regression analysis has been used to quantify these relationships. Total labile iron, calcium and chlorophyll appeared to be the best regressors of turbidity among our variables. The association between total labile iron and turbidity can be explained by the widespread adsorption of metals onto particles. Total labile manganese and phosphorus showed a similar behaviour, especially in winter. The presence of a relatively large proportion of detrital matter in low-biomass eutrophic reservoirs in winter has been revealed by the analysis of Chla:C and Chla:N ratios. The fact that low ratios were associated with high iron concentrations gives support to this view. Also the C:P and N:P particulate atomic ratios differed from winter to summer. All these ratios appear to be very sensitive to the presence of a variable detrital component and, therefore, their use as indicators of the physiological slate of phytoplanktonic populations is highly discouraged for these reservoirs.

Bacterial communities are important actors in alpine water body metabolism, and have shown both high seasonal and spatial variations. Seven springs from a high alpine valley (Matsch Valley, South Tyrol, Italy) were examined via a multidisciplinary approach using both hydrochemical and microbiological techniques. Amplified ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) and electric conductivity (EC) measurements, as well as elemental composition and water stable isotopic analyses, were performed. Our target was to elucidate whether and how bacterial community structure is influenced by water chemistry, and to determine the origin and extent of variation in space and time. There existed variations in both space and time for all variables measured. Diversity values more markedly differed at the beginning of summer and then at the end; the extent of variation in space was prevalent over the time scale. Bacterial community structural variation responded to hydrochemical parameter changes; moreover, the stability of the hydrochemical parameters played an important role in shaping distinctive bacterial communities.

The present observational study indicates that summer precipitation over eastern China likely underwent a change in the late 2000s, during which the main spatial pattern changed from negative-positive-negative to positive-negative in the meridional direction. This change in summer precipitation over eastern China may have been associated with circulation anomalies in the middle/upper troposphere. A strong trough over Lake Baikal created a southward flow of cold air during 2009-15, compared with 1999-2008, while the westward recession of the western Pacific subtropical high strengthened the moisture transport to the north, creating conditions that were conducive for more rainfall in the north during this period. The phase shift of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation in the late 2000s led to the Pacific-Japan-type teleconnection wave train shifting from negative to positive phases, resulting in varied summer precipitation over eastern China.																			2095-6037	2198-0934				APR	2017	31	2					397	408		10.1007/s13351-016-6021-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13351-016-6021-2													WOS:000400812000011

Unfiltered Hg-T concentrations ranged from 0.56 ng l(-1) at the Pere Marquette River to 182 ng l(-1) at the Fox River. Highest mean Hg-T concentrations were observed in the Fox R., Indiana Harbor Ship Canal, Grand R. and the Kalamazoo R. Mean particulate matter Hg-T content ranged from about 0.1 to 1.5 mu g g(-1), with highest levels from the industrialized basins of the Indiana Harbor and Fox River. Highest tributary loading rates (g day(-1)) were observed from the Fox, Grand, Kalamazoo and St. Joseph Rivers. Increased loading rates during spring melt and summer/fall storm events in these tributaries were generally associated with particulate loading from either sediment resuspension or erosional processes. In contrast, filtered Hg-T represented 80% of the Hg-T flux in the Manistique R., whose watershed is comprised almost entirely of wetlands and forest. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												that mixing regime plays a more important role in regulating phytoplankton composition than either nutrient status or light climate. Relationships between phytoplankton assemblages and lake trophic state, mixing regime and light climate were investigated in 40 North Island, New Zealand, lakes. We tested the hypothesis that mixing regime is more important than trophic state or light climate in determining the community composition of phytoplankton assemblages which were represented as presence/absence of cyanobacteria and diatom genera. Mixing regime, characterised as a function of lake size, more accurately predicted summer phytoplankton composition than indices related to trophic state or light regime. Analysis of similarities indicated distinct differences in phytoplankton assemblages between mixed lakes and those that intermittently or periodically stratify. In mixed lakes, a greater variety of cyanobacteria genera than diatom genera were recorded compared with lakes that stratify stably in summer. Conversely, relatively high numbers of diatom to cyanobacteria genera were found in lakes that stratify compared with mixed lakes. Lakes with different trophic states but similar mixing regimes shared very similar summer phytoplankton assemblages. None of the three variables tested was a good predictor of winter phytoplankton composition. Although phytoplankton biomass may be regulated to a large extent by nutrient status, this study shows that mixing regime plays a more important role in regulating phytoplankton composition than either nutrient status or light climate.

As a result of the accumulation of anthropogenic wastes and the alteration of hydroecological processes, these reservoirs may also become the emission hotspots of nitrous oxide (N2O). Hitherto, accurate global assessment of N2O emission suffers from the scarcity and low spatio-temporal resolution of field data, especially from small coastal reservoirs with high spatial heterogeneity and multiple water sources. In this study, we measured the surface water N2O concentrations and emissions at a high spatial resolution across three seasons in a subtropical coastal reservoir in southeastern China, which was hydrochemically highly heterogeneous because of the combined influence of river runoff, aquacultural discharge, industrial discharge and municipal sewage. Both N2O concentration and emission exhibited strong spatio-temporal variations, which were correlated with nitrogen loading from the river and wastewater discharge. The mean N2O concentration and emission were found to be significantly higher in the summer than in spring and autumn. The results of redundancy analysis showed that NH4+-N explained the greatest variance in N2O emission, which implied that nitrification was the main microbial pathway for N2O production in spite of the potentially increasing importance of denitrification of NO3 & minus;-N in the summer. The mean N2O emission across the whole reservoir was 107 mu g m & minus;2 h & minus;1, which was more than an order of magnitude higher than that from global lakes and reservoirs. Based on our results of Monte Carlo simulations, a minimum of 15 sampling points per km2 would be needed to produce representative and reliable N2O estimates in such a spatially heterogeneous aquatic system. Overall, coastal reservoirs could play an increasingly important role in future climate change via their N2O emission to the atmosphere as water demand and anthropogenic pressure continue to rise.

A new method for assessing the trophic state of large dams in Cyprus using satellite remotely sensed data	WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL												A timely low-cost method providing information on water quality and trophic state to various users of reservoir or dam water is a must. Conventional methods involved tedious and expensive in situ and laboratory studies. Satellite-borne sensors have the capability of providing repetitive, low-cost, multispectra, timely and reliable information over areas. This paper shows the development of a new method for assessing the trophic state in inland water bodies such as dams. The method is based on matching the atmospheric corrected reflectance values obtained from Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) image data with the defined spectral signature ranges obtained from ground spectro-radiometric measurements in order to assess the trophic state conditions. The proposed method has been applied to Landsat TM and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) satellite images of the Kourris and Asprokremmos Dams in Cyprus, acquired during the winter, spring, summer and autumn period. The reflectance values for the images acquired on 3 June 1985, 11 September 1998, 11 May 2000 and 31 January 2001 for the Asprokremmos Dam were found to be 4.5, 3.5, 3.7 and 11.2%, and those for the Kourris Dam were found to be 5, 3.5, 3.1 and 5.2%, respectively. Reflectance values between 3 and 7% correspond to a eutrophic state and values > 7% to a hypertrophic state. The results obtained from the proposed method were found to comply with those found using the trophic state index (TSI) approach. For example, the trophic state for the Landsat TM images of Asprokremmos Dam acquired on 11 May 2000 and 31 January 2001, was determined to be TSI=68 and 79, respectively, using the available secchi disc depths (SDDs) and the Carlson TSI. Such values correspond to eutrophic and hypetrophic trophic states that comply with the same outcomes found from the proposed method.

Seasonal Change in Trophic Niche of Adfluvial Arctic Grayling (Thymallus arcticus) and Coexisting Fishes in a High-Elevation Lake System	PLOS ONE												Introduction of non-native species is a leading threat to global aquatic biodiversity. Competition between native and non-native species is often influenced by changes in suitable habitat or food availability. We investigated diet breadth and degree of trophic niche overlap for a fish assemblage of native and non-native species inhabiting a shallow, high elevation lake system. This assemblage includes one of the last remaining post-glacial endemic populations of adfluvial Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) in the contiguous United States. We examined gut contents and stable isotope values of fish taxa in fall and spring to assess both short-(days) and long-term (few months) changes in trophic niches. We incorporate these short-term (gut contents) data into a secondary isotope analysis using a Bayesian statistical framework to estimate long-term trophic niche. Our data suggest that in this system, Arctic grayling share both a short-and long-term common food base with non-native trout of cutthroat x rainbow hybrid species (Oncorhynchus clarkia bouvieri x Oncorhynchus mykiss) and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). In addition, trophic niche overlap among Arctic grayling, hybrid trout, and brook trout appeared to be stronger during spring than fall. In contrast, the native species of Arctic grayling, burbot (Lota lota), and suckers (Catostomus spp.) largely consumed different prey items. Our results suggest strong seasonal differences in trophic niche overlap among Arctic grayling and non-native trout, with a potential for greatest competition for food during spring. We suggest that conservation of endemic Arctic grayling in high-elevation lakes will require recognition of the potential for coexisting non-native taxa to impede well-intentioned recovery efforts.																			1932-6203					MAY 20	2016	11	5							e0156187	10.1371/journal.pone.0156187	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0156187								27205901					WOS:000376291500048

Metal risk assessment is challenging due to variations in metal distribution, speciation, and bioavailability. Therefore, seasonal effects must be better understood, especially in boreal regions in which seasonal changes are large. We sampled 4 Finnish lakes and sediments affected by mining for metals and geochemical characteristics in autumn and late winter, to evaluate seasonal changes in metal behavior, the importance of seasonality in risk assessment, and the sensitivity and suitability of different risk assessment methods. We compared metal concentrations in sediment, overlying water, and porewater against environmental quality guidelines (EQGs). We also evaluated the toxicity of metal mixtures using simultaneously extracted metals and an acid volatile sulfides (SEM-AVS) approach together with water quality criteria (US Environmental Protection Agency equilibrium partitioning benchmarks). Finally, site-specific risks for 3 metals (Cu, Ni, Zn) were assessed using 2 biotic ligand models (BLMs). The metal concentrations in the impacted lakes were elevated. During winter stratification, the hypolimnetic O-2 saturation levels were low (<6%) and the pH was acidic (3.5-6.5); however, abundant O-2 (>89%) and neutral pH (6.1-7.5) were found after the autumnal water overturn. Guidelines were the most conservative benchmark for showing an increased risk of toxicity in the all of the lakes. The situation remained stable between seasons. On the other hand, SEM-AVS, equilibrium partition sediment benchmarks (ESBs), and BLMs provided a clearer distinction between lakes and revealed a seasonal variation in risk among some of the lakes, which evidenced a higher risk during late winter. If a sediment risk assessment is based on the situation in the autumn, the overall risk may be underestimated. It is advisable to carry out sampling and risk assessment during periods in which metals are assumed to be the most environmentally harmful.

Cercoapgis pengoi is most abundant in late summer and fall. Therefore, we hypothesized that abundance of small zooplankton (bosminids and cyclopoids) species would decrease at that time. To determine if the establishment of C. pengoi was followed by changes in the zooplankton community, seasonal patterns in nearshore zooplankton collected from May to October 1995-2000 were examined. Early summer density of small zooplankton was similar in all years while late summer and fall densities were significantly lower in 1998-2000 than in 1995-1997. The declines of small zooplankton coincided seasonally with the peak in C. pengoi density. Other possible causes for the observed changes in small zooplankton are less likely. High levels of fish predation should have resulted in smaller zooplankton in 1998-2000 than in 1995-1997 and larger declines in Daphnia than other groups. This was not observed. There was no significant decline in chlorophyll-a concentrations or changes in temperature between 1995-1997 and 1998-2000. There re, the declines in density of small zooplankton were most likely the result of C. pengoi predation. The effect of C. pengoi establishment on alewives is increased competition for zooplankton prey but C. pengoi has replaced a portion of the zooplankton biomass and adult alewife diet formerly dominated by Diacyclops thomasi and Bosmina longirostris.

Study of seasonal variations and risk assessment of selected metals in sediments from Mangla Lake, Pakistan	JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION												Composite sediment samples were collected from Mangla Lake, Pakistan, in order to determine the seasonal variations in the concentrations of selected metals (Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Pb and Zn) and to evaluate the associated risk assessment. Average metal levels in acid-extract of the sediments revealed similar decreasing trend during summer and winter: Ca > Fe > Mg > Mn > Zn > Cr > Pb > Cu > Cd. Generally, elevated metal levels were observed during winter. Metal pollution index was evaluated using enrichment factor (EF) and geoaccumulation index (I-geo), which showed significantly higher contamination by Cd and Pb. Association with adverse biological effects to aquatic biota was also assessed using the classification of the sediments and sediment quality guidelines. Pb exceeded the threshold effect level (TEL) and Cd even exceeded the probable effect levels (PEL) during the both seasons, whereas, Cu and Cr exceeded the TEL levels during winter and Zn exceeded the limits during summer. However, potential acute toxicity and PELq assessment for the sediments demonstrated that the risk for the benthic biota was insignificant. Multivariate principal component analysis and cluster analysis evidenced considerable anthropogenic contribution of the metals in sediments during both seasons. The sediments were also extracted with a weak electrolyte solution (0.1 M Ca(NO3)(2)) to predict the bioavailability of the metals which revealed that Cd and Pb were the most bioavailable, while Fe and Mn were the least bioavailable.

Patterns of CO2 and radiocarbon across high northern latitudes during International Polar Year 2008	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												High-resolution in situ CO2 measurements were conducted aboard the NASA DC-8 aircraft during the ARCTAS/POLARCAT field campaign, a component of the wider 2007-2008 International Polar Year activities. Data were recorded during large-scale surveys spanning the North American sub-Arctic to the North Pole from 0.04 to 12 km altitude in spring and summer of 2008. Influences on the observed CO2 concentrations were investigated using coincident CO, black carbon, CH3CN, HCN, O-3, C2Cl4, and Delta(CO2)-C-14 data, and the FLEXPART model. In spring, the CO2 spatial distribution from 55 degrees N to 90 degrees N was largely determined by the long-range transport of air masses laden with Asian anthropogenic pollution intermingled with Eurasian fire emissions evidenced by the greater variability in the mid-to-upper troposphere. At the receptor site, the enhancement ratios of CO2 to CO in pollution plumes ranged from 27 to 80 ppmv ppmv(-1) with the highest anthropogenic content registered in plumes sampled poleward of 80 degrees N. In summer, the CO2 signal largely reflected emissions from lightning-ignited wildfires within the boreal forests of northern Saskatchewan juxtaposed with uptake by the terrestrial biosphere. Measurements within fresh fire plumes yielded CO2 to CO emission ratios of 4 to 16 ppmv ppmv(-1) and a mean CO2 emission factor of 1698 +/- 280 g kg(-1) dry matter. From the C-14 in CO2 content of 48 whole air samples, mean spring (46.6 +/- 4.4%) and summer (51.5 +/- 5%) Delta(CO2)-C-14 values indicate a 5% seasonal difference. Although the northern midlatitudes were identified as the emissions source regions for the majority of the spring samples, depleted Delta(CO2)-C-14 values were observed in <1% of the data set. Rather, ARCTAS Delta(CO2)-C-14 observations (54%) revealed predominately a pattern of positive disequilibrium (1-7%) with respect to background regardless of season owing to both heterotrophic respiration and fire-induced combustion of biomass. Anomalously enriched Delta(CO2)-C-14 values (101-262%) measured in emissions from Lake Athabasca and Eurasian fires speak to biomass burning as an increasingly important contributor to the mass excess in Delta(CO2)-C-14 observations in a warming Arctic, representing an additional source of uncertainty in the quantification of fossil fuel CO2.

In this context, the importance of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) for both algae and bacteria was investigated in 1998 and 1999 in terms of stocks and fluxes. Within the mixed layer, although phosphate decreased until exhaustion from winter to spring, DOP remained high and phosphate monoesters made up between I I to 65% of this pool. Total alkaline phosphatase activity (APA, V(max)) rose gradually from winter (2-8 nM h(-1)) to late spring (100-400 nM h-1), which was mainly due to an increase in specific phytoplankton (from 0.02 to 3.0 nmol mu gC(-1) h(-1)) and bacterial APA (from 0.04 to 4.0 nmol mu gC(-1) h(-1)), a strategy to compensate for the lack of phosphate. At each season, both communities had equal competitive abilities to exploit DOP but, taking into account biomass, the phytoplankton community activity always dominated (57-63% of total APA) that of bacterial community (9-11%). The dissolved APA represented a significant contribution. In situ regulation of phytoplanktonic APA by phosphate (induction or inversely repression of enzyme synthesis) was confirmed by simultaneously conducted phosphate-enrichment bioassays. Such changes recorded at a time scale of a few days could partly explain the seasonal response of phytoplankton communities to phosphate depletion. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

This raises concerns that species-specific responses to warming may de-synchronize co-evolved consumer-resource phenologies, resulting in trophic mismatch and altered ecosystem dynamics. We explored the effects of warming on the synchrony of two events: the onset of the phytoplankton spring bloom and the spring/summer maximum of the grazer Daphnia. Simulation of 16 lake types over 31 years at 1907 North African and European locations under 5 climate scenarios revealed that the current median phenological delay between the two events varies greatly (20-190 days) across lake types and geographic locations. Warming moves both events forward in time and can lengthen or shorten the delay between them by up to +/- 60 days. Our simulations suggest large geographic and lake-specific variations in phenological synchrony, provide quantitative predictions of its dependence on physical lake properties and geographic location and highlight research needs concerning its ecological consequences.					; Diehl, Sebastian/B-2653-2013; Jöhnk, Klaus/B-3382-2008; Straile, Dietmar/A-4065-2008; Johnk, Klaus/B-3382-2008	Diehl, Sebastian/0000-0002-3860-5051; Straile, Dietmar/0000-0002-7441-8552; gronchi, enzo/0000-0002-9901-4829; Johnk, Klaus/0000-0002-5972-4201													1461-023X	1461-0248				MAY	2023	26	5					717	728		10.1111/ele.14190	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.14190		MAR 2023						36870064					WOS:000943587500001

Sample fields were chosen from seven representative soil units under different crop rotations. The distribution of mineral N (NO3-N + NH4-N) throughout the soil profile and the concentration of NO3-N in the ground water and drainage water were measured and allocated to 6-month winter or spring periods. For all fields N was leached to the deeper soil layers and to the saturated zones by both excess winter rainfall and spring irrigation of different crops. The amount of nitrogen leached depended on the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied; the depth of leaching varied with the physical properties of the soils. Losses in individual fields accounted for the equivalent of 17.6-80.8% of the nitrogen applied to maize and 70.5 94.1% of that applied to wheat. For the whole region estimated minimum N losses ranged from 175,912 to 783,564 kg for the 6-month period. Nitrate concentrations in the ground and surface waters were often more than the EC target level of 25 mg/l.																			0266-0032					JUN	1993	9	2					76	84		10.1111/j.1475-2743.1993.tb00933.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-2743.1993.tb00933.x													WOS:A1993LC91200006

Oxygen depletion in subarctic peatland thaw lakes	ARCTIC SCIENCE												Permafrost thawing and erosion results in the enrichment of northern lakes by soil organic matter. These allochthonous inputs favour bacterial decomposition and may cause the draw-down of dissolved oxygen to anoxic conditions that promote methanogenesis. Our objective in the present study was to determine the seasonal variations in dissolved oxygen in a set of permafrost peatland lakes in subarctic Quebec, Canada, and to relate these changes to metabolic rates, ice cover, and mixing. The lakes had high dissolved organic carbon concentrations, and their surface waters in summer had greenhouse gas concentrations that were up to one (CO2) to three (CH4) orders of magnitude above air-equilibrium values, indicating their strongly heterotrophic character. Consistent with these observations, the peatland lakes had elevated rates of bacterial production and oxygen consumption. Continuous measurements of oxygen by in situ sensors and of ice cover by automated field cameras showed that the lakes became fully anoxic shortly after freeze-up. The waters were partially re-oxygenated by mixing events in spring and fall, but in one lake, the bottom waters remained anoxic throughout the year. These observations provide a foundation for subsequent bio-geochemical and modelling studies of peatland thaw lakes as an abundant class of Arctic freshwater ecosystems.					; Matveev, Alex/H-7380-2017; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019; Maps, Frederic/L-4546-2013	Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; Matveev, Alex/0000-0003-4103-9131; Maps, Frederic/0000-0001-7115-2464														2368-7460				JUN	2017	3	2			SI		406	428		10.1139/as-2016-0048	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/as-2016-0048													WOS:000416398800018
J	Van der Molen, DT; Portielje, R				Van der Molen, DT; Portielje, R			Multi-lake studies in The Netherlands: trends in eutrophication	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Conference on Trophic Interactions in Shallow Freshwater and Brackish Waterbodies	AUG 03-08, 1998	BLOSSIN, GERMANY	Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisher, Tech Univ Cottbus				The relation between (inter)national programs aiming at nutrient load reduction and changes in eutrophication has been studied for 231 Dutch lakes over the period 1980-1996. Trends in total-phosphorus (P) and total-nitrogen (N) were negative, as determined by analysis of both individual lakes and the complete data set. The relative trends in the nutrient concentrations as well as in the N/P ratio correspond with the significantly reduced P emission and the limited reduction of N emission in The Netherlands since the beginning of the 1980s. Negative trends in chlorophyll-a and positive trends in Secchi-disc transparency may be partly explained by reduced nutrient concentrations. Perspectives for the nearby future are discussed. Lake characteristics had only a minor impact on the trends. The improvement of the water quality was found for all subsets of average depth, surface area, hydraulic retention time and soil type. Furthermore, the effect of restoration measures and meteorological conditions on the trends were studied. Biomanipulation resulted in an additional improvement of several water quality variables compared to lakes that were only subject to (inter)national programs on nutrient load reduction. Specific measures resulting in additional P load reduction resulted only in lowered P concentrations. Severe winters resulted in lower chlorophyll-a concentrations in the following summer and dry conditions in spring were favourable for all eutrophication variables in the following summer.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1999	408						359	365		10.1023/A:1017086830568	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017086830568													WOS:000084892400040

State of the art remote controlled cabled underwater observatory technology was used for daily vertical profiles of temperature, salinity, and turbidity together with a stereo-optical assessment of the macrobiotic community, including fish. The results reveal a distinct seasonal cycle in total species abundances, with a significantly higher total abundance and species richness during the polar winter when no light is available underwater compared to the summer months when 24 h light is available. During the winter months, a temporally highly segmented community was observed with respect to species occurrence, with single species dominating the winter community for restricted times. In contrast, the summer community showed an overall lower total abundance as well as a significantly lower number of species. The study clearly demonstrates the high potential of cable connected remote controlled digital sampling devices, especially in remote areas, such as polar fjord systems, with harsh environmental conditions and limited accessibility. A smart combination of such new digital "sampling" methods with classic sampling procedures can provide a possibility to significantly extend the sampling time and frequency, especially in remote and difficult to ac-cess areas. This can help to provide a sufficient data density and therefore statistical power for a sound scientific analysis without increasing the invasive sampling pressure in ecologically sensitive environments.					; Fischer, Philipp/R-9804-2016; Fischer, Philipp/V-7948-2019	Brand, Markus/0000-0003-4768-1889; Fischer, Philipp/0000-0002-3357-5420; 													1812-0784					APR 4	2017	13	2					259	272		10.5194/os-13-259-2017	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/os-13-259-2017													WOS:000398070500001

A close relationship was found between annual inorganic nitrogen loss and the fractional cover bare rock explaining 74% of the variation. It was not possible to distinguish between the N leaching from the peat and heather dominated catchments in this investigation. Nitrate loss was negatively correlated to the C/N ratio of the soil organic horizon. Lowest soil C/N ratios of the soil organic surface horizon occurred in catchments receiving the highest amounts of N deposition. Our data for Norwegian moorland are in agreement with previous investigations relating soil C/N ratio and N leaching in forest soils. Runoff from the catchments showed a seasonal pattern in NO3- concentrations. The low values during the summer are presumably due to increased biological activity (plant uptake and immobilization by soil microbes). The winter and spring NO3- concentrations in 2001 in all catchments were much higher than in 2000, perhaps due to soil freezing.

J	MARTIN, DB; NOVOTNY, JF				MARTIN, DB; NOVOTNY, JF			ZOOPLANKTON STANDING CROPS IN DISCHARGE OF LAKE FRANCIS CASE, 1966-1972	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												An automatic plankton sampler was used from 1966-1972 to monitor zooplankton standing crops in the discharge of Lake Francis Case, a Missouri River reservoir [South Dakota USA]. Cyclops, the most abundant taxon, had a strongly bimodal annual distribution, with maxima in late spring and early winter. Diaptomus, the 2nd most abundant taxon, exhibited a unimodal annual distribution, with the maximum extending from early spring to midsummer. The annual cycle of Daphnia, the only other frequently encountered taxon, was weakly bimodal, with the primary maximum in late spring and a secondary maximum in early winter. Cyclops standing crops decreased during the 7 yr study, while Diaptomus standing crops increased slightly. Daphnia standing crops fluctuated at relatively low levels from year to year, and no long-term trend was discernible. Year-to-year fluctuations in the standing crop of each major taxon were not correlated with young-of-the-year fish abundance or average hydrographic conditions. The long-term changes in the zooplankton standing crops in Lake Francis Case may be related to events in the history of Lake Oahe, a newer and much larger reservoir located about 140 km upstream on the Missouri River.																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1977	98	2					296	307		10.2307/2424981	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2424981													WOS:A1977EE92700004

Temporal controls	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Seasonal and interannual controls of benthic sulfate reduction (SR) were examined at 3 sites (upper [UB], mid- [MB] and lower [LB] bay) along the Chesapeake Bay central channel, from early spring through fall, for 6 yr (1989 to 1994). The combined influences of temperature, sulfate, organic loading and bioturbation affected seasonal SR rates differently in the 3 regions. Consistently low SR rates at UB resulted from low overlying-water sulfate concentrations and the dominance of refractory organic terrestrial material. Combined seasonal variation in temperature and sulfate accounted for 50% of the annual variability in 0 to 2 cm depth interval SR rates, while sediment organic content had no significant seasonal influence. In contrast, MB and LB sites had high rates of SR fostered by high levels of overlying water SO42- and organic input dominated by labile phytoplankton detritus. New organic loading (measured as chl a) stimulated 0 to 2 cm SR during spring at both sites. Combined organic quantity (as particulate C and/or N) and temperature accounted for >75% of the variability in 0 to 2 cm SR at MB during spring and fall. Molecular diffusion supplied 25 to 45% of the SO42- needed to fuel 0 to 12 cm depth interval SR at MB, with the balance presumably supplied by S-recycling. Interannual differences in summertime SR rates were linked to the extent of freshwater flow during spring, with high-flow years associated with high SR rates at UB and MB, and low rates at LB. The negative trend between benthic SR and river flow at LB may result from the up-estuary transport of senescing organic matter in bottom water, which increases in the lower reach of the estuary with increasing freshwater inflow.					; Boynton, Walter/C-3035-2012	Boynton, Walter/0000-0002-6516-8352; 													0171-8630	1616-1599					2003	260						55	70		10.3354/meps260055	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps260055													WOS:000186420500005
J	Zeigler, JM; Whitledge, GW				Zeigler, John M.; Whitledge, Gregory W.			Assessment of otolith chemistry for identifying source environment of fishes in the lower Illinois River, Illinois	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Knowledge of habitats used by fish throughout their life history is important for the management and conservation of riverine fish populations and habitats. Naturally occurring chemical markers in otoliths have recently been used to determine natal origins and environmental history of fishes in a variety of marine and freshwater environments. However, to our knowledge, no studies have examined the applicability of this technique in large floodplain rivers in the USA. We evaluated otolith microchemistry and stable isotopic composition as tools for determining origins of fishes in the lower Illinois River, its tributaries, and floodplain lakes. Fishes were collected from eight sites during summer 2006 and two additional sites in spring 2007. Water samples were obtained from these 10 sites plus one additional tributary during summer and fall 2006 and spring 2007. Otolith and water samples were analyzed for delta O-18 and a suite of trace elements; otoliths were also analyzed for delta C-13. Tributaries, floodplain lakes, and the Illinois River possessed distinct isotopic and elemental signatures, principally driven by differences in delta O-18 and delta C-13 among floodplain lakes, the Illinois River, and tributary streams. Otoliths reflected the differences in water chemistry among habitats. Relationships between water and otolith delta O-18 and Sr:Ca were not significantly different among species, but some differences in relationships between water and otolith Ba:Ca among species were detected. Linear discriminant function analysis with a leave-one-out jackknife procedure on otolith delta O-18 and delta C-13 indicated that fish may be classified back to environment (Illinois River, tributary, or floodplain lake) of capture with 80-98% accuracy. Otolith microchemistry and stable isotope analyses provide a potentially effective means for determining recruitment sources and environmental history of fishes in the Illinois River. The ability to reconstruct environmental history of individual fish using naturally occurring isotopic markers in otoliths may also facilitate efforts to quantify nutrient and energy subsidies to the Illinois River provided by fishes that emigrate from floodplain lakes or tributaries.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2010	638	1					109	119		10.1007/s10750-009-0033-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-009-0033-1													WOS:000273244000009

Seasonal and spatial variations in characteristics of Lake Biwa dissolved organic matter: sorption of pyrene and its derivatives and fluorescence properties	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The objectives of this research were to investigate seasonal and spatial variations in ( 1) sorption of pyrene and its derivatives onto dissolved organic matter (DOM) and ( 2) fluorescence properties of DOM in Lake Biwa, Japan. In the case of pyrene, sorption coefficient (K-doc) of Lake Biwa DOM seasonally changed from 1,200 to 3,800 L/kgC. Vertical distribution of K-doc was affected by thermocline formation in summer, while it was uniformly distributed as a result of vertical mixing in winter. Functional groups affected sorption of pyrene onto Lake Biwa DOM in different manner from that onto Suwannee River fulvic acid. Three-dimensional excitation emission matrices (3D-EEMs) fluorescence spectroscopy was applied to characterize Lake Biwa DOMs and indicated the existence of at least two fluorophores. The two major peaks at Ex230/Em300 and Ex230/Em425 originated from protein-like and fulvic/humic-like substances, respectively. The peak at Ex230/Em300 showed the maximum fluorescence intensity at a depth of 5m and could be affected by stratification of the water column in summer. On the other hand, the peak at Ex230/Em425 showed similar profiles both in summer and in winter. These results demonstrably showed that sorption of micropollutants and fluorescence properties of Lake Biwa DOMs were seasonally and spatially varied.

Isotopic records are consistent with the following scenario: Before 9800 yr B.P. the two lakes were connected. Increasing evaporation through the jack/red pine period (9800-7700 yr B.P.) led to lower lake levels, leaving small separated basins. The prairie period (7700-4000 yr B.P.) reflects high aridity, and lake levels reached low stands shortly before 6500 yr B.P. Low lake levels are associated with groundwater discharge between 6500 and 6000 yr B.P. The hardwood period (4000-3200 yr B.P.) corresponds to long cold winters and warm to cool summers with lower evaporation rates and slower sedimentation. During the white pine period (<3200 yr B.P.) evaporation increased and/or precipitation shifted to the summer months. These changes can be related to shifting atmospheric circulation patterns. Zonal flow was probably dominant during the early Holocene until the end of the prairie period (c. 4000 yr B.P.). During the hardwood period a combination of zonal and meridional flow patterns caused long and cold winters and wetter summers. During the white pine period winters were shorter and the meridional flow pattern more significant. Today meridional flow dominates the circulation pattern.

Lakeward movement occurred from May through November, intensifying over a 6- to 8-wk period during spring. Parr remained in the lakes where they either matured (usually males) or smoltified (predominantly females) before returning to the streams. Mature parr emigrated from the lakes during autumn whereas smolts entered the streams during spring. Lakes provided conditions for increased parr growth and survival to the smolt stage relative to the riverine environment, and appeared to represent important overwinterig habitat. Smolt production occurred almost entirely within the lakes. Parr movement into lakes could not be explained by physical environmental factors. Lakeward migrations appeared to have an adaptive basis and can be explained as an evolutionarily stable reproductive tactic.

Convergence of trophic state and the lower food web in Lakes Huron, Michigan and Superior	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Signs of increasing oligotrophication have been apparent in the open waters of both Lake Huron and Lake Michigan in recent years. Spring total phosphorus (TP) and the relative percentage of particulate phosphorus have declined in both lakes; spring TP concentrations in Lake Huron are now slightly lower than those in Lake Superior, while those in Lake Michigan are higher by only about 1 mu g P/L. Furthermore, spring soluble silica concentrations have increased significantly in both lakes, consistent with decreases in productivity. Transparencies in Lakes Huron and Michigan have increased, and in most regions are currently roughly equivalent to those seen in Lake Superior. Seasonality of chlorophyll, as estimated by SeaWiFS satellite imagery, has been dramatically reduced in Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, with the spring bloom largely absent from both lakes and instead a seasonal maximum occurring in autumn, as is the case in Lake Superior. As of 2006, the loss of cladocerans and the increased importance of calanoids, in particular Limnocalanus, have resulted in crustacean zooplankton communities in Lake Huron and Lake Michigan closely resembling that in Lake Superior in size and structure. Decreases in Diporeia in offshore waters have resulted in abundances of non-dreissenid benthos communities in these lakes that approach those of Lake Superior. These changes have resulted in a distinct convergence of the trophic state and lower food web in the three lakes, with Lake Huron more oligotrophic than Lake Superior by some measures.

Five random forest (RF) models are developed to estimate these parameters in Xin'anjiang Reservoir, which is a clear drinking water resource in Zhejiang, China. Then, the spatio-temporal distributions of the parameters over 7 years (2013-2019) are mapped using GaoFen-1 (GF-1) images and the relationships with driving factors are analyzed. Our study demonstrates that the parameters' distributions exhibited a significant spatio-temporal difference in Xin'anjiang Reservoir. Spatially, relatively high C-TP, C-COD, C-Chla, and C(TSM)but low SDD appear in riverine areas, showing strong evidence of impact from the incoming rivers. Temporally, C(Chla)and C(TSM)reached high values in summer and winter, whereas SDD and C(TP)were higher in the summer and autumn, respectively. In contrast, no significant seasonal variations of C(COD)could be observed. This may be why C(COD)is not sensitive to hydrological or meteorological factors. However, precipitation had a significant impact on C-Chla, C-TP, SDD, and C(TSM)in riverine areas, though these parameters were less sensitive to meteorological factors. Moreover, the geomorphology of the reservoir and anthropogenic interference (e.g., tourism activities) also have a significant impact on the water quality parameters. This study demonstrates that coupling long-term GF-1 images and RF models could provide strong evidence and new insights to understand long-term dynamics in water quality and therefore support the development of corresponding management strategies for freshwater reservoirs.

However, the hydrological regimes in these systems are often similar to those of large reservoirs where fluctuating water levels during spawning have been shown to affect largemouth bass population dynamics. Most backwater lakes of the Illinois River have soft, silty substrates. These substrates are not conducive to nest building, so spawning centrarchids may use annual spring hoods to access inundated terrestrial vegetation and previously dry, compacted substrates on the floodplain. We used electrofishing catch data from La Grange Reach of the Illinois River (1990-1995) to assess how spring and early-summer river levels influence the cohort strength of largemouth bass. Strong cohorts were produced during years with high spring floods (1990, 1993, and 1995) when largemouth bass could access the floodplain for spawning and nursery habitat. In both 1990 and 1993, fish had access to the floodplain for extended periods during spring and summer, which resulted in exceptionally strong cohorts. These cohorts probably benefitted from abundant forage and cover on the floodplain, which bolstered survival rates. Weak cohorts were produced in 1992 and 1994 when river levels were low and fluctuating during spawning and in 1991 when river levels declined dramatically during spawning. Length distributions of other centrarchids mirrored those of large-mouth bass, indicating that river levels probably affected other nest-building species in La Grange Reach.

Water quality response to the Angora Fire, Lake Tahoe, California	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												The Angora Fire (summer of 2007) was the largest and most severe wildfire in recent history within the Lake Tahoe basin of the Sierra Nevada. To determine the watershed response and to assess the potential for downstream impacts of nutrient and sediment delivery to Lake Tahoe, we monitored the post-fire hydrology and stream water chemistry for 2 years at four locations along the length of Angora Creek, a perennial stream draining the burned watershed. When compared with unburned streams, the hydrology of Angora Creek indicated an earlier and faster melting of the spring snowpack. Peak stream water concentrations of total N (TN) and ammonium occurred within the burned area, whereas peak concentrations of nitrate (NO3 (-)), total P, soluble reactive P, total suspended solids, turbidity, electrical conductivity (EC), and dissolved organic C occurred below the burned area. In comparison to pre-fire data, TN, NO3 (-), TP, total dissolved P, EC, and turbidity increased following the fire, particularly in the wetter second year. Yields for subwatershed areas suggest that the burned urban subwatershed was the largest source of nutrients and sediments, whereas the wet meadow subwatershed downstream of the burned area retained materials. Erosion control efforts, below-average annual precipitation and the timing of its arrival (absence of summer and fall rainstorms), and the existence of a wet meadow below the burned watershed likely reduced the negative impacts that would have been expected from such a severe wildfire.					; Heyvaert, Alan/HZJ-5556-2023	Dahlgren, Randy/0000-0002-8961-875X; 													0168-2563	1573-515X				NOV	2012	111	1-3					361	376		10.1007/s10533-011-9657-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-011-9657-0													WOS:000314063200023

Of this feedback, methane (CH4) emission from natural wetlands is critically important due to its high warming potential. The freeze-thaw transition has been confirmed to play an important role in annual CH4 budget, yet the magnitude of this effect is uncertain. An intensive field campaign was carried out in the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China to estimate the CH4 emission in the spring freeze-thaw transition period. The observation concluded that a large CH4 source was caused by spring thaw; the maximum hourly emission rate was 48.6 g C m(-2) h(-1), more than three orders of the regularly observed CH4 emission rate in the growing season. In some sporadically observed 'hot spots', the spring thawing effect contributed to a large CH4 source of 31.3 +/- 10.1 g C m(-2), which is approximately 80% of the previously calculated annual CH4 emission in the same study area. If our results are typical for natural wetlands in the Northern Hemisphere permafrost region, we estimate a global CH4 source strength of 0.5-1.0 Tg C (1 Tg = 10(12) g) caused by spring thaw in the Northern Hemisphere permafrost region in the year 2011. Combining with available satellite and flask data, a regional extrapolation reaches a temporal pattern of CH4 emission during 2003-2009 which is consistent with recently observed changes in atmospheric CH4 concentration in the high latitudes. This suggests that the CH4 emission upon spring thaw in the high latitudes might be enhanced by the projected climate warming. These findings indicate that the spring thawing effect is an important mechanism in the permafrost carbon-climate feedback and needs to be incorporated in Earth system models.

Because of the high turbidity and high nutrient concentrations primary production by phytoplankton is light-limited. In the inner and central parts of the estuary maximum rates of primary production were therefore measured during the summer, whereas in the more marine part spring and autumn bloom were observed. Organic loading is high, causing near anaerobic conditions upstream in the river Schelde. Because of this there were no important phytoplankton grazers in this part of the estuary and hence the grazing pressure on phytoplankton was minimal. As this reduced losses, biomass is maximal in the river Schelde, despite the very low growth rates. On a number of occasions, primary production by benthic micro-algae on intertidal flats was studied. Comparison of their rates of primary production to phytoplankton production in the same period led to the conclusion that the contribution to total primary production by benthic algae was small. The main reason for this is that the photosynthetic activity declines rapidly after the flats emerged from the water. It is argued that CO2-limitation could only be partially responsible for the noticed decrease in activity.

The rough set theory (RST) was used to describe the spatiotemporal relations of eutrophication in Da'ning River without any of other prior knowledge. Rules of relations in time and space affecting eutrophication in the Da'ning River backwater area were extracted by taking representation of relations in time and space among eutrophication at a long river section of Da'ning River backwater area, by taking nine sets of encrypted monitoring data in 2003 as example, and by making season, area and eutrophication level as the decision attributes, respectively, to represent specific features of the eutrophication phenomenon in the Da'ning River backwater area from the points of view of time, space, and level by analysis of spatiotemporal relationship rules. This study result shows that the temporal and spatial differences between eutrophication phenomena in the long river section of the Da'ning River backwater area are significant. Eutrophication for each section is less serious in autumn, more in spring and most in summer. Eutrophication degree gradually decreases from estuary to upstream, which is in conformity with reality. The RST of eutrophication in Da'ning River may inform environmental decision-makers and assist them in making more cost-effective decisions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Sampling proceeded on a monthly, diurnal and depth-wise basis. Annual mean photoheterotrophic uptake was estimated at 2.6 .mu.g C/m3 per h. Two periods of relatively high activity were observed: 1 during spring overturn and the 2nd during the late summer period. In general, greatest contributions to overall C cycling occurred during morning to midday incubation periods and at intermediate depths within the water column. Rates of chemoheterotrophy averaged 6.9 .mu.g C/m3 per h and were relatively uniform throughout the annual period. Greatest overall chemoheterotrophic activity was associated with periods of overturn. This activity generally increased throughout the day and with increasing depth within the water column. The annual mean for photolithotrophic fixation was 1.33 mg C/m3 per h. Greatest contributions to rates of photosynthesis were associated with epilimnetic waters during early morning and midday incubations. Relatively minor contributions to inorganic fixation were made to waters below the 6 contour. Spring overturn and late summer represented periods of particularly great photolithotrophic activity. Quantitative comparisons among C pathways indicate that rates of pelagic heterotrophy, both photo- and chemoheterotropyy combined, contribute small quantities of C to overall C metabolism in this oligotrophic system. Qualitative comparisons among pathways indicate strong spatial and temporal separation. The late summer period showed greatest seasonal separation of the 3 pathways. Spring values represented a period of relatively high activity for all 3 pathways. On a depth-wise basis, photolithotrophic activity was greatest near the surface and chemolithotrophic activity greatest near the bottom. Photoheterotrophy took an intermediate position between the 2. Diurnally, photoheterotrophy and photolithotrophy showed greatest activity during midday and early morning periods, whereas chemoheterotrophy increased throughout the daylight period and reached maxiaml values in sunset incubations.																			0095-3628	1432-184X					1979	5	1					1	15		10.1007/BF02010573	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02010573								24232294					WOS:A1979GR84800001

The Danjiangkou Reservoir is the water source area of the Middle Route Project of the South-to-North Water Diversion in China. Its water quality is of critical importance to the safety of water diversion. TOC concentration and other environmental factors at 19 sampling sites in the Danjiangkou Reservoir were investigated quarterly during 2020-2021 to explore the differences at the spatio-temporal scales. A generalized additive model (GAM) was used to analyze the environmental factors correlated with the observed spatio-temporal variations of TOC concentration. The results showed that the comprehensive trophic level index (TLI) of the Danjiangkou Reservoir was under the state of intermediate nutrition, and the water quality was overall good. In terms of temporal patterns, TOC concentration was higher in both spring and summer and lower in other seasons. Spatially, TOC concentrations were found in descending order from the site of outlet, Han reservoir, entrance of reservoir, and Dan reservoir. The single-factor GAM model showed that TOC correlated with different environmental factors across spatio-temporal scales. Water temperature (WT), permanganate index (CODMn), and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) were significantly correlated with TOC in autumn, but only total nitrogen (TN) and transparency (SD) were significant in winter. Spatially, WT, chemical oxygen demand (COD), NH4+-N, TN, and conductivity (Cond) correlated with TOC in the Dan reservoir, but WT, COD, NH4+-N, total phosphorus (TP), and chlorophyll a (Chl.a) were significant in the Han reservoir. The multi-factor GAM model indicated that the environmental factors correlated with TOC concentration were mainly WT, TN, Cond, CODMn, and TP, among which WT and Cond showed a significant linear relationship with TOC concentration (edf = 1, p < 0.05), while TN, CODMn, and TP had a significant nonlinear relationship with TOC concentration (edf > 1, p < 0.05). Comprehensive trophic level index (TLI) and TOC concentration revealed a highly significant correlation (R-2 = 0.414, p < 0.001). Therefore, the GAM model could well explain the environmental factors associated with the spatio-temporal dynamics of TOC concentration, providing a reference for the evaluation of water quality and research on the carbon cycle in similar inland reservoirs.

J	Hélie, JF; Hillaire-Marcel, C; Rondeau, B				Hélie, JF; Hillaire-Marcel, C; Rondeau, B			Seasonal changes in the sources and fluxes of dissolved inorganic carbon through the St. Lawrence River -: isotopic and chemical constraint	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												The St. Lawrence River ranks 16(th) in the world rivers for its freshwater discharge into the ocean, but its particulate fluxes are relatively low due the upstream presence of the Great Lakes system. Using notably C-13 measurements in total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) at several stations along stream, earlier studies provided information on dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) fluxes through the St. Lawrence, with some constraints on spatial trends with respect to the in situ DIC metabolism. Here, we further document annual DIC-fluxes and seasonal changes in DIC supplies and DIC-metabolism, downstream. Chemical and isotopic measurements were performed in 1998, on a biweekly basis, at four different sites. These sites represent respectively the Great Lakes outflow into the St. Lawrence system, supplies from two tributaries (one with a silicate-rich Precambrian bedrock, the other with a carbonate-rich Paleozoic bedrock), and the St. Lawrence outflow into the maritime estuarine system. The 1998 survey yielded a total annual DIC flux of similar to6 x 10(12) to 7 x 10(12) g of carbon at the Quebec City outlet, about 40% higher than estimates from earlier studies. This represents about 1.5% of the world river DIC supplies to the ocean. Very strong seasonal variations are observed between the summer low water levels, when water supplies from the Great Lakes into the riverine system may represent up to 80% of the total outflow of the St. Lawrence River, and the spring snowmelt period, when tributaries may provide up to 80% of this outflow. delta(13)C-DIC values respond to this seasonal cycle, with near isotopic-equilibrium values with atmospheric CO2 during summer, and strongly depleted values in other seasons, notably during the spring high outflow period. This seasonal isotopic cycle is more pronounced at the Quebec City outlet, where the influence of 13 C-depleted DIC supplies from tributaries is stronger than upstream. The low delta(13)C-DIC values observed from fall to spring, may be due to a combination of the following factors: (i) enhanced supplies of C-13-depeleted DIC from soils and ground waters from watersheds, (ii) higher oxidation rates of dissolved or particulate (13) C-depleted organic carbon, and (iii) a reduced incidence of the in situ photosynthetic activity. The outflow and isotopic seasonal cycles result notably in a strong negative correlation between delta(13)C-DIC values and discharge rates. Estimates of DIC supplies from tributaries vs. those from the Great Lakes were calculated using either chemical or isotopic approaches. DIC supplies from tributaries vary between similar to5% and 60% of total DIC. Examination of pCO(2) data indicates a negligible seasonal variability at the Great Lakes outlet, with a mean annual value near equilibrium with atmospheric CO2. In contrast, strong seasonal changes are observed downstream, at Quebec City, with minimum pCO(2) values in summer and a mean annual value of similar to1300 ppmv, suggesting that the St. Lawrence River system in its later course acts as a source for atmospheric CO2, during most of the year.

Previous studies have revealed that the precipitation/moisture variations between NMA and ACA show an out-of-phase or anti-phase relationship on a multi-millennial timescale during the Holocene. However, considering the profound impact of precipitation and related vegetation changes on dust storms, it is unclear whether disparities exist in the variations and mechanisms governing Holocene dust storms between these two regions. Here we use a compilation of Holocene dust storm records from both NMA and ACA, combined with proxy-model comparisons, to demonstrate a consistent temporal pattern of dust storm activity between these regions, with an overall increasing trend on a multi-millennial timescale during the Holocene. Comparison of these dust storm records with regional climate records reveals that surface landscape dominated by the summer monsoon precipitation were the dominant controls on dust storm activity in NMA during the Holocene. In contrast, given the Holocene wetting trend observed for ACA, we propose that precipitation had only a limited influence on modulating the regional dust storms in this region; furthermore, the increasing frequency of dust storms cannot be attributed to decreasing winter monsoon intensity. Instead, we argue that the intensified dust storms in ACA during the late Holocene were triggered by the increased strength and northward (southward) movement of the spring (summer) westerly jet. By revealing the differences in the mechanisms of dust storms across arid inner Asia, our findings provide a scientific basis for implementing policies for dust storm management that can be adapted to meet specific local conditions.

Due to scarce observations, the hydroclimatic characteristics of the Tianshan Mountains Precipitation (TMP) measured over highland (>1500 m) regions remain to be revealed. Here, we show the TMP belongs to a monsoon-like climate regime, with a distinct annual range and a high ratio of summer-to-yearly rainfall, and exhibits six abrupt changes, dividing the annual cycle into six precipitation sub-seasons. Over the past 60 years, the yearly TMP has significantly increased by 17.3%, with a dramatic increase in winter (135.7%). The TMP displays a significant 40-day climatological intra-seasonal oscillation (CISO) in summer. The TMP CISO's wet phase results from the confrontation of the eastward propagating mid-tropospheric Balkhash Lake Low and the southward migrating Mongolian High. The sudden changes in the two climatological circulation systems trigger TMP's changes, shaping the 40-day CISO. Emerging scientific issues are also discussed.					; Cheng, Tat Fan/HTS-8503-2023; Wang, Jake/AAT-3308-2020; Wang, Bin/ABZ-9828-2022	Cheng, Franklin T.

We present a new palaeoclimate record based on total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), TOC/TN ratios, and carbon isotope analyses of organic carbon (delta 13Corg) from Lake Suigetsu (Japan) back to 146 ka. We extend the Lake Suigetsu sediment chronology beyond the well-constrained radiocarbon limit based on (1) tephrochronology, and (2) tephrostratigraphy. Finally (3), we carefully test the hypothesis that the common pattern in Cryptomeria pollen concentration between Lake Suigetsu and marine core MD01-2421 located in the northern Pacific Ocean can be used to refine our chronology.scales. Sediment deposition between 146 and 120 ka is heavily influenced by the early tectonic formation of Lake Suigetsu, as indicated by alternating deposition of peat and occasionally limited clay. Since 120 ka, spectral and wavelet analyses in concert with cross-wavelet analyses against ice core, marine, and atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration records, and moving window correlation analyses against transient climate model data, provide insights into a complex interplay between palaeoclimate conditions in central Japan and orbital and atmospheric circulation forcing. We find a strong correspondence between Lake Suigetsu proxy data, modelled winter precipitation, orbital configuration, and atmospheric circulation, which cannot be attributed to summer monsoon intensity and high insolation forcing as often reported from China. This is likely due to the location of Lake Suigetsu at the north-eastern margin of the Asian monsoon system. The data imply a dominance of winter monsoon influences, and that a southerly migration of the westerly jet stream in relation to the Himalayan Plateau during winter insolation maxima improves oceanic moisture uptake, promoting enhanced winter rainfall in Japan. The development of a strong North Pacific High during summer insolation maxima, in turn, may have blocked moisture transport to Japan during summer.

NORTHERN SAW-WHET OWL (AEGOLIUS ACADICUS) AUTUMN MIGRATION MAGNITUDE AND DEMOGRAPHICS IN SOUTH-CENTRAL INDIANA	JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH												Three banding stations were located in south-central Indiana (2002-07) to study, migration patterns of Northern Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus). Saw-whet owl captures ranged from 59 in 2002 (1 station) to 447 in 2007 (3 stations), with 2007 an irruption year in at least one location. The proportion of hatch-year owls was 54.8% on average, hut lower in 2004 (30.9%). Hatch-year owls consistently arrived 4-5 d earlier than older saw-whet owls in south-central Indiana. We used morphometric sexing techniques to classify 80% of the saw-whet owls we captured as females, and 7% as males. Encounters of birds banded ill other stations indicated that most owls captured in south-central Indiana ill fall had migrated around the west side of the Great. Lakes. The irruption of 2007 was likely due to a large influx of saw-whel owls moving through the Ohio River Valley from eastern regions. Greatest numbers of saw-whet owl captures were associated with clear nights and relatively calin west-to-northwest winds after the passage of a cold front. For owls captured in our station and another, we calculated the average migration rate of 28.8 +/- 15.8 km/d (N = 9).																			0892-1016	2162-4569				SEP	2009	43	3					199	209		10.3356/JRR-08-51.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.3356/JRR-08-51.1													WOS:000270099200002

Vendace (Coregonus albula) disperse their eggs widely during spawning	ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI												Depending on their reproductive strategy, different fish species either aggregate or disperse eggs and larvae in their reproductive habitat. Because yolk-sac larvae of vendace (Coregonus albula) disperse widely across the littoral and pelagic zones of boreal lakes, it is unclear where the exact spawning and egg incubation locations are. Vendace egg and larvae densities were studied in Lake Southern Konnevesi to clarify its spawning strategy. In autumn 2019.1-2 weeks prior to spawning, 500 egg samplers were installed in five depth zones in 20 sampling plots. Fertilized eggs were found in 18 plots. The mean density of eggs was 74 eggs m(-2) and the mean fertilization rate 85%. During spawning, vendace dispersed their offspring throughout the lake. The sampling-plot-specific egg density in autumn 2019 did not correlate with larval density in the spring next year. The reproduction strategy of vendace reduces the effects of high spatial and temporal fluctuation in their reproduction and nursery habitats.					; Karjalainen, Juha/B-4079-2015	Marjomaki, Timo J./0000-0002-0563-3099; Karjalainen, Juha/0000-0001-9302-1174													0003-455X	1797-2450				AUG	2021	58	4-6					141	153		10.5735/086.058.0403	http://dx.doi.org/10.5735/086.058.0403													WOS:000694007600003

Seasonal variations in aridity and temperature characterize changing climate during the last deglaciation in New Zealand	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												New multiproxy records of aridity from northern New Zealand assess the seasonality and overall pattern of wetness through the Last Glacial Coldest Period (LGCP) to the early Holocene in the subtropical Southwest Pacific. Biomass burning indicators based on terrestrial biomarkers and delta C-13 of individual plant leaf wax carbon compounds (n-alkanoic acids) from a maar lake were used to track aridity. In combination with published sea surface temperatures and new pollen-based temperature estimates from the same core, seasonal climatological changes in the Auckland area were determined from 27 to 9 cal. ka BP. These proxies document a shift from cold and dry conditions in the Last Glacial Maximum to seasonally wetter conditions through the deglaciation. Spring became warmer first and possibly wetter while summers remained drier and initially cooler. The progression from cold-dry to warm-wet was punctuated by the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR) which stands out as having wetter conditions in both spring and summer and mild cooling largely concentrated in spring. The seasonal climate trends observed here can be plausibly explained by a rapid change from a subpolar climate to one with subtropical control in this region of the southwest Pacific across the Last Glacial to Interglacial transition. A southerly shift and decreasing intensity of the westerly wind belt after the LGCP is considered to have driven the early deglacial warming and pulse of wetness whereas a northward shift without a commensurate increase in intensity of the westerlies may explain conditions in the ACR.

J.; Boersma, Maarten			Resilience of North Sea phytoplankton spring bloom dynamics: An analysis of long-term data at Helgoland Roads	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Analyzing one of the most extensive long-term data series in the North Sea, the Helgoland Roads time series, we investigated the changes in the factors that potentially drive phytoplankton bloom dynamics in the German Bight. We compared the changes in these factors with the changes in the spring bloom phenology. We combined zooplankton, nutrient, weather, and phytoplankton data to analyze whether there has been a shift in trophic interactions in the North Sea affecting the spring bloom timing. The potential influence of temperature, with a mean increase of 1.5 degrees C, was investigated. We showed that the German Bight around Helgoland is a highly dynamic system and has undergone considerable change in the last 30 yr. Nutrient levels, temperature, underwater light climate and wind speed have all changed. However, the spring bloom dynamics have hardly changed at all. We showed that the spring bloom tends to come later in warmer years but that this is not directly correlated with the overall warming trend. The known regime shift of the late 1980s is clearly visible in our data in terms of average phytoplankton winter densities and average cell size, but even so the start of the spring bloom has not changed.

J	Watts, WA; Allen, JRM; Huntley, B; Fritz, SC				Watts, WA; Allen, JRM; Huntley, B; Fritz, SC			Vegetation history and climate of the last 15,000 years at Laghi di Monticchio, southern Italy	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												In southern Italy, vegetation contemporary with the end of the last glacial maximum, from 15,000 to 12,000 years ago, is shown by pollen-analysis to have been treeless and steppe-like in character. At 12,500 BP (years before present), Betula (birch) expanded into the steppe, quickly followed by Quercus (oak), Fagus (beech), Tilia (lime) and other tree genera of mesic forest. High percentages of Tilia point to a rich mesic forest that was contemporary with the 'Allerod' interstadial of northern Europe. A major decline in mesic trees with an accompanying return of Betula and steppe genera dated to 10,500 years ago identifies a 'Younger Duyas' climatic reversal. Betula and steppe genera were replaced by forest of Quercus and other mesic trees, notably Ulmus (elm), as the Holocene began. In the later Holocene, ca. 4000 years ago, Abies (fir), Carpinus betulus (hornbeam) and Taxus (yew) appeared. Abies and Taxus became extinct locally about 2500 years ago, either because of climatic change, or perhaps because of the effects of early agriculture. The Full-glacial climate is thought to have been cold and summer-dry with mainly winter precipitation. The Lateglacial 'Bolling-Allerod' Interstadial was summer-wet and warm. The response-surface based climate reconstruction indicates an early Holocene climate with markedly colder winter conditions than today, about -5 degrees C compared with 3.9 degrees C today as a mean temperature for the coldest month. The annual temperature sum is reconstructed as somewhat higher than today, 3500 degree days as compared with a calculated value of 2900 for today. The later Holocene had a climate like today's. Rainfall, and variation in its seasonal distribution, has been a critical determinant of the vegetation cover. The fossil pollen record at Laghi Di Monticchio has been complemented by diatom and plant macrofossil studies which provide evidence of former lake environments as well as data on the upland forest. Lake levels remained high during the Full- and Lateglacial with encroachment of shore vegetation during the Holocene. The sediments also have an exceptionally rich record of tephra falls which are of importance in dating and core correlation. Twenty-one macroscopically visible tephras occur in sediments of the last 15,000 years.

Simulation of the hydrological impacts of climate change on a restored floodplain	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL												Thirty UK Climate Projections 2009 (UKCP09) scenarios are simulated using a MIKE SHE/MIKE 11 model of a restored floodplain in eastern England. Annual precipitation exhibits uncertainty in direction of change. Extreme changes (10 and 90% probability) range between -27 and +30%. The central probability projects small declines (<-4%). Wetter winters and drier summers predominate. Potential evapotranspiration increases for most scenarios (annual range of change: -41 to +2%). Declines in mean discharge predominate (range: -41 to +25%). Reductions of 11-17% are projected for the central probability. High and low flows, and the frequency of bankfull discharge exceedence reduce in most cases. Duration of winter high floodplain water tables declines. Summer water tables are on average at least 0.11 and 0.18 m lower for the 2050s and 2080s, respectively. Flood extent declines in most scenarios. Drier conditions will likely induce ecological responses including impacts on floodplain vegetation.

Long-term meteorological data showed that recent climate change, including warmer winters, increased precipitation intensity and extended dry periods, may have influenced the basin of Lake Paldang, the most downstream reservoir of a series of on-river reservoirs. Extreme hydrologic events and climate warming, acting independently and in combination, appear to be related to changes in the Lake Paldang ecosystem. A significant increase in chlorophyll a concentrations in early spring corresponded to the timing of ice break-up. An increase in winter temperatures, which resulted in a shorter time period of ice-cover and earlier ice break-up, appears to have stimulated phytoplankton growth in winter and early spring. Repeated intensive and extended influxes of turbid water, associated with more frequent extreme rainfall events, have increased concentration of suspended solids and may have influenced the biotic community structure of Lake Paldang. In the mid-2000s, the area vegetated by submerged hydrophytes, the abundance and biomass of the phylum Mollusca, as well as the abundance of fish from the subfamily Acheilognathinae, which spawn in the body of bivalve molluscs, was all smaller than in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Together, these results suggest that climate change may have contributed directly and indirectly to changes in each trophic level of the Lake Paldang ecosystem.

To clarify this issue, we explored the community assembly processes and cooccurrence networks in four seasons at two depths (epilimnion and hypolimnion) in a mesotrophic and stratified lake (Chenghai Lake), which formed stratification in the summer and turnover in the winter. During the stratification period, the epilimnion and hypolimnion went through contrary assembly processes but converged to similar assembly patterns in the mixing period. In a highly homogeneous selection environment, species with low niche breadth were filtered, resulting in decreased species richness. Water mixing in the winter homogenized the environment, resulting in a simpler microbial cooccurrence network. Interestingly, we observed a high abundance of the cyanobacterial genus Planktothrix in the winter, probably due to nutrient redistribution and Planktothrix adaptivity to the winter environment in which mixing played important roles. Our study provides deeper fundamental insights into how environmental factors influence microbial community structure through community assembly processes.

Quantification of individual phosphorus forms in surface sediments of the Southern Caspian Sea - Iranian Coast: A sequential extraction procedure	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES												Seventy Two sediments from four stations (Anzali, Tonekabon, Noshahr and Amirabad), located in Caspian Sea-Iranian coast were examined on the basis of P-fractionation in autumn and winter of 2013-2014. Several forms of the phosphorus in sediment were separated and extracted according to sequential extraction method. Then the extracted phosphorus in each fraction was determined by UV Vis spectrophotometry. In addition, Total concentrations of Ca, Fe and Al in sediment fractions were also measured by Atomic absorption spectroscopy. In autumn the rank order of P-fractions was: Ca-P>Residual-P>BD-P>Al-P>loosely-P and in winter it was: Ca-P>BD-P>Residual-P>Al-P>loosely adsorbed-P. In both season the loosely adsorbed phosphorus (NH4Cl-P) represented < 1% of the sedimentary inorganic phosphorus, while the reductant phosphorus (BD P) ranged from 2.7 to 4%. The calcium bound phosphorus (Ca-P or HCl-P) showed considerable contribution (89-91%) to the sedimentary inorganic P-loads. The metal oxide bound phosphorus (Al-P or NaOH P) was 1.2-1.5% and Residual-P was 2.3-4.5%. Concentration of BD- P increased with increasing depth in all stations and the concentration of other fractions increased in most stations. Sampling seasons had significant effect on variance of most P-fractions and other sediment features. TP and BD-P were positively correlated with Fetot (p<0.05).

High prevalence of basin fidelity and homing by lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in a small northern lake	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Identifying how habitat structure influences the spatiotemporal movements of fishes is important for conservation, population assessment, and management purposes. Here, we determined whether acoustically tagged lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) from a 305 ha lake exhibited homing behaviour and lake basin fidelity over multiple seasons and years. The lake has two distinct deep basins (north and south) connected by a shallower centre basin. Fifteen lake trout captured during the spawning season from both deep basins were tagged and released in the south basin. All translocated north-basin fish quickly returned to the north basin (median = 1.85 days, range = 0.36-4.5 days), apart from one fish that returned 41 days post-release, while none from the south ventured into the north basin during this time. After translocated individuals returned, all fish demonstrated high basin fidelity among years, as >90% of detections were from the same basin fish were captured, while <0.7% (by three fish) were from the opposite deep basin and <9% from the centre basin. The probability a fish was detected outside its basin of capture was highest in winter (15.9%) and fall (14.3%) and lowest in summer (0.41%).																			0706-652X	1205-7533				MAY	2022	79	5					825	833		10.1139/cjfas-2021-0219	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2021-0219		OCT 2021											WOS:000788309700001

The combined use of radio frequency-electromagnetic surveys and chemical and biological analyses to study the role of groundwater discharge into the Guadiana estuary	ECOHYDROLOGY												This paper intends to show how the radio frequency-electromagnetic (RF-EM) method can be successfully used in coastal wetlands, onshore and in shallow water. It characterizes and reveals geological and hydrogeological singularities that are often hidden by recent sediments and allows target sampling and consequent detection of ecological particularities. RF-EM methods have traditionally been used to detect the presence of groundwater or the existence of subsurface contamination plumes. The great majority of such studies have been conducted on land and to a lesser extent on freshwater lakes but rarely in coastal waters. Previous research in Portugal has shown that despite the attenuation effect of salt water, very valuable information can be obtained with the use of electromagnetic methods, wherever resistivity contrasts exist. In the current case study, RF-EM surveys were carried out in the Estuary of the Guadiana River, in order to understand the importance of geological structures on the formation of the wetland and the influence of groundwater discharge on the existing ecosystem. Structures detected on land were also identified in the tidal channels. Freshwater fault springs were localized; their biota is characterized and the nutrients analysed. The results showed a clear increase in nitrate and silica concentration near the submarine springs, with impact on the planktonic communities, which is most evident in chlorophyll a. This is especially relevant during the end of summer and autumn when a potential limitation of these nutrients exists that can increase the occurrence of toxic blooms in the salt marshes and lower estuary.

The contribution of dreissenid soft tissue and shell, as biotic phases, in element distribution and its interaction with the water and upper sediment phases were examined in two basins with different trophic conditions in spring and autumn. Six metals (Ba, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, Zn) were detected in all investigated phases. In general, metals were abundant in the water and soft tissue in the eastern basin in spring, and in the sediment and shells in the western basin in autumn. This might be associated with the more urbanized surroundings in the eastern, and the enhanced organic matter production in the western basin. High relative shares of Ba, Cu, Mn, and Pb were associated with the water and shell samples, whereas high shares of Fe and Zn were noted in the soft mussel tissue and sediments. Results suggest that dynamics of metal uptake by dreissenids depend on the seasonal change in metabolic activity. Shell metal content is less changeable; shells might absorb metals from both the soft tissue and water phases. Metallothionein peptides, the scavengers of intracellular metals, were determined to be biomarkers of the bulk contaminants rather than only metals. The present study shows that invasive bivalves, with high abundance, filtering activity, and storing capacity can significantly contribute to element distribution in the shoreline of a shallow lake ecosystem.

J	Mazoyer, F; Laurion, I; Rautio, M				Mazoyer, Flora; Laurion, Isabelle; Rautio, Milla			The dominant role of sunlight in degrading winter dissolved organic matter from a thermokarst lake in a subarctic peatland	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) leaching from thawing permafrost may promote a positive feedback on the climate if it is efficiently mineralized into greenhouse gases. However, many uncertainties remain on the extent of this mineralization, which depends on DOM lability that is seemingly quite variable across landscapes. Thermokarst peatlands are organic-rich systems where some of the largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emission rates have been measured. At spring turnover, anoxic waters release the GHG accumulated in winter, and the DOM pool is exposed to sunlight. Here, we present an experiment where DOM photoreactivity and bioreactivity were investigated in water collected from a thermokarst lake in a subarctic peatland during late winter (after 6 months of darkness). We applied treatment with or without light exposure, and manipulated the bacterial abundance with the aim to quantify the unique and combined effects of light and bacteria on DOM reactivity at ice-off in spring. We demonstrate that sunlight was clearly driving the transformation of the DOM pool, part of which went through a complete mineralization into CO2. Up to 18% of the initial dissolved organic carbon (DOC, a loss of 3.9 mgCL(-1)) was lost over 18 d of sunlight exposure in a treatment where bacterial abundance was initially reduced by 95 %. However, sunlight considerably stimulated bacterial growth when grazers were eliminated, leading to the recovery of the original bacterial abundance in about 8 d, which may have contributed to the DOC loss. Indeed, the highest DOC loss was observed for the treatment with the full bacterial community exposed to sunlight (5.0 mgCL(-1)), indicating an indirect ef- fect of light through the bacterial consumption of photoproducts. Dark incubations led to very limited changes in DOC, regardless of the bacterial abundance and activity. The results also show that only half of the light-associated DOC losses were converted into CO2, and we suggest that the rest potentially turned into particles through photoflocculation. Sunlight should therefore play a major role in DOM processing, CO2 production and carbon burial in peatland lakes during spring, likely lasting for the rest of the open season in mixing surface layers.

Discrete thermal windows cause opposite response of sympatric cold-water fish species to annual temperature variability	ECOSPHERE												Cold-water fish populations in lakes are predicted to be most vulnerable to global warming due to their geographical isolation and their requirement for habitats with low temperatures. In contrast, higher fisheries catches of cold-water species often correlate with warmer winter and spring temperatures. Mechanistic understanding of the relationships between annual temperatures and population densities can only be achieved by integrating physiology and behavioral ecology of the focal species, an approach that has so far not been applied to freshwater fish populations. We took advantage from a unique biological system, the coexistence of two cold-water Coregonus species in a deep lake. These fish species show discrete thermal windows (4-5 degrees C vs. 7-9 degrees C) and life histories (spring-vs. autumn-spawning). We analyzed short (6-11 years) time series of pelagic fish densities obtained by hydroacoustics and trawl catches, their zooplankton prey densities, and water temperature in Lake Stechlin (Germany). Young-of-year fish densities increased after warm winters. In contrast, densities of juveniles and adults were correlated with metalimnetic June temperatures, but an opposite response direction of the sympatric species was caused by their discrete thermal windows. Densities of the species with a 4-5 degrees C thermal optimum increased in years with warm June, whereas densities of the other species with a 7-9 degrees C optimum declined in these warm years. The occupied depths of both populations at night shifted towards less suitable water temperatures if densities of the competing species increased, suggesting interactive niche segregation. Therefore, growth of fishes may be reduced and hence mortality increased by additional metabolic costs induced by occurrence in layers outside of the metabolic optima. Temperature-driven inter-and intra-specific competition in the metalimnetic layer may cause a complex response of cold-water fish assemblages in lakes to warming. More approaches testing the relative performance of interacting species are needed to improve predictions on the consequences of global change on lake ecosystems.

Twenty five species of aquatic fauna were recorded from the cores, comprising 20 species of metazoan, predominantly Crustacea (including Melita kauerti (Amphipoda), Exophaeroma cf. serventii (Isopoda); and Cyprideis australiensis (Ostracoda); Polychaeta (Capitella cf. capitata); nematodes and five species of Foraminifera (Protista). Multivariate analysis of the five numerically most abundant taxa (amphipods, isopods. ostracods, polychaetes., nematodes) separated microbialites by season and submergence. Numbers of all taxa, particularly polychaetes and amphipods, were much higher in spring than in autumn, and in permanently-inundated than in seasonally-inundated microbialites. The exception was higher numbers of juvenile polychaetes in seasonally-inundated microbialites at the northern site in spring, This study showed that modern thrombolitic microbialites can co-exist with a diverse invertebrate fauna and serves as a baseline for future studies of interactions between microbialites and fauna.

The following field study aims to uncover patterns in temporal variability in water quality and phytoplankton abundance, diversity and assemblage structure, in the upper and lower water bodies of the Myall Lakes system. The result showed that the two lakes differ greatly in their catchment to lake area ratios, freshwater inputs, degree of saline intrusion, light attenuation and submerged macrophyte biomass. The broadwater, which receives large inputs of freshwater from the catchment, and is influenced by saline inputs from the Port Stephen's estuary, exhibited highly variable water quality and dissolved nutrient concentrations, and phytoplankton assemblages with much temporal variation in taxa present, biovolume, cell size and abundance, and taxonomic diversity. In contrast, the upper lake, Myall Lake, shows much greater stability in water chemistry and nutrient availability; the phytoplankton community is diverse, with relatively low and constant biovolume, and is dominated year-round by small-celled cyanobacteria. Differences in phytoplankton between the two lakes were greatest during the autumn and winter, and least during the summer, when the phytoplankton assemblages in both lakes were dominated by similar cyanophyte taxa.

When assimilation number by natural phytoplankton assemblages collected eight times throughout 1995 was measured in the laboratory using an experimental-manipulative approach at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees C, the optimum temperature for assimilation number showed a significant positive relationship with ambient temperature. The optimum temperature shifted from a low of 11 degrees C for the winter community to 30 degrees C for the summer community. The following second order equation (r(2) = 0.91) adequately described the relationship between optimum temperature for assimilation number (OptT) and ambient temperature (AmbT); OptT = 13.75 + [(5.067 x 10(-3)) (AmbT)] + [(1.55 x 10(-2)) (AmbT)(2)]. The assimilation number of the winter phytoplankton measured at 5 degrees C was almost 165 % greater than carbon assimilation of the summer phytoplankton measured at 5 degrees C, while the assimilation number of the winter phytoplankton measured at 30 degrees C was about 75 % less than the summer phytoplankton measured at 30 degrees C. These data suggest that adaptations which allow for greater carbon assimilation during one seasonal extreme preclude equivalent or greater carbon assimilation at the opposite seasonal extreme. It appears that the same phytoplankton community cannot maintain optimal carbon assimilation rates at both cold and warm temperatures. and that phytoplankton communities adapt to seasonal change in temperature. These data demonstrate that the optimum temperature of carbon assimilation for freshwater phytoplankton can vary with seasonal change in ambient temperature.																			0003-9136					MAR	1998	141	4					389	401																WOS:000072984200002
J	Tan, GR; Wang, XZ; Wang, YG; Miao, Y				Tan, Guirong; Wang, Xuezong; Wang, Yongguang; Miao, Yu			Possible causes of the excessive precipitation over South China in 2021/22 winter	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												Based on monthly rainfall station data from the National Climate Prediction Center of China Meteorological Administration, reanalysis monthly data from NCEP/NCAR including the monthly mean and long-term mean values for geopotential height, winds of multi-levels, NOAA(National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) monthly Sea Surface Temperature (ERSSTV5), the causes of anomalous excessive precipitation in 2021/2022 winter over South China (SC) are investigated by Liang-Kleeman information flow, composite and wave flux methods. The results show that the winter precipitation over SC in 2021/2022 DJF is far more than normal, and the associated circulation patterns are obviously different from those induced by traditional La Nin tilde a, especially in the Atlantic and East Asia areas south to Lake Baikal. In 2021/2022 DJF, the Tibet Plateau (TP) exists anomalous cyclone with strong ascending motion, which directly affects the circulation patterns in Eastern China and thus the precipitation in SC. It is a significant causal relationship for the earlier season velocity potential at 850 hPa (related to the anomalous SST) over the tropical Atlantic to later DJF anomalous vertical motions over TP. Especially when the anomalies in tropical Atlantic leads one month before, the relationship is closest. The anomalies of the tropical Atlantic can stimulate the Rossby wave train which propagates downstream, corresponding to the abnormal cyclonic circulation over TP. In the early autumn to winter of 2021/2022, the 850 hPa potential velocity anomalies in the tropical Atlantic were significant with positive phase. The Rossby wave train excited by the potential velocity anomalies and then propagated along the great circle path and global jet stream (GJT) over South Asia (SA), formed an anomalous cyclonic with ascending motion over TP and lead more precipitation over SC in winter of 2021/2022. Winter rainfall, usually accompanying with lower temperature, will bring severely bad influence on traffic, power supply, communication, agriculture and people's lives. The results of this paper can provide a reference for further understanding the causes and mechanism of DJF rainfall over SC.

N 97.degree. E) and Southern Indian Lake (57.degree. N 99.degree. W) had similar phytoplankton cycles during their open water seasons. A brief spring algal maximum was followed by an early summer minimum and, subsequently, an extended autumnal increase when highest biomasses were observed. The maxima were dominated by Melosira spp. The seasonal cycle of Melosira followed closely the seasonal cycle of dissolved Si. These basins exhibited a typical phytoplankton cycle for dimictic lakes even though they did not form a significant thermocline (1.degree. C per meter). The lakes were well-mixed because they were shallow and had large wind fetches. Although thermal stability of the water column was always low, it was positive until maximum heat content was achieved at which time it became nil or negative. These lakes heated and cooled rapidly, and sediment heat storage was a substantial fraction of the total heat budget. Because heating and cooling of water and of sediments were out of phase, heat exchange at the sediment surface could control vertical circulation of interstitial water, nutrient exchange across the sediment-water interface and the seasonality of phytoplankton. Thermal gradients in the sediments during the heating season would be quite pronounced (4.degree. C per meter). It is proposed that positive stability in interstitial waters during the heating season would impose molecular diffusive transport on the sediment column. When the lakes begin to cool, the upper interstitial water column would become thermally unstable and circulation would occur within the sediments. This would result in the observed net flux of dissolved Si, and other nutrients, out of the sediments into the overlying waters. As a consequence, in Lake Winnipeg and Southern Indian Lake the highest phytoplankton biomasses and productivity occurred in the late summer and autumn.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG 5	1986	138						117	126		10.1007/BF00027235	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00027235													WOS:A1986E070900009

They ranged from 0.131-0.306 g O2 .cntdot. m-2 day-1. They were not correlated with lake depth, in contrast with the winter respiration rates of temperate lakes. This difference may result from lower summer temperatures and a lower proportion of planktonic respiration in arctic as compared with temperate lakes. 14C estimates of annual photosynthesis were generally lower than estimated annual respiration, and the 14C-measured photosynthesis beneath the ice in late winter was generally too low to account for the actual amounts of O2 evolved by photosynthesis. In 1 lake, a 50% increase in annual production resulted in an increase of only 19% in winter respiration, suggesting that lake respiration is an integrative process that averages out production over a period of years. Addition of methane gas to simulate a gas pipeline break to a lake resulted in an immediate 67% increase in lake respiration rate.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1985	42	3					521	528		10.1139/f85-069	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f85-069													WOS:A1985AEK9300014
J	SCHAETZL, RJ; ISARD, SA				SCHAETZL, RJ; ISARD, SA			THE DISTRIBUTION OF SPODOSOL SOILS IN SOUTHERN MICHIGAN - A CLIMATIC INTERPRETATION	ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS												This study describes and explains the geographic distribution of Spodosol soils (Podzols) on a regional scale. We employ a spatially-based, functional-factorial model of soil formation and, by holding four factors constant, are able to examine the effects of climate on soil genesis and distribution. Analysis of soils data for the southern peninsula of Michigan reveals that well and moderately well-drained, sandy Spodosols are found primarily in the northern half of the region in association with mixed coniferous-deciduous forest. Within this "Spodosol province," degree of soil development varies markedly. Differences in degree of soil development among sandy sites appear to be independent of present-day (or presettlement), regional vegetation patterns and may be related to variations in climate. Infiltration and "soil freezing potential," calculated using a hydrologic model, as well as air temperature records, are analyzed to ascertain which climate factors best correspond to observed trends in Spodosol development. Soils with strong spodic development exist in areas of northwestern southern (lower) Michigan that commonly experience deep lake-effect snows. Deep snowpacks in early winter inhibit soil frost, allowing for unrestricted infiltration of meltwater into the mineral soil during the spring snowmelt period (March and April). Correspondence between areas of increased autumn infiltration and strong Spodosol development suggests that wet soil conditions at the onset of winter also have impact on soil development, probably by inhibiting soil frost. Whereas the overall distribution of Spodosols is related to a coniferous component in the forest, variation in the degree of Spodosol development appears to be related to the frequency of years with high amounts of snowmelt infiltration, which intensifies the podzolization process.																			0004-5608					SEP	1991	81	3					425	442		10.1111/j.1467-8306.1991.tb01703.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8306.1991.tb01703.x													WOS:A1991GE82000004

In this paper, we have developed a TSM retrieval model for Lake Taihu using TSM concentrations measured in situ and a time series of quasi-synchronous MODIS 250 m images from 2005. After simple geometric and atmospheric correction, we found a significant relationship (R = 0.8736, N = 166) between in situ measured TSM concentrations and MODIS band normalization difference of band 3 and band 1. From this, we retrieved TSM concentrations in eight regions of Lake Taihu in 2007 and analyzed the characteristic distribution and variation of TSM. Synoptic maps of model-estimated TSM of 2007 showed clear geographical and seasonal variations. TSM in Central Lake and Southern Lakeshore were consistently higher than in other regions, while TSM in East Taihu was generally the lowest among the regions throughout the year. Furthermore, a wide range of TSM concentrations appeared from winter to summer. TSM in winter could be several times that in summer.																				1660-4601				SEP	2010	7	9					3545	3560		10.3390/ijerph7093545	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph7093545								20948942					WOS:000282224400017

The Physico-chemical characteristics of the water and soil samples were evaluated. pH was fluctuated in normal ranges between 7.93-8.74 during the study, while sulfate, phosphorus, copper and manganese were recorded high values more than the acceptable ranges. Microbiological analyses indicated the total coliform was too numerous to count and, therefore, warrants more attention. Total coliforms, thermotolerant coliforms, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Salmonella sp., Staphylococcus spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were detected in 5% of the water samples.

J	Vassiljev, J; Harrison, SP; Guiot, J				Vassiljev, J; Harrison, SP; Guiot, J			Simulating the Holocene lake-level record of Lake Bysjon, southern Sweden	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Lake Bysjon, southern Sweden, has experienced major lake-level lowerings during the Holocene, with one interval about 9000 C-14 yr B.P. when water level dropped ca. 7 m and the lake became closed, These changes were not solely due to known changes in radiation budgets or seasonal temperatures, Simulations with a lake-catchment model indicate that, given the actual changes in radiation and temperatures, all the observed lake-level lowerings (including the major lowering at 9000 degrees C yr B.P.) could have occurred in response to precipitation changes of <75 mm/yr when winter temperatures were warmer than today, In these circumstances, the reduction of runoff into the lake caused by increased evapotranspiration during the late winter and spring, combined with relatively small changes in precipitation, was sufficient for the lake to become closed, When winter temperatures were colder than today, the reduction in winter runoff related to reduced precipitation was only very slight and insufficient to lower the lake below threshold, In such circumstances, changes in outflow were sufficient to compensate for the combined changes in precipitation and runoff, and lake level therefore remained unchanged.

Hudsons Bay [England, UK] supported a large stand of water lilies, and the adjacent open water was clear with chlorophyll .alpha. concentrations generally < 10 .mu.g .cntdot. l-1. Hoveton Great Broad, which received inflow water from the same very fertile source, the River Bure, had chlorophyll a concentrations > 100 .mu.g .cntdot. l-1. Hudsons Bay water, in bioassays, could support great phytoplankton growth in summer and did so in spring and fall. The period of clear water coincided with the presence of the lily stand. Zooplankton populations were of rotifers and small-bodied Cladocera in Hoveton Great Braod, but mostly of Cladocera, including large-bodied individuals of plant-associated species, in Hudsons Bay. Zooplanktivorous fish were present and there was evidence of feeding them in both basins. Coexistence with fish of the large, apparently efficiently grazing Cladocera in Hudsons Bay depended on provision of daytime refuges for the Cladocera among the lilies, and grazing was greatest in the adjacent open water at night. Grazing control was helped by a hydrological regime which favored small and rapidly growing phytoplankters, rather than inedible colonial forms with slow growth. Weed-associated grazers may be important in maintaining the dominance of aquatic plants in shallow lakes which would otherwise more rapidly become dominated by phytoplankton as nutrient loading increased.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1984	29	3					472	486		10.4319/lo.1984.29.3.0472	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1984.29.3.0472													WOS:A1984SX74500002

A Seasonal to Interannual View of Inorganic and Organic Carbon and pH in Western Lake Superior	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												To investigate the carbon cycle of Lake Superior, Earth's largest freshwater lake by surface area, we performed total organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon, chlorophyll, spectrophotometric pH, total inorganic carbon, and alkalinity measurements on seasonal samples from the western lake. The last three parameters, along with in situ temperature, were used to calculate the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in surface water (pCO(2(w))) using the CO2SYS algorithm. There was a strong positive correlation between pH and water temperature and a weaker but significant positive correlation between pH and chlorophyll concentration. Total organic carbon exhibited higher nearshore concentrations (as determined by a negative correlation with total water column depth); such a spatial relationship did not appear in the inorganic carbon parameters (total inorganic carbon, pH, or pCO(2(w))). Western Lake Superior exhibited net outgassing in spring, little net gas transfer in summer, and some outgassing in the fall. The pCO(2(w)) values were negatively correlated with both water temperature and chlorophyll concentration. Seasonal differences in pCO(2(w)) in Lake Superior appeared more strongly driven by biology and terrestrial inputs as compared to direct effects of temperature on CO2 solubility. Interannual data from the long-term Great Lakes Environmental Database data set indicated that lake alkalinity has been increasing over the past 20years, and lake surface water pH appeared relatively stable. Modeling pH change over the same time frame in CO2SYS shows that increases in alkalinity and lake surface water temperature counteract the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, leading to a relatively constant pH, consistent with observational data. Plain Language Summary This study focused upon carbon cycling in western Lake Superior, investigating how biological, chemical, and physical changes interact to determine lake acidity and carbon dioxide content. On seasonal scales, biological and chemical changes play a strong role in carbon dioxide content relative to the effect of temperature on carbon dioxide solubility. Interannual trends over the past 20years show that the lake has not significantly changed in its level of acidity but that it has experienced an increase in its ability to neutralize added acid.

Additionally, the size and trophic structure of these microorganisms, and the influence of physical and chemical water parameters on their abundance, were analysed. Psammon samples were collected during spring, summer, and autumn of 2010. In each of the lakes samples were collected in the euarenal, higroarenal, and hydroarenal zones of the psammolittoral. In order to determine the micro-vertical distribution of ciliates, each sample was divided into two sub-samples: the upper part (0-1cm) and the lower part (1-2cm). The species diversity of ciliates decreased with depth. The tendency was particularly clear in mesotrophic lakes. Irrespective of the lake's trophic type and arenal zones, significantly higher numbers and biomass of ciliates were recorded in the surface layer of the psammolittoral. The upper layer of sand was dominated by omnivorous taxa, whereas the deeper layer showed increases in the proportions of bacterivore species. The factors limiting the occurrence of ciliates are mainly concentrations of total organic carbon and nutrients.

The FLake (Fresh-water Lake model) parameterisation is employed in the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model which is used operationally to produce global weather predictions. Lake depth and lake fraction are the main driving parameters in the FLake parameterisation. The lake parameter fields for the IFS should be global and realistic, because FLake runs over all the grid boxes, and then only lake-related results are used further. In this study new datasets and methods for generating lake fraction and lake depth fields for the IFS are proposed. The data include the new version of the Global Lake Database (GLDBv3) which contains depth estimates for unstudied lakes based on a geological approach, the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans and the Global Surface Water Explorer dataset which contains information on the spatial and temporal variability of surface water. The first new method suggested is a two-step lake fraction calculation; the first step is at 1 km grid resolution and the second is at the resolution of other grids in the IFS system. The second new method involves the use of a novel algorithm for ocean and inland water separation. This new algorithm may be used by anyone in the environmental modelling community. To assess the impact of using these innovations, in situ measurements of lake depth, lake water surface temperature and ice formation/disappearance dates for 27 lakes collected by the Finnish Environment Institute were used. A set of offline experiments driven by atmospheric forcing from the ECMWF ERAS Reanalysis were carried out using the IFS HTESSEL land surface model. In terms of lake depth, the new dataset shows a much lower mean absolute error, bias and error standard deviation compared to the reference set-up. In terms of lake water surface temperature, the mean absolute error is reduced by 13.4 %, the bias by 12.5 % and the error standard deviation by 20.3 %. Seasonal verification of the mixed layer depth temperature and ice formation/disappearance dates revealed a cold bias in the meteorological forcing from ERAS. Spring, summer and autumn verification scores confirm an overall reduction in the surface water temperature errors. For winter, no statistically significant change in the ice formation/disappearance date errors was detected.

Gill nets were used to capture and detect fish movements between the lakes. Lake trout were caught in the outlet of Upper Priest Lake and in the Thorofare (the narrow channel connecting the two lakes) primarily in the spring and fall, when water temperatures were cool. No lake trout were caught when the water temperature exceeded 15 degrees C. Lake trout were primarily caught at night (94%). Multiple regression analysis indicated that nighttime lake trout catch per unit effort (CPUE) was significantly higher at lower lake surface water temperatures than at higher temperatures (P < 0.01). Daytime take trout CPUE was significantly higher at low Priest Lake surface temperature than high temperature and at high Thorofare depth than at low depth (P < 0.01). Nighttime CRUE was significantly higher than daytime CPUE (P < 0.01). These results indicate that warm summer water temperatures function as a natural thermal barrier to movement between the lakes in July and August, and that it may be necessary to block lake trout movements between the two lakes at other times to effectively control the population in Upper Priest Lake.																			0275-5947					MAY	2005	25	2					635	639		10.1577/M04-025.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M04-025.1													WOS:000229839000023

The Adirondack Long-Term Monitoring (ALTM) program was established in 1982 to evaluate changes in the chemistry of 17 Adirondack lakes. The ALTM lakes exhibited relatively uniform concentrations of SO42-. Lake-to-lake variability in acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) was largely due to differences in the supply of basic cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+; CB) to drainage waters. Lakes in the western and southern Adirondacks showed elevated concentrations of NO3-, while lakes in the central and eastern Adirondacks had lower NO3- Concentrations during both peak and base flow periods. The ALTM lakes exhibited seasonal variations in ANC. Lake ANC was maximum during the late summer or autumn, and lowest during spring snowmelt. In general Adirondack lakes with ANC near 100 mueq L-1 during base flow periods may experience decreases in ANC to near or below 0 mueq L-1 during high flow periods. The ALTM lakes have exhibited long-term temporal trends in water chemistry. Most lakes have demonstrated declining SO42-, consistent with decreases in SO, emissions and SO42-in precipitation in the eastern U.S. Reductions in SO42- have not coincided with a recovery in ANC. Rather, ANC values have declined in some ALTM lakes. This pattern is most likely due to increasing concentrations of NO3- that occurred in most of the ALTM drainage lakes.

Qualitative changes in Lake Biwa and Lake Tankai FAs were determined and compared. Although the relative molecular weights determined by high-performance size-exclusion chromatography did not change remarkably, the elemental compositions, E-600(1%) values and H-1- and C-13-NMR spectral properties varied with the season. Both the H/C and N/C ratios for Lake Biwa FAs tended to be higher than those for Lake Tankai FAs, but O/C ratios were lower and decreased from spring to winter. The E-600(1%) values suggested that Lake Biwa FAs contained lower levels of unsaturated structures than Lake Tankai FAs, and the amounts of these structures increased in winter. The H-1 and C-13 NMR spectra indicated that Lake Biwa FAs are richer in saturated aliphatic chains, especially in spring. Overall, Lake Biwa FAs exhibited clearer seasonal changes in these characteristics than Lake Tankai FAs, suggesting that the seasonal variation may depend on changes in aquatic microbial activities.

Large numbers of ducks feed on these mussels in autumn and winter. The mussels are filter feeders and are exposed to high densities of cyanobacteria in summer and autumn. Mussels and cyanobacteria both thrive in Lake IJsselmeer. Apparently the mussels are somehow protected against accumulation of harmful quantities of cyanobacterial toxins. In this study, we investigated the assimilation of the cyanobacterial toxin microcystin-LR (MC-LR) in zebra mussels when fed the toxic cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa as sole food or in a mixture with the eustigmatophyte Nannochloropsis limnetica. After 3 weeks of assimilation we studied the deputation of MC-LR during 3 weeks when the food of the mussels was free of cyanobacteria. These assimilation/depuration experiments were combined with grazing experiments, using the same food treatments. Microcystins were analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS); in addition, covalently bound MC were analyzed using the MMPB method. The mussels showed higher clearance rates on Microcystis than on Nannochloropsis. No selective rejection of either phytoplankton species was observed in the excretion products of the mussels. Zebra mussels fed Microcystis as single food, assimilated microcystin-LR relatively fast, and after I week the maximum value of free unbound microcystin assimilation (ca. 11 mug g DW-1) was attained. For mussels, fed with the mixed food, a maximum of only 3.9 mug g DW-1 was recorded after 3 weeks. Covalently bound MC never reached high values, with a maximum of 62% of free MC in the 2nd week of the experiment. In the depuration period microcystin decreased rapidly to low values and after 3 weeks only very low amounts of microcystin were detectable.

These bacteria are used in microbial source tracking (MST) studies. Ideally, all strains of a given indicator organism (IO) would experience equal persistence (maintenance of culturable populations) in water; however, some strains may have comparatively extended persistence outside the host, while others may persist very poorly in environmental waters. In our study, we recorded the highest density of fecal bacteria in winter, and the lowest in spring and summer. They are also more in deep regions rather than on the surface, which might be due to the Inhibitory effects of solar radiation, which has been shown to influence the survival of these organisms. The concentrations of fecal bacteria were not only a result of temporal or spatial variability in their sources, but also the fact that various bacteria have different lifespans that vary according to environmental factors, such as temperature, pH, concentration in nutrients, and solar radiation which is responsible for 99% of the mortality of fecal coliforms on the surface.

Multiple antibiotic resistance of heterotrophic bacteria in the littoral zone of Lake Shira as an indicator of human impact on the ecosystem	MICROBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Resistance to Ampicillin and Kanamycin displayed by heterotrophic bacteria isolated in Summer and in Spring from the littoral and the central parts of Lake Shira (a therapeutic take in the Khakasia Republic, Russia) has been investigated. It has been found that in Summer, human and animal microflora featuring multiple antibiotic resistance (to Ampicillin and Kanamycin) predominates in all the studied stations of the littoral zone of the take. In Spring, concentrations of bacteria featuring multiple antibiotic resistance decrease significantly and bacteria sensitive to antibiotics predominate in the take. Emergence of multiple antibiotic resistance in bacteria of Lake Shira is caused by the input of allochthonous bacteria into the take; this feature of heterotrophic bacteria of Lake Shira can be used to monitor the impact on the ecosystem made by health resorts.

J	KOHLER, J				KOHLER, J			ORIGIN AND SUCCESSION OF PHYTOPLANKTON IN A RIVER-LAKE SYSTEM (SPREE, GERMANY)	HYDROBIOLOGIA					9th Workshop of the International-Association-for-Phytoplankton-Taxonomy-and-Ecology	JUL 10-18, 1993	MONT RIGI, BELGIUM	INT ASSOC PHYTOPLANKTON TAXON & ECOL				The River Spree (Germany) flows through an impoundment and several shallow lakes in its middle and lower course. In this river-lake system, the seasonal and longitudinal dynamics of dominant phytoplankton populations were studied in relation to retention time of water, mixing conditions and nutrient supply from 1988-92. Some phytoplankton species populated the same river section for weeks or months each year at their season. Such stable populations have to origin from river zones functioning like mixed reactors. In the Spree system, centric diatoms originated from an impoundment and filamentous cyanobacteria from a flushed lake with longer retention time of water. Downstream, biomass and composition of phytoplankton altered nearly simultaneously along the system. The fate of planktonic organisms washed from mixed reactors into the flow depended on the conditions at the zones of origin. During spring, populations dominating phytoplankton communities of the well-mixed lakes grew further under river conditions. However the biomass of summer species, adapted to intermittent stratification, was halved along the river course. These seasonal differences were probably caused by lower maximum growth rates of summer species and enhanced losses (photorespiration, sedimentation or grazing of benthic filter feeders, but not of zooplankton) of algal populations under river conditions in summer. Phytoplankton assimilation, settlement of diatoms, or denitrification caused declining (probably growth limiting) concentrations of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (spring), silicon (early summer) or nitrogen (summer) along the river course, respectively. The minimum content of DRP was often followed by a clear-water phase. Reduced DSi supply selected against diatoms and additional DIN shortage favoured N-2-fixing cyanobacteria in the last lake of the system. R-strategists (sensu Reynolds) were selected in both the flushed, shallow lakes and the lowland river. In general, the biomass of cyanobacteria increased within the lakes and declined along the river course. Some diatom populations grew in the river, but were grazed or settled down in the lakes. Beside this general picture, different populations from the same phylogenetic group did not necessarily perform in similar ways.					; Köhler, Jan/C-2633-2014	Kohler, Jan/0000-0003-1894-2912; 													0018-8158					SEP 9	1994	289	1-3					73	83		10.1007/BF00007410	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007410													WOS:A1994PK72300008
J	Ries, RD; Perry, SA				Ries, RD; Perry, SA			Potential effects of global climate warming on brook trout growth and prey consumption in central Appalachian streams, USA	CLIMATE RESEARCH												The effects of global warming trends on growth and food consumption rates for a brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis population were simulated with a bioenergetics model. We examined the hypothesis that improved growth conditions during cooler months will offset the opposing effects of extreme temperatures during the summer. Annual growth increments of brook trout were determined from a population in a high elevation stream in West Virginia, USA, and baseline stream temperatures were measured in mid to high elevation streams. The mean annual stream temperature was increased by 2 and 4 degrees C to simulate the effects of climatic warming. Brook trout populations at high elevations in the Appalachian Mountains could either benefit from increased growth rates in spring and fall, or suffer from shrinking habitat and reduced growth rates in summer, depending on the magnitude of temperature change and on food availability. An increase of 2 degrees C or less could very likely increase brook trout growth, but the effect of larger temperature increases is less predictable due to greater dependence on higher prey production. A 15 to 20% increase in food consumption would be required to maintain present rates of growth with an increase of 2 degrees C, and 30 to 40% more food would be required with an increase of 4 degrees C.																			0936-577X					DEC 7	1995	5	3					197	206		10.3354/cr005197	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/cr005197													WOS:A1995TV24700002

Production was measured in an area receiving thermal effluent and at a control site, unaffected by thermal effluent. A greater standing crop existed in winter in the thermal mixing zone. E. canadensis which had no marked dormancy mechanism, was dominant in this zone in winter. Higher light levels, due to the absence of ice cover, resulted in earlier spring growth in the effluent zone, but early spring productivity was limited by low water temperatures, caused by strong thermal stratification. Elodea dominated early spring production because of the large standing crop overwinter. After turnover, the growth of E. canadensis increased and vegetative and potential sexual reproduction increased compared to the control site. Elodea comprised only approximately 1/3 of the maximum standing crop at the control site in the 1st yr, and was absent the 2nd yr. Large standing crops of Elodea near the surface were thinned by wave action. The resulting stem fragments were spread throughout the lake, where they established during the growing season but later declined. Following this process of thinning, a 2nd peak in the standing crop was observed. Changes in the species composition of submerged macrophytes in heated areas of Lake Wabamun do not seem to have spread to unheated areas of the lake.																			0021-8901	1365-2664					1977	14	3					835	851		10.2307/2402815	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2402815													WOS:A1977EG00500014

Two different amplifications were performed. one specific for the domain Bacteria (Escherichia coli positions 8-536) and another specific for the family Chromatiaceae (E. coli positions 8-1005). The latter was followed by semi-nested reamplification with the bacterial primer set, allowing comparison of the two PCR approaches by TTGE. The TTGE patterns of samples from the chemocline and the anoxic monimolimnion were essentially identical, whereas the oxic mixolimnion displayed distinctively different banding patterns. For samples from the chemocline and the monimolimnion. dominant bands in the Bacteria-specific TTGE profiles comigrated with bands obtained by the semi-nested PCR approach specific for Chromatiaceae. This observation suggested that Chromatiaceae are in high abundance in the anoxic water layer. All dominant bands were excised and sequenced. Changes in the community structure, as indicated by changes in the TTGE profiles. were observed in samples taken at different times of the year. In the chemocline, Chromatium okenii was dominant in the summer months, whereas Amoebobacter purpureus populations dominated in autumn and winter. This change was confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization.

To fill this knowledge gap, the biological pump effects of phytoplankton on the fate of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in sediments and benthos (Corbicula fluminea) from Lake Taihu, a hypereutrophic lake in China, were identified. The spatial-temporal distribution of HOCs suggests that higher phytoplankton biomass, coupled with sediment organic matter (SOM) content, greatly increased the concentration of HOCs in sediments in both winter and summer seasons. This could be attributed to the biological pump effects sequestering more HOCs from water to sediments with settling phytoplankton, especially during the summer. The biological pump effects further promoted the uptake of sediment-bound HOCs by benthos. The significant positive relationships between concentrations of HOCs in sediments and benthos were observed during the winter dormancy phase of benthos. Furthermore, the benthic bioaccumulation of HOCs could be strengthened by phytoplankton, due to their contribution to SOM and the following increased bioavailability of HOCs in sediments. Further research is needed to elucidate the phytoplankton biological pump effects on the fate of HOCs in benthic food chain, especially for hypereutrophic waters.

Seasonal Changes of Freshwater Ammonia-Oxidizing Archaeal Assemblages and Nitrogen Species in Oligotrophic Alpine Lakes	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The annual changes in the composition and abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) were analyzed monthly in surface waters of three high mountain lakes within the Limnological Observatory of the Pyrenees (LOOP; northeast Spain) using both 16S rRNA and functional (ammonia monooxygenase gene, amoA) gene sequencing as well as quantitative PCR amplification. The set of biological data was related to changes in nitrogen species and to other relevant environmental variables. The whole archaeal assemblage was dominated by phylotypes closely related to the crenarchaeal 1.1a group (58% +/- 18% of total 16S rRNA gene sequences), and consistent structural changes were detected during the study. Water temperature was the environmental variable that better explained spring, summer, and winter (ice-covered lakes) archaeal assemblage structure. The amoA gene was detected year round, and seasonal changes in amoA gene composition were well correlated with changes in the archaeal 16S rRNA gene pool. In addition, copy numbers of both the specific 1.1a group 16 rRNA and archaeal amoA genes were well correlated, suggesting that most freshwater 1.1a Crenarchaeota had the potential to carry out ammonia oxidation. Seasonal changes in the diversity and abundance of AOA (i.e., amoA) were better explained by temporal changes in ammonium, the substrate for nitrification, and mostly nitrite, the product of ammonia oxidation. Lacustrine amoA gene sequences grouped in coherent freshwater phylogenetic clusters, suggesting that freshwater habitats harbor typical amoA-containing ecotypes, which is different from soils and seas. We observed within the freshwater amoA gene sequence pool a high genetic divergence (translating to up to 32% amino acid divergence) between the spring and the remaining AOA assemblages. This suggests that different AOA ecotypes are adapted to different temporal ecological niches in these lakes.

Reducing Impacts of Double-crested Cormorants to Natural Resources in Central New York: A Review of a Collaborative Research, Management, and Monitoring Program	WATERBIRDS												Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) have used central New York waters for breeding and stopover habitats during migration since 1984. In response to public concern over Oneida Lake, the United States Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation initiated an integrated research, management and monitoring program aimed at mitigating cormorant impacts to fisheries and other natural resources in 1998. The history of this program was reviewed and efforts to reduce negative impacts of the Double-crested Cormorant population in central New York described. Management was successful, as demonstrated by a substantial decrease in cormorant use of Oneida Lake during spring, summer and fall seasons, and the apparent recovery of certain sportfish populations. Research identified cormorant movement patterns within and among water bodies and documented cormorant responses to hazing and other management techniques. The cormorant management program in central New York was intended to keep cormorant use of Oneida Lake at a level that prevents unsustainable impacts to fisheries populations.

J	Hart, RC				Hart, RC			Cladoceran periodicity patterns in relation to selected environmental factors in two cascading warm-water reservoirs over a decade	HYDROBIOLOGIA					6th International Symposium on Cladocera	AUG 19-23, 2002	Wierzba, POLAND					Temporal changes in occurrence, population density and reproductive intensity (% of breeding individuals, clutch size) of species of the planktonic cladoceran assemblage in two adjacent, cascading, warm, monomictic reservoirs were studied over roughly 10 years. Findings are explored in relation to seasonal changes and inter-annual variability in water temperature (and stratification intensity), water transparency, water level, chlorophyll content and presence and abundance of other species in the assemblage as determinants or modifiers of species periodicity. Most of the numerically significant taxa present (4 in upstream Midmar, 7 in downstream Albert Falls) showed repeated patterns of periodicity. Large daphniids (Daphnia pulex and longispina) were virtually perennial occupants, except during conditions of elevated suspended sediment associated with fresh river in flows during floods, or sediment re-suspension at annual turnover and/or low water levels during drought phases of the hydrological cycle. Most other taxa (D. laevis, Diaphanosoma excisum, Ceriodaphnia reticulata, and Moina micrura) were essentially summer species, although some temporal separation was reflected in intra-seasonal, and between-lake differences in their occurrence. D. laevis occurred during early and/or late summer. C. reticulata was confined to late summer; significant densities arose in Midmar only in the final years of study, when it effectively replaced D. laevis. Diaphanosoma was a protracted summer occupant, with a more extended (and bimodal) presence in the warmer waters of Albert Falls. Moina and Bosmina were restricted to Albert Falls, and contrasted in seasonal occurrence. Moina was restricted to the mid-summer period, while Bosmina showed the greatest temporal variation of all taxa, generally appearing during periods of physical disturbance. Mean instantaneous birth rates for the entire study period contrasted widely among taxa (0.09-0.35 day(-1)), but ranked concordantly with the seasonal categorisations given above-with highest and lowest rates among seasonally restricted and perennial taxa, respectively. Correlation analysis revealed overall that the abundance of most individual species related to water transparency (congruent to suspended sediment), chlorophyll content and temperature (in rank order), although correlations were generally stronger with temperature than with chlorophyll. Several correlates were directionally inconsistent (+ vs-) for given species between lakes. However, these correlates of species densities undoubtedly translate into influences on species composition, and hence 'patterns' of periodicity. Positive pair-wise associations (Jaccard Index) existed for many species, reflecting temporal congruencies related to their periodicity. Collectively, however, the species in each reservoir were negatively associated, indicating separation on some undetermined basis (competition?).																			0018-8158					SEP	2004	526	1			SI		99	117		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000041610.56021.63	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000041610.56021.63													WOS:000223915900011

The units analyzed were houses built by the Uro community using "totora" (bulrush reeds). The field study characterized the dwelling's thermal performance, determined body surface area and clothing insulation, assessed thermal sensation, preference, and acceptability, determined personal adjustment strategies, and calculated the neutral temperature. Seventy-eight valid surveys were collected in two periods (summer and winter). The results reveal that the dwelling's users are uncomfortable. The preference points to warmer and drier environments. The neutral temperature was 19.62 degrees C in summer and 21.98 degrees C in winter.

Water bodies studied include Lake Erhai, second largest lake in Yunnan, several large lakes and reservoirs, and numerous smaller water bodies, located at 1800-2000 m above sea level. The winter-spring fauna of the area included 34 species, most of them Palearctic or widely distributed species, with plus five predominantly Paleotropical taxa. Thirty-one species occurred in Lake Erhai, while species richness in other water bodies not exceeded 14 species. Only parthenogenetic females were found in the majority of species, suggesting that Dali area climate is mild enough to allow Palearctic species to overwinter as active populations.

Low rates of consumption by yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and cisco (Coregonus artedii) allowed populations of D. galeata to expand rapidly during spring, resulting in a distinct clear-water period that lasted from mid-May until early June. A subsequent decline in D. galeata abundance resulted from low food availability brought about by its exploitation of algal resources. Once populations of D. galeata were reduced, predation by perch and cisco was sufficient to keep populations of D. galeata at low densities during July and August in spite of more abundant algal food resources. Extreme seasonal variation in the degree to which planktivorous fish can regulate daphnid population dynamics may have allowed daphnids to persist in Lake Mendota during the past century in the presence of abundant zooplanktivores.

Succession processes in the anoxygenic phototrophic bacterial community in Lake Kislo-Sladkoe (Kandalaksha Bay, White Sea)	MICROBIOLOGY												The community of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria (APB) in the water column of Lake Kislo- Sladkoe (Kandalaksha Bay, White Sea), which has recently become separated from the sea, was investigated in March?April 2012, March?April 2013, and in September 2013. The lake, which was previously considered meromictic, was in fact mixed and was strongly affected by the sea. In winter the lake is sometimes washed off with seawater, and this together with the seasonal cycles of succession processes determines the succession of the community. The consequences of the mixing in autumn 2011 could be observed in the APB community as late as autumn 2013. Green-colored green sulfur bacteria (GSB) usually predominated in the chemocline. In winter 2013 stagnation resulted in turbidity of water under the ice, which was responsible for both predominance of the brown GSB forms and the changes ratio of the species of purple sulfur bacteria (PSB) in anoxic water layers. Production of anoxygenic photosynthesis in the lake was at least 240 mg C m(-2) day(-1) in September and 0-20 mg C m(-2) day(-1) in March-April, which corresponded to 40 and 69%, respectively, of oxygenic photosynthesis. Okenone-containing purple sulfur bacteria, strain TcakPS12, were isolated in 2012 from lake water. The ells of this strain form filaments of not separated cells. Strain TcakPS12 exhibited 98% similarity with the type strains of Thiocapsa pendens DSM 236 and Thiocapsa bogorovii BBS, as well as with the strains AmPS10 and TcyrPS10, which were isolated from Lake Kislo-Sladkoe in 2010.

Response of phytoplankton to an experimental fish culture in net cages in a subtropical reservoir	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												This study aimed to evaluate nutrients concentration and spatial-temporal changes in phytoplankton biovolume during an experimental fish culture in net cages in a lateral arm of Salto Caxias reservoir, Brazil. Two sampling stations were placed in the affected lateral arm and other two in a cageless lateral arm. Neither abiotic variables nor phytoplankton biovolume presented significant differences between the treatments. Only temporal changes were confirmed by the analysis performed. Both lateral arms were classified as oligotrophic, reflecting low influence of the net cages. Phytoplankton growth seems to be limited by nitrogen. Biovolume values were, in general, low and five major functional groups were recognized (E, F, G, K and P). In summer higher biovolume values were observed and representatives of Chlorophyceae and Cyanobacteria belonging to the functional groups F and K, respectively, were the most important. In winter phytoplankton was mainly composed by Bacillariophyceae taxa from P group. G group was also restricted to winter and E group occurred in winter and summer. The variations recorded in phytoplankton structure appear to have been mainly influenced by seasonal changes in temperature, precipitation and nutrients availability. The effects of net cages on the abiotic variables and phytoplankton biovolume appear to have been small, probably due to the small number of net cages employed and the system dilution capacity. However, a permanent monitoring of phytoplankton is recommended, since this environment has a carrying capacity, from which the trophic state may increase.					bueno, norma catarina/W-9524-2019; Bueno, Norma/W-9524-2019; Rodrigues, Luzia Cleide/B-7856-2017; Rodrigues, Luzia/B-7856-2017	bueno, norma catarina/0000-0001-6939-9222; Bartozek, Elaine/0000-0002-6454-3958; Rodrigues, Luzia Cleide/0000-0002-0593-0931; 													1519-6984	1678-4375				OCT-DEC	2016	76	4					824	833		10.1590/1519-6984.00115	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1519-6984.00115								27166569					WOS:000387656700003

Wind-driven upwelling and surface nutrient delivery in a semi-enclosed coastal sea	OCEAN SCIENCE												Wind-driven upwelling is an important control on surface nutrients and water properties in stratified lakes and seas. In this study, a high-resolution biophysical coupled model is used to investigate upwelling in the Strait of Georgia on the Canadian Pacific coast. The model is forced with surface winds from a high-resolution atmospheric forecast and has been tuned in previous studies to reproduce extensive observations of water level, temperature, salinity, nutrients and chlorophyll with competitive skill relative to similar models of the study region. A total of 5 years of hourly surface nitrate and temperature fields are analyzed in order to characterize the dominant upwelling patterns of the basin. A prevailing along-axis wind pattern steered by mountainous topography produces episodic upwelling along the western shore during the spring and fall southeasterlies and along the eastern shore during the summer northwesterlies, as indicated by positive nitrate anomalies. Principal component analysis reveals that these cross-axis upwelling patterns account for nearly one-third of the surface nitrate variance during the summer productive season. By contrast, nearly half of the surface temperature variance over the same period is dominated by a single, combined mixing and diurnal heating-cooling pattern. The principal components associated with these patterns correlate with along-axis wind stress in a manner consistent with these physical interpretations. The cross-axis upwelling response to wind is similar to other dynamically wide basins where the baroclinic Rossby deformation radius is smaller than the basin width. However, the nitrate anomaly during upwelling along the eastern shore is stronger in the northern basin, which may be indicative of an along-axis pycnocline tilt or an effect of the background along-axis stratification gradient due to the Fraser River. Our findings highlight an important spatiotemporal consideration for future ecosystem monitoring.																			1812-0784	1812-0792				JAN 31	2022	18	1					143	167		10.5194/os-18-143-2022	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/os-18-143-2022													WOS:000751429900001

An outbreak of Shewanella putrefaciens group in wild eels Anguilla anguilla L. favoured by hypoxic aquatic environments	JOURNAL OF FISH DISEASES												Microbiological analyses were conducted on wild eels from the L'Albufera Lake (Spain). A total of 174 individuals were collected in two surveys (i.e. year 2008 and autumn-winter 2014) among those caught by local fishermen into the lagoon. The prevalence of Shewanella putrefaciens group was 1.7% in 2008 and rose above 32% in 2014. It was due to an outbreak of shewanellosis that presented a morbidity rate of 64%. S. putrefaciens group strains were isolated as pure cultures from the sick eels that showed white ulcers surrounded by a reddish inflammation, damage of the mouth, extensive skin discoloration, exophthalmia, ascites and bad odour. The S. putrefaciens group was recovered from freshwater samples taken at the L'Albufera system, along autumn-winter 2015. Its counts significantly increased in freshwater parallel to hypoxia and temperature rising. Shewanellae strains were identified as S. putrefaciens and S. xiamenensis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. These isolates recovered from sick eels or freshwater were virulent for European eel by IP challenge (LD50 10 6 CFU g(-1) body weight). They also caused 30-38% cumulative mortality, in European eels challenged by a 2-h bath (10 7 CFU mL(-1)). These results suggest that shewanellosis could be transmitted through water highlighting the fact that hypoxic conditions increase this bacterium levels in water.

However, in the case of Southeastern Tibet Plateau (SETP), the availability of optical images in high mountain areas is low, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) amplitude images have significant geometric distortions. Most GL extraction studies are mainly focused on autumn and winter seasons. In order to obtain accurate GL boundaries at any time and to capture seasonal changes of GLs in a wide area, this letter proposes a high mountain GL extraction framework based on the coupling of Google Earth Engine (GEE) and historical GL catalog data, which focuses on local GL extraction problems. GL extraction and validation were performed using various clustering and adaptive threshold segmentation methods, all of which showed strong stability and reliability of the proposed scheme. Finally, we employed a superpixel clustering algorithm to estimate the area of GLs as of August 1, 2019, and then compared the results with two widely used spatially referenced datasets. The results indicate that our method achieves a comprehensive intersection over union (IoU) of up to 95%. The proposed method can effectively support the extraction of wide-area summer GLs and the monitoring of seasonal changes in GL area, thus enabling the dynamic updating of GL information at a high temporal frequency.

J	King, DT; Werner, SJ				King, DT; Werner, SJ			Daily activity budgets and population size of American White Pelicans wintering in south Louisiana and the delta region of Mississippi	WATERBIRDS												Twenty-one American White Pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) were captured and fitted with radiotransmitters in south Louisiana and the delta region of Mississippi during the winter and early spring of 1994-1997. The pelicans were monitored to determine their daily activity budgets while using different habitats such as catfish ponds, crawfish ponds, rivers. lakes, and bayous. Pelicans foraging at catfish ponds spent about 4% of their day foraging and 96% loafing, while pelicans foraging in other habitats spent about 28% of their day foraging and 72% loafing. Fur all individual bird, the mean number of foraging sessions per day was 2.5 (+/-0.53 SE) and the mean length of each foraging session was 66.7 min. (+/-8.08 SE). Aerial censuses were also conducted to determine the numbers of pelicans in the delta region of Mississippi. Each rear the numbers of pelicans wintering in the delta region of Mississippi peaked in February and March, corresponding with spring migration. Pelican numbers reached approximately 4,600 during February and March 1996. Pelicans were observed foraging in larger flocks for shorter periods of time on catfish ponds than in other habitats.																			1524-4695					AUG	2001	24	2					250	254		10.2307/1522038	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1522038													WOS:000170229400015

An invasive predator affects habitat use by native prey: American mink and water vole co-existence in riparian habitats	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												This study examines the occurrence of invasive American mink Neovison vison and native water voles Arvicola amphibius along the shorelines of eutrophic lakes and at small midfield ponds in the Mazurian Lakeland, north-east (NE) Poland. The main hypothesis tested in this study is that built-up areas and small midfield ponds are avoided by mink; therefore, they can serve as refuges that protect water voles from mink predation. Floating rafts were used to monitor mink and water vole distribution. Mink presence was negatively associated with urbanization at lake shorelines and midfield ponds, and these two characteristics positively correlated with occurrence of water voles in the study area. The probability of occurrence of water voles was significantly lower at sites where mink occurred. The occupancy rates for mink at lakes and at midfield ponds were higher in autumn than in spring and conversely the occupancy rates for water voles were higher in spring and lower in autumn. Our study shows that within a postglacial landscape, urban areas and midfield ponds distant from lakes are avoided by the American mink and thus these areas may function as refuge habitats for water voles and may maintain populations of this rodent at the landscape scale despite the presence of mink.					; Żmihorski, Michał/IUM-9401-2023; Zalewski, Andrzej/K-7271-2012	Zmihorski, Michal/0000-0001-5137-1635; Zalewski, Andrzej/0000-0003-4518-2787; Brzezinski, Marcin/0000-0002-6300-0425; , Michal/0000-0002-2951-3462; 													0952-8369	1469-7998				FEB	2018	304	2					109	116		10.1111/jzo.12500	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jzo.12500													WOS:000423821900004
J	Badmaeva, EN				Badmaeva, Ekaterina N.			The Problem of Water Supply in the Nomadic Way of Management (On the Example of Kalmyk Steppe in the Late 19th - Early 20th Centuries)	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL												Based on the analysis of documentary materials from the funds of the National Archive of the Republic of Kalmykia, the problem of water use and water supply in terms of a nomadic way of management is first examined on the example of the Kalmyk steppe in the late 19th - early 20th centuries. The problem of water use and water supply in history has been urgent for nomads, including Kalmyk cattle breeders. For a long time, Kalmykia belonged to the driest area in the south of Russia, and the problem of water supply was always relevant for it. The use of water resources was particularly specific for steppe pastoralists. As is well known, all their life activity in the semi-desert and desert Kalmyk steppes was inscribed in the system of surface sources of fresh water, on the one hand. On the other hand, their entire life process in the summer took place near dug hoods (well-shaped pits) and artesian wells. Kalmykia, both in the natural climatic and economic terms, had its own dissimilarity, which distinguished it from all other provinces of the Russian Empire. In the area, the average annual air temperature is up to +10 degrees C, the frost-free period is long (on average, 170-180 days a year), and rain in the summer period is scarce (average rainfall is from 180 to 350 mm). The main feature of the climate in the area is its sharp continentality: hot and dry summers with frequent droughts and dry winds, long dry autumns, cold winters with thaws and little snow, and, finally, short springs. These characteristic features of the natural environment, the harsh natural conditions, had a direct impact on the formation of Kalmyk nomads' attentive and reverent attitude to natural resources. The Kalmyks have a centuries-old appreciative attitude to nature, especially to water resources. Living in harsh climatic conditions, the nomads thoroughly guarded their steppe, and, rationally and carefully using their water sources, they sometimes did not allow other khotons to use drinking water from their well (khuduk). In the course of the study, the author classified the water sources of the Kalmyk steppe and made mathematical calculations on the water supply of livestock in the Kalmyk farms of Maloderbetovsky Ulus without taking into account natural reservoirs (lakes, ponds, estuaries, dams). The author proved that the authorities actively supported the initiative of the Kalmyk nomads who sought to reconstruct the old and develop new water bodies on their own. Based on specific material, the author illustrated attempts to solve the problem of water supply by the authorities and the forces of initiative nomadic population in the Kalmyk steppe, one of the most arid regions of the Russian Empire. In general, the author characterized the policy of the imperial authorities in this aspect as half measures.

Seasonal changes in water thermal stratification and turbulence strongly influence the concentration and emission of dissolved GHGs in water columns. Here, we studied the stratification and overturn processes of water column in the subtropical Lianhe Reservoir during different seasons and determined the dynamics of dissolved CO2, CH4, and N2O in the reservoir. Observation of temperature and analysis of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) clearly suggested that stratification of water column occurred in summer, but not in winter. The results showed that while dissolved oxygen (DO) was high in the top 5-m layer (the upper epilimnion layer), it dropped considerably especially below 10 m, resulting in an increase in concentration of CO2 and CH4. The high concentrations of dissolved N2O and CH4 were related to the decomposition of organic matter in the hypolimnion layer under anaerobic conditions after stratification. In winter overturn period, vertical circulants of water not only homogenized the concentration of DO in the water column, but also potentially moved CO2, CH4, and N2O from the bottom to the surface of the reservoir. The estimated GHG flux from the reservoir was - 7.13 mmol m(-2) day(-1) in summer and 2.14 mmol m(-2) day(-1) in winter. There was the potential that CO2 fluxes from subtropical lakes and reservoirs are overestimated by traditional geochemical models.					xing, li/HHN-4346-2022; Yang, Zhenglun/ADT-1217-2022	Yang, Zhenglun/0000-0002-3254-1288													0167-6369	1573-2959				OCT	2019	191	10							639	10.1007/s10661-019-7772-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-019-7772-x								31529378					WOS:000486151300002
J	Tarnay, L; Gertler, AW; Blank, RR; Taylor, GE				Tarnay, L; Gertler, AW; Blank, RR; Taylor, GE			Preliminary measurements of summer nitric acid and ammonia concentrations in the Lake Tahoe Basin air-shed: implications for dry deposition of atmospheric nitrogen	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Over the past 50 years, Lake Tahoe, an alpine lake located in the Sierra Nevada mountains on the border between California and Nevada, has seen a decline in water clarity. With significant urbanization within its borders and major urban areas 130 km upwind of the prevailing synoptic airflow, it is believed the Lake Tahoe Basin is receiving substantial nitrogen (N) input via atmospheric deposition during summer and fall. We present preliminary inferential flux estimates to both lake surface and forest canopy based on empirical measurements of ambient nitric acid (HNO3), ammonia (NH3), and ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) concentrations, in an effort to identify the major contributors to and ranges of atmospheric dry N deposition to the Lake Tahoe Basin. Total flux from dry deposition ranges from 1.2 to 8.6 kg N ha(-1) for the summer and fall dry season and is significantly higher than wet deposition, which ranges from 1.7 to 2.9 kg N ha(-1) year(-1). These preliminary results suggest that dry deposition of HNO3 is the major source of atmospheric N deposition for the Lake Tahoe Basin, and that overall N deposition is similar in magnitude to deposition reported for sites exposed to moderate N pollution in the southern California mountains.

J	Newman, CE; Richardson, MI; Lian, Y; Lee, C				Newman, Claire E.; Richardson, Mark I.; Lian, Yuan; Lee, Christopher			Simulating Titan's methane cycle with the TitanWRF General Circulation Model	ICARUS												Observations provide increasing evidence of a methane hydrological cycle on Titan. Earth-based and Cassini-based monitoring has produced data on the seasonal variation in cloud activity and location, with clouds being observed at increasingly low latitudes as Titan moved out of southern summer. Lakes are observed at high latitudes, with far larger lakes and greater areal coverage in the northern hemisphere, where some shorelines extend down as far as 50 degrees N. Rainfall at some point in the past is suggested by the pattern of flow features on the surface at the Huygens landing site, while recent rainfall is suggested by surface change. As with the water cycle on Earth, the methane cycle on Titan is both impacted by tropospheric dynamics and likely able to impact this circulation via feedbacks. Here we use the 3D TitanWRF General Circulation Model (GCM) to simulate Titan's methane cycle. In this initial work we use a simple large-scale condensation scheme with latent heat feedbacks and a finite surface reservoir of methane, and focus on large-scale dynamical interactions between the atmospheric circulation and methane, and how these impact seasonal changes and the long term (steady state) behavior of the methane cycle. We note five major conclusions: (1) Condensation and precipitation in the model is sporadic in nature, with interannual variability in its timing and location, but tends to occur in association with both (a) frequent strong polar upwelling during spring and summer in each hemisphere, and (b) the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), a region of increased convergence and upwelling due to the seasonally shifting Hadley cells. (2) An active tropospheric methane cycle affects the stratospheric circulation, slightly weakening the stratospheric superrotation produced. (3) Latent heating feedback strongly influences surface and near-surface temperatures, narrowing the latitudinal range of the ITCZ, and changing the distribution - and generally weakening the strength - of upwelling events. (4) TitanWRF favors low latitude 'cloudiness' around northern spring equinox as the ITCZ moves from south to north across the equator, versus the opposite time of year. (5) TitanWRF produces drying of low and mid latitudes with net transport of surface methane to high latitudes, and shows persistent hemispheric asymmetry in the methane cycle such that the favored pole for surface methane is the one with winter occurring closest to perihelion.

To fully understand the dynamics of methane emissions in reservoirs, it is essential to grasp the temporal and vertical distribution patterns, as well as the factors that influence the methanogenic bacterial communities within the sediments. This study investigates the methane dynamics, carbon isotope fractionation (delta(CH4)-C-13), and abundance of functional microorganisms along the geochemical gradient in the in situ sedimentary column of Hongfeng Reservoir (China). Notably, the methane concentration in sediment in summer ranged in 15.39-127.22 mu mol/L, which is twice as high as wintertime concentrations in the surface layer near the sediment-water interface (0-10 cm depth). Illumina sequencing of the sediments identified 11 genera affiliated with methanogenic archaea, with dominant genus Methanosaeta reaching a relative abundance of 34.95% in summer. The total carbon (TOC) content in sedimentary columns in different seasons is positively correlated with Methanosarcina (P < 0.05). In addition, seasonal discrepancies are observed in the sediment profiles for total nitrogen (TN), sulfate (SO42-), and ferrous iron (Fe2+) concentrations. The concentration of total nitrogen (TN) is higher in summer than in winter. In summer, sulfate accumulates in the middle layer of the sedimentary column, while in winter, the maximum concentration of sulfate in the surface layer reaches 0.65 mmol/L. These geochemical gradients drive the biological transformation of nitrogen, sulfur, and iron, may also be linked to the consumption of methane. Thus, it is established that the temporal and spatial dynamics of methanogenic communities in sediments significantly influence the fluctuations in methane release fluxes within reservoirs, highlighting the necessity to account for seasonal biological variations when assessing greenhouse gas emissions from reservoirs.																			0343-8651	1432-0991				JAN	2025	82	1							55	10.1007/s00284-024-04038-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-024-04038-4								39715842					WOS:001382947000002
J	EDMONDSON, WT; LITT, AH				EDMONDSON, WT; LITT, AH			DAPHNIA IN LAKE WASHINGTON	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												In 1976, Daphnia, a genus that had been inconspiduous in the zooplankton of Lake Washington, suddenly became dominant. The mean summer transparency of the lake doubled. The major change affecting the success of Daphnia evidently was a decrease in the abundance of the predatory Neomysis mercedis in the mid-1960s. Daphnia probably did not increase at that time because of the continued persistence of significant quantities of Oscillatoria until 1975. Eight Daphnia spp. were seen in the lake, but only 3 are abundant. D. pulicaria was continuously present after its appearance in May, 1976 although it became very scarce in winter. D. galeata mendotae and D. thorata had much more limited occurrence. In eacy year from 1976 to 1980, 2 spp. formed separate population maxima, except in fall 1979 when D. thorata, although present, failed to increase. Instead, the plankton became dominated by the rotifer Conochilus hippocrepis which had been increasing for several years. In 1980, D. thorata and D. pulicaria made maxima, but in reverse order from earlier years. Several other species of zooplankton were less abundant after the resurgence of Daphnia than during the period of eutrophication and recovery.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1982	27	2					272	293		10.4319/lo.1982.27.2.0272	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1982.27.2.0272													WOS:A1982NJ03300009

Numbers and total biomass of phytoplankton slightly increase in successive years. Nannoplankton dominated in total numbers (> 50%), its contribution to biomass did not exceed 30% with the exception of spring in 1971. As regards numbers, nanoplanktonic species of groups Cryptophyceae and Chlorococcales dominated; as regards biomass, microplanktonic Cyanophyta dominated. Qualitative and quantitative changes of phytoplankton pointed to processes characteristic for eutrophication.																			0070-9557						1980	28	2					231	243																WOS:A1980LC09300005
J	Laumann, T; Nesje, A				Laumann, Tron; Nesje, Atle			Sporteggbreen, western Norway, in the past, present and future: Simulations with a two-dimensional dynamical glacier model	HOLOCENE												A two-dimensional shallow ice-flow model, yielding the glacier geometry at selected time intervals, is used to simulate the development of Sporteggbreen (1) from 8000 cal. yr BP to the present, (2) from AD 2011 to 2050, and (3) extending forward in time to AD 2100 and 2200. Glacier-surface geometry, subglacial topography, mass-balance data, internal deformation, and subglacial sliding are used as input data for the model runs. To force the model from 8000 cal. yr BP to the present, a mass-balance series based on the equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) variations on Jostedalsbreen to the west of Sporteggbreen is applied. A 50% reduction of the ELA amplitude at Jostedalsbreen is used to construct a new mass-balance series, and it was found that this gives a reasonably good coherence between the modelled and the real glacier. The modelled time series for ELA and length changes indicate that the glacier melted away c. 7300 cal. yr BP and was absent for c. 1700 years. It reformed c. 5400 cal. yr BP because of a modest lowering of the ELA and continued to grow in areal extent after c. 4000 cal. yr BP, apart from a small retreat episode c. AD 500. Simulations of the extent and geometry of Sporteggbreen in the future are carried out using different climate scenarios, involving summer temperature and winter precipitation. The model simulation from AD 2011 to 2050 gives relatively minor changes for glacier-surface profiles and glacier-surface geometry, mainly because of the short duration of the model run and because the increase of 12% in winter precipitation compensates for about 25% of the temperature increase of 1.3 degrees C. The simulations from AD 2011 to 2100, and further extended to AD 2200, show, however, significant changes in the glacier volume. This is reasonable because a summer temperature rise of 2.3 degrees C, which is used in this simulation, must be compensated for by an increase in winter precipitation of about 70% to maintain equilibrium.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				JUL	2014	24	7					842	852		10.1177/0959683614530446	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683614530446													WOS:000337561400008

Total content as well as inorganic species of the studied metalloids were considered. Shallow Lake Jaroslawieckie (Wielkopolski National Park) was chosen for the study reported. Water samples were collected in different macrophyte communities of the phytolittoral and in the middle of the lake in early spring and mid-summer 2002. Total concentrations of all studied metalloids in samples collected in summer were lower than in those collected in spring but not all studied mineral species of As, Sb and Se followed the same pattern of changes. Despite seasonal changeability the lack of significant spatial differentiation in the concentrations of the elements studied at the peak of the vegetation season, in particular no differences in their concentrations between the sites in the bulk water in the middle of the lake and the sites in the plant communities was stated. This finding might testify to the fact that the effect of vegetation on the concentration of the elements studied is limited.

Investigations were performed in summer 2010. Samples were collected every seven days for eight weeks. Physical and chemical characteristics of water, temperature, oxygen saturation, dissolved oxygen, electric conductivity and nutrients as well as flow velocity at sample site, were measured simultaneously with each sampling. Physical and chemical characteristics showed low temperature oscillations, good aeration and oligotrophic conditions. In general, greater diatom diversity was noted on natural substrate. A total of 104 diatom species were found on natural substrate and 82 on glass slides. The best represented genera on both types of substrate were Gomphonema and Navicula (each with eight species), Nitzschia (with six species), and Cocconeis (with five species). Achnanthidium exiguum, Achnanthidium minutissimum, Amphora pediculus, Cymbopleura amphicephala and Surirella minuta were recorded in all samples of natural substrate and Gomphonema minutum in artificial substrate samples.					; Borojević, Koraljka/C-7713-2013	Dedic, Anita/0000-0003-2032-9922; 													0365-0588	1847-8476				NOV	2015	74	2					393	406		10.1515/botcro-2015-0029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/botcro-2015-0029													WOS:000364817700014
J	Wu, L; Feng, WS				Wu, Li; Feng, Weisong			Temporal heterogeneity of plankton community in Lake Dianchi and its relation to environmental factors	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												The plankton community in Fubao Bay of Lake Dianchi, a large, shallow and highly polluted freshwater lake in China, was investigated on three dates. First, a total of 76 zooplankton species were identified by morphological characteristics of which 44 were protozoa, 20 rotifer, and 12 crustacean. Then, the plankton community was characterized by using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and Polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) over the time period. Morphological composition, RAPD fingerprints, PCR-DGGE fingerprints, and unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages clustering analysis all showed that samples within a season were generally clustered into the same group. The results also revealed that RAPD fingerprints and PCR-DGGE fingerprints were identical to morphological composition in characterizing community similarity. Canonical correspondence analysis based on morphological composition, RAPD fingerprints, and PCR-DGGE fingerprints all suggested that the factors strongly correlated with the first two ordination axes were seasonally different, further suggesting high- temporal heterogeneity in Lake Dianchi. There were close relationships between morphological composition, RAPD and PCR-DGGE fingerprints, and: (1) total nitrogen in summer, (2) total phosphorus in autumn, and (3) BOD5 or NO2-N in winter. Results of this study suggest that molecular techniques are acceptable methods for examining plankton community composition and measuring plankton community responses to stress and perturbation.

J	Offenberg, JH; Baker, JE				Offenberg, JH; Baker, JE			PCBs and PAHs in southern Lake Michigan in 1994 and 1995: Urban atmospheric influences and long-term declines	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Surface water samples were collected in southern Lake Michigan off Chicago, IL to determine if elevated levels of urban atmospheric pollutants influence concentrations of organic contaminants in nearshore surface waters. Water was sampled every 12 hours for 2 to 12 days during May 1994, July 1994, and January 1995 sampling intensives. total (dissolved + particulate; sum of 85 congeners) polychlorinated biphenyl (Sigma-PCB) concentrations ranged rom 80 pg/L (26 July 1994) to 350 pg/L (18 January 1995), while total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (Sigma(24)-PAH) concentration during the same period ranged from 7 ng/L (18 May 1994) to 19 ng/L (17 January 1995), PCB concentrations in surface waters were higher when winds were from the S/SW, suggesting that the rate of direct atmospheric deposition of urban PCBs to the surface water may be fast relative to aquatic horizontal mixing and removal mechanisms. Additionally PCB concentrations were higher during the winter than in the spring or summer, but PAH concentrations were not significantly different throughout the year. Lipid normalized PCB concentration sin zooplankton (> 202 mu m) appear to be higher during the winter (780 vs. 14,200 ng Sigma-PCBs/g-lipid; July vs. January), but PAH levels in zooplankton were invariant with season (21,000 vs. 21,200 ng Sigma-PAH/g lipid: July vs. January). The seasonal trend in surface water concentrations suggests relatively constant, elevated deposition or urban PAHs, throughout the year, but net PCB exchange that varies seasonally. In spite of these elevated atmospheric deposition fluxes, the concentration of Sigma-PCB in Lake Michigan surface waters has declined ten fold over the past 14 years. The resulting pseudo-first order loss rate constant for Lake Michigan is 0.17 +/- 0.3/yr (t(1/2) = 4.0 years), which closely matches those found for the atmosphere and biota of Lake Michigan.					; Offenberg, John/C-3787-2009; Baker, Joel/R-6159-2019; Baker, Joel/A-9685-2011	offenberg, john/0000-0002-0213-4024; Baker, Joel/0000-0002-9980-7781													0380-1330						2000	26	2					196	208		10.1016/S0380-1330(00)70686-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(00)70686-1													WOS:000087817600007

Monitoring it accurately through remote sensing is thus of great significance for early warnings of water eutrophication. Sentinel Multispectral Imager (MSI) images from May to September between 2020 and 2021 were used along with in-situ measurements to estimate Chl-a in Lake Chagan, which is located in Jilin Province, Northeast China. In this study, the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest (RF) models, which had similar performances, were generated by six single bands and six band combinations. The RF model was then selected based on the assessments (R-2 = 0.79, RMSE = 2.51 mu g L-1, MAPE = 9.86%), since its learning of the input features in the model conformed to the bio-optical properties of Case 2 waters. The study considered Chl-a concentrations in Lake Chagan as a seasonal pattern according to the K-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN) classification. The RF model also showed relatively stable performance for three seasons (spring, summer and autumn) and it was applied to map Chl-a in the whole lake. The research presents a more reliable machine learning (ML) model with higher precision than previous empirical models, as shown by the effects of the input features linked with the biological mechanisms of Chl-a. Its robustness was revealed by the temporal and spatial distributions of Chl-a concentrations, which were consistent with in-situ measurements in the map. This research was capable of revealing the current ecological situation in Lake Chagan and can serve as a reference in remote sensing of inland lakes.						tao, zui/0000-0002-8369-4452														2072-4292				OCT	2022	14	19							4924	10.3390/rs14194924	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14194924													WOS:000867309800001
J	Pu, XF; Cheng, QP				Pu, Xuefu; Cheng, Qingping			Unraveling the impacts of multiscale landscape patterns and socioeconomic development on water quality: A case study of the National Sustainable Development Agenda Innovation Demonstration Zone in Lincang City, Southwest China	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: National Sustainable Development Agenda Innovation Demonstration Zone in Lincang City, Southwest China Study focus: Revealing the current water quality status in rivers and reservoirs and its drivers is crucial to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). We assessed the spatial-temporal dynamics and influence of natural and socioeconomic factors on the water quality index (WQI) and water quality parameters of rivers and reservoirs using redundancy analysis (RDA) and the partial least squares path model (PLSPM). New hydrological insights for the region: The results indicate the following. (1) The annual average values of the WQI in Lincang City from 2018 to 2020 were 92.26, 92.06, and 92.45, respectively. The WQI values in spring, summer, autumn, and winter were 92.48, 90.38, 92.68, and 93.49, respectively. The annual and seasonal water quality levels were good or higher. However, spatial heterogeneity exists for some water quality parameters in Lincang City. (2) The influence of natural and socioeconomic factors on the WQI and water quality parameters is highly complex. The landscape composition, landscape configuration, and pollutant discharges are key factors affecting the water quality of rivers and reservoirs annually and seasonally, and a spatial scale dependence is observed. (3) Chemical and physical factors directly affect the WQI, particularly at small scales (100 m and 500 m buffer zones). Chemical factors have a strong inhibitory effect on the WQI of reservoirs (-0.79, -0.78) and rivers (-0.56, -0.72), whereas physical factors have a weak promoting effect (0.05-0.13). Landscape composition and landscape configuration and indirectly affect the WQI. In contrast, socioeconomic factors and pollution discharge indirectly impact the WQI of rivers and reservoirs through their influence on chemical and physical factors. These findings demonstrate that natural and social factors interact in multiple ways, impacting the water quality of rivers and reservoirs. This interaction depends on the spatial scale. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the appropriate distance from rivers and reservoirs in future land use planning, particularly in the landscape design and planning in Lincang City. Moreover, controlling wastewater discharge from industrial and agricultural activities and domestic water usage is vital for ensuring high water quality.

They appeared to exhibit greater diurnality, particularly during winter months, a greater degree of overland movement and more frequent use of non-earth refuge sites than do animals inhabiting mainland water bodies. Individuals foraged continuously for up to 16 h, with longer foraging bouts observed during the winter tracking period. Foraging range varied between 2 and 58 ha, with no significant differences observed between the sexes or seasons. All platypuses foraged predominantly in the lake; however, a number of animals were observed moving overland to and from waterbodies and burrows. Burrows were located on lake, creek and pool edges. A high percentage of burrows (25%) were located within dense sedge tussocks and scrub vegetation. Both the terrestrial activity and more opportunistic burrow-site selection may be related to reduced predation pressure in Tasmania.

J	Zhang, QA; Liu, Y; Yang, GD; Zhang, ZX				Zhang, Qiang; Liu, Ying; Yang, Guishan; Zhang, Zengxi			Precipitation and hydrological variations and related associations with large-scale circulation in the Poyang Lake basin, China	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Long streamflow series and precipitation data are analysed in this study with aim to investigate changing properties of precipitation and associated impacts on hydrological processes of the Poyang Lake basin. Underlying causes behind the precipitation variations are also explored based on the analysis of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) reanalysis data. Besides, water intrusion from the Yangtze River to the Poyang Lake basin is studied. The results indicate that (1) seasonal transitions of precipitation are observed, showing increasing precipitation in winter, slight increase and even decrease of precipitation in summer; (2) analysis of water vapour circulation indicates decreasing/increasing water vapour flux in summer/winter; in winter, water vapour flux tends to be from the Pacific. Altered water vapour flux is the major cause behind the altered precipitation changes across the Poyang Lake basin and (3) occurrence of water intrusion from the Yangtze River to the Poyang Lake basin is heavily influenced by hydrological processes of the Poyang Lake basin. Effects of the hydrological processes from the middle Yangtze River on the occurrence of water intrusion events are not significant. The results of this study indicate that floods and droughts should share the same concerns from the scholars and policy makers. Besides, the altered hydrological circulation and associated seasonal transition of precipitation drive us to face new challenges in terms of conservations of wetlands and ecological environment under the changing climate.

Alternative states in the phytoplankton of Lake Kinneret, Israel (Sea of Galilee)	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Through analyses of a 34-year record of phytoplankton, zooplankton and physicochemical parameters from Lake Kinneret, Israel, we show that distinct and persistent phytoplankton assemblage states occurred from winter to summer. 2. The most obvious characteristic of these states was the presence or absence of a spring bloom of the dinoflagellate, Peridinium gatunense. 3. Analyses of the data within the framework of the alternative states model revealed a possible complex triggering mechanism, and system hysteresis. 4. A change in zooplankton biomass and body size coincident with changes in predation pressure associated with the collapse of the Kinneret Bleak, Acanthobrama terraesanctae, fishery appeared to be the 'slow changing' variable in the context of the alternative states model. Alternative phytoplankton states were only possible after this variable crossed a threshold in 1993-94, following the collapse of the fishery. 5. When alternative states were possible, some physicochemical parameters and the structure of the zooplankton assemblage appeared to control which phytoplankton state emerged in a given year. In years without a P. gatunense bloom, important physicochemical parameters in winter included low NO3 loading, high water temperature, high water level, a deeper thermocline, low transparency, high concentrations of NO3 and Cl in the epilimnion, and low concentration of epilimnetic total phosphorus. In addition, the cladoceran Chydorus sphaericus and adults of the copepod Mesocyclops ogunnus were observed in winter in years without a bloom. 6. Zooplankton biomass and body size of some taxa have recovered since the 1993-94 collapse of the fishery, yet incidence of both phytoplankton states in Lake Kinneret was still possible. Within the framework of the alternative states model, this suggests that the slow changing variable threshold where alternative states became possible is different from the threshold where alternative states will no longer be possible. In other words, the system is characterised by a hysteresis.

To assess the biosorbent activity of Egeria densa, a submerged freshwater macrophyte, plants were collected monthly from a circular drainage area in Lake Biwa basin and the Mn concentrations of the plants were analysed. Mn concentrations in these plants were generally above those of terrestrial hyperaccumulators, and were markedly higher in spring and summer than in autumn. Mn concentrations were much lower in plants incubated in hydroponic medium at various pH levels with and without Mn supplementation than in field-collected plants. The precipitation of Mn oxides on the leaves was determined by variable pressure scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray analysis and Leucoberbelin blue staining. Several strains of epiphytic bacteria were isolated from the field-collected E. densa plants, with many of these strains, including those of the genera Acidovorax, Comamonas, Pseudomonas and Rhizobium, found to have Mn-oxidizing activity. High Mn concentrations in E. densa were mediated by the production of biogenic Mn oxide in biofilms on leaf surfaces. These findings provide new insights into plant epidermal bacterial flora that affect metal accumulation in plants and suggest that these aquatic plants may have use in Mn phytomining.					; Hasegawa, Hiroshi/C-4261-2015	Harada, Emiko/0000-0002-8479-8034; 													0140-7791	1365-3040				JUL	2017	40	7					1163	1173		10.1111/pce.12910	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pce.12910								28098343					WOS:000402737300014
S	Górniak, A		Korzeniewska, E; Harnisz, M		Gorniak, Andrzej			Total Organic Carbon in the Water of Polish Dam Reservoirs	POLISH RIVER BASINS AND LAKES: HYDROLOGY AND HYDROCHEMISTRY, PT I	Handbook of Environmental Chemistry Series											Total organic carbon (TOC) resources in Polish water reservoirs are presented as an important factor affecting water quality and ecosystem trophic state. The study is based on hydrochemical and biological data from 47 reservoirs from the years 2005-2017 and collected from the archives of the Polish National Monitoring Program, provided by the Chief Inspectorate of Environment Protection. The mean (by weight) TOC concentration in reservoirs is 6.3 mg dm(-3), with a range from 2.3 mg C dm(-3) in the mountains, the Czorsztyn and Sromowce reservoirs, up to 18 mg C dm(-3) in the hypereutrophic, lowland Siemianowka reservoir, varying according to reservoir elevation. Although reservoirs are large and deep, there is a significant negative correlation between mean reservoir depth and TOC. Seasonality and national TOC dynamics were strongly related to the rate of precipitation, with maximal concentrations in late spring and minimal in autumn or winter. The first global warming symptoms of TOC changes in reservoirs are noted, which will manifest as increased TOC and greenhouse gas emissions. Increased water retention time, which promotes water eutrophication, increases TOC resources in most Polish dam reservoirs as well as in flooded areas. Mean TOC concentrations are related to certain biological reservoir water parameters, such as phytoplankton index or diatom index. In future planning, Polish reservoirs should be placed outside lowlands, and their capacity should provide a high water exchange, in less than 2 to 3 months.																			1433-6863		978-3-030-12123-5; 978-3-030-12122-8				2020	86						189	207		10.1007/978-3-030-12123-5_10	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-12123-5_10	10.1007/978-3-030-12123-5												WOS:000487329500012

The breeding distribution of seals in winter, when the lake is frozen over, is fairly well known, whereas their movements and foraging behaviors have been relatively unstudied. With satellite-linked radio transmitters, we documented the movements and dive patterns of four juvenile Baikal seals from autumn through spring. The seals moved extensively in the lake, each covering minimal distances of 400-1,600 km between September and early May. They spent little time hauled out from September through May and, apparently, dived continuously. Dives were mostly to depths of 10-50 m, though a few exceeded 300 m. Most lasted between 2 and 6 min, within theoretical aerobic dive limits, although a few exceeded 40 min. The exceptionally long dives occurred while the seals were in areas of extensive ice cover, suggesting that they were, perhaps, under ice-pilotage in search of breathing holes rather than foraging dives. Otherwise, the dive performances of these Baikal seals were, relative to body mass, similar to those of other well-studied phocids. Movements and dive patterns of seals appeared to be primarily associated with seasonal and diel movements of their primary prey, golomyanka and sculpins, and secondarily correlated with patterns of ice formation and thaw.																			0824-0469					OCT	1996	12	4					528	542																WOS:A1996VL33400003

Epilimnetic temperatures were then near the upper lethal threshold for fall cisco larvae. Lac des Ecorces ciscoes are very small at the end of their 1st year of life (mean total length 58 mm). They more than double in length during their 2nd year (mean total length 161 mm). Growth thereafter, longevity, fecundity, and egg diameter are within the observed ranges for the species. Spawning occurs from mid-May to early June. Males and females spawn for the first time at age 3. The best predictor of fecundity is liver weight. Gametogenesis occurs under environmental conditions different from those encountered by fall-spawning salmonids. Seasonal changes in the gonadosomatic and hepatosomatic indexes are discussed in terms of temperature, photoperiod, and hormonal influences.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				JUN	1991	69	6					1644	1652		10.1139/z91-229	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z91-229													WOS:A1991GH35200027

Furthermore, the relationship between the water area and water level was analyzed. The main findings are as follows: (1) the peak water range in 2016 and 2017 was significantly larger than in 2018 and 2019. The water extent is large in the summer (maximum similar to 2650 km(2) in July 2016) and small in the winter (minimum similar to 600 km(2) in February 2017); (2) the spatial scale of water level fluctuated widely, while the temporal scale showed seasonal characteristics. Water level showed seasonal characteristics, with the higher water levels in summer (20.5 m in July 2016) and lower water levels in winter (8.8 m in October 2019); and (3) there was a strong agreement between water level and extent from 2016 to 2019, for which two models fitted by the logarithmic method had a small root mean square error (R1(2) = 0.67, RMSE1 = 9.02; R2(2) = 0.55; RMSE2 = 4.88).

Generally oligotrophic Lake Hoytiainen (283 km(2)) sustains one of the most economically valuable pikeperch stocks in Finland, and its annual fisheries yield (up to 5.5 kg/ha) is exceptionally high among Finnish lakes. Here, we followed seasonal movements of fish using conventional tagging, and studied short-term and long-term diet of pikeperch by stomach content and stable isotope analyses to examine if the movements were motivated by prey availability. A clear seasonal migration pattern was observed: in summer, 80% of the tag recoveries were obtained from the shallow and mesotrophic northern and western areas, whereas in autumn and winter, the deep and oligotrophic southern area dominated in the recaptures. The diet of pikeperch consisted of the most abundant fish species in the lake, perch (Perca fluviatilis) and roach (Rutilus rutilus), as well as insects. Stable isotope analysis indicated a shift from a dominance of pelagic food sources to littoral food sources during the growing season of pikeperch. Our results suggest that the pikeperch migrations facilitate efficient material transfer from the mesotrophic part while the deeper and oligotrophic part offers a favourable overwintering environment.

Migration routes, migration distances and stopover sites were determined, and the stopover home range was estimated for each individual. Individuals moved away from Yanchiwan during 2-25 October 2018 and migrated through Da Qaidam, Golmud City, Qumarleb County, Zadoi County, Zhidoi County, and Nagqu City. In mid-November 2018, the birds arrived in Linzhou County, Tibet, China to winter. The migration routes of all individuals were the same. and the average migration distance was 1,500 +/- 120 km. Da Qaidam Salt Lake was an important stopover site, with an average stopover duration of 27.11 +/- 8.43 d, and the average stopover range of the Black-necked Cranes at Da Qaidam was 27.4 +/- 6.92 km(2).

Temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, electrical conductivity, total suspended solids, Secchi disc transparency, ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, total nitrogen, soluble reactive phosphorus, total phosphorus and chlorophyll a were monitored in water column from January 2012 to June 2013. The study showed that Zinav Lake was a dimictic lake, which circulated in spring and fall, and thermally stratified in summer. Hypo-limnetic oxygen deficit and metalimnetic oxygen minima were the cases. Vertical distribution of dissolved oxygen and pH and ammonia accumulation in hypolimnion represented eutrophic/hypereutrophic conditions. The values and ratios of nutrients and chlorophyll a and Secchi disc transparency clearly classified Zinav Lake as eutrophic/hypereutrophic. Allochthonous loadings of organic matter and nutrients from the catchment and the changes in hydrological cycle by a power plant seem to be the most threatening factors controlling the water quality and trophic state in Zinav Lake.

In order to elucidate the relationships between photosynthetic activity of Microcystis, Microcystis genotypic composition, microcystin (MC) production and environmental factors, water samples and associated environmental data were collected from January to December 2014 in Lake Taihu. Seasonal variations in photosynthetic activity were measured using a Phyto-PAM Analyzer, abundances of total and toxic Microcystis genotypes were determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), and MC concentrations were quantified by HPLC. The maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (F-v/F-m) of Microcystis cells changed on a seasonal basis. F-v/F-m was not detectable in the winter, but increased from spring to early summer, after which, it gradually decreased until the winter. The level of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) increased from March to August and then decreased until December. qPCR data showed that the abundances of total Microcystis genotypes ranged from 1.91 x 10(5) to 8.64 x 10(7) copies/mL and toxic Microcystis genotypes ranged from 2.38 x 10(4) to 5.67 x 10(7) copies/mL. The toxic proportion varied from 12.5 to 65.6%, with an average value of 27.9%. Correlation analysis revealed that there was a positive correlation between photosynthetic activity, genotypic composition and MC production. Water temperature was the only environmental factor that was positively correlated with F-v/F-m, NPQ, total and toxic Microcystis and intracellular MC. Additionally, total phosphorus was also significantly correlated with intracellular MC. These results indicate that future global warming, in addition to eutrophication, could promote Microcystis blooms in Lake Taihu and that blooms may increase in intensity and toxicity.

J	Gilbert, JJ				Gilbert, John J.			Effect of low temperatures on the reproduction of summer and perennial rotifers from temperate regions: ecological and life cycle implications	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Summer and perennial planktonic rotifers from temperate regions can vary greatly in their ability to reproduce at low temperatures. The population growth rate (r day(-1)) of a Patagonian Keratella tropica was 0.025 at 3.9 degrees C and gradually increased to 0.083 at 9.3 degrees C. The ability of this rotifer to survive and reproduce at low winter temperatures suggests that populations in permanent waters with cold winters may have life cycles with little or no commitment to sexually produced diapausing eggs. In contrast, three Brachionus taxa from two localities in southeastern Australia reproduced poorly at low temperatures. At 3.9 degrees C, all females died before reproducing. At 6.1 degrees C, only a single amictic female of the Darling Brachionus (B. calyciflorus species complex) from Lake Littra survived to produce a few offspring. At 9.3 degrees C, amictic females of the Darling Brachionus from both Lake Littra and a billabong produced many more offspring (7-9 offspring female(-1)) than those of the Lake Littra B. calyciflorus and the billabong B. rubens (1-2 offspring female(-1)). At 14.9 degrees C, amictic females of the latter two taxa, and the Darling Brachionus from Lake Littra, produced many (14-17) offspring female(-1). Seasonal changes in temperature occurring in natural populations of these Brachionus taxa should have important ecological and evolutionary implications. Low temperatures likely favor the occurrence and reproduction of the Darling taxon. The inability of active individuals to survive and reproduce at low winter temperatures may be a factor favoring selection for sexual reproduction and production of resting eggs in both permanent and temporary water bodies.

Changes in spring phytoplankton communities and nutrient dynamics in the eastern basin of Lake Erie since the invasion of Dreissena spp.	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Distinct changes have occurred in the size and composition of the spring phytoplankton community in the eastern basin of Lake Erie following the introduction of Dreissena. Since 1996, total phytoplankton biovolume has decreased to approximately 20% of pre-Dreissena levels, whereas postinvasion concentrations of spring soluble nutrients, particularly silica, have been substantially elevated compared with earlier years. Spring dominance has shifted from a mix of pennate and large centric diatoms and pyrrophytes to three centric diatoms with high silica requirements: Aulacoseira islandica, Stephanodiscus hantzschii, and Stephanodiscus parvus, and the overall diversity and species richness of the spring phytoplankton community has declined significantly. In addition, current April silica concentrations are approximately twice as high as historical (i.e., 1960s-1980s) winter maxima, indicating that the silica content of the lake has increased since the dreissenid invasion. These results suggest that the severe silica depletion caused by increased anthropogenic inputs of nutrients during the last century has been mitigated through a decrease in diatom production, most likely brought about by dreissenid grazing.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JUL	2006	63	7					1549	1563		10.1139/F06-059	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F06-059													WOS:000239270600012

The dispersal of airborne material over the lake surface was investigated, and a method for the calculation of total input was developed. The component of the particulate matter larger than 1 mm contained the largest proportion of organic C; the dissolved and the fine particle (smaller than 1 mm) fractions made greater contributions to the inputs of N and P compounds. The importance of the large particle fraction of the airborne organic matter in the lake''s nutrient budget during the autumnal fall of litter was confirmed. The maximum total airborne input seems to occur during spring and summer. The input of P compounds through the atmosphere to small forest lakes is large compared to that from other sources. Airborne material accounts for 39% of the total P loading.																			0020-9309						1984	69	1					23	39		10.1002/iroh.19840690103	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19840690103													WOS:A1984SR74700002

At the intersection of these summer and winter rainfall regimes, respectively, is a Mars-like landscape consisting of expansive surfaces devoid of vegetation (i.e. absolute desert) except in canyons that originate high enough to experience runoff once every few years. Pollen assemblages from 39 fossil rodent middens in one of these canyons, Quebrada del Chaco (25 degrees 30' S), were used to infer the history of vegetation and precipitation at three elevations (2670-2800 m; 3100-3200 m; 3450-3500 m) over the past 50 000 years. When compared to modern conditions and fossil records to the north and south, the pollen evidence indicates more winter precipitation at >52, 40-33, 24-17 k cal. yr BP, more precipitation in both seasons at 1714 k cal. yr BP, and more summer precipitation from 14-11 k cal. yr BP. Younger middens are scarce at Quebrada del Chaco, and the few Holocene samples indicate hyperarid conditions comparable to today. The only exception is a pollen assemblage that indicates a brief but significant interlude of increased winter precipitation in the last millennium. Copyright (C) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

To address this issue, we counted migrating raptors between mid-August and mid-November 2008 from 24 observation points along eight transects perpendicular to the shoreline between Duluth and the Minnesota-Canadian border. Our goals were to determine migratory pathways over a large area (>2000 km(2)) and identify how these movements were affected by weather, time of day, season, and characteristics of the landscape. A total of 4303 raptors of 14 different species were counted during the 2008 migration season. Exploratory analyses suggested that migratory raptors concentrated near the northern shoreline of Lake Superior, particularly during midday when winds are westerly. Average migration height differed between soaring raptors (buteos and eagles) and accipiters, with >40% of soaring raptors observed higher than 100 m above the tree canopy and >= 30% of accipiters observed lower than 100 m above the tree canopy. Mixed models analysis identified the significant factors (P < 0.05) associated with total raptor migration: wind direction, time of day, temperature, and antecedent wind (number of days in which the wind did not have a westerly component prior to the observation days; R-2 = 0.23). Significant factors associated with soaring-raptor migration included wind direction, time of day, temperature, and seasonal interval (e.g., early or late in the migration season; R-2 = 0.17) and those associated with accipiter migration included time of day, temperature, antecedent wind, wind direction, and seasonal interval (R-2 = 0.29). With the increasing popularity of wind power development, information is needed regarding avian migratory pathways to avoid bird-turbine conflicts. The methodology and design of this study provided a means to quantify the magnitude, timing, pathways, and weather conditions associated with raptor migration over a large landscape.																			0892-1016	2162-4569				SEP	2012	46	3					283	295		10.3356/JRR-11-44.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.3356/JRR-11-44.1													WOS:000308340800005
J	Kangro, K; Laugaste, R; Noges, P; Ott, I				Kangro, K; Laugaste, R; Noges, P; Ott, I			Long-term changes and seasonal development of phytoplankton in a strongly stratified, hypertrophic lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Changes in the phytoplankton community of the hypertrophic, sharply stratified Lake Verevi have been studied over eight decades. Due to irregular discharge of urban wastewater, the trophic state of the lake has changed from moderately eutrophic to hypertrophic. We found that the trophic state in summer increased in the 1980s and remained at a hypertrophic level since then. Planktothri.y agardhii was recorded first in the 1950s and became the dominant species in the 1980s, forming biomass maxima under the ice and in the metalimnion during the vegetation period. In summer 1989, P. agardhii contributed almost 100% of the phytoplankton biomass. Generally, the highest biomass values occurred in the metalimnion. In spring, when P. agardhii was less numerous, diatoms and cryptophytes prevailed. In springs 2000 and 2001 different diatoms dominated - Synedra acus var. angustissinia (18.6 g m(-3)) and Cyclostephanos dubius (9.2 g m(-3)), respectively. In recent years, the spring overturn has been absent. In the conditions of strong thermal stratification sharp vertical gradients of light and nutrients caused a large number of vertically narrow niches in the water column. During a typical summer stage, the epilimnion, dominated by small flagellated chrysophytes, is nearly mesotrophic, and water transparency may reach 4 m. The lower part of the water column is hypertrophic with different species of cryptophytes and euglenophytes. A characteristic feature is the higher diversity of Chlorococcales. Often, species could form their peaks of biomass in very narrow layers, e.g. in August 2001 Ceratium hirundinella (18.6 g m(-3)) was found at a depth of 5 in (the lower part of the metalimnion with hypoxic conditions), Cryptonionas spp. (56 g m(-3)) at 6 in (with traces of oxygen and a relatively high content of dissolved organic matter) and euglenophytes (0.6 g m(-3))at 7 in and deeper (without oxygen and a high content of dissolved organic matter).

J	King, RS; Brazner, JC				King, RS; Brazner, JC			Coastal wetland insect communities along a trophic gradient in Green Bay, Lake Michigan	WETLANDS												Insects of Great Lakes coastal wetlands have received Little attention in spire of their importance in food webs and sensitivity to anthropogenic stressors. We characterized insect communities from four coastal wetlands that spanned the length of a trophic gradient in Green Bay during spring and summer of 1995. We sampled flying insects using sticky traps in dense emergent, sparse emergent, and open water-submergent vegetation zones within each wetland and estimated numerical abundance, biomass (mg dry weight) and taxonomic composition. We found that insect abundance and biomass were distributed differently among vegetation zones within wetlands along the gradient during both spring and summer. insect abundance was highest at oligotrophic Portage Marsh during spring and lowest in wetlands toward the lower (southern), eutrophic end of the bay. Biomass did not differ consistently along the trophic gradient but increased with increasing emergent vegetation cover in 3 of 4 wetlands during both seasons. Ordination revealed distinct gradients in community structure on both regional (i.e., upper, middle, and lower Green Bay) and local (vegetation zones within wetlands) scales. Wetlands sorted in order of trophic status during both seasons, primarily due to abundant small Chironomidae, such as trophic-sensitive Heterotrissocladius changi, in middle and upper bay wetlands. Chironomidae also were a dominant component of open water-submergent assemblages in all wetlands. Lower bay wetlands were characterized by fewer but larger Chironomidae (e.g., Chironomus spp.), as well as Ceratopogonidae, Calliphoridae, and Ephydridae, which were most abundant in stands of emergent vegetation. Our results suggest that eutrophy in the lower bay may contribute to relatively poor foraging conditions for insectivorous fish and young waterfowl during spring, and they demonstrate the utility of using insect communities to assess environmental degradation, such as excessive nutrient loading, in coastal wetlands of the Great Lakes.																			0277-5212					JUN	1999	19	2					426	437		10.1007/BF03161774	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03161774													WOS:000080960700013

Winter emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from temperate agricultural dams: fluxes, sources, and processes	ECOSPHERE												Through the microbial breakdown of organic matter and production of greenhouse gases (GHGs), small agricultural dams or ponds have recently been shown to make a relatively large contribution to freshwater ecosystem carbon cycling. However, current estimates of their total carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2-e) emissions lack inclusion of both seasonal and diel fluctuations. In addition, the atmospheric emissions of nitrous oxide from these often eutrophic systems have yet to be established. Here, we quantified the diffusive winter emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) from 12 small agricultural dams within southeast Australia over a 24-h period. The winter CO2-e emissions of small agricultural water bodies were similar to 92% lower than previous summer estimates, at 1.02 g.m(-2).d(-1), while N2O contributed just 3.2% of this total. We also show that diel cycles do not significantly affect winter CO2, CH4, or N2O emission rates, and we discuss the likely carbon sources to these systems, through analyses of stable carbon isotopes (delta C-13). The results from this study fill key gaps in our knowledge of agricultural dam GHG production and global atmospheric emissions, aiding their inclusion into future GHG budgets.

Movement behaviour of alien largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides in the estuarine headwater region of the Kowie River, South Africa	AFRICAN ZOOLOGY												The movement behaviour of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides in the estuarine headwater region of the Kowie River, South Africa, was investigated using passive acoustic telemetry. Ten adult fish were tagged and released in four discrete pools below a weir that precluded possible upriver migration. Their residency and movement patterns were monitored using 27 moored acoustic receivers spanning both riverine and estuarine habitats between January and November 2013. Small-scale movements ranging from 50 to 400 m occurred between pools in the headwater region, where tagged fish remained resident (did not leave their tagging pool) during the warmer (summer) months. The onset of autumn and winter correlated with declining water temperatures and half of the tagged largemouth bass made downstream excursions into the slightly warmer upper reaches of the estuary. The penetration of these alien piscivores into estuarine headwaters potentially provide additional predator pressure on the juveniles of migratory estuary-associated native marine fish species, which utilise these areas as nurseries. The presence of the alien fish in South African estuarine headwaters may impair the migration of juvenile fishes between the estuarine and freshwater environments.

Moraines M1-M13 are inferred to represent glacier halts or advance/readvance taking place during the Lateglacial and Holocene. The presence of collapse depressions suggests that some of them were ice cored (M1-M3). A chronological framework, taking into account a combination of former shorelines and related glacier-meltwater channels, lichenometry and AMS radiocarbon-dated lacustrine sediments spanning the last 20000 cal. yr BP, has been established. The distal glacier-fed lake Aspvatnet was isolated from the sea c. 10310 cal. yr BP, and the lacustrine sediments have been investigated by use of loss-on-ignition (LO1) magnetic susceptibility, water content, wet and dry bulk density (DBD), and the magnetic parameters anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) and saturation remanent magnetization (SIRM). There is, in general, good agreement between physical sediment parameters and magnetic parameters. DBD, a combination of medium and tine silt and the two statistical parameters 'sorting' and 'mean' have been used to construct a high-resolution glacier-fluctuation curve for the last 3800 cal. yr BP Based Oil an accumulation-area ratio (AAR) of 0.6 and an ablation-accumulation balance ratio (ABR) approach, a continuous temperature-precipitation-wind equilibrium-line altitude (TPW-ELA) curve for the last 20000 cal. yr BP has been constructed. Using an established exponential relationship between mean ablation-season temperature and mean annual solid precipitation at the ELA of Norwegian glaciers, variations in mean winter precipitation (snow) are quantified using an independent proxy for summer temperature. Mean annual winter precipitation varied from 500 to 5000 mm water equivalent, and on average, Holocene estimates are c. 50% higher than similar figures from the Lateglacial. The two driest periods occurred during Heinrich events 1 (H1) (17500-16500) and 0 (H0) (13000-12200), whereas freshwater pulses to the North Atlantic had apparently no systematic impact on mean winter precipitation. Based on the winter precipitation curve from Lyngen, the atmospheric circulation responded to the sea surface temperature (SST) lowering associated with H1 and H0. The dry and cold climate during the events led to formation of talus-derived rock glaciers at sea level.					; Bakke, Jostein/AAI-1145-2020	Paasche, Oyvind/0000-0003-0329-9063; Bakke, Jostein/0000-0001-6114-0400; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				MAY	2005	15	4					518	540		10.1191/0959683605hl815rp	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683605hl815rp													WOS:000229612700005

We used a linear programming model to construct balanced carbon flow charts for these two seasons based on measured primary productivity; on carbon standing stocks of algae, bacteria flagellates, ciliates, cladocerans, rotifers, and fish; and on data on turnover times, respiration, and grazing rates obtained in 1989. The charts were compiled to fit as closely as possible all observed and inferred estimates of carbon fluxes while simultaneously ensuring that mass balance and key biological constraints were maintained for each of the 10 compartments representing the principal biota of the Kinneret food web. We used the model to examine the extent to which individual intercompartmental flux rates were free to vary while the mass-balance and biological constraints were enforced. The model was also capable of generating different yet feasible flow-chart scenarios; it thus proved useful in suggesting alternative hypotheses concerning the role of the microbial food web in the euphotic waters of Lake Kinneret.

However, precise knowledge of water cycling, storage and losses across large scale catchments is required to sustainably meet growing water demands and adjust water management strategies. This study used four large-scale, seasonal synoptic surveys in 2021 to characterize the spatio-temporal patterns of water isotopes (stable water isotopes and radioisotope tritium at natural abundance) to better understand the complex hydrology of the intensively managed 10,000 km2 catchment of the River Spree in Germany. Apart from the upper headwaters, the hydrology of the Spree is heavily regulated by reservoir releases, pumped minewater discharges, extensive wetlands and lakes, water abstractions and urban drainage. Moreover, the catchment is drought-sensitive with potential evapotranspiration (-800 mm a year) often exceeding annual rainfall (-600 mm). This is reflected in the isotopic composition of river water: In the steeper, upper headwaters, the river has a "flashy" rainfall-runoff response, with isotopes plotting close to the Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL) consistent with dominant groundwater sources, but showing more influence by rainfall in winter. However, flows in the midstream parts are complex due to artificially enhanced baseflows and attenuated high flows from extensive reservoir releases and pumped groundwater releases from dewatering of mines. The reservoir waters are isotopically heavier and reflect the effects of open water evaporation. Fractionation effects strengthen downstream as managed wetland areas in the Spreewald and natural lakes further enhance evaporation and attenuate flows. Water abstractions for drinking water and to sustain the Oder-Spree canal reduce flows further. In Berlin, sources of urban runoff and waste water discharges reduce the effects of fractionation, though samples still plot below the meteoric water line. Seasonally, the effects of evaporation in the lower river network are strongest in summer and autumn, though they remain in winter and spring, indicating a large memory effect due to long mean travel times within the river system. Tritium variability along the river reflects inputs of younger and older water in different parts of the river system; though the influence of pumped groundwater means that the mean age of stream water (i.e., time elapsed since rainfall) in the lower river is likely to be >50 years. Climate change, together with increased population and economic growth in Berlin, is likely to increase pressures on the Spree system in future. In the coming years, the anticipated termination of the lignite mining will lead to a reduction in artificial inputs into surface water, which in turn may exacerbate water stress. We demonstrated that longer-term, synoptic isotope studies are valuable in better understanding the hydrology of such complex, large-scale, heavily modified river systems in terms of insights into water sources and mixing processes; thus, providing an evidence base for more sustainable management in the future.

The objective of our research was qualitative and quantitative analysis and bioindices of phytoplankton during and outside the tourist season. Analysis of phytoplankton assemblages were performed in 2011-2012. A total of 96 taxa were identified in Lake Jeziorak, mainly: Cyanobacteria - 20, Bacillariophyceae - 49, and Chlorophyta - 19. Biomass of the phytoplankton varied from 10 mg l(-1) in October to 29 mg l(-1) in May. In the whole research period, Cyanobacteria dominated and represented up to 68% of the total biomass. The cyanobacterial blooms were constantly observed. Biomass in the summer period was composed of filamentous Aphanizomenon gracile, Limnothrix redekei, Planktothrix agardhii and Pseudanabaena limnetica. Outside the holiday season, i.e. in autumn and spring, filamentous Cyanobacteria accompanied cryptomonads in phytoplankton. The species composition, the biomass of phytoplankton, and TSI indicate the hypertrophic conditions of the lake. Phytoplankton in Lake Jeziorak was in a state of equilibrium for almost the entire study period. S1 was a dominant group and its abundance and biomass did not change by more than 10%. There was no significant direct effect of the seasonal tourism impact on the development of phytoplankton in Lake Jeziorak.

Spatial and temporal variations of the water-sediment thermal structure in shallow ice-covered Lake Vendyurskoe (Northwestern Russia)	AQUATIC ECOLOGY					1st International Winter Limnology Symposium	MAY 24-28, 2008	Kilpisjarvi Biol Stn, Kilpisjarvi, FINLAND	Univ Jyvaskyla, Univ Joensuu, Univ Helsinki	Kilpisjarvi Biol Stn			The thermal structures in the vicinity of the ice-water and water-sediment boundaries of a shallow lake, L. Vendyurskoe (Northwestern Russia) during four winter seasons are described. The heat flux at the water-ice boundary was 0.1-0.2 W m(-2) during winter. The maximal heat flux at the water-sediment boundary was 4.5 W m(-2) at the beginning and 0.5 W m(-2) at the end of winter. The daily average value of the solar radiation penetrating into the water was 0.5 W m(-2) during main part of winter and 2-50 W m(-2) during April. During winter, temperature showed an oscillation in the vicinity of the sediment-water interface. Most periods corresponding to the main oscillation frequencies in the near-bottom water layer (0-0.4 m) and upper layer sediment (0-0.35 m), identified by FFT analysis, fall within the scale of synoptic variations (3-10 days), and in a number of cases were equal to 1 day. The theoretical periods of the first baroclinic seiche mode of Lake Vendyurskoe are 4.5-8.5 days that compares well with identified temperature oscillation periods. The comparison between the rate of heat content change in a water column and the difference of vertical heat fluxes from sediment to water and from water to ice show that the horizontal heat transport takes place in the lake during winter as a result of heat advection along the bottom.

Species composition, vertical distribution, abundance, nutrition type, and biomass were analyzed. In total, 293 species and supraspecific taxa of algae and cyanobacteria were found. Most of the identified species are marine, and 38 species are freshwater. Taxonomic composition changed in the lagoon throughout the year. Dinoflagellates dominated in winter and early June; unidentified cocci and flagellates in July; diatoms, dinoflagellates, and unidentified cells in August; dinoflagellates in September; and unidentified cocci and flagellates in October-November. The abundance of algae also changed in the lagoon throughout the year. The integrated biomass in the water column varied from 0.01 g C/m2 in January to 0.78 g C/m2 in early September. According to the environmental parameters, the water column of the lagoon was subdivided into several zones with different environmental conditions and corresponding phytoplankton communities. The similarity between the communities of different horizons was 32-46% in summer and 7% in winter. The chemocline layer was the most populous. It contained a maximum of phytoplankton biomass, 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than that in the overlying horizons. Despite the connection to the sea, the phytoplankton structure in the surface water layer in the lagoon and in the sea differed significantly in composition, quantitative parameters, and seasonal dynamics. The similarity between the communities never exceeded 50%. In terms of biomass dynamics, the lagoon lagged behind the sea until mid-summer, but, starting from August, it outnumbered it, and the phytoplankton development in the lagoon lasted longer, until late autumn. According to sequential tests DistLM, the phytoplankton structure and dynamics in the lagoon and in the sea were related to the daylength, water salinity, oxygen content, and pH by 24.5%. At the same time, the PhP structure did not depend on water temperature, underwater illuminance, or depth. Oxygen content and pH were defined by PhP activity. Salinity serves as a vector of the vertical sequence of ecological niches. The day length seems to be the crucial factor of the seasonal PhP dynamics in the semi-isolated coastal stratified lakes and lagoons.

At Castle Lake, extreme values of annual primary production, either much higher or lower than the long-term average, are likely to occur during the phenomenon of El Nino/Southern Oscillation. Two plausible pathways for the impacts of these large-scale climate events at Castle Lake were identified: winter snowfall, acting through its effect on the snow-ice pack and timing of the spring thaw; and total precipitation, acting through its effect on outwash rates. In contrast, no influence of large-scale climate events is apparent at Lake Tahoe, but a plausible pathway involving the impact of synoptic-scale phenomena on interannual variation was identified: local weather events occurring in the late winter-early spring period near the time of minimal stratification, acting through their effect on the depth of spring mixing. The difference between the two lakes can be attributed to absence of an ice cover and long hydraulic retention time at Lake Tahoe. Time-series models that incorporate meteorological information adequately forecast primary production at both lakes.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	1989	34	2					310	323		10.4319/lo.1989.34.2.0310	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1989.34.2.0310													WOS:A1989U538800004

Influence of the intertropical convergence zone on the East Asian monsoon	NATURE												The Asian - Australian monsoon is an important component of the Earth's climate system that influences the societal and economic activity of roughly half the world's population. The past strength of the rain-bearing East Asian summer monsoon can be reconstructed with archives such as cave deposits(1-3), but the winter monsoon has no such signature in the hydrological cycle and has thus proved difficult to reconstruct. Here we present high-resolution records of the magnetic properties and the titanium content of the sediments of Lake Huguang Maar in coastal southeast China over the past 16,000 years, which we use as proxies for the strength of the winter monsoon winds. We find evidence for stronger winter monsoon winds before the Bolling - Allerod warming, during the Younger Dryas episode and during the middle and late Holocene, when cave stalagmites suggest weaker summer monsoons(1-3). We conclude that this anticorrelation is best explained by migrations in the intertropical convergence zone. Similar migrations of the intertropical convergence zone have been observed in Central America for the period AD 700 to 900 (refs 4 - 6), suggesting global climatic changes at that time. From the coincidence in timing, we suggest that these migrations in the tropical rain belt could have contributed to the declines of both the Tang dynasty in China and the Classic Maya in Central America.

Winter is coming: Food web structure and seasonality in a subtropical freshwater coastal lake	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Food web studies provide a useful tool to assess the organization and complexity of natural communities. Nevertheless, the seasonal dynamics of food web properties, their environmental correlates, and potential association with community diversity and stability remain poorly studied. Here, we condensed an incomplete 6-year community dataset of a subtropical coastal lake to examine how monthly variation in diversity impacts food web structure over an idealized time series for an averaged year. Phytoplankton, zooplankton, macroinvertebrates, and fish were mostly resolved to species level (n = 120 trophospecies). Our results showed that the seasonal organization of the food web could be aggregated into two clusters of months grouped here as 'summer' and 'winter'. During 'winter', the food web decreases in size and complexity, with the number of trophospecies dropping from 106 to 82 (a 22.6% decrease in the number of nodes) and the trophic interactions from 1,049 to 637 between month extremes (a 39.3% drop in the number of links). The observed simplification in food web structure during 'winter' suggests that community stability is more vulnerable to the impact of any change during this period.

To test the hypothesis that ample storage of total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC) by V. americana could support a growth flush to compensate for its shorter growing season, plant tissues were collected over 2 annual cycles and analyzed for TNC. Both species exhibited marked seasonal patterns in percent TNC in above- and below-sediment plant parts. Mean TNC values in M. spicatum tissues were 1.6-19.0% for roots and 2.0-20.0% for shoots. The low values were associated with the spring growth flush. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences in these TNC storage and utilization patterns for roots and shoots, plants collected at different sites and plants collected at different times. V. americana tissues ranged 4-28% TNC during the growing season, while winter bud TNC values were about 45%. By virtue of low winter biomass, however, the total reserves in the Vallisneria community were inadequate to permit compensation for a late start in the spring, prompting rejection of the hypothesis.																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1979	102	2					263	272		10.2307/2424653	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2424653													WOS:A1979HT22300006

Significant horizontal and vertical structure was observed in the instantaneous, tidally driven flow and the residual, nontidal flow. This was especially evident through the deeper East Passage (EP), where persistent inflow was observed along the eastern side, and outflow along the western side of the channel. The residual volume transport of water to RIS is greater through the EP than through the West Passage entrance to the Bay, particularly in summer. Data from the offshore, or coastline-normal survey lines reveal a strong seasonal variability in RIS circulation. A residual (5-15 cm s(-1)) cyclonic coastal current is recorded within RIS during summer, stratified conditions. This residual current, which was not present during the winter surveys, enhances Narragansett Bay-RIS exchange by efficiently advecting the bay outflow to the southwest, away from the entrance. Results also indicate the resupply pathways for deep water to the entrance region vary in summer versus winter. Observed differences in RIS circulation, and related estuary-shelf exchange, have significant implications for physical, chemical, and biological models of Narragansett Bay.

J	HERLIHY, AT; MILLS, AL				HERLIHY, AT; MILLS, AL			SULFATE REDUCTION IN FRESH-WATER SEDIMENTS RECEIVING ACID-MINE DRAINAGE	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												One arm of Lake Anna, Virginia [USA], receives acid mine drainage (AMD) from Contrary Creek (SO42- concentration = 2-20 mM, pH = 2.5-3.5). Acid-volatile sulfide concentrations, SO42- reduction rates and interstitial SO42+ concentrations were measured at various depths in the sediment at 4 stations in 4 seasons to assess the effects of the AMD-added SO42- on bacterial SO42- reduction. Acid-volatile sulfide concentrations were always an order of magnitude higher at the stations receiving AMD than at a control station in another arm of the lake that received no AMD. Summer SO42- reduction rates were also an order of magnitude higher at stations that received AMD than at the control station (226 vs. 13.5 mmol m-2 day-1), but winter values were inconclusive, probably due to low sediment temperature (6.degree. C). Profiles of interstitial SO42- concentrations at the AMD stations showed a rapid decrease with depth (from 1270 to 6 .mu.M in the top 6 cm) due to rapid SO42- reduction. Bottom-water SO42- concentrations in the AMD-receiving arm were highest in winter and lowest in summer. There apparently is a significant enhancement of SO42- reduction in sediments receiving high SO42- inputs from AMD.

Impact of weather variability on spatial and seasonal dynamics of dissolved and suspended nutrients in water column of meromictic Lake Shira	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												Depths of thermocline and the redox zone, concentrations of dissolved and suspended carbon, and nitrogen and phosphorus in seston were measured in the pelagial of the saline meromictic Lake Shira (southern Siberia) in different years (2007-2011); the relationship of the values for those parameters with air-temperature variations was assessed. Positive correlations between both air temperatures in the previous year and the depth of the redox zone in winter and air temperature in April and the thermocline depth in summer were revealed. In the mixolimnion, the ratio of total nitrogen to total phosphorus almost always exceeded the Redfield ratio (16: 1); seston deficiency both in nitrogen and phosphorus was monitored in different seasons and at various depths. The amount of seston in the mixolimnion in summer almost doubled the amount of seston in winter and was directly related with the depth of the thermocline. In the monimolimnion, seston was rich in nitrogen and phosphorus. The amount of seston in the monimolimnion varied in different years and depended both on the air temperature in the previous year and the size of the zone.

J	Kufel, L				Kufel, L			Uncoupling of chlorophyll and nutrients in lakes - possible reasons, expected consequences	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Total phosphorus and total nitrogen explained a low percentage of summer chlorophyll variability in epilimnia of the Great Masurian Lakes. Division of the whole data set into two subgroups of lakes improved approximation of the chlorophyll nutrient relationship but revealed also functional differences between the lakes distinguished in that way. Chlorophyll in eutrophic lakes correlated well with nitrogen and phosphorus, that in mesotrophic lakes (those with summer chlorophyll < =22 mg m(-3) as calculated in the model) was related to none of the nutrients. Higher summer chlorophyll content in epilimnetic waters was accompanied by higher chl:PP and chl:PN ratios. Algal adaptation to poor light conditions in eutrophic lakes is postulated as a possible reason for that difference. Chlorophyll - nutrient relationships varied with the trophic status of lakes. Epilimnetic chlorophyll strictly followed phosphorus changes in eutrophic lakes but did not do so in mesotrophic ones. Detailed comparison of selected meso- and eutrophic lakes showed marked differences in the seasonal changes of chlorophyll and nutrient concentrations and in sedimentation rates, especially in spring. Nutrient limitation rather than zooplankton grazing is suggested as a possible mechanism of controlling algal abundance and the sequence of spring events in a eutrophic lake. It is hypothesised that phosphorus turnover in eutrophic lakes is dominated by seasonal vertical fluxes, while in mesotrophic lakes it is more conservative with consumption and regeneration restricted mostly to metalimnion. Possible consequences of such conclusion are discussed in the paper.

Validation studies have been performed mainly in laboratories and mesocosm experiments, however large-scale field experiments are necessary to verify the robustness of eDNA based monitoring for more specific applications and different environmental conditions. Here, eDNA samples were collected from three fishponds with high fish density and broad species diversity during summer and autumn. This sampling design included a large number of spatial replicates evenly spaced across the pond surface and samples from the inflow, while pooled samples were used to test the effect of filtration volumes on detectability. Most common species were detected using eDNA, but rare species were often missed out under these high stocking densities. Average read counts and site occupancy positively correlated strongly with species abundance and biomass, with the exception of samples affected by PCR inhibition. Higher diversity detections were observed in autumn compared to summer samplings and in running compared to standing water. Fish communities detected in pooled samples reflect the overall community structure, and the species detectability increases with higher filtration volumes. This work highlights how eDNA based surveys can be optimised based on sampling conditions to achieve the highest overall detection, which has important implications for applying this method to aid management and policy initiatives.

J	EVANS, MS; JUDE, DJ				EVANS, MS; JUDE, DJ			RECENT SHIFTS IN DAPHNIA COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN SOUTHEASTERN LAKE-MICHIGAN - A COMPARISON OF THE INSHORE AND OFFSHORE REGIONS	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Before 1982, Daphnia ratrocurva and Daphnia galeata mendotae were the dominant species of Daphnia in Lake Michigan. Between 1972 and 1981, Daphnia community structure in the offshore region shifted toward greater dominance of the larger D. galeata mendotae, with Daphnia pulicaria, another large species, dominating by 1982. This continued through summer 1984. Shifts in offshore Daphnia community structure appear to be rleated to a reduction in predation pressure by declining alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) populations and a hypothesized increase in relative predation pressure by Mysis relicta. From 1972 to 1984, Daphnia community structure changed only slightly in the inshore region; D. retrocurva generally remained the summer and autumn dominant. However, summer Daphnia abundances decreased after 1980 as yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and bloater (Coregonus hoyi) increased. From an examination of historic data we conclude that inshore offshore Daphnia complex, however, differed markedly from the earliest (mid-1950s) record of zooplankton community structure in this region of southeastern Lake Michigan.

Growth in weight was linear during June through September; increments averaged 11.1 g per half month. Growth increased sharply in October to several times the summer rate. We speculate that the increase in growth in October is explained partly by water temperature and partly by an increase in appetite related to the onset of gonadal development. The greater compression of biomass accumulation in autumn than has been previously demonstrated better explains the autumn pulse of sea lamprey induced host mortality. Based on the seasonal pattern of growth and on recaptures of marked sea lampreys, we conclude that landlocked individuals grow to adult size and mature in one parasitic growth year. Regressions of weight (grams) on total length (millimetres) differed significantly among months, and the season of collection must be considered in predicting weight from length.																			0706-652X					JUN	1995	52	6					1257	1264		10.1139/f95-122	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f95-122													WOS:A1995TA79400013

Biodiversity Assessment of a Mississippi River Backwater Complex Using eDNA Metabarcoding	DIVERSITY-BASEL												The backwater lowland habitats of large rivers, like the Mississippi River in North America, present complex and often inaccessible environments for traditional capture-based fish biodiversity sampling. Our knowledge of the assemblages of the fishes that occupy such habitats is often incomplete, and this can compromise management efforts. We employed environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding methods to sample a Mississippi River bottom wetland system to assess the ichthyofaunal diversity and the assemblage structure across habitat types, and we compared our results with capture-based survey records for the same habitats. We collected water samples in the spring and fall of 2022 from slough, ditch, shallow lake, and bayou habitats that varied in depth, vegetation, seasonal variability, and connectivity to the Mississippi River channel. We detected a diverse array of fish species that included 51 taxa. Nearly all the species previously documented in the habitats were detected using eDNA metabarcoding, and we increased the number of documented species by more than a third. Most of the species were ubiquitous across the range of habitats, but there was also a substantial assemblage structure, with some species exhibiting clear habitat specificity. Fall sampling was limited to the deeper bayou habitats where seasonal variation between the spring and fall was minimal. eDNA metabarcode sampling was demonstrated to be effective at detecting invasive species as well as uncommon species, which included several species of conservation concern.

J	Yan, RH; Yao, J; Tian, F; Gao, JF				Yan, Renhua; Yao, Jing; Tian, Feng; Gao, Junfeng			A novel framework for turbidity source apportionment of the urban lakeside river network	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Turbidity source apportionment is essential but complex for precise environmental rehabilitation of worldwide urban lakeside river networks impaired by turbidity. A new turbidity source analysis framework including in-situ sampling, vessel monitoring, remote sensing, and hydrodynamic modelling was proposed, where the critical processes of flow reversal from the turbid lake, navigation, and urban non-point source in urban lakeside river networks were explicitly considered. The case study results showed that the turbidity problem (mean value was 211.3 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU)) was primarily led by suspended inorganic matter (58%), followed by suspended organic matter (19%) and other matter. The Tiaoxi River and busy shipping contributed most to the annual total suspended solids load of the target river, with the same percentage of 34%. The turbid Lake Taihu provided 64,663 tonnes and 31% of the total suspended solids load, focusing on the autumn and winter months. Tiaoxi River load was highly concentrated on the storm events, which accounted for 71.4% of the annual Tiaoxi River source (209846 tonnes). The large water volume of reverse flow and the high TSS concentration of Lake Taihu in the autumn and winter months accounted for the seasonal change in Lake Taihu's TSS load. The coronavirus disease lockdown reduced the mean monthly total suspended solids concentration of 152.4 mg/L in November and December 2019 to 49.2 mg/L in January and February 2020, by limiting the waterway transportation and the market demand for building materials. The river estuary's vegetation interception belt, shipping restriction and rerouting, and integrated catchment management were advised to mitigate the urban river network turbidity.

In addition, a multivariate statistical analysis and nutrient addition experiments were used to analyze the regulation of bacterioplankton growth in situ. Biomass ranged between 170 (winter) and 2,200 Mg C m-2 (summer); production ranged from 10 (winter) to 625 mg C m-2 d-2 (summer); annual bacterioplankton production was 47 g C m-2 yr-1 in 1987 and 67 in 1988. Population growth rates ranged between 0.001 and 0.081 h-1. Growth rates in the epilimnion were substantially below estimated potential rates, suggesting severe nutrient limitation during the period of stratification. Population growth rates were highly correlated with P concentrations but not with dissolved organic C concentrations. Bacterioplankton growth in the summer epilimnion responded strongly to the addition of P alone or in combination with N or labile organic C. The field data show that bacterioplankton are frequently without sufficient nutrients to sustain maximum growth; the experimental and statistical analyses indicate that P, rather than organic C, is the critical nutrient for bacterioplankton growth in this lake.																			0024-3590					SEP	1992	37	6					1179	1192		10.4319/lo.1992.37.6.1179	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1992.37.6.1179													WOS:A1992KR91400004

Twenty-one species of water birds were identified belonging to 11 families, out of which 13 species were passage visitors, 4 species were migrant winter, 2 species were Resident breeder and migratory breeder each. We have observed that the highest number of species (11 species) was found in autumn-winter months. The Mallard duck Anas platyrhychos was highly dominant species together accounting for more than 34.61% of water bird communities. We also found that environmental changes have affected water birds with some species increasing in numbers and others seesawing on the verge of local extinction. Hence, we suggest that regular monitoring of the site should be carried out so as to control changes in the state of wetland ecosystem.																			0972-9984	0973-7308					2018	33	4					103	111																WOS:000482616900008

Effective mitigation strategies require the sources of N deposition to be identified and the contributions from individual sources to be quantified. Determination of the isotopic composition represents a useful approach in source apportionment. In this study, the delta N-15-NHx of wet and dry atmospheric deposition and the main NH3 emission sources were analyzed at an urban, a suburban and a rural site in the Taihu Lake region of China. The 2-year average delta N-15- of precipitation was - 3.0 +/- 2.3, - 3.1 +/- 2.8 and - 0.5 +/- 2.8aEuro degrees for the urban, suburban and rural sites, respectively. These values were much lower than the corresponding values for particulate (15.9, 15.2 and 14.3aEuro degrees at the urban, suburban and rural sites, respectively), and much higher than those of gaseous delta N-15-NH3 (- 16.7, - 18.2 and - 17.4aEuro degrees at the urban, suburban and rural sites, respectively). The delta N-15-NH3 of NH3 from the main emission sources ranged from - 30.8 to - 3.3aEuro degrees for volatilized fertilizer, from - 35.1 to - 10.5aEuro degrees for emissions from a pig farm, and - 24.7 to - 11.3aEuro degrees for emissions from a dairy farm. Temporal variations of deposition delta N-15-NHx indicated that delta N-15-NHx values were lower in summer and autumn, but higher in winter and spring for both precipitation -N and gaseous NH3-N. Weather conditions such as temperature and precipitation significantly influenced the spatial and temporal distribution of isotope values of the deposition. Analysis of delta N-15-NHx in deposition and emission sources identified volatilized fertilizer and livestock wastes as the origins of both gaseous NH3-N and precipitation -N over the region. A stable isotope mixing model estimated that volatilized fertilizer and animal excreta contributed more than 65% to precipitation -N, more than 60% to particulate -N, and more than 75% to gaseous NH3-N.					gao, bo/HHC-7855-2022	TI, CHAOPU/0000-0002-6660-8188													0168-2563	1573-515X				MAR	2018	138	1					85	102		10.1007/s10533-018-0432-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-018-0432-3													WOS:000427059700005

The Relative Effects of Willow Invasion, Willow Control and Hydrology on Wetland Zooplankton Assemblages	WETLANDS												Few studies have examined zooplankton assemblages associated with grey willow (Salix cinerea) invasions in wetlands. Our aim was to quantitatively examine zooplankton composition amongS. cinereastands within the South Taupo Wetland, New Zealand, to determine whether these assemblages are affected by willow growth and willow control treatment using the herbicide metsulfuron (C14H15N5O6S). Alternatively, we examined whether wetland hydrology had an over-riding influence. Sampling was performed on three occasions (late-summer, mid-winter, and early-summer). Using Multidimensional Scaling and ANOSIM, we found no significant differences in zooplankton composition or environmental variables among native vegetation, live and deadS. cinereasites, except for a difference in willow canopy density between late summer and winter. However, zooplankton composition differed on either side of a sand bar, suggesting areas separated by this barrier functioned independently. Overall, we found zooplankton communities to be regulated more by wetland hydrology than by willow presence. A limited willow effect was possibly due to the wetland being at an early stage of invasion, representing stand-alone individuals, with a continuous canopy not yet having formed. Alternatively, willows have lesser effects on invertebrates in wetlands than in streams. Ground control treatment ofS. cinereausing metsulfuron had no apparent impact.

Daily temperature experience and selection by adfluvial bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus)	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) are a thermally sensitive cold-water species with a threatened conservation status across much of North America. To improve our understanding of bull trout thermal ecology, we tagged more than 150 adults with temperature-sensing acoustic biotelemetry transmitters and monitored the animals in a British Columbia reservoir for two years. Thermal resource selection was estimated in open water from the summer to autumn as the system transitioned to isothermal conditions. On average, bull trout thermal history tracked seasonal changes and remained close to the optimum temperatures for growth and metabolism. As summer progressed, bull trout increasingly selected temperatures of 11-15 degrees C as they became less available within the water column. Selection indicated the movement to shallower waters where 11-15 degrees C temperatures existed. The results show that bull trout mainly occupy a narrow range of temperatures which suggests the importance of cold-water refuge for the species.					; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010	Gutowsky, Lee/0000-0003-1244-9465; Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; 													0378-1909	1573-5133				OCT	2017	100	10					1167	1180		10.1007/s10641-017-0634-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-017-0634-x													WOS:000412840700002

Microzooplankton distribution displayed strong spatial and temporal variability (1.73-28.5 mu g C/L) relative to phytoplankton distribution. Ciliates were the dominant component especially in the spring and early summer. Rotifers and dinoflagellates increased toward late summer/fall in the inner and outer parts of the bay, respectively. Microzooplankton grazing matched bacterial growth rates and removed ca. 30% of the phytoplankton standing stock in the <100 mu m size fraction per day. The greatest herbivory occurred at the site dominated by colonial cyanobacteria. Microzooplankton, which comprised <4% of the quagga mussels prey field (i.e. available prey), contributed 77% and 34% to the quagga carbon-based diet during Microcystis and diatom blooms, respectively. Feeding on microzooplankton could buffer mussels during lean periods, or supplement other consumed resources, particularly during noxious cyanobacterial blooms. The results of this study demonstrate that microzooplankton are a resilient and critical component of the Saginaw Bay ecosystem. (C) 2013 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

We report the results of a survey conducted from 1993-1995 among Michigan anglers. The survey was designed to identify a reproductive-aged cohort of persons who consume high or low levels of Great Lakes fish in order to study the impact of polyhalogenated biphenyl (PHB) compounds and other toxins on human reproduction outcomes. Using fishing license data obtained from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, we identified anglers of early reproductive age (18-34 years) in ten Michigan counties. The screening survey ascertained demographic, behavioral, fish consumption, and reproductive history information on anglers and their partners. Over 4,000 angler households were contacted. One thousand nine hundred fifty questionnaires were returned from 1,168 households. The median age of respondents was 30 years; 58% were male and 64% reported being married. Slightly more than one-half the respondents had attended or graduated from college, and less than 10% had not completed high school. In the past year, most respondents (46%) reported having eaten sport-caught fish 1-12 times, while 20% reported having eaten no sport-caught fish; 20% had consumed 13-24 meals. More sport-caught fish was consumed in the spring and summer than in the fall and winter, and males reported eating more fish than females. About 43% of our respondents reported that they intend to have one or more children in the next five years. Of these respondents, 287 couples had no identified impairments to reproduction and therefore would be eligible to participate in the future reproductive study.																			0748-2337					MAY-AUG	1996	12	3-4					347	359		10.1177/074823379601200307	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/074823379601200307								8843552					WOS:A1996VA69300007

Despite the ongoing rise in scientific production on spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of water quality parameters, such as total nitrogen (TN) in reservoirs, attempts to use published data and incorporate them into a large-scale comparison and trends analyses are lacking. Here, we propose a framework of Data extraction, Data grouping and Statistical analysis (DDS) and illustrate application of this DDS framework with the example of TN in reservoirs. Among 1722 publications related to TN in reservoirs, 58 TN time-series data from 19 reservoirs met the analysis requirements and were extracted using the DDS framework. We performed statistical analysis on these time-series data using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) combined with agglomerative hierarchical clustering as well as Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape (GAMLSS). Three patterns of seasonal TN dynamics were identified. In Pattern V-Sum, TN concentrations change in a "V" shape, dropping to its lowest value in summer; in Pattern PSum, TN increases in late summer/early fall before decreasing again; and in Pattern P-Spr, TN peaks in spring. Identified patterns were driven by phytoplankton growth and precipitation (Pattern V-Sum), nitrate wet deposition and agricultural runoff (Pattern P-Sum), and anthropogenic discharges (Pattern P-Spr). Application of the DDS framework has identified a key bottleneck in assessing the dynamics of TN - low data accessibility and availability. Providing an easily accessible data sharing platform and increasing the accessibility and availability of raw data for research will facilitate improvements and expand the applicability of the DDS framework. Identification of additional spatiotemporal patterns of water quality parameters can provide new insights for more comprehensive pollution control and management of aquatic ecosystems.					guo, Z.F./GQP-9434-2022; Faghihinia, Maede/ABB-3637-2020; XU, Yaoyang/J-9809-2012	Guo, Zhaofeng/0000-0001-9921-2182; Faghihinia, Maede/0000-0002-8953-1945; 													0043-1354	1879-2448				AUG 1	2021	201								117380	10.1016/j.watres.2021.117380	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.117380		JUN 2021						34198201					WOS:000684282100005

Nine monogenean species were found: Dactylogyrus sphyrna Linstow, 1878, D. falcatus (Wedl, 1857), D. difformoides Glaser and Gussev, 1971, D. wunderi Bykhovskii, 1931, D. cornu Linstow, 1878, D. cornoides Glaser and Gussev, 1971, D. distinguendus Nybelin, 1937, Gyrodactylus sp. and Paradiplozoon sp. Of these monogeneans, D. sphyrna, D. cornu and D. cornoides were numerically dominant in all the host specimens examined, each having a prevalence of 100% in some spring and summer months. These were followed in numerical dominance and prevalence by D. distinguendus and Gyrodactylus sp. The other parasite species were found infrequently, four or five species groups predominated particularly during the spring and summer months. D. wunderi and D. falcatus, found only in June and July on just three host specimens, are new records for Turkey.																			1300-6045					MAY-JUN	2012	18			SA			A23	A28																WOS:000303296300005

However, between these migrations, they spend most of time in growth habitats such as rivers. To investigate the diel and seasonal activities, homing behaviour and home range of yellow-phase Japanese eels in the lower reach of the Tone River, we tracked them throughout a year using a fine-scale positioning system (VPS) based on acoustic telemetry. The tracked eels were generally nocturnal, but not exclusively. They were mainly mobile from spring to autumn, with little or no activity observed during winter. A transport-release experiment showed that most eels returned to their original capture area within 13days after release. The eels had very small home ranges (mean +/- SD=0.085 +/- 0.068km(2)), core areas (0.014 +/- 0.014km(2)) and linear home ranges (744 +/- 268m). They also tended to be distributed on one particular side of the river (right or left bank) and in one particular shore type (revetment or vegetation), rarely moving from one to the other. This study provides evidence for nocturnal, dormancy, homing behaviours, limited habitat use and small home range size in Japanese eels. The eels clearly showed strong fidelity to a familiar site, which contrasts with the long distances travelled during upstream and downstream migration phases in the river, and during spawning migrations in the ocean.					; Miyake, Yoichi/I-5796-2017; Kimura, Shingo/AAI-2209-2020; Itakura, Hikaru/KVY-5257-2024	Kimura, Shingo/0000-0001-8378-6181; Miyake, Yoichi/0000-0003-2799-7827; Kitagawa, Takashik/0000-0002-4688-1064; Itakura, Hikaru/0000-0001-8596-5407													0906-6691	1600-0633				JUL	2018	27	3					737	751		10.1111/eff.12389	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12389													WOS:000434638800010

Food and water security in a changing arctic climate	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												In the Arctic, permafrost extends up to 500 m below the ground surface, and it is generally just the top metre that thaws in summer. Lakes, rivers, and wetlands on the arctic landscape are normally not connected with groundwater in the same way that they are in temperate regions. When the surface is frozen in winter, only lakes deeper than 2 m and rivers with significant flow retain liquid water. Surface water is largely abundant in summer, when it serves as a breeding ground for fish, birds, and mammals. In winter, many mammals and birds are forced to migrate out of the Arctic. Fish must seek out lakes or rivers deep enough to provide good overwintering habitat. Humans in the Arctic rely on surface water in many ways. Surface water meets domestic needs such as drinking, cooking, and cleaning as well as subsistence and industrial demands. Indigenous communities depend on sea ice and waterways for transportation across the landscape and access to traditional country foods. The minerals, mining, and oil and gas industries also use large quantities of surface water during winter to build ice roads and maintain infrastructure. As demand for this limited, but heavily-relied-upon resource continues to increase, it is now more critical than ever to understand the impacts of climate change on food and water security in the Arctic.					; Loring, Philip/I-1716-2019	Loring, Philip/0000-0001-6039-2331; 													1748-9326					OCT-DEC	2007	2	4							045018	10.1088/1748-9326/2/4/045018	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/2/4/045018													WOS:000253653000023
J	Diana, JS; Hanchin, P; Popoff, N				Diana, James S.; Hanchin, Patrick; Popoff, Nicholas			Movement patterns and spawning sites of muskellunge Esox masquinongy in the Antrim chain of lakes, Michigan	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												The purpose of this study was to identify spawning habitat, determine home ranges, and examine movement patterns for a naturally reproducing population of Great Lakes muskellunge in the lower Antrim County chain of lakes, Michigan. Muskellunge spawning sites were identified by tracking of implanted muskellunge using a directional hydrophone and by nighttime spotlight surveys. All spawning fish tagged in Torch or Clam Lake spawned in Clam Lake, while most spawning fish tagged in Elk or Skegemog Lake spawned in the Torch River; one appeared to spawn in Lake Skegemog. Of the 32 potential spawning sites, 28 (87.5 %) contained submerged aquatic vegetation as the dominant habitat type, while the remaining 4 sites were divided equally between woody debris (6.25 %) and bare substrate. All but one implanted muskellunge returned from spawning sites to the same lake in which they were captured and implanted. Of the 24 tagged muskellunge, four were harvested via angling or spearing within 1 year after tagging, and two additional fish were assumed harvested when contact was lost. Implanted muskellunge tended to remain in the lakes during the winter, then move into spawning areas in spring, eventually returning to open lake sites where they resided over summer. Muskellunge movement behavior diverged after spawning each year, with 11 tagged fish (61.1 %) remaining in Skegemog or Clam Lake for the summer, and seven individuals traveling to Elk or Torch Lake. Muskellunge home ranges averaged 612 ha and ranged from 17 to 5,287 ha.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				MAR	2015	98	3					833	844		10.1007/s10641-014-0319-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-014-0319-7													WOS:000349029800008

Three-dimensional winter modeling and the effects of ice cover on hydrodynamics, thermal structure and water quality in Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A 3-dimensional numerical model of Lake Erie was set up for a winter season using a coupled hydrodynamic and water quality model (ELCOM-CAEDYM) and validated against observations. The model was successful in predicting average lake surface temperature (root mean square deviation, RMSD <0.87 degrees C) when compared with the available observed temperature profile (RMSD < 0.78 degrees C). The ice cover hind cast favorably agrees with observations (ice coverage RMSD = 3.1 x 10(3) km(2), similar to 10% of the lake surface, and thickness RMSD = 2.1 cm). This study illustrates the importance of the inclusion of ice cover when simulating hydrodynamics and lake water quality. For example, the water level oscillations were significantly reduced under ice cover conditions. Although the model is not calibrated for water quality during winter conditions, the predicted variations in DO and Chl-a are qualitatively in agreement for all three basins of Lake Erie. Similar to recent field observations, our model results also suggest that despite low temperatures and low under-ice light availability, winter conditions can support high phytoplankton biomass in the central basin which is at least comparable to that typically observed in the summer. Our results also indicate that simulations without ice-cover during the winter results in higher phytoplankton biomass in the central basin compared to that in the scenario with ice. This suggests that changes in the extent of ice cover, its thickness and duration will influence winter productivity with the consequences for hypoxia to develop later in the season.

Here, we examine the factors influencing these measurements and their associated weekly variability. At both sites there was a progressive increase in the measured temperature, but the rate of increase was very much greater in Lake Windermere. The variance of the Lake Windermere temperatures was negatively correlated with the cloud cover, but there was no corresponding relationship in Lough Feeagh. Comparisons with the Lamb system of weather classification showed that the lake temperatures were closely correlated with these synoptic conditions. The highest winter temperatures were recorded during "westerly" conditions and the highest summer temperatures under "southerly" conditions. The most striking difference between the lakes was their response to cold winters and windy summers. Such results demonstrate that lakes that are topographically different "filter" the imposed climate signal in subtly different ways.

J	Kaukoranta, T; Tahvonen, R; Ylämäki, A				Kaukoranta, Timo; Tahvonen, Risto; Ylamaki, Arto			Climatic potential and risks for apple growing by 2040	AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD SCIENCE												The impact of climatic change in 1971-2040 on the potential production areas and risks to nine apple cultivars (Malus domestica Borkh.) was studied over continental Finland using agro-climatic indices and gridded daily mean (T-m) and minimum temperatures from the Rossby Centre regional atmospheric climate model (RCA3) with SRES A2. Point data on daily minimum temperatures from 14 weather stations and low and high warming scenarios were also used. From the 1970's to the present day, the areas of successful maturing of fruits have strongly expanded northwards. It is predicted that in 2011-2040, the warming of climate will allow expansion of commercial production in the south-eastern lake area, and a wider selection of cultivars for home gardens up to latitudes 65-66 degrees N. Risk of extremely low temperatures (T-m<-26 degrees C) has reduced from 1980's to the present but may not reduce much more in 2011-2040. Risk to shoots from fluctuating temperatures in winter and spring is likely to increase under the high warming scenario, more in the south-west than in the south-east. Risk to trees from cold days (T-m<-15 degrees C) with a concurrent thin snow cover is not predicted to increase. In the western inland of the country, below latitude 63 degrees N, and in the south-western coast areas the frost risk during flowering may increase, especially in the early flowering cultivars. In order to adapt to and gain from the climatic change, breeding and testing targets should be modified within five years and they should include reduced sensitivity to temperature fluctuation in winter, late flowering, and frost tolerance of flowers.																			1459-6067	1795-1895				AUG	2010	19	2					144	159		10.2137/145960610791542352	http://dx.doi.org/10.2137/145960610791542352													WOS:000281782800005

From a 58-year study on the bass population of Lake Opeongo Ontario, both individual growth and recruitment are shown to be strongly affected by variations in summer air temperatures and by variations in bass population abundance: growth rates among pre-reproductive age groups are higher when summers are warmer and when population abundance is reduced; recruitment is higher when summers are warmer and when adult abundance is higher. In a regional study of spawning timing that included the Lake Opeongo population, plus populations in nine additional lakes, a single relationship was found that could predict both temporal and spatial variations in the timing of spawning, using information on spring water temperatures and the size distribution of mature males. This relationship was used, along with historical patterns of variation in both spring water temperature regimes and male size distributions, to predict long-term, regional patterns of variation in spawning times. These expected patterns of variation were used to define objective measures of the risks associated with different opening dates for the fishing season. We discuss the respective roles of scientist and policy maker in establishing management regulations for individual populations, and for groups of populations in geographically distinct regions.

Over time, using it for recreational purposes became a serious health hazard and bathing was banned due to chemical and microbiological risks. The purpose of the collaborative project "Safe Ruhr" was to verify the current status and to provide a scientific basis for lifting the bathing ban. As the river also provides a raw water source for drinking water production, it was investigated how well the treatment procedures control possible hygienic risks. As study area, the barrier Lake Baldeney was chosen as it embraces earlier bathing sites and tributes to river bank filtration water for drinking water treatment plants. The hygienic condition of the river water was determined over 18 months by measuring general physical, chemical and microbiological water quality parameters including fecal indicators, bacterial obligate and facultative pathogens, parasitic protozoa, enteric viruses and schistosome parasites (Trichobilharzia). Samples were taken at eight locations including sites before and after receiving the discharge of stormwater and treated wastewater, potential future bathing sites and a raw water abstraction point for potable water production. In summary, for all investigated physico-chemical parameters no significant difference between the eight investigated sampling locations on a distinct sampling date were observed. This study focused on hygienically relevant bacteria and parasitic protozoa. Fecal indicators, Escherichia coli, intestinal enterococci and Clostridium perfringens as well as coliform bacteria were detected in 94-100% of the water samples. Enteric pathogens, including Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella enterica, were isolated from 33% and 28% of the samples, respectively, in relatively low concentrations. Among the environmental facultative pathogens, P. aeruginosa was detected at a high frequency of 82% of all samples, but in low numbers, while Aeromonas spp. were found in all water samples in relative high concentrations. The levels of all target organisms were not clearly associated with sources of pollution, with the exception of slightly enhanced numbers of coliform bacteria and E. coli downstream of a sewage discharge point from a wastewater treatment plant. Seasonal variations were observed with higher detection rates of Campylobacter spp. in winter and S. enterica in autumn and winter.in contrast to the other bacterial groups, which showed no significant fluctuations throughout the year. Precipitation within two days prior to sampling resulted in a trend of enhanced numbers of coliform bacteria, E. coli, intestinal enterococci and Aeromonas. Sampling and analysis of parasitic protozoa was carried out in accordance to the European bathing water guideline and the ISO 15553 method. Characteristics of the river (flow, vegetation, birds protection zone, bathing of people, sewage etc.) were compared to the number of organisms detected. All in all 184 samples were investigated for Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp. 80% of the samples were positive for Giardia spp. with a mean of 5 cysts/1001 (0.1-157.9). Highest values were achieved in autumn and winter, lowest values during the assumed bathing season. There seemed to be a trend to lower values in and after a reservoir in the river course, but with no statistical significance. A statistical significance could be shown for higher concentrations after heavy rainfall that led to discharge of combined sewage overflows in the city of Essen. Only 29% of the samples were positive for Cryptosporidium spp. with a single maximum value of 27.7 and all other concentrations below 5 oocysts/100 I. On a low level there seemed to be slightly higher findings during summer and bathing season than in autumn and winter. No correlation to heavy rainfall could be found. The findings correspond to earlier results from the River Rhine (Germany). The influence of sewage on the water quality of the Ruhr could be shown from the correlation of Giardia load and activity of combined sewage overflows after heavy rainfall. The rare and low findings of Cryptosporidium spp. lead to the same conclusion, that microbial water quality in the investigation area is rather influenced from sewage water than from diffuse water sources into the River Ruhr.

The source water, water samples in each unit along the drinking water treatment process, as well as the drinking water product in both urban and rural area in different seasons have been included. The total concentrations of detected PPCPs range from 6.37 ng/L to 809.28 ng/L, the level of which is higher than other reports in China. In summer, more kinds of PPCPs were at higher concentrations in drinking water in urban area in spite of that fewer kinds of PPCPs were detected in raw water than in winter. It mainly because some kinds of PPCPs, which can be still detected under higher temperature and stronger irradiation in summer, were hardly removed by the drinking water treatment plant (DWTP). Therefore, people are at relatively higher health risk by PPCPs exposure through the intake of drinking water during summer than winter. The advanced treatment which applied GAC (granular activated carbon) filtration improved 2% to 46% of removal efficiency on PPCPs compared with conventional process, for which advanced treatment processes should be advocated in more DWTPs in China. In rural private wells, the situation is more worrying. Twelve more kinds of PPCPs were detected in rural drinking water than in urban, of which the max concentration reached 107 ng/L. The total concentrations of PPCPs in drinking water in rural area were obviously higher than in urban area, which lead to risk quotient (RQ) values of 4-6 times higher. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Berry; Huey, Suey; Doyle, Georgia A.; Swanson, Eric E.; Hackett, Ed			Oxyanion Concentrations in Eastern Sierra Nevada Rivers-2. Arsenic and Phosphate	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Water samples were collected from the Truckee River-Pyramid Lake system, the Walker River-Walker Lake system, and the Carson River, all located in eastern California and western Nevada, U.S.A., at three different times (i.e., summer 1991, spring 1992, and autumn 1992) over a two year period. The concentrations of As, Na, Cl, Sigma PO4, and pH were measured in these river samples and the associated terminal lakes. Arsenic values ranged from below 13 nmol/kg near Truckee, California to 160 nmol/kg at Nixon, Nevada in the Truckee River, from 40 nmol/kg in the headwaters of both West and East Walker Rivers to 270 nmol/kg below Weber Reservoir on the main branch of the Walker River, and from < 27 nmol/kg to 234 nmol/kg for the lower Carson River system. Arsenic concentrations in Steamboat Creek (0.91 mu mol/kg-1.80 mu mol/kg) in the Truckee River catchment are above the U.S. EPA drinking water maximum contaminant level of 0.67 mu mol/kg, as are the As concentrations in both Pyramid Lake (1.33 mu mol/kg-1.57 mu mol/kg) and Walker Lake (13.7 mu mol/kg-18.7 mu mol/kg). Sources of As for all three rivers include weathering of As-rich rocks and/or regolith and input of high-As geothermal spring waters, both processes primarily, although not exclusively, adding As to the headwater regions of these rivers. Steamboat Hot Springs (29 mu mol/kg <= As <= 54.5 mu mol/kg), for example, is identified as a source of As to the Truckee River via Steamboat Creek. The high As concentrations in Pyramid and Walker Lakes are likely due to (1) desorption of arsenate from aquatic particulate matter in these high pH waters (9.0 <= pH <= 9.5), (2) limited biologic uptake of arsenate, and (3) evaporative concentration of the lake waters. Evaluation of molar Sigma PO4/As ratios of river waters and geothermal spring waters (e.g., Steamboat Hot Springs), indicates that phosphate is substantially enriched in Steamboat Creek as well as the mid to lower reaches of the Walker and Carson Rivers. These regions of each river are dominated by agricultural interests and, additionally, in the case of Steamboat Creek, residential areas and golf courses. Our data strongly imply that phosphate-rich agricultural return flow has likely added P to these streams and, consequently, increased their respective P: As ratios.					; Johannesson, K/G-9187-2012	Johannesson, Karen/0000-0001-8140-8160; 													1380-6165	1573-1421				MAR	1997	3	1					61	97		10.1023/A:1009640008497	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1009640008497													WOS:000209214200004

It is shown, that these relationships were strongly revealed in the last 1997-98 El Nino, which caused anomalous air temperature and evaporation increase throughout Western Mexico territory and, as a consequence, I m downturn of the Chapala lake level since January till June, 1998. To investigate 1997-1998 El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon (ENSO 1997-98) AVHRR-NOAA satellite image analysis of the Chapala Lake surface water temperature (LCST) was performed. These images provide a temperature database for 1996-99 (38 months). Analysis of annual and seasonal LCST fluctuations was carried out using monthly averages for this period. Time series analysis on the LCST data suggest that seasonal surface temperature variations may be almost completely obscured by the annual harmonic. In 1998 the temperature pattern was altered due to the El Nino 1997-98 episode. In winter the water surface temperature was on average almost 1 degreesC lower than the temperature values registered in 1996. However, for the summer and autumn of 1998, such temperatures were 1.5 degrees? higher in comparison with the reference year of 1996. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Salinity responds to changes in climate and human activity, with significant impacts on water quality and ecosystem services. In this study, Sentinel-2A/B Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) images and quasi-synchronous field data were utilized to estimate lake salinity using machine learning approaches (i.e., XGB, CNN, DNN, and RFR). Atmospheric correction for MSI images was tested using six processors (ACOLITE, C2RCC, POLYMER, MUMM, iCOR, and Sen2Cor). The most accurate model and atmospheric correction method were found to be the extreme gradient boosting tree combined with the ACOLITE correction algorithm. These were used to develop a salinity model (N = 70, mean absolute percentage error = 9.95%) and applied to eight lakes in Inner Mongolia from 2016 to 2024. Seasonal and interannual variations were explored, along with an examination of potential drivers of salinity changes over time. Average salinities in the autumn and spring were higher than in the summer. The highest salinities were observed in the lake centers and tended to be consistent and homogeneous. Interannual trends in salinity were evident in several lakes, influenced by evaporation and precipitation. Climate factors were the primary drivers of interannual salinity trends in most lakes.

Chemical and biological responses to phosphorus control	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Moore, B.C. and D. Christensen 2009. Newman Lake restoration: A case study. Part I. Chemical and biological responses to phosphorus control. Lake Reserv. Manage. 25:337-350. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, summer and fall blooms of cyanobacteria began to occur in Newman Lake, Washington (z(avg): 5.6 m, z(max): 9.0 m); through the next decade, these blooms intensified and became an annual occurrence. Community efforts in the mid-1980s sparked a Restoration Feasibility assessment of the lake and watershed that indicated total annual gross phosphorus loading of at least 3000 kg, with a major portion (similar to 83%) attributable to internal recycling associated with summer hypolimnetic oxygen depletion. Implementation activities began September 1989, with watershed controls and a whole-lake alum treatment, followed in 1992 by installation of a Speece cone for hypolimnetic oxygenation and in 1997 by addition of a dual-port, microfloc alum injection system. Average summer volume-weighted total phosphorus has declined from prerestoration levels exceeding 50 mu g-P/L to an average of 21 mu g-P/L over the past 7 years (15-28 mu g-P/L). Most notably, peak annual biovolumes of cyanobacteria and their representation within the phytoplankton community have decreased substantially, with increased prevalence of diatoms, green and golden-brown algae. A clearwater phase following spring blooms of diatom and/or golden-brown algae has occurred during those last 7 years, although this phenomenon was observed in the prior three decades. Overall, the restoration has been a success, and lake response to nutrient reduction at Newman Lake is consistent with worldwide observations that emphasize the need for long-term perspectives and commitment in lake restoration and management. Continuation of internal load controls and increased emphasis on external nutrient abatement will be necessary to continue the positive water quality trends despite future development increases and land use changes.

J	Gao, Q; Reynolds, JF				Gao, Q; Reynolds, JF			Historical shrub-grass transitions in the northern Chihuahuan Desert: modeling the effects of shifting rainfall seasonality and event size over a landscape gradient	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												We use a spatially explicit landscape model to investigate the potential role of rainfall on shrub-grass transitions in the Jornada Basin of southern New Mexico during the past century. In long-term simulations (1915-1998) along a 2700 m transect running from a dry lake bed to the foothills of a small mountain, we test two hypotheses: (i) that wetter winters and drier summers may have facilitated shrub encroachment in grasslands, and (ii) that increases in large precipitation events may have increased soil water recharge at deeper layers, thus favoring shrub establishment and growth. Our model simulations generally support the hypothesis that wetter winters and drier summers may have played a key role, but we are unable to reproduce the major shifts from grass- to shrub-domination that occurred in this landscape during the early part of the 1900s; furthermore, the positive shrub response to wetter winters and drier summers was only realized subsequent to the drought of 1951-1956, which was a relatively short 'window of opportunity' for increased shrub establishment and growth. Our simulations also generally support the hypothesis that an increase in the number of large precipitation events may also have favored shrub establishment and growth, although these results are equivocal, depending upon what constitutes a 'large' event and the timing of such events. We found complex interactions among (i) the amount/seasonality of rainfall, (ii) its redistribution in the landscape via run-on and runoff, (iii) the depth of the soil water recharge, and (iv) subsequent water availability for the growth and reproduction of shrubs vs. herbaceous plants at various landscape positions. Our results suggest that only a mechanistic understanding of these interactions, plus the role of domestic cattle grazing, will enable us to elucidate fully the relative importance of biotic vs. abiotic factors in vegetation dynamics in this semiarid landscape.					; Reynolds, James/G-6364-2010	Reynolds, James/0000-0003-2367-879X; 													1354-1013	1365-2486				OCT	2003	9	10					1475	1493		10.1046/j.1365-2486.2003.00676.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2486.2003.00676.x													WOS:000185841900012
J	COUNCIL, TC; BENNETT, PC				COUNCIL, TC; BENNETT, PC			GEOCHEMISTRY OF IKAITE FORMATION AT MONO LAKE, CALIFORNIA - IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ORIGIN OF TUFA MOUNDS	GEOLOGY												The mineral ikaite (CaCO3 . 6H2O), not previously observed in lake environments, precipitates seasonally along the shore of Mono Lake, California, where Ca-HCO3 spring water mixes with cold Na-CO3 lake water. During the winter, cold water temperatures and high concentrations of PO43- and organic carbon inhibit calcite precipitation, allowing the metastable ikaite to form. During the spring warning, however, ikaite decomposes to form calcium carbonate and water, occasionally leaving pseudomorphs of the primary precipitate. The identification of modern ikaite suggests that both Pleistocene and Holocene tufas in the Mono basin originally precipitated as ikaite. This mineral may also form in other lake environments, but rapid recrystallization after warming destroys the physical, chemical, and isotopic evidence of formation, and alters the geochemical record.																			0091-7613					NOV	1993	21	11					971	974		10.1130/0091-7613(1993)021<0971:GOIFAM>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0091-7613(1993)021<0971:GOIFAM>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1993ME75900003

An integrated study of photochemical function and expression of a key photochemical gene (psbA) in photosynthetic communities of Lake Bonney (McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica)	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Lake Bonney is one of several permanently ice-covered lakes in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, which maintain the only year-round biological activity on the Antarctic continent. Vertically stratified populations of autotrophic microorganisms occupying the water columns are adapted to numerous extreme conditions, including very low light, hypersalinity, ultra-oligotrophy and low temperatures. In this study, we integrated molecular biology, microscopy, flow cytometry, and functional photochemical analyses of the photosynthetic communities residing in the east and west basins of dry valley Lake Bonney. Diversity and abundance of the psbA gene encoding a major protein of the photosystem II reaction center were monitored during the seasonal transition between Antarctic summer (24-h daylight) to winter (24-h darkness). Vertical trends through the photic zone in psbA abundance (DNA and mRNA) closely matched that of primary production in both lobes. Seasonal trends in psbA transcripts differed between the two lobes, with psbA expression in the west basin exhibiting a transient rise in early Fall. Last, using spectroscopic and flow cytometric analyses, we provide the first evidence that the Lake Bonney photosynthetic community is dominated by picophytoplankton that possess photosynthetic apparatus adapted to extreme shade.

The average ice-covered period was 182 days while the longest ice-covered period was 193 days. The average lake water temperature at ice formation was 0.5-10degreesC, while the average water temperature just before ice break-up was close to 4degreesC. The heat flux from water to ice was low during early winter but could increase above 5 Wm-2 (daily average) during the last month before ice break-up. The heat flux from sediment to water was the main source of heat to the water body during early to mid winter being about 2-6 W.m-2 during early winter but decreasing to about 1-2 Wm-2 during early spring.

Calculated/measured dry deposition flux ratios of ambient air arsenic species at five characteristic sampling sites in the years 2009-2010 are determined using two dry deposition models. An analysis reveals that the average concentrations of arsenic species in TSPs and dry deposits were highest at the Quan-xing sampling site, located in a severely polluted area where numerous industrial factories are located. The average seasonal concentrations of arsenic species in TSPs were highest in winter and fall in all instances. Analytical results reveal that low-wind conditions increased the concentrations of arsenic species in fall and winter at the five study sampling sites. Finally, Noll and Fang's model yielded the best predictions of the dry-deposited ambient air arsenic species (As, As(III), and As(V)) dry deposition for when the particles were larger than 5.6 mu m, while Baklanov and Sorensen's model yielded the most accurate results when the particles were smaller than 5.6 mu m.

Geobiology Course 2017; Geobiology Course 2018	Microbial succession and dynamics in meromictic Mono Lake, California	GEOBIOLOGY												Mono Lake is a closed-basin, hypersaline, alkaline lake located in Eastern Sierra Nevada, California, that is dominated by microbial life. This unique ecosystem offers a natural laboratory for probing microbial community responses to environmental change. In 2017, a heavy snowpack and subsequent runoff led Mono Lake to transition from annually mixed (monomictic) to indefinitely stratified (meromictic). We followed microbial succession during this limnological shift, establishing a two-year (2017-2018) water-column time series of geochemical and microbiological data. Following meromictic conditions, anoxia persisted below the chemocline and reduced compounds such as sulfide and ammonium increased in concentration from near 0 to similar to 400 and similar to 150 mu M, respectively, throughout 2018. We observed significant microbial succession, with trends varying by water depth. In the epilimnion (above the chemocline), aerobic heterotrophs were displaced by phototrophic genera when a large bloom of cyanobacteria appeared in fall 2018. Bacteria in the hypolimnion (below the chemocline) had a delayed, but systematic, response reflecting colonization by sediment "seed bank" communities. Phototrophic sulfide-oxidizing bacteria appeared first in summer 2017, followed by microbes associated with anaerobic fermentation in spring 2018, and eventually sulfate-reducing taxa by fall 2018. This slow shift indicated that multi-year meromixis was required to establish a sulfate-reducing community in Mono Lake, although sulfide oxidizers thrive throughout mixing regimes. The abundant green alga Picocystis remained the dominant primary producer during the meromixis event, abundant throughout the water column including in the hypolimnion despite the absence of light and prevalence of sulfide. Our study adds to the growing literature describing microbial resistance and resilience during lake mixing events related to climatic events and environmental change.					; Osburn, Magdalena/K-1985-2019; Wang, Xingchen/O-2757-2014; Speth, Daan/OGP-3533-2025; Orphan, Victoria/AAS-5989-2020; Sessions, Alex/ABC-9207-2020	Monteverde, Danielle/0000-0002-0198-8220; Medeiros, Patricia/0000-0001-6818-2603; Phillips, Alexandra/0000-0001-5959-5238; Berelson, William/0000-0002-1526-3802; Osburn, Magdalena/0000-0001-9180-559X; wu, fenfang/0000-0003-1134-280X; Speth, Daan Rogier/0000-0002-2361-5935; Wang, Xingchen (Tony)/0000-0001-5316-789X													1472-4677	1472-4669				JUL	2021	19	4					376	393		10.1111/gbi.12437	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gbi.12437		FEB 2021						33629529					WOS:000621330400001

J	Kufel, L; Kalinowska, K				Kufel, L; Kalinowska, K			Metalimnetic gradients and the vertical distribution of phosphorus in a eutrophic lake	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Analyses of the vertical distribution of phosphorus in a eutrophic lake showed constant accumulation of soluble reactive phosphorus and total P in the hypolimnion following spring diatom blooming. The downward flux of phosphorus was realised mostly in spring due to high rates of sedimentation and aerobic decomposition of algal biomass. Nearly two thirds of hypolimnetic phosphate-P accumulation had occurred before the hypolimnion became deoxygenated. An increase in soluble reactive P in the hypolimnion by a further 100 mg P m(-3) took place during summer, most probably due to internal P loading from bottom sediments. Distinct gradients of phosphorus, chlorophyll, alkaline phosphatase activity and seston across the thermocline coupled with a low sedimentation rate in the summer presented evidence for the barrier role of the metalimnetic zone in vertical fluxes of matter in a lake. Possible consequences of this phenomenon for phosphorus cycling in a lake are discussed.

J	MUSKO, IB				MUSKO, IB			OCCURRENCE OF AMPHIPODA IN HUNGARY SINCE 1853	CRUSTACEANA												Since the first finding in 1853 (Frivaldszky, 1865), 27 Amphipoda have been reported from Hungary, half of them being Niphargus species. The other amphipod species belong to the genera Gammarus, Dikerogammarus, Echinogammarus, Corophium, Synurella, Orchestia, and Talitrus. The most detailed data are avaiable from Lake Balaton where altogether 8 species were found in different habitats, only a few species occurring together. In the 1930s Corophium curvispinum invaded Lake Balaton. This species was reported from Hungary for the first time in 1916 (from the Danube). In the 1950s Dikerogammarus species replaced Gammarus roeselii in the lake. We investigated the ecology of the Amphipoda fauna in Lake Balaton from 1983 to 1987. Both on the submerged macrophytes and in the stony littoral zone of Lake Balaton Corophium curvispinum, Dikerogammarus haemobaphes, and Dikerogammarus villosus occur, with dominancy of Corophium curvispinum. C. curvispinum and D. haemobaphes, living on the submerged macrophyte Myriophyllum spicatum near Tihany peninsula, reproduce in late spring, summer, and early autumn. They produce two generations a year. The biomass of C. curvispinum and D. haemobaphes was roughly 11 and 0.1 g animal dry wt.m-2, respectively, in mid-July 1986, in areas covered by Myriophyllum spicatum.																			0011-216X					MAR	1994	66		2				144	152		10.1163/156854094X00639	http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156854094X00639													WOS:A1994NF55100002

The potential of near-entrance stalagmites as high-resolution terrestrial paleoclimate proxies: Application of isotope and trace-element geochemistry to seasonally-resolved chronology	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Sub-annually resolved environmental proxies can be valuable archives of climate change, but they are rare in terrestrial settings, and it can be difficult to verify their annual nature. We suggest that speleothems that grow in well-ventilated zones of caves may preserve such high-resolution records. Near-entrance cave environments are characterized by year-round, near-atmospheric CO2 concentrations and are significantly influenced by surface air temperature fluctuations, particularly in temperate latitudes. Previous monitoring studies of a well-ventilated, temperate-latitude cave (Westcave Preserve, central Texas) have documented seasonal variations in the oxygen isotope composition of calcite grown on glass substrates (with winter delta O-18 maxima and summer delta O-18 minima) as well as seasonal variations in drip water trace element compositions. Extending this work to a stalagmite (WC-3) from the same drip site, we find that stalagmite delta O-18 variations are similar in magnitude to the seasonal delta O-18 variations previously observed for calcite grown on glass substrates, that stalagmite [Mg] variations have a similar seasonal period with winter minima and summer maxima, and that geochemical variations follow stalagmite growth fabric as mm-scale couplets comprising thin, slow-growing, compact sparry calcite laminae (winters) and thicker, fast-growing, porous-elongate columnar calcite laminae (summers). We interpret a high-resolution (weekly to monthly) 52-year record of delta O-18, Mg, Sr, and Ba in WC-3, and report new monthly measurements of drip water and associated calcite grown on glass substrates. We find drip water delta O-18 and [Mg]/[Ca] are essentially invariant and that seasonal variations in WC-3 calcite delta O-18 and Mg concentration agree well with predicted temperature-dependent fractionation between water and calcite. WC-3 calcite Sr and Ba also vary, but with higher and more variable frequencies compared to delta O-18 and [Mg]. The annual nature of delta O-18 and [Mg] cycles is supported by monitoring and C-14 bomb-peak chronology. We suggest that stalagmite delta O-18 and [Mg] vary primarily in response to large seasonal temperature changes in this setting, allowing for unambiguous differentiation between summer and winter calcite growth. From such delta O-18- and [Mg]- derived sub-annual chronologies, the timing of enrichments in other geochemical species that are less directly coupled to external cave temperature (e.g., calcite Sr and Ba) can be considered as proxies of other important processes such as water-rock interaction in the epikarst, precipitation events, or subsurface respiration rates. The potential for this kind of multi-proxy, seasonally-resolved dating may add near-entrance stalagmites to the list (ice cores, lake varves, tree rings) of high-resolution terrestrial proxies available for paleoclimate studies.

The total suspended matter (TSM) produced by the economic development in the upper reaches of the reservoir and its surrounding areas has brought great ecological harm to the safe operation of the reservoir. Satellite remote sensing technology provides a good way to obtain the temporal and spatial variation of TSM in the study area. Two field surveys were carried out in the Yuqiao Reservoir, a total of 44 sampling points collected in the two tests. The spectral data and concentration of TSM were obtained. We developed and validated a robust empirical model to estimate the concentration of TSM in the water of the Yuqiao Reservoir for the first time. The TSM distribution map of the Yuqiao Reservoir in 2013-2018 is retrieved based on Landsat 8 OLI images. This paper analyzes the spatial distribution characteristics of TSM concentration in the Yuqiao Reservoir for several years, as well as the interannual, seasonal, and monthly variation laws and development trends. The results show that the spatial distribution of TSM in Yuqiao Reservoir shows a decreasing trend from the periphery to the center; the interannual changes are mainly as follows: The annual change trend of TSM in Yuqiao Reservoir is not obvious; the seasonal changes are significant: the highest in summer (higher than 40 mg/L), the second in autumn, and the lowest in spring and winter (lower than 15 mg/L); and the monthly changes show regular fluctuations: In a year cycle, the concentration of TSM generally shows an inverted V-shaped trend; that is, TSM increases gradually from January to August and decreases gradually from August to December. The research results of this paper can be applied to other similar types of land water bodies, which will promote the wide application of Landsat 8 OLI images in the monitoring of TSM in lakes, rivers, and reservoirs in different regions across China, and provide data support for the scientific management of the safe operation of research areas. Practitioner points The monitoring model of TSM in Yuqiao Reservoir was built for the first time. Temporal and spatial analysis of TSM concentration in Yuqiao Reservoir for the first time. The concentration of TSM is in Yuqiao Reservoir greatly affected by wind speed and precipitation.					li, Wei/MVX-4382-2025; Liu, Zhiheng/HGC-7605-2022; Cao, Hongye/ABB-7239-2020; li, liangzhi/CAA-1615-2022	Liu, Zhiheng/0000-0002-2794-3557; 													1061-4303	1554-7531				APR	2021	93	4					582	595		10.1002/wer.1460	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wer.1460		OCT 2020						32954623					WOS:000581642300001

Using Sentinel-2 images from April to November within the 2016-2020 period coupled with the Google Earth Engine Platform, we calculated FUI to analyse the spatial distribution, seasonal variations, and inter-annual variations of water colour in Baiyangdian Lake in the Xiong'an New Area established on 1 April 2017. The lake was divided into seven sub-regions, A-G; subsequently, high and low FUI values were observed in the south and north, respectively. Additionally, the mean FUI values of G and F zones in the south were 11.9 and 12.7, respectively, whereas those for the A, B, C, D, and E zones in the north were 10.5, 9.8, 10.4, 11.1, 11.2, respectively. The seasonal variations in the Baiyangdian Lake and seven sub-regions were consistent, with turbid water in spring and autumn, and clear water in summer. Inter-annual variations analyses for 2016-2020 indicated that the zone of A became progressively turbid, whereas the B, C, D, E, F, and G zones exhibited slow and gradually decreasing trends. Our findings suggest that the overall water quality of Baiyangdian Lake may be better, which may be related to the governance policies of the region.

J	Nishihiro, J; Araki, S; Fujiwara, N; Washitani, I				Nishihiro, J; Araki, S; Fujiwara, N; Washitani, I			Germination characteristics of lakeshore plants under an artificially stabilized water regime	AQUATIC BOTANY												To examine the possibility of the failure of lakeshore plants to germinate under an anthropogenically controlled water regime, we investigated physiological germination responses to temperature and inundation among 25 lakeshore plant species from Lake Kasumigaura, Japan. The requirement of low temperature for dormancy breakage, which is common in spring-gerimnators, was seen in 14 species. Eight species showed sensitivity to temperature fluctuation, which is thought to be relevant to bare ground detection for germination. Seed germination of most species was significantly reduced under inundation. Seedling emergencies under outdoor conditions in which the wet and inundated conditions of the natural lakeshore habitat were simulated showed that the timing of all species was concentrated in spring. A significant reduction of emergence in the inundated condition was observed in 19 species. Therefore, most of the lakeshore plant species are adapted to germinate in spring on exposed bare ground during low-water periods. The recent imposition of water level control with a winter-spring elevation possibly prevents regeneration of most common lakeshore plants through the loss of seasonal safe sites for germination.

J	Shi, KF; Wang, P; Yin, H; Lang, Q; Wang, HZ; Chen, GX				Shi, Kaifang; Wang, Peng; Yin, Hang; Lang, Qi; Wang, Haozhi; Chen, Guoxin			Dissolved Oxygen Inversion Based on Himawari-8 Imagery and Machine Learning: A Case Study of Lake Chaohu	WATER												Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration is a widely used and effective indicator for assessing water quality and pollution in aquatic environments. Continuous and large-scale inversion of water environments using remote sensing imagery has become a hot topic in water environmental research. Remote sensing technology has been extensively applied in water quality monitoring, but its limited sampling frequency necessitates the development of a high-frequency dynamic water quality monitoring model. In this study, we utilized Lake Chaohu as a case study. Firstly, we constructed a dynamic water quality inversion model for monitoring DO concentrations using machine learning methods, with Himawari-8 (H8) satellite imagery as input data and DO concentrations in Lake Chaohu as output data. Secondly, the developed DO concentration inversion model was employed to estimate the overall grid-based DO concentration in the Lake Chaohu region for the years 2019 to 2021. Lastly, Pearson correlation analysis and significance tests were performed to examine the correlation and significance between the estimated grid-based DO concentration and the ERA5 reanalysis dataset. The results demonstrate that the Random Forest (RF) model performs best in DO concentration inversion, with a high R2 score of 0.84, and low RMSE and MAE values of 0.69 and 0.54, respectively. Compared to other models, the RF model improves average performance with a 38% increase in R-2, 13% decrease in RMSE, and 33% decrease in MAE. The model accurately predicts DO concentrations. Furthermore, the inversion results reveal seasonal differences in DO concentrations in Lake Chaohu from 2019 to 2021, with higher concentrations in spring and winter, and lower concentrations in summer and autumn. The average DO concentrations in the northwest, central-south, and northeast regions of Lake Chaohu are 10.12 mg/L, 9.98 mg/L, and 9.96 mg/L, respectively, with higher concentrations in the northwest region. Pearson correlation analysis indicates a significant correlation (p < 0.01) between DO concentrations and temperature, surface pressure, latent heat flux from the atmosphere to the surface, and latent heat flux from the surface to the atmosphere, with correlation coefficients of -0.615, 0.583, -0.480, and 0.444, respectively. The results verify the feasibility of using synchronous satellites for real-time inversion of DO concentrations, providing a more efficient, economical, and accurate means for real-time monitoring of DO concentrations. This study has practical value in improving the efficiency and accuracy of water environmental monitoring.

Microbial dinitrogen and nitrous oxide production in a small eutrophic reservoir: An in situ approach to quantifying hypolimnetic process rates	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Nitrogen (N) dynamics within the hypolimnion of a thermally stratified reservoir were examined to test an in situ approach to measuring dinitrogen (N(2)) and nitrous oxide (N(2)O) production rates wherein hypolimnion gas accumulation is used to estimate N(2) and N(2)O production. This previously unpublished approach provides a spatially integrated, time-varying record of N transformation rates that fall well within the range of rates reported for other reservoir systems using other methods. Hypolimnion N(2) production averaged 183 mu mol N(2)-N m(-2) h(-1) with higher rates observed early in a spring stratification event (538 mu mol N(2)-N m(-2) h(-1)) and lower rates observed later in the same stratification event (90 mu mol N(2)-N m(-2) h(-1)). Sediment incubation experiments and hypolimnion nitrate (NO(3)(-)) data show that, over the course of the summer, progressive NO(3)(-) depletion at the sediment-water interface limited N(2) production and associated N removal. As rates of N(2) production dropped off, rates of N(2)O production increased (from 4.62 mu mol N(2)O-N m(-2) d(-1) to 51 mu mol N(2)O-N m(-2) d(-1), averaging 26 mu mol N(2)O-N m(-2) d(-1)), resulting in significant increases in N(2)O-N : N(2)-N ratios as the summer progressed. Also, whereas N(2) production appeared to occur predominantly at the sediment-water interface, N(2)O production was detected throughout the water column, suggesting a role for nitrification as a source of N(2)O. The use of hypolimnion accumulation to quantify N transformation rates can thus offer new insights into spatial and seasonal N transformation patterns in stratified or otherwise capped aquatic systems.

In most cases, the photographic-derived data showed no significant difference in phenophase score from manually observed field records from the same period, demonstrating the accuracy and potential of using weekly repeat photography as a quicker, cheaper and more adaptable tool to remotely study phenology in both biological and physical systems. Overall, increases in ambient temperatures coupled with decreases in winter ice and snow cover, and earlier occurrence of birch foliage, signal a reduction in the length of winter, a shift towards earlier springs and an increase in the length of available growing season in the Swedish sub-arctic.

In both species, the date of hatching was associated with the date of ice break-up; more clearly so in northern Finland than in southern Finland. The date of hatching was neither associated with the winter NAO (December-March) nor with the spring NAO (March-May). There was no difference between southern and northern populations in terms of the annual differences (in days) between the timing of ice break-up and the timing of hatching. However, in both species, this difference decreased with increasing lateness of the spring in the north, the corresponding trend being less clear in the south.

Elevated summer temperatures delay spawning and reduce redd construction for resident brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis)	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Redd (nest) surveys for resident brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) were conducted annually in a mountain lake in northern New York for 11years with multiple surveys conducted during the spawning season in eight of those years. Repeated surveys throughout the spawning season allowed us to fit an individually based parametric model and estimate the day of year on which spawning was initiated, reached its midpoint, and ended during each year. Spawning phenology was then assessed relative to (1) mean of maximum daily air temperature and (2) mean of maximum daily water temperature at the lake bottom during summer in each year using a linear model. Elevated temperatures in summer were correlated with a delay in spawning and a reduction in the total number of redds constructed. Increasing the summer mean of maximum daily air temperatures by 1 degrees C delayed spawning by approximately 1week and decreased the total number of redds constructed by nearly 65. Lake spawning brook trout select redd sites based on the presence of discharging groundwater that is relatively constant in temperature within and across years, leading to relatively consistent egg incubation times. Therefore, delayed spawning is likely to delay fry emergence, which could influence emergence synchrony with prey items. This work highlights non-lethal and sub-lethal effects of elevated summer temperatures on native resident salmonids in aquatic environments with limited thermal refugia.

J	Carvalho, L; Kirika, A				Carvalho, L; Kirika, A			Changes in shallow lake functioning: response to climate change and nutrient reduction	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Conference on Limnology of Shallow Lakes	MAY 25-30, 2002	BALATONFURED, HUNGARY	Veszprem Univ, Acad Sci & Dept Limnol, Balaton Linmol Inst Hungarian				Nutrient, phytoplankton and zooplankton dynamics have been monitored intensively at Loch Leven for 34 years. The data collected reveal a decline in phosphorus concentrations, following major reductions in external nutrient loading, and large changes in its seasonal availability, particularly in recent years. More striking has been an increasing trend in water temperatures, annual means increasing by about 1degreesC over the 34 years, with even greater increases observed for winter and spring periods. In response to these changes, there has been a general pattern of decline in measures of phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll, concentrations). Closer inspection reveals that the detailed response is, however, not so consistent with the environmental trends. A significant decline in chlorophyll, concentrations occurred early on in the time series, before major reductions in nutrient availability. Correlation analysis revealed that this decline was associated with the re-appearance of Daphnia grazers. Further declines are only apparent in very recent years; correlation analysis and comparison of trends suggest that these were associated with the observed decline in nutrient concentrations. There was little correlation and no consistent relationship between annual measures of chlorophyll, and water temperature, but winter mean values did show a consistent positive relationship. Spring Daphnia densities showed an even stronger, and significant, positive relationship with spring water temperatures. It is clear from this that the scale of climate change predicted in the future will significantly alter the functioning of shallow lakes and seasonal patterns in water quality. This is a particular concern in Europe with the implementation of the EC Water Framework Directive, as if the net effect of global warming on annual measures of water quality is negative, the principle aim of 'good status' in all surface waters by 2016 will become even more difficult to achieve.

J	Yang, HJ; Wei, JH; Shi, KF				Yang, Haijiao; Wei, Jiahua; Shi, Kaifang			Hydrochemical and Isotopic Characteristics and the Spatiotemporal Differences of Surface Water and Groundwater in the Qaidam Basin, China	WATER												In the context of climate change, precipitation and runoff in the arid inland basins of northwest China have undergone significant changes. The Qaidam Basin (QB) is a typical highland arid inland area. Understanding the spatial and temporal variations in surface water and groundwater chemistry and isotopes, as well as their causes, is crucial for future water resource management and ecological protection. Samples of river, lake, and groundwater, as well as others, were collected and tested in five typical watersheds in the summer and winter. The hydrochemistry and isotopic spatiotemporal differences in various water bodies were studied using the significant difference method, water vapor flux models, hydrochemistry, isotopes, and other methods for cause analyses. The results indicate the following: (1) There are differences in hydrochemistry between the southern and northern basins because the southern basin is more influenced by the dissolution of salt rocks and evaporation, whereas the northern basin is mainly affected by carbonate weathering. (2) The enrichment of delta D and delta 18O in the northern basin gradually increases from west to east, while in the southern basin, it is the opposite. This is because the southern basin receives a larger contribution of water vapor from the mid-latitude westerlies, while the northern basin primarily relies on local evaporation as its water vapor source. (3) Significant differences are observed in the total dissolved solids (TDS) and hydrochemical types of river water and groundwater between the summer and winter due to higher rates of rock weathering and evaporation in the summer. (4) The more pronounced seasonal differences in hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes in the southern basin are due to higher rates of internal water vapor circulation in the summer. (5) The similarity in characteristics between river water and groundwater is the result of strong exchanges between river water and groundwater from piedmonts to terminals. The spatiotemporal heterogeneity of terminal lakes is attributed to the accumulation of salts and groundwater replenishment from other sources.

J	Katsanevakis, S				Katsanevakis, Stelios			Growth and mortality rates of the fan mussel Pinna nobilis in Lake Vouliagmeni (Korinthiakos Gulf, Greece):: a generalized additive modelling approach	MARINE BIOLOGY												The temporal patterns and the effect of shell size and depth on growth and mortality rates of the endangered fan mussel Pinna nobilis were investigated in the marine Lake Vouliagmeni (Korinthiakos Gulf, Greece). A total of 160 individuals were tagged and monitored monthly for a period of 17 months. At each visit, the size of the tagged individuals (shell width, w) was measured in situ and recorded. Any mortality event was also recorded and attributed to natural causes or (illegal) fishing. Growth and mortality rates were modeled with generalized additive models, which are non-parametric flexible models that free the researcher from the limiting concept of a strict parametric shape. The use of GAMs allowed the exploration of shapes of growth and mortality response curves in relation to predictor variables and allowed the fitting of statistical models that better agree with ecological theory. Growth rates had a seasonal pattern, with an extended period of very slow growth between late autumn and early spring, i.e., during the cold season, another short period of slow growth during August (when water temperatures reached their maximum values exceeding 29 degrees C), and a peak in growth rates during late spring-early summer, probably related to an optimum combination of temperature and food availability. Growth rates varied with shell size, with a peak at w similar to 4.5 cm, followed by a sharp decline to an approximately constant level, with sizes ranging from 9 to 15 cm, and a further decline with larger sizes down to almost zero for w > 20 cm. Growth rates did not vary substantially with depth. Although P. nobilis is a protected species in the EU and its fishing is strictly prohibited, fishing mortality was very high in Lake Vouliagmeni (much greater than natural mortality), especially during the hot season when the lake was crowded by summer visitors. The fan mussels were poached exclusively by free-diving and due to the high turbidity of the lake's water, fishing mortality was higher in shallow areas (and mostly for large individuals) and was practically zero at depths > 9 m. Due to fishing mortality, a size segregation of P. nobilis was observed in the lake: large individuals were restricted to deeper areas, while young and small individuals were more abundant in shallow areas where there was preferential recruitment. Natural mortality was strikingly size dependent and P. nobilis suffered high natural mortality during the first year of life; the probability of death by natural causes quickly diminished as the fan mussels grew in size. No depth-related differences in natural mortality were found.

J	Ward, DH; Reed, A; Sedinger, JS; Black, JM; Derksen, DV; Castelli, PM				Ward, DH; Reed, A; Sedinger, JS; Black, JM; Derksen, DV; Castelli, PM			North American Brant: effects of changes in habitat and climate on population dynamics	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												We describe the importance of key habitats used by four nesting populations of nearctic brant (Branta bernicla) and discuss the potential relationship between changes in these habitats and population dynamics of brant. Nearctic brant, in contrast to most geese, rely on marine habitats and native intertidal plants during the non-breeding season, particularly the seagrass, Zostera, and the macroalgae, Ulva. Atlantic and Eastern High Arctic brant have experienced the greatest degradation of their winter habitats ( northeastern United States and Ireland, respectively) and have also shown the most plasticity in feeding behavior. Black and Western High Arctic brant of the Pacific Flyway are the most dependent on Zostera, and are undergoing a shift in winter distribution that is likely related to climate change and its associated effects on Zostera dynamics. Variation in breeding propensity of Black Brant associated with winter location and climate strongly suggests that food abundance on the wintering grounds directly affects reproductive performance in these geese. In summer, salt marshes, especially those containing Carex and Puccinellia, are key habitats for raising young, while lake shorelines with fine freshwater grasses and sedges are important for molting birds. Availability and abundance of salt marshes has a direct effect on growth and recruitment of goslings and ultimately, plays an important role in regulating size of local brant populations.																			1354-1013	1365-2486				JUN	2005	11	6					869	880		10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.00942.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.00942.x													WOS:000229427600003

The dominant species, Ceratophyllum demersum and Myriophyllum spicatum, accounted for over 40% of total biomass. Only Ruppia maritima occurred across the salinity gradient. Salinity, water depth and clarity delineated 3 assemblages: a saline assemblage, and 2 groups of fresher-water species, one associated with deeper water and lower water clarity and the other associated with shallow water and higher water clarity. These assemblages exhibited intra-annual variation, with at least 5 times more biomass in late spring/mid-summer compared to early winter. This pattern was consistent across the estuary, although the difference between peak and low biomass varied by habitat type; brackish exhibited the greatest magnitude. This variation is likely due to higher variation in salinity and the species composition of this habitat. As climate change and coastal restoration impact timing and range of salinity, water depth and clarity in this region, these data can be used to help inform predictive models and management decisions.

J	Smith, SB; Norment, CJ				Smith, SB; Norment, CJ			Nocturnal activity and energetic condition of spring landbird migrants at Braddock Bay, Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												We investigated the relationship between migratory restlessness and stored energy reserves in two species of landbird migrants at Braddock Bay, Lake Ontario during spring 1999 and spring 2000. There was no significant difference in the amount of nighttime locomotor activity between lean and Fat Swainson's Thrushes (Catharus ustulatus) or While-chroated Sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis) held overnight in activity cages. We found no significant relationships between nocturnal activity level and energetic condition (mass/wing chord) or date of capture. In addition, there were no significant differences in nocturnal activity, levels between age groups in Swainson's Thrushes. These results suggest that the migratory restlessness of spring migrants stopping at this sire is not strongly influenced by their energetic condition upon arrival, regardless of age or date of passage. Birds nearing the end of their spring migratory route that are very close to their breeding grounds may show decreased levels of migratory restlessness and short stopover durations, independent of energy reserves. When stopping at northerly sites, spring migrants may therefore display distinct differences in stopover behavior and requirements compared to sites used earlier along the spring migratory route.																			0273-8570	1557-9263				SUM	2005	76	3					303	310		10.1648/0273-8570-76.3.303	http://dx.doi.org/10.1648/0273-8570-76.3.303													WOS:000236520300015
J	Ford, JE; Lonzarich, DG				Ford, JE; Lonzarich, DG			Over-winter survival and habitat use by juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in two Lake Superior tributaries	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Dramatic declines in commercial and recreational fisheries for coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in Lake Superior have raised questions about the natural factors that limit their productivity. Snorkeling surveys were conducted during the winters of 1995-96 and 1996-97 to estimate over-winter mortality and determine winter habitat use by juvenile coho salmon in two spring-fed tributaries of Chequamagon Bay, Lake Superior. Results indicated high densities of juvenile coho salmon in pool habitats of the two streams (x = 0.85 fish/m(2)) and high over-winter survival (>45%). Regression analyses revealed no significant relationships between fish distribution and physical habitat variables (large woody debris, overhead cover, and pool size). No shift in habitat use over the winter was found. These results contrast sharply with findings from the pacific Northwest where juvenile coho salmon generally occupy complex pool habitats during the winter. Although streams of the CI-eat Lakes region are similar in many respects to Pacific streams, differences, particularly in stream flow regimes, indicate that the early life history of coho salmon populations in these two regions differ dramatically. These observations may have important implications on the management of stream habitats in the Great Lakes.																			0380-1330						2000	26	1					94	101		10.1016/S0380-1330(00)70676-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(00)70676-9													WOS:000086696200009

CHEMICAL BEHAVIOR OF CHROMIUM, IRON, LEAD, MOLYBDENUM, MANGANESE AND ZINC IN THE SURFACE WATER OF TWO URBAN LAGOONS IN SANTIAGO, CHILE	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												Two water-bodies were studied: the Batuco wetland and the Caren lagoon, which belong to the Chacabuco hydrogaphic basin in Santiago, in the Metropolitan Region of Chile. Water and sediment samples were obtained at different times of the year: June 2008 (cold and rainy winter season), September 2008 (temperate spring season), and January 2008 (dry and warm summer season). It was determined that analysis of the distribution of trace metals using the conservative and thermodynamic behavior index would be an indicator of which metals were being added/removed to and from the surface water. The increase in Fe, Cr, Zn, Mn and Mo concentrations in the surface water of Batuco could be related to mineral dissolution and desorption processes from Fe/Mn hydrooxides. The decrease in trace metals, such as Cr, Zn and Mo, in the surface water of Caren would be due to adsorption and/or co-precipitation processes associated with the precipitation of hydrooxides. The presence of Pb in the water of both lagoons is related to external anthropogenic processes, since Pb was not detected in the sediment samples.

Seasonal variations of metal concentrations in muscle tissue of tench (Tinca tinca), water and sediment in Beysehir Lake (Turkey)	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY												Concentrations of 10 metals (Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) in muscle tissue of tench (Tinca tinca), water and sediment in Beysehir Lake were analysed using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrophotometry (ICP-AES). Tench is one of the most abundant fish species in Beysehir Lake. Metal levels were analysed in only the muscle tissue of the fish, because this provides information on the potential risk to the fish themselves and to consumers of these edible portions of the fish. The Cu concentration was the highest in all the samples of the lake's sediments and waters, studied in all seasons, and ranged between 24.01 mu g g(-1) (in spring) and 90.30 mu g g(-1) (in summer), but Cu concentrations in T. tinca were low: 0.03 mu g g(-1) (in summer) to 0.21 mu g g(-1) (in spring). Metal concentrations in sediments, waters and tench varied seasonally. All metal concentrations in sediments were higher than those in water and fish. However, all metal concentrations, except Zn, were lowest in fish muscle tissue.

Spatial and seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton groups and its relationship with environmental variables in Lake Okeechobee, USA	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												The concept of phytoplankton functional groups was used to assess phytoplankton community structure in an attempt to better understand their spatial and seasonal variation in Lake Okeechobee, USA. Samples were collected for analyses during summer and winter. 23 phytoplankton functional groups were identified among 102 species, of which 9 groups (H1, M, C, MP, Y, S1, J, X1 and X2) were categorized as dominant. Y represented by Cryptomonas ovate and H1, represented by Anabaena circinalis and Anabaena variabilis, were dominant in some sites in summer corresponding to higher temperatures. In winter, the biomass of the functional groups was dominated by chlorophyta group X2 corresponding to lower temperatures, and relatively high nutrients. Redundancy analysis (RDA) with Monte Carlo test revealed that water temperature (WT), TP, and TN were the most dominant environmental variables which influenced phytoplankton functional group distribution in Lake Okeechobee. Functional group H1 was associated with TN, pH, TP and WT. Similarly, functional group Y was significantly positively correlated with TN, TP and WT but negatively correlated with TN/TP ratios. This study reveals the importance of physical-chemical variables across a spatial and seasonal gradient, in structuring phytoplankton functional groups, and consequently in the assessment of environmental status of the lake.

The lake is inhabited by two morphotypes of land-locked Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), a sensitive indicator species for pollution and climatic impacts. The objectives of this study were to describe the trends in Hg concentration over time and to determine the relationship of climate to length-at-age and Hg concentrations in each char morphotype, as well as the relationship to atmospheric Hg measurements at a nearby monitoring station. Results for Hg in char muscle were available from 20 sampling years over the period 1990 to 2021. We found significant declines in Hg concentrations for both morphotypes during the 31-year study period. Increased rain and earlier freeze-up of lake ice during the summer growing season was linked to increased length-at-age in both char morphotypes. For the large morphotype, higher total gaseous Hg in the fall and winter seasons was related to higher concentrations of Hg in char, while increased glacial runoff was related to decreases in char Hg. For the small morphotype char, increased snow and snow accumulation in the fall season were linked to declines in char Hg concentration. The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and Arctic Oscillation were positively related to the large char Hg trend and Arctic Oscillation was positively related to the small char Hg trend. Significant trend relationships between atmospheric Hg and Hg in biota in remote regions are rare and uniquely valuable for evaluation of the effectiveness of the Minamata Convention and related monitoring efforts.					; Lehnherr, Igor/D-5707-2012; Muir, Derek/F-6183-2011	Kock, Gunter/0000-0001-7535-9411; Hudelson, Karista/0000-0002-4402-6056; 													0269-7491	1873-6424				NOV 15	2023	337								122466	10.1016/j.envpol.2023.122466	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2023.122466		OCT 2023						37689133					WOS:001097925400001

Juvenile fish were caged for 3 weeks in winter and in spring at selected study areas: Lake Vortsjarv, the second largest lake in Estonia, representing an agricultural and recreational area as well as an important fishing site, and River Suur Emajogi, whose main source of pollution is in the form of improperly treated urban sewage from the town of Tartu. To obtain an overview of the degree of contamination, the contents of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were determined in selected samples of fish muscle. During both seasons, cytochrome P-450-dependent monooxygenase (MO) activities in rainbow trout liver showed the highest values in the fishing harbor area in L. Vortsjarv. During winter, elevated MO activities were measured in fish in R. Suur Emajogi up to 3 km downstream from the town of Tartu, compared with the values from the upstream reference area. In the spring, MO activities at the same site did not reach such high levels as earlier. At that time, the contaminants in R. Suur Emajogi were much more diluted than in winter. This was due to the much higher runoffs and possibly causes the lack of induction. Conjugation enzyme activities did not show any significant changes in any of the studies conducted.

All study sites were dominated by alluvial pool and riffle channel form and the first two orders became intermittent during summer months. Nine benthos samples were collected seasonally from riffles and pools at each of five sites using a vacuum benthos sampler. Diel temperature pulse and coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) were measured at each site also. Water temperature was most variable in second order, and CPOM on riffles was not more abundant in upstream reaches. Annual average density and biomass of invertebrates were highest in third and fourth orders, respectively. Diversity was depressed in the intermittent headwaters sites. Macroinvertebrate functional groups did not exhibit strong longitudinal trends as predicted by the river continuum model, with species assemblages apparently more strongly affected by the segment-level physical template, although shredders were more abundant in the headwaters during fall and winter. This study indicates that a reach-level perspective based on channel form is a necessary complement to holistic stream ecosystem models, especially in alluvial gravel streams.																			0018-8158					AUG 8	1991	220	2					109	117		10.1007/BF00006543	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006543													WOS:A1991GK30900003

This study aims to evaluate the variation in drinking water quality of four major water systems (community tapes, open water channels, water storage tanks and traditional wells), in eight different villages of central Hunza, northern Pakistan. The water samples were evaluated for selected physical parameters and heavy metals (Ar, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Fe, Pb and Zn) via Atomic Absorption Spectro-photometer to detect any pollution sources and were compared with permissible limits set by WHO for any possible threats to public health due to contamination. The samplings were carried out during summer and winter season. The results revealed that certain physical parameters of drinking water i.e., turbidity of 44.79% samples, pH of 5.21% and electrical conductivity of 10.97% samples go against the WHO permissible limits and Pakistan EPA standards and on the other hand, Ar (30.25%), Cd (35.94%), Cr (80.85%), Cu (31.25%), Hg (98.56%), Fe (7.27%), Pb (50%) and Zn in 16.67% samples exceed the permissible limits. Kruskal Walis test indicated that most of the investigated parameters were significantly higher in summer seasons (except pH, Pb), varied with locations (except temperature, EC, Ar, Fe, Cr, Hg) and sources (except Cu, Fe, Pb, Cr). Source-wise means concentrations of toxic heavy metals were observed highest during summer season as compared to winter. Therefore, this study suggests that drinking water should be regularly monitored for heavy metals contamination in order to prevent excessive build-up of these elements in the human food chain, causing numerous ailments.

J	Li, N; McGregor, GR				Li, Ning; McGregor, Glenn Russell			Linking interannual river flow river variability across New Zealand to the Southern Annular Mode, 1979-2011	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												River flow constitutes an important element of the terrestrial branch of the hydrological cycle, yet knowledge regarding the extent to which its variability, at a range of timescales, is linked to a number of modes of atmospheric circulation is meagre. This is especially so in the Southern Hemisphere where strong candidates, such as El Nino Southern Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), for influencing climate and thus river flow variability can be found. This paper presents the results of an analysis of the impact of the SAM on winter and summer river flow variability across New Zealand, purposefully controlling for the influence of El Nino Southern Oscillation and the tendency for the SAM to adopt a positive phase over the last 10-20years. Study results, based on identifying hydrological regions and applying circulation-to-environment and environment-to-circulation approaches commonly used in synoptic climatology, reveal a seasonal asymmetry of the response of river flow variability to the SAM; winter flows demonstrate a higher degree of statistical association with the SAM compared to summer flows. Further, because of the complex orography of New Zealand and its general disposition normal to zonal flows of moisture bearing winds, there are intraseasonal spatial variations in river flow SAM associations with clear rain shadow effects playing out in resultant river flow volumes. The complexity of SAM river flow associations found in this study warns against using indices of large scale modes of atmospheric circulation as blunt tools for hydroclimatological prediction at scales beyond hydroclimatological regions or areas with internal hydrological consistency.

It is situated in the Corrib catchment. The lake has been managed as a brown trout fishery since the 1950s, initially by the Inland Fisheries Trust and more recently by the Western Regional Fisheries Board. The results from a number of studies carried out by the Inland Fisheries Trust and Fisheries Boards are presented, including the findings of a 1972 bathymetric survey; data from long-term monitoring of mid-lake samples for chlorophyll and nutrients, ongoing since 1975; a four-year study on phytoplankton composition and biomass (1983-6) and vegetation surveys carried out in 1975 and 1996, the latter as part of a study on littoral processes in the large western Irish lakes, funded by the Environmental Protection Agency. The findings show the lake to be a very shallow hard-water system with low levels of photoplankton primary production. Diatoms dominated the algal crop in the autumn-spring period with genera of green algae and dinoflagellates present in summer. The submerged vegetation was dominated by species of the genus Chara. Extensive reed-beds, dominated by Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. grew on sheltered and on east-facing shores.																			0791-7945					OCT	2000	100B	1					13	25																WOS:000166348200002

We used X-ray diffraction peak intensity ratios of minerals in the sediment layers ( quartz qz, plagioclase pl, amphibole am, mica mi) that are diagnostic for different source areas and hydro-meteorological transport processes in the catchment. XRD data were calibrated with meteorological data (AD 1800/1864-1950) and revealed significant correlations: mi/pl with SON precipitation (r = 0.56, p < 0.05) and MJJAS precipitation (r = 0.66, p < 0.01); qz/mi with MJJAS temperature (r = -0.72, p < 0.01) and qz/am with annual precipitation (r = -0.54, p < 0.05). Geological catchment settings and hydro-meteorological processes provide deterministic explanations for the correlations. Our summer temperature reconstruction reproduces the typical features of past climate variability known from independent data sets. The precipitation reconstructions show a LIA climate moister than today. Exceptionally wet periods in our reconstruction coincide with regional glacier advances.

Evidence of form II RubisCO (cbbM) in a perennially ice-covered Antarctic lake	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												The permanently ice-covered lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, harbor microbially dominated food webs. These organisms are adapted to a variety of unusual environmental extremes, including low temperature, low light, and permanently stratified water columns with strong chemo- and oxy-clines. Owing to the low light levels during summer caused by thick ice cover as well as 6months of darkness during the polar winter, chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms could play a key role in the production of new carbon for the lake ecosystems. We used clone library sequencing and real-time quantitative PCR of the gene encoding form II Ribulose 1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase to determine spatial and seasonal changes in the chemolithoautotrophic community in Lake Bonney, a 40-m-deep lake covered by c. 4m of permanent ice. Our results revealed that chemolithoautotrophs harboring the cbbM gene are restricted to layers just above the chemo- and oxi-cline (=15m) in the west lobe of Lake Bonney (WLB). Our data reveal that the WLB is inhabited by a unique chemolithoautotrophic community that resides in the suboxic layers of the lake where there are ample sources of alternative electron sources such as ammonium, reduced iron and reduced biogenic sulfur species.					; Kong, Weidong/H-7432-2012	Morgan-kiss, Rachael/0000-0003-4783-5358; Kong, Weidong/0000-0001-9682-1484													0168-6496	1574-6941				NOV	2012	82	2					491	500		10.1111/j.1574-6941.2012.01431.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2012.01431.x								22703237					WOS:000310261900023

The model has been applied to data for the River Swale, NE England, over a 1-year period (September 1993-August 1994). The data include environmental variables, chlorophyll a concentration and relative proportions (based on cell counts) of the major algal groups. A resuspension mechanism is proposed for benthic algae entering the overlying water column, which is related to suspended sediment concentration. During the winter period patterns in simulated chlorophyll a then match those in measured chlorophyll a although at a lower level. Results show that peaks in measured chlorophyll a during the summer are related to blooms in the phytoplankton and the benthic algae on the substrate. Further simulations indicate that the benthic community sustains phytoplankton populations during the winter period and enables their subsequent growth during the summer.

Impact of climatic fluctuations on Characeae biomass in a shallow, restored lake in The Netherlands	HYDROBIOLOGIA					5th International Symposium on Shallow Lakes	JUN 05-09, 2005	Dalfsen, NETHERLANDS					External phosphorus load to a wetland with two shallow lakes in the Botshol Nature Reserve, The Netherlands, was reduced, resulting in a rapid reduction of phytoplankton biomass and turbidity, and after 4 years, explosive growth of Characeae. The clear water state was unstable, however, and the ecosystem then alternated between clear, high-vegetation and turbid, low-vegetation states. A model of water quality processes was used in conjunction with a 14-year nutrient budget for Botshol to determine if fluctuations in precipitation and nutrient load caused the ecosystem instability. The results indicate that, during wet winters when groundwater level rose above surface water level, phosphorus from runoff was stored in the lake bottom and banks. Stored phosphorus was released the following spring and summer under anaerobic sediment conditions, resulting in increased phytoplankton density and light attenuation in the water column. During years with high net precipitation, flow from land to surface water also transported humic acids, further increasing light attenuation. In years with dry winters, the phosphorus and humic acid loads to surface water were reduced, and growth of submerged macrophytes was enhanced by clear water. Thus, the temporal pattern of precipitation and flow from land to water gave a coherent, quantitative explanation of the observed dynamics in phosphorus, phytoplankton, turbidity, and Characeae. Global warming has caused winters in The Netherlands to become warmer and wetter during the last 50 years, increasing flow from land to water of humic acids and phosphorus and, ultimately, enhancing instability of Characeae populations. In the first half of the 20th century interannual variation in precipitation was not sufficient to cause large changes in internal P flux in Botshol, and submerged macrophyte populations were stable.																			0018-8158					JUN	2007	584						415	424		10.1007/s10750-007-0608-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-0608-7													WOS:000246583500038

The rate of methane formation averaged 1,130 .mu.mol of CH4 per liter of sediment per day during late-summer stratification versus 433 .mu.mol of CH4 per liter of sediment per day during the early portion of fall turnover, whereas the rate of sulfate reduction was 280 .mu.mol of sulfate per liter of sediment per day versus 1,840 .mu.mol of sulfate per liter of sediment per day during the same time periods, respectively. The sulfate-reducing population remained constant while the methanogenic population decreased by one to two orders of magnitude during turnover. The acetate concentration increased from 32 to 81 .mu.mol per liter of sediment while the acetate transformation rate constant decreased from 3.22 to 0.70 per h, respectively, during stratification versus turnover. Acetate accounted for nearly 100% of total sedimentary methanogenesis during turnover versus 70% during stratification. The fraction of 14CO2 produced from all 14C-labeled substrates examined was 10 to 40% higher during fall turnover than during stratification. The addition of sulfate, thiosulfate, or sulfur to stratified sediments mimicked fall turnover in that more CO2 and CH4 were produced. The addition of Desulfovibrio vulgaris to sulfate-amended sediments greatly enhanced the amount of CO2 produced from either [14C]methanol or [2-14C]acetate, suggesting that H2 consumption by sulfate reducers can alter methanol or acetate transformation by sedimentary methanogens. These data imply that turnover dynamically altered carbon transformation in eutrophic sediments such that sulfate reduction dominated over methanogenesis principally as a consequence of altering hydrogen metabolism.					phelps, tommy/A-5244-2011														0099-2240	1098-5336					1985	50	5					1285	1291		10.1128/AEM.50.5.1285-1291.1985	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.50.5.1285-1291.1985								16346933					WOS:A1985ATS2200031

Seasonal habitat use indicates that depth may mediate the potential for invasive round goby impacts in inland lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												The round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) is among the fastest-spreading introduced aquatic species in North America and is radiating inland from the Great Lakes into freshwater ecosystems across the landscape. Predicting and managing the impacts of round gobies requires information on the factors influencing their distribution in habitats along the invasion front, yet this information is not available for many recently invaded ecosystems. We evaluated the seasonal habitat use and biomass of round gobies in an inland temperate lake to define the spatiotemporal scope of biological interactions at the leading edge of the round goby invasion. Using novel statistical approaches, we combined hierarchical models that control for imperfect species detection with flexible smooth terms to describe non-linear relationships between round goby abundance and environmental gradients. Subsequently, we generated accurate detection-corrected estimates of the standing stock biomass of round gobies. Our results show seasonally differentiated habitat niches, where suitable round goby habitat in summer months is restricted to shallow depths (<18.4 m) with a mixture of vegetative and mussel cover. We found high round goby biomass of 122 kg/ha in occupied habitats during the summer, with a total lake-wide biomass of 766,000 kg. In winter, round gobies migrate to deep offshore habitats and disperse, dramatically altering their scope for biological interactions with resident aquatic species across summer and winter seasons. The results of this study indicate that the scope of biological interactions in inland lakes may be seasonally variable, with potential for high round goby biomass in shallow lakes or at the periphery of deep lakes in the summer months. Such shallow-water habitats may therefore present higher risk of ecological impacts from round gobies in invaded lentic ecosystems. As round gobies expand inland, consideration of seasonal habitat use will be an important factor in predicting the impacts of this pervasive invader.					; Duskey, Elizabeth/LOS-4489-2024; Marcy-Quay, Benjamin/KFA-9607-2024; Rice, Aaron/A-1292-2007; Andres, Kara/AFH-2712-2022	Andres, Kara/0000-0003-4822-7047; Estabrook, Bobbi/0000-0002-5639-899X; Duskey, Elizabeth/0000-0003-0386-2821; Marcy-Quay, Benjamin/0000-0001-6141-9719; Karboski, Ellen/0009-0005-9352-2733; Scofield, Anne/0000-0001-6273-8084; Rice, Aaron/0000-0002-8598-9705													0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	2020	65	8					1337	1347		10.1111/fwb.13502	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13502		MAR 2020											WOS:000522308200001

Uptake kinetics followed 1st-order, enzyme-mediated, active transport. Mean seasonal maximum theoretical velocities of glucose uptake, measured at a depth of 0.5 m below the surface, were 6.38, 22.63 and 4.38 .mu.g l-1 h-1 dm-2 macrophytic surface area for epiphytes on Phragmites, Potamogeton and Nuphar, respectively, and 10.65, 57.00 and 18.63 .mu.g l-1 h-1 dm-2 for acetate removal by epiphytes on the same macrophytes. Mean seasonal maximum theoretical velocities of glucose incorporation, extrapolated to the mean macrophytic surface area available for epiphytic colonization/m2 of littoral zone and uncorrected for respiratory losses during in situ incubations, were estimated to be 15.92, 17.71 and 0.69 mg C m-2 day-1 at the Phragmites, Potamogeton and Nuphar sites, respectively. Acetate removal by epiphytes at the same sites was estimated to be 10.62, 44.01 and 2.22 mg C m-2 day-1. Turnover times for glucose and acetate removal ranged from 2.0-5.2 h during summer months under conditions of thermal stratification in the littoral zone. During fall, winter and early spring months, turnover times ranged from 5.3-132 h. Turnover times were inversely correlated with estimated maximum theoretical velocities of uptake. Approximations of maximum ambient substrate concentrations of glucose and acetate physiologically available to epiphytic bacteria on the 3 macrophytes varied seasonally within a range of 1.8-76 .mu.g l-1 and 0.4-379 .mu.g l-1, respectively. If community transport or substrate affinity constants are assumed to be 2-3 .mu.g l-1, or higher, field data suggest that natural concentrations of both substrates occasionally approach zero availability.																			0003-9136						1982	93	4					423	445																WOS:A1982NK08900002

Effects of Summer Drawdown on the Fishes and Larval Chironomids in Beulah Reservoir, Oregon	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												Summer drawdown of Beulah Reservoir, Oregon, could adversely affect fish and invertebrate production, limit sport fishing opportunities, and hinder the recovery of threatened species. To assess the impacts of drawdown, we sampled fish and Chironomidae larvae in Beulah Reservoir in the springs of 2006 to 2008. The reservoir was reduced to 68% of full pool in 2006 and to run-of-river level in 2007. From spring 2006 to spring 2007, the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of fyke nets decreased significantly for dace [Rhinichthys spp.] and northern pikeminnow [Ptychocheilus oregonensis], increased significantly for suckers [Catastomus spp.] and white crappies [Pomoxis nigromaculatus], and was similar for redside shiners [Richardsonius balteatus]. CPUE of gillnets either increased significantly or remained similar depending on genera, and the size structure of redside shiners, suckers, and white crappies changed appreciably. From 2007 to 2008, the CPUE of northern pikeminnow, redside shiners, suckers, and white crappies decreased significantly depending on gear and the size structure of most fishes changed. Springtime densities of chironomid larvae in the water column were significantly higher in 2006 than in 2008, but other comparisons were similar. The densities of benthic chironomids were significantly lower in substrates that were frequently dewatered compared to areas that were partially or usually not dewatered. Individuals from frequently dewatered areas were significantly smaller than those from other areas and the densities of benthic chironomids in 2008 were significantly lower than other years. Summer drawdown can reduce the catch and alter the size structure of fishes and chironomid larvae in Beulah Reservoir.																			0029-344X					AUG	2013	87	3					207	218		10.3955/046.087.0304	http://dx.doi.org/10.3955/046.087.0304													WOS:000325271800002

Direct observations of seasonal variations in groundwater levels, hydraulic gradients and water temperatures confirm that perennial springs and their streams are present in these small valleys. Estimated spring-fed stream discharges are low and variable, but continuous. Direct observations, grain-size distributions and bedload transport estimates indicate that significant transport of fine to medium sand occurs in all seasons. We present a process-form model for small-scale sapping processes. Stream terraces and paleo-meander scarps are being modified by sapping, and elongated valleys are likely being lengthened headward by groundwater sapping. Sapping processes have been occurring for at least the past similar to 4,500 years after Pigeon River adjusted to a fall in base level from the Nipissing high stand to the modern level of Lake Michigan. Sapping processes are currently producing a variety of small-scale landforms dependent on four main factors: 1) hydraulic gradients and spring discharges, 2) available grain size of material being eroded, 3) transport rate of sand bedload by spring-fed streams and finally 4) time available for groundwater sapping process to occur.

The bacterial community of a polyhumic lake, Mekkojarvi, was studied using DNA techniques and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis during the mid-summer period of water column stratification. According to the 16S rRNA gene clone libraries and length heterogeneity analysis (LH-PCR), heterotrophic bacteria dominated only in the oxic epilimmon, in which various Actinobacteria (mostly cluster acI-B) and Betaproteobacteria (especially Polynucleobacter subcluster PnecC) were common. Sequences assigned to heterotrophic, methylotrophic, photoautotrophic, and chemoautotrophic genera were all abundant in the oxic-anoxic boundary layer. Methylobacter and Methylophilus were dominant genera among methylotrophic bacteria. Sequences assigned to the photoautotrophic green Sulfur bacterium Chlorobium sp. dominated in the anoxic water column, in which the microbial PLFA biomass was 6 times higher than in the oxic surface layer. All PLFA-profiles were dominated by 16 monounsaturated fatty acids typical of Gram-negative bacteria, whereas iso- and anteiso-branched PLFAs typical of Actinobacteria were present only in minor proportions. The high biomass of the potentially autotrophic meta- and hypolimnetic bacteria may form an important carbon source for the whole lake after spring and autumn overturns; thus, the role of these bacteria in the seasonal energy mobilization deserves more study in oxygen-stratified humic lakes and ponds.

J	MacKay, MD				MacKay, Murray D.			A Process-Oriented Small Lake Scheme for Coupled Climate Modeling Applications	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												A one-dimensional dynamic lake model is presented as a candidate for simulating small unresolved lakes within the land surface scheme of a regional or global climate model. This model is based largely on well-established process algorithms with some exceptions. The complete nonlinear surface energy balance is computed in a skin layer of arbitrary thickness in order to ensure rapid response times with the atmosphere. Turbulent mixing in the surface mixed layer is achieved through stirring and buoyancy production as well as shear production along the diurnal thermocline. The net effect of Kelvin Helmholtz instability on thermocline structure is grossly accounted for by computing a linear temperature profile within a thermocline layer. The energetics of billowing is not considered; however, a significant thermocline leakage term is included. The model has been incorporated into the Canadian Land Surface Scheme and used to estimate regional turbulent sensible and latent heat fluxes over the Experimental Lakes Area in the boreal forest of northwestern Ontario-an area about 30% lake covered. It is demonstrated that the presence of open water has a significant effect on the net flux exchange with the atmosphere in this region. Sensible heat flux to the atmosphere is suppressed during the summer stratified period but enhanced in the fall, resulting in an increased accumulation of about 5% by the end of the open water season due to the presence of lakes. Turbulent latent heat flux to the atmosphere is more enhanced during autumn, with a final accumulation about 24% larger.																			1525-755X	1525-7541				DEC	2012	13	6					1911	1924		10.1175/JHM-D-11-0116.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-11-0116.1													WOS:000312628700016

Abundance and size change of Hannaea baicalensis in Lake Baikal	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												Hannaea baicalensis is a benthic pennate diatom that predominantly grows at depths of less than a metre attached to rocks and filamentous algae in Lake Baikal, Russia. This narrow zone at the edge of the lake is subject to frequent wave action and lake level fluctuations, which combine with other factors to affect seasonal abundance. During ice cover from January to May in 2008, when lake levels decreased from 42 to 14 cm above datum, H. baicalensis cell abundance remained low (0.39 x 10(6) cells cm(-2)). The main period of net cell increase occurred in autumn, when there was a period of stable lake level (+/- 10 cm changes in water depth) that coincided with the return of nutrients during autumn overturn. Cell abundance reached 1.52 x 10(6) cells cm(-2) on 31 October. Alongside the changes in abundance, cyclic size changes in cell apical lengths were found (40 to 144 mu m), which were associated with timing of the length of the life cycle. Size decline occurred in both spring and autumn, with an average decrease in apical length of 36 mu m per year. It took two years for the mean apical length of a single cohort to decrease from 128 mu m to 56 mu m, which was then below the threshold (< 65 mu m) for initiation of size regeneration.																			0967-0262	1469-4433				MAY	2016	51	2					149	155		10.1080/09670262.2015.1110860	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09670262.2015.1110860													WOS:000373496900004

Late Holocene change in climate and atmospheric circulation inferred from geochemical records at Kepler Lake, south-central Alaska	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Climate records during the last millennium are essential in placing recent anthropogenic-induced climate change into the context of natural climatic variability. However, detailed records are still sparse in Alaska, and these records would help elucidate climate patterns and possible forcing mechanisms. Here we present a multiple-proxy sedimentary record from Kepler Lake in south-central Alaska to reconstruct climatic and environmental changes over the last 800 years. Two short cores (85 and 101 cm long) from this groundwater-fed marl lake provide a detailed stable isotope and sediment lithological record with chronology based on four AMS C-14 dates on terrestrial macrofossils and Pb-210 analysis. The delta O-18 values of inorganic calcite (CaCO3) range from -17.0 to -15.7 aEuro degrees, with the highest values during the period of 1450-1850 AD, coeval with the well-documented Little Ice Age (LIA) cold interval in Alaska. The high delta O-18 values during the cold LIA are interpreted as reflecting shifts in atmospheric circulation. A weakening of the wintertime Aleutian low pressure system residing over the Gulf of Alaska during the LIA would have resulted in O-18-enriched winter precipitation as well as a colder and possibly drier winter climate in south-central Alaska. Also, elevated calcite contents of > 80 % during the LIA reflect a lowering of lake level and/or enhanced seasonality (warmer summer and colder winter), as calcite precipitation in freshwater lakes is primarily a function of peak summer temperature and water depth. This interpretation is also supported by high delta C-13 values, likely reflecting high aquatic productivity or increased residence times of the lake water during lower lake levels. The lower lake levels and warmer summers would have increased evaporative enrichment in O-18, also contributing to the high delta O-18 values during the LIA. Our results indicate that changes in atmospheric circulation were an important component of climate change during the last millennium, exerting strong influence on regional climate in Alaska and the Arctic.

Nitrogen speciation and phosphorus fractionation dynamics in a lowland Chalk catchment	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A detailed analysis of temporal and spatial trends in nitrogen (N) speciation and phosphorus (P) fractionation in the Wylye, a lowland Chalk sub-catchment of the Hampshire Avon, UK is presented, identifying the sources contributing to nutrient enrichment, and temporal variability in the fractionation of nutrients in transit from headwaters to lower reaches of the river. Samples were collected weekly from ten monitoring stations with daily sampling at three further sites over one year, and monthly inorganic N and total reactive P (TRP) concentrations at three of the ten weekly monitoring stations over a ten year period are also presented. The data indicate significant daily and seasonal variation in nutrient fractionation in the water column, resulting from plant uptake of dissolved organic and inorganic nutrient fractions in the summer months, increased delivery of both N and P from diffuse sources in the autumn to winter period and during high flow events, and lack of dilution of point source discharges to the Wylye from septic tank, small package Sewage Treatment Works (STW) and urban Waste Water Treatment Works (WwTW) during the summer low flow period. Weekly data show that contributing source areas vary along the river with headwater N and P strongly influenced by diffuse inorganic N and particulate P fluxes, and SRP and organic-rich point source contributions from STW and WwTW having a greater influence in the lower reaches. Long-term data show a decrease in TRP concentrations at all three monitoring stations, with the most pronounced decrease occurring downstream from Warminster WwTW, following the introduction of P stripping at the works in 2001. Inorganic N demonstrates no statistically significant change over the ten year period of record in the rural headwaters, but an increase in the lower reaches downstream from the WwTW which may be due to urban expansion in the lower catchment.

Fine slicing allowed a resolution of 3-6 years according to the Pb-210 dating, although it was still difficult to easily investigate the response to air temperature forcing, since extreme fluctuations in temperature occur on interannual time-scales. However, the resolution was sufficient to show responses on decadal and century scales. An overall tendency to warming in mean annual temperature in the Central Pyrenees has been caused by summer and in particular by autumn increases. Many of the measured sediment variables apparently responded to these long term trends, but the significance of the relationships was highly conditioned by the structure of the data. The variables responding most on the finer time scales were the microfossils. For diatoms, chironomids and chrysophytes the main variability correlated to summer and to autumn temperatures. For two planktonic species, Fragilaria nanana and Cyclotella pseudostelligera, we found a link of their variability with temperature fluctuations in their growing months ( September and October, respectively). This relationship appeared at a certain point during a general warming trend, indicating a threshold in the response. On the other hand, no significant changes in the dominant species could be linked to temperature, nor in any significant subgroup of the 180 diatom species present in the core. In contrast, for most chironomids ( particularly Paratanytarsus austriacus, Heterotrissocladius marcidus and Micropsectra radialis) a negative relationship with summer temperature extended throughout the studied period. This response of the whole group gives chironomids a more robust role as indicators for recording temperature changes on long time-scales( e. g., through the Holocene) and for lake signal inter-comparison. Finally, our results indicated that, in all cases, there was a significant resilience to high frequency changes and hysteresis despite extreme fluctuations. Although we were dealing with organisms with one or many generations per year, their populations seemed to follow the decadal trends in air temperature.

Short term sediment accumulation rates reveal seasonal time lags between sediment delivery and deposition in an oxbow lake	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Recent sedimentation rates are useful for quantifying how changes in a watershed affect soil erosion; however, typical geochronological methods for dating sediments are limited in temporal resolution, particularly for newly deposited sediments. We used sediment traps to measure short-term sediment accumulation rates in a natural oxbow lake whose watershed has a mix of agricultural and forested land. Precipitation data from a local Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) site and water quality measurements from Beasley Lake were used to explain intra-annual patterns in sediment deposition. We found that sediment accumulation in the traps was highest in July and August, while the highest rate of runoff, indicated by increased precipitation and total suspended solids, occurred in late winter and early spring (February-April). Our results indicate that the trapping efficiency of Beasley Lake may be lower than expected due to timing of particle settling predominantly in the summer months. The rate and timing of sediment accumulation in Beasley lake was highly seasonal and occurred when water temperature and pH increased, potentially through interactions with algal blooms. Our findings contribute new understanding of the interactions between suspended sediments, algal biomass, and water chemistry in a natural oxbow lake and provide support for using sediment traps to measure intra-annual variability in sedimentation rates in oxbow lakes.

The metabolism of ponds and confined coastal lagoons has been poorly studied in comparison to other aquatic systems, in which the metabolic dynamics are better understood. In this study, we described the ecosystem metabolism of two confined Mediterranean coastal lagoons located in La Pletera salt marsh (NE Iberian Peninsula), which is dominated by flooding-confinement patterns. We estimated the metabolic rates by applying Bayesian models to three years of high-frequency open water oxygen data. Our aim was to test if nutrients and other environmental variables (the temperature, conductivity, light and water level) that registered as important drivers of metabolism in the literature were the primary drivers of metabolic variation in confined coastal water bodies. We observed clear seasonal patterns in the metabolic rates, with extremely high oxygen variability during the summer season ranging from supersaturation (saturations > 200% were recorded) to anoxia (<5%). Despite the high rates of production registered during the summer, periods of anoxia could prevail for several days during that season. Thus, although the aerobic production and respiration were quite balanced in the lagoons during the study period, these lagoons are probably more heterotrophic since their anaerobic respiration has not been estimated. Because the studied lagoons are rich in nutrients, we expected a low response in the metabolic rates to nutrient increases, since the physiological response of primary producers to nutrient loading is usually low in nutrient-saturated ecosystems; our results supported this hypothesis. The temperature was the primary driver, highlighting the importance of seasonality in these highly productive ecosystems. Our results also showed an uncoupling between the metabolic rates, which were higher in the summer, and the standardized ones, after removing the temperature and irradiance effects, which were higher in the winter and negatively related to the conductivity. This finding suggests that potential productivity (standardized rates) is more sensitive to winter inputs and, in contrast, the actual productivity is more related to summer concentration processes due to confinement.

Modeling water quality and cyanobacteria blooms in Lake Okeechobee: I. Model descriptions, seasonal cycles, and spatial patterns	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Lake Okeechobee is a shallow subtropical lake that is critically important for south Florida agriculture and the Everglades. In summer, the lake typically experiences strong blooms of cyanobacteria including toxin producing Microcystis aeruginosa. To understand the dynamics of these blooms and water quality in the lake, a coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model based on the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) has been developed. The biogeochemical model was constructed to simulate major biogeochemical processes including nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycles, phytoplankton growth, zooplankton grazing, and microbial loop, among others. A three-year (2018-2020) simulation was carried out and calibrated with available in situ and remote sensing data for key physical and biogeochemical parameters. Although model and data generally agree in spatial patterns and seasonal cycles, significant discrepancies exist including exact timings of the blooms and dissolved inorganic and organic P concentrations. Model results indicate that Lake Okeechobee typically exhibits a two-layer circulation in summer with surface and bottom currents generally moving in the opposite directions. This feature couples with diurnal cycles of atmospheric forcing (winds and heating/cooling) and diel vertical migration (DVM) of Microcystis to strongly affect not only the spatial patterns of cyanobacteria blooms but also the bloom intensity in summertime. Horizontally, both model results and remote sensing images indicate that cyanobacteria distributions are concentrated in the central and northern lake during summer and in western lake in spring and fall, in responses to the prevailing winds. Consistent with previous laboratory and observational studies, model results also suggest that, among the two main nutrients N and P, nitrogen is likely the primary limiting nutrient for phytoplankton growth along the northwestern coast where dissolved inorganic nitrogen is typically depleted in summer. In the central and southeastern lake, nutrient concentrations are relatively higher, and light and winds are likely the main factors limiting phytoplankton blooms. In addition, surface winds and water temperature are important in regulating the seasonality of phytoplankton blooms. The model, however, is limited by the uncertainties of key biogeochemical parameters including the specifics of Microcystis vertical migration, and sediment-water interactions including nutrient fluxes and sediment transport. Nevertheless, with further development, this model can be useful for forecasting water quality and phytoplankton blooms and to assist in water management decision-making in the future.					; Hu, Chuanmin/AAB-9604-2021	Beckler, Jordon/0000-0002-1785-2352; jiang, mingshun/0000-0003-3338-6301													0304-3800	1872-7026				MAR	2025	502								111018	10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2025.111018	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2025.111018		FEB 2025											WOS:001426322600001

The polymitarcyid burrowing mayfly, Ephoron nigridorsum, adapts to extreme continental climate by undergoing egg diapause during the long and cold winter and rapid growth during the short and hot summer. We performed genetic analyses of the mitochondrial COI gene of E. nigridorsum from 10 local populations of the Selenge River basin in Mongolia to examine the historical population dynamics during the last glacial period. 2. We observed high overall genetic diversity and high intra-population variation. However, we could find no geographic cluster of haplotypes and no correlation between genetic differentiation and geographic distance within the river basin. 3. The long-chain haplotype network and multimodal mismatch distribution implied that the population size has remained constant for a long period of time. The Bayesian skyline plot indicated an expansion of the population size during cooling through the last glacial period and a stable population size from the post-glacial period to the present day. 4. Our results suggest that the Selenge River basin provided a comparatively stable habitat for E. nigridorsum during the last glacial period when the decrease in mean air temperature in summer (1-7 degrees C colder) is smaller than that of winter temperature (7-15 degrees C colder) according to botanical records. The mayfly has been probably capable of adapting to a more extreme climate - i.e. with a larger temperature difference between winter and summer - during the last glacial period by undergoing egg diapause, as montane and arctic species of cold-adapted aquatic insects have expanded their distributions and population sizes during this period.

J	Carcaillet, C; Richard, PJH				Carcaillet, C; Richard, PJH			Holocene changes in seasonal precipitation highlighted by fire incidence in eastern Canada	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Postglacial fire history has been reconstructed for eastern Canada from charcoal-influx anomalies from 30 sites taken from a lacustrine charcoal database. The reconstruction exhibits coherent patterns of fire occurrence in space and time. The early Holocene is characterised by high fire incidence. There is a major change to much lower occurrence slightly after 8 ka BP. A return to more fire appears after 3 ka BP. This sequence does not fit with the hydro-climatic reconstruction deduced from lake level reconstructions for northeastern North America, which indicates a dry early and mid-Holocene, and a wet late-Holocene. Fire occurrence however closely matches summer relative humidity inferred from delta(18)O. The differences between fire frequency and lake level history, are due to changes in the seasonality of precipitation and drought frequency. Lake levels are essentially controlled by winter precipitation while summer precipitation controls fire occurrence. The early Holocene before 8-7.5 ka BP experienced dry summers due to higher solar radiation and dry adiabatic winds from the residual Laurentide Ice Sheet. The middle Holocene was dominated by wet summers due to stability of the Atlantic air mass over eastern Canada. After 2.5 ka BP, summers became drier, albeit not as fire-conducive as during the early Holocene. Late-Holocene summers conducive to fire are explained by more frequent incursions of dry Cool Pacific or Cold Arctic air masses over eastern Canada.					; Carcaillet, Christopher/G-1218-2011	Carcaillet, Christopher/0000-0002-6632-1507; 													0930-7575					JUL	2000	16	7					549	559		10.1007/s003820000062	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s003820000062													WOS:000088495900005

Exposed at numerous locations in the valley side are extensive late Quaternary deposits, consisting of interbedded aeolian sands, fluvio-lacustrine units and palaeosols. Due to the importance of the location in potentially elucidating both summer and winter monsoonal regimes, and the quality of the sedimentary record, the region has a rich history of study, and yet even within the Holocene sequence, many conflicting interpretations have arisen based on studies on different sections. This paper aims to synthesize and explore these differences by exploring the lateral continuity of the Holocene se-quences along a similar to 45 km reach of the valley, and presenting new, detailed physical and geochemical analyses of three sections, focusing on the lacustrine Holocene Dagouwan Formation. The absence of the lacustrine unit at several locations confirms that rather than representing a single lake, the Dagouwan Formation instead represents a series of palaeolakes, probably at least partially hydrologically isolated from each other by aeolian sands. All begin with sand-dominated deposits during the early-/mid-Holocene, which is interpreted as the result of abundant sand-supply to the north and west, under the influence of an enhanced East Asian Winter Monsoon, and all switch to silt-dominated, more carbonate-rich deposits during the mid-/late-Holocene, which is attributed to an enhanced East Asian Summer Monsoon bringing loessic silts from the Chinese Loess Plateau to the east and south. The timing of this change, perhaps as late as 5.5 ka, supports the idea of a relatively enhancement late mid-Holocene of the summer monsoonal circulation in the region. However, despite the proximity of the sections and consistent analytical approaches, marked differences between the sections occur in all proxies studied. The timing and rate of the switch from sand-to silt-dominated lacustrine deposition varies between the sites by as much as 2000 years within just a few kilometres of each other, and at some sites the switch was gradual, whereas at others it was very rapid. Similar dramatic variations are also seen with organic carbon content, carbonate content, C:N ratio, and especially the delta C-13 isotopic ratio. These point to the lake basins behaving very differently, and emphasize that consideration must be given to the local geomorphology and palaeolimnological evolution of individual sections.					; qiu, mingkun/MSY-8724-2025; Telfer, Matt/K-7596-2015	Wang, Wei/0000-0001-6883-7390; Daley, Tim/0000-0001-5806-7310; Telfer, Matt/0000-0002-8562-7720													0031-0182	1872-616X				AUG 1	2023	623								111580	10.1016/j.palaeo.2023.111580	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2023.111580		MAY 2023											WOS:001057774500001

However, the transformation of arsenic (As) in response to these changes remains poorly understood. In this study, high-resolution dialysis was used to measure dissolved As in sediments from macrophyte-dominated (MD) and algae-dominated (AD) zones across different seasons. The relationship between sedimentary As fractionation and environmental variations was analyzed, and the As transformation process was explored. Results showed that the shift from macrophyte- to algae-dominated zones enhanced As release in sediments. Dissolved As in pore water of AD peaked at 120.36 mu g/L in summer, exhibiting the highest release intensity, while MD showed a notable As release profile in spring (34.92 mu g/L). In spring, decomposition and acidification of macrophyte residues, along with organic matter (OM) complexation, promoted the release of adsorbed As in MD. In contrast, reduction and dissolution of iron (Fe) oxides, along with competition for adsorption sites by dissolved phosphorus (P), drove As release in AD during summer. The high humification and low redox potential in MD sediments in summer promoted As-S co-precipitation, leading to As sequestration instead of release, this contrasts with the common view that warmer temperatures favor As release from sediments. The conversion from macrophytes to algae in eutrophic lakes may exacerbate the risk of As release, warranting further investigation.

Tree-length and cut-to-length harvesting systems were compared to a full-tree system on peatland black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) sites. The impacts of the various harvesting systems were compared by summarizing the structural and mensurational properties of the stands before and after harvest, by evaluating damage to residual trees, and by assessing site disturbance. The tree-length and full-tree systems, which were compared in winter harvesting, produced similar results. The cut-to-length system was compared to the full-tree system in both winter and summer harvesting, and protected substantially more advance growth, especially in the summer. Additionally, the cut-to-length system produced less damage to residual trees and lesser amounts of site disturbance. All harvesting systems resulted in or maintained residual stands with an uneven-size structure.																			0015-7546					MAR-APR	1997	73	2					249	255		10.5558/tfc73249-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.5558/tfc73249-2													WOS:A1997WY28600051

Nutrient, chlorophyll and zooplankton seasonal variations on the southern coast of a subtropical saline lake (Mar Chiquita, Cordoba, Argentina)	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Mar Chiquita is the largest salt lake in South America. Because of its rich and diverse biodiversity, it has been designated a world site of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. Despite its importance, its limnological characteristics are poorly documented. Here we report a baseline assessment of the seasonal variations of several limnological parameters on the southern coast of the lake. Samples were obtained at two lake sites (pelagic and coastal) and an additional site in the Laguna del Plata estuary lagoon. We found that Mar Chiquita is a well-mixed eutrophic shallow lake with significant spatial and seasonal variations in its limnological parameters. Of particular relevance are the spring turnover and the clear water phase in summer, being characterized by nutrient peaks (total nitrogen, total phosphorus (P) and soluble reactive P) in early spring, followed by peaks in zooplankton and ammonia in late spring and summer, together with a decrease in chlorophyll and pH. These events appear related to seasonal variations in water temperature and the shallowness of the lake that allows strong biochemical interactions with sediments. Correlations among the studied parameters indicate a significant role of zooplankton (particularly the brine shrimp) in controlling phytoplankton abundance. Laguna del Plata has typical estuary characteristics, including high variability in salt concentrations (13-63 g.L-1), high nutrient levels (0.48 mg P.L-1) (hypereutrophic) and higher phytoplankton biomass than the main lake. Mar Chiquita characteristics show interesting similarities with those recorded in the Great Salt Lake in the USA.																			0003-4088	2100-000X					2016	52						263	271		10.1051/limn/2016014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2016014													WOS:000383570500023

This paper presents a comparative analysis of hydrological characteristics of two river basins located in different climatic zones: the Wislok River Basin in the south-eastern Poland and the Chaohe River Basin in the northern China. The criteria of their choice were similarities in the basin area, main river length and topography. The results show that climate plays a key role in shaping fluvial conditions within the two basins. It is concluded that: 1) precipitation in the Wislok River Basin is more evenly distributed in the yearly cycle, while in the Chaohe River Basin it is highly concentrated in the few summer months; 2) spring snowmelt significantly contributes to runoff in the Wislok River Basin, while its role in the Chaohe River Basin is negligible; 3) in the Wislok River Basin, besides the peak flow in spring, there is also a period of high water in summer resulting from precipitation, while in the Chaohe River Basin there is only one high water period in summer; 4) the Wislok River Basin shows relatively higher stability in terms of the magnitude of intra-and inter-seasonal discharges; 5) during the multi-year observation period, a decrease in both precipitation and runoff was recorded in the two river basins.																			1002-0063	1993-064X				FEB	2015	25	1					1	12		10.1007/s11769-014-0673-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11769-014-0673-6													WOS:000351088100001

From 1973 to 2018, the annual mean air temperature increased by 0.05 degrees C/yr (seasonal Sen's slope). The results of a numerical model (R > 0.86) showed that the ratios of the air and water temperatures increased (0.71-0.77) in the rising limb and decreased (0.70-0.76) in the falling limb. However, the intercept values were 0.13-3.52 and 6.62-7.78 in the rising and falling limbs, respectively, and hence there was a 4-5 degrees C increase in temperature. In particular, in 2015, 2016, and 2018, the intercept values in the falling limb were >= 7, exhibiting hysteresis, whereby high water temperatures were slow to decline. Lake Paldang showed stronger water temperature hysteresis than its influent rivers and stream. The rising and falling limbs did not show a large difference in the extent of water temperature change (slope). However, the water temperature did not decrease rapidly, and the decrease continued for longer due to hysteresis, which is a type of inertia where the elevated temperature persists if the summer air temperature is significantly increased.																			1226-1025	2005-968X				AUG	2021	26	4							200177	10.4491/eer.2020.177	http://dx.doi.org/10.4491/eer.2020.177													WOS:000692092600013

Stable isotopes track biogeochemical processes under seasonal ice cover in a shallow, productive lake	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Biogeochemical dynamics under seasonal ice cover were investigated in the shallow (< 10 m) water column of highly productive Georgetown Lake, western Montana, USA. This high altitude (1,800 m) reservoir is well-mixed in summer, but becomes strongly stratified under ice cover (mid-November-mid-May). A rapid drop in dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration and rise in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration was observed after the onset of ice, with a corresponding increase in delta O-18-DO and decrease in delta C-13-DIC, likely caused by respiration (R) of organic carbon. Photosynthesis/respiration ratios (P/R) estimated from simultaneous measurement of DO and delta O-18-DO were near unity prior to ice formation but then systematically decreased with time and depth in the lake under ice cover. P/R in the water column was higher at a shallower monitoring site compared to a deeper site near the dam outlet, which may have been important for over-winter survival of salmonids. By March, the bottom 3 m of the water column at both sites was anoxic, with the bottom 1 m being euxinic. Elevated concentrations of dissolved sulfide, ammonium, phosphate, Fe2+, and Mn2+ in deep water suggest coupling of organic carbon degradation with reduction of a number of electron acceptors (e.g., Fe3+, ). The concentrations and delta S-34 values of H2S in the deep water and in the shallow water were similar, indicating near-complete reduction of sulfate in the euxinic zone. Late in the winter, an influx of isotopically heavy DIC was noted in the deep water coincident with a buildup of dissolved CH4 to concentrations > 1 mM. These trends are attributed to acetoclastic methanogenesis in the benthic sediments. This pool of dissolved CH4 was likely released from the lake to the atmosphere during spring ice-off and lake turnover.

However, few studies have focused on the fingerprint of antibiotic resistome in sediments affected by human activities. Here, we investigated the seasonal distributions of nine antibiotics and the fingerprints and health risks of ARGs, mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and potential hosts in sediments in the control, agricultural and residential regions of Baiyangdian Lake. The results revealed that sediments from the agricultural region had significantly higher concentrations of tetracycline, oxytetracycline, erythromycin and total antibiotics in spring than those in the residential region. However, ARGs of rifamycin (e.g., rpoB2) were the dominant ARGs, with the highest relative abundance in the agricultural region. The highest abundances of MGEs such as tnpA, IS91, and intI1 were observed in the control region, which presented higher relative abundances than the residential regions in four sampling seasons. Seasonal changes in antibiotic levels corresponded to significant variations in the relative abundances of ARGs, with concomitant changes in MGEs and potential hosts of ARGs. Meanwhile, 52.84 % of ARGs in sediments showed high health risk in fall. Moreover, strong correlations were observed between tnpA, IS91, and intI1, and ARGs of rifamycin. In addition to nonantibiotic factors (sediment organic matter, NH4+-N and NO3- -N), antibiotics (norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and roxithromycin) together regulated the ARG profiles in different human-disturbed regions, especially in the agricultural region in fall and winter. The findings provide new implications for monitoring and controlling the pollution levels of antibiotics and ARGs in lakes affected by intense human disturbances.

High intra- and inter-annual variability was observed and three additional bloom events were identified on 2003, 2005 and 2008. Hydrological and weather parameters were examined at different temporal intervals (August-October, September-October and monthly from August to October) to investigate the regulating factors of bloom incidence. Rather low temperatures and the persistence of clouds seem to facilitate starting and maintenance of blooms.

J	Serra, T; Pascual, J; Brunet, R; Colomer, J				Serra, Teresa; Pascual, Josep; Brunet, Ramon; Colomer, Jordi			The Mixing Regime and Turbidity of Lake Banyoles (NE Spain): Response to Climate Change	WATER												This study analyses the water temperature changes in Lake Banyoles over the past four decades. Lake Banyoles, Spain's second highest lake, situated in the western Mediterranean (NE Iberian Peninsula). Over the past 44 years, the warming trend of the lake's surface waters (0.52 degrees C decade(-1)) and the cooling trend of its deep waters (-0.66 degrees C decade(-1)) during summer (July-September) have resulted in an increased degree of stratification. Furthermore, the stratification period is currently double that of the 1970s. Meanwhile, over the past two decades, lake surface turbidity has remained constant in summer. Although turbidity did decrease during winter, it still remained higher than in the summer months. This reduction in turbidity is likely associated with the decrease in groundwater input into the lake, which has been caused by a significant decrease in rainfall in the aquifer recharge area that feeds the lake through groundwater sources. As a unique freshwater sentinel lake under the influence of the climate change, Lake Banyoles provides evidence that global warming in the western Mediterranean boosts the strength and duration of the lake's stratification and, in response, the associated decrease in the turbidity of its epilimnion.

Piscivory in recovering Lake Michigan cisco (Coregonus artedi): The role of invasive species	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Contemporary conditions in Lake Michigan where cisco (Coregonus artedi) populations are expanding are vastly different from those encountered by the historic fish community. Invasive species introductions have substantially altered the Lake Michigan ecosystem in the last half century. Successful management efforts for cisco in Lake Michigan hinge on our ability to understand their contemporary ecology, especially diet. We collected 725 cisco stomachs opportunistically from commercial fisheries (2%) and in agency surveys (98%) over six years (2014-2019). The majority (70%) of stomachs were from East Grand Traverse Bay and 96% of these were collected at Elk Rapids. Additional samples were collected from Charlevoix (8%), Little Traverse Bay (11%), other sites in northern Lake Michigan (4%), Central Lake Michigan (6%), and Green Bay (1%). Our results indicated a high degree of piscivory, in contrast to historical and contemporary accounts of planktivory for cisco in the other Laurentian Great Lakes. The top three prey items by mass were not native to the Great Lakes and these accounted for 87% of all observed prey mass consumed: round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) (58%), Bythotrephes longimanus (15%), and alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) (14%). Round goby dominated the prey in the spring and summer, while B. longimanus and alewife occurred more in summer and fall diets. The contemporary population of cisco in Lake Michigan has been able to uniquely capitalize on abundant invasive prey resources, which may be less limiting and more energy-rich than a more typical planktivorous cisco diet.

J	Schindler, DE; Rogers, DE; Scheuerell, MD; Abrey, CA				Schindler, DE; Rogers, DE; Scheuerell, MD; Abrey, CA			Effects of changing climate on zooplankton and juvenile sockeye salmon growth in southwestern Alaska	ECOLOGY												Detecting and forecasting the effects of changing climate on natural and exploited populations represent a major challenge to ecologists and resource managers. These efforts are complicated by underlying density-dependent processes and the differential responses of predators and their prey to changing climate. We explored the effects of density-dependence and changing climate on growth of juvenile sockeye salmon and the densities of their zooplankton prey in the Wood River system of southwestern Alaska. We fit dynamic time-series models to data collected between 1962 and 2002 describing growth of juvenile sockeye, timing of spring ice breakup, and summer zooplankton densities. The timing of spring breakup has moved about seven days earlier now than it was in the early 1960s. Our analyses suggest that most of this shift has been a response to the warm phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation that persisted from the mid-1970s to the late 1990s. This progression toward earlier spring breakup dates was associated with warmer summer water temperatures and increased zooplankton (especially Daphnia) densities, which translated into increased sockeye growth during their first year of life. The number of spawning adults that produced each year class of sockeye had a strong negative effect on juvenile sockeye growth rates, so that the size of the density-dependent effect was, on average, twice as large as the effect of spring breakup date. These results highlight the complexity of ecological responses to changing climate and suggest that climate warming may enhance growing conditions for juvenile salmonids in large lakes of Alaska.

Optimizing Selective Withdrawal from Reservoirs to Manage Downstream Temperatures with Climate Warming	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												Selective withdrawal systems can take advantage of thermal stratification in reservoirs to manage downstream temperatures. Selective withdrawal might also help adapt operations to environmental changes, such as increased stream temperatures expected with climate change. This exploratory study develops a linear programming model to release water from different thermal pools in reservoirs to minimize deviations from target downstream temperatures. The model is applied with representative thermal dynamics to Lake Spaulding, a multipurpose reservoir on the South Fork Yuba River in California with climate warming represented by uniform increases in air temperature. Optimization results for thermal pool management with selective withdrawal are compared to a single, low-level outlet release model. Optimal selective withdrawal hedges the winter release of cold water to decrease summer stream temperatures. With climate warming, selective withdrawal can help lessen stream warming in the summer but at a cost of warmer stream temperatures in winter. As numerous assumptions are made, particularly regarding representation of thermodynamics, modeling improvements are needed to further develop selective withdrawal optimization models; several improvements are discussed.

J	Yamamoto, Y				Yamamoto, Yoshimasa			Environmental factors that determine the occurrence and seasonal dynamics of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												This study investigated the seasonal dynamics of two populations of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae Ralfs ex Bornet & Flahault var. flos-aquae and four populations of A. flos-aquae var. klebahnii Elenkin in eutrophic water bodies over 1 year from February 2006 to January 2007. The growth of A. flos-aquae var. flos-aquae was promoted at high temperatures even if in one case the biomass development was very low when other co-occurring cyanoprokaryotes (Anabaena spp. and Microcystis spp.) were abundant. In contrast, the highest density of the other population of A. flos-aquae var. flos-aquae was observed in August when the population density of M. aeruginosa (Kutzing) Kutzing reached an annual peak. A. flos-aquae var. flos-aquae usually bloomed in summer but could also tolerate low temperatures in the winter, and was present in relatively high densities. The populations of A. flos-aquae var. klebahnii observed in this study can be divided into three groups based on preferred temperature; three populations increased in winter, and the other increased in summer. Large biomasses of the low-temperature-adapted A. flos-aquae were observed mainly during winter when population densities of co-occurring cyanoprokaryotes (Anabaena spp., Microcystis spp. and Planktothrix raciborskii (Woloszynska) Anagnostidis & Komarek) were relatively low or almost absent. The increase in or existence of Cooccurring cyanoprokaryotes during the summer resulted in a decrease of the A. flos-aquae population density. It was revealed that high temperatures (20-25 degrees C) are suitable for maintaining A. flos-aquae var. klebahnii strains isolated front the study ponds, implying that low-temperature-adapted A. flos-aquae can grow over a wide range of water temperatures. The high-temperature-adapted A. flos-aquae var. klebahnii co-existed with M. aeruginosa during summer; however, its peak population density was significantly lower than those in previous years when M. aeruginosa was absent. Overall, analytical results imply a possible adverse impact of the existence of other cyanoprokaryotes, such as Anabaena and Microcystis, on both varieties of A. flos-aquae; however, its mechanism remains unknown. Nutrient concentrations and pH had no clear impact on the population density of A. flos-aquae. Based on these observations, progress of eutrophication and absence of other cyanoprokaryotes are likely the key factors determining the future expansion of A. flos-aquae.																			1129-5767	1723-8633					2009	68	1					122	132		10.4081/jlimnol.2009.122	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2009.122													WOS:000266257300012
J	Osburn, CL; Morris, DP; Thorn, KA; Moeller, RE				Osburn, CL; Morris, DP; Thorn, KA; Moeller, RE			Chemical and optical changes in freshwater dissolved organic matter exposed to solar radiation	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												We studied the chemical and optical changes in the dissolved organic matter (DOM) from two freshwater lakes and a Sphagnum bog after exposure to solar radiation. Stable carbon isotopes and solid-state C-13-NMR spectra of DOM were used together with optical and chemical data to interpret results from experimental exposures of DOM to sunlight and from seasonal observations of two lakes in northeastern Pennsylvania. Solar photochemical oxidation of humic-rich bog DOM to smaller LMW compounds and to DIC was inferred from losses of UV absorbance, optical indices of molecular weight and changes in DOM chemistry. Experimentally, we observed a 1.2 parts per thousand enrichment in delta C-13 and a 47% loss in aromatic C functionality in bog DOM samples exposed to solar UVR. Similar results were observed in the surface waters of both lakes. In late summer hypolimnetic water in humic Lake Lacawac, we observed 3 to 4.5 parts per thousand enrichments in delta C-13 and a 30% increase in aromatic C relative to early spring values during spring mixing. These changes coincided with increases in molecular weight and UV absorbance. Anaerobic conditions of the hypolimnion in Lake Lacawac suggest that microbial metabolism may be turning over allochthonous C introduced during spring mixing, as well as autochthonous C. This metabolic activity produces HMW DOM during the summer, which is photochemically labile and isotopically distinct from allochthonous DOM or autochthonous DOM. These results suggest both photooxidation of allochthonous DOM in the epilimnion and autotrophic production of DOM by bacteria in the hypolimnion cause seasonal trends in the UV absorbance of lakes.					; Osburn, Chris/A-9339-2010	Osburn, Christopher/0000-0002-9334-4202; 													0168-2563					JUL	2001	54	3					251	278		10.1023/A:1010657428418	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1010657428418													WOS:000169863000002
J	Zimmermann, U; Muller, H; Weisse, T				Zimmermann, U; Muller, H; Weisse, T			Seasonal and spatial variability of planktonic heliozoa in Lake Constance	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Planktonic heliozoa were investigated at a mid-lake and an inshore station in Lake Constance (Germany) from April to November 1993. Integrated water samples were taken over 0 to 8 m and 8 to 20 m depth intervals at the deep mid-lake station and over 0 to 2 m depth at the shallow inshore station. Heliozoans were counted and identified to genus level in live samples. The following genera were identified: Actinophrys, Raphidocystis, Heterophrys, Chlamydaster, Choanocystis, Raphidiophrys, and Pterocystis. Small heliozoans (10 to 20 Fun, mainly Heterophrys and Choanocystis) generally dominated the community in terms of abundance. Large genera (Actinophrys, Raphidocystis) were, however, the major contributors to total biovolume. Total tell concentrations remained below detection Limits from April to mid-June. Maxima of up to 6.6 ind. ml(-1) were observed in summer; smaller peaks occurred in autumn. Heliozoan cell numbers were significantly positively correlated with chlorophyll a concentration close to the surface. Negative trends were found in relation to potential heliozoan competitors or predators such as rotifers and crustacea. Community biovolumes of up to 60 mm(3) m(-3) were recorded in mid-summer. The seasonal succession of the dominant genera was similar at both stations. The vertical distribution of heliozoans, examined on 2 occasions in summer and autumn, was positively correlated with chlorophyll a and temperature. We further studied the horizontal distribution of heliozoans at 8 stations across the northwestern part of Lake Constance on one occasion in late summer. Cell numbers recorded varied by a factor of 2. In situ growth rates of heliozoans were measured in diffusion chambers after the exclusion of larger potential predators at the mid-lake station on 2 occasions. Growth rates of distinct genera ranged from 0.06 to 0.59 d(-1), community growth rates from 0.3 to 0.5 d(-1). Based on growth rates and biomasses, we calculated the potential heliozoan production. Results suggest that during periods of their maximum abundance heliozoan community production is similar to average production estimates of ciliates and heterotrophic nanoflagellates. The seasonal mean heliozoan production is, however, equivalent to only about 1% of the combined ciliate and flagellate production.

Bradley; Stewart, Jeffrey G.; Simmonds, Robert L., Jr.			Direct observations of fish incapacitation rates at a large electrical fish barrier in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The electric barrier system in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal was designed to eliminate interbasin transfer of aquatic nuisance species between the Mississippi River and Great Lakes Basins. Electrical output was recently increased in an effort to more effectively eliminate the upstream migration of bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). Using gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) as a surrogate species, we examined the effectiveness of the barrier at incapacitating fish by placing them in a non-conductive cage and transporting the fish through the barrier. This experiment was conducted before and after changes in operating parameters. Higher electrical output increased barrier effectiveness by decreasing the distance required to incapacitation. Overall, 97% and 100% of fish became incapacitated at the lower and higher electrical operating parameters, respectively. Fish were incapacitated the soonest during the winter and spring, which was likely influenced by the reduced movement activity in the cooler months and the larger fish available for testing later in the spring. Moreover, effectiveness was influenced by type of boat hull material used during testing. Fish that were transported through the barrier along an aluminum-hull boat were able to swim nearly twice the distance into the barrier as those transported with a fiberglass-hull boat during the summer. The delayed incapacitations along the aluminum boat were presumably due to distortion of the electrical field caused by the conductive hull. These results raise concerns regarding the effect that metal-hull barges might have on the effectiveness of the barrier during navigation.

Filamentous cyanobacterial species dominated the phytoplanktonic compartment during summer. Bacterial numbers ranged from 2.7 x 10(9) to 9.8 x 10(9) cells l(-1), corresponding to biomass values of 35 and 119 mu g C l(-1), respectively. Temperature, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), primary production and soluble phosphorus were found to explain most of the variation of bacterial numbers and biomass in the system. Bacterial morphotypes exhibited a seasonal succession pattern with rods and vibrios as the most abundant morphotypes. Vibrios dominated during the bloom of cyanobacteria in summer, while rods were found to increase rapidly after the breakdown of the bloom in autumn and winter. Filamentous bacteria with cell lengths of up to 120 mu m bloomed during a short period in spring, making up more than 60 % of the total bacterial biomass. With principal component analysis we could extract 2 main factors influencing the variation of bacterial morphotypes, namely an abiotic/inorganic factor, containing temperature, oxygen, nitrate and ammonium, and a trophic factor, containing DOG, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and chlorophyll a. Variation of filamentous bacteria, however, could not be explained by these 2 factors. Bacterial secondary production amounted on average to 3.1 mu g C l(-1) h(-1) with a range from 0.5 to 7.0 mu g C l(-1) h(-1). The impact of top-down factors like grazing and viral lysis is expected to influence both the occurrence of filamentous bacteria and bacterial production rates. Enzyme kinetics of beta-glucosidase, leu-aminopeptidase and alkaline phosphatase were established and the relations to the other investigated parameters are described. By integrating the phosphatase and aminopeptidase activity into a phosphorus and nitrogen budget for the bacterial and phytoplanktonic compartment in the Alte Donau, we were able to show that there was no P limitation over the whole year, while N was possibly limiting at the beginning of algal blooms. On an annual basis primary production exceeded by far the bacterial carbon demand, but periods with the reverse situation occurred from October to May. Temperature and carbon supply were seen as the main factors for Limiting bacterial growth in the Alte Donau during the cold months. The importance of viral lysis and predation in controlling bacterial growth during the summer months was pointed out. A comparison of the investigated bacterial parameters with those of a mesotrophic but macrophyte-dominated branch of the same backwater system led us to the conclusion that the equilibrium shift of the Alte Donau has resulted in high primary production of the autotrophic procaryotic compartment but not in the expected increase of energy flux through the compartment of the heterotrophic bacterioplankton.

This study used automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) to explore the patterns of change in lake bacterial communities in three temperate lakes over 2 consecutive years. The study lakes included a humic lake, an oligotrophic lake, and a eutrophic lake, and the epilimnetic bacterial communities were sampled every 2 weeks. The patterns of change in bacterial communities indicated that seasonal forces were important in structuring the behavior of the bacterial communities in each lake. All three lakes had relatively stable community composition in spring and fall, but summer changes were dramatic. Summertime variability was often characterized by recurrent drops in bacterial diversity. Specific ARISA fragments derived from these lakes were not constant among lakes or from year to year, and those fragments that did recur in lakes in different years did not exhibit the same seasonal pattern of recurrence. Nonetheless, seasonal patterns observed in 2000 were fairly successful predictors of the rate of change in bacterial communities and in the degree of autocorrelation of bacterial communities in 2001. Thus, seasonal forces may be important structuring elements of these systems as a whole even if they are uncoupled from the dynamics of the individual system components.					; Kent, Angela/D-6124-2011; Yannarell, Anthony/AAA-1720-2019	Kent, Angela/0000-0003-1837-2382; 													0095-3628	1432-184X				NOV	2003	46	4					391	405		10.1007/s00248-003-1008-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-003-1008-9								12904915					WOS:000187875800002

During 2014-2015 sampling campaigns, we identified 126 taxa, of which 107 were identified at the species level and 19 at the genus level across 17 stations, with Insecta (87 taxa, 69%) showing the highest richness, followed by Clitellata (23 taxa, 18%). The dominant species Tubifex tubifex (15.87%), Chironomus riparius (15.60%), and Gammarus balcanicus (15.11%) served as key bioindicators, revealing significant organic pollution impacts, particularly in lentic habitats. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) for the summer period identified dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH as the primary environmental drivers, with pollution-tolerant taxa (e.g., Chironomus riparius) clustering in low-DO areas, while sensitive species (e.g., Baetis rhodani) were predominantly associated with well-oxygenated, alkaline conditions. Seasonal analyses demonstrated autumn as the most productive period (3,765 ind., 91 taxa), with Station 9 maintaining pristine conditions (BMWP score: 66, "Good") year-round. Conversely, spring showed the poorest water quality (BMWP < 25 at most stations), while summer exhibited intermediate conditions. Multivariate analyses (UPGMA, TWINSPAN) confirmed spatial clustering based on pollution gradients, with tolerant taxa (e.g., aquatic leeches, Chironomus spp.) dominating organically enriched sites and sensitive species (e.g., Plecoptera) restricted to high-quality habitats. Our findings highlight: (1) severe degradation at stations receiving agricultural/domestic waste (Stations 1-6), (2) the critical role of seasonal monitoring in detecting climate-driven stressors, and (3) the utility of macroinvertebrate-based indices (BMWP/ASPT) for basin-scale water quality assessment. The study provides a scientific basis for conserving transboundary freshwater ecosystems through targeted pollution control and habitat protection measures.

However, reports of active zooplankton under the ice indicate that other strategies also exist. This study was aimed at evaluating whether the composition of storage lipids in the fall differs between diapausing and active overwintering Daphnia. We assessed the quantity of storage lipids and fatty acid (FA) composition of Daphnia species, along with FA content of seston, in six boreal, alpine and subarctic lakes at the onset of winter, and evaluated the association between storage lipids and Daphnia overwintering strategy. We found that active overwintering Daphnia had > 55% body fat and the highest FA concentrations. Polyunsaturated FA, especially stearidonic acid (18:4n-3; SDA) and high ratios of n-3:n-6, were preferentially retained to a greater extent in active overwintering Daphnia than in those that entered diapause. Daphnia FA composition was independent of that of the seston diet, indicating that Daphnia adjusted their storage lipids according to the physiological requirements of a given overwintering strategy. The occurrence of an active overwintering strategy has consequences for zooplankton community structure, and can have important implications for the transfer of high-quality energy at higher trophic levels.					; Cusson, Mathieu/A-3026-2014	Cusson, Mathieu/0000-0002-2111-4803; Mariash, Heather/0000-0003-2822-5917													0024-4201	1558-9307				JAN	2017	52	1					83	91		10.1007/s11745-016-4219-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11745-016-4219-9								27981494					WOS:000393593800008

This predaceous cladoceran was previously detected in Lake Huron (December 1984) and subsequently dispersed into Lakes Ontario and Erie (autumn 1985). It was previously known only from Europe. Entry into Lake Michigan may have occurred through the exchange of Lakes Huron and Michigan water masses in the Straits of Mackinac. Bythotrephes cederstroemi was consumed by Lake Michigan deepwater sculpins in October 1986. Since Bythotrephes is believed to be a surface-dwelling species, the most probable route by which it entered the sculpin diet was through the rapid sinking of dying (and dead) animals and their subsequent ingestion by sculpins at the sediment-water interface. Bythotrephes cederstroemi exhibited allometric and cyclomorphic growth. The caudal process was relatively straight in immature specimens and became progressively more kinked in larger (older) animals. Furthermore, the kink was more strongly developed in autumn (October) than summer.

We attempted to establish migratory connectivity and flyway structure of the IUCN vulnerable Swan Geese (Anser cygnoides) by combining citizen science species' distribution models (SDMs) and feather stable isotope analysis. Locations Russia, Mongolia and China. Methods We established migratory origins and movements of 46 Swan Geese from five wintering locations by integrating citizen science SDMs and feather stable hydrogen isotope (delta H-2) measurements by linking feathers to precipitation isoscapes in a Bayesian probability framework. Results We determined multiple summering origins among Swan Geese from the most important wintering location, Poyang Lake, Jiangxi Province, China. As predicted, we found no evidence for sex-biased differences in delta H-2 measurements. Four geese tracked with GPS/GSM loggers all migrated to moulting areas, which confirmed the accuracy of our predictions from delta H-2 assignments. Differences between summering ranges inferred from historical and modern samples coincided with major wetland loss in northeastern China since the 1950s. Despite limited historical data, we contend that this supports the hypothesis that the summering range prior to 1950 was much wider than that of the current population. Main conclusions This was the first Asian study to establish migratory origins of wintering Anatidae based on stable isotopes and citizen science SDMs. We advocate the wider combined application of SDMs, telemetry studies and stable isotopes to investigate effectively avian migratory connectivity, as the results from this study provided important contributions to the development of conservation measures for this threatened and declining species in East Asia.

Cyanobacteria blooms have been observed in a number of tributary bays and threaten the drinking water security of residents in the TGR region. To identify the key factors controlling phytoplankton blooms in tributary bays and propose an effective management strategy, a one-year water quality study (November 2009 to October 2010) was conducted in Xiangxi Bay (XXB) of TGR. The results show that a rapid decrease in mixing depth is associated with the spring bloom, fading of the fall bloom occurs with the rapid increase in mixing depth, and an extremely shallow mixing depth is associated with cyanobacteria blooms that predominate during the summer. Development of thermal stratification in XXB is the major cause of seasonal variation in mixing depth and density current intrusion from TGR is the major cause of short-term variation in mixing depth. The seasonal thermal stratification of XXB is disrupted by sufficiently large water level fluctuations in TGR. The density current is lifted from mid-depths to the surface and chlorophyll a concentrations rapidly decrease in response. Based on these findings, a conceptual model is proposed for a management strategy to control phytoplankton blooms in tributary bays via controlled releases from TGR. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the areas of potential suitable habitat for Siberian cranes in Poyang Lake natural wetland were evaluated using 11 scenes of Landsat TM/ETM+ images. Habitat quality was assessed against six landscape indices. Results indicate that the optimum water level for habitats of Siberian cranes in Poyang Lake wetland would be about 12 m. Potential suitable habitat areas would be reduced from about 2300km(2) at 5m lake level to 530km(2) at 15.6m lake level. Landscape indices revealed that a higher water level would not be suitable for conservation of Siberian cranes. The proposed Poyang Lake Dam should be operated to control water levels for providing a favorable habitat condition for wintering migratory birds. It would create an unfavorable condition to the wintering habitats for Siberian cranes in Poyang Lake wetland if the dam would maintain the lake level higher than 12m in autumn and winter.																			1548-1603	1943-7226				NOV 2	2014	51	6					662	676		10.1080/15481603.2014.978126	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2014.978126													WOS:000346292400004

Presence and identification of Legionella and Aeromonas spp. in the Great Masurian Lakes system in the context of eutrophication	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Growing anthropopressure over the last several decades has resulted in rapid progressive eutrophication of the Great Masurian Lakes (GML) system located in northeastern Poland. In our studies, we investigated whether there is a relationship between the occurrence of pathogenic bacteria: Legionella spp. and Aeromonas spp., not explored so far in the waters of GML system, and the trophic status of the studied lakes. The GML system of glacial origin includes lakes connected by natural and artificial channels, and it extends from north to south for approximately 100 kilometers. Water samples were taken during the summer, subsequently spring and autumn seasons from 15 lakes in land-water ecotones. At all sampling sites, basic in situ measurements of physicochemical parameters were recorded. The amounts of chlorophyll a, nitrogen, phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon were also measured. The trophic state index (TSI) of the sampling sites was also estimated. The real-time PCR technique enabled the determination of the presence and abundance of Legionella spp. and Aeromonas spp. The results clearly showed that several environmental water quality parameters, associated with eutrophication, and among them: nitrogen, phosphorus, chlorophyll, ammonium concentration, conductivity, turbidity, water transparency, highly affected the presence and abundance of the detected pathogenic bacteria in the studied lakes. Special attention should be paid to the high impact of water eutrophication on the number of pathogenic microorganisms, which result both from human activities in lakes and climate change.					; Grabowska'Grucza, Karolina/KIB-2548-2024	Kiersztyn, Bartosz/0000-0002-8762-4873; Chrost, Ryszard J./0000-0003-4806-0179; Siuda, Waldemar/0000-0002-3306-9560; Grabowska-Grucza, Karolina/0000-0001-9170-019X													1129-5767	1723-8633					2020	79	1					30	42		10.4081/jlimnol.2019.1924	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2019.1924													WOS:000548063600003

The reservoir, covering approximately twelve acres, is retained by a 10.4-meter (34-foot) high, 183-meter (600-foot) long earth-filled dam founded on Jefferson City Dolomite of Ordovician age. The estimated leakage of approximately 12.6 liters/second (200 gallons/minute) resurfaced in the form of several springs up to 335 meters (1100 feet) downstream from the dam. Initial attempts at remediation were made to seal off at depth a swallow hole in the basin area approximately 90 meters (300 feet) upstream of the dam. A drill hole was advanced down the center of the swallow hole which penetrated solutioned dolomite and voids. Cementaceous grout slurry totaling 18.3 cubic meters (647 cubic feet) was injected via the drill hole into the swallow-hole feature. This procedure appeared to control the lake-water exfiltration at the time. The reoccurrence of leakage during the summer of 1996 when the lake level was at 3.7 meters (12 feet) below normal pool prompted the implementation of a geophysical natural-potential survey along the dam crest and its slopes during August 1996. The resulting six d.c. electrical anomalies delineated a pattern of interconnecting channeled fluid flow beneath the dam and its abutments. The two principal electrical anomalies, along the crest of the dam, were bracketed by five exploration/grout holes located on 6.1-meter (20-foot) intervals. One of the holes penetrated a solutioned zone having strong hydraulic conductivity between 12.96 meters (42.5) and 13.48 meters (44.2 feet) depth, within the underlying dolomite. The discovery hole and two adjoining holes penetrated the dissolved zone, where they lost 9.8 liters/second (150 gallons/minute) of circulation, showed a depressed, piezometric level and strong downhole acoustic emission anomalies. Dye injected into these holes communicated visually with the downstream rises. A total of 17.4 cubic meters (614 cubic feet) of cementaceous grout slurry was injected through the three grout holes and into the dissolved limestone. Within hours, the downstream leakage and springs significantly reduced in flow. This remediation resulted in complete stabilization of the reservoir to normal pool elevation. The amount of lake-water leakage terminated through the dissolved zone is estimated at 12.6 liters/seconds (200 gpm).																					90-5809-046-9				1999							253	259																WOS:000080195200033

Application of a robust design occupancy model for assessing fish recruitment	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Fish recruitment is complex, regulated by environmental factors that induce high mortality early in life. Additionally, age-0 fish can be difficult to sample, making recruitment difficult to detect. We used a robust design occupancy model to evaluate the effects of biotic (age-0 and adult common carp (Cyprinus carpio), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), walleye (Sander vitreus), and northern pike (Esox luchts) relative abundance, prey availability, age-0 carp length) and abiotic (water level, temperature) factors on age-0 carp occupancy, detection, and extinction in 13 lakes in South Dakota, USA, for July-April 2008-2010. Age-0 carp occupancy decreased with increasing adult carp abundance and increased with increasing water levels. Age-0 carp detection probability was high during summer (>0.75) but decreased in fall and spring (0.34). Most lakes were occupied in July but overwinter extinction probability was high (59%), resulting in 51% occupancy probability by April. Other environmental factors were not supported, suggesting they had little effect on reproduction and survival. Our results indicate reproduction was universally successful but difficult to detect and that overwinter mortality often resulted in recruitment failure.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				APR	2019	76	4					561	568		10.1139/cjfas-2018-0083	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2018-0083													WOS:000462361900005

We studied the bird diversity of century-old Pashan Lake (18.5344 degrees N, 73.7853 degrees E), Pune, Maharashtra, India, after 15 years of restoration. Pashan Lake is an overwintering site for many birds and recently went through a restoration event after eutrophication. Currently, the lake receives heavy sewage water and industrial effluents through a small river Ramnadi. The lake receives heavy monsoon rainwater, and in late winter and summer, hyacinth vegetation covers the entire lake surface. We monitored bird diversity (number of species with abundance) at Pashan Lake throughout the year (June 2021-May 2022) using the point transact method during morning and evening hours. We also recorded physicochemical parameters, including water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, salt, and TDS (Total Dissolved Solids). We calculated diversity indices for each season, Monsoon (June-September), winter (October-January), and summer (February-May). We recorded a total 81 bird species with the highest bird diversity in the winter season. Omnivorous and insectivorous birds dominate the fauna. Bird community recorded every month was clustered into two groups, June-November and December-May, suggesting the influence of hyacinth vegetation. Bird community was dissimilar among seasons. The study signifies the importance of long-term biodiversity monitoring studies for wetland conservation.																			0564-3295	2661-8982				DEC	2024	65	4					592	608		10.1007/s42965-024-00354-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42965-024-00354-9		MAY 2024											WOS:001222368100001
J	Zeng, ZX; Sun, JQ; He, SP				Zeng, Zixuan; Sun, Jianqi; He, Shengping			Comparison of the physical processes underlying heavy and light rain variations: insight from spring precipitation over Southern China	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												This study compares the physical processes responsible for the heavy and light rain variations from the perspective of spring precipitation over Southern China. The results indicate that, heavy rain variation has a closer connection with the western North Pacific anticyclone. Intensified western North Pacific anticyclone and associated warm and humid air transport, coupled with intensified East Asian subtropical jet, favor significant moisture convergence and enhanced convective feedback over the key region, which causes increased heavy rain rather than light rain over there. In comparison, light rain variation shows a close relationship with the anomalous low over Lake Balkhash, which causes lower-tropospheric cyclone over the key region. On the one hand, anomalous cyclone favors lower-tropospheric cooling; concurred with cyclone-induced increased moisture, the lower-tropospheric relative humidity increases over there. On the other hand, the lower-tropospheric cooling center shifts northward with height and causes enhanced atmospheric baroclinity over there. Such atmospheric conditions are conducive to the occurrence of low cloud and more light rain. In addition, intensified East Asian subtropical jet associated with Lake Balkhash anomalous low also provides favorable dynamic lifting condition. Moreover, heavy and light rain variations are more related to El Ni & ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation and North Atlantic horseshoe sea surface temperature in preceding winter, respectively. In addition, heavy rain shows a closer relationship with total precipitation amount variation, whereas light rain is more related to extreme consecutive dry days variation.					; Sun, Jianqi/A-7084-2016; He, Shengping/A-4084-2017	HE, Shengping/0000-0003-4245-357X; Zeng, Zixuan/0000-0002-0054-3449; 													0930-7575	1432-0894				OCT	2024	62	10					9951	9969		10.1007/s00382-024-07416-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-024-07416-7		SEP 2024											WOS:001312640800001

The Zit-Emba reservoir located in the North-East of Algeria, was constructed to provide drinking water, irrigation, and fishing. The vertical and seasonal distribution variation of cyanobacteria community associated with environmental factors was comprehensively investigated from April 2016 to December 2016 at five depths, based on a seasonal sampling. The cyanobacteria communities of this reservoir are composed of seven genera belonging to five orders. The average proportion of Microcystis to total cyanobacteria population was 43%, followed by Woronichinia 21%, Planktothrix 16%, Dolichospermum 13%, Oscillatoria 5%, and the remainder (Merismopedia, Spirulina) 2%. The average cyanobacterial abundance was 2702 cells/mL, ranging from 360 to 65 795 cells/mL and this abundance exceeds the alert level 1 throughout the year. The most recurrent periods of increase took place from spring to summer and autumn. However, the vertical distributions of cyanobacteria displayed a similar profile each season, and abundances tended to decrease with depth. The results of the statistical analysis suggested that the most abundant of cyanobacterial genera were positively related to chlorophyll-a and water temperature and negatively with the concentrations of NO3-N, NH4-N, and NO2-N. This demonstration of toxigenic cyanobacteria in this drinking water production dam involves regular monitoring of the cyanobacterial communities and cyanotoxins in raw water.

Relatively high levels of total arsenic (TAs) and arsenate (As(V)) were observed in hyper-eutrophic regions during summer and autumn, which is attributed to exogenous contamination and seasonal endogenous release from sediments. The distributions of TAs and As(V) were significantly affected by total phosphorus, iron, manganese, and dissolved organic carbon. Arsenite (As(III)) and methylarsenicals (the sum of monomethylarsenic acid (MMA(V)) and dimethylarsenic acid (DMA(V))), mainly from biotransformation of As(V), were affected by temperature-controlled microalgae activities and local water quality parameters, exhibiting significantly higher concentrations and proportions in hyper-eutrophic and middle eutrophic regions during summer compared to mesotrophic region. The eutrophic environment, which induces changes in the main water quality parameters such as phosphorus, chlorophyll-a, iron, manganese, and dissolved organic carbon, can favor the biogeochemical cycling of arsenic in the aquatic systems.

J	Pothoven, SA; Vanderploeg, HA				Pothoven, Steven A.; Vanderploeg, Henry A.			Changes in Mysis diluviana abundance and life history patterns following a shift toward oligotrophy in Lake Michigan	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												The abundance, biomass, and life history characteristics of Mysis diluviana were evaluated at a 110-m (offshore) and 45-m (nearshore) deep station in southeast Lake Michigan during two time periods, 1995-2002 and 2007-2015. Rapid changes in the lake's productivity were noted between the two time periods, including declines in chlorophyll, the spring phytoplankton bloom, the size of the deep chlorophyll layer, spring/summer zooplankton biomass, and the benthic amphipod, Diporeia spp., which historically served as a major source of food for fish along with Mysis. Mysis were more abundant during 1995-2002 than 2007-2015, with average declines of 82 % at the nearshore station and 54 % at the offshore station. One factor that may have led to declines in M. diluviana between the two time periods was altered reproductive characteristics due to decreases in food availability. Changes in reproductive characteristics included a shorter period of brood release during the spring and early summer and declines in brood sizes. Other characteristics such as growth rate and generation time did not appear to change between periods, however. Predation from fish appears to be focused on newly emerged juveniles and small adults based on the size of mysids found in stomachs of the predominant planktivorous fish in the lake. Despite declining planktivorous fish abundance during the 2007-2015 time period, M diluviana populations have not rebounded as in the past, indicating that there has been a decoupling between predator-prey in the lake following declines in system productivity and the loss of the alternative prey for fish, Diporeia spp.						Pothoven, Steven/0000-0002-7992-5422													1863-9135					AUG	2017	190	3					199	212		10.1127/fal/2017/1039	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/fal/2017/1039													WOS:000412040000004
J	Shimizu, K; Imberger, J				Shimizu, Kenji; Imberger, Joerg			Seasonal differences in the evolution of damped basin-scale internal waves in a shallow stratified lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The evolution of damped basin-scale internal waves was investigated using a modal analysis for layer-stratified rotating lakes. A simple model for homogeneous oscillatory boundary layers was incorporated into the modal analysis to predict damping rates of individual internal-wave modes, enabling the prediction of their evolution under wind forcing and bottom friction. Application of the method to Lake Kinneret indicated a different dynamic balance in summer and spring, despite the continuous presence of large amplitude internal waves in the two seasons. In summer, strong diurnal winds continuously excited the dominant Kelvin waves, but the relatively strong damping (e-folding damping times similar to 3 d) suppressed their amplitudes. In spring, wind forcing was again strong, but intermittent, and it was weaker damping (e-folding damping times similar to 10 d) that allowed the dominant Poincare waves to persist until the next wind event. The significant difference in the damping times was due to the difference in the periods and the structure of the internal waves as well as the bottom boundary-layer thickness, which limited the Ekman transport and energy dissipation within the boundary layer.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	2010	55	3					1449	1462		10.4319/lo.2010.55.3.1449	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2010.55.3.1449													WOS:000277650900039

Trophic Ecology of Nonnative Northern Pike and their Effect on Conservation of Native Westslope Cutthroat Trout	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Westslope Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi in Coeur d'Alene Lake, Idaho, have declined in recent years; predation by Northern Pike Esox lucius, a nonnative sport fish, is thought to be a causative mechanism. The goal of this study was to describe the seasonal food habits of Northern Pike and determine their influence on Westslope Cutthroat Trout in Coeur d'Alene Lake by using a bioenergetics modeling approach. Fish were sampled monthly from March 2012 to May 2013 using pulsed-DC electrofishing and experimental gillnetting in four bays. Northern Pike catch rates from electrofishing were generally low but increased slightly each season and were highest in the southern portion of the lake; catch rates from gillnetting were approximately 50% higher during the two spring sampling periods compared with the summer and fall. Seasonal growth and food habits of 695 Northern Pike (TL = 16.2-108.0 cm; weight = 24-9,628 g) were analyzed. Diets primarily consisted of kokanee O. nerka, Westslope Cutthroat Trout, and Yellow Perch Perca flavescens. Results of a bioenergetics model estimated that Westslope Cutthroat Trout represented approximately 2-30% of the biomass consumed by age-1-4 Northern Pike. Total Westslope Cutthroat Trout biomass consumed by Northern Pike (2008-2011 year-classes) across all seasons sampled was estimated to be 1,231 kg (95% CI = 723-2,396 kg), and the total number consumed was 5,641 (95% CI = 3,311-10,979).

The concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), calcium and sulfate in the interstitial water and the pH in the wet sediments of dimictic lakes were investigated during the spring circulation and at the end of summer stratification. Multiple regression analysis using the calculated diffusive fluxes of SRP out of the sediments and the morphometric characteristics of the lakes (reduced water depth), explained 73 % of the variance of the SRP-accumulation in the hypolimnia during summer stagnation. At the end of summer stratification diffusive fluxes of SRP out of the sediments increased and pH-values and sulfate-concentrations decreased at the sediment surface (0-2 cm) and in the hypolimnia. The maximum diffusive flux of SRP was calculated to be 5.8 mg/m(2)/d at the end of summer stagnation. Probable reasons for these higher diffusive fluxes of SRP at the end of summer stagnation are higher supply of labile organic matter and thereby higher mineralization rates, lower redox potential and thus higher dissolution of redox sensitive P-binding forms and/or dissolution of phosphorus being bound to Ca-phases at lower pH.

However, lake ice trends have not been well documented in Canada. Because of its size, considerable variability may exist in both freeze-Lip and break-Lip dates across the country. In this paper, results of the analysis of recent trends (1951-2000) in freeze-up and break-up dates across Canada are presented. Trends toward earlier break-up dates are observed for most lakes during the time periods of analysis which encompass the 1990s. Freeze-up dates, on the other hand, show few significant trends and a low degree of temporal coherence when compared with break-up dates. These results are compared with trends in autumn and spring 0 degrees C isotherm dates over the time period 1966-95. Similar spatial and temporal patterns are observed, with generally significant trends toward earlier springs/break-up dates over most of western Canada and little change in isotherm and freeze-Lip dates over the majority of the country in autumn. Strong cot-relations (r > 0-5) between 0 degrees C isotherm dates and freeze-up/break-up dates at many locations across the Country reveal the high synchrony of these variables. These results ire also consistent with more recent observations of other cryospheric and atmospheric variables that indicate, in particular, a general trend toward earlier springs in the latter part of the 20th century. The results of this study provide further evidence of the robustness of lake ice as a proxy indicator of climate variability and change. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Phytoplankton specific growth and loss rates were calculated over a 2-mo. period during spring circulation. Phytoplankton developed a spring Stephanodiscus and a late-summer Aphanizomenon bloom. Physical and chemical parameters, including organic and inorganic nutrient fractions, varied rapidly during bloom development and decline. Peaks in bacterial numbers developed immediately following collapse of both algal blooms, indicating algal autolysis and decomposition products as important substrates for bacterial growth. Net phytoplankton excretion was under 1% of 14C annual production. Due to low-over predation, large filter feeders dominated the zooplankton. The zooplankton seasonal succession was probably due to selective predation by fish, food availability and physiological differences among species. Calculation of phytoplankton growth rate constants, grazing losses, and other losses during the spring Stephanodiscus bloom showed that nongrazing losses (sedimentation, death and decomposition) predominated.																			0030-1299	1600-0706					1977	29	1					5	21		10.2307/3543288	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3543288													WOS:A1977DW06800002

Enzymatic control of manganese oxidation was taking place with a temperature optimum of approx. 30 degrees C. Manganese oxidation was only significant above about 19 degrees C. The temperature and season play vital roles in determining the extent to which abiotic and microbial mechanisms contribute to manganese oxidation. Results showed that microbial catalysis is overwhelmingly responsible for manganese oxidation in the lower epilimnion from November to May. Significant abiotic catalysis (up to 25%) can occur in late summer/autumn when the water temperature is greatest. Mn(II) oxidation, pseudo-first order rate constants to 1.12 x 10(22) M(-4). d(-1) were measured while poisoned sample experiments confirmed the role of biological mediation. In winter, biological control could not occur because of the lower temperature of the water column. The measurement of ''x'' in MnOx showed that higher manganese oxidation states were expected when the manganese oxidation rate was at a maximum and therefore when microbial activity was greatest. Direct microbial reduction of MnOx in the water column was of much less significance. However, indirect reduction may have taken place through the reaction of MnOx with sulfide. The results of this work have important implications for the design and operation of artificial destratification units for the control of manganese speciation.																			0043-1354					DEC	1995	29	12					2739	2745		10.1016/0043-1354(95)00156-F	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(95)00156-F													WOS:A1995TB43400015

It was found that the community was based on the period of high seasonal invertebrate abundance linked to the spring-summer proliferation of macrophytes and food was not limiting. Diet separations of individual fish species were high. In mid-July when 9 spp. were present. Schoener diet overlap values exceeded 0.25 in only 10 of 36 pairs of combinations. This contrasted with findings from a preceding May-June community of larval fish (Keast 1980). Mouth size helped channel the species towards different diets and diets of the early juveniles were distinct from those of the larvae, late juveniles and adults of their species. At both the species and community level, ontogenetic and ecological developments evolved in response to the opportunities created by an annually repetitive resource base.																			0378-1909	1573-5133					1985	13	3					211	224		10.1007/BF00000933	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00000933													WOS:A1985ALZ4600008

Estimated residence times ranged from 7 to 2348 days, which decreased from summer to winter. The nutrient condition was totally in a N-rich and P-limited condition compared with the Redfield ratio in both summer and winter. The estimated budget of DIN, DIP and dissolved silica (DSi) suggests that the ponds acted as a sink of nutrients to the downstream environment throughout the year. Fluorescence was clearly higher in the shorter residence time ponds. It suggests that cyanobacteria with relatively low chlorophyll content were dominant in the longer residence time while other phytoplankton was dominant in the shorter residence time. The opposite trend in residence time and fluorescence from August to December suggests that the dominant primary producer changed from cyanobacteria to diatoms.					; Onodera, Shin-ichi/A-9250-2018; Saito, Mitsuyo/AAE-5854-2019	Saito, Mitsuyo/0000-0003-3122-5205; Onodera, Shin-ichi/0000-0001-7709-8286; 													0144-7815		978-1-907161-39-1				2013	361						197	203																WOS:000323627500022

The biomethane potential (BMP) of submerged macrophytes varies depending on the seasonal changes in the lignin content of each species and the species composition of harvested submerged macrophytes. In this study, the seasonality of the chemical composition and BMP of three dominant submerged macrophytes species, i.e.,Egeria densa,Elodea nuttallii, andPotamogeton maackianus, were elucidated. The theoretical monthly methane yield (TMMY) and theoretical annual methane yield (TAMY) of the submerged macrophytes harvested from Lake Biwa were then estimated. The methane yields ofE. densaandE. nuttalliiwere 212-252 and 189-284 mL g-VS-1, respectively, while that ofP. maackianuswas lower, at 140-165 mL g-VS-1. Although chemical composition parameters, such as the lignin content, significantly changed between different seasons (p < 0.05), they range from only 7.8-14.6%. Therefore, the seasonal variations in the methane yield of the harvested submerged macrophytes depend on the species composition. The calculated TMMY of submerged macrophytes harvested from Lake Biwa was lower from autumn to spring (171-186 mL g-VS-1) than that in summer (213-231 mL g-VS-1) due to the predominance ofP. maackianus. The estimated TAMYs for several years revealed that a constant volume of methane gas could be obtained annually from the harvested submerged macrophyte.					; Koyama, Mitsuhiko/AEW-1089-2022	Akizuki, Shin-ichi/0000-0001-6403-7847; Ban, Syuhei/0000-0002-7168-5583; Koyama, Mitsuhiko/0000-0002-9136-1770; Toda, Tatsuki/0000-0001-9279-030X; Fujiwara, Masaaki/0000-0003-2207-8565													1939-1234	1939-1242				JUN	2020	13	2					683	692		10.1007/s12155-019-10082-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-019-10082-x													WOS:000553596800025

Seasonal changes in diet were investigated using volume, occurrence and dominance methods, which showed a mainly benthic diet in spring progressing to one dominated by mid-water and surface organisms during summer. Schoener indices indicated quantitative segregation during April which decreased during the summer as chironomid pupae and adults formed the bulk of the diet of both populations. Larger trout tended to eat fish. The results are discussed in relation to the diet of brown trout in other lakes.																			0035-8983						1985	85	5					57	71																WOS:A1985C846600001
J	Céréghino, R; Cugny, P; Lavandier, P				Céréghino, R; Cugny, P; Lavandier, P			Influence of intermittent hydropeaking on the longitudinal zonation patterns of benthic invertebrates in a mountain stream	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												The longitudinal zonation patterns of invertebrate species were studied in the River Oriege (Pyrenees. France) from 920 to 819 m a.s.l. At 912 m a.s.l., the river receives hypolimnetic water diverted from a nearby reservoir lake, and the natural flow may be enhanced several times a day front 1 to 11 m(3) s(-1) in summer and winter, and from 5 to 15 m(3) s(-1) during spring spates. During hydropeaking, the water was cooled in summer and slightly warmed in winter, but this was attenuated 3500 m downstream front the plant. Invertebrate densities were recorded in July (end of spates) and October (low flow period) at ten sampling sites : a reference site upstream of the hydrostation's discharge point (site 1), and nine sites each 400 m below the outlet (sites 2-10). The longitudinal distribution of invertebrate taxa was studied using Factorial Analyses, taxa and sites were clustered using Analysis of Dynamic Cluster. The hydroelectric facility did not clearly modify the qualitative composition of the benthic fauna, but clearly affected the longitudinal zonation of several populations. The low abundance of several species below the outlet reflected the impact of both hydropeaking and zonation. These species were high mountain species, the density of which decreases towards downstream sites in the Pyrenees, and low mountain species, the density of which naturally decreases towards upstream sites. Some taxa disappeared in the regulated section, so their distribution in the River Oriege was primarily influenced by hydropeaking. Finally. some taxa preferentially lived in the lower section of the river where the impact of peaking flows was strongly attenuated, so their longitudinal distribution was first governed by their natural longitudinal zonation. Under this kind of river regulation (natural discharge and temperature except during periods of power generation, intermittent hydropeaking from a separate reservoir) modifications of the thermal regime had a minor effect on the population dynamics, unlike hydraulic disturbances which strongly influenced the structural attributes of benthic communities.					; CEREGHINO, Regis/G-9500-2011	Cereghino, Regis/0000-0003-3981-3159; 													1434-2944						2002	87	1					47	60		10.1002/1522-2632(200201)87:1<47::AID-IROH47>3.0.CO;2-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1522-2632(200201)87:1<47::AID-IROH47>3.0.CO;2-9													WOS:000173875500004

Watershed retention was higher for H+, but negative for other elements as a consequence of isostatic rebound. Annual element runoff was a function of the timing of melt runoff and summer rain events because of permafrost. Lake retention of Si was higher than P because of the different times of loading, late summer versus spring. Conservative element mass did not change overwinter except in low-elevation Spring Lake, where residual Cl, Na, and K diffused from the sediments. Phosphorus and N were the only elements incorporated into black ice. As a result of freezeout and incomplete meltwater mixing beneath lake ice, element concentrations were 1.6 times higher in lakes than inflows, and major ion turnover times were 1.5-2.0 times higher than water turnover times.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JUN	1986	43	6					1104	+		10.1139/f86-140	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f86-140													WOS:A1986C625200001

The composition and seasonal variation were investigated. The diffusive air-water exchange flux was estimated by a two-film model, and the uncertainty in the flux calculations and the sensitivity of the parameters were evaluated. The following results were obtained: (1) the average residual levels of all PAHs (PAH16) in the atmosphere from Lake Chaohu were 60.85 +/- 46.17 ng m-3 in the gaseous phase and 14.32 +/- 23.82 ng m(-3) in the particulate phase. The dissolved PAH16 level was 173.46 +/- 132.89 ng L-1. (2) The seasonal variation of average PAH16 contents ranged from 43.09 +/- 33.20 ng m(-3) (summer) to 137.47 +/- 41.69 ng m(-3) (winter) in gaseous phase, from 6.62 +/- 2.72 ng m(-3) (summer) to 56.13 +/- 22.99 ng m(-3) (winter) in particulate phase, and 142.68 +/- 74.68 ng L-1 (winter) to 360.00 +/- 176.60 ng L-1 (summer) in water samples. Obvious seasonal trends of PAH16 concentrations were found in the atmosphere and water. The values of PAH16 for both the atmosphere and the water were significantly correlated with temperature. (3) The monthly diffusive air-water exchange flux of total PAH16 ranged from -1.77 x 10(4) ng m(-2) d(-1) to 1.11 x 10(5) ng m(-2) d(-1), with an average value of 3.45 x 10(4) ng m(-2) d(-1). (4) The results of a Monte Carlo simulation showed that the monthly average PAH fluxes ranged from -3.4 x 10(3) ng m(-2) d(-1) to 1.6 x 10(4) ng m(-2) d(-1) throughout the year, and the uncertainties for individual PAHs were compared. (5) According to the sensitivity analysis, the concentrations of dissolved and gaseous phase PAHs were the two most important factors affecting the results of the flux calculations.

J	Yang, JR; Pick, FR; Hamilton, PB				Yang, JR; Pick, FR; Hamilton, PB			Changes in the planktonic diatom flora of a large mountain lake in response to fertilization	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												Fertilization (phosphorus and nitrogen) of Kootenay Lake, British Columbia, was begun in 1992 in an attempt to increase food resources for declining stocks of kokanee salmon. In 1992 and 1993, significant changes in diatom abundance, species composition, diversity and morphology of individual species were observed in the fertilized North Arm in comparison to the unfertilized South Arm. Effects of fertilization were most obvious during the spring. During summer stratification, fertilization did not result in significant changes in total abundance, but changes in species composition were observed. In 1993, with continued fertilization of the North Arm, diatom abundance in both spring and summer was significantly higher than at the same sites in 1992. No significant differences were observed in the unfertilized South Arm. Diatom abundance was significantly correlated with dissolved inorganic nitrogen (positive) and dissolved reactive silica (negative). Diatom assemblages in the fertilized North Arm in both the Spring and summer of 1993 were dominated by Asterionella formosa and Fragilaria crotonensis, taxa considered mesotrophic. Abundance of the oligotrophic taxa Rhizosolenia eriensis and Cyclotella michiganiana was higher in the South Arm than in the North Arm. Differences in diatom assemblages between the two arms in both pears were furthur summarized by multivariate statistical analyses. Morphological variations in two small Cyclotella species (C. comensis and C. cf: pseudostelligera) were observed between the fertilized and ''control'' stations. Populations of both species from fertilized stations exhibited stranger silicification with coarser striations and a smaller mean size.

Comparative ecologies of domestic and naturalised rainbow trout in northern Lake Huron	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Northern Lake Huron (Ontario, Canada) supports the largest concentration of freshwater salmonid cage culture farms in Canada and receives inputs of domestic-strain rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) through escapement. We assessed the potential effects of these domestic fish on the naturalised rainbow trout of this ecosystem by comparing their respective ecologies. Mature adults were sampled from spawning tributaries, primarily in spring, and to a lesser extent in fall. Fish of domestic origin comprised similar to 80% of rainbow trout sampled from sites near cage culture facilities but <20% of rainbow trout sampled from more distant sites. Domestic adults in spawning condition (gametes free-flowing) were present in the spawning tributaries in both spring and fall sampling seasons, whereas naturalised fish in spawning condition were only observed in the spring. Domestic adults were younger and smaller (in length), appeared to have shorter lifespan and had a higher male to female ratio compared with their naturalised counterparts. Growth rates (change in length with age) of naturalised and domestic females in the wild were similar, but domestic males grew more slowly than naturalised males. Domestic females also produced smaller eggs than naturalised females. Food web positions (inferred from C-13 and N-15) of domestic and naturalised fish were very similar but varied more strongly with body size in the former. Domestic-strain rainbow trout of cage culture origin can survive, grow and attempt to spawn in northern Lake Huron and have the potential to compete for food, mates and spawning habitat with naturalised rainbow trout.

Biological and chemical redox transformations of mercury in fresh and salt waters of the high arctic during spring and summer	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												It is well-established that atmospheric deposition transports Hg to Arctic regions, but the postdepositional dynamics of Hg that can alter its impact on Arctic food chains are less understood. Through a series of in situ experiments, we investigated the redox transformations of Hg in coastal and inland aquatic systems. During spring and summer, Hg reduction in streams and pond waters decreased across a 4-fold increase in salinity. This alteration of Hg reduction due to chloride was counterbalanced by the presence of particles, which favored the conversion of oxidized Hg to its elemental form. In saline waters, biogenic organic materials, produced by algae, were able to promote oxidation of Hg(0) even under dark conditions. Overall these results point to the vulnerability of marine/coastal Arctic systems to Hg, compared to inland systems, with oxidation processes enhancing Hg residence times and thus increasing its potential to enter the food chain.

J	Stancill, W; Jordan, GR; Paukert, CP				Stancill, W; Jordan, GR; Paukert, CP			Seasonal migration patterns and site fidelity of adult paddlefish in Lake Francis Case, Missouri River	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We used ultrasonic telemetry to determine the distribution, seasonal migration patterns, and site fidelity of adult paddlefish Polyodon spathula in a main-stem Missouri River impoundment. Thirty-two adult paddlefish collected from two different spring congregation areas in Lake Francis Case, South Dakota. were surgically implanted with ultrasonic tags and relocated monthly from March to November 1994-1996. Paddlefish tagged in the Big Bend tailwaters were captured in this area and in another possible spring congregation (the White River) during pre-spawning and spawning periods, whereas paddlefish tagged in the White River were never located in the Big Bend tailwaters or in areas above the White River. Male and female paddlefish used reservoir habitats similarly except during the pre-spawning period, when male paddlefish used the White River more than would be expected by chance and all females implanted at the White River site remained below the White River. In both the postspawning and winter periods, all paddlefish moved downstream and congregated in the lower reservoir reaches. Up to 62% of males and 36% of females returned to their original capture site during the presumed spawning period at least 1 of the 2 years after tagging, Thirty-one percent of mates at large for 2 years returned to their initial spring capture location each of the following years, but only 9% of females returned. Our results indicate that some paddlefish exhibited site fidelity to the areas where they were captured (i.e., the White River) and presumably attempted to spawn. although winter distribution was similar among all tagged paddlefish. Restoration and stocking efforts may need to focus on habitat management at the locations where paddlefish may spawn, given adequate substrate.

To date, the variability of the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) and its controlling factors is still unclear in downwind areas that experience the Siberian High, mostly due to the lack of a high-resolution winter monsoon index. Based on the correlation between diatom variations in a volcanic cone of Jeju Island, South Korea, with past regional climate changes (e.g., temperature, dust, and sea ice) and solar activity, in this study, we evaluated the changes in the climate from the sum of acidophilous species (SAS), known to be mainly controlled by the pH of the prevalent water pool, and inferred that the SAS increased during the cold and dry periods (e.g., Little Ice Age and Dark Age Cold Period). Furthermore, millennial-timescale fluctuation in the detrended SAS during the past 8000 years, with peaks at similar to 500, 1500, 3000, 5600, 6600, and 7600 cal yr B.P., corresponded to the ice-rafted events reported from studies conducted on subpolar ocean sediments and solar activity. In this study, we suggest that, historically, high-latitude climate change driven by solar activity has controlled the EAWM; additionally, we support the application of the SAS in Jeju Island as a high-resolution EAWM index.

Since 2002. 76,547 Lahontan cutthroat trout have been reintroduced into Fallen Leaf Lake, California; we used creel surveys. diet data, mark-recapture methods. bioenergetics modeling, and netting data across seasons to evaluate the habitat use, growth, and relative abundance of Lahontan cutthroat trout and the abundance. diet. habitat use, and predation by nonnative species. Sampling totals (n = 2) and survey observations (n = 3) indicate low survival and abundance of reintroduced fish and together with creel data indicate the importance of epilimnetic habitats across size-classes. Despite substantial growth. Lahontan cutthroat trout exhibited low condition factor values (average = 0.69). We found substantial predation pressure front a large population of lake trout Salvelinus namaycush ((N) over cap = 8.799 fish: 95% confidence interval [CI] 4,990-16,530 fish): analysis of lake trout diets showed an increase in piscivory and in the percentage of stomachs containing Lahontan cutthroat trout anchor tags with increasing predator size. Overall. we estimated that lake trout consumed over 38% of reintroduced Lahontan cutthroat trout (mean number consumed = 7,736 Fish: 95% CI = 4,388-14,534 fish). With bioenergetics modeling, however. we estimated that lake trout consumed considerable amounts of salmonid biomass during this period (mean biomass = 3,137 kg: 95% Cl = 1 779 5,993 kg), which greatly exceeded the biomass of Lahontan cutthroat trout reintroduced in 2006. During the stratification period, there was little overlap in habitat use between lake trout and Lahontan cutthroat trout, but overlap was high during the spring and autumn. We found moderate-sized populations of nonnative brown trout Salmo trutta, kokanee O. nerka (lacustrine sockeye salmon), and rainbow trout O. mykiss. Together, our results suggest that Lahontan Cutthroat trout have few refugia front direct and indirect negative interactions with normative species and that alternative approaches are needed.

In this study, a total of 79 sediment samples were collected from four representative habitat types (duck farm, fish farm, lotus pond and residential area) and one reference site (conservation district) of Baiyangdian Lake, North China, in three seasons (winter, spring and summer). The physical and chemical properties and the levels of contaminants in sediment were determined. Bacterial communities were studied by 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing techniques. The result showed that, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria were the dominant species at the phylum level in Baiyangdian. Sulfuricurvum, Thiobacillus Dechloromonas, Sulfurovum, Nitrospira and Desulfatiglans were the dominant species at the genus level. The dominant genus was different among different habitats. Proteobacteria exhibited the highest relative abundance in all seasons, and the relative abundance of dominant bacteria was highest in winter. The main functional group from the sampling sites were contamination tolerance bacteria, such as sulfur-oxidizing, sulfate-reducing and nitrifying bacteria. Sulfur-oxidizing bacteria were found mainly in duck farms and residential areas, whereas sulfate-reducing bacteria and nitrifying bacteria occurred in lotus ponds. Habitat type was the most important factor influencing the bacterial community composition, evenness and diversity. Sediment pH and the amount of active phosphorus played the most important role in the composition of the bacterial community, and the heavy metals (Zn, Mn and Cr) and organic pollutants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAH) also had moderate influence. As Baiyangdian Lake is the central of Xiong'an New Area, the water quality management has become the hottest topic. Plenty of researches about environmental variables and aquatic species were taken, but lacking report of bacteria. This study provide basic information of bacterial community composition in this area, and help to understand the response of the bacterial community to habitat and seasonal change, which provide a scientific basis for the recovery and reconstruction of the degraded ecosystem.					; Wang, Wenjun/HJH-0493-2022	Yi, Yujun/0000-0002-5264-4321; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				JAN	2021	120								106959	10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106959	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106959													WOS:000591903100004

The results show that (a) the Be-7 dry deposition flux in the Dead Sea region is 2.0 +/- 0.6 x 10(4) atoms cm(-2) y(-1) during summer and winter and 5.3 +/- 0.7 x 10(4) atoms cm(-2) y(-1) during fall; (b) the residence time of dust in the Dead Sea drainage basin is less than one year; (c) the recycled component of the cosmogenic isotope Be-10 (t(1/2) = 1.39 10(6)y) in Judean desert dust is potentially small; and (d) the Be-7 inventory (atoms cm(-2)) in dust settled in the drainage basin did not reach steady state between consecutive rare events of desert winter floods suggesting a short transport rate of fine detritus material from the marginal terraces into the Dead Sea. Provided Be-10 behaves similarly (as implied by the common geochemistry and cosmogenic origin of Be-7 and Be-10), we suggest Be-10 in Lake Lisan (Pleistocene Dead Sea) detrital sediments as a potential proxy for paleo-flood frequency and dust transport.

J	Wu, YF; Blackburn, J; She, YT; Zhang, WM				Wu, Yifan; Blackburn, Julia; She, Yuntong; Zhang, Wenming			Sensitivity Analysis of Dissolved Oxygen in Cold Region Rivers Through Numerical Modelling	WATER												Dissolved oxygen (DO) is one of the most critical water quality constituents in cold region rivers. Harsh winter conditions pose significant challenges for DO sampling, making numerical modeling a valuable tool for gaining insights into DO concentrations during winter. Sensitivity analysis is essential for understanding the relative importance of the model parameters to the DO concentrations; however, such studies are rare. This study conducted a DO sensitivity analysis in the Lower Athabasca River, Canada, using a water quality model with ice effects in the MIKE HYDRO River. The simulated flow, water level, water temperature and DO concentrations closely matched observed values along the study reach. A bidirectional perturbation analysis was conducted to assess the sensitivity of DO concentrations to 14 model parameters. The results indicate that photosynthesis and respiration are the two most influential processes affecting river DO under winter conditions despite lower biomass activity compared to open-water conditions. A distinct seasonal pattern was observed for most parameters, with DO sensitivity during winter ice-covered periods being significantly higher than in summer open-water conditions. The study provides valuable insights for the development of integrated water quality and ice models for cold region rivers.

FRESHWATER BIOLOGY					Workshop on Ecological Effects of Reduced Nutrient Loading (Oligotrophication) on Lakes	JAN, 2003	Silkeborg, DENMARK					1. Lake restoration from eutrophication often rests on a simple paradigm that restriction of phosphorus sources will result in recovery of former relatively clear-water states. This view has apparently arisen from early successful restorations of deep lakes in catchments of poorly weathered rocks. Lakes in the lowlands, however, particularly shallow ones, have proved less tractable to restoration. This study of three lowland lakes provides insights that illuminate a more complex picture. 2. The lakes lie in a sequence along a single stream in a mixed urban and rural landscape. Severely deoxygenating effluent from an overloaded sewage treatment works was diverted from the catchment in 1991. Effects on two lakes, Little Mere (z(max) < 2 m) and Rostherne Mere (z(max) 31 m) were followed until 2002. Mere Mere (z(max) = 8 m), upstream of the former works, acted as a comparison for changes in water chemistry. Mere Mere showed no change in total phosphorus (TP), total inorganic nitrogen, or planktonic chlorophyll a concentrations. Increased winter rainfall was associated with higher winter soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and ammonium concentrations in its water. 3. Little Mere changed from a deoxygenated, highly enriched, fishless system, with large populations of Daphnia magna Straus, clear water and about 40% aquatic plant cover, to a slightly less clear system following diversion. Daphnia magna was replaced by D. hyalina Leydig as fish recolonised. Spring peaks of chlorophyll a declined but summer concentrations increased significantly. Annual mean chlorophyll a concentrations thus showed no change. Submerged plants became more abundant (up to 100% cover), with fluctuating community composition from year to year. Summer release of SRP from the sediment was substantial and has not decreased since 1993. The summer phytoplankton was apparently controlled by nitrogen availability perhaps with some influence of zooplankton grazing. SRP was always very abundant. The lake appeared to have reached a quasi-stable state by 2002. 5. Rostherne Mere showed a steady decline in TP and SRP concentrations following effluent diversion apparently as a result of steady dilution by water with lower phosphorus concentration. Decline in phosphorus concentrations was much less rapid than expected because of internal remobilisation from the hypolimnion and sediments. There have been no changes in chlorophyll a concentration or of nitrogen availability and by 2002 the phytoplankton probably remained limited by a combination of mixing, grazing and nitrogen. 6. A seeming paradox is, thus, that immense changes in phosphorus budgets have shown no consequences for phytoplankton chlorophyll concentrations in either of the lakes, although the seasonal distribution has altered in Little Mere. Although these case studies deviate from others, for both shallow and deep lakes, they represent distinctive situations rather than undermining conventional models.

J	MUELLER, HC; BERGER, DD				MUELLER, HC; BERGER, DD			FALL MIGRATION OF SHARP-SHINNED HAWKS	WILSON BULLETIN												Daily counts of sharp-shinned hawks were conducted on 915 days in the autumns of 1952 through 1964. A total of 17,628 sharp-shinned hawks was observed and 2,052 were trapped, banded and released. There are 2 peaks in the autumnal migration, one in mid-Sept., composed mostly of immature birds, and one in mid-Oct., composed largely of adults. Ninety-three per cent of the sharp-shinned hawks were observed on days with westerly winds, 72% were recorded within 2 days of the passage of a cold front, 69% were seen on days when the area temperature had dropped during the previous 24 hours, and 84% were observed on days when the sun was shining for at least one-half of the time between sunrise and sunset. Hawks fly when conditions are conducive for the formation of updrafts, and wind drift concentrates migrants along the leading line formed by the western shore of Lake Michigan. The flight behavior of hawks and the structure of updrafts is discussed. An analysis of 2 extraordinary migration flights suggests that weather conditions hundreds of miles to the north may affect the numbers of birds seen at Cedar Grove. The recoveries of banded birds, and observations of hawks at other points in the Upper Great Lakes region suggests that most of the hawks seen at Cedar Grove enter the area at the eastern and western ends of Lake Superior. The distribution of fall and winter recoveries suggest that the birds head approximately southward, are drifted eastward in the north and central portions of the eastern USA, and are drifted westward in the states bordering the Gulf of Mexico.																			0043-5643						1967	79	4					397	+																WOS:A1967A442500002

Dependence of pH values in the digestive tract of freshwater fishes on some abiotic and biotic factors	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The values of pH in the digestive tracts of 20 freshwater fish species inhabiting various Russian Federation waterbodies were studied. Only in six species (Coregonus lavaretus, Coregonus migratorius, Catostomus catostomus, Carassius gibelio, Rutilus rutilus, Leuciscus leuciscus) out of 20 species, the differences in pH values between different regions of the intestine were significant. Feeding habits, feeding frequency, and gut fullness in fish affected pH values. Temperature was one of the most important factors affecting pH values. During cold seasons (spring and fall; average water temperature: 8-10 and 5-6(aui)C, respectively), the pH values in fish guts were higher than that in the summer seasons(water temperature 22-25A degrees C) for C. gibelio, Perca fluviatilis, Cyprinus carpio, L. leuciscus, and R. rutilus from the Chany Lake. Similar results (lower pH values in intestine at higher water temperatures) were also obtained for C. gibelio in warmer years in comparison to colder years in the same waterbody and in L. leuciscus and P. fluviatilis in the different waterbodies with different water temperatures. It is hypothesized that dependence of pH in fish gut on temperature may serve as a regulatory mechanism for maintaining the activities of hydrolytic enzymes at the required level for their successful functioning.

However, the thermal environments influenced by these factors are subject to current weather conditions. Subjective responses towards physical environments have rarely been investigated previously. This study explored microenvironmental factors and their impacts on thermal perceptions (evaluated by thermal sensation vote, TSV) on the campus of the Southwest University of Science and Technology (Mianyang, China). Through combining field measurement with questionnaire, it was found that neutral temperatures (NTs) of Mianyang during the measuring periods indicated by physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) were 28.41 degrees C (summer), 12.37 degrees C (winter), and 18.92 degrees C (the full year), respectively. Additionally, TSV linearly correlated with parameters of vegetation (indicated by the leaf area index, LAI), land surface reflectivity (albedo), and the water surface (distance from the lake, the distance for short). LAI was usually negatively correlated with TSV. The increase in LAI by 1 point contributed to the decrease of 0.171 in TSV (10:00, R-2 = 0.295, p < 0.001, summer) and increasing the distance by 1 caused a rise of 0.076 in TSV (9:00, R-2 = 0.367, p < 0.001, summer). Most importantly, the statistical significance of the models varied for contexts, especially weather conditions and daily time. Generally, the summer models (R-2 = 0.391 maximumly) were more significant than winter (R-2 = 0.263 at most), expressed by higher R-2 values. In whole seasons, model R-2 polynomial correlated with PET. The TSV showed the weakest correlation with microenvironmental parameters in the neutral temperature ranges. This study has revealed subjective responses towards physical environments under various context. The findings might be directive for future physical-environment design works in pedestrians' thermal comfort improvements.																			2045-2322					APR 10	2025	15	1							12335	10.1038/s41598-025-96651-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-96651-x								40210706					WOS:001464774300027

In Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope), spring numbers, proportion of yearlings and numbers of young were studied. In gadwall (A. strepera), mallard (A. platyrhynchos), pintail (A. acuta) and Eurasian teal (A. crecca), only spring numbers were estimated annually. Comparisons of spring numbers at Myvatn with numbers wintering in Iceland (mallard) and Britain (the other four species) were made. Change in habitat use and in total spring numbers of all five species tracked chironomid abundance. Change in numbers of mallard, pintail and teal was negatively associated with density in the year before. Production of young wigeon was correlated with chironomid abundance although weather played a role. Reproductive success, which was determined by the availability of protein food (Chironomidae) on the breeding grounds, was the main variable determining dispersion and return rates, and hence annual change in spring densities on the breeding grounds of all five species.																			1217-8837						2008	54			1			131	143																WOS:000266462100014

The effects of biomanipulation using trophic cascade effects in the aquatic food chain vary with the conditions of applied water bodies and are controversial. However, this mode of biomanipulation has long been considered an ecosystem-friendly approach for the management of algal blooms. In the present study, herbivorous Daphnia similoides were artificially proliferated using a large culture system and were used to control algal blooms in a eutrophic agricultural reservoir. Introduced predators proliferated rapidly in the culture tanks, and high densities were subsequently sustained. Predators were then released into the reservoir at 1-week intervals during early summer and autumn, and 84.4% algal removal efficiency was observed and mean values of chlorophyll a concentration decreased from 219 to 34.2mgm(-3) during the algal bloom period in autumn. However, no apparent effects were observed during early summer when fish predation and water temperatures were high. These data suggest that continuous release of predators from our culture facility efficiently facilitates early expansion of zooplankton populations and maintenance of their populations in the reservoir. The effects of introduced zooplankton may be maximized with concurrent management of resident zooplanktivorous fish.

We were interested in the involved at-mospheric particulates-bound PAHs regarding their sources, cancer risk, and related cellular toxicity for those in other areas under comparable conditions. In this study, the daily concentrations of TSP, PM10, and PM2.5 were averaged 127.95, 95.91, and 67.62 mu g/m3, and the bound PAHs were averaged 1.31, 1.22, and 0.77 ng/m3 in summer and 12.72, 20.51 and 40.27 ng/m3 in winter, respectively. The dominant PAHs were those with 5-6 rings, and 4-6 rings in summer and winter, respectively. The incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) (90th percentile probability) of total PAHs was above 1.00E-06 in each age group, particularly high in adolescents. Sensitivity analysis indicated that slope factor and body weight had greater impact than exposure duration and inhalation rate on the ILCR. Moreover, treatment of human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells with mixed five indicative PAHs increased the formation of ROS, DNA damage (elevation in gamma-H2AX), and protein levels of CAR, PXR, CYP1A1, 1A2, 1B1, while reduced the AhR protein, with the winter mixture more potent than summer. For the sources of PAHs, the stable carbon isotope ratio analysis and diagnostic ratios consistently pointed to pe-troleum and fossil fuel combustion as major sources. In conclusion, our findings suggest that particulates-bound PAHs deserve serious concerns for a cancer risk in such environment, and the development of new power sources for reducing fossil fuel combustion is highly encouraged.					; Zeng, Minjuan/ITT-0566-2023	Chen, Yuting/0000-0003-4661-2048; Guo, Lianxian/0000-0002-4300-8315; 													0013-9351	1096-0953				DEC	2022	215		2						114383	10.1016/j.envres.2022.114383	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.114383		SEP 2022						36150442					WOS:000884399700001
J	Kim, B; Choi, K; Kim, C; Lee, UH; Kim, YH				Kim, B; Choi, K; Kim, C; Lee, UH; Kim, YH			Effects of the summer monsoon on the distribution and loading of organic carbon in a deep reservoir, Lake Soyang, Korea	WATER RESEARCH												Seasonal and vertical patterns of organic carbon concentration, and an organic carbon budget were studied in a deep reservoir in Korea. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) were measured in the river inflow and at the dam. Autochthonous production of carbon was estimated from phytoplankton primary productivity. Variations in POC were greater than for DOG, reflecting pronounced changes in algal biomass during the study period. Before the monsoon, in spring and early summer, DOC concentrations consistently were low (ca. 1.5 mg l(-1)). Heavy rains associated with the summer monsoon had substantial impacts on the lake's carbon budget. Turbid storm runoff supplied large quantities of nutrients and organic carbon to the metalimnion. Some of these substances were advected into the epilimnion, and may have contributed to a seasonal increase in primary productivity. Although annual rates of carbon supply from allochthonous and autochthonous sources were similar, the autochthonous carbon appears to be a more important energy source in the lake because most aliochthonous carbon was discharged from the dam without affecting the epilimnion.

J	Rupasinghe, PA; Chow-Fraser, P				Rupasinghe, Prabha Amali; Chow-Fraser, Patricia			Identification of most spectrally distinguishable phenological stage of invasive Phramites australis in Lake Erie wetlands (Canada) for accurate mapping using multispectral satellite imagery	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steudel subspecies australis is one of the worst plant invaders in wetlands of North America. Remote sensing is the most cost-effective method to track its spread given its widespread distribution and rapid colonization rate. We hypothesize that the morphological and/or physiological features associated with different phenological states of Phragmites can influence their reflectance signal and thus affect mapping accuracies. We tested this hypothesis by comparing classification accuracies of cloud-free images acquired by Landsat 7, Landsat 8, and Sentinel 2 at roughly monthly intervals over a calendar year for two wetlands in southern Ontario. We used the Support Vector Machines classification and employed field observations and image acquired from unmanned aerial vehicle (8 cm) to perform accuracy assessments. The highest Phragmites producer's, user's, and overall accuracy (96.00, 91.11, and 88.56% respectively) were provided by images acquired in late summer and fall period. During this period, green, Near Infrared, and Short-Wave Infrared bands generated more unique reflectance signals for Phragmites. Both Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Normalized Difference Water Index showed significant difference between Phragmites and the most confused classes (cattail; Typha latifolia L., and meadow marsh) during the late summer and fall period. Since meadow marsh separated out best from Phragmites and cattail in the February image, we used it to mask the meadow marsh in the July image to reduce confusion. The unique reflectance signal of Phragmites in late summer and fall is likely due to prolonged greenness of Phragmites when compared to other wetland vegetation, large, distinct inflorescence, and the water content of Phragmites during this period.

Seasonality of Continental Extratropical-Cyclone Wind Speeds Over Northeastern North America	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												This study investigates the seasonality of near-surface wind speeds associated with extratropical cyclones (ETCs) over northeastern North America using a global reanalysis data set during 1979-2020. As opposed to most studies that emphasize winter storms, ETCs during the fall exhibit significantly stronger 10-m winds over this region due to the slightly stronger continental cyclones and significantly weaker low-level stability during that time of the year. Also, ETCs favor inland lakes and Hudson Bay during the low-ice-content fall season, leading to lower surface roughness. Combining these results, we derive simple linear regressions to predict the 10-m wind speed given three variables: 850-hPa wind speed, low-level Richardson number, and surface roughness length. This formula captures the observed seasonality and serves as a valuable tool for cyclone near-surface wind risk assessment.

J	HAYES, FR; ANTHONY, EH				HAYES, FR; ANTHONY, EH			LAKE WATER AND SEDIMENT .1. CHARACTERISTICS AND WATER CHEMISTRY OF SOME CANADIAN EAST COAST LAKES	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Sixteen lakes are described, varying in geology and all but 2 of low productivity, and including 3 acid bog types. A method is described for indirect estimation of the sum of Na and K. In lakes generally, low pH is related to low conductivity, but in these coastal lakes the Na in ocean spray keeps up the conductivity even in very acid waters. At equilibrium the inorganic P in solution is 2-3 ppb and represents a residual soluble fraction, independent of productivity and pH. Total P is 10-15 ppb and the concentration is not related to productivity. There is an annual cycle of inorganic P with a winter maximum, spring decline, and summer minimum. Methyl orange alkalinity varies directly with the sum of Ca and Mg and with either of the ions separately. The scatter in the regression of alkalinity versus Mg is greater than that of alkalinity versus Ca. There is a reduction of per cent organic material in the sediments directly related to increasing alkalinity. The cause is attributed to greater bacterial activity as the pH goes up.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1958	3	3					299	307		10.4319/lo.1958.3.3.0299	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1958.3.3.0299													WOS:A1958WY36000006

W.; Wang, Yan; Zhang, Chaosheng			Peak Chromium Pollution in Summer and Winter Caused by High Mobility of Chromium in Sediment of a Eutrophic Lake: In Situ Evidence from High Spatiotemporal Sampling	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												To study the mechanisms of chromium (Cr) mobilization in sediments of eutrophic lakes, monthly sampling was performed in the Meiliang Bay of Lake Taihu, China, combined with laboratory experiments. High-resolution dialysis and diffusive gradients in thin film (DGT) sampling techniques were used. Results indicated that in July 2016 and January 2017, the concentrations of soluble Cr and DGT-labile Cr(VI) in the overlying water exceeded both drinking and fishery water quality standards, resulting from the high mobility of Cr in sediments. In July (summer), the high concentration of soluble Cr (134.04 +/- 7.20 mu g/L) detected in the anaerobic sediments was primarily caused by the complexation of Cr(III) with dissolved organic matter (DOM). This mechanism was supported by an observed simultaneous increase of soluble Cr and DOM under simulated anaerobic conditions. In January (winter), the high concentrations of soluble Cr (97.55 +/- 9.65 mu g/L) and DGT-labile Cr(VI) (25.83 +/- 1.25 mu g/L) in aerobic sediments were primarily caused by reoxidation of Cr(III) by Mn(III/IV) oxides as evidenced by the lowest concentrations of soluble and DGT-labile Mn(II). This study sheds light on the full-year mobilization in eutrophic lake sediments and suggests the urgent need for remediation of Cr pollution variation and mechanisms of Cr especially for winter.

J	Choi, JW; Kim, HD				Choi, Jae-Won; Kim, Hae-Dong			The recent increase in central eastern China summer rainfall and its possible mechanism	TELLUS SERIES A-DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												This study investigated interdecadal variations in summer rainfall in central eastern China before and after the mid-1990s. The mean difference in rainfall between the two epochs (average rainfall in the 1981-1995 period: 5.0mm day(-1); average rainfall in the 1996-2010 period: 6.0mm day(-1)) was significant at the 95% confidence level. This study explored the cause of the recent increase in summer rainfall in central eastern China by analyzing the difference in average rainfall between 1996-2010 (hereafter, Epoch II) and 1981-1995 (hereafter, Epoch I). Analysis of rainfall revealed that positive anomalies were observed in a southwest-northeast direction across the south-central region of eastern China, Korea, and Japan, while negative anomalies were observed at latitudes of 40-50 degrees N and in most areas in the western North Pacific region. These findings suggest that summer rainfall in central eastern China is part of East Asian summer monsoons and have an out-of-phase relationship with western North Pacific monsoons. To identify the cause of the recent increase in summer rainfall in central eastern China, the difference in 850hPa stream functions between Epoch II and Epoch I was analyzed. This study found that anomalous huge anticyclonic circulations were strengthened in the western North Pacific region and anomalous cyclonic circulations were strengthened in the south-central region of eastern China. As a result, anomalous northeasterlies originating from anomalous cyclones centered on Lake Baikal and anomalous southerlies originating from anomalous cyclones in the south-central area of eastern China joined in central eastern China. The typical anomalous atmospheric circulations in the negative Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) phase and the average PDO index and summer rainfall in central eastern China from June to August exhibited a high negative correlation, which was presumed to have been present since the previous winter.

Denitrification under lake ice	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Many lakes, ponds and reservoirs are subject to long and changing periods of ice cover. However, limited winter research has created key knowledge gaps. How does nitrogen cycling change under ice? And what does changing ice cover duration mean for water quality? Here we present the first measurements of denitrification rates under ice in temperate, polymictic waterbodies. Surprisingly, despite lower winter temperatures, winter and summer rates of denitrification did not differ. Experimental work suggests that denitrification rates are controlled hierarchically, first by nitrate concentrations, then by temperature. As a result, controls on nitrate inputs such as changing hydrology and nitrification, combined with physical controls on delivery of nitrate to sediments, may be more important to nitrate retention via denitrification than the duration of low temperature or ice cover. Nitrous oxide was typically supersaturated under-ice, suggesting an ice-out flux will occur, and this flux may be greatest in systems with elevated nitrate.					; Baulch, Helen/I-9529-2012	Cavaliere, Emily/0000-0001-7456-6750; Baulch, Helen/0000-0001-9018-4998													0168-2563	1573-515X				FEB	2018	137	3					285	295		10.1007/s10533-018-0419-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-018-0419-0													WOS:000425543200001
J	Walsby, AE; Avery, A; Schanz, F				Walsby, AE; Avery, A; Schanz, F			The critical pressures of gas vesicles in Planktothrix rubescens in relation to the depth of winter mixing in Lake Zurich, Switzerland	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The vertical distribution of the cyanobacterium Planktothrix (Oscillatoria) rubescens in Lake Zurich was investigated from March 1993 to June 1995 jy collecting filaments on filters and measuring them by epifluorescence microscopy and computer image analysis. The initial population, which began to stratify in April, decreased by up to 99% by June. During the summer,the population peaked at depths of 8-15 m; it reached a maximum areal filament-volume concentration of similar to 60 cm(3) m(-2) of lake surface in early September and was then entrained in the deepening surface layer. It became mixed progressively deeper, to the lake bottom in the cold winter of 1993-94, but less completely in the milder winter of 1994-95. Most of the filaments remained viable during the winter. At the end of the mild winter of 1994-5, 70% of filaments in the water column retained buoyancy, but after the cold winter of 1996-7 only 22% were buoyant. Few remained buoyant below 80 m, where the hydrostatic pressure caused gas vesicle collapse. The proportion that remain buoyant decreases with the depth and duration of winter mixing, and increases with the critical collapse pressure (p(c)) of the gas vesicles, which provide buoyancy. Strains of P. rubescens isolated from Lake Zurich differed in mean p(c) of their gas vesicles, from 0.9 to 1.1 MPa, the highest values in freshwater cyanobacteria. Allowing for a turgor pressure of 0.2 MPa, these strains would remain buoyant at depths down to 70 and 90 m, respectively. Natural selection for gas vesicles of high p(c) will operate by increasing the proportion of filaments that remain buoyant in the upper parts of the water column after circulation to various depths during the winter because only buoyant filaments will form the inoculum for the following season.																			0142-7873					JUL	1998	20	7					1357	1375		10.1093/plankt/20.7.1357	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/20.7.1357													WOS:000075260000011

The purpose of this manuscript is to determine the efficiency of the pulverizing aerator unit in the windy conditions of Goreckie Lake. The efficiency of the pulverization aerator depends on the wind conditions at the lake. It was necessary to conduct thorough research to determine the efficiency of water flow through the pulverization segment (water pump). It was necessary to determine the rotational speed of the paddle wheel, which depended on the average wind speed. Throughout the research period, measurements of hourly average wind speed were carried out. It was possible to determine the efficiency of the machine by developing a dedicated mathematical model. The latest method was used in the research, consisting of determining the theoretical volumetric flow rates of water in the pulverizing aerator unit, based on average hourly wind speeds. Pulverization efficiency under the conditions of Goreckie Lake was determined based on 6600 average wind speeds for spring, summer and autumn, 2018. Based on the model, the theoretical efficiency of the machine was calculated, which, under the conditions of Goreckie Lake, amounted to 75,000 m(3) per year.					; Rybacki, Piotr/AAA-2932-2019	Osuch, Ewa/0000-0002-3412-180X; Osuch, Andrzej/0000-0001-5616-5697; Rybacki, Piotr/0000-0001-7223-6491; Podsiadlowski, Stanislaw/0000-0002-1712-6174														1996-1073				MAY	2021	14	10							2796	10.3390/en14102796	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14102796													WOS:000662448300001

Conductivity is used as a tracer for delineating the advective influence of inflows from the Colorado and San Juan Rivers on nutrient delivery and distribution in the reservoir. High spring runoff (1000-2000 m3 .cntdot. s-1) enters the lake essentially as an overflow and dominates the nutrient cycle in the epilimnion.

Several potential causes were investigated. Although summer air temperatures were among the hottest on record, no significant relationships were found between meteorological factors and bloom abundance. Instead, a weak but significant relationship was found between surface water temperature and bloom abundance downstream of Lake Hume, because the hot weather is likely to have led to higher water temperatures promoting bloom development. Releases of cold water inflows into Lake Hume from its Murray River arm may have stimulated upwelling of nutrient-rich deeper water, promoting the establishment of the bloom in that lake. Total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations were within the mesoeutrophic range and significantly related to bloom abundance, although some nutrient would be contained within cyanobacterial cells. During peak bloom abundance, pH was above 8.5 at one site. One unusual feature was that the bloom occurred in very dilute water, at electrical conductivities of 40-50 mS cm(-1). However, this does not appear to have affected carbon uptake and photosynthesis at high pH. Further blooms may occur if similar hot summers occur in future.					; Baldwin, Darren/H-2257-2011	Baldwin, Darren/0000-0002-5355-6745; Bowling, Lee/0000-0002-0360-0410; 													1323-1650	1448-6059					2018	69	11					1649	1662		10.1071/MF18014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF18014													WOS:000448373600002

To assess the environmental condition of a shallow lake with strong anthropogenic pressure from forest monocultures, alpha and beta diversities were determined. Three monitoring stations were established in the shallow Kusrupuyewe Lake, southern Chile, which were monitored during the 2021 austral summer and winter. Alpha diversity was high indicating a stable environmental condition. In total, 103 species in summer, 96 species in winter and a high species diversity (Shannon index: H ' > 5 bits/ind) were recorded. Beta diversity indicated that this ecosystem is seasonally heterogeneous, is potentially productive and has a high species turnover. Based on the large species inventory, we conclude that this shallow lake is stable and diverse. Although it is threatened by the presence of forest monocultures, it maintains a stable environmental condition, mainly due to the ability of the phytoplankton present to self-regulate through the species turnover. This study provides the relevant background information to establish conservation measures around the shallow lake, an ecosystem that provides various ecosystem services for the local indigenous communities.

We analyzed the spatiotemporal variations of phytoplankton diversity in cold regions, employing techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Spearman correlation coefficient, and Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to unveil the critical environmental factors influencing phytoplankton diversity and habitat suitability under varying degrees of human interference. With 37 monitoring stations across two cold region rivers, phytoplankton and water bodies were monitored in spring, summer, and autumn, resulting in the collection and analysis of 111 phytoplankton samples and 13 environmental indicators at each station. By identifying critical water quality indicators and exploring nonlinear relationships, the study revealed intricate interactions between phytoplankton diversity and environmental factors. Our findings suggest that overall phytoplankton species diversity is lower in rivers with high human interference, with turbidity, NH4+-N, chlorophyll-a, and total phosphorus (TP) deemed critical factors. Conversely, chlorophyll-a, NH4+-N, and electrical conductivity (EC) were identified as important factors in rivers with lower human interference, indicating differences in phytoplankton driving mechanisms between the two rivers. These insights provide valuable references for the sustainable development and effective assessment of cold region river ecosystems in the Anthropocene.																			0959-6526	1879-1786				JUL 5	2024	461								142686	10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.142686	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.142686		MAY 2024											WOS:001248007600003

The role of temporal reproductive isolation, trophic polymorphism and growth rate fluctuations in the diversification of Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (L.) in Lake Kalarskii Davatchan, Transbaikalia, Russia	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Trophic polymorphism and temporal reproductive isolation are the drivers of sympatric differentiation in many fish taxa. We present a new case of ecologically based diversification of Arctic charr in a Transbaikalian mountain lake inhabited by reproductively isolated dwarf and normal forms. These forms differ in size, diets and morphology and breed, respectively, in April-May and in September-October representing a rare example of sympatric spring- and autumn-spawning charr pair. Microsatellite analysis reveals clear-cut genetic differences and low-level hybridization between them. Dwarf form charr are planktivorous and manifest uniform slow growth. Normal form charr, though genetically homogeneous, are highly heterogeneous in size-at-age. They are subdivided into omnivorous small-size and piscivorous large-size groups, which can be considered as incipient forms at an early divergence stage. As evidenced by back-calculated growth data, their size-at-age heterogeneity results from highly variable individual growth patterns, which include different combinations of slow and fast growth periods presumably associated with spawning and non-spawning years. Growth acceleration in late ontogeny may result in the transformation of some normal charr from the smaller into the larger group during their lifetime.

The Lake Prespa sediments broadly fall into 5 zones based on their sedimentology, geochemistry, palynology and the existing chronology. The Glacial sediments suggest low supply of carbon to the lake, but high summer productivity; intermittent siderite layers suggest that although the lake was likely to have mixed regularly leading to enhanced oxidation of organic matter, there must have been within sediment reducing conditions and methanogenesis. MIS 5 and 1 sediments suggest much more productivity, higher rates of organic material preservation possibly due to more limited mixing with longer periods of oxygen-depleted bottom waters. We also calculated lakewater delta O-18 from siderite (authigenic/Glacial) and calcite (endogenic/Holocene) and show much lower lakewater delta O-18 values in the Glacial when compared to the Holocene, suggesting the lake was less evaporative in the Glacial, probably as a consequence of cooler summers and longer winter ice cover.

J	Vegas, J				Vegas, J.			BSE digital image analysis of detrital rhythmites. Limnogeological interpretation of lacustrine sedimentary records of glacial origin (NW Iberian Range)	CUATERNARIO Y GEOMORFOLOGIA												In favourable geological and geomorphological settings of the NW Iberian Range glacial lakes accumulate and preserved fine laminated sediments (varves, rhythmites, graded layers). Their occurrence seem to be dependent on various interacting environmental factors, such as basin and catchment morphometry, catchtment's rocks and soils types and climate conditions. Image analysis of Backscattered Scanning Electron microscope Images (BSEI) of thin sections provides high-resolution digital documentation related to the number, texture, structure and composition of laminated sediments at annual and subannual scale. A careful construction of a fine-scale physical/textural properties of annually laminated lake sediments were emphasized in the present study. Nine kinds of detrital rhythmites are identified that can be grouped in two main types: i) Single rhythmites with two laminae. A single annual unit is composed of two layers (laminae) that can be distinguished on the basis of their thickness, composition and texture. ii) Multiple rhythmites with more than two laminae. In detail, these individual layers are representing certain seasons or even shortterm events whitin seasons (e.g. nival melt, spring floods, summer glacial melt, autumn storms, etc.). Detrital rhythmites are present in both sedimentary lacustrine records since their glacial origin (31360 y. Cal BP in the Hornillo lake and 20420 y. Cal BP in the Grande lake) to the beginning of the Holocene.					Vegas, Juana/M-9728-2014														0214-1744						2007	21	3-4					49	75																WOS:000215011100003

Two potential impacts of Dreissena on the phytoplankton community of the western, central, and eastern basins of Lake Erie were evaluated: Was selective feeding occurring as observed in Saginaw Bay and were reductions in biomass evident in the offshore regions of the three basins of Lake Erie? In the western basin, significant summer decreases in Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta, Cyanobacteria, and total phytoplankton biomass were observed after Dreissena introduction. Similarly in the spring, Bacillariophyta and total phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll a concentrations decreased significantly. Since several divisions of phytoplankton did not decrease in phytoplankton biomass in the western basin, and spring Cyanobacteria biomass increased significantly while other divisions decreased in biomass, selective feeding on the phytoplankton community was suggested. Where significant reductions in biomass were observed in the offshore waters of the western basin, they were approximately 50% of the reduction observed at the nearshore sites in Lake Erie by other workers. Dreissena impact on the phytoplankton community of the pelagic waters of the central and eastern basin appeared to be minimal. Pre- and post-Dreissena total phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll a concentrations were not significantly different or increased significantly after the Dreissena invasion. Biomass of several divisions of phytoplankton significantly increased after Dreissena introduction in the central and eastern basins. These included Bacillariophyta (central basin), Cyanobacteria (central and eastern basin), Chrysophyta (eastern basin), Chlorophyta biomass (eastern basin) and phytoplankton biomass (central basin) and chlorophyll a (central basin) in the spring, and Chrysophyta (eastern basin) and Cryptophyta biomass (central basin) in the summer. Generally, a reduction in phytoplankton biomass would be expected as a result of Dreissena grazing, not an increase in biomass. Dreissena-mediated changes in phytoplankton have generally occurred in shallow, well-mixed lakes, ponds, and embayments, not in deeper waters such as the central and eastern basins of Lake Erie.																			0380-1330						1999	25	1					135	148		10.1016/S0380-1330(99)70722-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(99)70722-7													WOS:000079811600011

McMurdo Dry Valley lake edge 'moats': the ecological intersection between terrestrial and aquatic polar desert habitats	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Aquatic ecosystems - lakes, ponds and streams - are hotspots of biodiversity in the cold and arid environment of Continental Antarctica. Environmental change is expected to increasingly alter Antarctic aquatic ecosystems and modify the physical characteristics and interactions within the habitats that they support. Here, we describe physical and biological features of the peripheral 'moat' of a closed-basin Antarctic lake. These moats mediate connectivity amongst streams, lake and soils. We highlight the cyclical moat transition from a frozen winter state to an active open-water summer system, through refreeze as winter returns. Summer melting begins at the lakebed, initially creating an ice-constrained lens of liquid water in November, which swiftly progresses upwards, creating open water in December. Conversely, freezing progresses slowly from the water surface downwards, with water at 1 m bottom depth remaining liquid until May. Moats support productive, diverse benthic communities that are taxonomically distinct from those under the adjacent permanent lake ice. We show how ion ratios suggest that summer exchange occurs amongst moats, streams, soils and sub-ice lake water, perhaps facilitated by within-moat density-driven convection. Moats occupy a small but dynamic area of lake habitat, are disproportionately affected by recent lake-level rises and may thus be particularly vulnerable to hydrological change.

Long-term disease dynamics in lakes: causes and consequences of chytrid infections in Daphnia populations	ECOLOGY												Understanding the drivers and consequences of disease epidemics is an important frontier in ecology. However, long-term data on hosts, their parasites, and the corresponding environmental conditions necessary to explore these interactions are often unavailable. We examined the dynamics of Daphnia pulicaria, a keystone zooplankter in lake ecosystems, to explore the long-term causes and consequences of infection by a chytridiomycete parasitoid (Polycaryum laeve). After quantifying host-pathogen dynamics from vouchered samples collected over 15 years, we used autoregressive models to evaluate (1) hypothesized drivers of infection, including host density, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, host-food availability, and lake mixing; and (2) the effects of epidemics on host populations. Infection was present in most years but varied widely in prevalence, from,1% to 34%, with seasonal peaks in early spring and late fall. Within years, lake strati. cation strongly inhibited P. laeve transmission, such that epidemics occurred primarily during periods of water mixing. Development of the thermocline likely reduced transmission by spatially separating susceptible hosts from infectious zoospores. Among years, ice duration and cumulative snowfall correlated negatively with infection prevalence, likely because of reductions in spring phytoplankton and D. pulicaria density in years with extended winters. Epidemics also influenced dynamics of the host population. Infected D. pulicaria rarely (< 1%) contained eggs, and P. laeve prevalence was positively correlated with sexual reproduction in D. pulicaria. Analyses of D. pulicaria density-dependent population dynamics predicted that, in the absence of P. laeve infection, host abundance would be 11-50% higher than what was observed. By underscoring the importance of complex physical processes in controlling host-parasite interactions and of epidemic disease in influencing host populations, our results highlight the value of long-term data for understanding wildlife disease dynamics.

The model was applied to collective drainage basins of the lake's Imazu (northwest), Hikone (northeast), and Otsu (south) areas. The hourly model was conducted using particular discharges from Kita (Ado) river, Takatoki (Ane) river, and Yasu River to obtain loading curves for phosphate (PO4) and silica (SiO2) by assimilating measured concentrations (2002-2003). The tank model was updated by adding an evapotranspiration routine and direct paths of groundwater discharges to the lake floor. The daily model was calibrated through analysis of water budget among the basin, inflow, lake and outflow, and then validated. The model was established and combined into a loading-discharge curve to determine the long-term external nutrient loadings entering the lake (1980-2017). Seasonal variation in nutrient loadings increased during spring and summer and decreased during winter. Annual phosphate-phosphorus (PO4-P) loading ranged from 217 to 296 tons yr(-1) in the North Basin and 45 to 76 tons yr(-1) in the South Basin, while SiO2 loading fluctuated from 16,027 to 32,655 tons yr(-1) and 2,518 to 5,490 tons yr(-1) in the North and South Basins, respectively.

J	Wong, JCY; Williams, DD				Wong, Jessica C. Y.; Williams, D. Dudley			Sources and seasonal patterns of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the hyporheic zone	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The hyporheic zone is a region underneath streambeds that integrates surface and groundwater. Although its location is central to biogeochemical linkages between the riparian zone, dissolved nutrients, and benthic biota, the seasonal quality and likely sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the hyporheic zone are not well understood. To investigate DOM characteristics in the hyporheic zone, water from the surface and subsurface (at depths 20, 60, and 100 cm below the streambed) was sampled every 4 weeks from 2007 to 2008 in a third-order stream in southern Ontario. Using UV spectroscopy, measures of spectral slopes, aromaticity, and A (254)/A (365) ratios (molecular weight) were obtained. Temporal changes in these measures were consistent with watershed processes such as shedding of leaf litter in the fall, and photochemical and biofilm influence in the spring and summer. The fluorescence index (a measure of relative DOM source) suggested that at the surface and in the downwelling zone, DOM microbial sources increased with depth in the sediment, regardless of the season. Excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) showed seasonally distinct, protein-like DOM components of bacterial origin that were stronger in the fall. Leachates from specific allochthonous DOM sources-leaf litter from Betula papyrifera (white birch) and Thuja occidentalis (white cedar)-and an autochthonous source, biofilm, were isolated and incubated with unfiltered surface water. EEMs from these leachates indicated that these sources could indeed help explain observed patterns of DOM in surface and subsurface waters. These results suggest that although DOM sources were relatively constant, biogeochemical processing within the hyporheic zone resulted a DOM pool that was temporally dynamic and altered the nature of organic matter transported downstream into lakes and rivers.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2010	647	1					99	111		10.1007/s10750-009-9950-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-009-9950-2													WOS:000277241700009

Geochemistry of thermal springs around Lake Abhe, Western Djibouti	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE ENERGY												The Republic of Djibouti, occupying an area of 23,180 km(2), falls within the arid zone of East Africa and is located above the 'Horn of Africa', adjacent to the Red Sea. This country has several thermal springs and fumaroles distributed over three regions - Lake Assal, Lake Hanle and Lake Abhe. The most characteristic feature of Lake Abhe is the presence of several linear chains of travertine chimneys. The thermal waters are typical of the Na-Cl type near neutral waters rich in CO2. These waters show an oxygen shift, indicating reservoir temperatures >200 degrees C. The chemical signature of the thermal springs and the geology of the Lake Abhe region are very similar to the Tendaho geothermal area of Ethiopia. The geology, temperature gradient and its proximity to DamahAle volcano make the LakeAbhe region a potential site for geothermal power development.

Mass transport waves amplified by intense Greenland melt and detected in solid Earth deformation	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The annual cycle and secular trend of Greenland mass loading are well recorded in measurements of solid Earth deformation. Horizontal crustal displacements can potentially track the spatiotemporal detail of mass changes with great fidelity. Our analysis of Greenland crustal motion data reveals that a significant excitation of horizontal amplitudes occurs during the intense melt years. We discover that solitary seasonal waves of substantial mass transport (1.67 +/- 0.54 Gt/month) traveled at an average speed of 7.1 km/month through Rink Glacier in 2012. We deduce that intense surface melting enhanced either basal lubrication or softening of shear margins, or both, causing the glacier to thin dynamically in summer. The newly routed upstream subglacial water was likely to be both retarded and inefficient, thus providing a causal mechanism for the prolonged ice transport to continue well into the winter months. As the climate continues to produce increasingly warmer spring and summer, amplified seasonal waves of mass transport may become ever more present with important ramifications for the future sea level rise. Plain Language Summary It has become well known that seasonal ice flow variability of Greenland outlet glaciers may often be associated with the drainage of supraglacial lakes that accumulate meltwater during summer. However, tracking the details is inevitably limited due to the fact that the mechanisms and rates of meltwater transfer are hidden from view, and theoretical models are fraught with a number of difficulties. Here we use a previously unrecognized source of data that constrain the mass transport during a season of intense Greenland melting and document the evolution of a mass transport wave as it passes down glacier. The breakthrough is twofold: demonstration of the power of the new technique and the first measurement of the mass amplitude. The technique is effectively using the measurement of the deformed solid Earth elastic response as a filter that uniquely responds to neighboring glacier mass changes. We quantify that the wave through Rink Glacier is enormous in terms of its mass transport, amounting to about half of the average annual discharge during 2000-2005, and travels at an average speed of 7.1 km/month. Our mass transport wave measurement is the first of its kind, on any of the major outlet glaciers of either Greenland or Antarctica.

Optimising monitoring times for surveys of ruru (Ninox novaeseelandiae novaeseelandiae)	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Automatic recording devices (ARDs) are becoming increasingly popular as a monitoring tool, especially for cryptic or nocturnal bird species. We wanted to determine the optimal time(s) of night and month(s) of the year for monitoring ruru (a small NZ owl) using ARDs, to enable development of a robust monitoring method that maximises probability of detection. Fourteen ARDs were placed at 500 m intervals throughout a 400-ha forest block in the Eglinton Valley, Fiordland, New Zealand, and the presence of ruru recorded monthly from August 2011 to March 2012. Data from the Department of Conservation's national Tier 1 Monitoring Programme (2011-2016), gathered from multiple locations across public conservation land (PCL), were also analysed to provide broader context. Both at the Eglinton Valley and across New Zealand PCL, ruru calls were detected in all months surveyed and during all periods of the night. Detection probability (derived from call activity) was generally higher in the North Island and the west coast of the South Island. At the Eglinton Valley the highest call activity occurred in December, with activity in spring generally higher than in summer. On PCL, calling activity was highest in spring and early summer and lowest in late summer. Patterns in how call activity changed throughout the night varied from month to month in the Eglinton Valley. Across New Zealand, PCL (for all months), the call activity peaked approximately 1 hour after sunset then steadily declined throughout the remainder of the night. Our results and those of previous studies indicate general patterns of calling activity but with local variation. We recommend that as a general rule, detection probability can be maximised by carrying out ruru monitoring surveys in the spring or early summer, during the first few hours after sunset. However, we also recommend an initial study of the site(s) to investigate local variations in call activity before any long-term monitoring is initiated.

Based on macrophyte cover conditions, the lake was divided into three major habitat types: (1) Potamogeton maackianus habitat, (2) Potamogeton maackianus and Myriophyllum spicatum habitat, and (3) uncovered or less-covered habitat. Fish were sampled quantitatively in the three habitat types by block nets seasonally from September 2002 to August 2003. A total of 10 469 individuals from 27 fish species were caught, among which 20 species were considered as small fishes. Rhodeus ocellatus, Paracheilognathus imberbis, Pseudorasbora parva, Micropercops swinhonis and Cultrichthys erythropterus were recognized as dominant small fishes according to their abundance and occurrence. It was noted that (1) small fishes predominated the total number of fish species in the lake, which reflected to some degree the size diminution phenomenon of fish resources; (2) many small fishes had plant detritus as their food item, which was consistent with the abundance of macrophyte detritus in the lake and implied the importance of detritus in supporting small fish secondary production. Canonical correspondence analysis suggested that the spatial distributions of most small fishes were associated with complex macrophyte cover conditions. Macrophyte biomass was positively correlated with species richness, diversity index and the catch per unit of effort (CPUE) of the fish community. Water depth had no significant effects on species diversity and distribution of the small fishes. Correspondence analysis revealed a higher occurrence of the small fishes and higher abundance of individuals in summer and autumn. Seasonal length-frequency distributions of several species indicated that more larval and juvenile individuals appeared in spring and summer. This study provides some baseline information which will be essential to long-term monitoring of small fish communities in the Yangtze lakes.

The age structure of char has changed since 1933 when 7 yr specimens were common. Today individuals older than 5 yr are scarce. The growth rate of 7-8 cm yr-1 was the same in 1933 and 1972-1973. Only old large female sticklebacks were netted, probably because males are too small. Food was more abundant and diverse in the south than in the north basin. In the south basin the food choice of the char was determined by peaks of the food organisms: in spring mostly chironomid pupae, during summer benthic crustaceans, mainly Lepidurus arcticus (Pallas) and Eurycercus lamellatus (Muller), and in autumn zooplankton (Daphnia longispina (Muller)). The proportion of chironomid larvae was always considerable. Sticklebacks and Radix peregra were taken when above food items were scarce. Food important in the south basin was scarce in the north basin, where sticklebacks and R. peregra were dominant food of the char, representing a case of constrained feeding behavior. The choice of food varied little with the size of the char (> 10 cm). Sticklebacks fed overwhelmingly on benthos, mainly chironomid larvae, E. lamellatus and Cyclops. In the N-basin, sticklebacks took R. peregra, their own eggs and undigestible trash much more commonly than elsewhere.																			0030-1299	1600-0706					1979	32	1-2					228	231		10.2307/3544229	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3544229													WOS:A1979HJ61200013

In 1977 at the deepest (8m) station, C. nr. maturus was usually abundant, but in 1978 it was scarce or absent. Chironomus nr. maturus was univoltine, but with part of the population emerging in the autumn and part in the spring and summer. The respective numbers for Tanytarsus dendyi Sublette were 0-17,352 (2,360) and 50,105 m-2; and respective weights were 0-1.20 (0.16) and 2.99 g m-2. Tanytarsus dendyi was almost always scarce or absent at the deepest station. It was trivoltine; each summer generation lasted ca. 2 months. It overwintered in the egg stage or as first instar larvae. Abundance of both species was higher than for species in the same genera in most other acid and circumneutral lakes. The sparser populations in deep water in 1978 may be related to a strong stratification in which oxygen supersaturation persisted for several weeks at intermediate depths.																			0003-0031	1938-4238				APR	1988	119	2					353	365		10.2307/2425818	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2425818													WOS:A1988P002000014
J	Yin, HB; Yin, P; Yang, Z				Yin, Hongbin; Yin, Peng; Yang, Zhen			Seasonal sediment phosphorus release across sediment-water interface and its potential role in supporting algal blooms in a large shallow eutrophic Lake (Lake Taihu, China)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Seasonal sediment internal phosphorus (P) release is known to affect annual algal blooms in eutrophic lakes. In this study, a year-long field investigation and laboratory sediment core incubation were conducted to study the relation-ship between sediment internal P cycling and algal growth in Lake Taihu. The results indicated that the concentrations of water total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll-a (Chla) correlated with seasonal temperature and were assumed to be caused by internal P release. From cold winter to warm seasons, sediment internal P (porewater P concentration and P flux) exhibits dynamic changes. Sediment porewater soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and its flux in the summer were approximately five times and eight times those during winter, respectively. The release of sediment mobile P in the summer decreases its concentration and can supply SRP for algal blooms. Laboratory core incubation indicated that Chla and phycocyanin concentrations in the overlying water showed similar changes to sediment porewater P and P flux when cores were incubated from low to high temperature. The results of this study indicated that warmer con-ditions could increase the sediment porewater P concentration and sediment P flux into the bottom waters and conse-quently enhance sediment P availability to algae. This study provides new insights into the relationship between internal sediment P cycling and algal blooms in Lake Taihu.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				OCT 20	2023	896								165252	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165252	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165252		JUL 2023						37400027					WOS:001040336800001

We used hydrologically modeled data as input for 2D hydraulic modeling. Our results show that, even though the MHQ will increase in the future (2050-2079), the erosional power of the flow will decrease on the study area. This can be attributed to the change of timing in floods from spring to autumn and winter, when the sea levels during flood peaks is higher, causing backwater effect. Even though the mean depth will not increase notably (from 1.14 m to 1.25 m) during MHQ, compared to the control period (1985-2014), the inundated area will expand by 15% due to the flat terrain. The increase in flooding may be restrained by adaptive regulations: strategies favoring ecologically sustainable and recreationally desirable lake water levels were modeled. The demands of environment, society, and hydropower are not necessarily contradictory in terms of climate change adaptation, and regulation could provide an adaptive practice in the areas of increased flooding.					; Veijalainen, Noora/AAN-4826-2020	Lotsari, Eliisa/0000-0002-0120-8722; Veijalainen, Noora/0000-0003-4665-933X; 														2073-4441				SEP	2019	11	9							1827	10.3390/w11091827	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11091827													WOS:000488834400090
J	Shi, W; Wang, MH; Zhang, YL				Shi, Wei; Wang, Menghua; Zhang, Yunlin			Inherent Optical Properties in Lake Taihu Derived from VIIRS Satellite Observations	REMOTE SENSING												Using in situ remote sensing reflectance and inherent optical property (IOP) measurements, a near-infrared (NIR)-based IOP algorithm is developed and tuned for Lake Taihu, in order to derive the particle backscattering coefficient b(bp)(lambda), total absorption coefficient a(t)(lambda), dissolved and detrital absorption coefficient a(dg)(lambda), and phytoplankton absorption coefficient a(ph)(lambda), with satellite observations from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP). The IOP algorithm for Lake Taihu has a reasonably good accuracy. In fact, the determination coefficients between the retrieved and in situ IOPs are 0.772, 0.638, and 0.487 for a(t)(lambda), a(dg)(lambda), and a(ph)(lambda), respectively. The IOP products in Lake Taihu that have been derived from VIIRS-SNPP observations show significant spatial and temporal variations. Southern Lake Taihu features enhanced b(bp)(lambda) and a(dg)(lambda), while northern Lake Taihu shows higher a(ph)(lambda). The seasonal and interannual variability of a(dg)(lambda) and b(bp)(lambda) in Lake Taihu is quantified and characterized with the highest b(bp)(lambda) and a(dg)(lambda) in the winter, and the lowest in the summer. In the winter, b(bp)(443) and a(dg)(443) can reach over 1.5 and 5.0 m(-1), respectively, while they are 0.5-1.0 and 2.0 m(-1) in the summer. This study shows that in Lake Taihu a(dg)(lambda) is the most significant IOP, while a(ph)(lambda) is the least in terms of the IOP values and contributions to remote sensing reflectance. The highest b(bp)(lambda) and a(dg)(lambda) occurred in the winter between 2017-2018, and the lowest b(bp)(lambda) and a(dg)(lambda) occurred in the summer of 2014. In comparison, the seasonal and interannual variability of mean a(ph)(lambda) for Lake Taihu is less significant, even though enhanced seasonal and interannual variability can be found in some parts of Lake Taihu, such as in the northern Lake Taihu region.

These may have been caused by temporary weakening of the monsoonal circulation associated with reduced northward heat transport by the oceans' or by feedback processes stimulated by changes in tropical land-surface conditions(10). Here we use a lake-sediment record from the montane Mediterranean zone of Morocco to address the question of whether these events were also felt in temperate continental regions. We find evidence of arid intervals of similar duration, periodicity and possibly timing to those in the tropics. But our pollen data show that the forest vegetation was not substantially affected by these events, indicating that precipitation remained adequate during the summer growing season. Thus, the depletion of the groundwater aquifer that imprinted the dry events in the lake record must have resulted from reduced winter precipitation. We suggest that the occurrence of arid events during the summer in the tropics but during the winter at temperate latitudes can be rationalized if they are both associated with cooler sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic.					van der Kaars, Sander/G-2268-2016; Pearce, Nicholas J G/B-5295-2009	Lamb, Henry Francis/0000-0003-0025-0766; Pearce, Nicholas J G/0000-0003-3157-9564													0028-0836					JAN 12	1995	373	6510					134	137		10.1038/373134a0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/373134a0													WOS:A1995QB06300053

Eight alfalfa cultivars and one synthetic line were examined at each of five sites. Epidemics occurred at three sites during the study. At Loon Lake, stand injury in inoculated plots in the spring after the epidemic averaged 98% and first-cut yield losses were 79%. At Melfort, stand losses were 24% and first-cut losses were 20%. At Swift Current, stand losses were 21% and first-cut losses were 10%. At each site, some stand recovery occurred over the growing season. As a result, losses in total yield over the year were lower than losses in first-cut yield. Damage caused by disease and low-temperature injury in the winter after the initial epidemic resulted in losses in stand and yield as great as those incurred initially. Line S-7312, selected for resistance to winter crown rot, exhibited the lowest losses in the study. Percentage losses in stand density after an epidemic were correlated with percentage losses in yield, but were not correlated with yield after subsequent low-temperature injury. Regression analysis was used to develop equations to estimate yield loss based on loss in stand caused by winter crown rot.

Gary; O'Gorman, Robert			Shifts in the diet of Lake Ontario alewife in response to ecosystem change	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In the 1990s, the Lake Ontario ecosystem was dramatically altered due to continued invasions of exotic species including dreissenid mussels and predatory cladocerans. We describe the diet and biomass of prey in the stomachs of adult (>= 109 mm TL) and sub-adult (< 109 mm TL) alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) in 2004 and 2005 across seasons and depths and compare our results to data from 1972 to 1988. During 2004 and 2005, adult alewife consumed primarily zooplankton prey at bottom depth zones <70 m and primarily Mysis at bottom depth zones >70 m. Mysis dominated the diets of adult alewife in all seasons except during the summer of 2004 when zooplankton dominated. Mysis dominated the diets of sub-adult alewife during early and late spring and zooplankton dominated the diets in summer and fall. Bythotrephes and Cercopagis were observed in the diets of both sub-adult and adult alewife. Diporeia was observed only rarely in adult alewife diets. The biomass of prey in alewife stomachs varied seasonally and increased with bottom depth for adult alewife. Alewife diets in 2004-2005 differed from those in 1972 and 1988 with an increase in the prevalence of Mysis, and a decline in the prevalence of zooplankton. The biomass of prey in adult alewife stomachs declined in 2004 and 2005 compared to 1972 and 1988, at bottom depth zones <70 m but not at bottom depth zones >70 m suggesting reduced food availability closer to shore. We hypothesize that consumption levels at the shallower depth zones, as indicated by very low biomass of prey in alewife stomachs, may not be Sufficient to sustain alewife growth. The increased prevalence of Mysis and common occurrence of predatory cladocerans in the diet of alewife means that alewife have shifted to a higher trophic position.

J	MORI, JG; GEORGE, JC				MORI, JG; GEORGE, JC			SEASONAL HISTOLOGICAL CHANGES IN GONADS, THYROID AND ADRENAL OF CANADA GOOSE (BRANTA-CANADENSIS-INTERIOR)	ACTA ANATOMICA												Cyclic histological changes in the testis, ovary, thyroid and adrenal of the North American eastern prairie population of Canada geese (B. canadensis interior) breeding in Ft. Churchill (Manitoba, Canada) and wintering in the Swan Lake refuge in Missouri (USA) were studied. The investigation was carried out during the following 6 periods of the yearly life cycle. Phase 1: pre-spring migration at Swan Lake (early March); phase 2: post-spring migration at Ft. Churchill (early May); phase 3: breeding (early June); phase 4: molt (early August); phase 5: pre-fall migration (early Sept.); phase 6: post-fall migration at Swan Lake (mid-October). The development of the testis and the initiation of spermatogenesis up to the formation of secondary spermatocytes was begun in phase 1. All stages of spermatogenesis, including the formation of spermatids and spermatozoa, were reached by the end of phase 2 and remained so through the most part of phase 3. The weight of testis recorded was highest in phases 2 and 3. Testicular regression characterized by progressive loss in weight, reduction of spermatogonia in the tubules and appearance of sudanophilic material in the intersititium commenced in phase 4 and lasted through phases 5 and 6. Though the initiation of ovarian development probably started in phase 1, the ovary weighed the highest in phase 2. At this time, the ovary contained numerous maturing ova in different stages of development and lipoidal atresia. Lipoidal atresia was more prominent among young small ova. The larger maturing ova were characterized by a more distinct granulosa layer around the oocyte. Numerous sudanophilic interstitial cells were present scattered throughout the ovarian stroma. Atretic follicles and scars from discharged follicles were found in all the phases. The thyroid showed a significant increase in weight during molt (phase 4). No marked histological changes were discernible in all the phases. The increase in weight during molt is attributed to hyperplasia and increased thyroxine production to meet the energy demands of feather production and thermogenesis. The adrenal also showed an increase in weight during molt. No marked histological changes were noticed in any of the phases. The increase in adrenal weight during molt is attributed to increase in interrenal and chromaffin tissues, which is suggestive of a stress syndrome.																			0001-5180						1978	101	4					304	324											665136					WOS:A1978FC36100002

An analysis of hydrogeological behavior in the Geyser Valley, Kronotskii nature reserve, Kamchatka after the disaster of June 3, 2007	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND SEISMOLOGY												This paper describes the results from observations of the hydrogeological behavior in the Geyser Valley in 2007-2013 at the main monitored geysers and springs and in Lake Podprudnoe after the disastrous landslide of June 3, 2007. According to observations at Bolshoy Geyser, its mean eruption period is almost two times shorter compared to that before the landslide; it is 63 min now. Its activity is controlled by the level of Lake Podprudnoe. Velikan Geyser was found to have a significantly shorter period of eruption, decreasing from the mean annual value of 379 min (in 2007) to 335 min during the first 3 years after the disastrous landslide, with the mean annual eruption period subsequently stabilizing. It was found that Velikan Geyser showed an increasing period of eruption within its hydrogeologic cycle during winter (by about 50 min on average). The mean annual value of the deeper discharge component in the hydrothermal system (as determined by the chloride technique) is estimated as 215 kg/s; it was observed to decrease (by 30%) during the spring-summer flooding. The injection of meteoric waters from Lake Podprudnoe did not produce any significant hydrochemical changes in the Velikan and Pervenets geysers, but the main component of the deeper heat carrier was found to be diluted in Bolshoy Geyser. On the whole, the gas composition of the pipes in the geysers and boiling springs is dominated by the atmospheric component, while the feeder reservoir of Velikan Geyser is dominated by CO2 and N-2 with considerable concentrations of methane and hydrogen. TOUGH2 modeling showed that the decrease in the eruption period was related to the hydrodynamic effects of Lake Podprudnoe. We examined the influence of seismicity on the eruption behavior of Velikan Geyser.					; Dubinina, Elena/A-8694-2014; Kiryukhin, Alexey/Q-3615-2016	Rychkova, Tatiana/0000-0002-6844-8771; Kiryukhin, Alexey/0000-0001-5468-1452													0742-0463	1819-7108				JAN	2015	9	1					1	16		10.1134/S0742046315010030	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0742046315010030													WOS:000351110200001

Patterns of terrestrial and limnologic development in the northern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (USA) during the late-glacial/early-Holocene transition	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												A high-resolution record of pollen, charcoal, diatom, and lithologic data from Dailey Lake in southwestern Montana describes postglacial terrestrial and limnologic development from ice retreat ca. 16,000 cal yr BP through the early Holocene. Following deglaciation, the landscape surrounding Dailey Lake was sparsely vegetated, and erosional input into the lake was high. As summer insolation increased and ice recessional processes subsided, Picea parkland developed and diatoms established in the lake at 13,300 cal yr BP. Closed subalpine forests of Picea, Abies, and Pinus established at 12,300 cal yr BP followed by the development of open Pinus and Pseudotsuga forests at 10,200 cal yr BP. Increased planktic diatom abundance indicates a step-like warming at 13,100 cal yr BP, and alternations between planktic and tychoplankic taxa suggest changes in lake thermal structure between 12,400 and 11,400 cal yr BP. An increasingly open forest, in combination with increased benthic diatoms, indicates warm dry summers during the early Holocene after 11,400 cal yr BP, in contrast to nearby records in northern Yellowstone that register prolonged summer-wet conditions until ca. 8000 cal yr BP. Because of its low elevation, Dailey Lake was apparently sensitive to the direct effects of increased summer insolation on temperature and effective moisture, registering dry summers. In contrast, higher elevations in northern Yellowstone responded to the indirect effects of an amplified seasonal insolation cycle on atmospheric circulation, including elevated winter snowpack and/or increased summer convective storms as a result of enhanced monsoonal circulation.

The results show that these two extreme events exhibit atmospheric circulation patterns in the mid-high latitudes of Eurasia, with a positive anomaly center over the Ural Mountains and a negative one to the south of Lake Baikal (UMLB), which is a pattern quite similar to that for all the typical events. However, the Eurasian teleconnection patterns in the 2011 event, which are accompanied by a negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation, are different to those of the typical events and the 2008 event. We further find that a common anomalous signal appearing in early summer over the tropical Indian Ocean may be responsible for the following late-winter Eurasian teleconnections and the associated JSTA events in China. We show that sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) in the preceding summer over the western Indian Ocean (WIO) are intimately related to the UMLB-like circulation pattern in the following January. Positive WIOSSTAs in early summer tend to induce strong UMLB-like circulation anomalies in January, which may result in anomalously or extremely cold events in China, which can also be successfully reproduced in model experiments. Our results suggest that the WIOSSTAs may be a useful precursor for predicting JSTA events in China.

We conducted in situ experiments with three CO2 concentrations (270, 380 and 750 ppm) over four seasons during 2012 and 2013. Our results showed that phycocyanin-rich picocyanobacteria were dominant in winter and that photosynthetic picoeukaryotes were prevalent during the other three seasons. CO2 elevation could significantly increase the abundance of photosynthetic picoeukaryotes in all seasons except winter, but did not have any influence on picocyanobacterial abundance. CO2 enrichment caused an increase in the primary production of the picoplankton community in most seasons, and significant differences were observed among the treatments in summer and winter. In addition, the contribution of picoplankton to total primary production significantly increased under higher CO2 concentrations in winter. The increase in the abundance of photosynthetic picoeukaryotes and the primary production of picoplankton under high CO2 concentrations may reduce the transfer of matter and energy to higher trophic levels and increase the importance of the microbial food web.					; Li, Shengnan/AAR-4992-2020	Zhou, Jian/0000-0001-8001-1268; 													1323-1650	1448-6059					2016	67	3					319	326		10.1071/MF14353	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF14353													WOS:000371081600005

In the West Pond sediment, inorganic nitrogen (ammonium-nitrate) flux was estimated in the months (April, July, October, January) that represent the seasons. Negative ammonium and nitrate flux (retention) values were changed between 809.48 and 2069.52 mu g.m(-2).day(-1), from 2053.77 to 7718.10 mu g.m(-2).day(-1), respectively. The minimum and maximum inorganic nitrogen (ammonium-nitrate) flux values were estimated in July and January, respectively. During the decomposition or decay of macrophytes in autumn-winter period, the overlying water's high ammonium values (3.16 - 5.04 mgL(-1)) showed that rnacrophytes play an important role in preventing or suppressing the release of mineralized dissolved nitrogen from sediment to the overlying water. The other possible factors on the continuity of the pond eutrophication and the hindered nitrogen flux were no significant differerence at water temperature (18.53 - 21.28 degrees C), no occurrence of anoxic condition in the pond (dissolved oxygen; 5.85 - 7.28 mgL(-1)) and not a suitable range of pH (7.09 - 7.62) for the nitrification process.

J	Cui, LL; Liang, JH; Fu, HB; Zhang, LW				Cui, Lulu; Liang, Jianhong; Fu, Hongbo; Zhang, Liwu			The contributions of socioeconomic and natural factors to the acid deposition over China	CHEMOSPHERE												China has experienced severe acid rain pollution during the past decades due to excessive sulfur oxides (SO2) and nitrous oxides (NOx) emissions, which further caused lake acidification, biodiversity losses and climate change. Although the major sources of acid deposition have been clarified previously, the contributions of socioeconomic (natural) factors to the regional acid deposition remained unknown. Therefore, a series of valuable data including socioeconomic (natural) variables and measured pH value in the rainwater at the city level were collected to identify the key factors influencing the rainwater pH value at the national and the regional scale using the spatial econometric model/geographical detector technique and geographical weight regression (GWR) model, respectively. The results showed that the annual mean pH value in the rainwater in China was 6.54 +/- 0.72. The rainwater pH in winter (6.01 +/- 0.41) was significantly lower than those observed during summer (6.74 +/- 0.64), spring (6.71 +/- 0.71) and autumn (6.71 +/- 0.69). The spatial econometric model indicated that socioeconomic indicators including per capita gross industrial production (GIP), ratio of built-up area to the urban land (RBU), foreign direct investment (FDI), SO2 emission, and meteorological factors of annual mean precipitation (AMP), and annual mean relative humidity (AMRH) were the main factors for the acid deposition. The geographical detector technique implied that the power of determinants were in the order of AMRH (10.00%) = AMP (10.00%) > SO2 emission (8.51%) > FDI (8.32%) > RBU (7.64%) > per capita GIP (7.00%). The GWR implied that GIP, FDI, and SO2 emission made relatively higher contribution to acid deposition in East China relative to other regions owning to the huge population and the higher energy consumption. The higher rainfall amount and RH in Southeast China significantly increased the pollutant deposition fluxes and promoted the heterogeneous transformations of precursors of acid rain, respectively. The findings herein shed light upon the socioeconomic forces for the acid deposition in China for the first time and provided the new information for government sectors to control the acid rain pollution in the future.

J	YOUNG, JO; IRONMONGER, JW				YOUNG, JO; IRONMONGER, JW			A COMPARATIVE-STUDY OF THE LIFE HISTORIES OF 3 SPECIES OF LEECHES IN 2 BRITISH LAKES OF DIFFERENT TROPHIC STATUS	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The life histories of Erpobdella octoculata, Glossiphonia complanata and Helobdella stagnalis in an upland, unproductive lake and a lowland, productive lake in Britain were studied over 2 yr. In both lakes, the majority of E. octoculata lived for 1 yr with 81 and 75% of a year-class dying in the productive lake and unproductive lake, respectively. G. complanata had a predominantly 1 yr life cycle with about 72 and 88% of leeches in the productive lake and unproductive lakes, respectively, dying after 1 yr. H. stagnalis had distinct spring and summer breeding periods in both lakes. In the productive lake, it is possible that the summer breeders were the offspring of overwintering adults which had bred in the spring, but in the unproductive lake their origin is uncertain. Several aspects of the life history of the leeches are temperature dependent. The 3 spp. showed contrasts in their responses to lake productivity in terms of numbers, average weight, population biomass and fecundity.																			0003-9136						1982	94	2					218	250																WOS:A1982PE92000005
J	Tsydenov, BO				Tsydenov, Bair O.			A numerical study of the thermal bar in shallow water during the autumn cooling	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The article presents numerical simulation of the autumnal thermal bar dynamics on the example of the Selenga River shallow water in Lake Baikal. Hydrophysical and atmospheric conditions of the object under study in autumn are taken into account. The influence of river inflow (runoff current and water mineralization) and wind impact on the thermal bar behavior are evaluated. The numerical modeling analysis demonstrates that in the early stage of the thermal bar development, the most significant for convection is the momentum of the river inflow. However, with the distance increase between the thermal bar and the river mouth, the role of the river mineralization and wind stress also increases. Highly mineralized inflow waters have the largest impact on thermohydrodynamic processes in shallow waters under calm weather conditions. Wind action on the lake surface may lead to the deviation of the line of convergence of water masses from to the 4 degrees C isotherm. Moreover, prolonged wind activity may result in the destruction of the thermal bar front and vertical thermal homogeneity across the entire shallow water area.

J	JONES, RC; ADAMS, MS				JONES, RC; ADAMS, MS			SEASONAL-VARIATIONS IN PHOTOSYNTHETIC RESPONSE OF ALGAE EPIPHYTIC ON MYRIOPHYLLUM-SPICATUM L	AQUATIC BOTANY												The photosynthetic response to light of epiphytic algae from Lake Wingra, Wisconsin [USA] was determined monthly during the 1978 and 1979 growing seasons. A 14C technique was developed for measurement of photosynthesis of the intact epiphyte community which was then removed by shaking. The photosynthetic rate at low light, .alpha., varied from 5.56-18.26 .mu.g C (mg Chl [chlorophyll] a)-1 h-1 (.mu.E m-2 s-1)-1 while .**GRAPHIC**. the photosynthetic rate at light saturation, ranged from 1.0-2.6 mg C (mg Chl a)-1 h-1. During 1979, variations in .alpha. and .**GRAPHIC**. followed the sun-shade model for photosynthetic adaptation; .**GRAPHIC**. was highest in summer and lowest in spring and fall, while .alpha. followed the opposite pattern. Patterns in .alpha. and .**GRAPHIC**. for 1978 were less apparent. During 1979, .**GRAPHIC**. was significantly correlated with temperature and long-term average irradiance. When data from both years were combined, .**GRAPHIC**. was significantly correlated only with temperature, but the derived parameter IK (= .**GRAPHIC**. correlated significantly with both temperature and long-term average irradiance. Apparently, epiphytic algae growing at different depths did not have different photosynthetic responses to light. This is perhaps due to the large variation in response between replicate samples which could not be reduced to logistical limitations.

J	Dean, WE; Neff, BP; Rosenberry, DO; Winter, TC; Parkhurst, R				Dean, Walter E.; Neff, Brian P.; Rosenberry, Donald O.; Winter, Thomas C.; Parkhurst, Renee			The Significance of Ground Water to the Accumulation of Iron and Manganese in the Sediments of Two Hydrologically Distinct Lakes in North-Central Minnesota: A Geological Perspective	GROUND WATER												Williams and Shingobee lakes are at opposite ends of the local ground water flow system in the Shingobee River Headwaters Area (SRHA) in north-central Minnesota. Williams Lake, situated near the highest point in the flow system, has no surface inlet or outlet, and ground water and precipitation are the only sources of water. Shingobee Lake, situated at the lowest point in the flow system, has the Shingobee River as an inlet and outlet. Ground water directly contributes an estimated one-fourth of the water input to Shingobee Lake. The Shingobee River also receives large amounts of ground water discharge along its reach to Shingobee Lake providing a large, indirect source of ground water to the lake. Differences in nutrient concentrations reflect the residence times and nutrient supplies of these two lakes. The average phosphorus content of Shingobee Lake is about twice that of Williams Lake. Consequently, phytoplankton productivity in Shingobee Lake is much higher than in Williams Lake, leading to an oxygen-deficient (<1 ppm dissolved oxygen) hypolimnion within a month after overturn in both the spring and fall. Because of the extreme reducing conditions in the hypolimnion of Shingobee Lake, high concentrations of dissolved iron and manganese are present there during summer stratification. In some years, the manganese concentration in the hypolimnion of Shingobee Lake remains high throughout the year. Precipitation of iron and manganese minerals, presumed to be X-ray amorphous oxyhydroxides, at periods of fall and spring overturn result in concentrations of iron and manganese in surface sediments of Shingobee Lake that are seven times and 27 times higher, respectively, than can be explained by contributions of iron and manganese from detrital aluminosilicates. These findings indicate that the source and amounts of this excess iron and manganese found in the sediments are correlated to the amount of iron- and manganese-rich ground water discharging to Shingobee Lake. Because iron and manganese oxyhydroxides are efficient adsorbers of phosphorus, concentrations of phosphorus are also high in the sediments of Shingobee Lake. Without this sequestration of phosphorus, the productivity of Shingobee Lake would probably be much higher.

Comprehensive Bee Pathogen Screening in Belgium Reveals Crithidia mellificae as a New Contributory Factor to Winter Mortality	PLOS ONE												Since the last decade, unusually high honey bee colony losses have been reported mainly in North-America and Europe. Here, we report on a comprehensive bee pathogen screening in Belgium covering 363 bee colonies that were screened for 18 known disease-causing pathogens and correlate their incidence in summer with subsequent winter mortality. Our analyses demonstrate that, in addition to Varroa destructor, the presence of the trypanosomatid parasite Crithidia mellificae and the microsporidian parasite Nosema ceranae in summer are also predictive markers of winter mortality, with a negative synergy being observed between the two in terms of their effects on colony mortality. Furthermore, we document the first occurrence of a parasitizing phorid fly in Europe, identify a new fourth strain of Lake Sinai Virus (LSV), and confirm the presence of other little reported pathogens such as Apicystis bombi, Aphid Lethal Paralysis Virus (ALPV), Spiroplasma apis, Spiroplasma melliferum and Varroa destructor Macula-like Virus (VdMLV). Finally, we provide evidence that ALPV and VdMLV replicate in honey bees and show that viruses of the LSV complex and Black Queen Cell Virus tend to non-randomly co-occur together. We also noticed a significant correlation between the number of pathogen species and colony losses. Overall, our results contribute significantly to our understanding of honey bee diseases and the likely causes of their current decline in Europe.

Iestyn; Shi, Kun; Yang, Xiaofan			Numerical simulation of thermal stratification in Lake Qiandaohu using an improved WRF-Lake model	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Lake thermal stratification is important for regulating lake environments and ecosystems and is sensitive to climate change and human activity. However, numerical simulation of coupled hydrodynamics and heat transfer processes in deep lakes using one-dimensional lake models remains challenging because of the insufficient representation of key parameters. In this study, Lake Qiandaohu, a deep and warm monomictic reservoir, was used as an example to investigate thermal stratification via an improved parameterization scheme of the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF)-Lake. A comparison with in situ observations demonstrated that the default WRF-Lake model was able to simulate well the seasonal variation of the lake thermal structure. However, the simu-lations exhibited cold biases in lake surface water temperature (LSWT) throughout the year while generating weaker stratification in summer, thereby leading to an earlier cooling period in autumn. With an improved parameterization (i.e., via determination of initial lake water temperature profiles, light extinction coefficients, eddy diffusion coefficients and surface roughness lengths), the modified WRF-Lake model was able to better simulate LSWT and thermal stratification. Critically, employing realistic initial conditions for lake water tem-perature is essential for producing realistic hypolimnetic water temperatures. The use of time-dependent light extinction coefficients resulted in a deep thermocline and warm LSWT. Enlarging eddy diffusivity led to stronger mixing in summer and further influenced autumn cooling. The parameterized surface roughness lengths miti-gated the excessive turbulent heat loss at the lake surface, improved the model performance in simulating LSWT, and generated a warm mixed layer. This study provides guidance on model parameterization for simulating the thermal structure of deep lakes and advances our understanding of the strength and revolution of lake thermal stratification under seasonal changes.

J	Borgstrom, R				Borgstrom, R			Relationship between spring snow depth and growth of brown trout, Salmo trutta, in an alpine lake:: Predicting consequences of climate change	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH					International Symposium on High-Mountain Lake and Streams: Indicators of a Changing World	SEP 04-08, 2000	INNSBRUCK, AUSTRIA					Growth of brown trout in the alpine lake Litlosvatn, 1172 m a.s.l. on the Hardangervidda mountain plateau in western Norway, has been studied in relation to annual variations in accumulated spring snow, and date of ice-breaks during the period 1991-1998. The annual growth was negatively correlated with the spring snow, depth. During the years 1992-1995, a period with mean spring snow depth at 275 cm, the observed average annual growth of the age-classes 6-8 was 3.5 cin, or a reduction of about 50% compared to years with much less snow in spring (1991 and 1996). Average spring snow depth during the period 1990-1999 was 220 cm, while the average for the period 1930-1979 was 169 cm. A further increase in winter precipitation, resulting in even more accumulated spring snow compared to the 1990-1999 level, would result in further reduction in growth of brown trout in the lake. Thus, the present catchable size of brown trout would probably not be reached, due to increased Population density and an additional density dependent growth, A climate change, resulting in more snowfall in the whole alpine region of West Norway, as predicted by climate models, may therefore have an important negative effect oil fish production and fisheries in a whole region.																			1523-0430					NOV	2001	33	4					476	480		10.2307/1552558	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1552558													WOS:000172713800014
J	Perkins, RG; Underwood, GJC				Perkins, RG; Underwood, GJC			Gradients of chlorophyll a and water chemistry along an eutrophic reservoir with determination of the limiting nutrient by in situ nutrient addition	WATER RESEARCH												Alton Water, Suffolk, UK, is a linear reservoir, with input water pumped into the northwest end and drawoff tower in the main basin at the southeast end. The reservoir had an eutrophic to mesotrophic gradient in 1995 and 1996, primarily due to differences in summer. In 1995 mean summer chlorophyll a concentration at the northwest end was 95 +/- 34 mu g l(-1), 24 times that in the main basin. Total phosphorus, orthophosphate, nitrate and ammonium concentrations significantly decreased along the length of the reservoir, whilst Secchi depth increased. The first two components of principal component analysis (PCA) explained 37.4% of the variation in the data set, with ordination of sample sites along opposing gradients of TP and Secchi depth. The northwest end of the reservoir had high suspended solids and algal biomass whilst the main basin was a clear water site with high Secchi depth. Phosphorus was more limiting than nitrogen (DIN:OP > 16.1), however Si:TP fell below 16:1 during spring (March-May) and summer (July-September) indicating possible silica limitation to diatoms. In situ nutrient addition experiments (September 1996-August 1997) indicated phosphorus limitation, with response to phosphate addition significantly increasing along the length of the reservoir. Go-limitation did not occur as addition of phosphate, ammonium and silicate together produced the-same response as phosphate addition alone. Alkaline phosphatase activity assay supported the pattern of phosphorus limitation with highest activity in the main basin. Manipulation of zooplankton grazing did nor control the algal biomass response to phosphate addition. Ferric dosing of the pumped input coupled with the topography of the reservoir limited algal biomass in the main basin through bottom-up nutrient limitation (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Seasonal depletion of resources intensifies trophic interactions in subarctic freshwater fish communities	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Climate change in recent decades has resulted in an increase in both the density and diversity of consumers in subarctic freshwater ecosystems. Despite this, harsh winter conditions in the region limit productivity and may serve as a bottleneck driving trophic interactions within the fish community, potentially determining the outcome of climate change for resident biota. However, due to the difficulties in sampling during winter months, few studies have assessed seasonal variation in the ecological interactions between native and range-expanding species in subarctic regions. We examined seasonal variation in activity, diet (stomach content) and resource use (C-13 and N-15 stable isotope ratios) of two fishes: the resident cold-water-adapted European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus L.) and the range-expanding cool-water-adapted ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernua L.) in lakes with low and high consumer density. Results were contrasted with seasonal availability of benthic and pelagic resources and indirect measures of individual fitness, that is condition, growth and estimated lipid content (muscle elemental C:N ratio) of both species. The effects of fish density were apparent in both the diet and resource use of whitefish, which altered their diet and displayed reduced stomach fullness during winter in high-density lakes. This was associated with an overall reduction in whitefish growth, condition and estimated lipid content in high-density lakes, which was especially pronounced during winter. Ruffe utilised a greater proportion of profundal resources than whitefish in both summer and winter, potentially exploiting a vacant niche. Ruffe maintained condition and lipid reserves throughout the winter, highlighting the potential for further northward range expansion of the species. Winter acts as a seasonal bottleneck in subarctic lakes, but assumptions that this bottleneck primarily selects against warmer-water-adapted invasive species such as ruffe may be too restrictive. The effects of seasonal resource depletion on fish condition and invertebrate density were most severe in lakes with a high density of fish, and in these conditions, the cold-water-adapted resident whitefish was most adversely affected.					; Harrod, Chris/A-8830-2008	Hayden, Brian/0000-0002-8524-7373; Harrod, Chris/0000-0002-5353-1556; Kahilainen, Kimmo/0000-0002-1539-014X													0046-5070	1365-2427				MAY	2015	60	5					1000	1015		10.1111/fwb.12564	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12564													WOS:000352571600013

Considerable overlap between the phases was found in all plumage color characteristics except facial patterns. The feathers of the head are molted twice annually, and most facial intermediacy of juvenile and wintering birds disappears as the breeding season approaches. Most body feathers are molted once, except those of the flanks, scapular region, and base of the leg, which appear to be in a state of molt throughout the year. These feathers, especially those of the flanks, are believed to be those ingested regularly by the birds. Some birds molt the remiges with the annual (prebasic) molt in late summer, but some, possibly birds in their first winter, molt them in midwinter. The dark-phase birds on Clear Lake, California [USA] are larger and may be descendents of wintering birds from the north.																				1938-4254					1985	102	1					102	119		10.2307/4086826	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4086826													WOS:A1985ADV0700010

Stages of the parasite were recovered from the peritoneum around the swim bladder, bases of the fins, and the fins. Prevalence of infections was high and intensities relatively low. The parasite was less prevalent in longnose (Catostomus catostomus (Forster)) and redhorse (Moxostoma macrolepidotum (LeSueur)) suckers collected from the same area. Males, female 4th-stage larvae, uninseminated, inseminated, subgravid, and gravid females were recovered from fish collected from southern Lake Huron. Prevalence was 83-100% throughout the year and showed no significant seasonal trend. Numbers of worms recovered ranged from 1-32 per fish; 77% were infected with from 1-7 worms. Intensities of infections varied significantly with season, being highest during fall, winter, and early spring. All age groups of white suckers were infected, and intensity did not vary significantly with host age. Although P. huronensis was highly prevalent throughout the year and from one year to the next, the life cycle was completed in a single year. The evolution of 3 valid species in the Philometrinae from the white sucker in North America is proposed, based on the evidence that before the Pleistocene glaciation there were 3 separate forms of white sucker.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1977	55	9					1430	1441		10.1139/z77-186	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z77-186								907926					WOS:A1977DW99700007

Differences in wetland management influence resource availability for ducks and mortality risk from duck hunting. The local distribution of the Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) is affected by this resource heterogeneity and variable risk from hunting. Regional conservation strategies primarily focus on how waterfowl distributions are affected by food resources during the nonbreeding season. To test if Mallard resource selection was related to the abundance of resources, risks, or a combination, we studied resource selection of adult female Mallards during autumn and winter. We developed a digital spatial layer for Lake St. Clair, Ontario, Canada, that classified resources important to Mallards and assigned these resources a risk level based on ownership type and presumed disturbance from hunting. We monitored 59 individuals with GPS back-pack transmitters prior to, during, and after the hunting season and used discrete choice modeling to generate diurnal and nocturnal resource selection estimates. The model that classified available resources and presumed risk best explained Mallard resource selection strategies. Resource selection varied within and among seasons. Ducks selected for federal, state and private managed wetland complexes that provided an intermediate or relatively greater amount of refuge and foraging options than public hunting areas. Across all diel periods and seasons, there was selection for federally managed marshes and private supplemental feeding refuges that prohibited hunting. Mallard resource selection demonstrated trade-offs related to the management of mortality risk, anthropogenic disturbances, and foraging opportunities. Understanding how waterfowl respond to heterogeneous landscapes of resources and risks can inform regional conservation strategies related to waterfowl distribution during the nonbreeding season.

Hotels, casinos, restaurants, and homeowners dispose large quantities of high-protein, calorie-rich foods, often in unsecured waste containers. We used 173 hair samples from black bears captured in western Nevada from 2003 to 2010 and conducted delta C-13 and delta N-15 analysis to examine anthropogenic food use. We developed a set of a priori models to examine the effect of biological (sex, age class, mass category [considering sex and age]), chronological (season, molt phase, and year), and spatial (urban-wildland classification [UW class]) factors potentially affecting use of anthropogenic foods and accompanying stable isotope signatures. Bears in above-average mass categories had enriched C-13 and N-15 signatures compared with bears of below-average mass. Wildland bears had depleted C-13 compared with urban bears and appeared to use human foods less. Postmolt hair samples (representing late-spring-early summer diet) were depleted in both C-13 and N-15 relative to premolt hairs (late-summer-autumn diet), indicating changes in food availability. Male black bears had enriched N-15 compared with females, indicating more meat in their diet. Our results indicated substantial C-13 and N-15 enrichment of black bear diets in Nevada, which was affected by biological, chronological, and spatial factors. Using mixing models of the 2 isotopes, we found both urban and wildland bears relied on natural and anthropogenic foods, with wildland bears using wild foods more often. There was only 3.8% difference in the median use of human foods between urban and wildland bears, but great variability for individual bears in each location category. Our results affirmed that, to effectively address human-bear conflicts, officials should emphasize exclusion of anthropogenic food attractants on a year-round basis and further try to understand factors affecting individual bear use of garbage.

In addition, mineralogical and grain size compositions were determined. The results show 1) a change in source of carbonate sediment (provenance) through time; 2) the oxygen isotope ratios differed between the ''summer'' and ''winter'' layers of varves couplets due to different rates of sedimentation; 3) anoxic events occurred in the lake; 4) carbon isotope ratios suggest organics in lake sediments which were derived from land and the primary productivity was low in the lake itself. In the study of cold-climatic lake sediments, isotope investigations can efficiently be used as additional paleosedimentological and facies indicators.																			0021-1915						1994	30	1					9	21		10.1080/00211919408046708	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00211919408046708													WOS:A1994PG14300002
J	BABIN, J; PREPAS, EE				BABIN, J; PREPAS, EE			MODELING WINTER OXYGEN DEPLETION RATES IN ICE-COVERED TEMPERATE ZONE LAKES IN CANADA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Winter O2 depletion rates (WODR) (g O2 .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. d[day]-1) were determined for 12 lakes in central Alberta during the winter of 1982-1983. Although dissolved O2 decreased in all lakes for the first 3.5 mo. after freeze-up, the decrease were nonlinear. The highest WODR were observed just after freeze-up. The nonlinear WODR were significantly correlated with 2 estimates of lake productivity (i.e. total P [TP] and chlorophyll a, P < 0.05) but were not significantly correlated with morphometry (e.g., mean depth). When the WODR from the Albertan lakes were treated as linear, to enable a comparison with other studies, correlations were found between WODR and morphometry, and WODR and estimates of summer productivity. These relationships were significantly different from observations by previous investigators who worked on ice-covered lakes in 2 other regions. When data from other ice-covered lakes were combined with this study, WODR were best predicted from a combination of mean summer TP (TPsu in mg .cntdot. m-2) in the euphotic zone and mean depth (.hivin.z in m): WODR = -0.101 + 0.00247TPsu + 0.0134 .hivin.z, r = 0.90. The above equation permits the prediction of WODR for a greater range of lake types than previous models.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1985	42	2					239	249		10.1139/f85-031	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f85-031													WOS:A1985ACG6500004

Evaluating the Fluted Points from Spring Lake, Texas: A Geometric Morphometric Shape Analysis of Clovis Affinity	PALEOAMERICA												The Spring Lake Site (41HY160) in San Marcos, located along the Balcones Escarpment in central Texas, produced fluted points that appear diagnostic of Clovis technology as well as ice-age megafauna remains. Unfortunately, these materials were recovered in what appears to be mixed deposits within the lake itself. For over 40 years, researchers have hypothesized that the points represent Clovis technology and presence at the site. We use a two-dimensional landmark approach to geometric morphometric shape analysis to test the typological context of the artifacts against a dataset of well-dated Clovis point specimens. We examine whether they fall within a morphological range of variation in planview shape documented in point assemblages from Clovis sites organized geographically into the Southwest, Northwest, and Northeast regions. Results suggest that the Spring Lake points possess particular affinity in shape to Clovis points found in the Southwest region.					; Reid, Amy/CAG-1687-2022	Smith, Heather L./0000-0003-1031-0478; 													2055-5563	2055-5571				OCT 2	2022	8	4					340	351		10.1080/20555563.2022.2090728	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20555563.2022.2090728		AUG 2022											WOS:000843089700001

We surveyed major forage fish species in Lake Michigan for their content of thiamine, thiamine vitamers, and thiaminase activity. Concentrations of total thiamine were similar (P <= 0.05) among most forage fishes (alewife Alosa pseudoharengus, bloater Coregonus hoyi, spottail shiner Notropis hudsonius, deepwater sculpin Myoxocephalus thompsonii, yellow perch Perca flavescens, ninespine stickleback Pungitius pungitius, and round goby Neogobius melanostomus) and slightly lower in rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax. Concentrations of total thiamine were all above the dietary requirements of coldwater fishes, suggesting the thiamine content of forage fish is not the critical factor in the development of thiamine deficiency in Lake Michigan salmonines. Thiamine pyrophosphate was the predominant form of thiamine in most species of forage fish, followed by free thiamine and thiamine monophosphate. Total thiamine was slightly greater in summer collections of alewife and rainbow smelt than in spring and fall collections, but the same was not true for bloater. Thiaminase activity varied among species and was greatest in gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum, spottail shiner, alewife, and rainbow smelt. Thiaminase activity in alewife varied among collection locations, season (greatest in spring), and size of the fish. Size and condition factors were positively correlated with both total thiamine and thiaminase activity in alewife. Thus, thiamine and thiaminase activity in forage fishes collected in Lake Michigan varied among species, seasons, year caught, and size (or condition). Therefore, multiple factors must be considered in the development of predictive models for the onset of thiamine deficiency in Great Lakes salmonines. Most importantly, thiaminase activity was great in alewives and rainbow smelt, suggesting that these prey fish are key causative factors of the thiamine deficiency in Great Lakes salmonines.

Courtship behaviour took place with all three animals located among the branches of a small Jack Pine (Pinus banksiana) about 1 m above ground level. Instances of arboreal courtship in Eastern Garter Snakes appear to be most frequent in late summer or early fall in Ontario, and may be related to thermoregulation through direct insolation.

Assessment of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) behaviour and activity at multiple spatial and temporal scales utilizing a whole-lake telemetry array	HYDROBIOLOGIA					6th Conference on Fish Telemetry	JUN 05-11, 2005	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	Univ Evora, Univ Lisbon, Inst Oceanog, Fac Sci				A whole-lake acoustic telemetry array was utilized to monitor the three-dimensional position of 20 largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). Code division multiple access (CDMA) technology enabled the simultaneous monitoring of the 20 transmitters (equipped with pressure and temperature sensors) at 15 s intervals with sub-meter accuracy. Fish were monitored between November 2003 and April 2004 to evaluate the behaviour of fish across different temporal and spatial scales. The distance moved by largemouth bass, assessed both on a daily and hourly basis, varied by season and was positively correlated with water temperature. For example, daily movement rates were 2.69 +/- 1.45 km/day in mid November (average daily water temperature 5.9 degrees C), 2.24 +/- 0.73 km/day in early January (5.1 degrees C), and 7.28 +/- 2.62 km/day in mid April (7.7 degrees C). Interestingly, daily movement rates varied by as much as 25 fold among individual fish. Visualization of fish swimming paths revealed that whereas some fish occupied discrete areas and made only localized movements, other individuals made lengthier journeys covering much of the lake in periods of as little as one day. Analysis of fish behaviour at a finer temporal scale revealed that during the winter, fish spend more than 95% of their time swimming at speeds less than 0.1 m/s (0.07 +/- 0.24 m/s). During late fall, and especially in spring, swimming speeds were higher with mean swimming speeds of 0.11 +/- 0.27 m/s and 0.19 +/- 0.29 m/s, respectively. When the telemetry dataset was queried to simulate 24 h manual tracking intervals, it was clear that manual tracking data would not have been representative of actual daily movement rates, underestimating daily movement and swimming speeds by at least 75 fold. This study identifies the importance of evaluating fish activity at multiple spatial (whole lake to sub-meter position) and temporal (seasonal to seconds) scales and illustrates the potential of CDMA telemetry to yield such data.					; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010	Suski, Cory/0000-0001-8280-873X; Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2007	582						243	256		10.1007/s10750-006-0549-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0549-6													WOS:000245236200023

The case of Lake Maggiore (NW Italy)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A model-based approach is here developed and applied to predict the long-term trends of indirect photochemical processes in the surface layer (5 m water depth) of Lake Maggiore, NW Italy. For this lake, time series of the main parameters of photochemical importance that cover almost two decades are available. As a way to assess the relevant photochemical reactions, the modelled steady-state concentrations of important photogenerated transients ((OH)-O-center dot, (CDOM)-C-3* and CO3-center dot) were taken into account. A multivariate analysis approach was adopted to have an overview of the system, to emphasise relationships among chemical, photochemical and seasonal variables, and to highlight annual and long-term trends. Over the considered time period, because of the decrease of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content of water and of the increase of alkalinity, a significant increase is predicted for the steady-state concentrations of the radicals (OH)-O-center dot and CO3-center dot. Therefore, the photochemical degradation processes that involve the two radical species would be enhanced. Another issue of potential photochemical importance is related to the winter maxima of nitrate (a photochemical (OH)-O-center dot source) and the summer maxima of DOC ((OH)-O-center dot sink and (CDOM)-C-3* source) in the lake water under consideration. From the combination of sunlight irradiance and chemical composition data, one predicts that the processes involving (OH)-O-center dot and CO3-center dot would be most important in spring, while the reactions involving (CDOM)-C-3* would be most important in summer.

Besides, electroprecipitator fly ash (EP-ash) was dechlorinated using the Hagenmeier process and analyzed for congener profiles. In addition to PCNs, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), dibenzofurans (PCDFs), biphenyls (PCBs), and major organochlorine pesticides were determined in ambient air samples from three different sites of western Japan in the summer and winter of 1992. The PCNs from flue gas contained 15,000, 4300, and 13,000 ng/m(3) during start-up, steady operation, and shutdown conditions, respectively. Whereas fly ash contained 470, 370, and 1400 ng/g PCNs under start-up, steady operation, and shutdown condition, respectively. The dechlorination process reduced PCN concentrations considerably. Concentrations of PCNs and PCDD/PCDFs in air samples collected in winter were slightly higher than in summer. PCBs, organochlorine pesticides such as chlordanes, DDTs, and HCHs were higher in summer air samples.

To evaluate the control effects of filter-feeding fish (silver carp and bighead carp) on cyanobacterial blooms, the changes in algal species composition along the fish intestine were analyzed by microscopic examination, chlorophyll fluorescence, high-throughput DNA sequencing and pigment ratios. The microscopic examination results showed that both silver carp and bighead carp have a certain control effect on bloom-forming cyanobacteria in spring. The digestion of silver carp in summer could still effectively remove cyanobacteria and reduce the dominance of Microcystis in the phytoplankton community, while the digestion of bighead carp seemed to have little effect on cyanobacteria. The results of the chlorophyll fluorescence method were similar to those of the microscopic analysis, which indicated that silver carp could reduce the cyanobacterial biomass in spring, while bighead carp could significantly promote the dominance of cyanobacteria (p < 0.001). High-throughput DNA sequencing showed that there were significant differences in filter-feeding plankton between silver carp and bighead carp. The midgut may be the main gathering site of intestinal microorganisms, and cyanobacterial digestion mainly occurs in the intestinal segments between the foregut and midgut. The analysis of pigment ratios indicated that selective digestion of phytoplankton by silver carp significantly reduced the dominance of Cyanophyta in its hindgut (p < 0.01), while bighead carp had the opposite effect (p < 0.05), especially in seasons other than spring. The results of the above four methods are basically the same, that is, the digestion effect of silver carp on cyanobacteria is better than that of bighead carp. Therefore, the stocking proportion of silver carp should be appropriately increased in some meso-eutrophic waterbodies.

Holocene temperatures and isotopes of precipitation in Northwest Greenland recorded in lacustrine organic materials	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Reconstructions of Holocene lake water isotopic composition based upon subfossil aquatic organic material offer new insights into Arctic climate. We present quantitative estimates of warmth during the Holocene Thermal Maximum in northwest Greenland, inferred from oxygen isotopes of chironomid head capsules and aquatic moss preserved in lake sediments. delta O-18 values of chironomids from surface sediments of multiple Greenland lakes indicate that these subfossil remains record the delta O-18 values of the lake water in which they grow. Our lake water delta O-18 reconstruction is supported by downcore agreement with delta O-18 values in aquatic moss and chironomid remains. delta O-18 of both organic materials from Secret Lake decrease after 4 ka (ka = thousands of years ago) by 3 parts per thousand into the Neoglacial. We argue that lake water at Secret Lake primarily reflects precipitation delta O-18 values, which is strongly correlated with air temperature in NW Greenland, and that this signal is biased towards summer and early autumn conditions. Other factors may have influenced Secret Lake delta O-18 values through the Holocene, including evaporation of lake water and changing seasonality and source of precipitation. The maximum early Holocene summer and early autumn-biased temperature anomaly at Secret Lake is 2.5-4 degrees C warmer than present from 7.7 (the beginning of our record) to similar to 6 ka. The maximum late Holocene cold anomaly (which includes the Little Ice Age) is 1.5-3 degrees C colder than present. These ranges of possible temperature anomalies reflect uncertainty in the delta O-18 temperature relationship for precipitation at the study site through the Holocene. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This basin had, at the time of the study, an anaerobic monimolimnion from around 17 m in summer or 21 in winter to 25 m, its maximum depth. However, below this layer a warmer microaerophilic zone with suspended marls is found in a chimney to a depth of 130 m. The rotifer distributions of several years are compared. The presence of large populations of rotifers at the oxic-anoxic interface is constant through the years, but highly variable regarding the total abundance and relative proportions of the species, depending on the importance of the vertical mixing in winter and the posterior segregation of water layers as a function of production and decomposition processes. Filinia hofmanni, Filinia longiseta longiseta are species with a restricted occurrence at the oxycline and are not present in the other non meromictic basins of the lake. Filinia terminalis, more broadly distributed, also has dense populations in summer at the oxycline in basin III, but disappears from the plankton during this season in the other basins. Other species, such as Polyarthra dolichoptera, Anuraeopsis fissa, Keratella cochlearis and Kellicottia longispina, also showed maxima at the oxycline in summer, as well as other maxima in the metalimnion. Populations at the oxycline are probably different ecotypes adapted to low oxygen conditions, but having the advantage of high food availability.																			0018-8158					APR 16	1993	255						371	380		10.1007/BF00025862	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00025862													WOS:A1993LD64400054
J	Vavrus, S; Van Dorn, J				Vavrus, Steve; Van Dorn, Jeff			Projected future temperature and precipitation extremes in Chicago	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Weather extremes have profound societal impacts, and their characteristics are expected to change in the future due to greenhouse forcing. In Chicago, heat waves and cold waves cause more than 100 fatalities per year, while extremely heavy rainfall can trigger disease outbreaks via contaminant discharge of storm water and sewage overflows. Here we analyze statistically downscaled climate model projections of extreme heat, cold, and precipitation in Chicago, based on higher (SRES A1FI) and lower (SRES B1) greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. The frequency, duration, and intensity of heat waves in Chicago are likely to increase substantially, and the heat-wave "season" extended (time during the year when extreme heat occurs). The simulated frequency of hot days-daily maximum temperature (T-max) > 32 degrees C-increases from 15 days/year in the late 20th century to 36 days (B1) to 72 days (A1FI) by the end of this century. Proportionally, a much larger increase (a factor of 4 to 15) is projected in very hot days (T-max>38 degrees C). Conversely, the frequency and intensity of extreme cold is likely to decline considerably during this century. The coldest night of the year is projected to warm by 4-8 degrees C, while the simulated occurrence of very cold conditions (daily minimum temperature< - 18 degrees C) declines by similar to 50% (5 days, B1) to nearly 90% (8 days, A1FI) relative to the late 20th century. Simulated extreme precipitation events generally increase, especially during winter and spring, consistent with the seasonal changes in total precipitation. The projected seasonal changes in atmospheric circulation generally resemble the synoptic weather patterns associated with current extreme events, particularly during spring and summer, suggesting that some of the modeled response of extremes may be driven by mean dynamical changes.

Habitat use of American eel (Anguilla rostrata) in a tributary of the Hudson River, New York	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												American eel Anguilla rostrata populations are declining over much of their native range. Since American eels spend extended periods in freshwater, understanding their habitat requirements while freshwater residents is important for the management and conservation of this species. As there is little information on American eel habitat use in streams, the ontogenetic, diel, and seasonal habitat use as well as habitat selectivity of three size groups (i.e. <= 199 mm total length, 200-399 mm, >= 400 mm) of eel were examined in a tributary of the Hudson River. American eels in Hannacroix Creek exhibited ontogenetic, diel, and seasonal variation in habitat use as well as habitat selection. During both summer and autumn all sizes of American eels used larger substrate and more cover during the day. American eels <= 199 mm exhibited the strongest habitat selection, whereas eels 200-399 mm exhibited the least. During the autumn all sizes of American eels occupied slower depositional areas where deciduous leaf litter accumulated and provided cover. This may have important implications for in-stream and riparian habitat management of lotic systems used by American eel.																			0175-8659					OCT	2013	29	5					1073	1079		10.1111/jai.12253	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jai.12253													WOS:000324067600019

Microcystis aeruginosa was cultured in BG-11 and M-11 mediums, respectively, and a significant relationship between cell density and DNA concentration of Microcystis was found. Then a significant logarithmic relationship between Microcystis growth rate and RNA/DNA ratio was established to measure growth rate of Microcystis by analysis of RNA and DNA content The growth rates calculated by RNA/DNA method were in good agreement with that calculated by the changes of cell density in the whole water column respected with time. The RNA/DNA method was applied in Lake Taihu in summer (1st July) and autumn (1st October), respectively. In summer, the maximum growth rate was 0.361 day(-1) and others were from 0.04 to 0.34 day(-1) with an average value of 0.12, four values were below zero; In autumn, the maximum growth rate was 0.111 day(-1) and most values were below zero. Our results also demonstrated that the growth rate of Microcystis was higher inshore than offshore.					xiao, man/N-2972-2014; Xiao, Man/N-2972-2014; Li, Ming/JPA-5759-2023	Xiao, Man/0000-0003-0021-2129; 													1018-4619	1610-2304					2014	23	4					1100	1106																WOS:000333884800020

(COLEOPTERA, DYTISCIDAE) IN A CENTRAL ALBERTA LAKE	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												There are few studies of life history and population growth of large dytiscid beetles in North America. We sampled populations of Dytiscus alaskanus in a eutrophic lake in north central Alberta weekly in the summers of 1982 and 1983. Like many other temperate zone dytiscids, D. alaskanus has a univoltine life cycle. Dytiscus alaskanus prefers the area at the limit of emergent vegetation in the lake and is most often associated with shoreline vegetation of cattail and sedge. Populations of adult D. alaskanus are at a peak in the late spring and decline throughout the summer. Mark-recapture experiments allowed determination of total population size and monitoring of movement patterns in the lake. Data are discussed with reference to the relatively short summer with which these beetles must cope.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1985	63	6					1316	1323		10.1139/z85-198	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z85-198													WOS:A1985AMX1900016

A stable isotopic study of the diet of Potamonautes sidneyi (Brachyura: Potamonautidae) in two coastal lakes of the iSimangaliso Wetland Park, South Africa	WATER SA												Potamonautes sidneyi Rathbun 1904, is a dominant freshwater crab in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Recent flood events in the iSimangaliso Wetland Park have allowed a substantial range expansion of this species, including previously hypersaline and desiccated areas. A stable isotope study was conducted to examine the feeding habits of the populations from Lake Sibaya and Mpophomeni Stream, two contrasting sites in the iSimangaliso Wetland Park. Juveniles from Mpophomeni Stream were more depleted in delta C-13 and more enriched in delta N-15 compared to adults, indicating a more carnivorous diet and higher trophic position. A general shift in diet was observed at both sites, with consumption of aquatic invertebrates and sedimentary organic matter more prevalent in the wet summer months, while greater proportions of detritus and microphytobenthos were consumed in autumn/winter. No significant difference was observed between adults from the two sites despite the abiotic variations. The species appears to play a complex role in the trophic web, by acting as an intermediate consumer facilitating the flow of nutrients across levels and by breaking down decomposing organic matter, allowing for rapid recycling of nutrients within its ecosystem.

Nitrogen fixation in microbial mat and stromatolite communities from Cuatro Cienegas, Mexico	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Nitrogen fixation (nitrogenase activity, NA) of a microbial mat and a living stromatolite from Cuatro Cienegas, Mexico, was examined over spring, summer, and winter of 2004. The goal of the study was to characterize the diazotrophic community through molecular analysis of the nifH gene and using inhibitors of sulfate reduction and oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis. We also evaluated the role of ultraviolet radiation on the diazotrophic activity of the microbial communities. Both microbial communities showed patterns of NA with maximum rates during the day that decreased significantly with 3-3,4-dichlorophenyl-1',1'-dimethylurea, suggesting the potential importance of heterocystous cyanobacteria. There is also evidence of NA by sulfur-reducing bacteria in both microbial communities suggested by the negative effect exerted by the addition of sodium molybdate. Elimination of infrared and ultraviolet radiation had no effect on NA. Both microbial communities had nifH sequences that related to group I, including cyanobacteria and purple sulfur and nonsulfur bacteria, as well as group II nitrogenases, including sulfur reducing and green sulfur bacteria.					; Falcon, Luisa I/HGU-5682-2022	Eguiarte, Luis E./0000-0002-5906-9737; souza, valeria/0000-0002-2992-4229; Falcon, Luisa I/0000-0002-7210-6483													0095-3628	1432-184X				AUG	2007	54	2					363	373		10.1007/s00248-007-9240-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-007-9240-3								17450393					WOS:000248613600016

Depths and Thermal Habitat Used by Large versus Small Northern Pike in Three Minnesota Lakes	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We monitored depths and temperatures used by large (>71-cm) versus small Northern Pike Esox lucius in three north-central Minnesota lakes with either acoustic telemetry or archival tags. Individual Northern Pike demonstrated flexibility in depths used within a season and between years. The fish had some tolerance for low levels of dissolved oxygen (<3mg/L), but depth selection was generally constrained by low dissolved oxygen in summer and winter. The fish more fully exploited all available depths during winter and thermal turnover periods. During July and August, large Northern Pike tended to follow the thermocline into cooler water as upper water layers warmed. Selection ratios indicated that large Northern Pike preferred water temperatures of 16-21 degrees C during August when temperatures up to 28 degrees C were available. In two lakes providing dense overhead cover from water lilies in shallow water, small Northern Pike used warmer, shallower water compared with large fish during summer. In a third lake providing no such cover, small fish were more often in deeper, cooler water. For small Northern Pike, temperature seemed to be a secondary habitat consideration behind the presence of shallow vegetated cover. This study provided detailed temperature selection information that will be useful when considering temperature as an ecological resource for different sizes of Northern Pike.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				NOV 1	2013	142	6					1629	1639		10.1080/00028487.2013.822422	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2013.822422													WOS:000327469700012
J	Shuman, B; Huang, YS; Newby, P; Wang, Y				Shuman, Bryan; Huang, Yongsong; Newby, Paige; Wang, Yi			Compound-specific isotopic analyses track changes in seasonal precipitation regimes in the Northeastern United States at ca 8200cal yrBP	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We analyzed the hydrogen isotopic composition of sedimentary leaf wax (C(28) n-acid) and palmitic acid (C(16) n-acid) in cores from Berry and Crooked Ponds in Massachusetts. The results show a dramatic positive shift in leaf wax delta D values around 8200 cal yr BP, when regional lake levels rose and plant communities shifted in favor of plants intolerant of dry conditions. To aid our interpretation, we studied modern lake sediment samples and found that the delta D values of leaf wax and palmitic acid record the hydrogen isotopic composition of water available during the synthesis of these compounds. Palmitic acid delta D values follow lake water values often derived from winter precipitation, and leaf wax delta D values track the water available to terrestrial plants during the growing season. Based on these results, we interpret the downcore isotopic shift as an increase in the fraction of precipitation falling during the growing season. The increase coincides with evidence from pollen and palmitic acid delta D values for a multi-century period of cold conditions at ca 8200 cal yr BP. The close timing of the brief cool period and a step-change in summer precipitation levels in the northeastern United States is consistent with the hypothesis that the collapse of the Laurentide ice sheet occurred in association with cold North Atlantic conditions from 8400 to 8000 cal yr BP. The location of the northeastern US downwind of the ice sheet and close to the North Atlantic makes it sensitive to both factors. Our results also provide insight into later changes in the northeastern US because they indicate a progressive decrease in summer precipitation levels after ca 8000 cal yr BP. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Scott, JD				Scott, John D.			Studies abound on how far north Ixodes scapularis ticks are transported by birds	TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES												Several studies report migratory songbirds transporting ticks northward during spring migration in Canada. The blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis, has been documented on Neotropical songbirds as far as Slave Lake, Alberta during northbound spring migration. In addition, Ixodes ticks have been collected from passerine migrants as far north as Watson Lake, Yukon (north of 60th latitude). The presence of Amblyomma ticks parasitizing long-distance migrants, which are moving from wintering grounds in the Neotropics to breeding grounds in Canada, confirms Neotropical songbirds transport ixodid ticks into Canada. Our avian, tick-host studies document 22 species of ticks on wild birds in Canada, and the majority of these species are not indigenous in Canada. Some of these songbird-transported ticks originate from as far south as Brazil. Clearly, passerine migrants transport ticks long distances into Canada during northward spring migration. The importation of ticks into Canada by migratory songbirds is no longer a "hypothesis," it is a fact. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

However, the difference of sediment microbial communities between wetlands and deep-water ecosystems is still unclear. We combined 16S rRNA gene sequencing and community metabolic prediction to compare sediment microbial communities and predicted metabolic genes of wetlands (natural and constructed wetlands) and deep-water ecosystems (river and lake) along with environmental factors in summer and autumn in Dongping Lake Basin. Results showed that the deep-water ecosystems had significantly higher community richness than the wetlands in autumn in the freshwater basin, which was mostly related to the pH of sediments. However, no significant difference in community richness was found in summer. Besides, the composition of both predicted metabolic genes and microbial communities was significantly affected by dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved oxygen (DO). The wetlands exhibited high predicted gene abundances related to xenobiotic biodegradation possibly due to the high DOC or DO level. Compared with the wetlands, most of the deep-water ecosystems exhibited high predicted gene abundances related to element (carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur) metabolism possibly due to the low DOC and DO levels in the freshwater basin. This study can expand the knowledge of ecological function distribution and detoxification mechanism of microbial communities in freshwater ecosystems.					; Liu, Jian/T-1760-2017; Li, Changchao/JXM-3646-2024; Cao, Qingqing/ACO-1149-2022	Li, Changchao/0000-0002-3943-6413; Liu, Jian/0000-0003-1920-2641; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2020	27	16			SI		19661	19677		10.1007/s11356-020-08446-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-08446-4		MAR 2020						32221828					WOS:000521926200003

AHOD ranged from 0.222 to 0.522 g O2 .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. d-1 over four summers and AWOD ranged from 0.354 to 0.614 g O2 .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. d-1 over three winters. AHOD was positively correlated with maximum storage of dissolved oxygen (O2) at the onset of summer thermal stratification (P < 0.05). Similarly, AWOD was higher in years when mixing was more complete and maximum O2 storage at freeze-up was higher. These results suggest that the prediction of O2 depletion rates for lakes with year-to-year variation in maximum O2 storage can be improved if maximum O2 storage after lake mixing is considered in addition to other factors known to influence O2 depletion rates such as lake productivity and morphometry.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				MAR	1988	45	3					571	576		10.1139/f88-069	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f88-069													WOS:A1988M741200023

Adult R. cascadilla and R. rotundicaudatum appeared in large numbers in late spring. Females of both species matured quickly and contained embryonated eggs in June and July. Prevalence and intensity of R. cascadilla tapered off throughout the summer but never reached zero. Prevalence and intensity of R. rotundicaudatum decreased rapidly through the summer and only one adult was recovered after August 1. Rapid acquisition of worms by fish in late spring seems to be facilitated by the convergence of the intermediate and definitive hosts in space and time. Convergence with common shiner and the intermediate host of R. rotundicaudatum, Ephemera simulans Walker, 1853 (Ephemeroptera), occurs in the stream riffle areas during late May and early June. Results suggest that the intermediate host of R. cascadilla and the common shiner also converge during the spring, but because the intermediate host of R. cascadilla was not found, this could not be confirmed. Also, the presence and rapid maturation of adult R. rotundicaudatum are probably related to their acquisition as adults from the mayfly intermediate host. These findings support the hypothesis that the presence of precocial nematode parasites in the intermediate host represents a transmission strategy that accelerates gametogenesis in the final host in order to take advantage of the limited time and space available for transmission.

Seasonal changes in the structure of the anoxygenic photosynthetic bacterial community in Lake Shunet, Khakassia	MICROBIOLOGY												Seasonal studies of the anoxygenic phototrophic bacterial community of the water column of the saline eutrophic meromictic Lake Shunet (Khakassia) were performed in 2002 (June) and 2003 (February-March and August). From the redox zone down, the lake water was of dark green color. Green sulfur bacteria predominated in every season. The maximum number of green sulfur bacteria was 10(7) cells/ml in summer and 10(6) cells/ml in winter. A multi-syringe stratification sampler was applied for the study of the fine vertical distribution of phototrophs in August 2003; the sampling was performed every 5 cm. A 5-cm-thick pink-colored water layer inhabited by purple sulfur bacteria was shown to be located above the layer of green bacteria. The species composition and ratio of purple bacterial species depended on the sampling depth and on the season. In summer, the number of purple sulfur bacteria in the layer of pink water was 1.6 x 10(8) cells/ml. Their number in winter was 3 x 10(5) cells/ml. In the upper oxygen-containing layer of the chemocline the cells of purple nonsulfur bacteria were detected in summer. The maximum number of nonsulfur purple bacteria, 5 x 10(2) cells/ml, was recorded in August 2003. According to the results of the phylogenetic analysis of pure cultures of the isolated phototrophic bacteria, which were based on 16S rDNA sequencing, green sulfur bacteria were close to Prosthecochloris vibrioformis, purple sulfur bacteria, to Thiocapsa and Halochromatium species, and purple nonsulfur bacteria, to Rhodovulum euryhalinum and Pinkicyclus mahoneyensis.

Quantifying national and regional cyanobacterial occurrence in US lakes using satellite remote sensing	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms are the most common form of harmful algal blooms in freshwater systems throughout the world. However, in situ sampling of cyanobacteria in inland lakes is limited both spatially and temporally. Satellite data has proven to be an effective tool to monitor cyanobacteria in freshwater lakes across the United States. This study uses data from the European Space Agency Envisat MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer and the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument to provide a national overview of the percentage of lakes experiencing a cyanobacterial bloom on a weekly basis for 2008-2011, 2017, and 2018. A total of 2321 lakes across the contiguous United States were included in the analysis. We examined four different thresholds to define when a waterbody is classified as experiencing a bloom. Across these four thresholds, we explored variability in bloom percentage with changes in seasonality and lake size. As a validation of algorithm performance, we analyzed the agreement between satellite observations and previously established ecological patterns, although data availability in the wintertime limited these comparisons on a year-round basis. Changes in cyanobacterial bloom percentage at the national scale followed the well-known temporal pattern of freshwater blooms. The percentage of lakes experiencing a bloom increased throughout the year, reached a maximum in fall, and decreased through the winter. Wintertime data, particularly in northern regions, were consistently limited due to snow and ice cover. With the exception of the Southeast and South, regional patterns mimicked patterns found at the national scale. The Southeast and South exhibited an unexpected pattern as cyanobacterial bloom percentage reached a maximum in the winter rather than the summer. Lake Jesup in Florida was used as a case study to validate this observed pattern against field observations of chlorophyll a. Results from this research establish a baseline of annual occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in inland lakes across the United States. In addition, methods presented in this study can be tailored to fit the specific requirements of an individual system or region.

Longitudinal monitoring of honey bee colonies reveals dynamic nature of virus abundance and indicates a negative impact of Lake Sinai virus 2 on colony health	PLOS ONE												Honey bees (Apis mellifera) are important pollinators of plants, including those that produce nut, fruit, and vegetable crops. Therefore, high annual losses of managed honey bee colonies in the United States and many other countries threaten global agriculture. Honey bee colony deaths have been associated with multiple abiotic and biotic factors, including pathogens, but the impact of virus infections on honey bee colony population size and survival are not well understood. To further investigate seasonal patterns of pathogen presence and abundance and the impact of viruses on honey bee colony health, commercially managed colonies involved in the 2016 California almond pollination event were monitored for one year. At each sample date, colony health and pathogen burden were assessed. Data from this 50-colony cohort study illustrate the dynamic nature of honey bee colony health and the temporal patterns of virus infection. Black queen cell virus, deformed wing virus, sacbrood virus, and the Lake Sinai viruses were the most readily detected viruses in honey bee samples obtained throughout the year. Analyses of virus prevalence and abundance revealed pathogen-specific trends including the overall increase in deformed wing virus abundance from summer to fall, while the levels of Lake Sinai virus 2 (LSV2) decreased over the same time period. Though virus prevalence and abundance varied in individual colonies, analyses of the overall trends reveal correlation with sample date. Total virus abundance increased from November 2015 (post-honey harvest) to the end of the almond pollination event in March 2016, which coincides with spring increase in colony population size. Peak total virus abundance occurred in late fall (August and October 2016), which correlated with the time period when the majority of colonies died. Honey bee colonies with larger populations harbored less LSV2 than weaker colonies with smaller populations, suggesting an inverse relationship between colony health and LSV2 abundance.

Littoral eutrophication indicators are more closely related to nearshore land use than to water nutrient concentrations: A critical evaluation of stressor-response relationships	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Biological assessment metrics and water chemistry measurements are used to quantify the link between stressors and their effects on lake ecosystems, for the Water Framework Directive. However, correlations between metrics and water chemistry are often poor. This is seen as major weaknesses of Water Framework Directive-related monitoring and assessment. We analyzed macrophytes, benthic algae, benthic macroinvertebrates, water chemistry and sediment total phosphorus content in the littoral of six lakes in the Western Balkans and used CORINE land use data to estimate nutrient enrichment via runoff from the adjacent land. Lakes with a higher estimated phosphorus runoff from the adjacent land did not have higher littoral water nutrient concentrations, but littoral diatom assemblages indicated more eutrophic conditions. These lakes also had higher abundances of littoral benthic primary producers, which in turn were associated with low concentrations of dissolved nutrients, but only in autumn, not in spring. This is consistent with primary producers taking up nutrients during the summer growth season. In lakes with high abundances of benthic primary producers, it is likely that the littoral vegetation plays a large role in the transfer of nutrients from the water to the benthos. This process impairs correlations between biological metrics and water nutrient concentrations. Our results suggest that CORINE land cover may be more useful to characterize littoral nutrient enrichment than lake water chemistry. Increased benthic primary producer biomasses and "eutrophic" diatom indices may indicate littoral nutrient enrichment even if water nutrient concentrations are low. (C) 2020 The Authors.

For all years, evaporation rates were low in spring and fall and highest during the summer. However, the times of highest evaporation rates varied during the 6 yr. Evaporation reached maximum rates in July for three of the years, in June for two of the years, and in August for one of the years. The highest evaporation rate during the 6-yr study was 0.46 cm d(-1) during 27 May-4 June 1986 and 15-21 July 1987. Solar radiation and atmospheric radiation input to the lake and long-wave radiation emitted from the lake were by far the largest energy fluxes to and from the lake and had the greatest effect on evaporation rates. Energy advected to and from the lake by precipitation, surface water, and ground water had little effect on evaporation rates. In the energy-budget method, average evaporation rates are determined for energy-budget periods, which are bounded by the dates of thermal surveys of the lake. Our study compared evaporation rates calculated for short periods, usually similar to1 week, with evaporation rates calculated for longer periods, usually similar to2 weeks. The results indicated that the shorter periods showed more variability in evaporation rates, but seasonal patterns, with few exceptions, were similar.					; Rosenberry, Donald/C-2241-2013	Rosenberry, Donald/0000-0003-0681-5641; 													0024-3590					MAY	2003	48	3					995	1009		10.4319/lo.2003.48.3.0995	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2003.48.3.0995													WOS:000182982300005

Seasonal shifts in the diet of lake zooplankton revealed by phospholipid fatty acid analysis	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												We analysed the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles of seston and of the dominant zooplankter, Daphnia longispina, through the open water period in a small, dystrophic lake to investigate seasonal variation in the diet of Daphnia. Phytoplankton, heterotrophic bacteria, green sulphur bacteria and methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) were all present in the water column of the lake, and previous studies have indicated that vertically migrating Daphnia can exploit all these potential food sources. For adult Daphnia, although there was some correspondence between the PLFA profile of Daphnia and the concurrent seston PLFA profile, strongest correlations were between the Daphnia PLFA profile and those of potential food sources determined 7 days earlier. This interval presumably reflects the time it takes for adult Daphnia to turn over their fatty acid pool. A correlation between the concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the epi- and metalimnion and measured primary production indicated that, within the total PLFA fraction, PUFAs can be useful biomarkers for phytoplankton in food-web studies. Algal PUFAs contributed appreciably to total PLFAs in adult Daphnia during spring and summer, but less so in autumn. Daphnia in the lake actually reached their highest biomass in autumn, when methanotrophic activity was also highest, and the highest magnitude of MOB-specific PLFAs was recorded in both adult and juvenile Daphnia. A strong relationship existed between delta C-13 values of Daphnia reported previously and the proportion of MOB-specific PLFAs in Daphnia. Autumnal mixing evidently stimulates bacterial oxidation of methane from the hypolimnion, and exploitation of the methanotrophic bacteria sustains a high Daphnia population late in the season. Our results show that the PLFA composition of freshwater zooplankton like Daphnia corresponds rather well to that of their in situ diet of phytoplankton and bacteria, with a lag period of around 1 week in the case of adult animals. The PLFA profile of seston revealed the dominant available food sources, and relating these to the Daphnia PLFA profile provided insights into seasonal changes in Daphnia diet.

We tested hypotheses on the relationship between species richness and environmental conditions including environmental extremes, nutrient status, and day length. On the basis of the unique environment that exists in these high-latitude lakes, we expected that novel taxa would be present. Alpha diversity analyses showed that extreme conditions-that is, high salinity, low oxygen, and extreme changes in day length-did not impact ciliate richness; however, ciliate richness was 30% higher in samples with higher dissolved organic matter. Beta diversity analyses revealed that ciliate communities clustered by dissolved oxygen, depth, and salinity, but not by season (i.e., day length). The permutational analysis of variance test indicated that depth, dissolved oxygen, and salinity had significant influences on the ciliate community for the abundance matrices of resampled data, while lake and season were not significant. This result suggests that the vertical trends in dissolved oxygen concentration and salinity may play a critical role in structuring ciliate communities. A PCR-based strategy capitalizing on divergent eukaryotic V9 hypervariable region ribosomal RNA gene targets unveiled two new genera in these lakes. A novel taxon belonging to an unknown class most closely related to Cryptocaryon irritans was also inferred from separate gene phylogenies.					; Vick-Majors, Trista/AAQ-6258-2020	Morgan-kiss, Rachael/0000-0003-4783-5358; Vick-Majors, Trista/0000-0002-6868-4010; 													0006-3185	1939-8697				OCT	2014	227	2					175	190		10.1086/BBLv227n2p175	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/BBLv227n2p175								25411375					WOS:000345447800008
J	Melaas, CL; Zimmer, KD; Butler, MG; Hanson, MA				Melaas, CL; Zimmer, KD; Butler, MG; Hanson, MA			Effects of rotenone on aquatic invertebrate communities in prairie wetlands	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We assessed the effects of rotenone on aquatic invertebrate communities by comparing four prairie wetlands treated with rotenone to four control sites. Data collected one week before and three weeks after treatment in the fall of 1998 were paired to assess short-term effects, while data collected in spring 1998 and spring 1999 were paired to assess longer-term effects and recovery rates. Data were collected on 14 taxa of benthic invertebrates collected in Ekman grab samples, and 23 taxa of planktonic-nektonic invertebrates collected in water-column samples. Each data set was analyzed separately with redundancy analysis to assess effects in the two habitats sampled. Significant short-term effects were detected on invertebrates in the water column and abundance of several taxonomic groups declined sharply after treatment. The greatest declines were observed in zooplankton abundance; effects on macroinvertebrates were much less pronounced. Suppression of water-column taxa was short-lived, as significant effects were no longer evident during May 1999. In contrast, no significant short-term effect was evident in the benthic taxa. Our results indicate that fall applications of rotenone may briefly suppress plankton communities, but effects are short-lived. From a fisheries management perspective, fall applications may minimize effects on invertebrate communities and facilitate rapid recovery.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP 1	2001	459						177	186		10.1023/A:1012514124430	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1012514124430													WOS:000173248900018

L. Ciso is a peculiar system because it is completely anoxic during mixing and has a sulfide-rich hypolimnion during stratification. Two questions were addressed: whether in this particular lake succession of populations conformed to established models, and how did biomass allocation into different trophic groups change with time. The community was characterized by the presence of purple phototrophic bacteria. A metalimnetic peak of Cryptomonas phaseolus (up to 10(5) cells ml-1) developed above a layer of phototrophic bacteria in the metalimnion. The ciliate Coleps hirtus (up to 7 x 10(3) cells ml-1) and the rotifer Anuraeopsis fissa (up to 500 ind ml-1) formed maxima just above the cryptomonad layer. Some phototrophic protists grew at the surface and some anaerobic ciliates were present in the upper hypolimnion. The whole lake was dominated by prokaryotes during the winter but eukaryotes could account for up to 75% of the biomass, on an areal basis, in summer. Despite large seasonal changes in community composition, the total amount of chemotrophic biomass was always lower (ranging from 25 to 50% of the total) than phototrophic biomass. Occasionally, rotifers explained 50% of the chemotrophic biomass in summer, while ciliates and copepods constituted 15-30% and 5-20%, respectively. Bacteria formed only 10-20% of the chemotrophic biomass in summer, but they accounted for almost 100% during winter holomixis. The epilimnetic community conformed to the PEG-model (SOMMER et al. 1986), following the typical succession of populations, but the metalimnetic community remained constant throughout the summer, thus departing from the PEG model. In order to account for lakes with important metalimnetic communities, therefore, this model will need additional statements.

Loch McNess is in a National Park, Lake Joondalup is in an area becoming urbanized and Lake Monger is in a suburb near the center of Perth. Monthly measurements were made of phytoplankton numbers and environmental parameters, including forms of N and P. Populations tended to be high when lake levels were low. Phytoplankton numbers were dominated by blue-green ''algae'' in summer in each lake, with the lowest numbers in Loch McNess. Green algae were most prominent in autumn and winter. Diatoms were present at relatively lower numbers throughout the year. Phytoplankton numbers were strongly correlated with P levels, particularly for blue-green algae, and less so with N. Green algae were also strongly correlated with water conductivity. Nearly 80% of variance in phytoplankton numbers was accounted for in multiple linear regression by temperature, sunlight hours, depth, pH, conductivity and phosphate, organic P, ammonia, nitrate-nitrite, and organic N concentrations. Much of the variance was accounted for by the nutrients alone. Comparisons with data in the literature suggest that Lakes Joondalup and Monger are eutrophic by world standards and are far more eutrophic than Loch McNess.

J	ELMOSLIMANY, AP				ELMOSLIMANY, AP			THE LATE PLEISTOCENE CLIMATES OF THE LAKE ZERIBAR REGION (KURDISTAN, WESTERN IRAN) DEDUCED FROM THE ECOLOGY AND POLLEN PRODUCTION OF NON-ARBOREAL VEGETATION	VEGETATIO												The concept of an arid pleniglacial in the Middle East depends primarily on the interpretation of pollen diagrams including those of Lake Zeribar in the Zagros Mountains of western Iran. It has been assumed that Lake Zeribar was surrounded by a Chenopodiaceae-Artemisia steppe and that the climate was therefore dry. Both assumptions are questioned. The environment of Pleistocene Lake Zeribar may have been similar to the tragacanthic or alpine zone of the modern Zagros Mountains. The dominance by pollen of Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia is explained by low pollen production of high-altitude vegetation, preferential incorporation of pollen of late-blooming plants into the sediments, and high production and long-distance transport of lowland pollen. In any case, high percentages of Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia pollen do not necessarily indicate low annual precipitation but a highly seasonal climate with cold winters and hot, dry summers. Such a climatic regime was in effect continuous except for a period beginning about 10,600 B.P. during which summer rainfall or reduced summer drought occurred. This change in seasonality resulted in the dominance of Poaceae pollen and the initial increase in arboreal pollen. A moisture curve based on the ratio between Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia pollen indicates a pleniglacial climate with wet winters and a late-glacial and early-Holocene climate with periods of intense aridity. The climatic history presented here is compatible with non-palynological evidence of regional late Pleistocene climates and with seasonality changes suggested by climatic modelling based on orbital parameters.																			0042-3106					NOV 15	1987	72	3					131	139																WOS:A1987L142100001

Climate change projections for lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) recruitment in the 1836 Treaty Waters of the Upper Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) is an ecologically, culturally, and economically important species in the Laurentian Great lakes. Lake whitefish have been a staple food source for thousands of years and, since 1980, have supported the most economically valuable (annual catch value approximate to US$16.6 million) and productive (annual harvest approximate to 7 million kg) commercial fishery in the upper Great Lakes (Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior). Climate changes, specifically changes in temperature, wind, and ice cover, are expected to impact the ecology, production dynamics, and value of this fishery because the success of recruitment to the fishery has been linked with these climatic variables. We used linear regression to determine the relationship between fall and spring air temperature indices, fall wind speed, winter ice cover, and lake whitefish recruitment in 13 management units located in the 1836 Treaty Waters of the Upper Great Lakes ceded by the Ottawa and Chippewa nations, a culturally and commercially important region for the lake whitefish fishery. In eight of the 13 management units evaluated, models including one or more climate variables (temperature, wind, ice cover) explained significantly more variation in recruitment than models with only the stock-recruitment relationship, using corrected Akaike's Information Criterion comparisons (Delta AICc > 3). Isolating the climate-recruitment relationship and projecting recruitment with the Coupled Hydrosphere-Atmosphere Research Model (CHARM) indicated the potential for increased lake whitefish recruitment in the majority of the 1836 Treaty Waters management units. These results can inform adaptive management strategies by providing anticipated implications of climate on lake whitefish recruitment.

Examination of the seasonal and semi-long-term variations, gas-particle partitioning and implications for long-range atmospheric transport	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												This study presents multi-year monitoring data on atmospheric polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in central Europe. Air was sampled on a weekly basis at a background site in the central Czech Republic from 2011 to 2014 (N = 114). Sigma 8PBDEs (without BDE209) total (gas and particulate) concentrations ranged from 0.084 to 6.08 pg m(-3), while BDE209 was at 0.05-5.01 pg m(-3). BDE47, BDE99 and BDE183 were the major contributors to Sigma 8PBDEs. Overall, the atmospheric concentrations of individual PBDEs were controlled by deposition processes, meteorological parameters and long-range atmospheric transport. Regarding gas particle partitioning, with the exception of BDE28 (gaseous) and BDE209 (particulate), all congeners were consistently detected in both phases. Clear seasonal variations with significantly higher measured particulate fraction (theta(measured)) in winter compared to summer was found for all PBDEs except BDE209. For example, while the average theta(measured) of BDE47 was 0.53 +/- 0.19 in winter, this was only 0.01 +/- 0.02 in summer. Similarly, for BDE99, theta(measured) was 0.89 +/- 0.13 in winter, while it was only 0.12 +/- 0.08 in summer. The observed gas-particle partitioning coefficient (K-p, in m(3) mu g(-1)) was compared with three model predictions, assuming equilibrium or a steady state. None of the models could provide a satisfactory prediction of the partitioning, suggesting the need for a universally applicable model. Statistically significant decreases of the atmospheric concentrations during 2011-2014 were found for BDE99, 100, 153 and 209. Estimated apparent atmospheric halving times for these congeners ranged from 2.8 (BDE209) to 4.8 (BDE153) years. The results suggest that photolytic debromination to lower brominated congeners may significantly influence PBDE concentration levels and patterns in the atmosphere.

Analysis of spring blooms and whiting events in Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Benthic monitoring by USGS off the southern shore of Lake Ontario from October 1993 to October 1995 provides a detailed view of the early stages of the decline of the native amphipod Diporeia. A loss of the 1994 and 1995 year classes of Diporeia preceded the disappearance of the native amphipod at sites near Oswego and Rochester at depths from 55 to 130 m. In succeeding years, Diporeia populations continued to decline in Lake Ontario and were nearly extirpated by 2008. Explanations for Diporeia's decline in the Great Lakes include several hypotheses often linked to the introduction and expansion of exotic zebra and quagga mussels (Dreissena sp.). We compare the timeline of the Diporeia decline in Lake Ontario with trends in two sources of organic matter to the sediments - spring diatom blooms and late summer whiting events. The 1994-95 decline of Diporeia coincided with localized dreissenid effects on phytoplankton in the nearshore and a year (April 1994 to May 1995) of decreased flux of organic carbon recorded by sediment traps moored offshore of Oswego. Later declines of profundal (>90 m) Diporeia populations in 2003 were poorly associated with trends in spring algal blooms and late summer whiting events.

J	Tokano, T				Tokano, Tetsuya			Paleoclimate of Titan with hydrocarbon oceans and continents simulated by a global climate model	ICARUS												Titan's paleoclimate in the presence of hypothetical hydrocarbon oceans 1 Gyr ago is simulated by a global climate model with a slab ocean model. Simulations are run for two different ocean compositions and with and without continents. The climate over ethane-rich oceans is dry with respect to methane but is windier than over methane-rich oceans. Continents do not substantially change the climate if the ocean is ethane-rich but continents are somewhat windier than the oceans for orographic reasons. The climate over methane-rich oceans is very moist but calm as long as there are no continents. Global imbalance between the N2 release from the ocean in spring and N2 absorption by the ocean in autumn due to the temperature dependence of the N2 solubility in the ocean causes a semi-annual variation in global-mean surface pressure by similar to 0.1 hPa. Continents surrounded by methane-rich oceans induce a sea breeze circulation in summer due to a sea-land temperature contrast. The sea breeze causes intense orographic precipitation on windward slopes of continents.

J	PETERSON, SR; ELLARSON, RS				PETERSON, SR; ELLARSON, RS			FOOD-HABITS OF OLD-SQUAWS WINTERING ON LAKE-MICHIGAN	WILSON BULLETIN												The food habits of oldsquaws wintering on Lake Michigan [Michigan, USA] were examined from material collected in 2 periods: 1951-1954 and 1969-1972. Grit averaged 25% of total contents in the earlier sample, and 90% of all grit was sand. Animal food constituted about 99% by volume of the food organisms present in the 1951-1954 sample. The principal food item was an amphipod Pontoporeia affinis which occurred in 52-96% of the earlier sample and in 88-95% of the 1969-1972 sample. Clams occurred frequently in both samples but the volume ingested was relatively low. The occurrence of fish and fish eggs in the diet varied with the locality and individual flocks. Oldsquaws are related to the coregonid fishery in Lake Michigan through the common food organism P. affinis. Oldsquaws will also eat fish eggs when available. The decline in oldsquaw carcass lipids during the winter may be related to a decrease in the volume of food ingested during that period, but a rise in the volume of ingested food during early spring does not appear to be associated with a premigratory increase in lipid deposition. Oldsquaws apparently decrease their feeding activity just prior to migration and do not resume heavy feeding while on spring migration.																			0043-5643						1977	89	1					81	91																WOS:A1977DC61000008

In both lakes after the spring blooms of centric diatoms (10-12 mg .cntdot. dm-3) the biomass in summer decreases to 1-2 mg .cntdot. dm-3 and green algae, xanthophytes, dinoflagellates, cryptomonads dominate. Heating increases destruction and accelerates seasonal succession of phytoplankton. The main post-discharge current in Lake Slesinskie has species found in eutrophic rivers, whereas in the region of water cooling and downwelling buoying species (blue-green algae and large dinoflagellates) assemble. Because of low water retention in Lake Goslawskie the diatoms occur abundantly even in summer.																			0070-9557						1988	36	1-2					183	202																WOS:A1988U315900010
J	Ran, M; Feng, ZD				Ran, Min; Feng, Zhaodong			Holocene moisture variations across China and driving mechanisms: A synthesis of climatic records	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Based on the review of 33 Holocene moisture reconstructions that passed quality scrutiny, temporal and spatial patterns of regional moisture variations are delineated. The regionally-averaged moisture index from Xinjiang demonstrates that the moisture index has been persistently climbing since similar to 10 ka cal BP and that the period between similar to 4 and similar to 0 ka cal BP is the Holocene Moisture Optimum. Comparison of the moisture index of Xinjiang region with the winter climate of northern Europe leads us to propose that the Holocene moisture variations in Xinjiang region have been controlled by the winter temperature variations in the North Atlantic region. The regionally-averaged moisture index from the Tibetan Plateau shows that the moisture has been persistently declining since similar to 11 ka cal BP and that the period between similar to 11.5 and 7.5 ka cal BP was the Holocene Moisture Optimum. The parallel trends between the moisture level in the Tibetan Plateau and the Indian summer monsoon strength retrieved from the Arabian Sea suggest that the Tibetan Plateau has been under influence of the Indian summer monsoon throughout the Holocene. The regionally-averaged moisture index curves from Northern China and Southern China are the delayed reflections of the East Asian summer monsoon strength to the solar radiation. That is, the peak insolation was responded by the Holocene "Oceanic Thermal Optimum" with significant time lags and the "Oceanic Thermal Optimum" was then responded by the "Holocene Moisture Optimum" in southern China and northern China also with some time lags. The differences in the moisture-index curve shapes and in the durations of the "Holocene Moisture Optimum" between northern China and southern China suggest that the strength of the East Asian summer monsoon had gradually transgressed northward in the early Holocene and gradually regressed southward in the late Holocene.

Wind generation is expected to play a major role in achieving this target. However, there is limited public data on current and potential wind generation. We use the Renewables.ninja model to simulate wind output at 44 wind farm sites in New Zealand over a 20-year period. We make our data publicly available and use them to analyse New Zealand's wind resources. We find the long-run average capacity factors over all current and potential sites is 40%. It is lowest in autumn (around 35%) and highest in spring (around 45%). Output is similar across all demand percentiles with little correlation between wind output and demand. A small positive correlation exists between wind output and daily inflows into hydro storage dams. A more significant positive correlation exists between wind output and inflows in the period leading up to winter (when lake levels are typically lowest), implying that wind cannot help energy shortfall during dry years. Finally, we explore how much wind capacity must be installed to give a 100% renewable electricity system, and the trade-offs between energy storage and spilling wind for achieving this target.																			0960-1481	1879-0682				JUN	2021	170						449	461		10.1016/j.renene.2021.01.053	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2021.01.053		FEB 2021											WOS:000632050500007

Wood) were collected from an oospore bank in the sediments of Lake George, New York, [USA]. Incubated at constant temperatures, all or nearly all of the oospores germinated when exposed to a brief pulse of red light when the annual window of germinability was open. The window seems related to the annual cycle of sediment temperatures. It is open in spring and closes with the onset of a secondary dormancy in the summer. Oospores in storage follow a parallel path if held at 18.degree. C, a summer equivalent temperature; the window remains open indefinitely if the oospores are held at 4.degree. C. Attention is drawn to the similarity of the cyclic window of germinability in seeds of summer annuals and oospores of N. furcata.																			0022-3646	1529-8817				SEP	1986	22	3					403	406		10.1111/j.1529-8817.1986.tb00044.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1529-8817.1986.tb00044.x													WOS:A1986D958300022

ThSSim is a simple and flexible reduced-order model-based the basis function (RMBF) that combines CE-QUAL-W2 (W2) and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). In a case study, it was used to simulate water temperature in the Karkheh Reservoir (KR), Iran, for the period 2019-2035. ThSSim consists of two space- and time-dependent components that add predictive ability to the RMBF, a major refinement that extends its practical applications. Water temperature simulations by the W2 model at three-hour time intervals for the KR were used as input data to the POD model to develop ThSSim. To add predictive ability to ThSSim and considering that space-dependent components are not a function of time, we extrapolated the first three time-dependent components by September 30, 2035. We checked the predictive ability of ThSSim against water temperature profiles measured during eight sampling campaigns. We then applied ThSSim to simulate water temperature in the KR for 2019-2035. Simulated water temperature values matched well those measured and obtained by W2. ThSSim results showed an increasing trend for surface water temperature during the simulation period, with a reverse trend observed for water temperature in the bottom layers for three seasons (spring, summer and autumn). The results also indicated decreasing and increasing trends in onset and breakdown of thermal stability, respectively, so that the duration of ThS increased from 278 days in 2019 to 293 days in 2035. ThSSim is thus useful for reservoir temperature simulations. Moreover, the approach used to develop ThSSim is widely applicable to other fields of science and engineering.

Assessment of management options for Salsola australis in south-west Australia by transition matrix modelling	WEED RESEARCH												P>A matrix model of the life cycle of Salsola australis was constructed, based on population ecology data collected from the district of Lake Grace, Western Australia. The model was used to assess potential control strategies for this summer annual weed within the Western Australian broad acre grain cropping system. The population growth rate (lambda) of S. australis in the absence of weed control strategies was 1.49 and was virtually unaffected by the dormant seedbank. However, lambda increased to 8.21 if it was assumed that a constant number of seed immigrated into the area in question from neighbouring populations of S. australis, through farm-scale seed dispersal. As a result, effective weed management depended on reducing seed dispersal. The model determined that burning all senesced, mobile plants in late autumn, combined with herbicide control of the largest cohorts of S. australis in summer and autumn, reduced population growth rate to 0.79. This control strategy resulted in a 66.1% chance of the population becoming extinct over 25 years. Management strategies are proposed based on the results of the models and further research is required to validate their effectiveness and practicality in the field.					; Renton, Michael/A-9979-2011; Powles, Stephen/A-2558-2008; Scott, John/C-1061-2009; Walsh, Michael/B-3283-2011	Borger, Catherine/0000-0001-8541-3215; Renton, Michael/0000-0003-1316-0145; powles, stephen/0000-0001-6375-1977; Scott, John/0000-0002-8303-9706; Walsh, Michael/0000-0002-2748-9753													0043-1737	1365-3180				AUG	2009	49	4					400	408		10.1111/j.1365-3180.2009.00703.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2009.00703.x													WOS:000267742800009

McMaster Mesonet soil moisture dataset: description and spatio-temporal variability analysis	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												This paper introduces and describes the hourly, high-resolution soil moisture dataset continuously recorded by the McMaster Mesonet located in the Hamilton-Halton Watershed in Southern Ontario, Canada. The McMaster Mesonet consists of a network of time domain reflectometer (TDR) probes collecting hourly soil moisture data at six depths between 10 cm and 100 cm at nine locations per site, spread across four sites in the 1250 km(2) watershed. The sites for the soil moisture arrays are designed to further improve understanding of soil moisture dynamics in a seasonal climate and to capture soil moisture transitions in areas that have different topography, soil and land cover. The McMaster Mesonet soil moisture constitutes a unique database in Canada because of its high spatio-temporal resolution. In order to provide some insight into the dominant processes at the McMaster Mesonet sites, a spatio-temporal and temporal stability analysis were conducted to identify spatio-temporal patterns in the data and to suggest some physical interpretation of soil moisture variability. It was found that the seasonal climate of the Great Lakes Basin causes a transition in soil moisture patterns at seasonal timescales. During winter and early spring months, and at the meadow sites, soil moisture distribution is governed by topographic redistribution, whereas following efflorescence in the spring and summer, soil moisture spatial distribution at the forested site was also controlled by vegetation canopy. Analysis of short-term temporal stability revealed that the relative difference between sites was maintained unless there was significant rainfall (> 20 mm) or wet conditions a priori. Following a disturbance in the spatial soil moisture distribution due to wetting, the relative soil moisture pattern re-emerged in 18 to 24 h.

Daily flow records from seven hydrological stations and the range of variability approach were utilized to investigate the variability and spatial pattern of the hydrologic alterations induced by the construction of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, China. Results show that the impoundment of the TGD disturbed the hydrologic regime downstream and directly affected the streamflow variations. The rate of changes and the annual extreme conditions were more affected by the TGD, particularly the low-flow relevant parameters. The alterations in the hydrologic regime were mainly caused by the TGD storing water during early autumn and releasing water during winter and spring. The effects on spatial patterns decreased as the distance from the dam increased, which was mainly attributed to the inflows from large tributaries along the Yangtze River as well as the interaction with the two largest natural lakes (i.e., Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake). These hydrologic alterations not only break the natural balance of eco-flow regimes but also result in undesirable ecological effects, particularly in terms of habitat availability for the fish community.																				2073-4441				MAY	2014	6	5					1419	1434		10.3390/w6051419	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w6051419													WOS:000337113600016

IMPORTANCE OF ACIDIC PHOSPHATASE ACTIVITY IN P SUPPLY AND GONYOSTOMUM SEMEN EHRENBERGH (RAPHIDOPHYTA) OCCURRENCE IN A HUNGARIAN PEAT BOG, KELEMERI KIS-MOHOS (NE HUNGARY)	ACTA BIOLOGICA HUNGARICA												Phosphatase enzymes are capable of releasing phosphate through cleavage of phosphoester bonds. The seasonal importance of this process was examined by using a model substrate paranitrophenylphosphate and the Michaelis-Menten equation to estimate the release rate of PO(4)-P from phosphomonoesters. The seasonal occurrence of phosphomonoesters and acid phosphatase activity was used to estimate the velocity of phosphate release from these compounds. Filter fractionation of phosphatase activity demonstrated that most activity (>60%) was in size fractions less than 0.45 mu m. The release rates were highest in May and June (15 to 25 nmol L(-1) min(-1)) during the Gonyostomum semen (Raphidophyta) bloom and decreased to less than 2 nmol L(-1) min(-1) in two weeks and remained low throughout the summer and the fall. Fractionation of (32)P-H(3)PO(4) labelled dissolved organic phosphorus showed this fraction to vary considerably through the year. Potential phosphate release declined through the summer and into the fall. Significance of the co-occurrence of phosphomonoesters and acid phosphatase activity maxima and Gonyostomum semen ( Raphidophyta) bloom is discussed.					; Tóthmérész, Béla/A-5114-2009; Borojević, Koraljka/C-7713-2013; B-Beres, Viktoria/AAI-2055-2019; Benedek, Klara/AAA-2778-2022; Udovič, Marija/IZE-0991-2023; Nagy-László PhD, Zsolt/ABF-1526-2021; István, Grigorszky/Q-2245-2019	Tothmeresz, Bela/0000-0002-4766-7668; B-Beres, Viktoria/0000-0002-9632-2703; Gligora Udovic, Marija/0000-0002-1982-2528; 													0236-5383					MAR	2010	61	1					111	121		10.1556/ABiol.61.2010.1.11	http://dx.doi.org/10.1556/ABiol.61.2010.1.11								20194104					WOS:000275055000011

Earlier passage of males in the spring has been explained by sexual differences in winter latitude (male-biased sex ratios at more northerly areas) and onset of migration (males departing earlier). We investigated sex differences during spring migration by capturing and radio-marking Western Sandpipers at two Pacific coast sites, San Francisco Bay, California and Grays Harbor, Washington and at a Great Basin interior wetland, Honey Lake, California. We monitored northward migration of 132 radio-marked birds at a network of 12 major stopover sites and 4 breeding areas. At the banding sites, we observed differences in sex by date and site, with males preceding females. We found sex differences in departure time of radio-marked birds from the banding site, their arrival time at the Copper River Delta, Alaska (our most frequently used stopover site), and in the likelihood that a Stopover was used. Our data suggest that by mid to late April, migration timing becomes more compressed and sex differences are less pronounced and harder to detect.

J	George, DG; Hewitt, DP				George, DG; Hewitt, DP			The influence of year-to-year variations in winter weather on the dynamics of Daphnia and Eudiaptomus in Esthwaite Water, Cumbria	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												1. Micro-crustacea of the genus Daphnia and Eudiaptomus have evolved different physiological mechanisms for coping with lift: in a rapidly changing environment. In this paper, we analyse some of the physical and biological factors influencing the winter abundance of the two species in a small lake (Esthwaite Water in Cumbria). 2, The results demonstrate that much of the year-to-year variation in their relative abundance can be related to long-term changes in the weather. The highest numbers of Daphnia were typically found in cold, calm winters when small flagellates were relatively abundant. In contrast, the highest numbers of Eudiaptomus were found in mild, windy winters when the phytoplankton community was dominated by colonial diatoms. 3, Year-to-year variations in the winter abundance of Eudiaptomus had no effect on their subsequent development but the numbers of overwintering Daphnia had a significant effect on the size of their first spring 'cohort'. The most important factor influencing the overwintering performance of the two species was the water temperature. 4. Winter air temperatures over much of Europe are influenced by the atmospheric pressure variation known as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Winter water temperatures in Esthwaite Water were strongly correlated with this empirical index and there was a significant positive correlation between the NAO and the number of overwintering Eudiaptomus.																			0269-8463					JUN	1999	13			1			45	54		10.1046/j.1365-2435.1999.00007.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2435.1999.00007.x													WOS:000081662300007

During spring and summer, up to 96.6% of phosphates could be converted to organic P forms in the lake water, which was attributed to algal uptake. The large variations occurred in the trophogenic zone (0-4 m) and varied for mineral dissolved P 0.3-96.2%, for organic dissolved 1.5-81.4% and for organic particulate 0.7-79.5%, of the total P. In the winter, maximum concentrations of total P occurred in the sediments (2260 .mu.g P/g dry wt) and in the interstitial water (3490 .mu.g P/l). The content of organic P in the bottom sediments was higher (56.6-80.3%) than the content of total mineral P (19.7-43.4%). Organic P in the bottom sediments was bound into 2 main forms as phosphoproteins (85-91.2%) and as phospholipids (8.6-14.7%), and mineral P as Ca (51.9-63.6%) and Al compounds (9.3-14.5%). Although Fe content may be the dominant factor in the P sorptive and retentive capacity of sediments, the percentage of P bound with Fe in the investigated lake was extremely low.																			0003-9136						1979	86	2					217	241																WOS:A1979HK30300007

Analysis of changes in climate and river discharge with focus on seasonal runoff predictability in the Aksu River Basin	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The River Aksu is the principal tributary to the River Tarim, providing about three quarters of its discharge. It originates in Kyrgyzstan and flows into the arid areas of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in China, where an extensive irrigated agriculture has been developed in the river oases. The aim of the present contribution is to review the current trends in temperature, precipitation, and river discharge and links between these variables. The temperature in the region and the river discharge have been rising. Changes were studied using multiple trend analyses with different start and end years. Correlations between daily temperature and discharge are high and statistically significant for two headwater subcatchments of the Aksu for most of the time. However, there are episodes in late summer or beginning of autumn when correlations between temperature and discharge for the Xiehela station are absent. This can only be explained by Glacial Lake Outburst Floods from the Lake Merzbacher that are not routinely monitored. On an annual time scale, changes in summer discharge in the highly glacierized Xiehela subcatchment are dominated by changes in temperature. In contrast, in the subcatchment Shaliguilanke, variations in summer streamflow are more strongly influenced by variations in precipitation. A comparison of links between climatic variables and streamflow at different temporal scales is offered. Perspectives for seasonal forecasting are examined.					; Duethmann, Doris/A-1452-2014; Kundzewicz, Zbigniew/AFC-9334-2022; Vorogushyn, Sergiy/B-9743-2014; Krysanova, Valentina/AAR-2324-2020	Kundzewicz, Zbigniew/0000-0002-3579-5072; Duethmann, Doris/0000-0002-8463-9463; Vorogushyn, Sergiy/0000-0003-4639-7982; Wortmann, Michel/0000-0002-1879-7674; Merz, Bruno/0000-0002-5992-1440; Hartmann, Heike/0000-0003-1257-4661													1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2015	73	2			SI		501	516		10.1007/s12665-014-3137-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-014-3137-5													WOS:000347446400002

However, as the spatio-temporal pattern of this development and the underlying climatic mechanisms are yet not fully understood, new high-resolution paleoclimate records from this region are needed. Within this study, a sediment core from Lake Son Kol (Central Kyrgyzstan) was investigated using sedimentological, (bio) geochemical, isotopic, and palynological analyses, aiming at reconstructing regional climate development during the last 6000 years. Biogeochemical data, mainly reflecting summer moisture conditions, indicate predominantly wet conditions until 4950 cal. yr BP, succeeded by a pronounced dry interval between 4950 and 3900 cal. yr BP. In the following, a return to wet conditions and a subsequent moderate drying trend until present times are observed. This is consistent with other regional paleoclimate records and likely reflects the gradual Late Holocene diminishment of the amount of summer moisture provided by the mid-latitude Westerlies. However, climate impact of the Westerlies was apparently not only restricted to the summer season but also significant during winter as indicated by recurrent episodes of enhanced allochthonous input through snowmelt, occurring before 6000 cal. yr BP and at 5100-4350, 3450-2850, and 1900-1500 cal. yr BP. The distinct similar to 1500year periodicity of these episodes of increased winter precipitation in Central Kyrgyzstan resembles similar cyclicities observed in paleoclimate records around the North Atlantic, likely indicating a hemispheric-scale climatic teleconnection and an impact of North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) variability in Central Asia.					; Gleixner, Gerd/M-8519-2017; Witt, Roman/AAR-5231-2020	Witt, Roman/0000-0002-3934-0892; Schroder, Birgit/0000-0003-4807-6357; Schwarz, Anja/0000-0003-0722-2354; Schwalb, Antje/0000-0002-4628-1958; Lauterbach, Stefan/0000-0003-4131-0366; Schnetger, Bernhard/0000-0003-1638-3977; Gleixner, Gerd/0000-0002-4616-0953; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				AUG	2014	24	8					970	984		10.1177/0959683614534741	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683614534741													WOS:000340131800008

We investigated the seasonal dynamics of the microbial community in two small peat bog lakes, KuA(0)nik Olsowy and KuA(0)nik Bagienny, located in western Poland. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses revealed that the bacterial community was dominated by Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, in addition to a substantial number of archaea. An infrared epifluorescence analysis demonstrated that aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs (AAPs) constituted a significant fraction of bacterial plankton (1-19 %). All the bacterial groups exhibited large seasonal changes whose course differed between the studied lakes. While chlorophyll had its maximum during winter or early summer, AAPs peaked in summer, when the growth of this group was stimulated by higher irradiance and elevated water temperatures.					; Glinska-Lewczuk, Katarzyna/H-9759-2019; Koblizek, Michal/H-2851-2014; Medova, Hanulka/AAW-5285-2020; Lew, Marcin/O-4200-2014	Owsianny, Pawel Michal/0000-0003-0517-5881; GLINSKA-LEWCZUK, KATARZYNA/0000-0002-7845-6353; Koblizek, Michal/0000-0001-6938-2340													0015-5632	1874-9356				MAR	2015	60	2					165	175		10.1007/s12223-014-0352-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12223-014-0352-0								25331011					WOS:000349336800011

Strong seasonal variation was observed. In summer, the surface mixed layer in the middle of the lake was found to be generally undersaturated for CH3Cl but consistently supersaturated for CH3Br relative to air-water gas equilibrium; meanwhile, the deep waters (z(max) = 65 m) of the summertime lake were found to be depleted to near zero levels for both compounds. In winter, the methyl halides were observed to be vertically well mixed throughout the water column and strongly undersaturated in both species. A simple mass-balance box model indicates that the wintertime lake (T = 8 degreesC) is a net sink for atmospheric methyl halides with estimated loss rates of similar to2.6-3.2 pM d(-1) for CH3Cl (1 pM = 10(-12) mol L-1) and 0.09-0.13 pM d(-1) for CH3Br, probably because of unspecified microbiological processes. In summer, the mass balance model indicates that there is a net source of CH3Br in the surface mixed layer (0.17-0.25 pM d(-1)), as required to maintain the observed strong supersaturation. However, the summer surface waters are apparently a sink for CH3Cl, (1.9-2.9 pM d(-1)), with enhanced biological production compensated by larger combined microbial and chemical sinks terms. In summer, methyl halide concentrations in the deep waters continue to decrease exponentially at the observed wintertime rate, while both production and loss rates in the surface waters are likely much faster than in winter, resulting in much shorter turnover timescales. An order-of-magnitude extrapolation of these Lake Washington methyl halide fluxes to a global source/sink from freshwater lakes implies a negligible contribution (<0.05%) with respect to the currently estimated global budgets of these gases.																			0024-3590					NOV	2000	45	7					1537	1545		10.4319/lo.2000.45.7.1537	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2000.45.7.1537													WOS:000165267100008
J	DIANA, JS				DIANA, JS			GROWTH, MATURATION, AND PRODUCTION OF NORTHERN PIKE IN 3 MICHIGAN LAKES	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Differences in the age at 1st maturation, as well as timing and magnitude of growth (body and gonad) were examined for northern pike E. lucius from 3 lakes in Michigan. The lakes varied in latitude (42-46.degree. N), ice-free season (210-248 days), and total mortality (Z = 0.28-0.85). Body and gonad calorific equivalents were similar among all 3 lake populations. Male and female northern pike from all lakes and age classes 1-3 had significant accumulation of somatic energy during summer and winter and depletion of reserves over spawning. Testicular growth occurred entirely in the summer; ovarian growth occurred mainly over winter. Females invested 6- to 18-fold more energy into gonads than did males. Total winter growth was significant in both sexes and all lakes. Individual body and gonad growth over the first 3 years of life for northern pike varied little among lakes. Age at 1st maturation varied significantly among lakes; the earliest maturation occurred in the lake of intermediate latitude, the latest in the southernmost lake. These differences did not correspond well with length of the growth season. There appears to be a relationship between total mortality (due to differences in fishing intensity) and proportion of fish mature at age 1. Increased fishing intensity may have induced higher total mortality rates, earlier ages at 1st reproduction and higher total energy allocations to reproduction at earlier ages among these populations. Latitudinal differences in climate had little or no apparent effect on growth and reproductive characteristics of the populations.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1983	112	1					38	46		10.1577/1548-8659(1983)112<38:GMAPON>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1983)112<38:GMAPON>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1983QC25800004

Seasonal changes in diel activity of juvenile European catfish Silurus glanis (Linnaeus, 1758) in Bysicka Lake, Central Bohemia	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												Dualism in activity has been described in many fish species, including larger individuals of European catfish (Silurus glanis), which are able to switch their activities from nocturnal to diurnal in winter and spring. During the multi-year telemetry study, seasonal changes in diel activity of 45 juvenile European catfish were investigated. These juveniles exhibited no dualism in movement and were strictly nocturnal and crepuscular with no period of diurnal activity. During winter, the same juvenile European catfish were completely inactive throughout the 24-hr cycle. Also investigated was the impact of temperature, dissolved oxygen levels and water clarity on fish movement, relocation of resting places and home range size. The only significant correlations were that relocation and home range size increased with rising water temperatures.

However, evidence from the Slapton basin shows that this efficiency varies seasonally and is much less marked in the winter than in the summer, pointing to the need for basin management during winter flows. In addition, while wetlands may reduce nutrient and sediment concentrations, thus improving downstream water quality, the accumulation of nutrients and sediments in the wetland can lead to progressive eutrophication and, in addition, terrestrialization of valued wetland habitats, further reinforcing the need for basin source control.

Historical evidence, however, has shown that the timing of river-ice break-up has been shifting in many areas of the Northern Hemisphere and these shifts were associated with observed air temperatures during the break-up period. This paper reviews past trends in break-up from the Eurasian and North American circumpolar regions and synthesizes them into a regional and temporal context. It also evaluates various hydro-climatic explanations for these trends including associations with winter/spring air temperature variations and relationships to large-scale circulation patterns. Even more dramatic changes to break-up timing and magnitude are forecast to occur as the result of climate change. Insights toward future break-up conditions are discussed for two broad-scale regions: the North, a region forecast to experience the most pronounced warming, and the southern limit of the cold regions, a zone of particular cryospheric sensitivity to warming.																			0029-1277						2004	35	4-5					281	293																WOS:000226167100002

Seasonal Sources of Whole-Lake CH4 and CO2 Emissions From Interior Alaskan Thermokarst Lakes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The lakes that form via ice-rich permafrost thaw emit CH4 and CO2 to the atmosphere from previously frozen ancient permafrost sources. Despite this potential to positively feedback to climate change, lake carbon emission sources are not well understood on whole-lake scales, complicating upscaling. In this study, we used observations of radiocarbon (C-14) and stable carbon (C-13) isotopes in the summer and winter dissolved CH4 and CO2 pools, ebullition-CH4, and multiple independent mass balance approaches to characterize whole-lake emission sources and apportion annual emission pathways. Observations focused on five lakes with variable thermokarst in interior Alaska. The C-14 age of discrete ebullition-CH4 seeps ranged from 39515 to 28,240150 YBP across all study lakes; however, dissolved (CH4)-C-14 was younger than 4,730 YBP. In the primary study lake, Goldstream L., the integrated whole-lake C-14 age of ebullition-CH4, as determined by three different approaches, ranged from 3,290 to 6,740 YBP. A new dissolved-C-14-CH4-based approach to estimating ebullition C-14 age and flux showed close agreement to previous ice-bubble surveys and bubble-trap flux estimates. Differences in open water versus ice-covered dissolved gas concentrations and their C-14 and C-13 isotopes revealed the influence of winter ice trapping and forcing ebullition-CH4 into the underlying water column, where it comprised 50% of the total dissolved CH4 pool by the end of winter. Across the study lakes, we found a relationship between the whole-lake C-14 age of dissolved CH4 and CO2 and the extent of active thermokarst, representing a positive feedback system that is sensitive to climate warming. Plain Language Summary Lakes that form as a result of thawing permafrost (perennially frozen ground) can release new greenhouse gases from ancient carbon reservoirs, which further warm the atmosphere and promote more permafrost thaw. Existing observations of this phenomenon are insufficient to fully understand the impact that thaw lakes have on the current atmosphere, let alone the atmosphere of a future warmer world. In this study, we used a novel approach and made open water and ice-covered measurements of rare carbon isotopes in methane and carbon dioxide dissolved in lake water and in bubbles emitted from sediments to determine the whole-lake-scale environmental drivers that regulate gas emissions from thawing permafrost. We learned that despite highly variable carbon source ages within single lakes, the presence of winter-ice traps and mixes all lake sources proportionally into the dissolved gas pool during winter and allows the stronger greenhouse gas, methane, to be oxidized to carbon dioxide before emission to the atmosphere in spring. This study also confirmed that higher levels of permafrost thaw within a lake are related to older carbon sources fueling whole-lake gas emissions, which, if consistent with lakes across northern permafrost regions, is evidence of a potential positive feedback to further climate warming.

Distribution, abundance and production of Hemimysis anomala in Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Hemimysis anomala is one of the latest macroinvertebrates to invade the Laurentian Great Lakes. Since first reported in 2006, Hemimysis have been confirmed in several locations within the Great Lakes basin. However, little is known about the seasonal and spatial variation in demographics and dynamics of Hemimysis populations. We used a standardised pier-based methodology to describe the distribution of Hemimysis at 29 locations around the shoreline of Lake Ontario in 2009. Samples were collected in spring, summer, and fall at most locations, and bi-weekly at one site (Bronte Creek) over a 12-month period in 2009. For each site, we estimated abundance by sex and size. The more temporally intensive sampling at Bronte Creek enabled us to estimate production. Hemimysis were found at 83% of the sites visited, with densities generally highest in the northwest and lower at the other sites. Production estimates (2.67-14.09 mg dry weight.m(-2).d(-1)) were higher than that of other common zooplankton species in the Great Lakes. We provide important life history parameters that will help ecologists better understand the potential impacts of Hemimysis on Great Lakes ecosystems.

However, few studies have focused on the effects of nutrient reduction on 8-diversity and community structure, and long-time series analyses are particularly scarce. We conducted a 19-year case study on the impacts of management intervention on the temporal 8-diversity of aquatic grazers in a lake at the Yangtze River Basin. In our study, we compared the changes in temporal 8-diversity as well as its two components, nestedness and turnover, and the synchrony of the rotifer community after management intervention. Our results showed that while the abundance of some sensitive species increased, there was no trend in species richness. Moreover, both the seasonality and interannual stabilities of rotifer assemblages increased. The species synchrony decreased in both spring and summer after management intervention. We also found that management intervention significantly reduced nutrient concentrations but not water clarity and phytoplankton abundance. The total nitrogen (TN): total phosphorous (TP) ratio was reduced after management intervention, causing an increase in the abundance of cyanobacteria that may contribute to the increase of rotifer synchrony in autumn. Our results imply that stable environmental fluctuations after management intervention may increase temporal 8-diversity and stability of herbivorous assemblages. However, imbalanced changes in TN and TP after management intervention may weaken the top-down control of zooplankton on phytoplankton and slow down water clarity improvement.					; Su, Haojie/JVO-6993-2024	Li, Yun/0000-0003-3655-2475; Liu, Xia/0000-0002-6225-9179; Su, Haojie/0000-0003-4780-1094													0043-1354	1879-2448				JUN 1	2022	216								118364	10.1016/j.watres.2022.118364	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.118364		MAR 2022						35367940					WOS:000791916300001

In addition to two volcanic eruptions, increased snow cover played an important role. Annual-to-decadal variability in northern midlatitude temperature is dominated by the cold season. However, climate field reconstructions are often based on tree rings that represent the growing season. Here we present cold-season (October-to-May average) temperature field reconstructions for the northern midlatitudes, 1701-1905, based on extensive phenological data (freezing and thawing dates of rivers, plant observations). Northern midlatitude land temperatures exceeded the variability range of the 18th and 19th centuries by the 1940s, to which recent warming has added another 1.5 degrees C. A sequences of cold winters 1808/9-1815/6 can be explained by two volcanic eruptions and unusual atmospheric flow. Weak southwesterlies over Western Europe in early winter caused low Eurasian temperatures, which persisted into spring even though the flow pattern did not. Twentieth century data and model simulations confirm this persistence and point to increased snow cover as a cause, consistent with sparse information on Eurasian snow in the early 19th century.					; Brönnimann, Stefan/A-5737-2008; Franke, Joerg/N-7819-2013	Franke, Jorg/0000-0001-7897-4225; Samakinwa, Eric/0000-0003-1907-060X; Burgdorf, Angela-Maria/0000-0002-8971-4741; Bronnimann, Stefan/0000-0001-9502-7991; 														2041-1723				APR 19	2022	13	1							2116	10.1038/s41467-022-29677-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-29677-8								35440103					WOS:000784997300099

Fuji and Nitrate Loading in the Katsuragawa River	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY-CHIGAKU ZASSHI												Lake Sagami, which is fed by the Katsuragawa River, supplies about 60% of tap water in Kanagawa Prefecture. However, excess growth of phytoplankton due to high loading of nutrients such as nitrogen in summer has been an issue since the 1980s. Therefore, identifying nitrate loading in the Katsuragawa River watershed can be considered to be critical. The headstream of the river, at the northern foot of Mt. Fuji, is selected for a study of nitrate loading, in which oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen isotopes in water and nitrate are used to determine the sources of springs and nitrate contamination. Hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in water samples indicate that precipitation at the northern foot of Mt. Fuji and water from Lake Yamanakako are the main sources of springs in the Oshino area. Low nitrate concentrations with high nitrogen isotope values in spring water indicate low-level wastewater contamination in the springs. Furthermore, a watershed investigation identifies the characteristics of nitrate loading in the Katsuragawa River. The distribution of nitrate concentration and nitrogen isotope values indicates that springs and wastewater drainage from residential areas are significant sources contributing to the upstream nitrate load. However, nitrate concentrations and nitrogen isotope values downstream are reduced by the diluting effect of tributary water originating from mountain areas.

J	Tian, YR; Gao, YQ; Guo, D				Tian, Yurun; Gao, Yongqi; Guo, Dong			The Relationship between Melt Season Sea Ice over the Bering Sea and Summer Precipitation over Mid-Latitude East Asia	ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												Independent datasets consistently indicate a significant correlation between the sea ice variability in the Bering Sea during melt season and the summer rainfall variability in the Lake Baikal area and Northeastern China. In this study, four sea ice datasets (HadISST1, HadISST2.2, ERA-Interim and NOAA/NSIDC) and two global precipitation datasets (CRU V4.01 and GPCP V2.3) are used to investigate co-variations between melt season (March-April-May-June, MAMJ) Bering Sea ice cover (BSIC) and summer (June-July-August, JJA) East Asian precipitation. All datasets demonstrate a significant correlation between the MAMJ BSIC and the JJA rainfall in Lake Baikal-Northeastern China (Baikal-NEC). Based on the reanalysis datasets and the numerical sensitivity experiments performed in this study using Community Atmospheric Model version 5 (CAM5), a mechanism to understand how the MAMJ BSIC influences the JJA Baikal-NEC rainfall is suggested. More MAMJ BSIC triggers a wave train and causes a positive sea level pressure (SLP) anomaly over the North Atlantic during MAMJ. The high SLP anomaly, associated with an anti-cyclonic wind stress circulation anomaly, favors the appearance of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in a zonal dipole-pattern in the North Atlantic during summer. The dipole SST anomaly drives a zonally orientated wave train, which causes a high anomaly geopotential height at 500 hPa over the Sea of Japan. As a result, the mean East Asian trough moves westward and a low geopotential height anomaly occurs over Baikal-NEC. This prevailing regional low pressure anomaly together with enhanced moisture transport from the western North Pacific and convergence over Baikal-NEC, positively influences the increased rainfall in summer.

Links between acceleration, melting, and supraglacial lake drainage of the western Greenland Ice Sheet	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												The impact of increasing summer melt on the dynamics and stability of the Greenland Ice Sheet is not fully understood. Mounting evidence suggests seasonal evolution of subglacial drainage mitigates or counteracts the ability of surface runoff to increase basal sliding. Here, we compare subdaily ice velocity and uplift derived from nine Global Positioning System stations in the upper ablation zone in west Greenland to surface melt and supraglacial lake drainage during summer 2007. Starting around day 173, we observe speedups of 6-41% above spring velocity lasting similar to 40 days accompanied by sustained surface uplift at most stations, followed by a late summer slowdown. After initial speedup, we see a spatially uniform velocity response across the ablation zone and strong diurnal velocity variations during periods of melting. Most lake drainages were undetectable in the velocity record, and those that were detected only perturbed velocities for similar to 1 day, suggesting preexisting drainage systems could efficiently drain large volumes of water. The dynamic response to melt forcing appears to (1) be driven by changes in subglacial storage of water that is delivered in diurnal and episodic pulses, and (2) decrease over the course of the summer, presumably as the subglacial drainage system evolves to greater efficiency. The relationship between hydrology and ice dynamics observed is similar to that observed on mountain glaciers, suggesting that seasonally large water pressures under the ice sheet largely compensate for the greater ice thickness considered here. Thus, increases in summer melting may not guarantee faster seasonal ice flow.

We assessed the nutritional quality (crude protein [CP] contents) of staple foods, reproductive success, fawn recruitment, winter body mass, and body size in an introduced population of sika deer (Cervus nippon Temminck, 1938) on Nakanoshima Island, Lake Toya, Japan, which underwent repeated irruptions with shifting alternative foods and maintained high densities (>20 deer/km(2)). Our evaluation covered each irruptive dynamical phase, including initial irruption (Phase 1), second irruption (Phase 2), and subsequent phase (Phase 3). CP contents of staple foods (plum yew and litterfall in Phases 2 and 3, respectively) were at the same level as that of dwarf bamboo in Phase 1 during summer but were lower in autumn and winter, suggesting a decline in diet quality after initial irruption. The deer herd exhibited density-dependent changes in life-history traits, including delayed sexual maturity, lower fawn recruitment, and delayed body growth. The mean adult female (>= 3 years old) body mass in Phases 2-3 was marginally above the 50% pregnancy rate threshold. The deer herd tolerated substantial declines in food quality, which involved trade-offs between survival, growth, and reproduction as adaptations to life-history traits. This phenotypic plasticity is the main factor in maintaining high deer densities under severe food resource limitations. This suggests that the sika deer population will not reach equilibrium with their food resources without hunting or predators.					; Takafumi, Hino/ABA-1196-2021; Takeshita, Kazutaka/HPE-1411-2023	Ikeda, Takashi/0000-0003-3217-3275; 													1438-3896	1438-390X				JUL	2025	67	3					265	282		10.1002/1438-390X.12213	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1438-390X.12213		MAY 2025											WOS:001490801600001
J	Nicholls, KH				Nicholls, KH			Effects of temperature and other factors on summer phosphorus in the inner Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario: implications for climate warming	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Summer total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in the inner Bay of Quinte (northeastern Lake Ontario), averaging about five times higher than winter concentrations, were strongly influenced by positive reflux of sediment TP. Several factors potentially influencing the magnitude of the summer peak (1 July to 30 September mean), including seasonal point-source and non-point-source TP loading, seasonal flushing rates, and water temperature, were explored in a multiple regression analysis. Three variables contributed significantly to explanation of the variance in the overall regression (adjusted R-2 = 0.876): June to September water temperature, total daily TP loading rate from three local point-sources (sewage treatment plants) and flow-weighted averaged July to September TP concentrations in the lower Trent and Moira rivers. The strong influence of temperature on summer TP concentrations in the inner Bay of Quinte (where water and air temperatures are nearly I:I) has important implications for climate change. Summer average water temperature increases of 3 to 4 degrees C are within the range of those predicted by several general circulation models (GCMs with 2x CO2 end points). The multiple regression model suggests that summer TP concentrations could about double with a water temperature rise of 3 to 4 degrees C above the 1990 to 1994 mean. This would effectively "undo" many benefits achieved to date in point-source TP loading control.																			0380-1330						1999	25	2					250	262		10.1016/S0380-1330(99)70734-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(99)70734-3													WOS:000081807600003

Intermittently Closed and Open Lakes and/or Lagoons (ICOLLs) as groundwater-dominated coastal systems: Evidence from seasonal radon observations	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Intermittently Closed and Open Lakes or Lagoons (ICOLLs) are dynamic coastal systems that may be vulnerable to changes in catchment hydrology. However, little is known regarding the role of groundwater on the hydrological cycles of ICOLLs. Groundwater discharge in two ICOLLs (Welsby and Mermaid) and a nearby wetland (South Welsby Lagoon) located on Bribie Island (Australia) was quantified using radon (Rn-222, a natural geochemical groundwater tracer) during four seasonal surveys. The distribution of radon revealed temporal and spatial changes over the study period with higher surface water radon concentrations found in winter for Welsby ICOLL and in autumn for Mermaid ICOLL. The average estimated groundwater discharge rates from a radon mass balance were 3.4 +/- 2.1, 7.3 +/- 8.9 and 2.6 +/- 1.1 cm d(-1) in Welsby, South Welsby and Mermaid Lagoons, respectively. These values are at least 8-fold greater than the average annual precipitation that falls directly over the ICOLLs (1420 mm per year, or 0.4 cm d(-1)), which, coupled with minimal surface water runoff due to the permeable sandy soils, demonstrates that these systems are groundwater-dominated. Overall, groundwater discharge rates in these ICOLLs were much larger than has been reported in other lake systems which is most likely due to the high permeability of regional sandy soils and their large shoreline to volume ratio.

J	Conti, ALR; Guerrero, JM; Regueira, JM				Conti, ALR; Guerrero, JM; Regueira, JM			Levels of microcystins in two Argentinean reservoirs used for water supply and recreation: Differences in the implementation of safe levels	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY					6th International Conference on Toxic Cyanobacteria	JUN 21-27, 2004	Bergen, NORWAY					Toxic cyanobacterial blooms are an increasing problem in Argentina. The production of cyanobacterial hepatotoxins (microcystins) and their presence in drinking and recreational waters represent a growing danger to human and animal health. Risk management deals with the probability that a certain exposure to toxins will lead to specific health outcomes. Various model schemes for risk management have been portrayed, most of which have some common elements. These include the need for an information base on which to make decisions. Thus, seasonal variability in the concentrations of total microcystins and cyanobacterial cells was studied in two reservoirs: San Roque and Paso de las Piedras. Both reservoirs are eutrophic water bodies and mainly used to supply drinking water and for recreation. Because San Roque is an important recreational spot, the spatial distribution of microcystins was also investigated. Sampling of the San Roque Reservoir occurred from 1998 to 2000 and of the Paso de las Piedras Reservoir from June to December 2002 (late autumn, winter, and spring). Microcystins were identified by LC-MS, and their concentrations were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These hepatotoxic compounds were detected in all seasons, and even during winter relatively high concentrations were observed. Concentrations in the San Roque Reservoir varied from undetectable to 920 mu g/L. On the contrary, in the Paso de las Piedras Reservoir the concentration remained below 1 mu g/L, which is the provisional guideline value proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO; Chorus and Bartram, 1999) for microcystin-LR in drinking water. Comparison of cell number and concentration of total microcystins indicated that the phytoplankton in San Roque Reservoir contained more toxic cyanobacterial strains than did the Paso de las Piedras Reservoir. This indicates that the threshold of 2000 cell/mL proposed by WHO as a alert level should be adjusted: it should be reduced for the San Roque Reservoir, whereas it seems appropriate for the Paso de la Piedras Reservoir.

This dietary knowledge allows the quantitative assessment of the role of key species in energy and contaminant transfer, their impact on prey communities, and their susceptibility to perturbation. The diet of Mysis relicta was examined in Lake Ontario in spring, summer, and autumn using both techniques. Mysids fed on the bottom during the day and in the pelagia and on the bottom at night. A trophic fractionation of 2.2 parts per thousand N between mysids and their prey provided the best correspondence between the observed stable isotope signature of mysids and that estimated from their diet. Tissue turnover rate of delta C-13 was slow compared with that of delta N-15. Diatoms formed 50% of the assimilated diet in May. In September, 25% of large mysids feeding on the bottom contained amphipod parts and 20% contained phytoplankton. The remainder of the diet consisted of zooplankton and rotifers. The contribution of amphipods and phytoplankton could not be quantified. Revised daily consumption estimates, based on this new diet information and clearance rate estimates of consumption, gave daily consumption estimates similar to those estimated from previous bioenergetic modelling.					; Servos, Mark/A-3454-2015	Rudstam, Lars/0000-0002-3732-6368; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				OCT	2001	58	10					1975	1986		10.1139/cjfas-58-10-1975	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-58-10-1975													WOS:000171520100008

Ultrastructurally, the two forms exhibited variations in outline of the cross section, cell wall, chloroplasts, thylakoidal membrane arrangements, and abundance of starch and lipid bodies. The summer form which predominated over other submerged filamentous algae in creeks and riverbeds and along lake shorelines was found to be more tolerant of the algicide, showing only apical cell damage al a concentration of 0.5 mg/L after 4 days. In contrast, the fall form prevailing in late November was completely destroyed at this concentration. The impact of the possible existence of more than one genetic form of C. glomerata in the Great Lakes is discussed in view of this species' frequent use in biomonitoring and bioaccumulation studies.																			0380-1330						1993	19	2					333	341		10.1016/S0380-1330(93)71221-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(93)71221-6													WOS:A1993LN30700013

Ecological and Morphological Characteristics and Feeding of Perch (Perca fluviatilis) in the Autumn-Winter Period in Dystrophic and Oligotrophic Lakes of Northern Karelia (Russia)	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												The biological features (length-weight parameters, age structure) and diet composition of populations of river perch Percafluviatilis L., 1758 in small lakes of northern Karelia (dystrophic Krugloe Lake and oligotrophic Krivoe Lake) in the autumn-winter period have been studied. Significant differences in growth rates, as well as in a number of morphological parameters (eye diameter, length of the head, postorbital section, head height at the occiput, maximum and minimum body height, antedorsal and anteventral distances, and the length of the caudal peduncle and mandible), are found between the perch populations of the studied lakes. In perch from Krugloe Lake, which is distinguished by high color and low transparency of water, the size of the eye in proportions of the body and head is noticeably larger compared to fish from the "light-water " Krivoe Lake. According to the type of feeding, the perch of both lakes is a euryphage with a high proportion of benthic invertebrates (81-83% according to the index of relative importance) and a low proportion of fish in the diet (< 1% in Krugloe Lake and 5.6% (20% with an AD length > 22 cm) in Krivoe Lake). In the winter period, the diet of perch from both lakes was dominated (> 50%) by larvae of large mayflies Ephemeravulgata. Planktonic and benthic crustaceans were subdominants (> 10%) in the diet of perch from Krivoe, while in Krugloe Lake these were caddisfly larvae and chironomid larvae. The weight growth rate of perch in an oligotrophic lake is more than 2 times higher than in fish from a dystrophic reservoir, however; in general, it is significantly lower than in larger lakes in Karelia (including Syamozero, Onega, and Ladoga). This, apparently, is due to the low level of piscivorous perch in the conditions of northern low productivity lakes.					; Berezina, Nadezhda/R-1968-2016; Terentjev, Petr/K-3164-2018	Berezina, Nadezhda/0000-0003-3057-5596; Terentjev, Petr/0000-0002-6810-1823; 													1995-0829	1995-0837				DEC	2022	15	6			SI		915	928		10.1134/S1995082922060177	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1995082922060177													WOS:000900128400019

Molecular and microscopic diversity of planktonic eukaryotes in the oligotrophic Lake Stechlin (Germany)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The aim of this study was to compare a molecular and a microscopic approach to study the planktonic eukaryotic diversity of an oligotrophic lake. Plankton samples from the temperate Lake Stechlin were assessed in winter and summer 2008 by comparison of 18S rRNA gene clone libraries to light microscopic evaluations. For both approaches identical samples were used. There were remarkable differences between the main groups recovered by the contrasting methods. The microscopic analyses showed predominance of autotrophic planktonic organisms, whereas most of them could not be discovered by the molecular method which resulted in a higher diversity of heterotrophic flagellates. The microscopic survey revealed high diversity of Chlorophyta and Cryptophyta as well as the Stramenopiles groups of Bacillariophyceae and Chrysophyceae. The clone libraries, based on full-length 18S rRNA gene sequences, displayed highest diversity of Alveolata belonging to seven different subclades. Notably, Antarctic Dinophyta-related clones were detected. The occurrence of the marine phagotrophic flagellate Telonema was also documented. Comparing the two sampling seasons, rich diversity suggests that flagellates played an important role in late winter (February), however, there is relatively low diversity in summer (August). The newly discovered molecular diversity of planktonic eukaryotes in Stechlin will help to understand the biodiversity patterns in freshwater lakes.

Comparative spatial ecology of sympatric adult muskellunge and northern pike during a one-year period in an urban reach of the Rideau River, Canada	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												The reach of the Rideau River that flows through Ottawa, Ontario supports a recreational fishery for northern pike (Esox lucius) and muskellunge (Esox masquinongy). The reach is unique not only because such a vibrant esocid-based recreational fishery exists in an urban center, but that these two species co-occur. Typically, when these species occur sympatrically, northern pike tend to exclude muskellunge. To ensure the persistence of these esocid populations and the fisheries they support it is important to identify key spawning, nursery, foraging and over-wintering locations along this reach, and to evaluate the extent to which adults of the two species exhibit spatio-temporal overlap in habitat use. Radio-telemetry was used to track adult northern pike (N = 18; length 510 to 890 mm) and adult muskellunge (N = 15; length 695 to 1200 mm) on 73 occasions over one year, with particular focus on the breeding seasons (early April until the end of May [56 % tracking effort]). For the two esocids, we observed 19-60 % overlap in key aggregation areas during each season and during the spawning period. The minimum activity (average linear river distance travelled between consecutive tracking events) and core range (linear river distance within 95 % C.I. of mean river position) were greatest in the winter and fall for northern pike and in the spring for muskellunge. On average, northern pike were considerably smaller than muskellunge and had lower minimum activities and smaller core ranges, which could be a result of thermal biology, limited suitable habitat, prey availability or predation. Results from this study will inform future management of these unique esocid populations and should be considered before any habitat alterations occurs within or adjacent to the Rideau River.					; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010	Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; 													0378-1909	1573-5133				APR	2016	99	4					409	421		10.1007/s10641-016-0482-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-016-0482-0													WOS:000374670500007

This model was applied to the Lake Michigan population with information on water content, gonad weight, energy density, diet, and thermal history. Water content (inversely correlated with energy density) of nonspawning Lake Michigan bloaters decreased linearly with increasing weight for fish smaller than 155 g. Model results indicated comparatively small seasonal changes in consumption, a result of high consumption by bloaters at low temperatures and relatively small differences in the temperatures of occupied water between winter and summer. Growth rates and food conversion efficiencies of bloater estimated from the model were higher by factors of 2-4 than comparable values for the alewife Alosa pseudoharengus, indicating that Lake Michigan could support a higher biomass of native coregonines than of the introduced alewife. Bioenergetics estimates of annual consumption of Diporeia hoyi and Mysis relicta by both bloaters and alewives more than doubled between 1973-1975, when alewife dominated, and 1987, when bloater dominated. This increase was most evident in the winter, when bloater feeding rates were relatively high, and during summer, when alewives fed primarily on zooplankton.

Seasonality in cold coast bluff erosion processes	GEOMORPHOLOGY												High water levels in the Laurentian Great Lakes are causing widespread erosion of unlithified coastal bluffs and damaging infrastructure. Measurements of bluff recession along Wisconsin's Lake Michigan coast are mostly limited to estimates generated from comparisons of historical orthophotos with little information about the shortterm scales (months to years) that affect many management and hazard-based decisions. Here we investigate the physical factors driving coastal bluff response to toe erosion at seasonal timescales using a multi-method case study of a mixed lithology bluff in Southeastern Wisconsin, an area that undergoes annual freezing. Five drone photogrammetry surveys were conducted from the winter of 2018 through the winter of 2020, and time lapse photography was collected from March 2019 through February 2020. The bluff face volumetric erosion rate between December 2018 and June 2019 was 3800 m(3) a(-1), which is 300% larger than the erosion rate between June 2019 and November 2019. Statistical analysis of the time lapse photography indicates that high magnitude erosion events are significantly correlated with environmental factors, including freeze-thaw events. These observations suggest that bluff erosion occurs episodically and is dominated by freeze-thaw related mass wasting events during the winter and spring. To investigate the physical processes driving this pattern, we model transient pore pressure response to a frozen bluff face as an input to a 3-D moment-balance slope stability model. Results show that increases in pore pressures up to one meter are possible at the face of the bluff over 5 days, which corresponds to 4-7% reduction in slope stability, indicating that observed increases in upslope bluff erosion during the winter and spring are a result of increased pore pressures, in combination with sediment strength reduction and high vadose zone saturation. As elevated lake levels continue to steepen bluff toes, up slope impacts will likely be temporally clustered during times of freeze-thaw. To accurately predict the seasonality of bluff recession on cold coasts, landscape change models must incorporate transient conditions caused by freeze-thaw events as they appear to be a dominant process.

When the euphotic zone extended below the epilimnion, PP > 250 .mu.m was concentrated deep in the euphotic zone. PP > 250 .mu.m was a significant but variable portion of the total P (TP) pool in individual lakes; thus, samples should be collected from the euphotic zone on several dates to estimate the contribution of PP > 250 .mu.m to the TP pool. As well, the contribution of this fraction varied among lakes: average summer values for the euphotic zone ranged from 3-19%. Among lakes, the contribution of large particles to the TP pool decreased proportionally as lake productivity (estimated by chlorophyll a (Chl a)) increased. The relative contribution of PP > 250 .mu.m in summer accounted for a significant portion of the residual variation in the spring TP-summer Chl a relationship but not the summer TP-summer Chl a relationship in the study lakes. These apparently contradictory results can be explained by differences between lakes that mixed intermittently throughout the summer and those that remained permanently thermally stratified during this time.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1984	41	2					351	363		10.1139/f84-038	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f84-038													WOS:A1984SP98000012

The spatio-temporal heterogeneity of river environment can greatly affect the methane oxidation process. However, currently, few studies have focused on the spatio-temporal changes in activity of methane oxidation and the associated microbiome in riverine ecosystems, which hinders a comprehensive understanding the role of this process in reducing emissions of CH4. Here, we investigated the variations in methane oxidation activity and community of methanotrophs in sediment of a mountain river across different reaches and seasons. The potential methane oxidation rate ranged from 24.11 to 493.03 nmol CH4 g- 1 (sediment) d-1, which was significantly greater in sediment obtained during the winter than in that obtained during the summer. Moreover, the rate in middle reaches was significantly greater than that in upper and lower reaches in summer. The abundance of pmoA gene of methanotrophs ranged from 2.45 x 106 to 2.98 x 107 copies g- 1 (sediment), which was also significantly greater in winter than in summer and showed significant variations among reaches. Additionally, methanotrophic diversity and community composition exhibited significant variations across both reaches and seasons, and the relative abundance of Methylococcus and Methylocystis was closely associated with methane oxidation activity. Sediment NH4+ content, pH and temperature were potentially crucial factors affecting the activity or methanotrophic community. In conclusion, it is necessary to consider both temporal and spatial scales to improve our understanding of the significance and driving mechanisms of methane oxidation in controlling CH4 emissions from rivers.

Despite its average depth of 1 m and oligohaline waters, excessive turbidity, fish grazing, and toxic compounds have inhibited submerged macrophyte growth. In spring 2018, a significant area of Myriophyllum spicatum emerged and exhibited significant density until its complete disappearance in August 2018. Using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 imagery, we monitored water quality variables and vegetation density during these months. Our study revealed the first unique occurrence of M. spicatum in more than 40 years. A period of increased transparency from summer 2017 compared to previous years seems to be the cause of this appearance, while high summer temperatures caused its disappearance. While improving water quality may help restore submerged macrophyte meadows, our results suggest that summer maximum temperatures may inhibit recovery. Remote sensing, particularly the NDVI index, proved successful in monitoring aquatic vegetation and understanding species-environment relationships. This methodology can enhance future monitoring efforts for macrophyte colonization and expand knowledge of their occurrence and causes of disappearance in this and other similar areas.

J	Berglund, O; Larsson, P; Ewald, G; Okla, L				Berglund, O; Larsson, P; Ewald, G; Okla, L			Influence of trophic status on PCB distribution in lake sediments and biota	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												We investigated the relationship between trophic status and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) distribution in 19 Swedish lakes. We analyzed PCB in water, phytoplankton, zooplankton, fish and sediment during two sampling periods, in spring and summer. The mass of Sigma PCB in the lake sediments was positively related to lake trophy, i.e. more PCBs were accumulated and buried in the sediment of eutrophic lakes than in oligotrophic lakes. In the oligotrophic lakes a greater fraction of the total PCB load was dissolved in water. We conclude that this is a result of higher sedimentation rates in eutrophic lakes and relatively lower turnover of organic carbon in the water column of the shallow, eutrophic lakes. In the stratified lakes, the amount of PCB per cubic meter in the epilimnion decreased from spring to summer. We suggest that sedimentation of plankton beneath the thermocline during stratification act as a sink process of PCBs from the epilimnion. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Results showed that the total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) loads from upstream discharge were the major external loads in the lake, accounting for 70% and 63% of the total loads, respectively. Scenario simulation results indicated that 93.2% of the lake area in summer (August) and 89.5% in autumn (November) could reach the protective targets (TN < 1.0 mg/L) under 50% reduction of inflow TN loads. Meanwhile, 58.7% of the lake area in summer and 63.1% in autumn could reach the protective targets (TP < 0.05 mg/L) under 50% reduction of aquaculture areas. The mass budget results of TN and TP showed that TP immobilisation was larger than TN immobilisation. The immobilisations for TN and TP from July to September were higher than those of other months under the combined impacts of increasing runoff during the wet period, phytoplankton bloom and water residence time. The 2D water quality model provided a relevant example for assessing the effects of runoff and aquaculture activities and served as scientific support for lake management to improve water quality in large shallow macrophytic lakes.

J	Nutz, A; Schuster, M				Nutz, Alexis; Schuster, Mathieu			Stepwise drying of Lake Turkana at the end of the African Humid Period: a forced regression modulated by solar activity variations?	SOLID EARTH												Although the timing of the termination of the African Humid Period (AHP) is now relatively well established, the modes and controlling factors of this drying are still debated. Here, through a geomorphological approach, we characterize the regression of Lake Turkana at the end of the AHP. We show that lake level fall during this period was not continuous but rather stepwise and consisted of five episodes of rapid lake level fall separated by episodes marked by slower rates of lake level fall. Whereas the overall regressive trend reflects a decrease in regional precipitations linked to the gradual reduction in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation, itself controlled by orbital precession, we focus discussion on the origin of the five periods of accelerated lake level fall. We propose that these periods are due to temporary reductions in rainfall across the Lake Turkana area associated with repeated westward displacement of the Congo Air Boundary (CAB) during solar activity minima.

Regional climate model simulations for Europe at 6 and 0.2 k BP: sensitivity to changes in anthropogenic deforestation	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												This study aims to evaluate the direct effects of anthropogenic deforestation on simulated climate at two contrasting periods in the Holocene, similar to 6 and similar to 0.2 k BP in Europe. We apply We apply the Rossby Centre regional climate model RCA3, a regional climate model with 50 km spatial resolution, for both time periods, considering three alternative descriptions of the past vegetation: (i) potential natural vegetation (V) simulated by the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS, (ii) potential vegetation with anthropogenic land use (deforestation) from the HYDE3.1 (History Database of the Global Environment) scenario (V + H3.1), and (iii) potential vegetation with anthropogenic land use from the KK10 scenario (V + KK10). The climate model results show that the simulated effects of deforestation depend on both local/regional climate and vegetation characteristics. At similar to 6 k BP the extent of simulated deforestation in Europe is generally small, but there are areas where deforestation is large enough to produce significant differences in summer temperatures of 0.5-1 degrees C. At similar to 0.2 k BP, extensive deforestation, particularly according to the KK10 model, leads to significant temperature differences in large parts of Europe in both winter and summer. In winter, deforestation leads to lower temperatures because of the differences in albedo between forested and unforested areas, particularly in the snow-covered regions. In summer, deforestation leads to higher temperatures in central and eastern Europe because evapotranspiration from unforested areas is lower than from forests. Summer evaporation is already limited in the southernmost parts of Europe under potential vegetation conditions and, therefore, cannot become much lower. Accordingly, the albedo effect dominates in southern Europe also in summer, which implies that deforestation causes a decrease in temperatures. Differences in summer temperature due to deforestation range from -1 degrees C in south-western Europe to +1 degrees C in eastern Europe. The choice of anthropogenic land-cover scenario has a significant influence on the simulated climate, but uncertainties in palaeoclimate proxy data for the two time periods do not allow for a definitive discrimination among climate model results.

J	Chen, SF; Wu, RG; Chen, W; Hu, KM; Yu, B				Chen, Shangfeng; Wu, Renguang; Chen, Wen; Hu, Kaiming; Yu, Bin			Structure and dynamics of a springtime atmospheric wave train over the North Atlantic and Eurasia	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												The leading pattern of boreal spring 250-hPa meridional wind anomalies over the North Atlantic and mid-high latitude Eurasia displays an obvious wave train. The present study documents the structure, energy source, relation to the North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST), and impacts on Eurasian climate of this wave train during 1948-2018. This atmospheric wave train has a barotropic vertical structure with five major centers of action lying over subtropics and mid-latitudes of the North Atlantic, northern Europe, central Eurasia, and East Asia, respectively. This spring wave train can efficiently extract available potential energy from the basic mean flow. The baroclinic energy conversion process and positive interaction between synoptic-scale eddies and the mean flow both play important roles in generating and maintaining this wave train. The North Atlantic horseshoe-like (NAH) SST anomaly contributes to the persistence of the wave train via a positive air-sea interaction. Specifically, the NAH SST anomaly induces a Rossby wave-type atmospheric response, which in turn maintains the NAH SST anomaly pattern via modulating surface heat fluxes. This spring atmospheric wave train has significant impacts on Eurasian surface air temperature (SAT) and rainfall. During the positive phase of the wave train, pronounced SAT warming appears over central Eurasia and cooling occurs over west Europe and eastern Eurasia. In addition, above-normal rainfall appears over most parts of Europe and around the Lake Baikal, accompanied by below-normal rainfall to east of the Caspian Sea and over central Asia.

J	Boës, X; Fagel, N				Boes, Xavier; Fagel, Nathalie			Relationships between southern Chilean varved lake sediments, precipitation and ENSO for the last 600 years	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												In this paper, the relationships between paleo-precipitation and the regional influence of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in South America are assessed from a high-resolution calendar varve-thickness record. Two short laminated sediment cores (53 and 61 cm length) from Lago Puyehue (40 degrees S) are analysed by continuous varve measurements through the last 600 years. The calendar varve years are determined by the occurrence of graded planktonic-rich layers. The annual sediment accumulation rates are reconstructed by using the standard varve-counting methods on thin sections. The 1980-2000 varve-thickness record is interpreted in terms of climate through correlation with limnological and local monthly instrumental climate databases. The comparison between the standardized varve thickness with the instrumental records reveals a strong correlation (r = 0.75, p = 0.07) between the total varve thickness and the austral autumn/winter precipitation. We argue that strong austral winter winds and precipitation are the forcing factors for the seasonal turn-over and phytoplankton increase in the lake sediments. During strong El Nino events the precipitation and the winds decrease abnormally, hence reducing the thickness of the biogenic sediments deposited after the winter turn-over. Our results show one significant regional maximum peak of winter precipitation (>900 mm) in the mid 20th century and a significant period with lower winter precipitation (<400 mm) before the 15th century, i.e., the late Medieval Warm Period. The first peak in the mid 20th century is confirmed by the regional precipitation database. The influence of ENSO cycles over the last 600 years is assessed by spectral analysis in Fagel et al. (2007). The possible influence of the regional volcanism and/or the seismic activity on the local climate record is also discussed.						fagel, nathalie/0000-0002-8231-8295													0921-2728	1573-0417				FEB	2008	39	2					237	252		10.1007/s10933-007-9119-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-007-9119-9													WOS:000252419600006

As northern pike represents the top of the food web in many northern temperate lakes and may structure the ecosystem both directly and indirectly, a detailed understanding of the behaviour of this species during winter is important. We continuously monitored the activity of adult northern pike (Esox lucius) in a small temperate lake from late summer to winter for two consecutive years using an automatic acoustic positional telemetry system. Four subsample periods representing different temperature regimes from each year were chosen for further investigation. The results revealed that pike activity was similar between seasons. In all periods, a distinct diel pattern, showing increased activity during day as compared to night, was evident. Our findings indicate that the fish component of temperate lentic ecosystems can be more active during the cold season than previously assumed. This may have implications for the structuring effect of pike on the lower trophic levels.					; Koed, Anders/ABH-1055-2020; Baktoft, Henrik/E-6581-2011; Boel, Mikkel/GQQ-4445-2022; Svendsen, Jon Christian/J-2716-2013; Skov, Christian/X-6511-2019; Aarestrup, Kim/AAK-9155-2021; Svendsen, Jon/J-2716-2013; Jepsen, Niels/D-4225-2009; Berg, Søren/AAJ-8104-2021	Skov, Christian/0000-0002-8547-6520; Koed, Anders/0000-0002-2163-0955; Jepsen, Niels/0000-0003-0927-6823; Berg, Soren/0000-0001-8772-0921; Baktoft, Henrik/0000-0002-3644-4960; Svendsen, Jon Christian/0000-0002-0273-0985; Aarestrup, Kim/0000-0001-8521-6270; 													0906-6691	1600-0633				JUL	2012	21	3					386	394		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2012.00558.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2012.00558.x													WOS:000304818800007

The aim of this study was to monitor and determine the causes of road mortality of two amphibian species (Bufo bufo and Bufo verrucosissimus) belonging to the same genus identified during the fieldwork conducted in April and June 2021. In total, 213 roadkill individuals have been detected in independent surveys. While 89.20% of these individuals were B. bufo, 10.80% of belonged to B. verrucosissimus. In general, amphibian road mortality is intense in the spring season. Moreover, the frequency of these mortalities can last until late summer. Our study supported the general pattern, and most of observations were recorded during spring (April-May) as well as summer period (June-July). The highest number of roadkill mortality was observed in Ikizdere town of Rize province for B. bufo, and Murgul town of Artvin province for B. verrucosissimus. These areas with the highest number of deaths were determined as hotspots based on the heatmap shaped by kernel density calculation. Therefore, mitigation measures should be taken by local authorities to reduce mortality rate in these hotspots.					; gül, serkan/ABC-4333-2020; Özdemir, Nurhayat/AAJ-7595-2021; Dursun, Cantekin/AAN-4654-2021; Ozdemir, Nurhayat/AAJ-7595-2021	Dursun, Cantekin/0000-0001-7766-1470; gul, serkan/0000-0002-0372-7462; Ozdemir, Nurhayat/0000-0002-3880-5846													1062-3590	1608-3059				DEC	2023	50	SUPPL 4		4			S746	S755		10.1134/S1062359023601623	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1062359023601623													WOS:001172984100015

Role of groundwater exchange on the energy budget and seasonal stratification of a shallow temperate lake	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												An 18-month time series of the temperature and biogeochemical properties of a shallow, hyper-eutrophic lake was conducted in East Anglia, UK. The data show a seasonal stratification cycle that is typical of mid-latitude monomictic lakes with an overturning interval during the coldest part of winter. The existing paradigm suggests that this is due to the seasonal variation of the surface heat fluxes. However, sediment temperatures indicate that there may be significant bottom heating in winter and bottom cooling in summer. The temperature difference between the lowermost part of the lake water column and the underlying sediments shows a change of sign at approximately the start and end of summer stratification. An energy budget of the lake - calculated using vertical temperature profiles and atmospheric meteorological parameters - suggests that there may be a significant input of ground water below the thermo-cline of the lake. The groundwater heat flux term is calculated to be the second most important cooling factor after longwave radiation in the overall heat budget during the summer. The groundwater effect is more important than latent heat flux cooling for this lake, and this has important implications for the 'heat-budget method' that has been used to quantify evaporation from lakes. A time-resolved analysis suggests that there is little seasonal variation in the calculated groundwater flux and no clear correspondence with rainfall variations. Groundwater input to lakes may be more important than previously believed and may be an important factor of the overturning dynamics of some lakes.

The withdrawal level was also regulated to keep the downstream epilimnion away from the nutrient supply. This method markedly reduced algal blooming in the reservoir downstream of the curtains during spring and summer. The physical and biological processes in the reservoir ecosystem were analysed using the 2-D reservoir model DYRESM and chemical and biological submodels, to predict the water quality and algal species composition in the reservoir. The horizontal variability was maintained in the model by dividing the horizontal layer into parcels. Temperature, chlorophyll-a, soluble phosphorus, nitrate, ammonium, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, internal nitrogen, internal phosphorus were considered as state variables in the model. The simulated results revealed the mechanism of how algal blooming is reduced, during early spring high algal concentrations consume large amounts of nutrients, which reduces the nutrient supply to the downstream zone of the reservoir, whereas during late spring and summer, nutrient dispersion from the upstream epilimnion to the downstream epilimnion is curtailed by the curtains, markedly reducing algal blooming in the downstream zone.

Here we investigated the statistical relations between precipitation, temperature, and impervious surface fraction in 12 major cities across the contiguous United States. The results showed negative correlations between snowfall intensity and impervious surface fraction. The correlations depend on latitude and the distance to complex terrain features (water bodies or topography), with stronger correlations for inland cities than coastal/lakeside cities. We further selected Kansas City for modeling analyses based on the Weather Research and Forecasting model. Simulation results indicated that the heating effect of urban land occurs in the nearsurface atmosphere during the precipitation period, leading to changes of different hydrometers and an overall tendency of reducing snowfall but increasing rainfall.

Assessment of heavy metal and PAH exposure in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) in the Reedy River watershed, South Carolina, USA: A multi-season assessment of metallothionein and bile fluorescence	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Biomarkers can be used as tools to help determine ecological exposure in watershed assessments. In the present study, metallothionein and fixed wavelength bile fluorescence for two-, four-, and five-ring hydrocarbons were used as biomarkers of exposure in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) in the Reedy River watershed located in South Carolina, USA. Fish were sampled from three impoundments and a reference site over three seasons in the same year. Biomarker endpoints were compared to chemical concentrations at each site during each season. Results indicated that despite elevated concentrations of hydrocarbons being present in sediments, the hydrocarbons did not appear to be bioavailable based on bile fluorescence analysis. Bile fluorescence analysis also indicated that the hydrocarbons detected in this watershed were likely of petrogenic origin. Significantly elevated sediment concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni, Ag, Zn, and metallothionein were found in one impoundment, Lake Conestee, compared with the reference site, indicating both the presence and bioavailability of these metals. Seasonal variability of bile fluorescence was limited; however, metallothionein showed elevated concentrations in the spring and summer compared with fall. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2012; 31: 27632770.

In this study, the atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) was investigated in Lake Kasumigaura, Japan's second-largest lake, for approximately seven years. Seasonal variations in the total N (TN) and total P (TP) fluxes tended to be higher in spring and lower from fall to winter. The annual variations could be categorized into three distinct periods in conjunction with the precipitation trend. The estimated annual fluxes based on these three periods showed that the TN flux was accurately predicted. A comparison of the results of this study with those of studies conducted around 1980 reveals that the concentration of dissolved inorganic N in wet deposition has declined. This suggests that decreased N oxide (NOX) concentrations due to air pollution control measures contribute to the decrease in the nitrate (NO3-N) flux in atmospheric deposition. Despite the reduction in N fluxes from atmospheric deposition, monthly calculations of the impact of atmospheric deposition on Lake Kasumigaura revealed that the total inflow load reached a maximum of 17% for TN and 26% for TP.

Diel, seasonal and man-induced changes in copepod assemblages and diversity, with special emphasis on hyperbenthic calanoid species, in a Mediterranean meromictic system (Lake Faro)	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The present study focuses on variations in day and night copepod community structure in a meromictic Mediterranean ecosystem (Lake Faro). Because of the high salinity in the lake, this environment is defined as a coastal-marine rather than true-lagoon ecosystem. Copepod abundances showed wide oscillations, with marked spatial and seasonal heterogeneity. The copepod assemblage was dominated by coastal and estuarine species Paracartia latisetosa and Acartia margalefi, in late summer-autumn and spring, respectively. A remarkable change in species composition was the occurrence of the alien species Oithona brevicornis, never having been reported in this environment before. O. brevicornis is progressively replacing the congener species O. nana. The discovery of the hyperbenthic calanoid species 'ecological group' contributes to increased functional diversity of this ecosystem, despite their relatively low abundances. All six hyperbenthic calanoid species occurred in the plankton community only at night, with spatial distribution patterns being related to substrate more than water physico-chemical parameters. Among all hyperbenthic calanoid species, Pseudocyclops xiphophorus was the only one able to inhabit the whole lake because of its daytime habitat (fouling material, attached to submerged ropes and mooring posts, widely distributed all around the lake). In this habitat, the temporal abundance pattern resembled the night-time one in plankton community.					; Brugnano, Cinzia/AAE-5354-2019	ZAGAMI, Giacomo/0000-0001-5083-8846; 													1323-1650	1448-6059					2013	64	10					951	964		10.1071/MF12344	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF12344													WOS:000324923800005
J	AGEE, EM				AGEE, EM			A DIAGNOSIS OF 20TH-CENTURY TEMPERATURE RECORDS AT WEST-LAFAYETTE, INDIANA	CLIMATIC CHANGE												A diagnostic study of 80 yr (1901-80) of surface temperatures collected at West Lafayette, Indiana, is in tune with the global trend and that for the eastern 2/3 of the USA, namely, cold at the turn of the century, warming up to about 1940, and then cooling to present. The study was divided into 2 cold periods (1901-1918, 1947-1980) and a warm period (1919-1946), based on the distribution of annual mean temperature. Decadal mean annual temperatures ranged from 10.degree. C in period I to 12.2.degree. C in period II, to 9.4.degree. C during the present cold period. The mean annual temperature for the 80 yr ranged from the coldest of 8.7.degree. C in 1979 to the warmest of 13.6.degree. C in 1939. The daily mean temperature for the entire 80-yr ranged from -4.7.degree. C on Jan. 31 to 25.1.degree. C on July 27. The coldest daily mean was -26.7.degree. C on Jan. 17, 1977, and the warmest daily mean was 35.degree. C on July 14, 1936. The range of values for the daily mean maximum temperatures was -.2.degree. C on Jan. 31 to 31.4.degree. C on July 27. Corresponding values for the daily mean minimum are -9.2.degree. C on Jan. 31 and 18.7.degree. C on July 27. The all-time extreme temperatures are -30.6.degree. C on Feb. 26, 1963 and 43.9.degree. C on July 14, 1936. Climatic variability was considered by computing the standard deviations of the daily mean maximum and minimum temperature per year, and the daily mean maximum and minimum temperatures for each day of the year for the 80-yr period. The daily mean maximum per year varies more than the daily mean minimum, for each year of the 80-yr period. The variability for both extremes was greater in each of the 2 cold periods than in the warm period. Particularly noticeable is the increase in the variability of the daily mean minima per year during the current cooling trend. The variability in the daily mean maxima and minima for each day of the year (based on the entire 80 yr) is 2 times greater in the winter than in the summer for both extremes, and about the same for each in the summer, greater for daily maximum in the spring and fall, but greater for the daily minimum during the winter. The latter result is undoubtedly related to the effect of snow cover on daily minimum temperatures. An examination of daily record maximum and minimum temperatures was made to help establish climatic trends in this century. For the warm period, 175 record maxima and 68 record minima were set, compared to 213 record minima and 105 record maxima during the recent cold period. For West Lafayette, the present climatic trend is definitely one of extreme record-breaking cold. Evidence is also presented to show the substantial increases in snowfall amounts in the lee regions of the Great Lakes during the present cold period, due to the lake-induced snow squall associated with cold air mass intrusions. The possible impact of the cooling trend on agricultural activities has also been noted, due to a reduced growing season.																			0165-0009	1573-1480					1982	4	4					399	418		10.1007/BF02423471	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02423471													WOS:A1982PU82000006
J	Syväranta, J; Hämäläinen, H; Jones, RI				Syvaranta, Jari; Hamalainen, Heikki; Jones, Roger I. .			Within-lake variability in carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. We assessed spatial and temporal variation in carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures in different compartments of a single lake ecosystem. Stable isotope analyses were made on samples of particulate organic matter (POM), zooplankton, periphyton, macrophytes, macroinvertebrates and fish collected from several locations throughout the ice-free period. 2. No spatial variation in delta C-13 or delta N-15 values was found for pelagic samples of POM and zooplankton. However, pelagic delta N-15 signatures increased steadily through the summer resulting in an almost 6 parts per thousand average increase in POM and zooplankton. A concurrent decrease in epilimnetic nitrate concentrations suggested that the increase in delta N-15 of POM and zooplankton could have resulted from a progressive N-15-enrichment of the available inorganic nitrogen pool as the size of this pool was reduced. 3. Significant spatial variation in isotopic ratios was observed within littoral and profundal communities. Some spatial differences were likely related to lake-specific characteristics, such as a major inlet and a small harbour area and some were interconnected with temporal events. 4. Marked differences between spring and autumn delta N-15 and delta C-13 values of fish at one site probably reflected a spring spawning immigration from a larger downstream lake and also indicated limited dispersal of these immigrants. 5. Our results indicate that restricted sampling of ecosystem components from lakes may provide misleading single values for the isotope end members needed for quantitative uses of stable isotopes in mixing models and for estimating trophic position. Hence we strongly advise that studies of individual lakes, or multiple lake comparisons, that utilise stable isotope analyses should pay more attention to potential within lake spatial and temporal variability of isotope ratios.

Millennial to orbital-scale variations of drought intensity in the Eastern Mediterranean	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Millennial to orbital-scale rainfall changes in the Mediterranean region and corresponding variations in vegetation patterns were the result of large-scale atmospheric reorganizations. In spite of recent efforts to reconstruct this variability using a range of proxy archives, the underlying physical mechanisms have remained elusive. Through the analysis of a new high-resolution sedimentary section from Lake Van (Turkey) along with climate modeling experiments, we identify massive droughts in the Eastern Mediterranean for the past four glacial cycles, which have a pervasive link with known intervals of enhanced North Atlantic glacial iceberg calving, weaker Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and Dansgaard-Oeschger cold conditions. On orbital timescales, the topographic effect of large Northern Hemisphere ice sheets and periods with minimum insolation seasonality further exacerbated drought intensities by suppressing both summer and winter precipitation.

The summer season predictions produce a cold bias in maximum daily temperature and a warm bias in minimum temperature that together lead to a good prediction of daily mean temperature but a smaller-than-observed diurnal temperature cycle. In winter, the predicted near-surface temperatures are lower both day and night, yielding good agreement with the observed amplitude of the diurnal temperature cycle but relatively large cold bias in daily mean temperature. The predicted temperatures in the boundary layer are also systematically lower than the observed temperatures in the two seasons. The cold bias is consistent with the wetter-than-observed lower atmosphere in the model prediction, which in turn can be attributed to an inadequate specification of soil moisture. In both seasons, the model produced substantially more precipitation in all categories, especially in the heavy precipitation category, and the overprediction is primarily associated with more widespread area coverage in the model prediction. The chances of producing a false precipitation forecast are substantially higher than missing an observed precipitation event. Small systematic errors are found in the predictions of low-level winds, but above the boundary layer, the predicted winds are predominantly from the west, while the observed winds are from the west-northwest. The model is able to capture the general development and evolution of the lake-land breezes in areas surrounding Lake Michigan during summer, although errors exist in the strengths of the breezes and the timing of their transition. Predicted early morning inversions are slightly stronger than observed in winter and weaker than observed in summer. The weak summer morning inversion results in a rapid inversion breakup followed by an earlier growth of a mixed layer after sunrise. Despite the head start, the predicted mixed-layer heights in late afternoon are lower than those observed, suggesting that either the predicted surface sensible heat flux may be too low or the boundary layer flux divergence may be too high. Decreasing horizontal grid spacing from 12 to 4 km results in little improvement in the predictions of near-surface and boundary layer properties except for precipitation, for which the model bias is significantly reduced by the increase in horizontal resolution. The cold and wet biases and errors in inversion strengths and mixed-layer development call for extra caution when using products from mesoscale forecasts in applications such as air pollution and fire weather prediction.																			0882-8156	1520-0434				FEB	2005	20	1					63	81		10.1175/WAF-834.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/WAF-834.1													WOS:000227175100006
J	Chiba, A				Chiba, Akira			Wintering behavior of a Siberian Crane Grus leucogeranus in Niigata, Japan, with special regard to food, foraging and vocal habits	ORNITHOLOGICAL SCIENCE												An immature Siberian Crane Grus leucogeranus straggled to Niigata, Japan, in late autumn 2016 and remained over winter in an area of rice fields. In this paper the bird's diet and foraging behavior during winter 2016/2017 are described. During daytime, the crane foraged alone, mostly on post-harvest rice fields where it fed almost exclusively on Water Chestnut Eleocharis kuroguwai tubers. Other foods, such as rice grains, earthworms, grasshoppers and fishes, though eaten were negligible in the bird's diet. The density of water chestnut tubers in the foraging area was estimated to be 3.1 +/- 3.0/m2 and the biomass 2.0 +/- 2.1 g/m2. The crane's foraging behavior generally included removing any superficial covering material, digging into and removing the soil, exploring the food in the beak and then consuming it with or without rinsing it in groundwater. During foraging, the frequency of food intake varied from 4.8 +/- 2.0/10 min to 41.3 +/- 9.5/10 min. These results indicate the great significance of water chestnuts in the diet of the Siberian Crane in winter, although further study is necessary for generalization.

Plant parts and corresponding water and sediment samples were taken at the inflow and outflow points of the four ponds at the beginning and at the end of the growing season. Concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni and Zn in the different compartments were estimated and their removal efficiency assessed, reaching more than 90% for Fe, Mn and Ni in spring and fall as well in the water compartment. The above- and below-ground cattail biomass varied from 0.21 to 0.85, and 0.34 to 1.24 kg dry weight/m(2), respectively, the highest values being recorded in the fourth pond in spring 2011. The root system was the first site of accumulation before the rhizome, stem and leaves. The highest metal concentration was observed in roots from cattails growing at the inflow of the system's first pond. The trend in the average trace element concentrations in the cattail plant organs can generally be expressed as: Fe > Mn > As > Zn > Cr > Cu > Ni > Cd for both spring and fall. While T. latifolia removes trace elements efficiently from landfill leachates, attention should also be paid to the negative effects of these elements on plant growth.

J	SIEGFRIED, CA; KOPACHE, ME				SIEGFRIED, CA; KOPACHE, ME			ZOOPLANKTON DYNAMICS IN A HIGH MOUNTAIN RESERVOIR OF SOUTHERN-CALIFORNIA	CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME												The dynamics of the zooplankton community of eutrophic Big Bear Lake was studied from Dec. 1976-Nov. 1978. The zooplankton community was dominated by the rotifer Keratella cochlearis in the spring; the copepod Diaptomus franciscanus in early summer; and by the cladocerans Daphnia pulicaria and Ceriodaphnia quadrangula for the remainder of the year. Annual abundance was bimodal with peaks in the spring and summer. The east end of Big Bear Lake had higher water temperatures, higher hypolimnetic dissolved O2 concentrations, and greater phytoplankton standing crops than the west end of the lake. As a result, it supported significantly higher standing crops of zooplankton. Zooplankton abundance was significantly higher in 1978, a normal precipitation year, than in 1977, a drought year. Littoral rotifers, cladocerans and copepods were commonly collected with the zooplankton, reflecting the shallow, weedy conditions of Big Bear Lake. Predator-prey and competitive interactions work to structure the zooplankton commmunity composition while phytoplankton productivity and water quality conditions interact with these processes to determine population levels.																			0008-1078	2331-0405					1984	70	1					18	38																WOS:A1984SB19700003

The plant serves about 100 persons. The first dam in the constructed wetland is S-formed, about 3 m deep with a combined anaerobic and aerobic treatment. The second stage is a vegetated (Carex sp), rather shallow dam (0,4 m) and the third dam is about 2 m. deep and equipped with a few islets. In the third dam, waterfowls are breeding each summer. Around the constructed wetland, trees has been planted and in the wetland the hardy species crucian carp (Carassius carassius) has been introduced in summer 1994 in order to extend the food-web. The constructed wetland is not yet fully established. Consequently, especially in winter, the microbial community and the plants are not able to take up mineralized nutrients. However, in summer, the constructed wetland meets the requirements. This experiment is during the summer of 1995 being extended with an surface flow system. The effluent is meandering through a small wooded (Salix sp.) area in which the nutrients are to be absorbed. The constructed wetland plant at Mansasen, Are municipality, Jamtland county, Sweden is an experiment in which a wetland system is combined with a terrestrial system.

J	Holliday, VJ; Warburton, J; Higgitt, DL				Holliday, V. J.; Warburton, J.; Higgitt, D. L.			Historic and contemporary sediment transfer in an upland Pennine catchment, UK	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												A sediment budget for an upland catchment-raservoir system tit Burnhope Reservoir, North Pennines, UK has been developed. This provides a framework for quantifying historic and contemporary sediment yields and drainage basin response to disturbance from climate change and human activities in the recent past. Bathymetrie survey, core sampling, Cs-137 dating and aerial photographs have been used to assess sediment accumulation in the reservoir. The average reservoir sedimentation rate is 1.24 cm yr(-1) (annual sediment yield 33.3 t km(-2) yr(-1) +/- 10%, trap efficiency 92%). Mean annual reservoir sedimentation over the 67 year period has been estimated at 592 +/- 10%. Inputs of suspended sediment from direct catchwater streams account for 54% of sediment supply to the budget (best estimate yield of 318 t yr(-1) +/- 129%), while those from actively eroding reservoir shorelines contribute 328 t yr(-1) +/- 92%. Sediment yield estimates from stream monitoring and reservoir sedimentation are an order of magnitude lower than those reported from South Pennine reservoirs of comparable drainage basin area. Analysis of historical rainfall series for the catchment shows fluctuations in winter and summer rainfall patterns over the past 62 years. From 1976 to 1998 there has been a diverging trend between winter and summer rainfall, with a large increase in winter and a gradual decrease in summer totals. Periods of maximum variation occur during the summer drought events of the late 1970s, early 1980s and mid-1990s. Analysis of the particle size of core sediments highlights abrupt increases in sand-sized particles in the top 20 cm or the core. Based on the Cs-137 chronology, these layers were deposited front the late 1970s onwards and relate to these diverging rainfall records and rapidly fluctuating reservoir levels. This provides evidence of potential sediment reworking within the reservoir by rapid water-level rise after drought.

J	HERZIG, A				HERZIG, A			PREDATOR-PREY RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE PELAGIC COMMUNITY OF NEUSIEDLERSEE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Neusiedler See, a shallow alkaline lake, has become increasingly eutrophic; this enrichment improved the nutritive situation of the herbivorous zooplankton leading to a higher standing stock. A multiple regression analysis of the long-term development of the crustacean plankton indicates that abiotic factors (i.e. wind, temperature) have the most important impact on the community in spring and autumn, biotic factors (i.e. food, predation) during the summer months. Currently an invertebrate (Leptodora kindti) and two planktivorous fish (Pelecus cultratus and Alburnus alburnus) control the population development of Diaphanosoma mongolianum during summer. L. kindti predation acts on immature stages, whereas the fishes consume adult stages. L. kindti densities of 100 to 200 ind. x m-3 affect the prey population to a negligible extent; densities between 300 and 500 ind. x m-3 result in elimination rates of 5 % to > 40 % of the juvenile Diaphanosoma stock. The impacts by the invertebrate predator are pronounced but short-term events. Juvenile and underyearling fish eliminate 4-13% of the zooplankton in the open lake and 5-33% inshore; their predation pressure acts on all younger stages of the crustaceans. Planktivorous fish older than 0 + concentrate on the large food items (adult stages of the crustaceans). A. alburnus is able to consume 6-16% of the zooplankton standing stock during summer. P. cultratus eliminates about 1-49% of D. mongolianum, 1-4% of A. spinosus and 1-31% of L. kindti. From May until August the position of the dominant predator changes, beginning with juvenile fish which are then followed by P. cultratus and then by A. alburnus. Predation by L. kindti is of importance in July and August; at that time it causes suppression of the juveniles of D. mongolianum, but, on the other hand, the older stages of L. kindti are endangered themselves by the predatory impact of planktivorous fish.																			0018-8158					FEB 25	1994	275						81	96		10.1007/BF00026702	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00026702													WOS:A1994NB19800009
J	Lindenschmidt, KE; Chorus, I				Lindenschmidt, KE; Chorus, I			The effect of aeration on stratification and phytoplankton populations in Lake Tegel, Berlin	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The Lake number is used as an indicator for the degree of stability and mixing in Lake Tegel, Berlin. It is shown that aeration during late spring and summer reduces the stability of the water column but does not overturn the lake as long as the stability due to meteorological forcing is strong enough. The increased mixing due to aeration during summer affected species composition by favoring population growth of some cyanobacterial species - Microcystis spp. and Aphanizomenon flos-aquae in competition against dinoflagellates - Ceratium spp. Further, it enabled growth of some large centric diatoms - Aulacoseira spp. - already during summer. Asterionella formosa, Planktothrix agardhii and Anabaena spp. grew better under more stably stratified conditions. The Lake number proved to be a useful tool for assessing the impact of stability and mixing upon phytoplankton population growth.

Larval, juvenile and adult fish communities were dominated by Atherinidae (mainly inland silverside, Menidia beryllina) and Moronidae (mainly juvenile striped bass, Morone saxatilis) and were consistently structured along a gradient of site exposure to prevailing winds and waves. Larval, juvenile and adult communities along this gradient varied from atherinids and moronids at highly exposed sites to mostly centrarchids (primarily Lepomis and Micropterus spp.) at protected sites. Secondarily, zooplankton densities, water clarity, and land-use characteristics were related to fish community structure. Rank correlation analyses and Mantel tests indicated that the spatial consistency and predictability of fish communities was high as larval fishes sampled during spring were concordant with juvenile and adult fishes sampled at the same sites during summer and fall in terms of abundance, richness, and community structure. We propose that the high predictability and spatial consistency of littoral-zone fishes in Lake Texoma was a function of relatively simple communities (dominated by 1-2 species) that were structured by factors, such as site exposure to winds and waves, that varied little through time.

One of these basins is Salar de Llamara (850 m a.s.l.), where large domed structures of seemingly evaporitic origin forming domes can be found. In this work, we performed a detailed microbial characterization of these domes. Mineralogical studies revealed gypsum (CaSO4) as a major component. Microbial communities associated to these structures were analysed by 454 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing and compared between winter and summer seasons. Bacteroidetes Proteobacteria and Planctomycetes remained as the main phylogenetic groups, an increased diversity was found in winter. Comparison of the upper air-exposed part and the lower water-submerged part of the domes in both seasons showed little variation in the upper zone, showing a predominance of Chromatiales (Gammaproteobacteria), Rhodospirillales (Alphaproteobacteria), and Sphingobacteriales (Bacteroidetes). However, the submerged part showed marked differences between seasons, being dominated by Proteobacteria (Alpha and Gamma) and Verrucomicrobia in summer, but with more diverse phyla found in winter. Even though not abundant by sequence, Cyanobacteria were visually identified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which also revealed the presence of diatoms. Photosynthetic pigments were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography, being more diverse on the upper photosynthetic layer. Finally, the system was compared with other endoevaporite, mats microbialite and Stromatolites microbial ecosystems, showing higher similitude with evaporitic ecosystems from Atacama and Guerrero Negro. This environment is of special interest for extremophile studies because microbial life develops associated to minerals in the driest desert all over the world. Nevertheless, it is endangered by mining activity associated to copper and lithium extraction; thus, its environmental protection preservation is strongly encouraged.

Plankton biomass partitioning in a eutrophic subtropical lake: comparison with results from temperate lake ecosystems	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Plankton were sampled for 6 years in a subtropical eutrophic lake in FL, USA, and absolute and relative carbon biomass was determined for bacteria, phytoplankton, heterotrophic and phototrophic nanoflagellates, ciliates, rotifers and crustacean zooplankton. We compared the results with findings from a comprehensive study of carbon biomass partitioning in eutrophic German lakes with elucidate common patterns and differences. Similarities between the temperate and subtropical systems included: similar seasonal dynamics, with maximal carbon biomass of nanoflagellates and metazoan zooplankton in spring and phytoplankton in summer to autumn, yearly averaged carbon occurring mainly in the phytoplankton and phytoplankton accounting for a much greater proportion of carbon than bacteria. There also were differences: the Florida lake had lower absolute and relative carbon biomass in crustacean zooplankton, stronger dominance of protozoa in total grazer carbon biomass, a lower ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton carbon and almost a monoculture of predation-resistant copepods (versus a relatively balanced distribution of carbon among cladocerans, copepods and rotifers in the temperate lakes). The subtropical lake also had 4-fold higher relative biomass of small filamentous cyanobacteria in its phytoplankton, which we attribute to light limitation. Although the Florida and German studies did not measure biomass of planktivorous fish, the differences observed here are consistent with a recent hypothesis that fish predation exerts stronger top-down control on the pelagic food web in subtropical lakes than in temperate lakes of similar trophic status.					east, t/KVY-8260-2024														0142-7873	1464-3774				DEC	2007	29	12					1087	1097		10.1093/plankt/fbm083	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbm083													WOS:000251211100008

Models are first evaluated by comparing annual cycles of precipitation, runoff, evaporation and net basin supply (NBS) with observations. Trends in mean values are then studied for each variable using Theil-Sen's statistical test. Changes in extreme conditions are analyzed using generalized extreme values distributions for a reference period (1971-2000) and two future periods (2041-2070 and 2071-2100). Ensemble trend results show evaporation increases of 136 and 204 mm (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) over the Great Lakes between 1953 and 2100. Precipitation increases by 83 and 140 mm and runoff increases by 68 and 135 mm. Trends are not equally distributed throughout the year as seasonal changes differ greatly. As a result, Great Lakes net basin supply is expected to increase in winter and spring and decrease in summer. Over the entire year, NBS increases of 14 and 70 mm are projected for scenarios RCP4.5 and 8.5 respectively by the year 2100. An analysis of extreme values reveals that precipitation and NBS maxima increase by 11 to 27% and 1 to 9% respectively, while NBS minima decrease by 18 to 29% between 1971-2000 and 2041-2100.

A total of 79.2% of the lakes experienced declining LLTDs during 2000-2022. What is the implication of the main finding? Atmospheric boundary layer stability contributes to the lake thermal effect. Land responds more rapidly to climate than lakes.Abstract Understanding the regulatory effects of lakes on land surface temperature is critical for assessing regional climatological and ecological dynamics on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). This study investigates the spatiotemporal variability in the thermal effect of lakes across the TP from 2000 to 2022 using the MODIS land surface temperature product and a model-based lake surface water temperature product. Our results show that the lake-land temperature difference (LLTD) within 10 km buffer zones surrounding lakes ranges from -2.8 degrees C to 3.4 degrees C. A declining trend in 79.2% of the lakes is detected during 2000-2022, with summer contributing most significantly to this decrease at a rate of -0.56 degrees C per decade. Assessments of the spatial extent of lake thermal effects show that the "warm island" effect in autumn (5.5 km) influences a larger area compared to the "cold island" effect in summer (1.3 km). Furthermore, southwestern lakes exhibit stronger warming intensities, while northwestern lakes show more pronounced cooling intensities. Correlation analyses indicate that lake thermal effects are significantly related to lake depth, freeze-up start date, and salinity. These findings highlight the importance of lake thermal regulation in heat balance changes and provide a foundation for further research into its climatic and ecological implications on the Tibetan Plateau.																				2072-4292				SEP 27	2025	17	19							3314	10.3390/rs17193314	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs17193314													WOS:001593918700001

J	Andersen, DO				Andersen, DO			Impacts of warm winters and extreme rainstorms on the base consumption in a limed lake, southern Norway	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The chemical composition of a limed take, the two main inlets and the outlet was monitored during a period of 3 years. The winters of 1991-1992 and 1992-1993 were unusually warm while the winter of 1993-1994 was more normal. The lake surface water was wind exposed in the warm winters and as a consequence of frequent turnovers the acid input from the catchment mixed with the whole lake water body. In the winter of 1993-1994, the lake was ice-covered for approximately 4 months. During this period the drainage water from the catchment flowed to the outlet of the lake in the upper 2-3 m of the water column and only some of the acid input was neutralised. This is compared to a complete neutralisation in the winter of 1992-1993. The in-lake loss of alkalinity during this warm winter was approximately 29 mueq/l (November-June) compared to approximately 7 mueq/l lakewater in 1993-1994. Acid drainage from the catchment induced by an extraordinary rainstorm with heavy sea-salt deposition contributed to the in-lake alkalinity consumption in spring 1993. As winter temperatures above 0degreesC and more frequent rainstorms may be common due to expected global warming, future increased lime consumption in-lakes may be projected in acidified areas as southern Norway.

J	Cho, HJ; Poirrier, MA				Cho, HJ; Poirrier, MA			Seasonal growth and reproduction of Ruppia maritima L. s.l. in Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana, USA	AQUATIC BOTANY												Ruppia maritima L. s.1. is an important submerged aquatic plant in Lake Pontchartrain, a water quality impaired oligohaline estuary located north of New Orleans, Louisiana, USA. Efforts to restore Lake Pontchartrain are in progress, and a major restoration goal is the re-establishment of historic submerged macrophyte beds that have declined since first studied in 1953. This study was part of a long-term monitoring program to distinguish natural from anthropogenic causes of macrophyte population changes. Ruppia populations were monitored monthly for a 2-year period to obtain information on seasonal growth, peak biomass periods, flowering, seed production, and germination. We found that Lake Pontchartrain R. maritima had relatively high peak biomass and two seasonal peaks of biomass and flowering due to high water temperature and absence of competition from other macrophytes. However, biomass peaks were often disrupted by storms. Shoot biomass was high from May through November, and low from December through April. Spring shoot growth from seeds, roots, and rhizomes was rapid. Plants matured and produced abundant inflorescences and seeds between May and October. Reproductive shoots bearing seeds were detached in May and June. Remaining shoots formed dense beds through vegetative propagation during the summer. Turion production occurred during the winter.

Seasonal Dynamics of Growth and Production of Monoporeia affinis (Amphipoda: Pontoporeiidae) in a Subarctic Lake: The Role of Temperature and Trophic Conditions	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												The growth and production of glacial relic amphipods Monoporeia affinis in a small subarctic lake were studied based on detailed seasonal observations in 2019-2021. Growth and production were closely related to trophic conditions (chlorophyll a concentration). The maximum values were observed at low water temperatures (similar to 5(degrees)C) in early summer, coinciding with the spring maximum of chlorophyll. The summer warming of bottom waters was accompanied by a decrease in the growth rate of amphipods, which is apparently associated with the consumption of most of the primary production in the pelagic zone. It is concluded that current climatic conditions can adversely affect glacial relicts even in cold-water lakes of the subarctic zone.

J	Bergtold, M; Traunspurger, W				Bergtold, M; Traunspurger, W			The benthic community in the profundal of Lake Brunnsee: seasonal and spatial patterns	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The seasonal distribution of bacteria, flagellates, ciliates, and selected metazoan organisms was investigated in the profundal sediment (18 m depth) of oligotrophic Lake Brunnsee (Germany) over a period of one year (April 1997 to April 1998). Most of the organisms displayed seasonal fluctuation with high abundance in summer and lower spring and autumn densities. Bacteria reached densities up to 2.1 x 10(10) cells/ml, with highest production values in July. Flagellates and ciliates had densities up to 151000 and 4100 cells/ml, respectively. Metazoan organisms were dominated by nematodes with a relative proportion of 76.4%, followed by rotifers with 6.5%. Other benthic taxa contributed less than 5% to overall abundance. Biotic and abiotic variables were tested for their ability to explain the variance in abundance of benthic organisms by means of multiple regression analyses. Vertical distribution of the metazoan organisms was recorded to a sediment depth of 4 cm. Most organisms preferred the uppermost centimetre. Rotifers and gastrotrichs have rarely been found (<15%) below 1 cm depth, while copepods and mites penetrate deeper (more than 60% have been found between 1 and 4 cm sediment depth). Spatial variation in abundance was recorded at a single sampling occasion by taking 16 sediment cores from the profundal of the lake. The spatial variation (differences between the cores) was highest for ciliates and bacteria and low for organic carbon, bacterial production, and bacterial extracellular activity.

J	Douglas, ME; Marsh, PC				Douglas, ME; Marsh, PC			Population estimates population movements of Gila cypha, an endangered cyprinid fish in the Grand Canyon region of Arizona	COPEIA												Gila cypha (the humpback chub) is a unique but endangered cyprind fish endemic to the Colorado River system in western North America. Its distribution within the system is patchy; occurrence is restricted primarily to narrow, canyon-bound reaches of these rivers. Greatest abundance is achieved at the confluence of the Colorado and Little Colorado rivers (= LCR) in northern Grand Canyon (Coconino County, AZ). This study defines the nature and extent of G. cypha's movements within the LCR, and tests the hypothesis that its duration of stay within that river is restricted to the reproductive period. During 1991-1992, adult G. cypha were captured and tagged during 19 6-14 day sampling periods in three separate reaches of the LCR. From these data, population estimates were derived for each reach on a monthly basis, by month for the entire LCR, and over the entire study period. Results indicate an upriver migration by some individuals in early spring, followed by a slow, protracted postreproductive movement downstream. Localized stasis by adults in the LCR, particularly summer through winter, is also strongly supported by the data. Movements by G. cypha in the LCR thus appears to be an amalgam of two processes: upriver movement in spring coupled with localized movements by overwintering adults. The latter suggests a possible alteration in life-history strategy for the species and is discussed in the context of Glen Canyon Dam, built in 1963 to impound Lake Powell at the northern extent of Grand Canyon.					; Douglas, Michael/T-1761-2019	Douglas, Michael/0000-0001-9670-7825; 													0045-8511	1938-5110				FEB 2	1996		1					15	28																WOS:A1996TU87000003

Seasonal formation and stability of dissolved metal particles in mining-impacted, lacustrine sediments	JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY												Formation of dissolved metal particles (< 450 nm) in mining-impacted environments is a concern because of their potential for greater mobility and ecotoxicity compared to free ion and(or) sediment-bound metals. Metal-contaminated environments may produce soluble metal(loid) particles whose stability and transportability are determined by environmental conditions and particle composition. The Coeur d'Alene River Basin of northern Idaho, USA, is impacted by legacy mine waste-estimated 56 million tonnes of waste rock containing 900,000 t of Pb and 700,000 t of Zn were discharged into the Coeur d'Alene River and its tributaries during mining of argentiferous galena-sphalerite deposits. These legacy disposal practices resulted in substantial metal contamination-including As, Cd, Fe, Pb, Mn, and Zn-of floodplain sediments. Monthly lakewater samples and sediment cores were collected along the shoreline of a metal-contaminated lateral lake of the Coeur d'Alene River. Porewater was extracted from upper and lower sediments to evaluate the formation and stability of dissolved metal particles during seasonal changes. Substantial concentrations of Fe, Pb, Mn, and Zn were present in 450-nm filtered porewater during each month, with variable increases and decreases of metal concentrations in filtered lakewater according to seasonal changes. Dissolved metal particles with an average diameter of 180 +/- 115 nm were present in the porewater of the upper and lower sediments with size increases in early spring and decreases in fall. Particles in the lower sediment porewater were typically more stable, as indicated by more negative zeta potential values, and the greatest particle stability occurred during summer. Differences between upper and lower porewater metal particles correspond to changes in sediment S speciation and bond relocation resulting from an input of oxygenated groundwater. Transport of the dissolved metal particles in and from the sediments likely occurs with a change in the hydraulic gradient during a spring-to-summer transition that induces redox changes and increases particle stability. The presence of mining-related minerals and seasonal changes in environmental conditions allow for formation of dissolved metal particles, but the limited stability of the particles and/or low permeability of the sediments appear to limit, but not fully restrict, possible transport of metal particles to the overlying lakewater.

Application of Otolith Chemistry to Investigate the Origin and State-Straying of Steelhead in Lake Erie Tributaries	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												In Lake Erie, the fishery for steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss is overwhelmingly dominated by stocking from state agencies in Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Managers that stock steelhead may become concerned if a sizeable portion of the fish they stock do not return to the waters in which they were released and instead stray to other states (state-straying). During fall 2009, spring 2010, and spring and fall 2015, we evaluated the origin and state-straying of adult steelhead in five annually stocked tributaries of Lake Erie. We also investigated spatial differences in the origin and state-straying of adult steelhead at different stream locations in two tributaries during 2015. Otolith chemistry signatures were first used to discriminate among yearling steelhead from each of the state hatcheries that stock Lake Erie and wild juveniles from Cattaraugus Creek, New York, and the Grand River, Ontario, resulting in a mean jackknifed classification accuracy of 88% (range=72-100%). Otolith chemistry analysis was then performed on unknown-origin adult steelhead collected in Lake Erie tributaries during the fall and spring spawning runs, and natal sources were identified by using source-specific otolith chemical signatures. State-strays averaged 46% (range=13-88%) of the adult fish collected, and high percentages of strays were identified in Chautauqua Creek, New York (72%), and Cattaraugus Creek (88%). Steelhead collections in these New York tributaries during a second year revealed that the percentage of strays present was consistently high, and large proportions of strays were identified in both upstream and downstream locations. These results suggest that state-straying is widespread in Lake Erie tributaries and that strays make up a large proportion of New York's Lake Erie tributary fishery. Strategies to reduce straying may include practicing upstream releases and reducing the number of hatchery fish that are released in some states.

Daily survival rate (DSR) was high during remigial molt (DSR=0.9987, 95% CI: 0.99671.0000), corresponding to a 39-day period survival rate (PSR) of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.881.00). During fall staging, DSR was markedly lower (DSR=0.9938, 95% CI: 0.98980.9978), corresponding to a PSR of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.530.87) over the 62-day period between the end of remigial molt and fall migration. Half of fall staging mortalities observed on Cardinal Lake were directly attributed to hunting. We conclude that remigial molt is a period with high survival in the annual cycle of Barrow's goldeneyes at our study sites. However, in light of low fall staging survival, Barrow's goldeneye harvest management strategies should be carefully evaluated with intent to reduce risk of localized high mortality at significant staging sites in western Canada.

Temporal and spatial patterns in pelagic trawl fish catches in Lake Winnipeg	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												To better understand patterns of temporal and spatial variation of fish assemblages in offshore waters of Lake Winnipeg (Manitoba, Canada), midwater trawl tows were conducted near lakewide monitoring stations from 2002 to 2008. Trawl samples collected during spring, summer, and fall from the south basin, channel, and north basin were used to study effects of season and geographic region within the lake on species biomass estimates. Within each region, effect of trawl depth was explored. Greatest biomass in trawl catches was from the south basin. Of the most commonly caught species, across all seasons, greater biomass of emerald shiner (Notropis atherinoides) and cisco (Coregonus artedi) were found in the south basin and the channel, compared to the north basin. Biomass of the non-native rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), by contrast, was greater in the north basin compared to the south basin or the channel. Yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and introduced white bass (Morone chrysops) biomass varied temporally and spatially, with greatest biomass captured in the summer in the south basin. Estimated biomass of walleye (Sander vitreus) was greatest in the south basin, followed by the channel, and the north basin. Patterns in species distribution in Lake Winnipeg probably are influenced by a combination of factors, including species interactions and differing temperature and light conditions in the lake. As no lakewide pelagic trawl studies have been reported for this lake, these data form a baseline against which effects of changes, such as lake trophic state or establishment of non-native species, can be assessed.

However, beyond tolerance and reproductive thresholds, little is known about temperature dependence of invaders' performance, particularly in the light of competitive attributes of functionally similar native species. We used experimentally derived energy budgets and field temperature data to determine whether anticipated warming will asymmetrically affect the energy budgets of the globally invasive Ponto-Caspian mysid crustacean Hemimysis anomala and a functionally similar native competitor (Mysis salemaai) whose range is currently being invaded. In contrast to M.salemaai, which maintains a constant feeding rate with temperature leading to diminishing energy assimilation, we found that H.anomala increases its feeding rate with temperature in parallel with growing metabolic demand. This enabled the invader to maintain high energy assimilation rates, conferring substantially higher scope for growth compared to the native analogue at spring-to-autumn temperatures. Anticipated warming will likely exacerbate this energetic asymmetry and remove the winter overlap, which, given the seasonal limitation of mutually preferred prey, appears to underpin coexistence of the two species. These results indicate that temperature-dependent asymmetries in scope for growth between invaders and native analogues comprise an important mechanism determining invasion success under warming climates. They also highlight the importance of considering relevant spectra of ecological contexts in predicting successful invaders and their impacts under warming scenarios.					; Jeschke, Jonathan/A-2707-2008; Donohue, Ian/A-7270-2010	Penk, Marcin/0000-0001-5619-1991; Jeschke, Jonathan/0000-0003-3328-4217; Donohue, Ian/0000-0002-4698-6448													0021-8790	1365-2656				MAR	2016	85	2					419	426		10.1111/1365-2656.12480	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12480								26618450					WOS:000370959300011

Annual development cycle of gonads of bream (Abramis brama L. 1758) females from the lower Oder River sections influenced differently by the heated effluents from a power station	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY					4th International Workshop on the Biology of Fish Gametes	SEP 17-20, 2013	Albufeira, PORTUGAL					Gonads of female bream from three locations with varied temperature-influenced water from power plant cooling water effluents were analysed: (i) from the Oder River (above Gryfino, with no influence of the post-cooling water effluents from the Dolna Odra' power plant, NW Poland), (ii) from Lake Dbie, below the canal receiving the heated effluents from the power station, and (iii) from downstream the effluent canal. Histological analysis indicated that in ambient conditions, the spawning season began at the study sites at the end of April and lasted through May and part of June. The initiation of gonad restoration (beginning of vitellogenesis, stage 3) was observed at the end of July, both in the Oder River and Lake Dbie, and lasted throughout September. The gonads were at stage 4 in males from October to April and, in a few females, to May. The annual cycle of gonad development was similar in the female bream from both sites. The microscopic images of the oocytes were in the previtellogenesis and vitellogenesis at the two sites. The maximum diameter of the oocytes from the Oder was 909.7m, while oocyte diameter of fish from Lake Dbie was 1018.4m. Oocytes not expelled during spawning season (May to August) were seen to undergo atresia. Female gonads from the heated effluent canal did not show any anomalies and the oocytes from the few fish caught in the winter were similar to those from the breams in other locations. Adult bream avoided excessive temperatures in the power plant effluent canal in the spring and summer, whereas juveniles were found in great numbers. In the spring, no female bream with mature gonads were caught in the cooling water effluent canal.

The lowest value of the total abundance was recorded during the spring of 2011 in the central open water body, where unfavorable environmental conditions were recorded. In the peripheral zones the more diversified habitat structure and availability of refuges against fish predation were prerequisites for higher species richness and diversity of the macrozoobenthos communities, as well as for higher total abundance. In the peripheral pools the highest values of both the total abundance and species richness were found in spring. Sorensen's similarity coefficient has shown clear differences between the taxonomic composition of macrozoobenthos in the main distinguished types of habitats - central open water body, peripheral pools within the lake area and a peripheral pool close to the lake. The maximum species similarity was found between spring and summer samples from the central part of the lake. Both indices, percentage of Oligochaeta and PETI, determined clear seasonal changes in ecological state assessment.

J	Jellison, R; Melack, JM				Jellison, R; Melack, JM			Nitrogen limitation and particulate elemental ratios of seston in hypersaline Mono Lake, California, USA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Particulate elemental ratios (C:N, N:P and C:Chl a) of seston in hypersaline (70-90 g kg(-1)) Mono Lake, California, were examined over an 11-year period (1990-2000) which included the onset and persistence of a 5-year period of persistent chemical stratification. Following the onset of meromixis in mid-1995, phytoplankton and dissolved inorganic nitrogen were substantially reduced with the absence of a winter period of holomixis. C:N, N:P and C:Chl a ratios ranged from 5 to 18 mol mol(-)1(,) 2 to 19 mol mol(-1) and 25 to 150 g g(-1), respectively, and had regular seasonal patterns. Deviations from those expected of nutrient-replete phytoplankton indicated strong nutrient limitation in the summer and roughly balanced growth during the winter prior to the onset of meromixis. Following the onset of meromixis, winter ratios were also indicative of modest nutrient limitation. A 3-year trend in C:N and N:P ratios toward more balanced growth beginning in 1998 suggest the impacts of meromixis weakened due to increased upward fluxes of ammonium associated with weakening stratification and entrainment of ammonium-rich monimolimnetic water. A series of nutrient enrichment experiments with natural assemblages of Mono Lake phytoplankton conducted during the onset of a previous episode of meromixis (1982-1986) confirm the nitrogen will limit phytoplankton before phosphorus or other micronutrients. Particulate ratios of a summer natural assemblage of phytoplankton collected under nitrogen-depleted conditions measured initially, following enrichment, and then after return to a nitrogen-depleted condition followed those expected based on Redfield ratios and laboratory studies.

By using a thermal degree-day modeling approach, ice-cover duration on European mountain and sub-Arctic lakes is found to be very sensitive to temperature change. For example, Our model, which incorporates a weather generator, predicts a 100-day shortening in ice-cover duration for a 3 degrees C temperature rise for catchments at elevations of 1500 in in the Southern Alps and the Pyrenees. For the more maritime takes of Scotland., 30% higher sensitivities (130 d per 3 degrees C) are found, whereas lakes in northwest Finland, in a more continental setting, have only half the sensitivity (50 d per 3 degrees C). A pan-European data set of the species abundance of 252 diatom taxa in 459 mountain and sub-Arctic lakes has been compiled and taxonomically harmonized. Transfer functions were created that relate both seasonal air temperature and ice-cover duration to diatom species composition on the basis of a weighted averaging-partial least squares (WA-PLS) approach. Cross validation was used to test the transfer functions. For ice-cover duration the pan-European data set yields an R-squared value of 0.73, a jack-knifed R-squared value of 0.58, and a residual-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 23 days. A regional, northern Fennoscandian transect (151 lakes, 122 taxa) yields a jack-knifed R-squared value of 0.50 and an RMSEP of 9 days. For air temperature the pan-European database displayed temperatures. This result contrasts with greatest skill when reconstructing winter or spring the summer temperatures normally Studied when using local elevation gradients. The northern Fennoscandian transect has a remarkably low winter RMSEP of 0.73 degrees C.

The bivalve culture areas (B-area) are located in the bay head, and the macroalgae culture areas (M-area) are located outside of the B-area. In field investigations, we compared the nanoflagellates (NF) in the B-area and the M-area during 4 seasons. After the field investigations, enclosure experiments were conducted during summer to study the effects of mariculture (bivalves and macroalgae) on NF. In the warm seasons (summer and autumn), during which there was an obvious freshwater input to the bay (especially during summer), NF abundance was negatively related to salinity and was higher in the B-area than in the M-area. In the enclosure experiments, an increase in NF abundance was observed after Day 4 in the bivalve enclosure, but not in the macroalgae enclosure. Considering that the B-area was the area of lower salinity, and the season of largest freshwater input was also the optimal growth season for bivalves, we suggest that the spatial distribution of NF in the warm seasons in Sungo Bay may be influenced by both freshwater input and mariculture.

Exploring the key factors affecting phytoplankton succession and developing predictive models with easily detectable parameters for phytoplankton have been proven to be practical ways to improve water quality. To this end, a systematic survey focused on phytoplankton succession was conducted over 2 years in Lake Erhai. The data from the first study year were used to develop predictive models, and the data from the second year were used for model verification. The seasonal succession of phytoplankton in Lake Erhai was obvious. The dominant groups were Cyanobacteria in the summer, Chlorophyta in the autumn and Bacillariophyta in the winter. The developments and verification of predictive models indicated that compared to phytoplankton biomass, phytoplankton density is more effective for estimating phytoplankton variation in Lake Erhai. CCA (canonical correlation analysis) indicated that TN (total nitrogen), TP (total phosphorus), DO (dissolved oxygen), SD (Secchi depth), Cond (conductivity), T (water temperature), and ORP (oxidation reduction potential) had significant influences (p < 0.05) on the phytoplankton community. The CCA of the dominant species found that Microcystis was significantly influenced by T. The dominant Chlorophyta, Psephonema aenigmaticum and Mougeotia, were significantly influenced by TN. All results indicated that TN and T were the two key factors driving phytoplankton succession in Lake Erhai.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2018	25	2					1283	1293		10.1007/s11356-017-0512-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-0512-2								29086362					WOS:000419944100028

The study design included synoptic sampling of stream water and bed sediments in tributaries and the mainstem, hyporheic-zone/ground water on the mainstem, and seasonal and diurnal sampling of water at selected mainstem sites. The river valley is bordered by gneiss and granite highlands and shale lowlands and underlain by glacial deposits over faulted dolomites and the Franklin Marble. Ore bodies in the Marble, which have been mined for rare Zn ore minerals, also contain As minerals. Tributaries, which drain predominantly forested and agricultural land, contributed relatively little As to the river. The highest concentrations of As (up to 34 mu g/L) emanated from the outlet of man-made Lake Mohawk at the river's headwaters; these inputs varied substantially with season-high during warm months, low during cold months, apparently because of biological activity in the take. Dissolved As concentrations were lower (3.3 mu g/L) in river water than those in ground water discharging into the riverbed (22 mu g/L) near the now-closed Franklin Mine. High total As concentrations (100-190 mg/kg) on the <0.63 mu m fraction of bed sediments near the mine apparently result from sorption of the As in the ground-water discharge as well as from the As minerals in the streambed. As concentrations in river water were diluted during high stream flow in fall, winter and spring, and concentrated during low flow in summer. In unfiltered samples from a wetlands site, diurnal cycles in trace-element concentrations occurred; As concentrations appeared to peak during late afternoon as pH increased, but Fe, Mn, and Zn concentrations peaked shortly after midnight. The temporal variability of As and its presence at elevated concentrations in ground water and sediments as well as streamwater demonstrate the importance of (1) sampling a variety of media and (2) determining the time scales of As variability to fully characterize its passage through a river system.

Spatial and Temporal Variability in a Large-Reservoir Fish Assessment and Application of a Stratified Random Sampling Approach	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Sampling is often standardized with regard to time and space to monitor population characteristics. Effective sampling of large reservoirs can be complicated by the inherit bias of habitat variability along the reservoir gradient. Our objective was to assess spatial and seasonal distribution patterns of target and nontarget fish species in a large reservoir to identify potential sources of bias. A multitude of fish community and habitat characteristics were measured during seasonal (spring, summer, and fall) gill-net surveys in 2015 and 2016 at Lake McConaughy, Nebraska. Spatial assessments along the longitudinal gradient (up-reservoir to down-reservoir) and between opposing shorelines were made for fish metrics from the seven most common species, and associations between species-specific relative abundance and habitat data were examined. Spatial differences in relative abundance and size structure occurred for nearly all species, with the greatest spatial variability occurring between the upper and lower reservoir zones, but few strong correlations were observed between species-specific relative abundances and habitat data. Seasonal differences occurred in relative abundance and size structure for most species, and size structure was lowest in the fall for most species. To reduce the impact of spatial variability, we determined the minimum required sampling effort to achieve precise estimates of mean catch per net-night using two resampling strategies, with 16 or fewer gill-net sets required for five of seven species and 14 or fewer required if a stratified random approach is utilized. This research quantifies the extent of spatial and temporal variability in standardized sampling on a large reservoir and provides novel insight for managers of similar systems considering a stratified random approach to reduce sampling effort while maintaining desired levels of precision.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				OCT	2019	39	5					1086	1102		10.1002/nafm.10343	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10343													WOS:000491488300019

Sequences obtained from the amplicon of V3-V4 regions of 16S rRNA gene revealed that cyanobacterial sequences consisted of 0,35% of total bacterial community sequences only indicating a little contribution to total bacterial biodiversity. Monthly scanned sequences of the parts of cyanobacterial 16S rRNA, Microcystis spp. 16S rRNA, rpoC1 and cpcBA genes showed that cyanobacterial cells were detected only in late spring, summer and early autumn. According to the cloned and randomly selected sequences of rpoC1 and cpcBA regions, most of the sequences were closely related to Microcystis aeruginosa. Although a total of 9 cyanotoxin gene regions were scanned using specific primer pairs only 2 amplicons, mcyB and mcyD of Microcystis spp, were detected through the cyanobacterial representation period of the year. Sequence analyses of cloned mycB gene showed that all the sequences were clustered with Microcystis aeruginosa mcyB gene. Therefore, results of this study indicates that toxigenic and/or non-toxigenic cyanobacterial individuals were represented in the water column of Akgol Lake even they are not abundant among bacterial community members.																			1018-4619	1610-2304					2022	31	3A					3289	3299																WOS:000781628000027

The methods used to quantify sedimentary properties include rock magnetism, grain size analyses, loss-on-ignition (LOI) and bulk density, which when combined has enabled an unmixing of the various sediment components and their corresponding sources. Rockglaciers signify mean annual air temperatures (MAAT) of -4 degrees C or colder, but little is known about their dynamical response to changing thermal regimes. We document here for the first time that a permafrost regime did exist in northern Norway during the lateglacial period, and that it required a lowering equivalent of at least 7 degrees C compared to present-day MAAT. The lake sediments suggest that the rockglacier existed prior to the local deglaciation of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet (> 14 800 cal yr BP), and continued its expansion until the end of the Younger Dryas whereupon it became fossil. The cool climate of the lateglacial was intersected by brief warming spells that caused a systematic release of sedimentladen meltwater from the rockglacier. During the Holocene the minerogenic influx to the lake was driven by spring snowmelting, which are related to the magnitude of winter precipitation. Three phases are recognised: (1) 9800-6500 cal yr BP when wet winters prevailed, (2) 6500-4000 cal yr BP with dry winters, and (3) the last 4000 cal yr BP with a return to wetter winters.

Of the 151 identified taxa, Chrysophyta (57), Chlorophyta (41) and Bacillariophyta (24) predominated in diversity. Over the entire observation period, the highest values of total biomass and total abundance were detected in the IR in June (hydrological spring) at a water temperature of 10.0-12.7 degrees C, and the lowest in August, despite the fact that the water warmed up to 20 degrees C. No mass blooms of Cyanobacteria were observed. Statistical analysis of species abundance profiles revealed that phytoplankton community structure varied across time and space. The direct effect of cold lake waters on the structure of phytoplankton in the reservoir was observed only in early June. In summer and autumn, the structures of phytoplankton in the lake and in the reservoir differed, even at the same water temperature. Low concentrations of phosphates and nitrates, high species diversity, the presence of cold-water species and species with a wide range of temperature preferences formed a dynamic spatiotemporal structure of IR phytoplankton, distinct from other temperate reservoirs, including Lake Baikal. The results obtained are important for understanding the mechanisms of formation of the flora of artificial reservoirs of temperate latitudes and for their monitoring, taking into account seasonal dynamics and the context of global climate warming.

J	Clilverd, H; White, D; Lilly, M				Clilverd, Hannah; White, Daniel; Lilly, Michael			CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL CONTROLS ON THE OXYGEN REGIME OF ICE-COVERED ARCTIC LAKES AND RESERVOIRS	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												We examined the chemical, morphological, and anthropogenic controls on winter-oxygen biogeochemistry in ice-covered lakes and reservoirs on the North Slope of Alaska. We measured dissolved oxygen (DO), solute concentrations, water depth, and ice thickness at three natural thaw lakes and four reservoirs (flooded gravel mines) for two winters. In all seven study sites, DO concentration and pH decreased with depth, and temporally through the winter (November to April). DO concentration was four to six times greater in the deeper reservoirs (8-13 mg/l) compared with shallow natural lakes (ca. 2 mg/l). Lakes and reservoirs with high dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration were susceptible to large decreases in oxygen over the winter. DO concentration differed markedly between years, but was not attributed to changes in water-use or winter water-chemistry. Alternatively, we suggest that dissolved oxygen concentration was lower during freeze-up, possibly associated with higher lake-productivity during the summer. Our results suggest that current water-use practices on the North Slope of Alaska caused little to no change in DO concentration over the winter. In particular, considering the high pumping activity and shallow depth, lakes with low DOC concentration (<= 6 mg/l) showed strong resilience to change in chemistry over the winter. We suggest that both lake and reservoir depth, and DOC concentration are key factors influencing oxygen consumption in ice-covered arctic lakes and reservoirs.																			1093-474X	1752-1688				APR	2009	45	2					500	511		10.1111/j.1752-1688.2009.00305.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2009.00305.x													WOS:000264564400017

The aims of the study were to: 1) characterise and quantify changes in epiphytic macroinvertebrate communities along environmental gradients: 2) assess the contribution of elements of the epiphytic compartment to structuring the community: 3) define the optima and tolerances of selected epiphytic macroinvertebrate taxa for the most relevant ecological factors responsible for assemblage composition; and 4) identify possible epiphytic species assemblages that would allow a logoon's typology to be established, as well as their representative indicator species, Communities showed statistically significant seasonal variation, with two faunal peaks: one in summer, with high chironomid densities, and the other in winter, with high naidid densities. These peaks showed a clear response to the influence of environment factors. Salinity explained the highest percentage of total variance (36%), while trophic variables (nutrients, phytoplanktonic chlorophyll-a, and total organic carbon) and epiphyton biomass (19.2 and 4% of total variance explained, respectively were secondary. Three different epiphytic mocroinvertebrate species assemblages could be defined. These assemblages were directly linked to conductivity conditions, which determined the rate of survival of certain taxa, and to the existence of a direct connection with the sea, which permitted the establishment of "brackish-water", species. In spite of the existence of these species assemblages, the species composition and biomass of epiphytic macroinvertebrates and epiphyton differed substantially between lagoons: both elements were subject to changes in the environment, which finally determined the site-to-site variation in the density and composition of the macroinvertebrate population.

Images covered a period of 7 months, spanning from the ice melting (March) to the late summer (September) of 7 consecutive years (2005-2011). The aim of the study was to analyse the spatial and temporal variations of CDOM, by focusing on the main regulating factors (riverine discharge, sea-lagoon water exchange, water temperature, chlorophyll a, wind) in a large estuary. The working hypothesis is that CDOM distribution may reveal distinct, site specific seasonal patterns. Our results demonstrated that CDOM concentrations at the whole lagoon level were elevated (1.5-4 m(-1)) and slightly but significantly higher in spring (1.50 m(-1) on average) compared to the summer (1.45 m(-1) on average). This is due to very different flow of CDOM-rich freshwater from the main lagoon tributary in spring compared to summer. They also highlight macroscopic differences among areas within the lagoon, depending on season, suggesting a complex regulation of CDOM in this system. Significant factors explaining observed differences are the dilution of lagoon water with CDOM-poor brackish water, regeneration of large amounts of dissolved organic matter from sediments and combinations of uptake/release from phytoplankton. CDOM and its variations are understudied due to inherent methodological and analytical difficulties. However, this pool has a demonstrated relevant role in the biogeochemistry of aquatic environments. We speculate that the dissolved organic pool in the Curonian Lagoon has a mainly allochthonous origin in the high discharge period and an autochthonous origin in the summer, algal bloom period. Both positive and negative relationships between CDOM and phytoplankton suggest that pelagic microalgae may act as a source or as a sink of this pool, in particular when inorganic nutrients are limiting.					; Giardino, Claudia/O-9923-2015; Bučas, Martynas/HKF-0708-2023; Bresciani, Mariano/H-7501-2013; Bartoli, Marco/E-5321-2017	Bucas, Martynas/0000-0003-4668-5669; Bresciani, Mariano/0000-0002-7185-8464; 													1129-5767	1723-8633					2015	74	3					572	583		10.4081/jlimnol.2015.1176	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2015.1176													WOS:000363903200015

The study was carried out from June 2007 to June 2008. The isolation and determination of the number of fungal colonies were conducted with the use of the membrane filter method. Fungal diagnostics were conducted based on the morphological and biochemical characteristics of the fungi. These characteristics were additionally used for taxonomic identification. In the course of the study we isolated 56 species of yeasts and yeast-like fungi belonging to 26 genera, with the predominating genus being Kluyveromyces (13 species), followed by less frequent genera: Candida (8 species), and Debaryomyces (7 species). The highest number of isolates were obtained in the spring (51), fewer in the summer (36), and the lowest in autumn (15). Species indicatory of the self-purifying process of the water examined were frequently isolated (Debaryomyces hansenii, Pichia membranifaciens). Results obtained in the study confirm suggestions of other authors that yeasts and yeast-like fungi may be useful as indicatory organisms showing the extent and character of water contamination and as bioindicators of sanitary and hygienic evaluation of water.

J	Bartholow, JM; Campbell, SG; Flug, M				Bartholow, JM; Campbell, SG; Flug, M			Predicting the thermal effects of dam removal on the Klamath River	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The Klamath River once supported large runs of anadromous salmonids. Water temperature associated with multiple mainstem hydropower facilities might be one of many factors responsible for depressing Klamath salmon stocks. We combined a water quantity model and a water quality model to predict how removing the series of dams below Upper Klamath Lake might affect water temperatures, and ultimately fish survival, in the spawning and rearing portions of the mainstem Klamath. We calibrated the water quantity and quality models and applied them for the hydrometeorological conditions during a 40-year postdam period. Then, we hypothetically removed the dams and their impoundments from the models and reestimated the river's water temperatures. The principal thermal effect of dam and reservoir removal would be to restore the timing ( phase) of the river's seasonal thermal signature by shifting it approximately 18 days earlier in the year, resulting in river temperatures that more rapidly track ambient air temperatures. Such a shift would likely cool thermal habitat conditions for adult fall chinook ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) during upstream migration and benefit mainstem spawning. By contrast, spring and early summer temperatures could be warmer without dams, potentially harming chinook rearing and outmigration in the mainstem. Dam removal might affect the river's thermal regime during certain conditions for over 200 km of the mainstem.																			0364-152X					DEC	2004	34	6					856	874		10.1007/s00267-004-0269-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-004-0269-5								15726283					WOS:000227236800008
J	Lappalainen, J; Malinen, T				Lappalainen, Jyrki; Malinen, Tommi			Hydroacoustics and concurrent experimental trawling reveal extreme annual variation in the density of 0+pikeperch in late summer	FISHERIES RESEARCH												The density and mean size of 0 + pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) were studied in late summer in 2004-2017 in clay-turbid and eutrophic Lake Tuusulanjarvi in southern Finland. Hydroacoustics and simultaneous experimental trawling were used to estimate the density of 0 + pikeperch. In some autumns, 0 + pikeperch was the most abundant species in the pelagic fish assemblage. However, the annual amplitude of pikeperch density was extremely high (1,300 -19,900 individuals ha(-1)). The density and size variations of 0 + pikeperch were analysed in relation to air temperature sums and degree days. Unexpectedly, the density of 0 + pikeperch showed no correlation with the air temperature sums or degree days, but both the mean length and weight of 0 + pikeperch correlated positively with these temperature variables. The highest correlation coefficients between mean size and temperature were found with temperature sums over 10 degrees C and degree days over 5 degrees C. The correlation between density and condition of 0 + pikeperch was negative but non-significant. The high density of 0 + pikeperch in some autumns suggests that pikeperch may play a central role in the pelagic food web in eutrophic lakes - not only as a predator of planktivores but also by its own planktivory.

J	Armengol, X; Esparcia, A; Miracle, MR				Armengol, X; Esparcia, A; Miracle, MR			Rotifer vertical distribution in a strongly stratified lake: a multivariate analysis	HYDROBIOLOGIA					VIIIth International Rotifer Symposium	JUN 22, 1997	ST JOHNS UNIV, COLLEGEVILLE, MN		ST JOHNS UNIV			The main source of variation of rotifer species distributions in lake Arcas-2, a small karstic lake near Cuenca (Spain), was explored by means of principal components factor (PCA) and canonical correlation (CCA) analyses. PCA was performed using rotifer densities and CCA using rotifer densities plus physical and chemical parameters. Factor 1 of PCA separated summer species from winter-spring species and Factor 2 accounted for the variation in the vertical profile. Three summer species with different food habits (Polyarthra dolichoptera, Hexarthra mira and Asplanchna girodi) were grouped together at the positive end of Factor 1, while Factor 2 separated the two hypolimnetic species (Filinia hofmanni and Anuraeopsis fissa) from the rest. The relative position of rotifer species in the space determined by the CCA was roughly the same. The most significant environmental factors that became paired with rotifer distribution in the CCA were temperature and oxygen, and parameters related to water inflow. Segregation of filter-feeding species in the spatio-temporal subenvironments is clearly shown by the multivariate analysis. The low diversity of rotifer species found in Lake Arcas-2 is attributed to the reduced dimensions of the lake and its morphology. This lake resembles a sinkhole with an abruptly sloping shoreline and poor development of the littoral zone. This morphology favors a strong oxygen stratification. Since midsummer the oxic-anoxic boundary is located in the upper metalimnion, the vertical structure of the oxygenated water column is simplified. This low rotifer diversity contrasts with a high ciliate diversity in the anoxic waters.

Particularly, the ice-thermal feedbacks caused by the ice sheet on the Tibetan Plateau have pronounced effects in the interannual surface-heat anomaly and local-toremote atmospheric circulations. However, its long-term variations and impacts in terms of melt-freeze dynamics remain mysterious. Our results are based on decadal resolved difference between two oxygen isotope records during the past 12,000 years from Donggi Cona Lake, north-eastern Tibetan Plateau. They indicate surface-heat anomaly-caused air-temperature variabilities, which were about -3 degrees C in springs 9,500 years ago and 2 degrees C in autumns afterwards on average, independent from insolation strength. We find that increasing autumn air-temperature variability generated large-scaled vertical convections over the Plateau 4,500 years ago. Since then, the recent Tibetan Plateau thermal forcing centre formed with the noted increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission. The predicted increasing autumn air-temperature with greenhouse effect portends future higher atmospheric sensitivity. We anticipate Holocene ice-ages to be tipping points of the coupled surface-atmosphere climate changes.																			1342-937X	1878-0571				SEP	2025	145						29	35		10.1016/j.gr.2025.05.007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gr.2025.05.007													WOS:001502129400001

These floods caused extensive damage, killing people and livestock as well as destroying property and crops. Using satellite data analysis and field surveys of this area, we find that the water volume that drained at Kashkasuu glacial lake in 2006 was 194 000 m3, at western Zyndan lake in 2008 was 437 000m(3), at Jeruy lake in 2013 was 182 000m(3), and at Karateke lake in 2014 was 123 000m(3). Due to their subsurface outlet, we refer to these short-lived glacial lakes as the "tunnel-type", a type that drastically grows and drains over a few months. From spring to early summer, these lakes either appear, or in some cases, significantly expand from an existing lake (but non-stationary), and then drain during summer. Our field surveys show that the short-lived lakes form when an ice tunnel through a debris landform gets blocked. The blocking is caused either by the freezing of stored water inside the tunnel during winter or by the collapse of ice and debris around the ice tunnel. The draining then occurs through an opened ice tunnel during summer. The growth-drain cycle can repeat when the ice-tunnel closure behaves like that of typical supraglacial lakes on debris-covered glaciers. We argue here that the geomorphological characteristics under which such short-lived glacial lakes appear are (i) a debris landform containing ice (ice-cored moraine complex), (ii) a depression with water supply on a debris landform as a potential lake basin, and (iii) no visible surface outflow channel from the depression, indicating the existence of an ice tunnel. Applying these characteristics, we examine 60 depressions (>0.01 km(2)) in the study region and identify here 53 of them that may become short-lived glacial lakes, with 34 of these having a potential drainage exceeding 10m(3) s(-1) at peak discharge.					; Daiyrov, Mirlan/AAH-8589-2019; Duishonakunov / Дуйшонакунов, Murataly / Мураталы/F-4023-2018; Kääb, Andreas/AAG-8769-2020	Kaab, Andreas/0000-0002-6017-6564; Narama, Chiyuki/0000-0002-8233-9053													1561-8633					APR 3	2018	18	4					983	995		10.5194/nhess-18-983-2018	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/nhess-18-983-2018													WOS:000429059500001

PAHs, NITRO-PAHs, HOPANES, AND STERANES IN LAKE TROUT FROM LAKE MICHIGAN	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												The present study examines concentrations and risks of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), nitro-PAHs (NPAHs), steranes, and hopanes in lake trout collected in Lake Michigan. A total of 74 fish were collected in 2 seasons at 3 offshore sites. The total PAH concentration (Sigma(9)PAH) in whole fish ranged from 223 pg/g to 1704 pg/g wet weight, and PAH concentrations and profiles were similar across season, site, and sex. The total NPAH (Sigma(9)NPAH) concentrations ranged from 0.2 pg/g to 31 pg/g wet weight, and carcinogenic compounds, including 1-nitropyrene and 6-nitrochrysene, were detected. In the fall, NPAH concentrations were low at the Illinois site (0.2-0.5 pg/g wet wt), and site profiles differed considerably; in the spring, concentrations and profiles were similar across sites, possibly reflecting changes in fish behavior. In the fall, the total sterane (Sigma(5)Sterane) and total hopane (Sigma(2)Hopane) levels reached 808 pg/g and 141 pg/g wet weight, respectively, but concentrations in the spring were 10 times lower. Concentrations in eggs (fall only) were on the same order of magnitude as those in whole fish. These results demonstrate the presence of target semivolatile organic compounds in a top predator fish, and are consistent with PAH biodilution observed previously. Using the available toxicity information for PAHs and NPAHs, the expected cancer risk from consumption of lake trout sampled are low. However, NPAHs contributed a significant portion of the toxic equivalencies in some samples. The present study provides the first measurements of NPAHs in freshwater fish, and results suggest that additional assessment is warranted.

Mark-recapture techniques and standardized dip-net surveys were used to monitor Argia vivida at various life stages. A reproductive index identified which sites Argia vivida recognized as suitable breeding habitat, and exuvia surveys confirmed breeding sites. The basic structure of emergent and surrounding vegetation was measured to investigate the importance of available ovipositing or roosting sites and the condition of the matrix habitat. Data was recorded for Amphiagrion abbreviatum and Ischnura cervula (both Odonata: Coenagrionidae) to determine if these spring-associated damselflies were successfully breeding within Banff National Park. Comparisons were made between the highly protected Middle Springs and the heavily altered Cave & Basin Springs. Additional surveys at the Vermilion Lake cool spring and Middle Springs Bog investigated their use as breeding habitat for Amphiagrion abbreviatum and Argia vivida, respectively. Results suggest the ecological value of thermal springs extends beyond their origin to outflows and downstream pools. Conservation of Argia vivida must recognize the value of unobstructed thermal outflows, and consider the condition of the forested habitat surrounding springs with regard to its potential use as nocturnal roosts and dispersal corridors. Amphiagrion abbreviatum was confirmed breeding within Banff National Park, while no sign of breeding activity was recorded for Ischnura cervula.																			1386-2588					MAR	2006	40	1					49	58		10.1007/s10452-005-9017-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-005-9017-z													WOS:000235545900005

While such models represent a tremendous advance in (palaeo) ecology, they leave behind important sources of uncertainties that are often ignored. In the present study we tackle two of the most important sources of uncertainty in the development of diatom salinity inference models: the effect of secondary variables associated to seasonality and the comparison of conventional cross-validation methods with a validation based on independent datasets. Samples (diatoms and environmental variables) were taken in spring, summer and autumn in the freshwater and brackish ditches of the province of North Holland in 1993. Different locations of the same province were sampled again in 2008-2010 to validate the models. We found that the abundance of the dominant species significantly changed between the seasons, leading to inconsistent estimates of species optima and tolerances. A model covering intra-annual variability (all seasons combined) provides averages of species optima and tolerances, reduces the effect of secondary variables due to the seasonality effects, thus providing the strongest relationship between salinity and diatom species. In addition, the all-season - model also reduces the edge effects usually found in all unimodal-based calibration methods. While based on cross-validation all four models seem to perform relatively well, a validation with an independent dataset emphasizes the importance of using models covering intra-annual variability to perform realistic reconstructions.					; Cvetkoska, Aleksandra/AAJ-2225-2020; Wagner-Cremer, Friederike/B-4225-2009; Vilar, Alejandra/ABF-9323-2020; Donders, Timme/J-5044-2012	Donders, Timme/0000-0003-4698-3463; GOLDENBERG VILAR, ALEJANDRA/0000-0002-6898-3555; Wagner-Cremer, Friederike/0000-0002-8119-3558; 													1932-6203					NOV 20	2018	13	11							e0199343	10.1371/journal.pone.0199343	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0199343								30458002					WOS:000450775300003

Methane Emissions from Lakes and Reservoirs: Uncertainties Due to the Formation and Break-up of the Ice Cover	IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS												Methane is the second most potent greenhouse gas (GHG) in the earth's atmosphere contributing to global warming (after carbon dioxide). Freshwater bodies (lakes and reservoirs), being the most significant source of methane on a global scale, are distributed over the earth's surface in such a way that the bulk of them is covered with ice for several months of the year. During the freeze-up, the water column is isolated from the atmosphere, so methane emissions cease or become restricted to open holes and cracks in the ice cover. Methane accumulated both under ice and within ice-trapped gas bubbles is released at spring ice melt. This review article examines in detail the ways methane is released from the bottom of seasonally ice-covered lakes and reservoirs and the mechanisms of methane accumulation in their water column and ice cover, as well as under-ice processes facilitating and impeding such an accumulation. Factors controlling methane emissions at spring ice melt and current approaches for estimating the magnitude of these emissions are also discussed. The data systematized in the article can be used for (1) planning field studies on seasonally ice-covered water bodies throughout winter and spring and (2) the development of process-oriented models that take into account the influence of ice cover on the spatiotemporal carbon dynamics of freshwater ecosystems and methane emissions from these ecosystems.

This, combined with the possibility of multi-temporal coverage, makes CHRIS-PROBA exceptionally well suited for lake water monitoring. The concept of the project MEMAMON is to monitor the water quality of lakes in the Mecklenburg (Germany) and Mazurian (Poland) lake districts. Both test sites contain a large number of lakes with high variability and different trophic states. This paper presents a study, which aims to determine the trophic parameter chlorophyll-a using hyperspectral CHRIS-PROBA data. To investigate the seasonal dynamics of lakes, CHRIS-PROBA data were acquired in spring, summer and autumn 2002, 2003 and 2004. A first analysis of the data showed that CHRIS radiance data have strong artefacts in along track direction. Standard destriping techniques were not sufficient to correct the data. Therefore, a novel iterative destriping technique was developed and successfully applied to CHRIS-PROBA data. During the CHRIS-PROBA data recording, spectral field measurements and acquisition of in-situ data took 0 place at several test sites. Using these data, chlorophyll algorithms were developed and optimised to the spectral characteristics of the CHRIS sensor. On the basis of simulated CHRIS-PROBA spectra in mode 2 and mode 3, the effect on the chlorophyll estimation will be discussed.

The lake is monomictic, oligotrophic, and for much of each year has a deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) located near the bottom of the euphotic zone (20-25 m). Epilimnetic chlorophyll concentrations are low (ca. 0.5 .mu.g .cntdot. L-1) in summer, and DCM concentrations are from three to 10 times higher. The diatom Rhizosolenia eriensis was a dominant species in the epilimnion in spring and at the DCM for much of the year, but was rare in the epilimnion during summer, and consequently was not affected by the nutrient additions. Cyclotella spp. were also abundant in spring, were a prominent component of the DCM and increased in abundance during nutrient additions. The cyanobacterium Synechococcus was the dominant member of the autotrophic picoplankton community and during the nutrient additions densities reached 300,000 .cntdot. mL-1 (a 10-fold increase). Bacterioplankton numbers also increased during nutrient additions, at times exceeding 3.0 .times. 106 .cntdot. mL-1. The DCM was formed and maintained by sinking cells, by occasional active photosynthesis at the DCM, and by an increase in chlorophyll/cell.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				FEB	1990	47	2					262	273		10.1139/f90-029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f90-029													WOS:A1990CN64400004
J	POWER, ME				POWER, ME			HYDROLOGIC AND TROPHIC CONTROLS OF SEASONAL ALGAL BLOOMS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA RIVERS	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Cladophora glomerata L., a dominant macroalga in lakes and rivers worldwide, undergoes a marked bloom-detachment-senescence cycle in unregulated rivers of northern California with natural winter flood, summer drought flow regimes. In two regulated channels which probably did not experience scouring floods, however, low standing crops of attached Cladophora turf persisted throughout the year. The contrast between Cladophora phenology in regulated and unregulated rivers suggests that Cladophora cycles may be extrinsically driven by factors related to the hydrograph. Preliminary data on seasonal patterns of animal abundance in regulated and unregulated channels suggest that winter flooding promotes Cladophora blooms in rivers by reducing consumer densities. A working hypothesis relating hydrologic regime, food chain length, and algal phenology in rivers is advanced. This hypothesis predicts that pronounced algal bloom-detachment-senescence cycles will occur in unregulated rivers in Mediterranean climates following winter flooding, and that blooms will not occur in the absence of flooding in regulated channels, or in natural rivers during prolonged drought.																			0003-9136					OCT	1992	125	4					385	410																WOS:A1992JW02800001
J	Prowse, TD; Stephenson, RL				Prowse, Terry D.; Stephenson, Robert L.			The Relationship Between Winter Lake Cover, Radiation Receipts and the Oxygen Deficit in Temperate Lakes	ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN												The composition, timing and duration of winter lake cover are shown to produce significant spatial and temporal variations in the radiation received at the surface of the water column, and are linked to the timing and rate of oxygen depletion of a temperate lake. In particular, the first snowfall to accumulate on the ice cover reduces radiation input to nearly zero and coincides with the initiation of the linear phase of oxygen depletion. Ablation of the snow cover in spring results in increased radiation receipts and oxygen levels. A simple model shows that the conversion of snow to white ice, which normally occurs during the midwinter period, increases radiation receipts and oxygen levels. Manipulation of the cover by artificially induced slushing is suggested as a management technique in the control of winter oxygen deficits.

To better understand the dynamics of both pelagic and benthic Microcystis and their characteristics in Lake Caohai, we conducted a 1-year investigation from December 2015 to December 2016 to gain a seasonal outlook on the distribution and dynamics of cell abundance, colony size and intracellular microcystins (MCs) of Microcystis. The results indicated that the Microcystis bloom occupied primarily the northeastern region and then moved gradually from lakeshore to lake center. The perennial southwesterly winds and the water inflow from northeast to southwest in Lake Caohai determined the spatiotemporal distribution of pelagic Microcystis. Benthic Microcystis was mainly distributed in the northeastern region in summer, occupied the lake center in autumn and then occupied the southeastern region in winter, determined by the sedimentation of pelagic Microcystis and the death of benthic Microcystis. Small colonies (20-60 mu m) overwintered more easily in both water column and sediment. The concentrations of intracellular toxin of benthic Microcystis were observed to be significantly higher than those of pelagic Microcystis. This might be because Microcystis synthesized large amount of MCs to acclimate to an unfavorable benthic environment. This knowledge on the dynamics of Microcystis expands our understanding of mechanisms underpinning the formation of Microcystis blooms.

In this work, six-year observations were performed to study the comprehensive climatologic characteristics of lake breezes on North China's urban inland lake, Lake Hengshui (75 km2). By removing background winds calculated by ERA5 data and successfully recording the lake-land breeze cycle, we devised a succinct and effective approach for distinguishing lake-land breezes. Lake-land breeze had a high annual occurrence frequency of 13.4%-24.7% and a yearly mean lake-breeze speed of 1.6 m/s and yearly mean lake-breeze duration of 4.8 h; spring has the highest frequency and summer has the lowest frequency because of the greater thermal differences between lake and land in spring. The lake breeze mostly started at 06:00-07:00 and 10:00-13:00 (LST), showing a double-peak pattern, and ended at 17:00-19:00 (LST). On the other hand, the land breezes mainly started at 00:00-01:00 (LST) and ended at 05:00-06:00. The distance between each station and the lake has a negative correlation to the frequency and duration of the lake-land breeze, showing the higher frequency and duration at the near stations and the lower frequency and duration at the stations far from the lake. The land breeze has similar spatial characteristics.

The N content of each fraction was measured by UV photolysis. About 25-30% of the yellow acid and white precipitate fractions were lost from the water column in each of the lakes during winter. More than 80% of the organic N dissolved in the lake water samples was found in the aqueous fraction. The white precipitate is probably part of the humin material in lake waters because it is relatively insoluble in acidic and alkaline solutions.																			0270-5060	2156-6941					1981	1	2					193	202		10.1080/02705060.1981.9664031	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1981.9664031													WOS:A1981MQ05000007

The watershed vegetation and its carbon sequestration capacity have changed dramatically due to climate change and human activities in the last two decades. In this paper, the monthly and annual vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) of the Dongting Lake basin during 2000 to 2020 was firstly estimated using the improved Carnegie-Ames -Stanford Approach (CASA) model. Then the multi-year NPP change trend and its significance were analyzed based on Theil-Sen median and Mann-Kendall method. Subsequently, the Hurst index was used to simulate the vegetation NPP persistence in the study area. Finally, the driving mechanisms of vegetation NPP changes in the study area were explored using partial correlation coefficients and residual analysis. The results demonstrated that: 1) The annual average NPP in the basin showed a fluctuating and increasing trend from 273.54 to 718.30 g C/m2 center dot yr1 during 2000 to 2020, and except for autumn, all seasons (spring, summer, winter) and annual NPP series showed an upward trend. The spatial distribution of vegetation NPP is characterized by an asymmetrical horseshoe shape in general, with high values in the west, south and east parts, and low values in the Lake area; 2) During the study years, about 84.38 % of the basin area showed a significant and extremely significant increase of NPP; 3) The future trend of vegetation NPP in the basin shows that the area of decrease (22.79 %) is more than the area of increase (11.35 %). The Chang-Zhu-Tan urban agglomeration will generally show a continuous and extremely significant reduction trend, while parts of Dongting Lake will show a continuous and extremely significant increase trend; 4) The correlation between solar radiation and NPP is stronger than the other two meteorological factors (precipitation and temperature). Temperature has a significant inhibitory effect on NPP, solar radiation has a significant promoting effect on NPP, and the effect of precipitation on NPP was relatively complicated. The relative importance of meteorological factors on vegetation NPP was ranked as follows: solar radiation > precipitation > temperature. The impacts of both climate change and human activities on NPP changes showed great spatial variability, and the positive contributions (89.81 % for climate change and 82.87 % for human activities) were both greater than the negative contributions.(c) 2022 COSPAR.

A sequence from the shallow mountain lake Basa de la Mora (1914 m a.s.l., Central Pyrenees) was analysed and the reconstruction was performed by means of a merged Norwegian-Swiss chironomid calibration dataset. The presence of a multiproxy study conducted in the same lake, as well as other available regional temperature estimations, allowed the comparison of our results with distinct local and regional records in order to disentangle different temperature and hydrological and seasonal patterns throughout the Holocene. The sampling resolution does not allow analysing rapid climatic oscillations, but provides insights into general Holocene trends. Overall, we found increasing temperatures at the onset of the Holocene, reaching the highest values during the Holocene Climatic Optimum (in our record ca. 7800 cal. yr BP). High temperatures were observed until ca. 6000 yr BP, when a decline of ca. 1.5oC was inferred and the lowest temperature values throughout the sequence were reconstructed during the period 4200-2000 cal. yr BP coinciding with the first part of the late Holocene. Finally, an increasing trend in temperature values characterized the last two millennia, although we interpret this reconstructed temperature rise with caution as distinguishing between climatic and anthropogenic influences on the chironomid record in this youngest section of the Holocene is challenging.

However, such lakes are subject to great fluctuations in its size depending on climatic conditions and human water utilization. The Orog Lake is one such example that has shown remarkable fluctuation in recent years. In this study, we investigated the temporal changes of Orog Lake surface area by using 16-day MODIS 250 m NDVI products from 2000 to 2010. The results were compared with climate variability represented by monthly precipitation and temperature. Our results show that the Orog Lake gradually shrank for the period from 2000 to 2010, but with a significant range of seasonal and inter-annual variability. The lake area showed considerable seasonal variations, as it expanded in spring and fall, primarily due to snow melt and summer precipitation, respectively. Extreme drought period from 2000 to 2002 triggered the substantial reduction in lake area, leading to dry-up in year 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2009. After dry-up once occurred in 2005, the lake repeated reappearance and disappearance depending on seasonal and annual precipitation. Our findings implicate that the ground water fluctuated around the lake bottom level since 2005. This suggests the highly vulnerable nature of Orog lake, which greatly depends on future precipitation change.

J	Taastrom, HM; Jacobsen, L				Taastrom, HM; Jacobsen, L			The diet of otters (Lutra lutra L.) in Danish freshwater habitats:: comparisons of prey fish populations	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Otter spraints from five Danish freshwater localities were analysed. In all localities fish was the main prey (76-99% of estimated bulk), especially in winter. Depending on locality, the prey fish mainly consisted of cyprinids (Cyprinidae), percids (Percidae) or salmonids (Salmonidae). Seasonal variations were found in the diet corresponding to the availability of prey. Non-fish prey categories, such as frogs, birds, mammals and invertebrates, were most frequently taken in spring and summer, but only frogs made an important contribution to the diet (0-21%). The results of analysing 978 otter spraints were compared with prey fish populations as estimated by electrofishing. It was concluded that the fish species composition in the otter diet generally reflected that of the foraging area, however, with the exception of a negative preference for trout (Salmo sp.) and a preference for sticklebacks (Gasterosteidae) in some of the study areas. Otters generally took all available sizes of fish with a tendency for selecting individuals between 9-21 cm, though the preferred size of eels was 18-36 cm. A principal component analysis showed that the variation in diet between the localities was associated with differences in fish communities between free-flowing rivers and lake outflows.																			0952-8369					MAY	1999	248		1				1	13																WOS:000080937800001

As one of the important water quality eval-uation indicators, suspended particulate matter (SPM) is also relevant to the ecology of the estuary. However, the current research on SPM of surface water is quite well established. It is urgent to study the vertical distribution of SPM due to its significance for further studies of biogeochemical processes in the water column. This study developed remote estimation model of SPM for five different depth water layers in the Liaohe estuary based on in situ Rrs(lambda) data and support vector regression (SVR) methods, and the model performed well (RMSE = 24.32 mg/ L, MAPE = 26.11%, MAE = 18.37 mg/L, N = 115). After applying the model to 10,090 MODIS images collected in 2000-2021, results show that: (1) Vertical distribution of SPM concentration in the Liaohe estuary could be divided into three types: top-down decreasing type (Type I), uniform type (Type II) and top-down increasing type (Type III). (2) Seasonal distribution of SPM concentration in the Liaohe estuary is: medium in spring (76.30 +/- 10.34 mg/L), low in summer (61.80 +/- 6.98 mg/L) and high in autumn (82.28 +/- 19.12 mg/L). There is a sig-nificant decreasing trend of SPM from 2000 to 2021 (p < 0.01). (3) Meteorological factors (wind speed and precipitation), water depth, human reforestation and reclamation activities are closely related to SPM concentration.

Carl; Budy, Phaedra			A Lota lota Consumption: Trophic Dynamics of Nonnative Burbot in a Valuable Sport Fishery	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Unintentional and illegal introductions of species disrupt food webs and threaten the success of managed sport fisheries. Although many populations of Burbot Lota lota are declining in the species' native range, a nonnative population recently expanded into Flaming Gorge Reservoir (FGR), Wyoming-Utah, and threatens to disrupt predator-prey interactions within this popular sport fishery. To determine potential impacts on sport fishes, especially trophy Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush, we assessed the relative abundance of Burbot and quantified the potential trophic or food web impacts of this population by using diet, stable isotope, and bioenergetic analyses. We did not detect a significant potential for food resource competition between Burbot and Lake Trout (Schoener's overlap index = 0.13), but overall consumption by Burbot likely affects other sport fishes, as indicated by our analyses of trophic niche space. Diet analyses suggested that crayfish were important diet items across time (89.3% of prey by weight in autumn; 49.4% in winter) and across Burbot size-classes (small: 77.5% of prey by weight; medium: 76.6%; large: 39.7%). However, overall consumption by Burbot increases as water temperatures cool, and fish consumption by Burbot in FGR was observed to increase during winter. Specifically, large Burbot consumed more salmonids, and we estimated (bioenergetically) that up to 70% of growth occurred in late autumn and winter. Further, our population-wide consumption estimates indicated that Burbot could consume up to double the biomass of Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss stocked annually (>1.3 x 10(5) kg; >1 million individuals) into FGR.

The studied paleo-maar core sediment has two restricted source materials with distinctively different geochemical signatures: Asian dust blown from central Asia (especially northern China and Mongolia) and basement rock composed of trachybasalt. The REE characteristics of sediments depend on the relative contribution of these two sources and thus can be used to delineate the monsoon climate in Jeju Island. The proportion of Asian dust generally decreased gradually from 67% at 22,300 cal BP, indicative of progressive weakening of the winter monsoon strength in central Asia. Integration of the REE data with TOC and MS records reveals that the summer monsoon strength in Jeju Island decreased from 22,300 cal BP until the last glacial maximum at 18,000 cal BP, and then increased to 14,000 cal BP. The abrupt intensification of the summer monsoon occurred from 14,000 to 13,300 cal BP, followed by the weakened summer monsoon from 13,300 to 11,000 cal BP, in anti-phase with the strengthened winter monsoon in central Asia. In the early Holocene, Jeju Island experienced further intensified summer monsoon strength. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Especially in winter and spring, freshwater ecosystems lacking large submerged plants are the most vulnerable. However, there is a paucity of research on the combined effects of global warming and eutrophication on the water quality of freshwater ecosystems and the growth characteristics of submerged plants in winter and spring. We therefore performed a mesocosm experiment examining the combined effects of nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) enrichment and warming (2.65 +/- 0.07 degrees C) on the submerged plant Potamogeton crispus. We found that warming affected the morphological characteristics of P. crispus, promoted plant height, accumulated more biomass, augmented the proportion of above-ground biomass and decreased the nitrogen content of the aboveground organs. Meanwhile, warming increased more resources for asexual reproduction (turions) and reduced the number of flowers. The addition of nitrogen or phosphorus alone could significantly augment the content of nitrogen or phosphorus in vegetative organs, respectively. In addition, the effects of different nutrient enrichment on the reproduction strategy of P. crispus were different. The addition of nitrogen reduced the number of flowers, while the addition of phosphorus augmented the number of flowers and turions. In contrast, the warming and co-addition of nitrogen and phosphorus treatments had a more negative effect on P. crispus, reducing biomass, maximum fluorescence and the number of ramets, flowers and turions. Although the leaf biomass allocation increased, the turion biomass allocation decreased. This may be due to the increase in algae, turbidity and total suspended solids caused by warming and the co-addition of nitrogen and phosphorus, which stressed the growth of P. crispus. Our results suggest that global warming and eutrophication can affect the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems by inhibiting the growth of submerged plants, which may lead to further fragile stability of freshwater ecosystems in winter and spring.					; Xu, Xinwei/AAV-7391-2020; Liu, Chunhua/KIC-3397-2024	Yan, Zhiwei/0000-0002-5151-8593; Li, Yang/0000-0001-8555-0201; 													0098-8472	1873-7307				OCT	2021	190								104572	10.1016/j.envexpbot.2021.104572	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2021.104572		JUL 2021											WOS:000685009900007

However, understanding the changes in HWEs on the TP is limited, primarily from analyses at individual stations or single elements (glaciers, lakes). Here, using refined data, we quantify the heatwave magnitude by aggregating multiple indicators into a comprehensive index and explore the influence of environmental factors on the heatwave magnitude over the TP. Our findings indicate that the heatwave magnitude has significantly increased since the 21st century, especially in autumn. From 1979-2000 to 2001-2022, the heatwave magnitude hotspots migrated toward the northwestern TP, whereas the regions with the most rapid increase shifted in the opposite direction. During the inter-seasonal, from spring to winter, the migration direction of the heatwave magnitude hotspots changed from the northwest in the first 22 years (1979-2000) to the southeast in the recent 22 years (2001-2022). We also find that downward shortwave radiation plays a significant role in the spatial stratified heterogeneity (SSH) of the heatwave magnitude, while the trend of temperature plays a dominant role in the SSH of the trend of heatwave magnitude. Moreover, elevation is correlated with the heatwave magnitude variability. The elevation-dependence of the heatwave magnitude has become more pronounced in the recent 22 years, with a high-heatwave magnitude migrating to higher elevations. Furthermore, the difference in land cover type can also affect the intensity of the heatwave magnitude to some extent. Our findings underscore the migration patterns of the heatwave magnitude evolution around the 21st century and provide a scientific basis for understanding the interaction between environmental factors and the heatwave magnitude in different periods.

Biogeochemical cycling in forest soils of the eastern Sierra Nevada Mountains, USA	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												We review some of the unique features of biogeochemical cycling in forests of the eastern Sierra Nevada Mountains, USA. As is the case for most and and semi-arid ecosystems, spatial and temporal variability in nutrient contents and fluxes are quite high. "Islands of fertility" are common in these forests, a result of spatial variations in both litterfall and decomposition rates. Dry summer conditions greatly inhibit biological activity in the O horizon, and thus most annual litter decomposition takes place beneath the snowpack when moisture is available. Snowmelt duration is shortened near tree holes because of local warming, resulting in earlier drying of the O horizon, significantly lower decomposition rates, and increased O horizon mass. Water and nutrient fluxes vary spatially because of snowdrift in winter and surface runoff over hydrophobic soils in summer and fall. Moisture variability in the vertical as well as the horizontal dimension has significant consequences for nutrient fluxes. Because of the very dry summers, rooting in the O horizons is absent in these forests, and thus competition between microbes and trees for nutrients in that horizon is non-existent. Nutrients mineralized from the O horizon and not taken up by plants enrich runoff through the O horizons over hydrophobic mineral soils, resulting in very high concentrations of inorganic N and P in runoff waters. Substantial temporal variations in water and nutrient fluxes occur on a seasonal (with snowmelt being the dominant hydrologic event of the year), annual, and decadal basis. The most significant temporal variation is due to periodic fire, which we estimate causes annualized N losses that are two orders of magnitude greater than those associated with leaching and runoff. We hypothesize that fire suppression during the 20th century may have contributed to the deterioration of nearby Lake Tahoe by allowing buildups of N and P in O horizons which could subsequently leach from the terrestrial ecosystem to the Lake in runoff. In general, we conclude that biogeochemical cycling in these forests is characterized by greater spatial and temporal variability than in more mesic forest ecosystems. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Sex and season influence behaviour and physiology of lake trout following angling	CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY												We examined impacts of catch-and-release angling on lake trout angled during the summer and fall spawning season. We measured reflexes, blood indices, and, briefly, post-release locomotor activity. Temperature, season, angling depth, and sex influenced many responses. Anglers should employ context-specific practices to prevent negative outcomes when angling for lake trout. Catch-and-release angling exposes fish to challenges that may result in sub-lethal effects or mortality. Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) undergo high rates of release because of size-based harvest regulations or voluntary angler behaviour. Here, we examine short-term impairment in lake trout angled during the summer (n = 74) and fall spawning period (n = 33) to inform best practices for angling. Immediately following capture or 0.5 h post-capture, fish underwent reflex and barotrauma assessments, and a small blood sample was collected. Fish were also fitted with an externally mounted biologger equipped with depth, temperature and tri-axial acceleration sensors, that was tethered to allow retrieval of the logger after 14 min. In the summer, reflex impairment and barotrauma at 0 and 0.5 h were significantly correlated. Loss of orientation and bloating were the most observed indicators. Larger fish and those captured at increased depth had higher barotrauma scores, while prolonged fight times decreased the barotrauma score regardless of sampling time. Plasma cortisol, lactate and glucose increased 0.5 h after capture, and extracellular and intracellular pH decreased, all signs that angling was inducing a metabolic response. However, no relationships were found between blood indices and mortality (18.9%). The time required to reach maximum depth after release was longer for fish with increased air exposure but shorter for those with longer fight times. During the fall, fish displayed no mortality or reflex impairment. Anal prolapse was the most observed indicator of barotrauma but only observed in females. Blood indices were most altered 0.5 h after capture, with increased cortisol values for fish that were female, particularly large or captured at deeper depth. Locomotor activity was highest for males and increased with depth. Together, our findings suggest that the effects of catch-and-release angling may be dependent on several factors, including sex, season and angling depth.

Its mountainous upper catchment includes pristine areas as well as a variety of human settlements and a reservoir lake. A large city (Cordoba, ca. 1.3 million inhabitants) and a terminal hypersaline lake are included in the middle and lower basin. Total non-residual (TNR) heavy metals (Pb, Cu, Ni, Zn, Mn, and Fe) have been determined in river bed sediments in two seasons (spring and autumn), seeking to establish the factors which control the temporal and spatial variability. The major findings were: a) concentrations of TNR metals were, in general, higher during springtime than during autumn, particularly downstream from the city of Cordoba; b) organic matter played a significant role as a controlling factor wherever it defined reducing conditions, lowering the concentrations of Mn and Fe hydrous oxides; c) a higher organic load (e.g., downstream the city) and more pronounced reducing conditions could be the causes for the increased Fe concentration, probably precipitated as sulfides; d) organic matter exhibited a closer correlation with some TNR metals in autumn, probably caused by a larger capacity for complexation in the biologically-processed organic debris; and, e) the existence of pristine areas in the drainage basin allowed for the calculation of enrichment factors (EF) which show the significance of several environmental impacts in the Suquia system.

Population of Phytoplankton Dominant in Deep Oligotrophic Lake: Its Size Structure and Role in the Group of Small-Sized Species of Centric Diatoms	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												The paper presents the study (autumn 2021, spring and summer 2022) of small-celled species of centric diatoms (Pantocsekiella teletskoyensis, Stephanodiscus minutulus, S. binatus, and Stephanocostis chantaicus) with a frustule diameter of 3-8 mu m abundant in number in the Lake Teletskoye (Altai, Russia) phytoplankton. Valve diameters of P. teletskoyensis dominated in different seasons and parts of the lake were measured using SEM and divided on groups and statistically valid gradation classes. It allows to evaluate the state of P. teletskoyensis population in different parts of the lake-prosperous or depressive. When grouping the obtained valve sizes of P. teletskoyensis with a step of 1 mu m (3.00-3.99, 4.00-4.99, and 5.00-7.99 mu m), we revealed that in almost all study months and sampling stations frustules of P. teletskoyensis mostly referred to the second size-group and the P. teletskoyensis population characterized as prosperous. At statistical methods application to studying the size structure of populations, distribution by groups was differ. It showed that the state of the study population in phytoplankton in different parts of Lake Teletskoye can be assessed as depressive. In view of this, phytoplankton abundance and biomass (due to small-celled species predominance) in this deep lake are extremely low and correspond to oligotrophic and even ultraoligotrophic levels of water bodies.

J	Widhalm, B; Bartsch, A; Heim, B				Widhalm, Barbara; Bartsch, Annett; Heim, Birgit			A novel approach for the characterization of tundra wetland regions with C-band SAR satellite data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												A circumpolar representative and consistent wetland map is required for a range of applications ranging from upscaling of carbon fluxes and pools to climate modelling and wildlife habitat assessment. Currently available data sets lack sufficient accuracy and/or thematic detail in many regions of the Arctic. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from satellites have already been shown to be suitable for wetland mapping. Envisat Advanced SAR (ASAR) provides global medium-resolution data which are examined with particular focus on spatial wetness patterns in this study. It was found that winter minimum backscatter values as well as their differences to summer minimum values reflect vegetation physiognomy units of certain wetness regimes. Low winter backscatter values are mostly found in areas vegetated by plant communities typically for wet regions in the tundra biome, due to low roughness and low volume scattering caused by the predominant vegetation. Summer to winter difference backscatter values, which in contrast to the winter values depend almost solely on soil moisture content, show expected higher values for wet regions. While the approach using difference values would seem more reasonable in order to delineate wetness patterns considering its direct link to soil moisture, it was found that a classification of winter minimum backscatter values is more applicable in tundra regions due to its better separability into wetness classes. Previous approaches for wetland detection have investigated the impact of liquid water in the soil on backscatter conditions. In this study the absence of liquid water is utilized.Owing to a lack of comparable regional to circumpolar data with respect to thematic detail, a potential wetland map cannot directly be validated; however, one might claim the validity of such a product by comparison with vegetation maps, which hold some information on the wetness status of certain classes. It was shown that the Envisat ASAR-derived classes are related to wetland classes of conventional vegetation maps, indicating its applicability; 30% of the land area north of the treeline was identified as wetland while conventional maps recorded 1-7%.

Here we use a water-balance model12 (to predict catchment runoff ) and a biome model13 (to predict vegetation type) to reconstruct the palaeoenvironment around Lake Ioannina-a type locality for the northern Mediterranean region. We show that both sets of evidence are compatible with a summer-dry, winter-wet regime with seasonal temperature anomalies similar to those predicted by atmospheric model simulations of the Last Glacial Maximum14-18.

J	Raymond, PA; Caraco, NF; Cole, JJ				Raymond, PA; Caraco, NF; Cole, JJ			Carbon dioxide concentration and atmospheric flux in the Hudson River	ESTUARIES												We made direct measurements of the partial pressure of CO2 (P-CO2) in the tidal-freshwater portion of the Hudson River Estuary over a 3.5-yr period. At all times the Hudson was supersaturated in CO2 with respect to the atmosphere. P-CO2 in surface water averaged 1125 +/- 403 (SD) mu atm while the atmosphere averaged 416 +/- 68 mu atm. Weekly samples at a single, mid-river station showed a pronounced and reproducible seasonal cycle with highest values (similar to 2000 mu atm) in mid-to-late summer, and lowest values (similar to 500 mu atm) generally in late winter. Samples taken along the length of the 190-km section of river showed a general decline in CO2 from north to south. This decline was most pronounced in summer and very slight in spring. Diel and vertical variation were small relative to the standing stock of CO2. Over six diel cycles, all taken during the algal growing season, the mean range was 300 +/- 114 mu atm. CO2 tended to increase slightly with depth, but the gradient was small, about 0.5 mu mol m(-1), or an increase of 190 mu atm from top to within 1 m of the bottom. For a large subset of the samples (n = 452) we also calculated CO2 from measurements of pH and total DIC. Calculated and measured values of CO2 were in reasonably good agreement and a regression of calculated versus measured values had a slope of 0.85 +/- 0.04 and an r(2) of 0.60. Combining our measurements with recent experimental studies of gas exchange in the Hudson, we estimate that the Hudson releases CO2 at a rate of 70-162 g C m(-2) yr(-1) from the river to the atmosphere.

This research covers three lakes (Kopa, Zerendinskoye, and Borovoe) and the Yesil River, applying differential equations to model the spatial distribution and seasonal variations in MP concentrations. The methodology integrates field survey data collected during three different seasons (spring, summer, and autumn) from both sediment and water samples. The MP concentrations were found to follow an exponential decay pattern from the shore toward the center of the lakes, with higher concentrations near the shoreline. The modeling framework is calibrated using regression analysis, which provides the best-fit parameters for the distance-concentration curves. This study employs sensitivity analysis to justify the decay coefficient, resulting in a selected value of k = 0.09. Model performance is assessed using statistical metrics such as the root mean square error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination (R2), ensuring accuracy in predicting MP concentrations across different environmental compartments. This work represents a novel contribution to the field by applying numerical modeling techniques to an understudied geographical area. The findings highlight significant seasonal and spatial variations in MP concentrations, emphasizing the need for comprehensive monitoring. This study's results contribute valuable insights into the environmental behavior of MPs in freshwater systems and support efforts to develop effective management strategies to mitigate pollution.

Since the 1970s the conterminous western USA has seen an earlier arrival of spring snowmelt. The extremely low snowpack and early melt of 2015 in the Cascade Mountains may be a harbinger of winters to come, underscoring the interest in advancements in spring snowmelt monitoring. Target-of-opportunity and point measurements of snowmelt using meteorological stations or stream gauges are common sources of these data, however, there have been few attempts to identify snowmelt timing using remote sensing. In this study, we describe the creation of snowmelt timing maps (STMs) which identify the day of year that each pixel of a remotely sensed image transitions from "snow-covered" to "no snow" during the spring melt season, controlling for cloud coverage and ephemeral spring snow storms. Derived from the 500 m MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) standard snow map, MOD10A2, this new dataset provides annual maps of snowmelt timing, with corresponding maps of cloud interference and interannual variability in snow coverage from 2001-2015. We first show that the STMs agree strongly with in-situ snow telemetry (SNOTEL) meteorological station measurements in terms of snowmelt timing. We then use the STMs to investigate the early snowmelt event of 2015 in the Cascade Mountains, USA, highlighting the protected areas of Mt. Rainier, Crater Lake, and Lassen Volcanic National Parks. In 2015 the Cascade Mountains experienced snowmelt 41 days earlier than the 2001-2015 average, with 25% of its land area melting > 65 days earlier than average. The upper elevations of the Cascade Mountains experienced the greatest snowmelt anomaly. Our results are relevant to land managers and biologists as they plan adaptation strategies for mitigating the effects of climate change throughout temperate mountains.

J	Crocker, WC; Zhang, H				Crocker, William C.; Zhang, Hong			Seasonal and Diurnal Variation of Air/Water Exchange of Gaseous Mercury in a Southern Reservoir Lake (Cane Creek Lake, Tennessee, USA)	WATER												A year-long field study of mercury (Hg) air/water exchange was conducted at a southern reservoir lake, Cane Creek Lake (Cookeville, TN, USA). The Hg air/water exchange fluxes and meteorological data including solar radiation (global solar radiation,R(g)and ultraviolent radiation, UVA), water and air temperatures, relative humidity, and wind speed were collected to study the daily and seasonal trends of the Hg air/water exchange at the lake in relation to solar radiation and wind speed. The Hg exchange fluxes generally exhibited diurnal patterns with a rise in the morning, a peak around noontime, and a fall in the afternoon through the evening, closely following the change of solar radiation. There were cases that deviated from this general daily trend. The Hg emission fluxes were all below 3 ng m(-2)h(-1)with the daily mean fluxes < 2 ng m(-2)h(-1). The fluxes in the summer (mean: 1.2 ng m(-2)h(-1)) were higher than in the fall (mean: 0.6 ng m(-2)h(-1)) and winter (mean: 0.7 ng m(-2)h(-1)). The daily and seasonal trends of the Hg air/water exchange fluxes are similar to the trends of the changes of the dissolved gaseous mercury (DGM) concentrations in the lake observed in our previous study. Solar radiation was found to exert a primary control over the Hg air/water exchange, while wind speed appeared to have a secondary effect on the Hg exchange. The two-thin-film model was used to calculate Hg emission fluxes from the Cane Creek Lake water.																				2073-4441				AUG	2020	12	8							2102	10.3390/w12082102	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12082102													WOS:000568012400001
J	Zhu, DN; Ryan, MC; Gao, HB				Zhu, Dongnan; Ryan, M. Cathryn; Gao, Hongbin			The role of water and mass balances in treatment assessment of a flooded natural wetland receiving wastewater effluent (Frank Lake, Alberta, Canada)	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Constructed, and to a lesser extent, natural wetlands are increasingly used to treat treated wastewater effluent from small municipalities and industries. Wetland treatment efficiency evaluation typically involves comparison of solute inflow and outflow concentrations, or estimation of the export of nutrients per unit wetland area. A more holistic approach, which evaluated water and solute mass balances, in addition to seasonal changes in water quality, yielded an improved understanding of where nutrient storage occurred, long-term wetland treatment capabilities, and downstream water quality impacts of a flooded natural wetland receiving waste-water. The lowest solute concentrations in the flooded wetland were observed soon after ephemeral creek flow in the spring, increasing concentrations over the summer attributed to evaporation, and the highest concentrations under winter ice. Chloride accumulation in shoreline sediments was attributed to transpiration pumping, and high salt and phosphorus accumulation in lake and shoreline sediments were a long-term concern at Frank Lake. Limited historic data suggested water quality impacts on the receiving watershed, the Little Bow River, were significant, with about 80, 230, and 20 times increased mass fluxes for chloride, total phosphorus, and total nitrogen, respectively. The flooded wetland, Frank Lake, is not a sustainable approach to wastewater effluent treatment in its current form.

Presumed marine isotope signals have been found in riparian vegetation, suggesting that marine nutrients may impact terrestrial plant communities. Studies have suggested that MDN increases stream productivity both immediately after spawning and during the following spring. The peak of many spawning runs occurs at the end of the summer growing season, suggesting that overwinter storage of MDN must be occurring. A potential location for lateral nutrient transfers and overwinter MDN storage is the hyporheic zone within stream channels or in adjacent riparian floodplains. Within Lynx Creek, a sockeye-spawning stream in the Wood River Lake drainage in southwestern Alaska, extensive flood-plain hyporheic zones occur along spawning reaches. Surface water moves into the floodplain hyporheic zone and flows downstream 70-80 in before returning to the stream. Ambient nutrient concentrations within the surface and hyporheic zone indicate that marine-derived nitrogen and phosphorus entered hyporheic flow paths, where they were rapidly removed from the water during the spawning run. Some marine-derived ammonium was remobilized as nitrate and continued to move, but marine-derived phosphorus was stored for at least the duration of the spawning run. Hyporheic sediments are not scoured by winter floods and contain active heterotrophic biological communities that are capable of storing and transforming various forms of MDN. Thus, it seems likely that hyporheic storage and re-release of marine-derived nutrients is an important mechanism by which salmon-derived nutrients are retained over winter within stream ecosystems and subsequently made available to primary producers the following growing season.																			0892-2284		1-888569-44-1				2003	34						99	107																WOS:000181552500008

Heat Exchange at the Water-Ice Interface and Ice Growth in a Small Boreal Lake	WATER RESOURCES												A new technique has been developed for estimating the thickness of black ice and calculating the heat flux at the water-ice interface. An analysis of data from an autonomous device consisting of three thermistor chains measuring the temperature of black ice, water, and the upper layer of bottom sediments is presented. The device was installed in a small lake during six winter seasons. The vertical temperature distributions were averaged for each day and approximated by smooth functions separately for water and ice. The obtained functions were used to calculate the thickness of black ice, the temperature in the under-ice buffer layer (up to 1.0 m thick) and in the thin laminar water layer adjacent to the ice (from 5 mm to 1-2 cm thick) for each day, and to estimate the heat flux from water to ice. A change in the thickness of the gradient and laminar layers over the lake area and during the winter and spring seasons was revealed. During the first weeks of freeze-up at shallow-water stations, heat fluxes from water to ice were 0.5-1.5 W/m(2) and reached 3 W/m(2) above the deep-water basin in the zone of warm water upwelling. In the deep-water region, the heat flux into ice decreased during the winter as geostrophic circulation weakened and currents that generated warm water upwelling diverged. At shallow-water stations, the heat flux into ice increased during the winter as water temperature increased due to heat influx from bottom sediments. In the spring, as radiation-generated convection developed, the thickness of the subglacial gradient layer decreased in all areas of the lake to 30-50 cm, while the heat flux into ice increased to 8-25 W/m(2).

The sampled fish were bleak (A.scoranza), chub (S.cephalus), common roach (R.rutilus), Ohrid gudgeon (G.ohridanus), Albanian roach (P.pictum), Western Balcan barbell (B.rebeli), European eel (A.anguilla), crucian carp (C.carassius), belvica (A.ohridana), common carp (C.carpio) and Ohrid brown trout (S.letnica). Two population parameters were evaluated for parasites; the indicator of abundance (n individuals/fish) and the species diversity index (D). The highest average value for abundance was calculated for Gyrodactylis sp (Monogenea) (10.8 +/- 7.339 individuals/fish). We found this helminth as an ectoparasite in Ohrid brown trout. We calculated the smallest abundance for Pomphorhynchus laevis (Acanthocephala) (0.41 +/- 0.247 individuals / fish). We found this endoparasite in Western Balcan barbell and Ohrid brown trout. According to the seasons, the average values for the species diversity index (D) of the parasitofauna (parasitic fauna) were: Spring: D = 0.95 +/- 0.021; Summer D = 0.89 +/- 0.029 and Autumn: D = 0.86 +/- 0.007. The D values we calculated for the three seasons were generally high, representing parasitic communities with high diversity.																			2224-4980					MAY-AUG	2021	11	3					477	482		10.31407/ijees11.316	http://dx.doi.org/10.31407/ijees11.316													WOS:000680771100016
J	Clausen, KK; Madsen, J				Clausen, Kevin Kuhlmann; Madsen, Jesper			Philopatry in a changing world: response of pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus to the loss of a key autumn staging area due to restoration of Filso Lake, Denmark	JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												Site fidelity is a strong and widespread feature of many waterfowl species, but little is known about the response of philopatric birds to changing environmental conditions at their preferred staging sites. In this study we analyse the response of pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus to the sudden loss of a major autumn staging area along their migration corridor, Filso in Denmark, which followed the re-establishment of a former lake on open arable land serving as foraging site to tens of thousands of geese. Comparisons of goose usage before and after the restoration event revealed that (1) approximately 80 % of pink-footed geese abandoned this staging area and (2) formerly site-faithful geese moved to other staging areas along the Danish west coast rather than moving further south to the Netherlands. Despite these significant changes in site use, the subsequent spring body condition of birds formerly philopatric to the Filso area was unaffected, suggesting that geese quickly moved to other areas and responded well to the sudden decline in available food at their formerly preferred staging site. These findings indicate that, at least for pink-footed geese, the cognitive plasticity necessary to alter site use allows a swift response to rapidly changing environmental conditions. This may partly be due to the agricultural habitat use of this species, leaving them plenty of alternatives in the modern Danish landscape.

Conditions were warmer and drier during the preceding Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and also in the post-LIA periods, as evidenced by deposition of aragonite. A review of currently existing stalagmite and other proxy data from south and east Asia reveals a broad spatial pattern in precipitation over south and east Asia during the LIA, with northern areas showing generally increased precipitation and southern areas reduced precipitation. During the MCA and after the LIA, the records suggest this pattern was reversed. Weaker ISM during the LIA brought drought conditions to the core ISM area but triggered more monsoon 'breaks' that brought higher precipitation to the Himalayas. At the same time, the weaker ISM may also have pushed more depressions along the path of the southern winter jet which brought more winter precipitation to the Himalayas and therefore a LIA wetter in our study area.

Seasonal Variations in the Structure of an Anoxygenic Phototrophic Bacterial Community from the Meromictic Lake Trekhtsvetnoe (Kandalaksha Bay, White Sea)	MICROBIOLOGY												The community of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria (APB) from the water column of the meromictic Lake Trekhtsvetnoe (Kandalaksha Bay, White Sea, Russia) was studied in March 2012 and 2013 and in September 2013 and 2014. The community structure below the chemocline was shown to restore during three years after partial mixing resulting from seawater admixture into the lake in autumn 2011; a dense layer (at least 10(8) cells mL(-1)) of green-colored (g/c) sulfur bacteria (GSB) was formed. During winter, development of low numbers of brown colored (b/c) GSB was observed in the upper layer of green water. During summer seasons, b/c GSB were found to be located in the oxic zone above the green water layer, which was unusual for these organisms. The APB community was found to contain purple bacteria. Four APB strains were isolated from the upper part of the sulfide zone. The b/c and g/c GSB strains were phylogenetically close to each other and to the type species Chlorobium phaeovibrioides DSM 265 (99% similarity gene sequences). One strain of purple bacteria was phylogenetically related to the brackish sulfur bacteria Thiocapsa marina, while the other was related to freshwater bacteria Rhodopseudomonas palustris. The strains of sulfur bacteria were phylogenetically close to the chemocline bacteria from the stratified Lake Kislo-Sladkoe, also located in the coastal zone of the Kandalaksha Bay, White Sea.

However, little information is available on how the rainfall affect nutrient dynamics in subtropical montane rivers with complex land use. This study conducted high -frequency monitoring to study the effects of rainfall on nutrients dynamics in an agricultural river draining to Lake Qiandaohu, a montane reservoir of southeast China. The results showed that riverine total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations increased continuously with increasing rainfall intensity, while TN:TP decreased. The heavy rainfall and rainstorm drove more than 30% of the annual N and P loading in only 5.20% of the total rainfall period, indicating that increased storm runoff is likely to exacerbate eutrophication in montane reservoirs. NO3- -N is the primary nitrogen form lost, while particulate phosphorus (PP) dominated phosphorus loss. The main source of N is cropland, and the main source of P is residential area. Spatially, forested watersheds have better drainage quality, while it is still a potential source of nonpoint pollution during rainfall events. TN and TP concentrations were significantly higher at sites dominated by cropland and residential area, indicating their substantial contributions to deteriorating river water quality. Temporally, TN and TP concentrations reached high values in May -August when rainfall was most intense, while they were lower in autumn and winter than that in spring and summer under the same rainfall intensities. The results emphasize the influence of rainfall -runoff and land use on dynamics of riverine N and P loads, providing guidance for nutrient load reduction planning for Lake Qiandaohu.

Volcanic carbon cycling in East Lake, Newberry Volcano, Oregon, USA	GEOLOGY												Lake is a drowned crater with visual evidence of CO2 inputs from the lake bottom (Lefkowitz et al., 2017). The CO2 bubbles carry traces of H2S and Hg gas but almost no fluids. A bubbly CO2-Hg-H2S "hotspot" is found along the southeastern beach (Fig. 1). East Lake has no inlets or outlets, a maximum water depth of 55 m, and a 4.2 km2 surface area. It is frozen in winter and thermally stratified in summer (Lefkowitz et al., 2017). This study aims to determine the magnitude of the volcanic CO2 input in this carbonate-rich volcanic lake based on 5 years of flux measurements and to map the local carbon cycle based on carbon isotope evidence. The carbon cycle in East Lake (Newberry Volcano, Oregon, USA) is fueled by volcanic CO2 inputs with traces of Hg and H2S. The CO2 dissolves in deep lake waters and is removed in shallow waters through largely diffusive surface degassing and photosynthesis. Escaping gas and photosynthate have low 813C values, leading to 813C(DIC) (DIC-dissolved inorganic carbon) as high as +5.7 parts per thousand in surface waters, well above the common global lake range. A steep 813C depth gradient is further established by respiration and absorption of light volcanic CO2 in bottom waters. The seasonal CO2 degassing starts at >100 t CO2/day after ice melting in the spring and declines to -40 t/day in late summer, degassing -11,700 t CO2/yr. Thus, volcano monitoring through gas fluxes from crater lakes should consider lacustrine processes that modulate the volcanic gas output over time. The flux contribution of a bubbling CO2 "hotspot" increased from 20% to >90% of the lake-wide CO2 flux from 2015 to 2019 CE, followed by a "toxic gas alert" in July 2020. East Lake is an active volcanic lake with a "geogenic" ecosystem driven primarily by hydrothermal inputs.

J	RIESSEN, HP				RIESSEN, HP			EXPLOITATION OF PREY SEASONALITY BY A PLANKTONIC PREDATOR	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The timing of the life history of the pelagic water mite Piona constricta in Heney Lake, Quebec [Canada], allows this species to exploit the seasonality of its two most important prey, Bosmina longirostris and Chydorus sphaericus. The spring emergence of P. constricta adults coincides with a large maximum of Bosmina, while the summer maximum of P. constricta nymphs largely coincides with a "bloom" of Chydorus in the plankton. The spring ice melt appears to be an important event, initiating the seasonal dynamics of the various species and indirectly linking the life history of the predatory water mite to the seasonal population maxima of its prey. The unusual success of this water mite in the plankton community of Heney Lake appears to be largely due to its ability to fully exploit predictable prey seasonality.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1985	63	7					1729	1732		10.1139/z85-259	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z85-259													WOS:A1985APF8500034

Here we investigated chronologies of earlywood, latewood, and annual ring widths and blue intensity (BI; a surrogate to latewood density) from riparian lake shore and upland forest interior pines (Pinus sylvestris L.) growing in boreal forest in eastern Finland. Riparian and upland chronologies were compared to examine differences in the pine growth variability and growth response to climatic variation in the two habitats. It was found that the climatic variables showing statistically significant correlations with the tree-ring chronologies were related to snow conditions at the start of the growing season. Deeper snowpack led to reduced upland pine growth, possibly due to delayed snowmelt and thus postponed onset of the growing season. Warm late winters were followed by increased riparian pine growth because of earlier start of the snow-melt season and thus a lower maximum early summer lake level. Moreover, riparian pines reacted negatively to increased rainfall in June, whereas the upland pines showed a positive response. Latewood growth reacted significantly to summer temperatures. The BI chronology showed a strong correlation with warm-season temperatures, indicating an encouraging possibility of summer temperature reconstruction using middle/south boreal pine tree-ring archives.

Temporal variation and assessment of trophic state indicators in Missouri reservoirs: Implication for lake monitoring and management	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												The magnitude and management implications of temporal variability in trophic state metrics was simulated by measuring mean values of total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), chlorophyll (Ch1) and Secchi depth (SD) in summer (May-August) and detecting trends in these variables in a virtual lake undergoing gradual (doubling over 20 years) and abrupt (doubling over two years) change. Numbers of samples required (samples per summer over number of summers) to adequately detect these rates of change were used to show the size and management implications of temporal variability. Long-term data from 116 Missouri reservoirs, including eight summer data sets based on daily sampling, provided estimates of autocorrelation and variation within and among summers (seasonal and year-to-year variance) used in Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate sampling requirements. In simulations based on median variance, obtaining long-term means with 95% confidence intervals spanning less than a factor of two took from three years (TN) to eight years (Ch1) with monthly samples (n=3 per summer). For a lake with mean values doubling every 20 years, linear regression had > 75% chance of detecting the trend after 13 years of monthly samples for TN, but Ch1 required > 20 years. For a lake with Ch1 doubling over two years, at least six years of pre-change data and 11 years of post-change data were required before monthly sampling gave > 75% probability of detecting the trend. Increasing sampling to weekly frequency (n=16 per summer) in most scenarios reduced required duration of sampling by < 2 years. Variability data from lakes in other regions fall in the range exhibited by Missouri reservoirs. Results emphasize the need for long-term data to fulfill lake management needs and suggest that ordinary lake monitoring typically will not detect trends in individual lakes.

We drew a conclusion that the benthic algal flora was affected from organically polluted of the lake.																			1300-1590	2148-3140					2006	23	3-4					307	313																WOS:000440354200011

Dissolved organic carbon concentrations and fluxes in forest catchments and streams: DOC-3 model	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING					Conference of the International-Society-for-Ecological-Modelling	OCT 06-09, 2009	Quebec City, CANADA	Int Soc Ecolog Modelling				Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in south-western Nova Scotia streams, sampled at weekly to biweekly intervals, varied across streams from about 3 to 40 mg L-1, being highest mid-summer to fall, and lowest during winter to spring. A 3-parameter model (DOC-3) was proposed to project daily stream DOC concentrations and fluxes from modelled estimates for daily soil temperature and moisture, year-round, and in relation to basin size and wetness. The parameters of this model refer to (i) a basin-specific DOC release parameter "k(DOC)", related to the wet- and open-water area percentages per basin, (ii) the lag time "tau" between DOC production and subsequent stream DOC emergence, related to the catchment area above the stream sampling location; and (iii) the activation energy "Ea", to deal with the temperature effect on DOC production. This model was calibrated with the 1988-2006 DOC concentration data from three streams (Pine Marten, Moosepit Brook, and the Mersey River sampled at or near Kejimkujik National Park, or KNP), and was used to interpret the biweekly 1999-2003 DOC concentrations data (stream, ground and lake water, soil lysimeters) of the Pockwock-Bowater Watershed Project near Halifax, Nova Scotia. The data and the model revealed that the DOC concentrations within the streams were not correlated to the DOC concentrations within the soil- and groundwater, but were predictable based on (i) the hydrologically inferred weather-induced changes in soil moisture and temperature next to each stream, and (ii) the topographically inferred basin area and wet- and open-water area percentages associated with each stream (R-2 = 0.53; RMSE = 3.5 mg L-1). Model-predicted fluxes accounted 74% of the hydrometrically determined DOC exports at KNP. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Saidi, H; Koschorreck, M				Saidi, Helmi; Koschorreck, Matthias			CO2 emissions from German drinking water reservoirs	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Globally, reservoirs are a significant source of atmospheric CO2. However, precise quantification of greenhouse gas emissions from drinking water reservoirs on the regional or national scale is still challenging. We calculated CO2 fluxes for 39 German drinking water reservoirs during a period of 22 years (1991-2013) using routine monitoring data in order to quantify total emission of CO2 from drinking water reservoirs in Germany and to identify major drivers. All reservoirs were a net CO2 source with a median flux of 167 g C m(-2) y(-1), which makes gaseous emissions a relevant process for the carbon budget of each reservoir. Fluxes varied seasonally with median fluxes of 13, 48, and 201 g C m(-2) y(-1) in spring, summer, and autumn respectively. Differences between reservoirs appeared to be primarily caused by the concentration of CO2 in the surface water rather than by the physical gas transfer coefficient. Consideration of short term fluctuations of the gas transfer coefficient due to varying wind speed had only a minor effect on the annual budgets. High CO2 emissions only occurred in reservoirs with pH < 7 and total alkalinity <0.2 mEq l(-1). Annual CO2 emissions correlated exponentially with pH but not with dissolved organic carbon (DOC). There was significant correlation between land use in the catchment and CO2 emissions. In total, German drinking water reservoirs emit 44000 t of CO2 annually, which makes them a negligible CO2 source (<0.005% of national CO2 emissions) in Germany. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Knowlton, MF; Jones, JR				Knowlton, MF; Jones, JR			Seston, light, nutrients and chlorophyll in the lower Missouri River, 1994-1998	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												We collected data for five years from the lower Missouri River including discharge (819-10032 m(3) s(-1)), mean depth (2.7-9.3 m), underwater irradiance (0.1-3.7 fin m(-2) d(-1)), suspended solids (19-2340 mg L-I), total phosphorus (131-1810 mu g L-1), total nitrogen (0.9-4.2 mg L-1), nitrate-N (380-3050 mu g L-1), silica (8.2-16.8 mg L-1) and chlorophyll (4.5-107 mu g L-1). Suspended solids, phosphorus and light attenuation varied directly with discharge. Nitrate, ammonium-N, silica and chlorophyll were strongly seasonal. Chlorophyll was temperature dependent exhibiting winter minima (<8 mu g L-1) and spring and fall maxima (>40 mu g L-1). In the growing season, chlorophyll co-varied with light and varied inversely with silica and dissolved P. Poor light conditions (mixed depth:photic depth >10) and rapid flow rates (approximate to 150 km d(-1)) suggest that in situ production of algae is less important than flux of biomass from upstream. Chlorophyll flux and pheophytin increased with discharge indicating contributions of benthic or terrestrial inputs. About a fourth of the particulate organic nitrogen transported by the river may be autochthonous. Algal uptake may reduce silica flux by >22%.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				SEP	2000	15	3					283	297		10.1080/02705060.2000.9663747	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2000.9663747													WOS:000088709800001

We hypothesized that the onset of darkness induces changes in the functional role of autotrophic and heterotrophic microplankton. Bacteria decreased in Lake Hoare during MarchApril, while in Lake Bonney bacterial abundances varied. Heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNAN), phototrophic nanoflagellates (PNAN) and ciliates showed no marked decline with the onset of winter. PNAN outnumbered HNAN in both lakes. Grazing rates of HNAN in Lake Hoare ranged up to 30.8bacteriapercellday-1. The HNAN community grazed between 3.74 and 36.6ng of bacterialcarbonday-1. Mixotrophic PNAN had grazing rates up to 15.2bacteriapercellday-1, and their daily community grazing exceeded bacterial production. In Lake Bonney East, PNAN grazing rates ranged up to 12.48bacteriapercellday-1 and in Lake Bonney West up to 8.16bacteriapercellday-1. As in Lake Hoare, the mixotrophic PNAN grazing rates (up to 950ngCday-1) usually exceeded bacterial production. HNAN grazing rates were generally similar to those in Lake Hoare. As winter encroaches, these lakes move progressively towards heterotrophy and probably function during the winter, enabling populations to enter the short austral summer with actively growing populations.					; hill, phil/AAQ-1081-2020; Vick-Majors, Trista/AAQ-6258-2020	Hill, Philip/0000-0002-2250-1397; Parry, Jacqueline Dawn/0000-0001-6950-0706; Vick-Majors, Trista/0000-0002-6868-4010; 													0168-6496	1574-6941				NOV	2012	82	2					449	458		10.1111/j.1574-6941.2012.01423.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2012.01423.x								22671290					WOS:000310261900019

Ranga			Spit and Inlet Morphodynamics of a Tropical Coastal Lagoon	MARINE GEODESY												The morphological changes of spits and inlets of the Chilika lagoon, the largest brackish water tropical coastal lagoon in Asia, are investigated using real-time kinematic GPS observation and numerical models during 2009-2013. The seasonal/interannual variations of the spit and inlet cross-sectional areas with varying widths and depths are recorded in association with different physical processes. The results show significant changes in spit morphology: particularly, the south spit accreted continuously, while the middle and north spits eroded. The cross-sectional depth of inlets becomes narrower and deeper during summer and winter seasons, while they are wider and shallower during the monsoon. The model results show that sediment transport rate is larger during monsoon and summer, while it is relatively less during the winter. Alongshore, sediment transport is predominantly northward throughout the study period. The result shows that gain/loss of the spits and closure/opening of inlets are significantly controlled by the high wave power, longshore drifts, and river discharge. The study demonstrates that the combined use of observational and numerical models is very effective to understand the changes of spit and inlet morphology and their impact on ecological conditions of the lagoon environment.

J	Xiao, HY; Liu, CQ				Xiao, HY; Liu, CQ			Discrimination between extraneous nitrogen input and interior nitrogen release in lakes	SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES D-EARTH SCIENCES												In this study the authors determined the nitrogen isotopes of nitrate and the carbon and nitrogen contents of water samples from the Hongfeng Lake and inflowing streams, and, on this basis, discriminated the extraneous nitrogen input and the interior nitrogen release (organic matter decomposition) in the lake. The results showed that the amount of extraneous nitrogen input into the Hongfeng Lake increases and the interior nitrogen release from the lake is intensified in winter and spring. Nitrogen mixing is relatively obvious at the catchments between the lake inlet and inflowing streams, while organic matter decomposition (nitrification) is most intense in the middle and lower reaches of the lake. In winter and spring the organic matter decomposition takes place mainly at the middle level of the water column in the middle and lower reaches of the lake, which has a bearing on the abundance of degraded organic matter at this water level. This part of degraded organic matter contains a considerable proportion of hydrogenous nitrogen in the lake.

J	Heikkilä, M; Seppä, H				Heikkila, Maija; Seppa, Heikki			Holocene climate dynamics in Latvia, eastern Baltic region: a pollen-based summer temperature reconstruction and regional comparison	BOREAS												A pollen-based summer temperature (T-summer) reconstruction reveals the Holocene climate history in southeastern Latvia and contributes to the limited understanding of past climate behaviour in the eastern sector of northern Europe. Notably, steady climate warming of the early Holocene was interrupted c. 8350-8150 cal. yr BP by the well-known 8.2 ka cold event, recorded as a decrease of 0.9 to 1.8 degrees C in T-summer. During the Holocene Thermal Maximum, c. 8000-4000 cal. yr BP, the reconstructed summer temperature was similar to 2.5-3.5 degrees C higher than the modern reconstructed value, and subsequently declined towards present-day values. Comparison of the current reconstruction with other pollen-based reconstructions in northern Europe shows that the 8.2 ka event is particularly clearly reflected in the Baltic region, possibly as a result of distinct climatic and ecological gradients and the sensitivity of the vegetation growth pattern to seasonal temperature change. The new reconstruction also reveals that the Holocene Thermal Maximum was warmer in Latvia than in central Europe and Fennoscandia. In fact, a gradient of increasing positive temperature anomalies is detected from northernmost Fennoscandia towards the south and from the Atlantic coast in Norway towards the continental East European Plain. The dynamics of the temperate broadleaved tree species Tilia and Quercus in Latvia and adjacent northern Europe during the mid-Holocene give complementary information on the multifaceted climatic and environmental changes in the region.

While avian trichomonads are relatively often studied in this context, infection with acanthamoebae was only reported in a few terrestrial bird species. Taken together, the epidemiological role of wetland-associated bird species has been infrequently examined simultaneously for the presence of both groups of the above protozoan parasites. This study was initiated in the southern part of Central Europe, Hungary, to assess the role of waterfowl as carriers of trichomonads and acanthamoebae, involving 189 birds of 21 species from five avian orders sampled across three seasons (autumn, winter, spring). From these birds, cloacal swabs were collected and analyzed with molecular methods. Tetratrichomonas gallinarum (represented by three genetic variants) was detected in two synanthropic bird species, the Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and the Mute Swan (Cygnus olor), as well as a new Tetratrichomonas sp. in Ruffs (Calidris pugnax) and a Simplicimonas sp. in a Mallard. In addition, five Acanthamoeba spp., representing genogroups T4, T2, and T13, were demonstrated from Mute Swans and a Mallard exclusively in the autumn. Identical genotypes of trichomonads were only found in the same host species, even in multiple cases, while all five detected Acanthamoeba variants were represented by a single genotype per host, all of which occurred at the same location. These molecular data suggest that synanthropic waterfowl may harbor a broad spectrum of hind gut trichomonads and acanthamoebae, some of which may contaminate the environment and can be potentially acquired by domestic poultry and other vertebrates living nearby. Findings of the present study support that natural water surfaces and swimming may also entail infection with non-thermophilic opportunistic amoebae, and waterfowl should be added to the potential sources of such cases. This is particularly relevant to places where pastures are flooded with lake water.																			0932-0113	1432-1955				JUL 2	2025	124	7							76	10.1007/s00436-025-08522-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-025-08522-z								40601037					WOS:001536525400001

Rosenbaum, JG; Kaufman, DS		Climatic and limnologic setting of Bear Lake, Utah and Idaho	PALEOENVIRONMENTS OF BEAR LAKE, UTAH AND IDAHO, AND ITS CATCHMENT	Geological Society of America Special Papers											Bear Lake is a large alkaline lake on a high plateau on the Utah-Idaho border. The Bear River was partly diverted into the lake in the early twentieth century so that Bear Lake could serve as a reservoir to supply water for hydropower and irrigation downstream, which continues today. The northern Rocky Mountain region is within the belt of the strongest of the westerly winds that transport moisture during the winter and spring over coastal mountain ranges and into the Great Basin and Rocky Mountains. As a result of this dominant winter precipitation pattern, most of the water entering the lake is from snowmelt, but with net evaporation. The dominant solutes in the lake water are Ca(2+), Mg(2+), and HCO(3)(2-), derived from Paleozoic carbonate rocks in the Bear River Range west of the lake. The lake is saturated with calcite, aragonite, and dolomite at all depths, and produces vast amounts of carbonate minerals. The chemistry of the lake has changed considerably over the past 100 years as a result of the diversion of Bear River. The net effect of the diversion was to dilute the lake water, especially the Mg(2+) concentration. Bear Lake is oligotrophic and coprecipitation of phosphate with CaCO(3) helps to keep productivity low. However, algal growth is colimited by nitrogen availability. Phytoplankton densities are low, with a mean summer chlorophyll a concentration of 0.4 mg L(-1). Phytoplankton are dominated by diatoms, but they have not been studied extensively ( but see Moser and Kimball, this volume). Zooplankton densities usually are low (<10 L(-1)) and highly seasonal, dominated by calanoid copepods and cladocera. Benthic invertebrate densities are extremely low; chironomid larvae are dominant at depths <30 m, and are partially replaced with ostracodes and oligochaetes in deeper water. The ostracode species in water depths >10 m are all endemic. Bear Lake has 13 species of fish, four of which are endemic.

Pelagic fish densities were less than 70/ha with an average size of approximately 13 cm; densities of benthic fishes, most likely catfishes (Ictalurus spp.), were much higher, approximately 600/ha. Fish densities encountered in May were nearly 2 orders of magnitude less than either those reported in 32 years of fall rotenone surveys or in fall hydroacoustic surveys in upstream reservoirs. Confirmation of these low fish densities will require expanding sampling efforts. If validated, our findings may suggest a seasonal pelagic prey shortage, indicating a need for maximizing anadromous fish passage and close scrutiny of management activities including aquatic vegetation control, harvest restrictions, and stocking.																									1994							464	473																WOS:A1994BJ69M00056

Biology of the Grey heron Ardea cinerea Linnaeus, 1758 and its role in biocenoses in the south of the taiga zone of Western Siberia (Tomsk region, Russia)	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA												In recent years, the Grey heron Ardea cinerea has been expanding its range in the south of the taiga zone of Western Siberia. In the Tomsk region during the XX-XXI centuries, it went from being a rare vagrant to a nesting species. The Grey heron is included in the regional Red Book as a rare species with insufficiently studied biology. Interest in it is also associated with its biocenotic role- the impact on soils and vegetation. It can also be an indicator of climate change, since its expansion to the north coincides with the trend of climate warming in Western Siberia. The aim of this work was to study the biology of the Grey heron in the south of the taiga zone of Western Siberia- migration, seasonal dynamics, nesting biology, biocenotic role in ecosystems. Observations of migration and seasonal dynamics were carried out from 1998 to 2023. In spring we used the method of daily 2-hour morning observations in April-May. In summer and autumn (from July to October) we carried out route-area counting of birds in the same place with a frequency of once every 5-7 days. A total we have 15 seasons in spring and 8 in summer-autumn. The main observation area was located in the vicinity of the village of Kolarovo (56 degrees 19'47.29'' N, 84 degrees 56'49.61'' E) on the Tom River (right tributary of the Ob River) 15 km south of Tomsk. Additionally, in 2002-2003, observations were conducted on the Ob River in the southern (Kozhevnikovo District), middle (Kolpashevo District) and northern (Aleksandrovo District) parts of Tomsk region. The southern points (Tomsk and Kozhevnikovo districts) corresponded to the sub- taiga zone, the middle and northern points corresponded to the southern and middle taiga of Western Siberia, respectively. Nesting biology was studied at a Heron colony discovered on an island near the village of Kolarovo. We counted nests, colony structure, and clutch size (based on the eggs shells under the nests). Since some of the trees in the colony were dried out and dead, which is associated with herons, we assessed and compared the & rcy;H and chemical composition of the soils (phosphorus content, exchangeable bases etc.) under different trees in the colony (See Fig.1)- long-used (dead), still alive and outside the colony (control area). The study showed that the arrival dates over the past 25 years have shifted by about 2 weeks towards an earlier appearance- from April 25 in the 2000s to April 5 in the 2020s (See Table 1). The trend is confirmed by the Kendall correlation (0.61; p < 0.05). One of the reasons for this is climate warming, another is the formation of a large colony, to which the birds tend to return as quickly as possible, whereas at the beginning of the observations the colony was just appearing. It was also shown that the density of birds on the lakes during feeding in spring increased by 3-10 times compared to the early 2000s (See Table 1). The number of nests in the identified colony was 81. They were located on 54 trees, mainly on bird cherry trees. There was 1 nest on 38 trees, 2 on 9 trees, 3 trees had 3 nests, and 4 on 4 trees. The average distance between nests was 4.28 +/- 0.48 meter (from 0.5 to 9.7 m). The height of the nests above the ground was 7,26 +/- 0.2 m. Chicks hatched in late May- early June. Clutch size was 3,91 +/- 0.13 (n = 23). We found a badger Meles leucurus settlement under the colony on the island. The conditions here were favorable for it due to the possibility of eating fish that fell during feeding and probably chicks (we found heron bones). During the inspection of the colony, we found dace Leuciscus baicalensis and perch Perca fluviatilis. It was also shown that the excretory activity of herons negatively affects the properties of the soil, leading to its acidification and the death of the trees on which the nests are located. Compared to the control area (out of colony), the phosphorus content in the upper horizons of the soil under the nests is 3.5 times higher. The acidity indicators differed between the background and the control by 1.5 times. Under the nests 4.3 and in the control- 6.1 units, respectively (See Table 2). Despite the negative impact, the problem is local in nature and does not cause significant damage. The article contains 2 Figures, 2 Tables and 35 References.

The isolation of Pythium species was achieved by zoospores baiting technique (ZBT), direct isolation from soil (DIS) and soil serial dilution method (SSDM) using a selective agar medium (NARM). Pythium species were identified morphologically and sequencing of rDNA-ITS of the isolated species including the 5.8 S rDNA were analyzed to confirm the species identification. A total of 746 isolates were identified into 11 species: P. aphanidermatum, P. aquatile, P. catenulatum, P. deliense, P. diclinum, P. graminicola, P. irregulare, P. myriotylum, P. oligandrum, P. spinosum, P. ultimum var. ultimum and representatives of three heterothallic Pythium groups F, G and P. The most predominant species in all location was P. aphanidermatum fallowed by P. ultimum var. ultimum and P. diclinum. While P. graminicola was the lowest predominant species. Spread of Pythium species fluctuated seasonally and maximum number of isolates were recorded in spring fallowed by winter and least isolated could be found in summer.The study gives an overview of population status of Pythium species and possible crop infestation as well as its potential as biological control measure.

J	Goedkoop, W; Johnson, RK				Goedkoop, W; Johnson, RK			Factors affecting population fluctuations of the glacial relict amphipod Monoporeia affinis (Lindstrom) in Sweden's largest lakes	AMBIO												Factors affecting long-term (1982-2000) population densities of the glacial relict amphipod Monoporeia affinis were studied in Sweden's three largest lakes. Monoporeia showed large population fluctuations in all three lakes, with conspicuous peaks in density occurring in Lakes Vanern and Malaren. In Lake Vanern, amphipod densities showed highly significant relationships with spring maximum diatom biovolume at a 1-yr lag. The lack of relationship between diatom biovolumes and Monoporeia densities in L. Vattern is likely due to the larger depth and the lower nutrient content of this lake. In eutrophic L. Malaren, summer hypoxia (<4 Mg O-2 L-1) is likely an important regulating factor. Hypolimnetic temperature showed a clear periodicity with relatively warm deep water occurring between 1989 and 1994. Hypolimnetic temperatures in Vanern and Vattern were correlated with total solar irradiance. However, neither hypolimnetic water temperature nor diatom biovolumes correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation winter index. We speculate that variations in temperature and near-bottom oxygen concentrations negatively affect population densities by acting on recruitment success (reproduction) and juvenile (young-of-the-year) survival.

J	GERKING, SD				GERKING, SD			PRODUCTION AND FOOD UTILIZATION IN A POPULATION OF BLUEGILL SUNFISH	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												The objective of this study was to describe the relationship between a bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) population and its food supply. Wyland Lake, Kosciusko Co., Indiana, was the site of the investigation. It is a miniature eutrophic lake of 3.18 ha with a maximum depth of 6 m characterized by thermal and chemical stratification throughout the summer. Simultaneous measurements were made in 1955 and 1956 of the abundance, growth rates, and mortality rates of the fish population, the kinds of organisms consumed as food, and the quantity of benthos and entomostraca. Vital statistics of the fish population were estimated by mark-and-recapture procedures. The kinds and relative abundance of organisms consumed were determined by examining fish stomachs. The abundance of entomostraca was measured by a Birge plankton trap, and the quantity of benthos was measured by a randomly stratified sampling technique. The food turnover of the bluegills was estimated from the vital statistics and the results of laboratory feeding experiments on the efficiency of protein utilization for growth. The fish population was large, grew slowly, and had a high natural mortality rate. Disease and parasitism were probably primary causes of death, since the population was overcrowded and undernourished, and parasitic infection appeared to be severe. The bottom fauna decreased by nearly 1/2 from July to August of each year. The decline was either caused by or accentuated by predation by the fish. Daphnia suffered a catastrophic mortality during the summer but feeding by the fish was not enough to account for the change. Bluegill production was calculated from the vital statistics, and minimum benthic production was estimated by comparing the July-August decline with the monthly food turnover. The trophic level production efficiency was about 0.20. Tissue growth efficiency of the bluegills was 0.15. The ecotrophic coefficient for benthos and for midge larvae was about 0.50. Fish production occurs during the 5 summer months, but food production is on a 12-month schedule. Summer is a "keep-up" period when food production attempts to keep up with the losses by fish predation and other sources of mortality. Late fall and winter is the "catch-up" period when the growth of a new generation has an opportunity to counterbalance the summer losses.																			0012-9615	1557-7015					1962	32	1					31	+		10.2307/1942360	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1942360													WOS:A19621165B00001

To that end, mean annual soil temperature (MAST) data for Wisconsin and Michigan were modeled to (i) determine the effects of the Great Lakes and their snowbelts on soil temperatures, and (ii) better estimate the location of the boundary between the mesic and frigid soil temperature regimes in this region. The location of the mesic-frigid (M-F) line is particularly difficult to determine where east-west gradients in air temperature cross north-south trends in snowfall due to Lake Michigan. Additionally, the soil temperature regime of several Great Lakes' peninsulas near the M-F line is in question. To determine the accuracy of our soil temperature model, soil temperature data output from it were compared with data derived from thermocouples implanted in soils at 39 sites in northern Michigan that had been collecting data several times daily for more than 6 yr. Error statistics for the model show that it has essentially no mean bias when examined on an annual basis or for winter, and only a bias of 0.1 degrees C for the warm season. The M-F line in Wisconsin and Michigan is slightly north of most previously estimated locations, and is strongly influenced by the snowbelt in southern Michigan. Soils in deep snow areas stay warmer in winter than do soils inland, increasing their MAST and forcing the M-F line north of where air temperatures alone might have placed it. Lake-effect areas also stay cold longer into the spring season, and cool down more slowly in fall. Soil temperatures in these areas are, therefore, more moderated on an annual basis, as indicated by coefficients of variation.																			0361-5995	1435-0661				NOV-DEC	2005	69	6					2033	2040		10.2136/sssaj2004.0349	http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2004.0349													WOS:000233223500038

Once a TMDL is established, a watershed management plan is developed and implemented to reduce contaminant sources and attain TMDL goals. Developing an effective TMDL and remediation plan should take into account fluctuation of pollution loadings and the timing of first-flush events. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of hydrological conditions on microbial pollutant levels at a TMDL site during spring and summer storm events. A total of 64 water samples were collected from Sloan Creek in mid-Michigan in the spring/summer of 2015. All samples were analyzed to quantify concentrations of E. coli, bovine-associated Bacteroides (BoBac) gene markers, and human-associated Bacteroides (HuBac) gene markers. Discharge was the driving force of microbial contaminant loading in the studied water body. E. coil concentrations had significant strong correlation with precipitation and discharge, and BoBac concentrations were positively related to discharge. E. coil, BoBac and HuBac patterns suggested first-flush phenomena occurred during summer storms. E. coli permit exceedance rates increased from 31% before first-flush, to 100% during and after first-flush in the summer. The resulting information may help develop a plan for restoring impaired waters and establish the maximum amount of pollutants that the body of water can receive during different hydrological conditions.

Lake thermal structure drives interannual variability in summer anoxia dynamics in a eutrophic lake over 37 years	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The concentration of oxygen is fundamental to lake water quality and ecosystem functioning through its control over habitat availability for organisms, redox reactions, and recycling of organic material. In many eutrophic lakes, oxygen depletion in the bottom layer (hypolimnion) occurs annually during summer stratification. The temporal and spatial extent of summer hypolimnetic anoxia is determined by interactions between the lake and its external drivers (e.g., catchment characteristics, nutrient loads, meteorology) as well as internal feedback mechanisms (e.g., organic matter recycling, phytoplankton blooms). How these drivers interact to control the evolution of lake anoxia over decadal timescales will determine, in part, the future lake water quality. In this study, we used a vertical one-dimensional hydrodynamic-ecological model (GLM-AED2) coupled with a calibrated hydrological catchment model (PIHM-Lake) to simulate the thermal and water quality dynamics of the eutrophic Lake Mendota (USA) over a 37 year period. The calibration and validation of the lake model consisted of a global sensitivity evaluation as well as the application of an optimization algorithm to improve the fit between observed and simulated data. We calculated stability indices (Schmidt stability, Birgean work, stored internal heat), identified spring mixing and summer stratification periods, and quantified the energy required for stratification and mixing. To qualify which external and internal factors were most important in driving the interannual variation in summer anoxia, we applied a random-forest classifier and multiple linear regressions to modeled ecosystem variables (e.g., stratification onset and offset, ice duration, gross primary production). Lake Mendota exhibited prolonged hypolimnetic anoxia each summer, lasting between 50-60 d. The summer heat budget, the timing of thermal stratification, and the gross primary production in the epilimnion prior to summer stratification were the most important predictors of the spatial and temporal extent of summer anoxia periods in Lake Mendota. Interannual variability in anoxia was largely driven by physical factors: earlier onset of thermal stratification in combination with a higher vertical stability strongly affected the duration and spatial extent of summer anoxia. A measured step change upward in summer anoxia in 2010 was unexplained by the GLM-AED2 model. Although the cause remains unknown, possible factors include invasion by the predacious zooplankton Bythotrephes longimanus. As the heat budget depended primarily on external meteorological conditions, the spatial and temporal extent of summer anoxia in Lake Mendota is likely to increase in the near future as a result of projected climate change in the region.

Declining body condition of northern pintails wintering in the Playa Lakes Region	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Overwinter body condition (e.g., fat) provides an index to the health of northern pintail (Anas acuta) populations and may be a factor in the decline of the continental pintail population that has been previously overlooked or understated. We compared body condition between 1984-1985 and 2002-2003, and found that body condition of pintails arriving during early winter in the Playa Lakes Region (PLR) of Texas, USA, has declined by an average of 32%. Body fat levels declined at varying levels with juvenile males showing the largest decline of 41%, followed by adult females with 39%, juvenile females with 30%, and adult males with an overall 18% decline. Declines are likely related to declines in migration and wintering habitat quantity and quality within the PLR and potentially across the Central Flyway. We recommend further acquisition and management of playas to ensure that these valuable habitats remain available to provide critical habitats for migrating and wintering pintails and other waterfowl in the Central Flyway.																			0022-541X					FEB	2007	71	1					218	221		10.2193/2005-596	http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/2005-596													WOS:000245666800028

Rinsing of Saline Water from Road Salt in a Sandy Soil by Infiltrating Rainfall: Experiments, Simulations, and Implications	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Saline melt water from road salt applications that has percolated into a fine sandy soil in winter is rinsed out of the soil by infiltrating rainwater in the following warmer seasons. This sequence of saturated and unsaturated flow processes associated with saline water transport in a fine sandy soil was studied by simulation and exploratory laboratory experiments. Experiments in soil columns of 300-mu m sand revealed that two rinses of pure water, each of one pore volume, were sufficient to reduce the salt concentration by 99% of its original value in the soil column. Simulated time variations of salt concentration in the effluent from the column agreed with experimental results. Based on simulated and experimental results, a sandy soil must become saturated to experience pore water flow in order to efficiently rinse saline snowmelt water. Depending on the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the soil depth, days, weeks, or months of freshwater infiltration in summer are needed to rinse saline melt water from an unsaturated sandy soil after road salt applications in winter. This explains findings of significant salt concentrations in surface and shallow groundwater during summer months, long after road salt application and infiltration has ceased.

In this study, river-lake water samples in the Ebinur Lake Basin of the arid climate zone of NW-China were taken on May, August, and October 2021, to analyze the seasonal evaporation process and mechanism using delta H-2 and delta O-18 as proxies. The results showed that the mean delta H-2 and delta O-18 values of river water were - 83.1 parts per thousand and - 11.84 parts per thousand in May, -76.0 parts per thousand and - 10.85 parts per thousand in August, and - 89.4 parts per thousand and - 12.78 parts per thousand in October; and that of the lake water were - 24.7 parts per thousand and - 1.54 parts per thousand in May, -18.5 parts per thousand and - 0.08 parts per thousand in August, -27.8 parts per thousand and - 2.21 parts per thousand in October. This showed enrichment of delta H-2 and delta O-18 in summer, depletion in winter, and intermediate during spring and autumn. The water evaporation ratios of May, August, and October were 53.0%, 56.6%, 51.2% for Ebinur Lake; 13.5%, 20.3%, 6.7% for the Kuitun River; 8.8%, 14.5%, 6.2% for the Bortala River; 6.2%, 10.0%, 3.3% for the Jinghe River. And the water evaporation ratios were, in descending order, the Ebinur Lake, Kuitun River, Bortala River, and Jinghe River. Spatial analysis showed that the water evaporation ratio from the Bortala River increased from 4.4% upstream to 12.7% downstream and that of the Jinghe River increased from 6.0% upstream to 9.2% downstream. The evaporation ratio of the basin showed a strong positive correlation with temperature (R = 0.94), a weak positive correlation with precipitation (R = 0.56), a strong negative correlation with humidity (R=-0.94), a strong negative correlation with altitude (R=-0.61), and a strong sensitivity to the composition of delta 2H and delta 18O in the water body. The study using delta 2H and delta 18O as proxies can effectively reveal a seasonal model of water evaporation in the arid Ebinur Lake Basin, shedding lights on analogues in the world.

Various grain-size parameters have been employed to reconstruct hydrological conditions within the lake and dust influx from outside the lake. Here we present the grain-size results of a 5-m core retrieved from Lake Qinghai, northeastern Tibetan Plateau in order to address the links between Holocene depositional process and climatic change. Our results indicate that two parameters (skewness and grain-size ratio of 8-50/2-8 mu m) are sensitive to hydrodynamic changes in Lake Qinghai, which are further linked to the strength of the Asian summer monsoon. Variations of these two parameters reveal that summer monsoon intensity weakened gradually from early to late Holocene, superimposed by persistent centennial variability with dominant periods at 0.35, 0.23 and 0.12 kyr. Comparison of grain-size variations with solar activities and North Atlantic cooling events reveals that solar forcing likely plays an important role in driving centennial monsoon variability.

On the basis of the field survey, the author conducted a water quality sampling survey in the study area in spring and summer in 2012. The main excessive factors in the study area are determined as TN and TP. Using HJ1A/1B CCD multi-spectral data, the multiple linear regression inversion model and neural network inversion model are established for content of TN and TP. In accordance with these inversion results, the single factor water quality identification indexes in the study area are obtained. The results show that, BP neural network model boasts the highest inversion accuracy and that the single factor water quality identification indexes resulting from its inversion results are highly accurate, reliable and applicable, which can really reflect the changes in water quality and better realize the evaluation of water quality in the study area. Water quality evaluation results show that the water pollution in the study area is organic pollution; the water quality of Han River experiences large differences in different regions and seasons; downstream indexes are superior to upstream indexes, and the indexes in summer are superior to those in spring; the TN index seriously exceeds the standard in spring and the TP index seriously exceeds the standard in some regions.

The available 21-year long (1990-2010) data set from a small pristine humic lake, in southern Finland, consisted of 27 meteorological, physical, chemical, and biological variables. The SOM grouped the data into three categories of which the first one was the largest with 12 variables, including metabolic processes, dissolved oxygen, total nitrogen and phosphorus, chlorophyll a, and taxonomical groups of plankton known to exist in spring. The second cluster comprised of water temperature and precipitation together with cyanobacteria, algae, rotifers, and crustacean zooplankton, an association emphasized with summer. The third cluster was consisted of six physical and chemical variables linked to autumn, and to the effects of inflowand/or water columnmixing. SOMis a usefulmethod for grouping the variables of such a largemulti-dimensional data set, especially, when the purpose is to draw comprehensive conclusions rather than to search for associations across sporadic variables. Sampling should minimize the number of missing values. Even flexible statistical techniques, such as SOM, are vulnerable to biased results due to incomplete data.

J	Lenard, T; Ejankowski, W				Lenard, Tomasz; Ejankowski, Wojciech			Natural water brownification as a shift in the phytoplankton community in a deep hard water lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The effect of long-term changes in total precipitation on physical and chemical parameters of the water and the structure of phytoplankton community during a year were studied in a deep hard water lake. With respect to total precipitation, two different periods were distinguished: dry and wet. In the wet period, the water level rose and caused an increase in the water colour and a decrease in the electrolytic conductivity and concentration of nutrients. These changes were reflected in the composition and amount of phytoplankton. Certain phytoplankton groups, e.g. Cryptophyceae, Dinophyceae, Chrysophyceae, Bacillariophyceae and Chlorophyta/Charophyta, were positively affected by the environmental changes; instead, these effects were not observed in Cyanobacteria and Euglenophyta. The development of flagellates, such as Cryptomonas curvata, Plagioselmis nannoplanctica and Ceratium hirundinella, was enhanced during the wet period, whereas the dry period favoured non-flagellates, such as Planktothrix agardhii, Planktothrix rubescens and Limnothrix planctonica. Hence, the long-term variability in total precipitation can be a switch from non-flagellate-to flagellate-dominated phytoplankton in lakes. Moreover, a short time of ice cover duration in winter linked with the wet period promoted phytoplankton groups typical for spring and autumn, e.g. Cryptophyceae and Bacillariophyceae.

This study explores the potential signal for the YRB precipitation in JJ and reveals that the Tibetan Plateau tropospheric temperature (TPTT) in the middle and upper levels during the preceding December-January (DJ) is significantly correlated with JJ YRB precipitation. The close connection between the DJ TPTT anomaly with JJ YRB precipitation may be due to the joint modulation of the DJ ENSO and spring TP soil temperatures. The lagged response to an anomalously cold TPTT during the preceding DJ is a TPTT that is still anomalously cold during the following JJ. The lower TPTT can lead to an anomalous anticyclone to the east of Lake Baikal, an anomalous cyclone at the middle latitudes of East Asia, and an anomalous anticyclone over the western North Pacific. Meanwhile, the East Asian westerly jet shifts southward in response to the meridional thermal gradient caused by the colder troposphere extending from the TP to the east of Lake Baikal. The above-mentioned circulation anomalies constitute the positive anomaly of the East Asia-Pacific pattern, known to be conducive to more precipitation over the YRB. Since the DJ TPTT contains both the land (TP soil temperature) and ocean (ENSO) signals, it has a closer relationship with the JJ precipitation over the YRB than the DJ ENSO alone. Therefore, the preceding DJ TPTT can be considered an alternative predictor of the JJ YRB precipitation.																			0256-1530	1861-9533				NOV	2023	40	11			SI		1986	1997		10.1007/s00376-022-2079-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00376-022-2079-1		FEB 2023											WOS:000934824200004
J	Anderson, PM; Lozhkin, AV; Belaya, BV; Glushkova, OY; Brubaker, LB				Anderson, PM; Lozhkin, AV; Belaya, BV; Glushkova, OY; Brubaker, LB			A lacustrine pollen record from near altitudinal forest limit, Upper Kolyma Region, northeastern Siberia	HOLOCENE												A sediment core that spans the last c. 15 000 yr BP was raised from Elgennya Lake (62 degrees 05'N 149 degrees 00'E, 1040 m) which is located near the altitudinal forest limit in the western Annachag Mountains of the Upper Kolyma region, northeastern Siberia. Palynological data indicate the presence of a relatively unproductive herb-Salix tundra during full-glacial times. Although Betula shrubs first appeared in this upland valley at c. 12 100 yr BP, they probably were few in number. More significant changes in the vegetation date to c. 10 100 yr BP when Alnus shrubs, and perhaps a few Larix trees, colonized the Elgennya catchment. A Larix dahurica forest established in the valley by c. 9400 yr BP. By c. 8600 yr BP, Pinus pumila grew within the forest understorey and formed a shrub tundra beyond altitudinal tree-line. Arrival times for Betula, Alnus, Larix and Pinus differ by 400 (for both Betula and Pinus), 2500 and 2200 radiocarbon years, respectively, when compared to mid-elevation sites located in the eastern Annachag Mountains. Evidence for tree-line fluctuations, originally inferred from these eastern sites, is absent in the Elgennya record. Palaeoclimatic interpretations of the pollen data from the Upper Kolyma region suggest that both summer temperature and late fall/early winter snowfall play key roles in determining the observed palaeovegetational patterns. This relationship contrasts with the Alaskan pollen records which primarily seem to reflect changes in summer conditions.																			0959-6836					SEP	1997	7	3					331	335		10.1177/095968369700700309	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/095968369700700309													WOS:A1997YB59900009

Long-term and short-term fluctuations in the numbers and catches of Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus (L.), in Windermere (northwest England)	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												All English populations of Arctic charr are found in the Lake District (northwest England). There are at least four races of charr in Windermere, the largest natural lake in England, with the north and south basins of the lake each containing two distinct races that spawn in autumn and spring respectively. Three methods have been used to estimate levels of the charr stocks ; namely gill-netting each November (1939-1991) for autumn spawners in the north basin, anglers' catches from both basins (1966-1991), echo-survey data from both basins (July 1989 - December 1991). An increase in gill-net catches from 1945 to 1965 was associated with a cull of larger pike, Esox lucius L. ; since 1965, catches have fluctuated around a high mean level. There was good, if not excellent, agreement between the anglers' catches and the gill-net catches. The ratio of anglers' catches in the north and south basins showed that catches have been relatively low in the south basin since 1984. Although there has also been an increase in brown trout, Salmo trutta L., taken by the charr anglers since 1984 in the south basin, this increase was not responsible for the lower charr catches. When estimates of fish densities with an echo sounder were restricted to fish > 20 cm and depths down to 20 m, this being roughly the stock available to charr anglers, there was good agreement between monthly estimates and anglers' catches, especially in the north basin. The echo-sounder data confirmed the higher numbers in the north basin, and lower numbers in winter in both basins. The three different methods therefore provided comparable data on the fluctuations in levels of charr stocks in Windermere. Possible reasons for these fluctuations are discussed briefly.																			0003-4088					JAN	1992	28	2					135	146		10.1051/limn/1992012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/1992012													WOS:000208073300005

The UWC Pakistan is one of the Ramsar sites of international importance. However, the information regarding water quality parameters and concentration of potentially harmful elements (PHEs) is relatively short. Present study focused on spatio-temporal variations in the physico-chemical parameters and PHE (Cd, Pb, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cr, As, Mn) concentrations in water and fish samples using inductively coupled plasma. Sampling was done in summer (August 2016) and winter (January 2017) seasons. The overall concentrations of PHEs in water were in the following order: Mn > Zn > Cu > Cr > Ni > Cd > Pb > As for Khabeki; As >Ni > Cr > Mn > Zn > Cu > Cd > Pb for Uchalli; and Mn > Zn > Ni > Cu > As > Cr > Cd > Pb for Jahlar Lake. PHE concentration in fish followed the order Ni > Cd > Mn > Pb > Cu > Zn > Cr > As. PHEs analysis showed that Mn; Ni and As; and Ni and Mn in summer were above the Pakistan Environmental Quality Standards (PEQS) and World Health Organization (WHO) standards in Khabeki, Uchalli, and Jahlar Lakes respectively while in winter, Mn; Cd, Ni, and As; and Ni and Mn were higher than standard values in Khabeki, Uchalli, and Jahlar Lakes respectively. In fish samples, only Cd (0.0942) was higher in summer as compared to winter (0.0512) while other seven PHEs observed were higher in winter. Conclusively, the metal pollution index showed that water quality of UWC is not very fit for human consumption directly. The bioconcentration factor results indicated potential to accumulate PHEs, i.e., Cd (29.4375 and 9.4814), Pb (16.66 and 4.375), and Ni (4.9875 and 6.206), in fish during both sampling campaigns. Target hazard quotient (THQ), target carcinogenic risk (TR), hazard index (HI), estimated daily intake (EDI), and international safe standard limits of PHEs for fish species indicated that fish from UWC is safe for human consumption. Variations in physic-chemical parameters and PHE concentration were observed spatially and temporally that could be caused by precipitation amount or natural geochemistry of the lakes' crust. The water quality was not suitable for direct human consumption. Fish was only found in Khabeki Lake that had potential to accumulate Cd, Pb, and Ni more as compared to other studied PHEs.

J	Ai, Y; Bi, YH; Hu, ZY				Ai Ying; Bi Yonghong; Hu Zhengyu			Response of predominant phytoplankton species to anthropogenic impacts in Lake Taihu	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												A year-long investigation of patterns in dominant phytoplankton species was conducted to reveal the response of the phytoplankton community to anthropogenic impacts in Lake Taihu. Microcystis spp. and Cyclotella meneghiniana were the predominant species throughout the lake. Another 14 taxa were codominant species in parts of the lake. In the northwest, the highest phytoplankton biovolume appeared and Microcystis spp. and C. meneghiniana alternately dominated. Aulacoseira granulata, Asterionella formosa and Synedra spp. codominated in succession with C. meneghiniana in winter and spring. Species diversity indices were highest in spring while lowest in summer and anthropogenic nutrient inputs were the key factors controlling the alternating dominance of phytoplankton species. In the Gonghu area (the northeast), Microcystis spp. and C. meneghiniana codominated all year long; the predominant species was determined by water transfer from the Yangtze River, where the codominant species took advantage of flushing and mixing. In the southwest and the lake center with weak anthropogenic impacts, internal nutrient release was the key factor affecting the codominance of Microcystis spp. and C. meneghiniana all year long as well as the codominance of A. granulata, Dolichospermum flos-aquae and Ceratium spp. in succession. It could be concluded that anthropogenic influences shaped the structure of the phytoplankton community and determined the composition of dominant species in Lake Taihu. Species diversity was significantly correlated with nutrient inputs. Not only exogenous P reduction, but also internal P source reduction should be undertaken to prevent harmful cyanobacterial bloom. Water transfer could be used as an emergency management for bloom control.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				JAN 2	2015	30	1			SI		99	112		10.1080/02705060.2014.992052	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2014.992052													WOS:000349681100001
J	Vilbaste, S; Sundbäck, K; Nilsson, C; Truu, J				Vilbaste, S; Sundbäck, K; Nilsson, C; Truu, J			Distribution of benthic diatoms in the littoral zone of the Gulf of Riga, the Baltic Sea	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												The composition (% relative abundance) of the benthic diatom community was studied in the littoral zone (0-5 m) of the NW and E coasts of the brackish, non-tidal Gulf of Riga, in the Baltic Sea. The samples were collected concomitantly with measurements of sediment primary productivity and chlorophyll a during three cruises, representing three seasons (autumn, spring, summer). At all depths, the living diatom community was dominated by epipsammic species, the most abundant taxa being Martyana atomus, a species of Fragilariaceae and Achnanthes delicatula. The community was characterized by a stable composition and a high species diversity throughout the study period (Shannon-Weaver, mean H' = 4.4). Principal Component Analyses (PCA), together with Redundancy Analysis (RDA) based on 129 taxa, revealed both spatial (site and depth) and seasonal differences in the diatom communities. However, these differences were mainly caused by the varying proportions of taxa common in both sampling areas in ail three seasons, rather than by actual major taxonomic changes in the species present in communities. The distribution of the typical epipsammic species along the depth gradient was not uni-directional. The dominance of attached life forms, and the absence of a well-developed epipelic community, reflects the physically dynamic substratum, particularly in the eastern part of the Gulf. As a result, primary productivity is kept rather low, decreasing rapidly with depth due to frequent turbidity of the water column.

J	BURRUS, D; THOMAS, RL; DOMINIK, B; VERNET, JP; DOMINIK, J				BURRUS, D; THOMAS, RL; DOMINIK, B; VERNET, JP; DOMINIK, J			CHARACTERISTICS OF SUSPENDED SEDIMENT IN THE UPPER RHONE RIVER, SWITZERLAND, INCLUDING THE PARTICULATE FORMS OF PHOSPHORUS	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Six stations along the Upper Rhone River above Lake Geneva were sampled by continuous flow centrifuge for recovery of suspended sediment. The samples were taken four times, once in 1982 and three times in 1983. In addition the mouth of the river was sampled in a like manner every two weeks during 1982 until August 1983. Samples were analysed for the major elements SiO2, Al2O3, K2O, MgO, Na2O, CaO, and Fe2O3; for trace elements, Zn, Cu, Ni, Mn, and Cr; for Org. C and Kjeldahl N; and the forms of phosphorus bound as Organic P (OP), Apatite P (AP), and Non Apatite Inorganic P (NAIP). The major elements and trace metals confirmed that there is virtually no change in the major geochemical characteristics of the suspended solids in the Rhone, spatially or temporally, indicating that this river is a well-mixed sedimentary system. AP also remained consistent in concentration throughout the year. Sediment recovered during the winter low flow, low turbidity period has been designated SED 1, whereas sediment from the high flow, high turbidity summer condition of the river has been designated SED 2. Org C, OP, and NAIP show a dramatic decrease in concentration from SED 1 to SED 2. The decline is ascribed to dilution of a relatively constant supply of organic matter and phosphorus derived mainly from point source sewage treatment plants to the Rhone. This results in variable partitioning of the OP/NAIP and Org C under the different turbidity condition in the river between winter and summer. This interpretation is confirmed by a low and consistent C-N ratio which except for March remains below 10. Higher values in March may be indicative of soil erosion during spring melt in the agricultural lands of the Rhone Valley. The estimated proportion of particulate bio-available phosphorus is 14 per cent for SED 1 and 7 per cent for SED 2. These low values would suggest that there would be no observable direct effect on the primary production of the receiving waters of Lake Geneva, which would thus respond only to the cumulative loading of phosphorus from the Rhone River.

J	Teranes, JL; McKenzie, JA; Lotter, AF				Teranes, JL; McKenzie, JA; Lotter, AF			Stable isotope response to lake eutrophication: Calibration of a high-resolution lacustrine sequence from Baldeggersee, Switzerland	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Stable isotope analyses of discrete seasonal layers from a 108-yr annually laminated freeze-core from Baldeggersee, a small, eutrophic lake in central Switzerland, provide information on the climatological and environmental factors, including lake eutrophication, that control oxygen and carbon isotopic composition of epilimnic biologically induced calcite precipitate. During the last 100 yr, Baldeggersee has undergone major increases in productivity and eutrophication in response to nutrient loading from agriculture and industrialization in the lake's watershed. Calibration of the isotopic signal in Baldeggersec to historical limnological data quantitatively links evidence of isotopic depletion in the sedimented calcite to trophic state of the lake. delta(18)O values from the spring/summer "light" sediment layers steadily diverged to more depleted values in response to historical eutrophication: measured delta(18)O values were up to -1.5 parts per thousand more negative than calculated equilibrium delta(18)O values. Evidence for C-13 depletion in the calcite, relative to equilibrium values, is more difficult to ascertain because of an overall dominance of isotopic enrichment in the dissolved inorganic pool as productivity in Baldeggersee increases. A positive association exists between the degree of oxygen 18 depletion and the calcite crystal size. Thus, large amorphous calcite grains can be used as a proxy for recognizing apparent isotopic nonequilibrium in sediment sequences from highly productive lacustrine environments from all geologic time scales. In contrast to the light layers, the oxygen isotopic composition of the calcite in the late summer/fall "dark" sediment layers is unaffected by the apparent isotope nonequilibrium. Oxygen and carbon isotope values from the dark laminae in the Baldeggersee sediment therefore provide environmental and climatological proxies that can be calibrated with known environmental and regional climate data for the last century.

Cyprinid invasive fishes, Carassius gibelio, and translocated fish Cyprinus carpio has been introduced to the Karacaoren I reservoir located in the upstream reach of the Aksu River basin. Karacaoren reservoir is also an important local habitat for native Cyprinid fishes, Capoeta antalyensis and Squalius fellowesii. In this study, we evaluated the trophic structure and interspecies trophic interactions (as isotopic niches and niche overlaps) of these Cyprinid fish using stable C and N isotopes analysis as measured by Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer. While equally all food sources contributed to the biomass of all fish species in the summer, their biomass is supported by more specialized sources in the winter season. Our results revealed increased niche breadth with increased niche overlap between C. antalyensis and C. gibelio, and C. carpio, and among C. gibelio and C. carpio in the summer, while decreased niche breadth with decreased niche overlap in the winter season. Interspecific competition has led to trophic niche divergence, which may facilitate the coexistence of native species with introduced fishes. Non-native fish were determined to have larger niche widths, which may contribute to their invasion success.

Three exceptionally strong East-Asian summer monsoon events during glacial times in the past 470 kyr	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Chinese loess sequences are interpreted as a reliable record of the past variation of the East Asian monsoon regime through the alternation of loess and paleosols units, dominated by the winter and summer monsoon, respectively. Different proxies have been used to describe this system, mostly geophysical, geochemical or sedimentological. Terrestrial mollusks are also a reliable proxy of past environmental conditions and are often preserved in large numbers in loess deposits. The analysis of the mollusk remains in the Luochuan sequence, comprising L5 loess to S0 soil, i.e. the last 500 ka, shows that for almost all identified species, the abundance is higher at the base of the interval (L5 to L4) than in the younger deposits. Using the present ecological requirements of the identified mollusk species in the Luochuan sequence allows the definition of two main mollusk groups varying during the last 500 kyr. The cold-aridiphilous individuals indicate the so-called Asian winter monsoon regime and predominantly occur during glacials, when dust is deposited. The thermal-humidiphilous mollusks are prevalent during interglacial or interstadial conditions of the Asian summer monsoon, when soil formation takes place. In the sequence, three events with exceptionally high abundance of the Asian summer monsoon indicators are recorded during the L5, L4 and L2 glacial intervals, i.e., at about 470, 360 and 170 kyr, respectively. The L5 and L4 events appear to be the strongest (high counts). Similar variations have also been identified in the Xifeng sequence, distant enough from Luochuan, but also in Lake Baikal further North, to suggest that this phenomenon is regional rather than local. The indicators of the summer monsoon within the glacial intervals imply a strengthened East-Asian monsoon interpreted as corresponding to marine isotope stages 12, 10 and 6, respectively. The L5 and L2 summer monsoons are coeval with Mediterranean sapropels S12 and S6, which characterize a strong African summer monsoon with relatively low surface water salinity in the Indian Ocean. Changes in the precipitation regime could correspond to a response to a particular astronomical configuration (low obliquity, low precession, summer solstice at perihelion) leading to an increased summer insolation gradient between the tropics and the high latitudes and resulting in enhanced atmospheric water transport from the tropics to the African and Asian continents. However, other climate drivers such as reorganization of marine and atmospheric circulations, tectonic, and the extent of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheet are also discussed.

Seasonal fluctuations in consumer delta C-13 and delta N-15 were attributed to the combined impacts of temporal variation in isotopic signatures of basal resources and the diet shift of fishes. Based on a two-end-member mixing model, all target consumers relied on energy sources from coupled benthic and planktonic pathways, but the predominant energy source for most species was highly variable across seasons, showing seasonal trophic shift of littoral consumers. Seasonality in energy mobilization of consumers focused on two aspects: (1) the species number of consumers that relied mainly on planktonic carbon showed the lowest values in the fall and the highest during spring/summer, and (2) most consumer species showed seasonal variation in the percentages of planktonic reliance. We concluded that seasonal trophic shifts of fishes and invertebrates were driven by phytoplankton production, but benthic resources were also important seasonally in supporting littoral consumers in Meiliang Bay. Energy mobilization of carnivorous fishes was more subject to the impact of resource availability than omnivorous species.					qin, jh/IWM-7624-2023; Xie, Ping/AAL-7532-2020														1537-744X						2011	11						1442	1454		10.1100/tsw.2011.134	http://dx.doi.org/10.1100/tsw.2011.134								21805013					WOS:000293344400002

Viral and bacterial abundances showed a significant variation between the lakes, with the highest benthic microbial abundances recorded in a high-altitude lake [993 in above sea level (a.s.l.)], whereas the highest pelagic microbial abundances were found in a low-altitude lake (270ma.s.l.). In the pelagic habitat, there was also a distinct difference in microbial abundances between the summer-autumn and the winter sampling occasion. A positive relationship was noted between viruses and bacteria in both the pelagic and the benthic habitats. Visibly virus-infected bacterial cells were uncommon in the pelagic habitat and undetectable in the benthos. Both lytic and lysogenic pelagic viral production rates were undetectable or low; thus, a possible explanation for the relative high viral abundances found in the water column could be an allochthonous input of viruses or release of sediment-derived viruses. Overall, our results provide novel information about the relevance of viruses in the subarctic region and indicate that viruses play only a minor role in the nutrient and carbon cycling in the microbial communities of subarctic lakes.

Long-term trends in hypolimnetic volumes and dissolved oxygen concentrations in Boreal Shield lakes of south-central Ontario, Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Temperature-oxygen profiles, collected biweekly to monthly for similar to 40 years, were used to calculate end-of-summer volume-weighted hypolimnetic oxygen (VWHO) concentrations in six small lakes located in south-central Ontario, Canada. Coherent decreases in thermocline depth and increases in hypolimnetic volume, mean hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, and VWHO were observed in five of the six study lakes. All lakes underwent an abrupt increase in VWHO and mean hypolimnetic DO after 2010. In four of the six study lakes, the highest hypolimnetic DO concentrations were observed in years where chlorophyll a concentrations were low, whereas at five of the six study lakes the highest hypolimnetic volumes were observed when dissolved organic carbon concentrations were relatively high. Warmer spring or winter air temperatures were associated with higher hypolimnetic DO concentrations at two sites, and longer ice-free periods were associated with smaller hypolimnetic volumes at two sites. These results suggest that the recent VWHO increases in the studied south-central Ontario lakes may be a function of multiple drivers that include changes in primary production, lake water transparency, and regional climatic factors.

Diversity of movement patterns of Longnose Gar tracked in coastal waters of western Lake Ontario	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Understanding the spatial ecology of fish is critical for effective conservation and management. Gar (Lepisosteidae spp.) are an ancient lineage of freshwater fishes that have long been thought of as having high site fidelity with limited large-scale movements. We acoustically tagged Longnose Gar (L. osseus) in a large freshwater embayment (Hamilton Harbour) and tracked the movements of 12 individuals within this system and throughout the coastal waters of Lake Ontario for up to 4 years. Three distinct movement patterns were observed: migrants (N = 7), which moved throughout much of western Lake Ontario and had a maximum displacement of 184 km (linear distance); residents (N = 3), which remained in or near the original tagging location (an industrial slip with year-round warmwater outfall); and sporadic migrants (N = 2), which showed both migratory and resident behavioural patterns in different years. Seasonally, gar were most active during the summer and then fall, with more restricted home ranges and movements during winter suggestive of more quiescent behaviour. This study represents the first use of acoustic telemetry to track Longnose Gar movements year-round in a large lake and confirmed that a majority of tracked fishes make large-scale movements in Lake Ontario. Such results reframe the presumption that gar are more resident fishes with restricted space use.					; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010	Croft-White, Melanie/0000-0001-6705-6920; 													0378-1909	1573-5133				DEC	2024	107	12			SI		1405	1420		10.1007/s10641-023-01491-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-023-01491-1		NOV 2023											WOS:001110765500001
J	Kufel, L; Lesniczuk, S				Kufel, Lech; Lesniczuk, Szymon			Hydrological connectivity as most probable key driver of chlorophyll and nutrients in oxbow lakes of the Bug River (Poland)	LIMNOLOGICA												Concentrations of chlorophyll, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus, total phosphorus and suspended solids were analysed in 10 oxbow lakes of the Bug River in spring and summer. According to their connectivity with the river, all lakes were divided into 3 categories - lakes connected with the river channel but separated from the floodplain inputs, lakes connected with the river but receiving inputs from the floodplain and totally isolated lakes. Connected lakes showed significantly higher concentrations of available nutrients and chlorophyll but the relationship between the two variables was weak in the spring and non-existent in the summer. Suspended solids were also more abundant in connected than in isolated lakes. Analyses of the proportion of chlorophyll and particulate phosphorus in suspension led us to the conclusion that water movement in connected lakes inhibited sedimentation and kept algae in the water column. Isolated oxbow lakes devoid of wind-driven mixing were more susceptible to algal sedimentation which would explain the differences observed between the two lake categories. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

Previous studies have highlighted the important role of intensive human activities in IMP lake shrinkage. However, this study found that climate change-induced summer precipitation variations can exert great influences on the IMP lake area variations. The results suggest that the decadal shift in the IMP summer precipitation may be the predominant contributor to lake shrinkage. Further analysis reveals that the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) and Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) play important roles in the IMP summer precipitation variations. The AMO seems to provide beneficial large-scale circulation fields for the decadal variations in the IMP summer precipitation, and the Arctic SIC decline is favorable for weakening the IMP summer precipitation intensity after the late 1990s. Evidence indicates that the vorticity advection related to the Arctic SIC decline can result in the generation of Rossby wave resources in the midlatitudes. Then, the strengthened wave resources become favorable for enhancing the stationary wave propagation across Eurasia and inducing cyclonic circulation over the Mongolia-Baikal regions, which might bring more rainfall northward and weaken the IMP summer precipitation intensity. Consequently, due to the decreased rainfall and gradual warming after the late 1990s, the lake area in the IMP has experienced a downward trend in recent years.					; Zhang, Guoqing/F-1438-2019; Sun, Jianqi/A-7084-2016; Huopo, Chen/B-7771-2013	Liu, Yong/0000-0003-0837-0244; Zhang, Guoqing/0000-0003-2090-2813; 													0894-8755	1520-0442				FEB	2020	33	4					1335	1349		10.1175/JCLI-D-19-0388.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-19-0388.1													WOS:000507300800004

Algae from the spring bloom resulted in optimal population growth, whereas the green algae and cyanobacteria were of poorer quality. Daphnia showed the highest growth rates in all resources tested. Chydorus attained similar positive growth rates in most of the resources. In contrast, Bosmina achieved positive growth only in Stephanodiscus and Rhodomonas. For Bosmina, a combination of Stephanodiscus and Rhodomonas resulted in a positive synergisic effect on growth. The quality of resources depends greatly on the grazer of interest and cannot be generalized from results with Daphnia alone.

Spatiotemporal dynamics of wetted soils across a polar desert landscape	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Liquid water is scarce across the landscape of the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV), Antarctica, a 3800 km(2) ice-free region, and is chiefly associated with soils that are adjacent to streams and lakes (i.e. wetted margins) during the annual thaw season. However, isolated wetted soils have been observed at locations distal from water bodies. The source of water for the isolated patches of wet soil is potentially generated by a combination of infiltration from melting snowpacks, melting of pore ice at the ice table, and melting of buried segregation ice formed during winter freezing. High resolution remote sensing data gathered several times per summer in the MDV region were used to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of wet soils. The spatial consistency with which the wet soils occurred was assessed for the 2009-10 to 2011-12 summers. The remote sensing analyses reveal that cumulative area and number of wet soil patches varies among summers. The 2010-11 summer provided the most wetted soil area (10.21 km(2)) and 2009-10 covered the least (5.38 km(2)). These data suggest that wet soils are a significant component of the MDV cold desert land system and may become more prevalent as regional climate changes.

J	Wang, ZY; Zhou, BT				Wang, Zunya; Zhou, Botao			Observed Decadal Transition in Trend of Autumn Rainfall over Central China in the Late 1990s	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												This article presents a decadal transition from a decreasing trend to an increasing trend in the late 1990s for autumn rainfall in central China. The atmospheric and oceanic background underlying this regime shift is also addressed. Accompanying the above decadal transition, the moisture convergence and ascending motion averaged in central China both switch from a weakening trend to a strengthening trend. Meanwhile, after the late 1990s, the declining of the Asian sea level pressure (SLP) and the deepening of the Lake Balkhash trough may induce more cold air from high latitudes to break out southward. The strengthening of the low-level southerly in East Asia could transport more moisture northward from low latitudes. More cold air and more warm-moist airflow encountering in the targeted region contribute to the increasing trend of local rainfall. The situation before the late 1990s is generally reversed, which accounts for the decreasing trend of autumn rainfall. The movement of the East Asian jet (EAJ) from southward to northward also has a contribution via its influence on dynamic condition. Additionally, changes in the sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the western Indian and Atlantic Oceans from a cooling trend to a warming trend in the late 1990s play significant roles through their modulations on moisture transport and cold-air activities.						zhou, Botao/0000-0002-5995-2378													0894-8755	1520-0442				MAR	2019	32	5					1395	1409		10.1175/JCLI-D-18-0112.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-18-0112.1													WOS:000457453100004

We use the model in conjunction with field estimates of growth, diet, temperature experience, and mercury concentration to examine the seasonal patterns in methyl mercury uptake through respiration and through the food chain, and loss rates through depuration. Seasonal variation in environmental temperature, body size, diet, and prey availability create seasonal variation in the rate of methyl mercury uptake and in the proportion of uptake from aqueous and food sources. Methyl mercury uptake was primarily from aqueous sources during the spring and fall and was dominated by food sources in the summer. Key uncertainties in our understanding of the processes of mercury uptake by fish include (i) quantitative relationships between water chemistry and respiratory uptake, (ii) quantitative estimates of intestinal tract methylation, (iii) empirical measures of the allometry of mercury depuration, and (iv) the degree of seasonal variability in mercury speciation and methylation-demethylation processes. These uncertainties hinder our ability to more fully understand and quantify the sources and pathways of uptake of mercury by fish.																			0706-652X					FEB	1996	53	2					395	407		10.1139/cjfas-53-2-395	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-53-2-395													WOS:A1996UK63200018

Information on its overwintering ecology, particularly regarding the habitat selection in its overwintering area, is scant. In order to gain a better understanding of the Ruddy Shelduck overwintering ecology, two alpine freshwater lakes and adjacent habitats were surveyed in the Yungui Plateau of Southwest China; the habitats were classified as croplands, vegetable plots, marshlands, aquatic habitats and forests. The abundance of the Ruddy Shelduck in the marshland was significantly higher in winter than in spring (P = 0.039), while the opposite was true in the forest (P = 0.024). No significant seasonal differences were detected in the croplands, vegetable plots and aquatic habitats, respectively (P = 0.302-0.817). The Ruddy Shelduck numbers differed significantly among the five habitat types both in winter (P = 0.000) and in spring (P = 0.005). The aquatic habitats and the vegetable plots showed not only the largest abundances of this species but also the lowest coefficients of variation. The abundance of the Ruddy Shelduck did not vary among different months (x(2/3) = 1.984, P = 0.576); the observed daily mean numbers, however, revealed a slight decline from December to March. When we explored the relationships between the numbers of the Ruddy Shelduck and the vegetable coverage in the vegetable plots, a multiple regression model (stepwise) indicated that the Ruddy Shelduck abundance was significantly and positively correlated with the radish (Raphanus sativus L.) coverage (R-2= 0.619, P =0.000) in winter, and significantly and positively correlated with both the cabbage (Brassica pekinensis (Lour.) Rupr.) coverage and the radish coverage (R-2 = 0.555, P =0.002) in spring. The aquatic habitats and the vegetable plots were preferred habitats and the radish was the favorite diet to the Ruddy Shelduck in its overwintering area in Southwest China. Various factors, such as agricultural activities, pollution, boat fishing, human population expansion and urbanization, are all likely to threaten birds and their habitats in Southwest China.																			0324-0770					DEC	2013	65	4					469	478																WOS:000329378400007
J	Hellweger, FL; Farley, KJ; Lall, U; Di Toro, DM				Hellweger, FL; Farley, KJ; Lall, U; Di Toro, DM			Greedy algae reduce arsenate	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Algae reduce and methylate arsenate, producing arsenite (As(III)) when the growth rates are high and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) when the growth rates are low. In lakes, this leads to high As(III) concentrations in the early stages of spring and fall blooms and high DMA concentrations in the summer. We hypothesize that under phosphorus (P)-limited conditions, which usually exist in the summer, algae take up phosphate (PO4) and, because of similar chemical characteristics, As(V) as well. Inside the cell, As(V) is reduced to As(III), methylated to monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and DMA, and then excreted. However, under non-P-limited conditions, which exist in the early stages of blooms, algae up-regulate their PO4 transport system to take up excess P a phenomenon known as luxury uptake. Since As(V) is taken up by the PO4 transport system, As(V) uptake also increases at this time. Within the cell, the reduction of As(V) to As(III) is fast, but methylation is slower, causing As(III) to build up in the cell and be excreted, which, in turn, causes an increase in extracellular As(III). This mechanism permits the synergistic (luxury uptake) and antagonistic (competition) effects of PO4 on As(V) uptake and can therefore explain the seemingly contradictory results found in the literature. A mathematical model is constructed on the basis of existing established algal-nutrient interaction models and is used to simulate As transformation in two laboratory batch experiments. In addition to algal and P responses, the model can reasonably well reproduce the observed As(III) peak during the log growth phase and the more gradual appearance of DMA during the stationary phase.

This species occurred in vegetative form in the water column all the time, although its population density varied by five orders of magnitude from a maximum of 1.4 .times. 106 cells l-1 in February to a minimum of 0.8 .times. 101 cells l-1 in August. A mathematical model of a combination of multiplicative and Liebig types suggested that vegetative cells were severely limited in their growth rate, reaching almost 80% depression of the maximum rate between December and February by low temperatures and nearly 50% depression in warm seasons by light intensity. Nutrient limitations were only observed in May, August and September, although they were not as great as by temperature and light intensity in the study lake. Population changing rates of A. formosa determined in the lake were low and agreed well with the estimated growth rates during winter, but those in summer were low and disagreed with the estimated high growth rates. This suggests that population change of the species was highly dependent upon the specific growth rate in winter, but other factors became predominant in summer.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				SEP	1989	11	5					1001	1019		10.1093/plankt/11.5.1001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/11.5.1001													WOS:A1989AQ22500008

Vertical distributions of chlorophyll in deep, warm monomictic lakes	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The factors affecting vertical distributions of chlorophyll fluorescence were examined in four temperate, warm monomictic lakes. Each of the lakes (maximum depth > 80 m) was sampled over 2 years at intervals from monthly to seasonal. Profiles were taken of chlorophyll fluorescence (as a proxy for algal biomass), temperature and irradiance, as well as integrated samples from the surface mixed layer for chlorophyll a (chl a) and nutrient concentrations in each lake. Depth profiles of chlorophyll fluorescence were also made along transects of the longest axis of each lake. Chlorophyll fluorescence maxima occurred at depths closely correlated with euphotic depth (r (2) = 0.67, P < 0.01), which varied with nutrient status of the lakes. While seasonal thermal density stratification is a prerequisite for the existence of a deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM), our study provides evidence that the depth of light penetration largely dictates the DCM depth during stratification. Reduction in water clarity through eutrophication can cause a shift in phytoplankton distributions from a DCM in spring or summer to a surface chlorophyll maximum within the surface mixed layer when the depth of the euphotic zone (z (eu)) is consistently shallower than the depth of the surface mixed layer (z (SML)). Trophic status has a key role in determining vertical distributions of chlorophyll in the four lakes, but does not appear to disrupt the annual cycle of maximum chlorophyll in winter.

Field measurements and laboratory experiments were combined in order to describe the structure and dynamics of planktonic food webs. Physico-chemical parameters were measured, and food web typology was described for the first time in the marsh using plankton biomass and internal flux assessment. Both stations changed from a "biological winter" to food webs identified as "multivorous" and passed through to a herbivorous food web. However, food web structure differed significantly between the two stations at the end of the study. Station A remained as a multivorous food web, while station B changed to a strong multivorous food web. After the sea lock gates closing (end of March), an increase in phosphorus concentrations in the water column at station B may have controlled bacterial and phytoplankton development and could explain, at least in part, the differences between the two stations. Our study suggests moreover that differences in water renewal between the two stations could have been responsible for the differences observed. Sea lock gates closing seems to be responsible for the rapid changes observed in food web structure, suggesting that the effects of human hydraulic management on ecosystem functioning in marshes is not yet well understood.					; Masclaux, Helene/S-1265-2017	Dupuy, Christine/0000-0002-5634-1336; Masclaux, Helene/0000-0002-5869-8419													1015-1621	1420-9055				JAN	2015	77	1					115	128		10.1007/s00027-014-0376-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-014-0376-1													WOS:000347149700010

Although, the study of morphometry and gyrogonite production by extant charophytes is limited. This concerns the genus Lychnothamnus, frequent in the past but contemporarily represented only by L. barbatus, the rare and endangered species applied in assessment of water quality as a bioindicator of oligo-mesotrophic lakes. In this study two hypotheses were verified: (1) the length and width of L. barbatus gyrogonites increase with increasing depth; (2) at the deeper sites, L. barbatus produces more numerous gyrogonites compared to shallower lake areas. Gyrogonites were picked from L. barbatus thalli (n = 170) collected at three depths (2-3 m, 3-4 m and 4-5 m) and three permanent transects in a meso-eutrophic lake hosting one of few largest populations of the species (Lake Kuinickie). Subfossil gyrogonites (n = 730) were also analyzed from three sediment cores taken at the same depths. The study was conducted in autumn 2016, spring, summer and autumn 2017. In addition to depth, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), nutrients and other indices of water chemistry, and interspecific competition were studied. Studied L. barbatus gyrogonites were more circular and wider compared to existing literature data. Gyrogonites production was positively correlated with depth. The smallest, but most numerous gyrogonites occurred at the deepest sites (ANOVA). Subfossil gyrogonites were slightly wider and more circular compared to extant gyrogonites. Reversely to depth, PAR was positively correlated with sizes of gyrogonites and negatively correlated with amount of gyrogonites. Gyrogonites formation was negatively correlated with ammonium ion concentration and Myriophyllum spicatum biomass, but positively with phosphate concentrations. Our results supplement the gaps in the knowledge regarding the ecology of L. barbatus because the species produced numerous gyrogonites in meso-eutrophic waters. We postulate that L. barbatus gyrogonites can be applied in ecology and palaeoecology to interpret water depth and trophic status.					; Pełechaty, Mariusz/HDN-8393-2022; Brzozowski, Michał/AAB-2500-2022	Brzozowski, Michal/0000-0002-8028-2129; Pelechaty, Mariusz/0000-0002-4075-6561; Kowalewski, Grzegorz/0000-0001-9668-1071; 													0075-9511	1873-5851				JUL	2019	77								125686	10.1016/j.limno.2019.125686	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2019.125686													WOS:000485794700005

This study investigated spatiotemporal distribution, sources and risks of 11 widely used OPEs in surface waters from seagoing rivers and multiple coastal functional areas of the Beibu Gulf. The results indicated that significantly higher n-ary sumation 11OPEs (total concentrations of 11 OPEs, ng/L) occurred in summer (34.2-1227) than in winter (20.6-840), as a result of the high emission caused by climate reasons. In general, higher n-ary sumation 11OPEs occurred in rivers (41.2-1227) than in the coast (34.2-809) in summer, especially in the urban rivers, while in winter, higher n-ary sumation 11OPEs occurred in the coast (23.4-840 vs 20.6-319 in rivers) because of obviously higher n-ary sumation 11OPEs in marine fishery areas (99-840). Source identification revealed that fishery activity, especially fishing vessels, and urban rivers were the main sources of OPEs in the Beibu Gulf. For the individual OPE, only tri-nbutyl phosphate (TNBP) may have ecological risks to aquatic organisms in a few sites, but if considering the additive effects, the OPEs mixtures would pose a high risk to algae and low to medium threats to crustaceans and fish.

Survival and Condition of Cold-Banked Juvenile Walleyes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUACULTURE												Over their broad latitudinal distribution in nature, Walleye Sander vitreus have adapted to survive long winters in ice-covered lakes and for more than 5 months when water temperatures are less than required for growth (10 degrees C). Thus, our hypothesis is that hatchery-reared fall-fingerling Walleyes may be maintained in hatchery confinement at low temperature for relatively long intervals with minimal requirement for feed and maintenance, i.e., cold banked (CB). Little information has been published, however, on survival and condition of CB fish to judge its merits. In this study, survival and condition of three cohorts (N = 1,538) of feed-trained juvenile Walleyes (181-192mm total length, 47-58g) are described after overwintering for 125-153 d in indoor culture tanks that were supplied with lake water of ambient winter temperature and pelleted feed. The mean for survival of three tanks of CB fish in each cohort was 85.8, 91.7, and 98.6% at corresponding mean water temperatures of 7.6, 8.3, and 6.8 degrees C, where the lowest temperature ranged from 3.3 degrees C to 4 degrees C. The difference in mean length, weight, and condition from start to finish was small and statistically significant in only 1 of 3years. Accelerated growth was observed in recaptured CB Walleyes 2 and 3years after they were stocked into an 8-ha lake. The findings of this study suggest that cold banking can be used to hold Walleyes overwinter for subsequent spring stocking, with minimum loss of stock, or for holding back stock in a commercial facility for grow out.

Annual velocity increased each year from 51.780.01myr(-1) in 2009 to 52.920.01myr(-1) in 2012a net increase of 2.2%. These data also reveal a strong seasonal velocity cycle of up to 8.1% above the winter mean, driven by seasonal melt and supraglacial lake drainage. Sole et al. (2013) recently argued that ice motion in the ablation area is mediated by reduced winter flow following the development of efficient subglacial drainage during warmer, faster, summers. Our data extend this analysis and reveal a year-on-year increase in annual velocity above the equilibrium line altitude, where despite surface melt increasing, it is still sufficiently low to hinder the development of efficient drainage under thick ice.					; Hubbard, Alun/R-5085-2017	van As, Dirk/0000-0002-6553-8982; Hubbard, Alun/0000-0002-0503-3915; Doyle, Samuel/0000-0002-0853-431X; Hubbard, Bryn/0000-0002-3565-3875													0094-8276	1944-8007				FEB 16	2014	41	3					899	905		10.1002/2013GL058933	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2013GL058933													WOS:000332990500022

Analysis of current trends in climate parameters, river discharge and glaciers in the Aksu River basin (Central Asia)	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL												Climate variability and change play a crucial role in the vulnerable system of the Aksu River basin located in Kyrgyzstan and northwest China, providing precious water resources for the intense oasis agriculture of the Xinjiang Province (China). Ubiquitous warming and increase in precipitation (in the lower part of the basin) have been detected. Glaciers in the region are retreating. Seasonal trends in river discharge show an increase. A clear link could be demonstrated between daily temperature and lagged river discharge at two headwater stations in summer. However, the correlation breaks over short periods in the end of summer or beginning of autumn at the Xiehela station, when the high (over 95th percentile) flow peaks caused by the glacier lake outburst floods of the Merzbacher Lake occur. This feature is a challenge for the climate impact assessment in the region, as these regular outbursts have to be represented in the projections for the future as well. [GRAPHICS] Editor D.

In this study, fluorescence region integration and high-throughput sequencing techniques were used to investigate the spatiotemporal character-istics and dynamic response of DOM and aerobic denitrifying bacteria. The DOM compositions were significantly different among the four seasons (P < 0.001) without spatial differences. Tryptophan-like substances (P2, 27.89-42.67%) and microbial metabolites (P4, 14.62-42.03%) were the dominant components, and DOM exhibited strong autogenous characteristics. Abundant (AT), moderate (MT), and rare taxa (RT) of aerobic denitrifying bacteria showed significant and spatiotemporal differences (P < 0.05). The responses of alpha-diversity and niche breadth of AT and RT to DOM differed. The DOM explanation proportion for aerobic denitrifying bacteria exhibited spatiotemporal differences based on redundancy analysis. Foliate-like substances (P3) had the highest interpretation rate of AT in spring and summer, while humic-like substances (P5) had the highest interpretation rate of RT in spring and winter. Network analysis showed that RT networks were more complex than AT networks. Pseudomonas was the main genus associated with DOM in AT on a temporal scale, and was more strongly correlated with tyrosine-like substances (P1), P2, and P5. Aeromonas was the main genus asso-ciated with DOM in AT on a spatial scale and was more strongly correlated with P1 and P5. Magnetospirillum was the main genus associated with DOM in RT on a spatiotemporal scale, which was more sensitive to P3 and P4. Special operational taxonomic units were transformed between AT and RT with seasonal changes, but not be-tween the two regions. To summarize, our results revealed that bacteria with different abundances utilized DOM components differently, and provides new insight on the spatiotemporal response of DOM and aerobic deni-trifying bacteria in aquatic ecosystems of biogeochemical significance.

Seasonal phosphorus dynamics in the surficial sediment of two shallow temperate lakes: a solid-phase and pore-water study	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This study examined phosphorus (P) dynamics by surveying the solid-phase and pore-water of the surficial sediment in a mesotrophic and eutrophic shallow lake in Maine, USA. Both lakes were dimictic, developed hypolimnetic anoxia, and released sedimentary P. We examined the controls on sedimentary P release by considering two possible mechanisms; mineralization and release of sedimentary organic P, and dissolution of Fe hydroxide following the onset of anoxia. The temporal investigation of solid-phase included sequential chemical extraction and P-31 NMR analysis, and the pore-water included use of equilibrium samplers. In both lakes, the relative contribution of organic P to total sedimentary P release was minor compared to Fe hydroxide-associated P. The eutrophic lake, however, had more evidence of microbial uptake of sedimentary P and a higher degree of rapid P transformation in the water column. Sediment polyphosphates were dynamic and possibly contributed to hypolimnetic P accumulation. The pore-water Fe and P profiles exhibited similar temporal patterns as the solid-phase results. Together, they showed an upward migration of the redoxcline in the sediment, from winter to summer, resulting in the accumulation of Fe-bound P at the sediment-water interface in the winter followed by its release into the summer.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2013	701	1					65	77		10.1007/s10750-012-1257-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1257-z													WOS:000312339100006
J	Son, S; Wang, MH				Son, Seunghyun; Wang, Menghua			Water Quality Properties Derived from VIIRS Measurements in the Great Lakes	REMOTE SENSING												Refined empirical algorithms for chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, using the maximum ratio of normalized water-leaving radiance nL(w)(lambda) at the blue and green bands, and Secchi depth (SD) from nL(w)(lambda) at 551 nm, nL(w)(551), are proposed for the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite in the Great Lakes. We demonstrated that water quality properties and phytoplankton production can be successfully monitored and assessed using the new regional Chl-a and SD algorithms, with reasonably accurate estimates of Chl-a and SD from the VIIRS-SNPP ocean color data in the Great Lakes. VIIRS-derived Chl-a and SD products using the proposed algorithms provide the temporal and spatial variabilities in the Great Lakes. Overall, Chl-a concentrations are generally low in lakes Michigan and Huron, while Chl-a data are highest in Lake Erie. The seasonal pattern shows that overall low Chl-a concentrations appear in winter and high values in June to September in the lakes. The distribution of SD in the Great Lakes is spatially and temporally different from that of Chl-a. The SD data are generally lower in summer and higher in winter in most of the Great Lakes. However, the highest SD in Lake Erie appears in summer, and lower values in winter. Significantly high values in Chl-a, and lower values in SD, in the nearshore regions, such as Thunder Bay, Saginaw Bay, and Whitefish Bay, can be related to the very shallow bathymetry and freshwater inputs from the land. The time series of VIIRS-derived Chl-a and SD data provide strong interannual variability in most of the Great Lakes.					; Wang, Menghua/F-5631-2010	, unhson/0009-0007-3335-7566; Wang, Menghua/0000-0001-7019-3125														2072-4292				MAY	2020	12	10							1605	10.3390/rs12101605	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12101605													WOS:000543394800072

In this paper, climatic, morphometric and chemical-environmental aspects of six lacustrine bodies of the Salado River basin, Buenos Aires, are analyzed. The climatic variability of the region was estimated and linked to the behavior of each water body during the studied period (2017-2018); precipitations displayed deviations from the mean values, with periods of deficit in spring and summer, and excess in autumn. The analysis of satellite images showed a group of lakes with very low variation of the morphometric parameters because they have gates that keep the water level constant. On the contrary, those without anthropic intervention displayed a greater morphometric variability, since the water levels have been directly linked to local weather fluctuations. From a chemical-environmental perspective, changes were observed both at the regional (p = 0.015) and local (p = 0.0014) levels. Differences among sites cannot be characterized by a single variable but by a set of them. The dominant cation in the Pampean shallow lakes is the Na+ coming from the contact of groundwater with loessic sediments. Lakes showed a particular anionic dominance that not following a seasonal but a particular pattern. These are mainly linked to the characteristics of the substrate (presence of marine sediments or gypsum deposits). The great vulnerability of these environments to global and regional climatic changes, anthropic modifications and a large number of shallow lakes in the area, allow finding different scenarios (geomorphological, ecological, hydrogeological, etc.) to assess their vulnerability and predict their behavior against future climate scenarios in an economically important area for Argentine.

Phytoplankton of the reservoirs of Central and North Patagonia	FRESHWATER PHYTOPLANKTON OF ARGENTINA: PHYTOPLANKTON DIVERSITY AND ECOLOGY IN DIFFERENT AQUATIC SYSTEMS	Advances in Limnology											The basins of the Limay, Neuquen, and Negro rivers comprise the greatest hydrographic system developed in its entirety in Argentina. The reservoirs constructed in this basin are distinguished by their numbers, dimensions and unitary system of management. Within the framework of environmental-monitoring programs carried out from 1977 to the present, 394 species were identified in these systems. Only 30 taxa were common to all the reservoirs. Some of the dominant taxa were: Anabaena spp. (toxic complex), Ceratium hirundinella, Gymnodinium sp., Asterionella formosa, Aulacoseira ambigua var. ambigua f. spiralis, Aulacoseira pseudogranulata, Aulacoseira subarctica, and Stephanodiscus niagarae. Chlorophyta and Chrysophyta were the algal groups with the highest species richness. The Cyanobacteria played a significant role, and so, two agendas for monitoring algal blooms were developed in the basin: (a) at one sampling station on the Limay River (near Arroyito Reservoir), (b) in the Mari Menuco reservoirs of the Neuquen River. Anabaena spp. (toxic complex) was seen to exhibit the greatest abundance between the spring, the summer, and the beginning of the autumn. Another reservoir that has been the object of limnological investigations since 1990 is the Fiorentino Ameghino, situated within the eastern-central region on the Chubut River. The centric diatoms - principally Aulacoseira granulata, Stephanodiscus sp., and Cyclotella sp. were the best represented in this reservoir. The phytoplankton was composed of species characteristic of mesotrophic to eutrophic lakes.					; Cano, María/H-9965-2014	Cano, Maria Gabriela/0000-0001-9493-2834; 													1612-166X		978-3-510-47067-9				2014	65						293	307		10.1127/1612-166X/2014/0065-0047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1612-166X/2014/0065-0047													WOS:000339640200019

In this study, daily atmospheric temperature soundings from the Puerto Montt radiosonde (41.43 degrees S) are used to reconstruct winter melting events at the glacier equilibrium line altitude in the 38 degrees-42 degrees S region of southern Chile, between 1960 and 2010. The representativeness of the radiosonde temperatures to near-surface glacier temperatures is demonstrated using meteorological records from close to the equilibrium line on two glaciers in the region over five winters. Using a degree-day model we estimate an average of 0.28 m of melt and 21 melt days in the 15 June-15 September period each year, with high inter-annual variability. The majority of melt events are associated with midlatitude migratory high pressure systems crossing Chile and northwesterly flows, that force adiabatic compression and warm advection, respectively. There are no trends in the frequency or magnitude of melt events over the period of record, but the annual frequency of winter melt days shows a significant, although rather weak and probably non-linear, relationship to late winter and early spring values of a multivariate El Nino Southern Oscillation Index (MEI).

The nature reserve 'Meteoryt Morasko' in Poland with fishless meteorite ponds was analyzed as a unique ecosystem for biological analysis of invertebrate interactions. The aim of the study was to recognize the main environmental drivers of cladoceran and copepod community structure from among biotic (competitors and predators) and abiotic factors (i.e. oxygen and pH level) in the spring season. The abundance of small cladocerans (Alonella excisa and Chydorus sphaericus) was the highest at the end of the spring season, i.e. in June, while large species (Daphnia pulex and Simocephalus exspinosus) were most abundant in May. Both size groups of Cladocera were negatively affected by invertebrate predators (Chaoborus crystallinus and carnivorous copepods), which are known to play an important role in structuring cladoceran communities due to the fishless character of the studied ponds. No negative effect of those predators was found for Copepoda, however, nauplii density was reduced by competitors (Aedes communis larvae and ostracods). The temporary character of the examined ponds, oxygen depletion and low pH of water in the shallowest pond resulted in the abundant occurrence of cladoceran males, whose high densities are usually observed in autumn.					; Kuczyńska-Kippen, Natalia/AAC-1955-2022	Kuczynska-Kippen, Natalia/0000-0002-0513-9461; 													1730-413X	1897-3191				MAR	2016	45	1					66	78		10.1515/ohs-2016-0007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/ohs-2016-0007													WOS:000375048100007

Prolonged early to middle Holocene drought in the Pacific Northwest inferred from lacustrine carbonate oxygen isotope values and sedimentology	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Sediment-based lake-level reconstructions and the oxygen isotopic composition of lacustrine carbonate (delta O-18(CO3)) provide insight on hydroclimate conditions during the early Holocene in western North America and the Pacific Northwest. There are relatively few such records with decadal temporal resolution, and changes in the isotopic composition of meteoric water potentially obscure the hydroclimate signal (precipitation-evaporation) in lacustrine delta O-18(CO3) data. Here, we present a Holocene-length drought index developed by combining the delta O-18(CO3) record from Castor Lake, a closed-basin system located in north-central Washington (USA), with the delta O-18(CO3) record from Lime Lake, which has an openbasin configuration and is located in northeastern Washington. The lake sediment records are dated using primarily a combination of radiocarbon measurements on terrestrial macrofossils, Pb-210, Cs-137, and tephrochronology. The delta O-18(CO3) drought index, along with changes in Castor Lake sediment facies, suggest periods of prolonged drought in the Pacific Northwest between 11,200 and 6200 cal yr BP, a finding that is supported by other lacustrine proxy records of lake level and temperature change. Early Holocene drought likely resulted from higher than present summer isolation that promoted longer, hotter summers and greater evaporation. Lower than present winter insolation at this time likely altered the location and/or strength of the westerlies, reducing cold season precipitation/snowpack and intensifying the dry conditions. This study highlights the sensitivity of hydroclimate in an already drought-and fire-prone region to the magnitude and duration of summer warmth and precipitation and snowpack levels during the winter.

Mild winters and rather humid summers with few extrema accompanied by phases of Fohn-winds in late winter are typical for the area. Climate parameters demonstrate its border situation between deciduous and evergreen broad-leaved forest. For ages ornithochorous laurineous, mostly eastern-asian exotic shrubs and trees were kept in alleys, parks and gardens and also a fibre palm (Trachycarpus fortunei) was introduced about 300 years ago. Since 1975 only some of these species started to expand in the surrounding forests and even regenerate spontaneously from older individuals. This development is sponsored by winter temperatures above the normal values and rather damp warm summers as well as a more extensive forest management. Up to 600 m on southfacing slopes (up to 400 m on the opposite side) different Lauraceae demonstrate a clear vegetation shift, a situation resembling conditions near Sakata/Japan at ca. 39 degrees N latitude. Also higher up the slopes, in the montane and subalpine belt, species shifts may be detected by comparing releves of the early sixties with those established in 1994. These changes in the herb layer amount to 50-100% of the former species numbers, which is about twice the values of northern Switzerland.																					3-437-25058-2				1996							537	550																WOS:000075264500071

The average concentrations of PAHs were 27.5 +/- 14.6 ng/m(3) and 49.5 +/- 20.5 ng/L in the air and water, respectively. Phenanthrene was the dominant congener in both air and water dissolved phase. Seasonality was discovered in the air with the concentrations higher in winter than in summer, but not in the water dissolved phase. Air-water exchange trends also displayed apparent seasonality with 3-4 ring PAHs generally being volatilization or equilibrium in summer but deposition in winter, which highlighted the important influence of temperature on the air-water exchange direction of PAHs. The air-water exchange fluxes of individual PAH congeners ranged from -24331 to 6541 ng/m(2)/d, and the highest deposition and volatilization fluxes both appeared at the industrial areas, which emphasized the influence of point source emission to the magnitude of air-water diffusion flux of PAHs. Multivariate source apportionment approaches, including principle component analysis, diagnostic ratios, and positive matrix factorization, were conducted, which suggested that PAHs in water originated from multiple sources. Frequent port transport correlated vehicle/ship emission rather than coal combustion may be the primary contributor of PAHs to the coastal air and water. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Miranda, LT; Whitfield, CJ				Miranda, Lauren T.; Whitfield, Colin J.			Seasonal patterns and key chemical predictors of dissolved greenhouse gases in small prairie pothole ponds	FACETS												Shallow ponds can provide ideal conditions for production of greenhouse gases (GHGs) carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), and thus are important to include in global and regional GHG budgets. The Canadian Prairie Pothole Region contains millions of shallow natural ponds, and we investigated GHG dynamics in 145 ponds across the region. Ponds were consistently supersaturated with CH4, often supersaturated with CO2 (57% occurrence), and often undersaturated with N2O (65% occurrence). Spring measurements showed higher N2O saturation (p = 0.0037) than summer, while summer had higher CH4 (p < 0.001) and CO2 (p = 0.023) saturation than spring. Ponds exhibited large physicochemical variation, yet sulfate concentration and pH were strong predictors of dissolved CH4 and CO2, respectively. No predictor was identified for N2O. The link between sulfate and CH4 has important implications as dissolved CH4 in low sulfate (<178 mg L-1) systems was much more responsive to changes in temperature. This research fills an important knowledge gap about the GHG dynamics of prairie pothole ponds and the role of water chemistry for diffuse GHG release. Our work can also be used in ongoing efforts to describe ecosystem services (or disservices) assigned to ponds in this agriculture-dominated region.

However, very little is understood about the mechanism that can transmit changes in the North Atlantic to the Far East. Here we show that the shutdown of the North Atlantic thermohalline circulation brought about significantly lower temperatures and higher precipitation in the Japanese winter, whereas the change in the Japanese summer climate was considerably smaller. The cooling of the Siberian air mass seems to have caused an increased pressure gradient between Siberia and the West Pacific in winter, intensifying the winter monsoon. The Mongolian high-pressure system and the westerly jet stream played an important role in the teleconnection. In contrast, the warming at the onset of the late glacial interstadial (GI-1; Bolling-Allerod) in the West Pacific did not have season-specific features, implying that the principal driving mechanism of this warming event may lie in a pan-hemispheric or global factor, such as insolation changes.					; Tarasov, Pavel/ABG-3993-2020	/0000-0002-7219-5009; Nakagawa, Takeshi/0000-0003-0831-6803; 													0091-7613	1943-2682				JUL	2006	34	7					521	524		10.1130/G21764A.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/G21764A.1													WOS:000238697900003

At the Peace-Athabasca Delta (Alberta, Canada), a globally recognized freshwater floodplain landscape, concerns about water-level drawdown and multiple potential stressors have prompted need to improve knowledge of lake water balances and establish a lake monitoring program. Yet, the delta's remoteness and dynamic nature present challenges to these goals. Here we use over 1000 measurements of water isotope composition at similar to 60 lakes and 9 river sites during the spring, summer and fall of five consecutive years (2015-2019) to elucidate patterns in lake water balance over time and space, the influential roles of evaporation and river floodwaters, and relations with meteorological conditions and river water levels. Calculation of evaporation-to-inflow ratios using a coupled-isotope tracer approach, displayed via generalized additive models and geospatial 'isoscapes', reveal strongly varying lake water balances. Results identify distinct areas vulnerable to lake-level drawdown, given the likelihood of continued decline in ice-jam flood frequency, longer ice-free season duration and reduced snowmelt runoff. Results also demarcate areas of the delta where lakes are more resilient to factors that cause drawdown. The former defines the Peace sector, which is influenced by floodwaters from the Peace River during episodic ice-jam flood events, whereas the latter describes portions of the active floodplain environment of the Athabasca sector which receives more frequent contributions of Athabasca River floodwaters during both spring ice-jam and open-water seasons. Efficiency of water isotope tracers to capture the marked temporal and spatial heterogeneity in lake water balances during this 5 year time span, and their diagnostic responses to key hydrological processes, serves as a foundation for ongoing lake monitoring, an approach readily transferable to other remote and dynamic lake-rich landscapes.					; Hall, Roland/K-3165-2019; Remmer, Casey/LZI-3542-2025	Kay, Mitchell/0000-0001-6975-6242; Hall, Roland/0000-0002-0314-6449; Remmer, Casey/0000-0003-2626-3012													1748-9326					OCT	2020	15	10							104066	10.1088/1748-9326/abb267	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/abb267													WOS:000577523100001

Phytoplankton development is invariably initiated by the decrease of discharge in spring. When this occurs in early spring, the bloom is dominated by diatoms that severely deplete silica, and a regular increase of their biomass is observed along the river continuum from headwaters to the estuary. The bloom occurs earlier downstream than upstream. Chlorophyceae succeed the diatoms by the end of May and represent a significant component of the summer phytoplankton population. Fluctuations of the phytoplankton biomass are observed within the continuum in summer, with high biomass in 6th-order rivers, low biomass in 7th-order rivers, and again high biomass in 8th-order rivers. These seasonal and spatial variations are interpreted with the aid of a mathematical model (the RIVERSTRAHLER model); the model calculates the development of diatoms and Chlorophyceae within the whole drainage network which is represented as a regular pattern of confluences of tributaries with increasing stream order. The model, taking into account both bottom-up and top-down regulating factors of phytoplankton, has proved to be a powerful tool in understanding the dynamics of a large drainage network.

Echinostomes were common to all lakes, one species overlapping between Pyykosjarvi and Kuuhankavesi (Echinostoma revolutum). All three lymnaeid populations also harboured xiphidiocercariae of Plagiorchis elegans, furcocercariae of Diplostomum pseudospathaceum and Trichobilharzia ocellata and the monostome Notocotylus attenuatus. A consistent seasonal pattern of infection was recorded for four of the parasites in Pyykosjarvi, although annual variation in mean prevalence was generally significant. Annual parasite species composition within the three lakes was relatively stable despite the long dormant winter. This may be due to the over-wintering of larval digeneans in infected snails that then act as a source of reinfection of bird definitive hosts each spring.

Relatively little is known about thermal tolerances and requirements of this species in situ during the overwintering period, except that these turtles must find water bodies that do not freeze completely and that are sufficiently cool to allow them to stay dormant throughout the winter. We used water temperature data associated with Blanding's Turtle populations in a northern, central, and southern study area within Ontario, Canada to determine thermal characteristics of occupied overwintering habitats. From fall through spring from 2012 to 2014, we measured water temperature of 20 potential overwintering habitats within the three study areas. We also radio tracked 48 adult turtles to determine which habitats they occupied during winter. Water temperatures of all occupied habitats ranged from 0.44 degrees C to 3.68 degrees C, with a mean of 1.77 degrees C (+/- 0.03 degrees C), and showed slow steady declines throughout the overwintering period. Regardless of location, average water temperatures at all confirmed overwintering habitats remained above the freezing point of turtle body fluids (-0.6 degrees C). Average water temperature at five of the six confirmed overwintering habitats never dropped below 0 degrees C, but dropped to -0.33 degrees C for eight days at the sixth overwintering habitat. Determining thermal parameters of overwintering sites can provide knowledge useful for habitat restoration and creation to ensure habitats provide suitable overwintering conditions in the face of global climate change.

S.; Lopez, S.; Southwick, C. D.; Sparrow, E. L.; Bowling, D. R.			Wide variation of winter-induced sustained thermal energy dissipation in conifers: a common-garden study	OECOLOGIA												Low temperature in winter depresses rates of photosynthesis, which, in evergreen plants, can exacerbate imbalances between light absorption and photochemical light use. Damage that could result from increased excess light absorption is minimized by the conversion of excitation energy to heat in a process known as energy dissipation, which involves the de-epoxidized carotenoids of the xanthophyll cycle. Overwintering evergreens employ sustained forms of energy dissipation observable even after lengthy periods of dark acclimation. Whereas most studies of photoprotective energy dissipation examine one or a small number of species; here, we measured the levels of sustained thermal energy dissipation of seventy conifer taxa growing outdoors under common-garden conditions at the Red Butte Garden in Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S.A. (forty nine taxa were also sampled for needle pigment content). We observed an extremely wide range of wintertime engagement of sustained energy dissipation; the percentage decrease in dark-acclimated photosystem II quantum efficiency from summer to winter ranged from 6 to 95%. Of the many pigment-based parameters measured, the magnitude of the seasonal decrease in quantum efficiency was most closely associated with the seasonal increase in zeaxanthin content expressed on a total chlorophyll basis, which explained only slightly more than one-third of the variation. We did not find evidence for a consistent wintertime decrease in needle chlorophyll content. Thus, the prevailing mechanism for winter decreases in solar-induced fluorescence emitted by evergreen forests may be decreases in fluorescence quantum yield, and wintertime deployment of sustained energy dissipation likely underlies this effect.

Zinc and Cr concentrations in surface water samples were detected using the ICP-MS device. According to the data obtained the lowest Zn and Cr concentrations in the spring season were 65.43 +/- 3.2 mu g/L in March at 10th day for Zn and 0.28 +/- 0.02 mu g/L in March at 10th and 20th day for Cr, the highest Zn and Cr concentrations were determined to be 83.12 +/- 4.1 mu g/L in May at day 30 for Zn and 0.48 +/- 0.02 mu g/L in May at day 30 for Cr. The lowest Zn and Cr concentrations in summer season were 55.48 +/- 2.7 mu g/L at 30th day in August for Zn and 0.54 +/- 0.03 mu g/L at 10th day in June for Cr. The highest Zn and Cr concentration in summer season were found as 69.48 +/- 3.5 mu g/L in June at day 10 for Zn and 1.23 +/- 0.06 mu g/L in August at day 30 for Cr. The Zn and Cr concentrations in the downstream of Uzuncayir Dam were found to be smaller than the Zn and Cr concentrations given by the Surface Water Quality Regulation (SWQR). As a result, it was determined that there was no harm in using water from the Uzuncayir Dam as irrigation water or drinking water in terms of Zn and Cr concentrations.

J	LAMPERT, W; TAYLOR, BE				LAMPERT, W; TAYLOR, BE			ZOOPLANKTON GRAZING IN A EUTROPHIC LAKE - IMPLICATIONS OF DIEL VERTICAL MIGRATION	ECOLOGY												During summer and fall, depth profiles of zooplankton community grazing were determined in situ during day and night in the Schoehsee, a small eutrophic lake. Labeled algae of 2 different sizes were mixed with the natural suspension of phytoplankton in a grazing chamber. A small blue-green alga (Synechococcus, 1 .mu.m) was labeled with 32P; a larger green alga (Scenedesmus, 4-15 .mu.m) was labeled with 14C. Grazing and vertical migration of zooplankton were strongly coupled. During summer, grazing in the upper 5 m was negligible during day, but was strong at night. Algae grow relatively unimpeded by grazing during daytime, but are harvested at night. Vertical and diel differences in grazing rates disappeared when the vertical migration ceased in fall. Selectivity of grazing was controlled by the zooplankton species composition. Eudiaptomus showed a strong preference for Scenedesmus (electivity index D = 0.9). Daphnia showed a slight preference for Scenedesmus, but Ceriodaphnia preferred Synechococcus. Cyclopoid copepodites did not ingest the small blue-green. Because Daphnia and Eudiaptomus were dominant, grazing rates on larger cells were usually higher than grazing rates on the small cells. Negative electivity indices for Scenedesmus occurred only when the biomass of large crustaceans was extremely low (near the surface, during day). Zooplankton biomass was the main factor controlling both vertical and seasonal variations in grazing. Highest grazing rates (65%/day) were measured during fall, when zooplankton abundance was high. Differences between day and night in the grazing activity per unit biomass were not statistically significant. Laboratory experiments showed considerable losses of tracer from preserved animals, and loss rates differed for the 2 radioisotopes. Because such differential losses can produce substantial errors in the results, it was necessary to process the samples on the boat immediately after collection, without preservation.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1985	66	1					68	82		10.2307/1941307	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1941307													WOS:A1985ABS6200007

In addition to mantle-derived CO2, the oxidation of organic matter was prevalent in shallow groundwater during the summer. Their associated degassing of CO2 produced higher pCO(2) values than in autumn or winter and elevated C-13(DIC) values. In summer, DIC in the epilimnion showed a wide range of C-13(DIC) from -8.4 to 2.6 parts per thousand. Waters in open-lake areas with relatively positive C-13(DIC) values and the low levels of pCO(2) were primarily influenced by CO2 degassing. Photosynthesis elevated the C-13(DIC) values and led to minimal pCO(2) levels in closed lake areas. Isotopically, C-13(org) was found to be positively related to C-13(SOC). In addition, lake bed sediments generally had lower concentrations and larger C-13 values of organic carbon than the surrounding soils. These results suggest that (CO2)-C-12 derived from the degradation of sediment was preferentially utilized by phytoplankton in the epilimnion during photosynthesis. The remaining C-13-rich organic matter was retained in the sediment. Since 2000, C-13(org) increased in lake 3 over time, reflecting the input of sewage and land use changes associated with a resort used for tourism. The values of C-13(org) in lake 5, distant from the resort, did not change substantially, indicating minimal human impacts.					; jia, Jessie/IVV-4808-2023	Gao, Cuiping/0000-0001-9156-0430; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2019	26	3					2918	2928		10.1007/s11356-018-3840-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-3840-y								30499091					WOS:000456198400075
J	Lang, C; Jaeger, RG				Lang, C; Jaeger, RG			Defense of territories by male-female pairs in the Red-Backed Salamander (Plethodon cinereus)	COPEIA												Both adult males and females of the Red-Backed Salamander (Plethodon cinereus) maintain feeding territories under cover objects (rocks and logs on the forest Boor) during the summer noncourtship and autumn and spring courtship seasons. Previous research found that, during the summer, 28% of the adults occurred as male-female pairs under cover objects, whereas male-male and female-female pairs rarely occurred. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that male-female pairs codefense territories against intruders during the courtship season and that such codefense extends into the noncourtship summer. During October 1996 and June 1997, we collected male-female pairs, single males, and single females at Mountain Lake Biological Station, Virginia. In laboratory experiments, we employed six randomized treatments during: the courtship season (n = 27 pairs) but only the first two treatments during the noncourtship season (n = 29 pairs). The treatments were the male-female pair confronting (1) a single male intruder and (2) a single female intruder, the male resident alone confronting (3) a single male intruder and (4) a single female intruder, and the female resident alone confronting (5) a single male intruder and (6) a single female intruder. During the courtship season, intruding males did not spend significantly different amounts of time on territories defended by a male-female pair versus territories defended by a single salamander (male or female) from the pair. However, during the courtship season intruding females did spend significantly less time on territories defended by a male-female pair versus territories defended by a single salamander (male or female) from the pair, hlale and female intruders spent significantly less time on territories defended by a pair during the courtship season compared to the noncourtship season. During both the courtship and noncourtship seasons, males in pairs spent significantly more time in aggression toward intruding males than did their female partners, and females in pairs spent significantly more time in aggression toward intruding females than did their partners. Thus, our experiment suggests that male-female pairs as residents can codefend territories but not in a cooperative manner. Because paired male residents were more aggressive to male intruders, whereas paired female residents were more aggressive to female intruders, we suggest that males in pairs may not be willing to pass up future polygynous relationships, and females in pairs may not be willing to pass up future polyandrous relationships.																			0045-8511					FEB 1	2000		1					169	177		10.1643/0045-8511(2000)2000[0169:DOTBMF]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1643/0045-8511(2000)2000[0169:DOTBMF]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000085186900016

J	MAKAREWICZ, JC				MAKAREWICZ, JC			PHYTOPLANKTON BIOMASS AND SPECIES COMPOSITION IN LAKE ERIE, 1970 TO 1987	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Phytoplankton were collected at offshore sites during 33 cruises in the spring, summer, and autumn from 1983 to 1987. Forty-nine common species and varieties accounted for 83.3% of the total abundance and 83.1% of the biomass. Over the 5-year study period, the phytoplankton biomass (mean +/- S.E.) of the western, central and eastern basins averaged 1.88 +/- 0.12 g/m3, 1.04 +/- 0.075 g/m3, and 0.63 + 0.071 g/m3, respectively. Depending on the basin, a 52 to 89% reduction in mean weighted algal biomass had occurred in the offshore waters of Lake Erie between 1970 and 1983-87. The historically highly productive western basin had a consistent decrease in biomass from 1958 to 1987. In general, occurrences of common species in 1970 and 1983-87 were similar. However, dramatic decreases in the abundances of many nuisance and eutrophic species were evident. A 70 to 98% reduction in biomass of Stephanodiscus binderanus, S. niagarae, S. tenuis, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, and Rhodomonas minuta was observed. The decrease in biomass of the nuisance and eutrophic indicator species, the reappearance of mesotrophic species, such as Asterionella formosa and Rhizosolenia eriensis, common in the 1940s and 1950s, and the decrease in total phytoplankton biomass suggest a major improvement in the offshore waters of Lake Erie.																			0380-1330						1993	19	2					258	274		10.1016/S0380-1330(93)71216-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(93)71216-2													WOS:A1993LN30700008

Water and solutes penetrate the burrow walls and are transported into/out of the sediment when organisms flush their burrows with overlying water. Few studies have been done to investigate bioirrigation under shifting environmental conditions. We experimentally quantified bioirrigation by Chironomus plumosus larvae in the laboratory at 3 ranges of O-2 saturation (low, medium, and high O-2 concentrations), 2 temperatures (10 and 20 degrees C), and over different seasons. We measured ventilation activities with O-2 and flow-velocity microsensors, flow velocities during pumping periods with color tracers, pumping rates with conductivity exchange experiments, and rates of advective and diffusive water influx into the sediment by influx assays (NaCl was the tracer in both latter experiments). O-2 saturations <12% extended pumping durations/h, whereas saturations <3% decreased pumping durations to similar to 0. Flow velocities were 2x higher when O-2 saturation was >50% than when it was <10%. Rising temperatures altered larval pumping (higher pumping frequency, lower pumping length) and increased flow velocity. Hence, pumping rate and rates of water influx were significantly higher at 20 than at 10 degrees C. Seasonal variations in bioirrigation occurred despite constant laboratory conditions, i.e., the rate of water influx was significantly higher in spring/summer than in autumn. Our study shows that temporally varying environmental conditions should be considered when evaluating bioirrigation-mediated benthic fluxes across the sediment-water interface.

An HPAI virus, A/northern pintail/Hokkaido/M13/2020 (H5N8) (NP/Hok/20) belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b, was isolated from a fecal sample collected at a lake in Hokkaido, Japan where migratory birds rested, October 2020. In the phylogenetic trees of all eight gene segments, NP/Hok/20 fell into in the cluster of European isolates in 2020, but was distinct from the isolates in eastern Asia and Europe during the winter season of 2017-2018. The antigenic cartography indicates that the antigenicity of NP/Hok/20 was almost the same as that of previous isolates of H5 clade 2.3.4.4b, whereas the antigenic distances from NP/Hok/20 to the representative strains in clade 2.3.4.4e and to a strain in 2.3.4 were apparently distant. These data imply that HPAI virus clade 2.3.4.4b should have been delivered by bird migration despite the intercontinental distance, although it was not defined whether NP/Hok/20 was transported from Europe via Siberia where migratory birds nest in the summer season. Given the probability of perpetuation of transmission in the northern territory, periodic updates of intensive surveys on avian influenza at the global level are essential to prepare for future outbreaks of the HPAI virus.

The relationships of runoff, water level, water temperature, and anoxia to the annual and seasonal total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) retentions of a headwater Sphagnum-conifer swamp during 1987-1988 were examined. Annual retentions of TP (4%) and TN (10%) were low in the swamp. On an annual basis, inputs exceeded outputs of total reactive P, NO3-N, and NH4-N and outputs exceeded inputs of total unreactive P and total organic N. Seasonal trends in P and N retention were inversely correlated with runoff. Positive monthly retention coincided with low runoff and increased biotic assimilation during the growing season. Water table drawdown during the summer was associated with peat aeration and increased levels of P and N in surface and pore water. High levels of P and N in the swamp surface water during the fall and winter were coupled with increased runoff, saturated overland flow, and potentially low biotic assimilation resulting in a net release of TP and TN. Large flow through of waterborne inputs and flushing of regenerated P and N occurred during peak snowmelt runoff resulting in low annual retention.

LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Gaskill JA, Woller-Skar MM. 2018. Do invasive dreissenid mussels influence spatial and temporal patterns of toxic Microcystis aeruginosa in a low-nutrient Michigan lake? Lake Reserv Manage. 00:00-00.Invasive dreissenid mussels enable harmful Microcystis blooms in low-nutrient lakes not historically accustomed to high cyanobacteria densities. Here, we examined patterns in Microcystis and microcystin spatially across Little Traverse Lake, Michigan, and temporally over the course of the lake's bloom. Because Microcystis spends part of its life cycle in the sediment, we included benthic and surface densities in our study. We also looked at the spatial relationship between dreissenid biomass and Microcystis density using local and global statistics and found that the clear relationship previously demonstrated to exist between these 2 taxa on the lake scale does not seem to be maintained on a finer, site scale. Distributions of Microcystis (surface and benthic) and microcystin in the lake were largely random and we observed no link between dreissenid biomass and Microcystis density. This suggests that either these taxa are not related on the site scale, or that environmental factors have a greater influence on localized Microcystis distributions than the location of dreissenid beds. Finally, we observed highest densities of surface Microcystis during mid-summer and highest densities of benthic Microcystis in the fall. This is consistent with Microcystis's life history in many temperate lakes: densities increase to their highest levels in late summer and decline into autumn as temperatures drop and colonies sink to the sediment. As invasive dreissenids continue to spread, knowing how they will affect harmful algae will be vital to bloom mitigation.

The results were as follows. 1. Phytoplankton in the Broad Lough were unlikely to be nutrient-limited; winter soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations of c. 35mug P l-1 were rarely depleted to less than 10mug P l-1 by spring and summer phytoplankton, the annual nitrate minima were greater-than-or-equal-to 130mug N l-1, and the soluble reactive silica minima were greater-than-or-equal-to 0.4mg SiO2 l-1. 2. Light attenuation was high owing to water colour and non-algal particulates, with ratios of photic zone volume and mixed depth volume close to 0.2. Variations in the mixed depth between years owing to temperature stratification had little influence on the underwater light regime and could not be related to inter-annual differences in mean summer chlorophyll a which ranged between 3mug and 15mug l-1. 3. Total phosphorus concentration averaged 48.5mug P l-1 between 1985 and 1991 compared to 47.5mug P l-1 between 1974 and 1975. 4. Deoxygenation of the hypolimnion was insufficient to cause anoxia and year-to-year variations in dissolved oxygen of the hypolimnion were related to the duration of thermal stratification. There was no evidence to indicate that nutrient release from the sediment into the hypolimnion or into the lough as a whole was a significant factor in the nutrient balance of the lough.																			0791-7945					NOV	1993	93B	3					163	174																WOS:A1993NP69900007

The uptake rates of ammonium and nitrate were determined using N-15 methodology. N-2-fixation rates were measured by the acetylene-reduction technique. The light dependence of uptake and N-2-fixation was described with an exponential saturation equation. The decrease of I-k values from mid-summer to autumn coincided with an increasing contribution of cyanobacteria to the algal population, suggesting a relatively lower light requirement than that of other species. The dark uptake velocity of ammonium and nitrate were 30-63 % and 1-40 % of light saturated uptake, respectively. The contribution of ammonium to the daily nitrogen supply of algae varied between 50-90%. Nitrate uptake was much less important with a maximum of 40 %. Nitrogen fixation was significant only in the western basin at the time of highest primary production and greatest N-2-fixing cyanobacterial contribution. Nitrogen uptake experiments and loading data suggest, that nitrogen regeneration is by far the most important process in establishing and supporting the standing crop of phytoplankton in the lake during summer.

We investigated the photosynthetic rates of populations of this ciliate from two lakes, one in the Australian Capital Territory and the other on the New South Wales/Victorian border, in relation to photosynthesis by the whole phytoplankton community. The concentration of the ciliate varied between 192 and 4,267 cells liter(-1) during the study period of May-January (the austral winter, spring, and autumn) and it contributed between 4.3 and 69.3% of total plankton photosynthesis. Individual photosynthetic rates ranged between 1.03 +/- 0.8 and 3.98 +/- 0.6 ng C cell(-1) h(-1) and individual Chl a content between 925 +/- 62 to 1,461 +/- 63 pg cell(-1), giving assimilation numbers of 1.00-2.74. Light-response curves indicated that the ciliate achieved its highest rates of photosynthesis at high photon fluxes, typical of the surface waters. Vertical distribution patterns of Stenter in the water column of one of the lakes supported these physiological data. Southern hemisphere lakes seem to have a protozooplankton that may contain substantial numbers of a large ciliate capable of contributing a significant portion of carbon fixation in the plankton.

Responses of Estuarine Bacterioplankton, Phytoplankton and Zooplankton to Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) and Inorganic Nutrient Additions	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												The response of planktonic bacteria and phytoplankton to various additions of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as glucose, with and without inorganic nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), was tested in the upper to mid Hunter Estuary, Australia. In situ microcosms (1.25 L) were performed at two sites with varying salinities over three seasons. Analysis of variance showed a significant difference among control and treatments for all seasons for the bacterial, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a responses (P<0.05). A significant interaction between treatment and site was found in autumn for dissolved oxygen, autumn and spring for bacterial and spring for chlorophyll a responses. At both sites for each season, and on nearly all occasions, bacterial surface area was enhanced by DOC addition as indicated by both increased bacterial abundance and dissolved oxygen utilisation. DOC in combination with inorganic nutrients sometimes further enhanced the bacterial response compared to DOC alone. Inorganic nutrients alone did not enhance growth of the heterotrophic bacterioplankton. Addition of DOC alone led to decreased chlorophyll a relative to the control, probably due to competition for limited inorganic nutrients with the bacterioplankton DOC non-limiting conditions. Results suggest that the heterotrophic community was limited by DOC at both sites and across seasons. An experiment with a larger volume (70 L), performed over a longer time, compared a control with DOC addition. Increased bacterial biomass as a result of DOC addition occurred at day 2. Chlorophyll a did not significantly differ between treatments. An increase in zooplankton density was recorded in the DOC treatment relative to the control at day 10. This study supports the contention that increased DOC delivery with river inflows through environmental flow allocations will stimulate heterotrophic bacterioplankton production in the upper Hunter Estuary.

STOICHIOMETRIC COMPOSITION OF SESTON IN LITTORAL AND PELAGIAL ZONES OF SHALLOW LAKE OBSTERNO (BELARUS)	DOKLADY NATSIONALNOI AKADEMII NAUK BELARUSI												We estimated the seston elemental composition (C, N, P) and its ratio in pelagic and littoral zones of mesotrophic shallow Lake Obsterno during two contrasting seasons, as well as the influence of macrophyte beds on the seston stoichiometry. In the both pelagial and littoral zones in summer the C : N ratio was small, 4.62 and 7.05 respectively. But it increased slightly during autumn to 5.66 in pelagic samples against 8.33 in littoral ones. The large N : P ratio and the small phosphorus content specially in the macrophyte covered littoral zone equal to 57.7 in July against 22.47 in September suggest a high level of phosphorus limitation in the littoral locations as a possible mediated reason suppressing zooplankton abundance in summer. Our results in the both pelagial and littoral habitat showed a highly P limited situation in which the N : P ratio was larger in littoral with macrophyte than in pelagial zones. The obtained data of littoral seston stoichiometry were recorded for the first time and exceeded the classical Redfield ratio. The elemental imbalance between macrophyte covered littoral and pelagial suggest that nutrients, especially P, are more limiting in macrophyte beds in summer due to the resource competition between phytoplankton and macrophytes for nutrients, a poor food quality, low zooplankton abundance, as well as its poor taxon-specific elemental ratio in summer.

J	Gophen, M				Gophen, Moshe			Are Water Level Fluctuations and Pelagic Water Quality in Lake Kinneret Directly Related? Perspectives of Nutrient Dynamics	WATER												Long-term records of Water Level Fluctuations (WLF) and nutrient dynamics in Lake Kinneret have indicated an independence between them. The winter's high WLF with nutrient-rich conditions and the summer's low WLF with nutrient-poor conditions are recurrent states. Are Water Level Fluctuations and Lake Kinneret's pelagic water quality related directly or indirectly? Overall, the results found that WLF and nutrient dynamics in the pelagic zone of Lake Kinneret are not co-partners, but independent escorts. The common periodical (monthly) distribution of nutrient concentrations in the epilimnion of Lake Kinneret indicates that a 20 m deep epilimnion formed following a decline in water input, temperature, and evaporation elevation, resulting in the decline of WL. There was a seasonal correlation between summer's natural conditions and pelagic nutrients' deficiency. Low WL in summer is the result of natural subtropical climate conditions, whilst dry or high rainfall seasons induce water input modification and consequently, the WL decline of nutrient inputs and independent followers.

The great depth of Grand Lake, the availability of fine sediments along its tributaries and its important seasonal river inflow have favoured the formation of a 160-year-long clastic varved sequence. Each varve represents 1 hydrological year. Varve formation is mainly related to spring discharge conditions with contributions from summer and autumn rainfall events. The statistically significant relation between varve parameters and the Naskaupi River discharge observations provided the opportunity to develop local hydrological reconstructions beyond the instrumental period. The combined detrital layer thickness and the particle size (99th percentile) series extracted from each varve yield the strongest correlations with instrumental data (r = 0.68 and 0.75 respectively) and have been used to reconstruct the respective Naskaupi River mean and maximum annual discharges over the 1856-2016 period. The reconstructed Q-mean series suggest that high Q-mean years occurred during the 1920-1960 period, and a slight decrease in Q-mean took place during the second half of the 20th century. Independent reconstructions based on rainfall-runoff modelling of the watershed from historical reanalysis of global geopotential height fields display a significant correlation with the reconstructed Naskaupi River discharge based on varve physical parameters. The Grand Lake varved sequence contains a regional hydrological signal, as suggested by the statistically significant relation between the combined detrital layer thickness series and the observed Labrador region Q-mean series extracted from five watersheds of different sizes.					; Brigode, Pierre/B-7481-2014	Francus, Pierre/0000-0001-5465-1966; Gagnon-Poire, Antoine/0000-0003-0572-3606; Lajeunesse, Patrick/0000-0002-2265-4529; Brigode, Pierre/0000-0001-8257-0741													1814-9324	1814-9332				MAR 25	2021	17	2					653	673		10.5194/cp-17-653-2021	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-653-2021													WOS:000634737300001

Although they can be very abundant in karstic lotic freshwater habitats, there are still insufficient data on their biology and ecology. The family was studied over a period of 15 years in specific lotic habitats of springs and tufa barriers in the karst freshwater ecosystem of Plitvice Lakes NP, Croatia. Scirtidae showed a longitudinal gradient, as the genus Elodes was recorded only in the spring area, while the genus Hydrocyphon was found only in downstream sites with tufa barriers. Their emergence showed a seasonal character, with males dominating earlier in the season and females appearing later. The type of substrate determined their distribution, with a preference for bryophytes. Their abundance and emergence were primarily determined according to the parameters that showed the greatest fluctuations over the 15-year period: water discharge, water temperature and oxygen saturation. Compared to previous results from similar studies on other insect groups, our results clearly show the high potential of the family Scirtidae as indicators of habitat quality.Abstract Due to ongoing changes and a decline in biodiversity, science today should rely on long-term species-based ecological studies. We have conducted a long-term ecological dynamics study on the water beetle family Scirtidae, which, although it is very abundant in benthic communities, is still poorly studied. The main objective of this study was to investigate the population aspects (composition, diversity, sex ratio) and ecological aspects (emergence patterns, seasonal dynamics and preferences for environmental factors) of the family Scirtidae over 15 years in Plitvice Lakes NP, Croatia. The study was conducted at three sites and in five different substrate types. A total of three taxa with different distributions were recorded in the study area: Hydrocyphon novaki and H. deflexicollis on the tufa barriers and the Elodes sp. in the spring area. The sex ratio was in favour of males in spring and early summer, while it shifted in favour of females towards the end of autumn. The abundance and emergence of the family were primarily determined by the environmental parameters which showed the greatest fluctuations over a period of 15 years: water temperature, water discharge and oxygen saturation. Our results clearly show that Scirtidae can be used as indicators of stream zonation and habitat quality. Based on the methodology and the results of this study, we conclude that Scirtidae should be used in future monitoring and protection measures in karst freshwater habitats in southeastern Europe.					; Ivković, Marija/AAB-1756-2020; Stankovic, Vlatka/AAY-6001-2021	Ivkovic, Marija/0000-0003-3188-5676; Micetic Stankovic, Vlatka/0000-0002-6434-8757; Klarin, Ana/0009-0009-2225-6983														2075-4450				APR	2024	15	4							226	10.3390/insects15040226	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects15040226								38667356					WOS:001209911900001
J	Yang, CH; Wang, GX; Yin, HB				Yang, Chunhui; Wang, Guoxiang; Yin, Hongbin			Combining dredging with modified zeolite thin-layer capping to control nitrogen release from eutrophic lake sediment	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Dredging is widely used to control internal sediment nitrogen (N) pollution during eutrophic lake restoration. However, the effectiveness of dredging cannot be maintained for long periods during seasonal temperature variations. This study used modified zeolite (MZ) as a thin-layer capping material to enhance dredging efficiency during a year-long field sediment core incubation period. Our results showed that dredging alone more effectively reduced pore water N, N flux, and sediment N content than MZ capping but showed more dramatic changes during the warm seasons. The N flux in dredged sediment in summer was 1.8 and 2.5 times that in spring and autumn, respectively, indicating a drastic N regeneration process in the short term. In contrast, the combination method reduced the extra 10% pore water N, 22% N flux, and 8% sediment organic N content compared with dredging alone and maintained high stability during seasonal changes. The results indicated that the addition of MZ to the surface of dredged sediment not only enhanced the control effect of dredging by its adsorption capacity but may also smooth the N regeneration process via successive accumulation (in the channel of the material) and activation of bacteria for months, which was evidenced by the variation in microbial diversity in the MZ treatment. As a result, the combination of dredging with modified zeolite simultaneously enhanced the efficiency and stability of the single dredging method in controlling sediment N content and its release, exhibiting great prospects for long-term application in eutrophic lakes with severe pollution from internal N loading.

Lake, wetland, and river sampling were conducted by helicopter during late summer, capturing conditions close to peak evaporative enrichment. Shallow soil water from the unsaturated zone was also collected in late summer, whereas deeper groundwaters from Quaternary aquifers, Quaternary channels, and uppermost Cretaceous strata, were collected primarily as part of winter drilling programs by industrial partners. Snowpack samples were collected in late March/early April, prior to significant spring melt. This dataset includes 1576 isotopic analyses made on 788 water samples as well as selected isotope mass balance model outputs (lake evaporation/inflow and water yield to lakes). These basic model data are provided to facilitate evaluation of the method as a tool for spatial mapping of water yield and its interannual variability. Details and further discussion on the isotope mass balance approach are provided in "Mapping water yield distribution across the southern Athabasca Oil Sands area: baseline surveys applying isotope mass balance of lakes" (Gibson et al., 2019). Overall, the data are expected to be useful, in comparison with local and regional datasets, for water resource management and planning, including design of monitoring networks and environmental impact assessments for oil sands projects.

J	Livinstone, DM; Lotter, AF; Kettle, H				Livinstone, DM; Lotter, AF; Kettle, H			Altitude-dependent differences in the primary physical response of mountain lakes to climatic forcing	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Simultaneous hourly measurements of lake surface water temperature (LSWT) during summer and early autumn 2000 in 29 lakes in the Swiss Alps revealed the presence of two altitudinally distinct thermal regimes. The threshold separating the low-altitude from the high-altitude regime was located at similar to 2,000 m above sea level during early summer 2000 but rose as summer progressed. Within the low-altitude regime, LSWTs are strongly related to altitude and surface air temperature. On crossing the threshold to the high-altitude regime, the LSWT lapse rate increases sharply, but the relationship of LSWT to both altitude and air temperature weakens considerably. A difference in the response of low-altitude and high-altitude mountain lakes to climatic forcing in early summer may have implications for climate change studies in which mountain lakes are employed either for paleoclimate reconstructions or as sensitive indicators of current climate change. Any long-term temporal change in the threshold altitude would imply that lakes close to the threshold may not always have been located in the same thermal regime, with consequences for paleolimnological climate reconstructions. Predictions of the effects of future climate warming on high-altitude mountain lakes may have to take into account the possibility of a concomitant rise in the threshold altitude.

The annual degree-days above freezing for the five years were 9.7, 37.7, 22.4, 7.0, and 48.8, respectively, with summer (DJF) accounting for virtually all of this. For these five summers the average DJF temperatures were -3.5 degrees, -1.9 degrees, -2.2 degrees, -2.6 degrees, and -2.5 degrees C. The maximum (minimum) temperatures were +5.3 degrees, +7.6 degrees, +5.7 degrees, +4.4 degrees, and +9.0 degrees C (-13.8 degrees, -12.8 degrees, -12.9 degrees, -13.5 degrees, and -12.1 degrees C). The average of the wind speed recorded was 5.4 m s(-1), the maximum was 35.7 m s(-1), and the average daily maximum was 15 m s(-1). The wind speed was higher in the winter, averaging 6.4 m s(-1). Summer winds averaged 4.7 m s(-1). The dominant wind direction for strong winds is from the south for all seasons, with a secondary source of strong winds in the summer from the east-northeast. Relative humidity averages 37%; however, high values will occur with an average period of ~10 days, providing a strong indicator of the quasi-periodic passage of storms across the site. Low summer temperatures and high wind speeds create conditions at the surface of the lake ice resulting in sublimation rather than melting as the main mass-loss process.					; Andersen, Dale/B-4816-2013	McKay, Christopher/0000-0002-6243-1362; Andersen, Dale/0000-0001-8827-1259													1558-8424	1558-8432				JUL	2015	54	7					1393	1412		10.1175/JAMC-D-14-0251.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-14-0251.1													WOS:000357998100002

As such, climatic changes that alter snowmelt properties and timing will have cascading impacts on the hydrological system as the Arctic warms. Geochemical tracers provide a tool to characterize the various processes governing the seasonal evolution of the snowpack; however, a lack of snow observations from a variety of Arctic landscapes limits the broad applicability of such tracers and further impedes our understanding of the various processes governing snowpack evolution and its ultimate contribution to the spring discharge peak. This study aims to gain a better understanding of the spatial distribution and the temporal evolution of the natural stable isotope signatures of snow from two distinct ecoregions: open tundra and taiga. More specifically, we describe the geophysical and stable isotope properties of the snow cover at Wekweeti (Northwest Territories), a high sub-Arctic taiga site, and within the Greiner Lake Watershed, near Cambridge Bay (Nunavut), an open Arctic tundra site. Results illustrate a link between snowpack formation and stable isotope distributions at both study sites. Stable oxygen isotope ratios of snow (delta O-18-H2O) show a wide range from -41% to -17% across all snow depth classes; however, heavy isotope enrichment is clearly visible in the bottom snow layers at both sites. Vapour flux from the ground under a strong temperature gradient is considered to be the main driver for this enrichment due to kinetic metamorphism, which is more prominent at the open tundra site. The stable isotope signatures of the bottom hoar layers during winter were found to be similar to river water values sampled during spring and summer, highlighting the need for more in-depth hydrological cycle assessment.																			0705-5900	1480-9214				MAY 27	2021	59	3					137	151		10.1080/07055900.2021.1962240	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07055900.2021.1962240													WOS:000686785800001
J	Adrian, R				Adrian, R			Calanoid-cyclopoid interactions: evidence from an 11-year field study in a eutrophic lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The interactions between calanoid and cyclopoid copepods were examined in a 2. A diminishing ratio of calanoids to cyclopoids was observed. The responses, however, were species specific. While two cyclopoid species responded with increased populations (Cyclops vicinus, Thermocyclops oithonoides), one species exhibited marked declines (C. kolensis). Other species extended the duration of their pelagic phase (Mesocyclops leuckarti, Diacyclops bicuspidatus, T. oithonoides, C. vicinus), leading to higher population overlaps. Eudiaptomus graciloides and E. gracilis, which used to be present throughout the year, were more frequently absent. 3. These changes coincided with a series of mild winters during which prey availability (algae and rotifers) was high. 4. Enhanced prey availability, in conjunction with a flexible diapausing strategy, are hypothesized to underly the increased success of C, vicinus. Predatory losses due to early occurrence and enhanced abundances of C. vicinus, rather than competition for the same food resources, are hypothesized to be responsible for the declines of C. kolensis and Eudiaptomus. 5. Summer species tended to develop higher abundances early in the season, which led to enhanced seasonal means during spring. These changes cannot be explained by the interaction between calanoids and cyclopoids alone, but were probably a result of changes in fish predation.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				OCT	1997	38	2					315	325		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1997.00215.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1997.00215.x													WOS:A1997YF50700007
J	Matthews, R; Hilles, M; Pelletier, G				Matthews, R; Hilles, M; Pelletier, G			Determining trophic state in Lake Whatcom, Washington (USA), a soft water lake exhibiting seasonal nitrogen limitation	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We evaluated an eleven year data set to assess trophic state and nutrient limitation in Lake Whatcom, an oligotrophic, soft water, chain lake located in the Puget Sound lowlands of Washington (U.S.A.). Although total phosphorus (TP) and soluble reactive phosphate (SRP) concentrations were relatively low throughout the lake, there were significant differences between the northern basin (Site 1) and the other sampling sites (Sites 2-4). Nonparametric correlation coefficients (Kendall's tau(beta)) were highest between chlorophyll (CHL), Secchi depth (SD), total nitrogen (TN), and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN). Late summer algal biomass correlated best with DIN and TP. Trophic State Indices based on TP, TN, CHL and SD revealed that although algal growth was most likely phosphorus limited throughout the year, the northern basin of the lake may have developed nitrogen co-limitation during late summer and fall. During this period, N/P ratios were often less than 20, and in 1998 the epilimnetic DIN concentrations dropped below 20 mug l(-1) while DIN/TP ratios fell below 4. Reviews of the literature suggest that while co-limitation by phosphorus and nitrogen is fairly common in unproductive lakes, the patterns seen in Lake Whatcom were more similar to those reported for eutrophic lakes experiencing secondary nitrogen limitation resulting from excess phosphorus loading.

J	Truman, PS; van den Hurk, P				Truman, Pamela S.; van den Hurk, Peter			Xenoestrogen Exposure and Effects in Bluegill from the Reedy River, South Carolina, USA	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Water quality in the Reedy River basin of Greenville, South Carolina, has been impacted by diverse and highly urbanized land uses. It has been demonstrated that urban runoff and point sources, such as effluent from wastewater treatment facilities, introduce organic pollutants and potentially endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) into the watershed. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential toxicological effects of EDCs that may be present in the Reedy River watershed using a set of biomarkers measured in indigenous fish to characterize the exposure and biological effects of these contaminants. Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) were collected during three different sampling seasons (spring, summer, and fall) from several sites along the length of the Reedy River and from an unimpacted site at Lake Robinson. Fish were analyzed for xenoestrogenic exposure (estrogenic effect of bile extracts) and effects (vitellogenin production in juvenile fish), which were compared to the hepatosomatic index as a general health parameter. Samples downstream of Greenville, especially downstream of the wastewater treatment facilities, were found to have significantly higher levels of estrogenic activity in bile extracts, which correlated well with elevated plasma vitellogenin concentrations relative to the specimens collected in reference sites. The results provide evidence that bluegill in the Reedy River were exposed to elevated concentrations of xenoestrogenic compounds and that these xenoestrogens were bioavailable, resulting in biological effects.					van den Hurk, Peter/AFQ-0516-2022	van den Hurk, Peter/0000-0002-8131-0996													0090-4341	1432-0703				JAN	2010	58	1					165	175		10.1007/s00244-009-9337-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-009-9337-4								19488802					WOS:000273665000018

Although Chl-a is often used as a proxy for ACD, its accuracy requires validation, and studies on their linear correlation are scarce. Additionally, Chl-a and ACD are influenced by various factors, including nutritional, economic, biochemical, physicochemical, and meteorological factors. However, the relative importance of these factors on Chl-a and ACD remains insufficiently studied. This study analyzed data from 57 lakes and reservoirs across China from March 2021 to February 2023, investigating the distribution patterns of Chl-a and ACD across different regions and seasons. The study employed a linear regression model to explore the correlation between Chl-a and ACD in various regions and seasons throughout China. Furthermore, Mantel test and generalized linear model were used to evaluated the relative importance of nutritional factors (total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), TN/TP ratio (TN/TP), and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N)), economic factors (gross domestic product), meteorological factors (surface pressure, net solar radiation, air temperature, wind speed (WS), and rainfall (RF)), as well as biochemical and physicochemical factors (turbidity (TUR), pH value, water temperature (WT), permanganate index, and dissolved oxygen) on Chl-a and ACD. Results showed that the average concentrations of Chl-a and ACD in South China were highest, at 12 mu g/L and 19.5 x 106 cells/L, respectively. Seasonally, Chl-a peaked in spring and was lowest in winter, while ACD peaked in summer and was lowest in winter. Significant seasonal and regional variations in the Chl-a and ACD correlation were observed, with spring showing the strongest relationship. In Central China, Chl-a and ACD were significantly correlated throughout the four seasons, whereas correlations were less distinct in Eastern and Western regions. Therefore, Chl-a as a proxy for ACD requires caution. Nutrient factors (TN, TP, TN/TP, NH3-N) were identified as the primary drivers of Chl-a and ACD. Meteorological factors (WS, RF), along with biochemical and physicochemical factors (WT, TUR) also emerged as critical predictors of Chl-a and ACD, with spatial variations. This study validates Chl-a as a proxy for ACD, analyzes their spatiotemporal distribution, and assesses the influence of various factors on Chl-a and ACD, enhancing our understanding of algal dynamics in Chinese lakes and reservoirs.

In August 1994, 18% of the total plant biomass was removed in a radial pattern of 2-m-wide channels in Fish Lake, Dane County, Wisconsin. After the vegetation removal, winter angler hours increased significantly, whereas summer angler hours did not. The number of bout trips in summer increased significantly, but the number of shore trips did not. Catch rates and total catch of bluegills did not change significantly, but the size structure of harvested bluegills increased, Catches of bluegills by shore anglers decreased in summer, whereas catches of bluegills by bout anglers increased, Natural mortality declined for bluegills of ages 4-6, but fishing mortality more than doubled for bluegills of the same ages. We conclude that removal of Eurasian watermilfoil may increase winter angler effort, decrease natural mortality of bluegills, and increase fishing mortality of bluegills. We also conclude that removing vegetation may improve the quality of the bluegill Fishery, as evidenced by the increase in the number of larger bluegills harvested. However. this study lacked the replication and controls needed to separate the effects of plant harvesting from those of other biotic and abiotic factors.

Photosynthetic efficiency as a function of thermal stratification and phytoplankton size structure in an oligotrophic alpine lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA					14th Workshop of the International-Association-of-Phytoplankton-Taxonomy-and-Ecology	SEP 04-11, 2005	Sapanca, TURKEY	Int Assoc Phytoplankton Taxon & Ecol				Allometric relationships of phytoplankton communities were studied on the basis of a five-year data-set in a deep oligotrophic alpine lake in Austria. The seasonal phytoplankton succession in Mondsee is characterised by diatoms during winter mixing and a distinct metalimnetic population of Planktothrix rubescens during stratification in summer. The variation of phytoplankton photosynthetic efficiency between seasons was assessed using in situ carbon-uptake rates (5 years data) and Fast Repetition Rate Fluorometry (FRRF) (2 years data). The light-saturated, chlorophyll-specific rate of photosynthesis (P*(max)), irradiance at the onset of saturation (E(k)) and maximum light-utilisation efficiency (alpha*) were determined for winter mixing and summer stratification. Fluorescence-based parameters as the functional absorption cross section of Photosystem II (sigma (PSII)) and the photochemical quantum yield (F(v)/F(m)) were additionally analysed in 2003 and 2004 to study the underlying physiological mechanisms for the variability in photosynthetic performance. Beyond their sensitivity to changing environmental conditions like thermal stratification, phytoplankton populations differ in their photosynthetic behaviour according to their size structure. Therefore Photosynthesis vs. Irradiance (P/E)-relationships were analysed in detail within a 1-year period from size fractionated cell counts, chlorophyll-a and carbon-uptake.					; Teubner, Katrin/AAC-1224-2021; Dokulil, Martin/J-3464-2019	Dokulil, Martin/0000-0002-6369-1457; Teubner, Katrin/0000-0002-3699-2043													0018-8158					MAR	2007	578	1					29	36		10.1007/s10750-006-0430-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0430-7													WOS:000244308300004

Yet, the C dynamics of wetlands and floodplains are poorly defined and field data is scarce. Air-water CO2 fluxes in the wetlands of Donana Natural Area (SW Spain) were examined by measuring alkalinity, pH and other physiochemical parameters in a range of water bodies during 2010-2011. Areal fluxes were calculated and, using remote sensing, an estimate of the contribution of aquatic habitats to gaseous CO2 transport was derived. Semi-permanent ponds adjacent to the large Guadalquivir estuary acted as mild sinks, whilst temporal wetlands were strong sources of CO2 (-0.8 and 36.3 mmol(CO2) m(-2) d(-1)). Fluxes in semi-permanent streams and ponds changed seasonally; acting as sources in spring-winter and mild sinks in autumn (16.7 and -1.2 mmol(CO2) m(-2) d(-1)). Overall, Donana's water bodies were a net annual source of CO2 (5.2 mol(C) m(-2) y(-1)). Up-scaling clarified the overwhelming contribution of seasonal flooding and allochthonous organic matter inputs in determining regional air-water gaseous CO2 transport (13.1 Gg(C) y(-1)). Nevertheless, this estimate is about 6 times < local marsh net primary production, suggesting the system acts as an annual net CO2 sink. Initial indications suggest longer hydroperiods may favour autochthonous C capture by phytoplankton. Direct anthropogenic impacts have reduced the hydroperiod in Donana and this maybe exacerbated by climate change (less rainfall and more evaporation), suggesting potential for the modification of C sequestration.

Transformation of dissolved organic matter and related trace elements in the mouth zone of the largest European Arctic river: experimental modeling	INLAND WATERS					6th International Vereshchagin Baikal Conference	SEP, 2015	Inst Limnol, Irkutsk, RUSSIA		Inst Limnol			The relationship between dissolved organic matter (DOM) and heterotrophic bacterioplankton controls the ecological status of freshwater ecosystems and the fate of metals in aquatic environments. To improve our understanding of physicochemical and biological processes controlling the DOC and related trace elements in the Arctic estuary, we conducted experiments of the biodegradation and physicochemical coagulation of DOM and associated trace elements. For the experiments, water from the estuarine zone of the Severnaya Dvina River in Russia, the largest pristine European Arctic river, was mixed with sterile river water from the freshwater zone, sampled during spring flood in June and summer base flow in August. We revealed a lack of transformation of allochthonous organic matter in spring and measurable degradation of more autochthonous DOM in summer. According to their behavior during incubation experiments, several groups of trace metals were distinguished, comprising (1) nonconservative Fe, Mn, Al, trivalent (Ga, Y, rare earth elements) and tetravalent (Ti, Zr, Hf, Th) hydrolysates, subjected to significant removal from solution, especially at low salinities (0.5-2.5%); and (2) divalent metals such as Ba, Cd, and Pb, subjected to desorption from suspended particulate matter. The trace elements present in the form of oxyanions and neutral molecules (B, Si, As, Sb, Mo) and alkalis (Rb) exhibited highly conservative behavior with negligible removal from the freshwater-seawater mixtures. The spring flood, providing the largest contribution to the annual riverine flux to the ocean, demonstrated high stability of freshwater dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and divalent metals (Cu, Zn, Ni, Cd) to both physicochemical coagulation and biodegradation. This may imply a less significant transformation of the riverine DOC and metal micronutrients delivery to the Arctic Ocean compared to a traditional estuarine removal scheme.					; Chupakov, Artem/A-9191-2014; Chupakova, Anna/A-8276-2014; Pokrovsky, Oleg/W-4934-2019	Cupakova, Anna/0000-0001-8234-3514; Chupakov, Artem/0000-0001-6424-5582; Pokrovsky, Oleg/0000-0002-3155-7069; 													2044-2041	2044-205X					2017	7	3					272	282		10.1080/20442041.2017.1329907	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2017.1329907													WOS:000412646100005

Lake Ontario zooplankton in 2003 and 2008: Community changes and vertical redistribution	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Lake-wide zooplankton surveys are critical for documenting and understanding food web responses to ecosystem change. Surveys in 2003 and 2008 during the binational intensive field year in Lake Ontario found that offshore epilimnetic crustacean zooplankton declined by a factor of 12 (density) and factor of 5 (biomass) in the summer with smaller declines in the fall. These declines coincided with an increase in abundance of Bythotrephes and are likely the result of direct predation by, or behavioral responses to this invasive invertebrate predator. Whole water column zooplankton density also declined from 2003 to 2008 in the summer and fall (factor of 4), but biomass only declined in the fall (factor of 2). The decline in biomass was less than the decline in density because the average size of individual zooplankton increased. This was due to changes in the zooplankton community composition from a cyclopoid/bosminid dominated community in 2003 to a calanoid dominated community in 2008. The increase in calanoid copepods was primarily due to the larger species Limnocalanus macrurus and Leptodiaptomus sicilis. These cold water species were found in and below the thermocline associated with a deep chlorophyll layer. In 2008, most of the zooplankton biomass resided in or below the thermocline during the day. Increased importance of copepods in deeper, colder water may favor Cisco and Rainbow Smelt over Alewife because these species are better adapted to cold temperatures than Alewife.					; Weidel, Brian/LFR-6469-2024	Rudstam, Lars/0000-0002-3732-6368; 													1463-4988	1539-4077					2015	18	1					43	62		10.1080/14634988.2014.965121	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634988.2014.965121													WOS:000351695400006

John			Chironomid-inferred summer temperatures for the Last Glacial-Interglacial Transition from a lake sediment sequence in Muir Park Reservoir, west-central Scotland	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Lake sediments spanning the Last Glacial-Interglacial Transition (LGIT: ca. 14.7 to 8 ka BP) from Muir Park Reservoir (MPR) in west-central Scotland were analysed for chironomids. The site lies just outside the southern limit of a former glacier that advanced into the Loch Lomond Basin during the Loch Lomond (Younger Dryas) Stadial. Chironomid-inferred mean July temperatures were derived using a modern Norwegian calibration dataset. Three tephra layers constrain the sequence chronologically. Inferred temperatures decline from a high value early in the Interstadial, punctuated by two cold oscillations, probably equivalent to GI-1d and GI-1b in the Greenland ice-core record, and a warm oscillation (equivalent to GI-1a) immediately before the severe cooling at the start of the Loch Lomond Stadial (GS-1), when summer temperatures fell by about 5 degrees C below the Interstadial average. Summer temperatures fell by about 3 degrees C below the Interstadial average during GI-1d, which is less severe than inferred from other chironomid records from eastern Scotland, and may reflect the influence of an oceanic-continental gradient. Cooling during GI-1b was particularly strong at MPR when minimum temperatures were about the same as those reached during GI-1d, unlike other sites investigated where GI-1d is usually between 1 and 2 degrees C cooler than GI-1b.

The insoluble phosphate in the sediment is converted into soluble phosphate, facilitating mass reproduction of algae. Therefore, studying the diversity of gcd genes which encode GDH is beneficial to reveal the microbial group that has a significant influence on the eutrophication of water. Taking the eutrophic Sancha Lake sediments as the research object, we acquired samples from six sites in the spring and autumn. A total of 219,778 high-quality sequences were obtained by DNA extraction of microbial groups in sediments, PCR amplification of the gcd gene, and high-throughput sequencing. Six phyla, nine classes, 15 orders, 29 families, 46 genera, and 610 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were determined, suggesting the high genetic diversity of gcd. Gcd genes came mainly from the genera of Rhizobium (1.63-77.99%), Ensifer (0.13-56.95%), Shinella (0.32-25.49%), and Sinorhizobium (0.16-11.88%) in the phylum of Proteobacteria (25.10-98.85%). The abundance of these dominant gcd-harboring bacteria was higher in the spring than in autumn, suggesting that they have an important effect on the eutrophication of the Sancha Lake. The alpha and beta diversity of gcd genes presented spatial and temporal differences due to different sampling site types and sampling seasons. Pearson correlation analysis and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) showed that the diversity and abundance of gcd genes were significantly correlated with environmental factors such as dissolved oxygen (DO), phosphorus hydrochloride (HCl-P), and dissolved total phosphorus (DTP). OTU composition was significantly correlated with DO, total organic carbon (TOC), and DTP. GDH encoded by gcd genes transformed insoluble phosphate into dissolved phosphate, resulting in the eutrophication of Sancha Lake. The results suggest that gcd genes encoding GDH may play an important role in lake eutrophication.																			1660-4601					JAN 1	2019	16	1							1	10.3390/ijerph16010001	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16010001								30577417					WOS:000459111400001

There was distinct seasonality with most dependent variables. Feeding rate was highest in summer and varied positively with day length and daily maximum temperature. Number of workers was highest in summer, increased with increasing day length but leveled off at higher values of day length. Mass of individual workers was fairly uniform but tended to be higher in summer; it varied positively with temperature but leveled off at higher temperatures. Percentage of soldiers was highest in early winter and varied inversely with day length and temperature. On average, these colonies ate 7265.2 +/- 1653.3 g (range = 4647.1 g to 9969.9 g) of pine (Pinus sp.) wood in baits over 2 yr.

Early-Holocene warming in Beringia and its mediation by sea-level and vegetation changes	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Arctic land-cover changes induced by recent global climate change (e.g., expansion of woody vegetation into tundra and effects of permafrost degradation) are expected to generate further feedbacks to the climate system. Past changes can be used to assess our understanding of feedback mechanisms through a combination of process modeling and paleo-observations. The subcontinental region of Beringia (northeastern Siberia, Alaska, and northwestern Canada) was largely ice-free at the peak of deglacial warming and experienced both major vegetation change and loss of permafrost when many arctic regions were still ice covered. The evolution of Beringian climate at this time was largely driven by global features, such as the amplified seasonal cycle of Northern Hemisphere insolation and changes in global ice volume and atmospheric composition, but changes in regional land-surface controls, such as the widespread development of thaw lakes, the replacement of tundra by deciduous forest or woodland, and the flooding of the Bering-Chukchi land bridge, were probably also important. We examined the sensitivity of Beringia's early Holocene climate to these regional-scale controls using a regional climate model (RegCM). Lateral and oceanic boundary conditions were provided by global climate simulations conducted using the GENESIS V2.01 atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) with a mixed-layer ocean. We carried out two present-day simulations of regional climate - one with modern and one with 11 ka geography - plus another simulation for 6 ka. In addition, we performed five similar to 11 ka climate simulations, each driven by the same global AGCM boundary conditions: (i) 11 ka Control, which represents conditions just prior to the major transitions (exposed land bridge, no thaw lakes or wetlands, widespread tundra vegetation), (ii) sea-level rise, which employed present-day continental outlines, (iii) vegetation change, with deciduous needleleaf and deciduous broadleaf boreal vegetation types distributed as suggested by the paleoecological record, (iv) thaw lakes, which used the present-day distribution of lakes and wetlands, and (v) post-11 ka All, incorporating all boundary conditions changed in experiments (ii)-(iv). We find that regional-scale controls strongly mediate the climate responses to changes in the large-scale controls, amplifying them in some cases, damping them in others, and, overall, generating considerable spatial heterogeneity in the simulated climate changes. The change from tundra to deciduous woodland produces additional widespread warming in spring and early summer over that induced by the 11 ka insolation regime alone, and lakes and wetlands produce modest and localized cooling in summer and warming in winter. The greatest effect is the flooding of the land bridge and shelves, which produces generally cooler conditions in summer but warmer conditions in winter and is most clearly manifest on the flooded shelves and in eastern Beringia. By 6 ka continued amplification of the seasonal cycle of insolation and loss of the Laurentide ice sheet produce temperatures similar to or higher than those at 11 ka, plus a longer growing season.

THE EFFECTS OF FLOW REGULATION AND CLIMATIC VARIABILITY ON OBSTRUCTED DRAINAGE AND REVERSE FLOW CONTRIBUTION IN A NORTHERN RIVER-LAKE-DELTA COMPLEX, MACKENZIE BASIN HEADWATERS	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												A distinctive hydrological feature of the Lake Athabasca-Peace-Athabasca Delta (LA-PAD) complex is that flow in channels that drain the system reverses direction when stage on the Peace River exceeds that for the central lakes. This river's hydrology has experienced natural and human induced changes since 1968. This study investigates the importance of spring break-up and open-water induced outflow obstruction and reverse flow contributions to annual lake level maxima under natural (1960-1967), regulated (1976-2004) and naturalized (1976-1996) flow regimes. Obstructed and reverse flow events during spring break-up were common prior to and following flow regulation, suggesting that natural climatic variability in source areas below the W. A. C. Bennett Dam exerted a strong influence on their occurrence. Antecedent hydrological conditions, such as fall freeze-up lake level, break-up magnitude, peak spring flow and initial open-water lake level were significantly associated with annual lake level maxima. During the summer period, lake level was linked to sustained high flows on the Peace River. The river obstructed outflow and contributed reverse flow to the LA-PAD in each year prior to 1968. Following regulation, however, more than half the years did not experience any open-water obstruction and/or reversal, and those that did were characterized by smaller events. The average estimated duration of obstruction was more than two weeks shorter and reverse flow volume was reduced by similar to 90% under a regulated regime compared to a simulated naturalized flow regime. This implied a lowered potential for lateral lake expansion into the delta floodplain in some years. The regulated hydrology could produce large stormflow and high lake levels, but only under extreme climatic events in areas below the dam and/or human-induced alterations to normal reservoir operation.

The results of this study revealed considerable seasonal variation in phosphorus cycling. The main sources of phosphorus load in winter were the tributaries, whereas in summer internal loading prevailed. However, the most effective source of SRP (soluble reactive phosphorus) for phytoplankton primary production in summer was its excretion by organisms from the microbial loop. The share of this source in the total phosphorus pool was 38%, whereas internal loading contributed 23.7%, external loading 16.3%, and regeneration by metazooplankton 22%. This exerted a significant influence on the functioning of the whole lake ecosystem. Limiting both external and internal phosphorus loading is recommended to facilitate water quality improvement in the lake.

Wind-driven circulation in Titan's seas	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS												Circulation in Titan's seas forced by wind is simulated by an ocean circulation model using surface wind data predicted by a global circulation model. Wind-driven circulation is insignificant throughout much of the annual cycle but becomes significant from late spring to late summer, when the wind stress becomes strong. The large-scale circulation in summer is predominantly southward near the sea surface and northward near the sea bottom. The sea surface current can get as fast as 5 cms(-1) in some areas. Titan's rotation affects the vertical structure of sea currents in the form of an Ekman spiral if the wind is strong. The maximum wind setup at the shores is of the same order of magnitude as the tidal range. Wind stirring may reduce thermal stratification in summer but may be unable to destroy stratification of methane-rich liquids on top of ethane-rich liquids that can result from imbalances between evaporation and precipitation.

J	Salvarina, I; Gravier, D; Rothhaupt, KO				Salvarina, Ioanna; Gravier, Dorian; Rothhaupt, Karl-Otto			Seasonal insect emergence from three different temperate lakes	LIMNOLOGICA												Knowing the aquatic resources, such as emerging insects, that are entering terrestrial systems is important for food web and conservation studies, especially when water availability or quality is limited. Even though studies concerning benthic macroinvertebrates are numerous, insect emergence from lakes is less studied. To understand if water parameters (e.g., water temperature, oxygen concentration etc) determine insect emergence and the possible seasonal differences, we collected emergent insects from three different lakes in South Germany, during three seasons. We searched for common patterns of insect emergence at the three lakes. Moreover, the relative contribution of insects of aquatic origin to aerial flying arthropods was assessed, with collecting aerial flying arthropods at the shore. Chironomidae constituted the highest number of emerged insects in all lakes, however different patterns of emergence occurred in each lake (unimodal vs. bimodal) with different season-dependent times for the emergence peaks (spring, summer, beginning of autumn). Aquatic insects constituted a considerable proportion (at least 17%) of the aerial flying arthropods at the shore. The variation in insect emergence was explained by water temperature, however not by other water parameters or the nutrient values. Seasonal and spatial differences in insect emergence, should be considered when investigating aquatic-terrestrial interactions and designing conservation plans. A total biomass of up to 1.8 gm(-2) of emerging insects from the littoral zone of Lake Constance can enter the terrestrial system in a year. We also provide length-dry weight relationships for emerged (adult) Chironomidae. These equations are useful to estimate the dry insect biomass from length data and currently such data lack for adult aquatic insects. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Growth characteristics of Zygogonium-dominated filamentous green algae were studied for 4 yr in an experimentally acidified (pH 4.5) lake at the Experimental Lakes Area of northwestern Ontario. They were present in low abundance as periphyton (algal associations attached to surfaces) during spring, and as blooms of metaphyton (benthic algae unconstrained by surfaces) beginning in midsummer and reaching a maximum in early fall. Metaphytic filamentous green algae displayed high photosynthetic capacity in summer despite the oligotrophic nature of the acidified lake. The major factors controlling photosynthetic rates of Zygogonium were similar to those controlling Mougeotia, and included algal crowding, irradiance, dissolved inorganic carbon, and water temperature. Rates of photosynthesis were negatively dependent upon algal crowding, so that highest rates were associated with minimum algal crowding. Light requirements for photosynthesis were higher than those of the epilithon, which were dominant prior to acidification. The dependence of photosynthesis on ambient concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon was partly regulated by water temperature. Anthropogenically caused releases from growth limitations (e.g., increased availability of limiting nutrients, increased water temperature, and extension of the growing season) may cause proliferation of filamentous green algae in the future.																			0706-652X					OCT	1995	52	10					2251	2263		10.1139/f95-816	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f95-816													WOS:A1995TQ59400018
J	Miettinen, IT; Vartiainen, T; Martikainen, PJ				Miettinen, IT; Vartiainen, T; Martikainen, PJ			Bacterial enzyme activities in ground water during bank filtration of lake water	WATER RESEARCH												The interactions between organic matter, bacterial biomass, enzyme activities and environmental factors were studied during bank filtration of humus-rich lake water. The exoenzymatic beta-glucosidase, phosphatase and alanine-aminopeptidase activities in water were measured in vitro as release of fluorescing degradation products from methylumbelliferyl substrates. The total enzymatic decomposition activity was mesured as the hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate (FDA). Bacterial enzymatic activities decreased strongly after infiltration of lake water. The decrease in the enzyme activities correlated with decrease in bacterial counts and biomass production. However, the increase in specific FDA-hydrolysis activity (activity per bacterial cell) indicated that maintenance energy requirements increased during filtration in the ground. There was also an increase in the specific phosphatase activity, which might be associated with the decrease in the concentration of available phosphate. All enzyme activities depended on seasonal temperature changes. The highest FDA-hydrolysis, phosphatase and beta-glucosidase activities occurred during the summer months, when the bacterial production activity and the demand of essential nutrients were highest. On the contrary, the alanine-aminopeptidase activity was highest during autumn and winter, probably as a result of infiltrated nitrogenous material from senescing and dying microbes and algae in lake water. The close correlations between enzymatic activities and other microbial parameters suggest that enzyme activities can be used to monitor the changes in microbiological quality of water during bank filtration of lake water.

Using a 15year stream record combined with winter field measurements and laboratory experiment, we studied the regulation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration in stream water draining boreal mire during snow melt. The most unanticipated finding was that cold soils with deep soil frost resulted in increased snow melt DOC concentrations in the stream runoff. Wintertime field measurements of DOC concentrations below the mire soil frost showed that this phenomenon could be explained by freeze-out of DOC giving higher levels of DOC in the soil water below the ice as the soil frost developed downwards in the mire. Experimental freezing of water with a certain DOC concentration in the laboratory further corroborated the freeze-out of DOC. In this experiment, as much as 96% of the DOC was excluded from the ice, whereas the freeze-out in the mire was less effective (60%). The difference between the proportion of DOC retained in pure water relative to the proportion retained in peat water during freezing is probably due to trapped DOC in the solid peat soil matrix. A simple mass-balance model showed that to explain the higher stream DOC concentrations during a winter with deep soil frost, approximately 0.5% of the mire area needed to be hydrologically connected to the stream discharge. In the stream records, we also found that the DOC concentrations during snow melt episodic runoff were negatively related to increasing intensity of the snow melt episodes (dilution by low DOC snow melt water) and higher previous export of DOC.

The major conservation issue of this critically endangered population is bycatch mortality. We used digestive tract content and stable isotopes (C-13 and N-15) to estimate the diet and seasonal feeding patterns for gaining better understanding of the seals feeding habits and potential conservation implications. The diet was similar across age groups. Altogether 15 fish species were identified and the most important were smelt (Osmerus eperlanus), ruff (Gymnocephalus cernuus), perch (Perca fluviatilis), vendace (Coregonus albula) and cyprinids. The high N-15 values suggested that the seals lose weight during winter and spring. Additionally the drop in N-15 values indicated that pups start to recover from postweaning stress and gain weight around the age of 6 mo. The isotope values differed regionally, which emphasizes that samples from consumers and prey should be collected from the same regions to improve interpretation of the stable isotopic results. Overall, diet composition suggests minimal to nonexistent competition with commercial or recreational fishing. However, observed weight loss of pups during summer may be related to higher risk of bycatch and this should be taken into account when planning temporal fishing closures.																			0824-0469	1748-7692				JAN	2015	31	1					45	65		10.1111/mms.12133	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mms.12133													WOS:000346769200003

The distribution and abundance of chironomids in high-latitude Eurasian lakes with respect to temperature and continentality: development and application of new chironomid-based climate-inference models in northern Russia	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The large landmass of northern Russia has the potential to influence global climate through amplification of climate change. Reconstructing climate in this region over millennial timescales is crucial for understanding the processes that affect the global climate system. Chironomids, preserved in lake sediments, have the potential to produce high resolution, low error, quantitative summer air temperature reconstructions. Canonical correspondence analysis of modern surface sediments from high-latitude lakes, located in northern European Russia and central Siberia, suggests that mean July air temperature is the most significant variable explaining chironomid distribution and abundance. This strong relationship enabled the development of a chironomid-based mean July air temperature-inference model based on 81 lakes and 89 taxa which has a r(jack)(2) = 0.92 and RMSEP = 0.89 degrees C. Comparison of taxon responses to July temperature between this Russian and existing Norwegian data-sets shows that the temperature optima of individual taxa were between 1 and 3 degrees C higher in the Russian data regardless of modelling technique. Reconstructions based on fossil assemblages from a Russian tundra lake core (VORK5) using a Norwegian chironomid-based inference model provide mean July air temperature estimates that are 1.0-2.7 degrees C colder than from the 81-lake Russian model and are also lower than the instrumental record from a nearby meteorological station. The Norwegian model also did not reconstruct decadal-scale fluctuations in temperature seen in the instrumental record. These observations suggest that chironomid-based inference models should only be applied to sediment cores which have similar climate regimes to the geographic area of the training set. In addition a 149 lake, 120 taxa chironomid-based continentality inference model was also developed from the modern Norwegian and Russian training sets. A 2-component WA-PLS model was the minimal adequate model with r(jack)(2) = 0.73 and RMSEP = 9.9 using the Gorczynski continentality index. Comparison of reconstructed continentality indices from the tundra lake, VORK5, show close agreement with local instrumental records over the past 70 years and suggest that the model is reliable. Recent warming in the Arctic has been spatially and seasonally heterogeneous; in many areas warming is more pronounced in the spring and autumn leading to a lengthening of the summer, while summer temperatures have remained relatively stable. A continentality inference model has the potential to detect these seasonal changes in climate. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Now, climate change threatens the regional allocation of water. Tree-ring records indicate that past centuries contained multidecadal "megadroughts" far more severe than those of the historic period. However, the potential for even more persistent droughts, as the result of climate change, is poorly known. We document and evaluate the severity of recent and prehistoric droughts via a combination of data sources: modern temperature, precipitation, and stream gauge data; evidence of low lake-level stands; and related estimates of past hydroclimate change. Modern climate and stream data show an increase in spring temperatures of 2.21 degrees C since 1916, an increase in the frequency of peak spring runoff before 1 May, and a reduction in winter precipitation. Lakes, however, that have only experienced minor hydrologic changes historically were desiccated during prehistoric dry periods during the past 12,000 years. Prehistoric lake shorelines indicate that water supplies were substantially reduced over centuries and millennia, such as from >8,000 to <5,000 years before present. The magnitude of these droughts likely also resulted in ephemeral river flows and thus indicates the potential for persistent shifts in regional hydrology. Such shifts should, therefore, be considered as part of long-term economic and legal planning.

J	Chen, X; Lohrenz, SE; Wiesenburg, DA				Chen, X; Lohrenz, SE; Wiesenburg, DA			Distribution and controlling mechanisms of primary production on the Louisiana-Texas continental shelf	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												The northwest (NW) Gulf of Mexico is marked by strong seasonal patterns in regional and mesoscale circulation and variable effects of riverine/estuarine discharge, which influence distributions of nutrients, phytoplankton biomass and primary production. During a series of five cruises in the NW Gulf of Mexico in 1993 and 1994, an extensive data set was collected including nutrients, phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a), and photosynthesis-irradiance (P-E) parameters. Primary production was estimated using P-E parameters in conjunction with profiles of biomass and irradiance. Relatively high biomass and primary production were observed in inner shelf waters during spring conditions of high river discharge. This was attributed to the retention of biomass and nutrients on the shelf by the combination of high river outflow and a westward flow along the inner shelf with consequent onshore Ekman component. During summer, when surface currents shifted towards the north and east, values of nutrients, biomass and primary production were relatively high east of Galveston Bay and decreased outward from the coast. This pattern was apparently a consequence of nutrient inputs from riverine, upwelling and benthic sources. Nutrients, biomass and productivity in the western portion of the study area in summer were generally lower as a result of the upcoast Row of oligotrophic offshore water. Inter-annual variability was observed between November 1993 and 1994 with higher biomass and productivity occurring in November 1993. This was partially attributed to higher river discharge prior to November 1993, retention of biomass and nutrients by the downcoast flow along the inner shelf, and possibly, injection of nutrients onto the shelf at the shelf break. Our findings demonstrate that the interaction of circulation and availability of Light and nutrients are largely responsible for variations in primary production. Nitrogen appeared to be the primary limiting nutrient, however, a potential for phosphate limitation was also observed particularly during periods of higher river discharge. Light availability was a critical variable during the fall and winter months, when higher primary production was restricted to shallow waters where vertical mixing was constrained by bottom topography. In deep waters, counteractive changes in nutrient and light availability apparently resulted in minor temporal variation between seasons. The annual carbon production in the Louisiana-Texas (LATEX) continental shelf region was estimated to be 159 g C m(-2) year(-1), which is within the range of prior estimates for this region. Given that the area of the study region was approximately 140,000 km(2), this would be equivalent to an areal carbon production of about 22.2 million metric tons. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

During snow-poor winters, such as 1989/90 and 2006/07, several Austrian regions showed noticeable drops in tourism demand-whereas extraordinary sunny, warm and dry summers, like the one in 2003, coincided with above-average tourism demand increases in lake regions. In order to assess the potential impacts of future climate change on tourism demand in Austria, we (1) use dynamic multiple regression models to quantify the sensitivity of overnight stays towards year-to-year weather for each NUTS 3 region and various seasons, (2) apply the resulting sensitivities on climate change scenarios-based on a general tourism development scenario-and (3) transform the resulting impacts on overnight stays into monetary terms using average tourist expenditures. Outcomes suggest predominantly negative impacts on winter tourism and mainly positive impacts on summer tourism, with the net impact being negative. Finally we (4) evaluate the effects of the negative tourism impacts in a macroeconomic CGE model. Resulting spillover effects to other economic sectors as well as changes in GDP and welfare are found to be even higher than the impacts on tourism. There are considerable uncertainties however, not only with respect to climate change scenarios, but also for instance regarding future tourist preferences and weather/climate sensitivities.

The present study employed a rapid method to determine the total and dissolved As and As in SPM at sites covering the entire areas of three large shallow lakes in China, e.g., Taihu, Chaohu, and Dianchi, to obtain a "representative" mean value of the As concentration in various phases. The average concentrations of total and dissolved As were below 6.0 and 3.3 mu g/L, respectively. Arsenic in SPM was much higher than that in waters, as ranging from 24.7 to 516 mu g/g. Lake Taihu exhibited extensive seasonal variation both in total and dissolved As, while little difference was observed in SPM concentration, with an average value of 54.2 and 49.3 mg/L in winter and summer, respectively. Among the algae in the three lakes, Cyanophyta dominated in both cell abundance and biomass. Algae mass occupied significant parts of SPM, especially in Dianchi; the proportions of algae in the SPM fractions were measured as 10.4 and 7.1 % in Taihu in winter and summer, 4.5 % in Chaohu, and 53.3 % in Dianchi, both in summer season. The total As in SPM had a significant positive relationship with total As in water and a high distribution coefficient (Kd) between SPM and dissolved fraction of As at all three lakes. The high proportions of Algae, especially Cyanophyta in the composition of SPM in the three large shallow lakes, might play an important role in affecting the As distribution between the aqueous and particulate phases in aquatic ecosystem.

However, the influence of sediment structure is lacking in environmental predictive models. To this end, the present study links field-based results of sediment aggregate structure to seasonal biological functions in the surface fine-grained laminae (SFGL) of a low-gradient stream. Fluvial sediment collection, microscopy and image analysis are used to show that aggregates collected over a 20 month time period support the concept that aggregate structure can vary seasonally in low-gradient streams where temporarily stored sediment is prominent. Results show that the structure of the transported aggregates is more irregular in the summer with the structure being elongated about the long axes. In the winter, the aggregate structure is compacted and more spherical. Statistical analysis and results suggest that heterotrophic and autotrophic biological activity within the SFGL exhibits seasonal control upon the morphology of transported sediments. Implications of this research are highlighted through calculations of the reactive surface area of the transported suspended sediment load. The surface area of transported sediment is estimated to be 40% greater in the summer as compared to the winter time period, which implies that (i) the affinity of sediments to sorb contaminants is higher in summer months and (ii) the downstream reactivity of FPOM in large rivers, lakes and estuaries is not just a function of microbial drivers but also the seasonally dependent structure of transported FPOM derived from low-order streams.

Variability in fluorescent dissolved organic matter concentrations across diel to seasonal time scales is driven by water temperature and meteorology in a eutrophic reservoir	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Freshwater reservoirs play a significant role in the global carbon cycle by processing and storing large quantities of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Quantifying the magnitude of DOM fluctuations across multiple temporal scales can advance our understanding of how the controls on reservoir carbon cycling may vary. We monitored fluorescent DOM (fDOM) using an in situ epilimnetic sensor at a ten-minute resolution over one year in a eutrophic reservoir in southwestern Virginia, USA with low dissolved organic carbon concentrations (2-6 mg L-1). We determined the dominant time scales of variability and key environmental predictors of fDOM concentrations using continuous wavelet transforms and autoregressive time series modeling. Throughout the year, fDOM concentrations varied considerably, with maximum concentrations in the autumn (30.0 quinine sulfate units) and minimum concentrations in the spring (4.7 quinine sulfate units). The monthly time scale was the dominant time scale of variability, but the daily time scale was significant during the summer. Based on the autoregressive time series analysis, precipitation, water temperature, and shortwave radiation were important environmental predictors of fDOM on daily time scales, while water temperature alone best predicted monthly variability. Our study is one of the first to reveal substantial variability in fDOM concentrations during a full year, emphasizing the need for long-term, high-frequency in situ DOM monitoring to capture changes occurring on multiple time scales. By quantifying the variability and environmental predictors of fDOM on different time scales, we are able to better understand how and why DOM concentrations change throughout the year.					; Paerl, Hans/ABE-7384-2020; Carey, Cayelan/D-4874-2016; Woelmer, Whitney/JVO-2007-2024	Howard, Dexter/0000-0002-6118-2149; Hanson, Paul/0000-0001-8533-6061; 													1015-1621	1420-9055				APR	2021	83	2							30	10.1007/s00027-021-00784-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-021-00784-w													WOS:000620583800001
J	Duman, F; Kar, M				Duman, Fatih; Kar, Musa			Temporal Variation of Metals in Water, Sediment and Tissues of the European Chup (Squalius cephalus L.)	BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												The aim of this study was to analyze seasonal variation of levels of Chromium (Cr), Manganese (Mn), Nickel (Ni), Copper (Cu), Zinc (Zn), Cadmium (Cd) and Lead (Pb) in water, sediment and tissues of Squalius cephalus (L., 1758) taken from five different stations chosen at Yamula Dam Lake (Kayseri, Turkey). Concentrations of metals were generally sorted as water < tissue < sediment. The highest concentration of metals in water was observed in the samples taken in the summer (Mn, 1.04 +/- A 0.15 mg L-1; Ni, 0.42 +/- A 0.12 mg L-1; Cu, 1.25 +/- A 0.88 mg L-1; Zn, 3.61 +/- A 1.53 mg L-1; Pb, 0.58 +/- A 0.09 mg L-1). While the highest Zn (24.85 +/- A 21.82 mu g g(-1)) and Pb (10.89 +/- A 4.2 mu g g(-1)) concentrations in sediment were observed in the winter samples, the highest Mn concentration (167.2 +/- A 99.37 mu g g(-1)) was observed in the summer. Cd pollution was determined in sediment according to international criteria. The highest metal concentration in tissues was generally observed in the liver and the other tissues; following liver were gills and muscles. In liver tissues, while the highest accumulation of Zn (110.34 +/- A 13.1) and Mn (22.5 +/- A 14.85 mu g g(-1)), which are essential for the body, were observed in the winter, Pb (22.58 +/- A 7.83 mu g g(-1)) and Cd (11.77 +/- A 7.83 mu g g(-1)), which are toxic, were found to be higher in the summer. Also, concentrations of Mn, Cd and Pb in muscle tissues were found to be above the limits permitted.

J	Sondergaard, M; Bjerring, R; Jeppesen, E				Sondergaard, Martin; Bjerring, Rikke; Jeppesen, Erik			Persistent internal phosphorus loading during summer in shallow eutrophic lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Nutrient availability, in particular of phosphorus (P), is a key factor for the structure and functioning of shallow lakes, and not least the sediment plays an important role by acting as both a nutrient source and sink. We used 21 years of monthly mass balance and lake water data from six shallow (mean depth = 1.2-2.7 m) and fast flushed (mean hydraulic retention time = 0.6-2.6 months) eutrophic Danish lakes (mean summer P concentrations ranging from 0.09 to 0.61 mg/l) to investigate long-term trends in yearly and seasonal patterns of P retention. To one of the lakes, the external P input was reduced by 70% in the early 1990s, whereas none of the other lakes have experienced major changes in external P loading for more than 20 years. All lakes showed a distinct seasonal pattern with high P concentrations and typically negative P retention during summer (up to -300% of the external loading from May to August). During winter, P retention was overall positive (up to 50% of the external loading from December to April). Internal P loading from the sediment delayed lake recovery by approximately 10 years in the lake with the most recently reduced external loading, but in all the lakes net release of P from the sediment occurred during summer. P release in the six lakes has not abated during the past decade, indicating that the sediment of eutrophic and turbid shallow lakes remains a net source of P during summer. The seasonal variations in P retention became more pronounced with increasing P levels, and retention decreased with increasing temperature, but increased if clear water conditions were established.

J	Wang, MH; Shi, W; Watanabe, S				Wang, Menghua; Shi, Wei; Watanabe, Shohei			Satellite-measured water properties in high altitude Lake Tahoe	WATER RESEARCH												It has been difficult in satellite remote sensing to derive accurate water optical, biological, and biogeochemical products over high-altitude inland waters due to issues in satellite data processing (i.e., atmospheric correction). In this study, we demonstrate that accurate normalized water-leaving radiance spectra nL(w)(lambda) can be derived for a high-altitude lake, Lake Tahoe, using improved Rayleigh radiance computations (Wang, M., Opt. Express, 24, 12414-12429, 2016) which accurately account for water surface altitude effects in the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 (MSL12) ocean color data processing system. Satellite observations from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) between 2012 and 2018 are used to evaluate and validate satellite-derived nL(w)(lambda) spectra, and to quantitatively characterize water properties in the lake. Results show that VIIRS-derived nL(w)(lambda) spectra are quite comparable with those from the in situ measurements. Subsequent retrievals of water biological and biogeochemical products show that chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration and Secchi depth (SD) are reasonably well-estimated, and captured normal seasonal variations in the lake, e.g., the annual highest Chl-a and SD normally occur in the winter while the lowest occur in the summer, which is consistent with in situ measurements. Interannual variability of these water quality parameters is also observed. In particular, Lake Tahoe experienced a significant environmental anomaly associated with an extreme weather condition event in 2017, showing considerably decreased nL(w)(lambda) at the spectral bands of 410, 443, and 486 nm, and significantly reduced SD values in the entire lake. The low SD measurements from VIIRS are consistent with in situ observations. Following the event in the 2017-2018 winter, Lake Tahoe recovered and returned to its typical conditions in spring 2018.

This study focused on the Kolqin Sandy Land Inland Closed Basin. The simulation of energy flux data for the area was conducted by applying Landsat 8 data from 2018 to 2022 during the growing season, the Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB), and the Mapping Evapotranspiration at High Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) models. The validation of both models was performed via eddy covariance systems and large-aperture scintillometers, and the applicability of both models was compared. At the ecosystem scale, the TSEB model exhibited excellent accuracy of latent heat flux simulation in dune and meadow ecosystems (R-2>0.8, RMSE<45.74 W/m(2), and MAPE<26%), while the METRIC model excelled in meadow ecosystems (R-2 = 0.89, RMSE = 27.79 W/m(2), and MAPE = 12%). In contrast, at the regional scale, the TSEB model outperformed METRIC for sensible heat flux simulation (R-2: 0.65-0.68, RMSE: 22.83-43.28 W/m(2), MAPE: 14%-17%). The TSEB model ranked evapotranspiration in the order of lakes>meadow wetlands>farmland>dunes, peaking in August and following a seasonal pattern of summer>spring>autumn. Additionally, evapotranspiration varied with LAI during the pre-middle growth period and responded significantly to triangle T in the late vegetation period.																			1230-1485	2083-5906					2025	34	4					3703	3717		10.15244/pjoes/189361	http://dx.doi.org/10.15244/pjoes/189361													WOS:001462477900016

A new sedimentary record from a coastal lake based on pollen, spores, macrofossils and microscopic charcoal analysis is used to reconstruct the vegetation and fire history in north-eastern Sardinia. During the mid-Holocene (c. 8,100-5,300 cal bp), the vegetation around Stagno di Sa Curcurica was characterised by dense Erica scoparia and E. arborea stands, which were favoured by high fire activity. Fire incidence declined and evergreen broadleaved forests of Quercus ilex expanded at the beginning of the late Holocene. We relate the observed vegetation and fire dynamics to climatic change, specifically moister and cooler summers and drier and milder winters after 5,300 cal bp. Agricultural activities occurred since the Neolithic and intensified after c. 7,000 cal bp. Around 2,750 cal bp, a further decline of fire incidence and Erica communities occurred, while Quercus ilex expanded and open-land communities became more abundant. This vegetation shift coincided with the historically documented beginning of Phoenician period, which was followed by Punic and Roman civilizations in Sardinia. The vegetational change at around 2,750 cal bp was possibly advantaged by a further shift to moister and cooler summers and drier and milder winters. Triggers for climate changes at 5,300 and 2,750 cal bp may have been gradual, orbitally-induced changes in summer and winter insolation, as well as centennial-scale atmospheric reorganizations. Open evergreen broadleaved forests persisted until the twentieth century, when they were partly substituted by widespread artificial pine plantations. Our results imply that highly flammable Erica vegetation, as reconstructed for the mid-Holocene, could re-emerge as a dominant vegetation type due to increasing drought and fire, as anticipated under global change conditions.

J	Crump, BC; Kling, GW; Bahr, M; Hobbie, JE				Crump, BC; Kling, GW; Bahr, M; Hobbie, JE			Bacterioplankton community shifts in an arctic lake correlate with seasonal changes in organic matter source	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Seasonal shifts in bacterioplankton community composition in Toolik Lake, a tundra lake on the North Slope of Alaska, were related to shifts in the source (terrestrial versus phytoplankton) and lability of dissolved organic matter (DOM). A shift in community composition, measured by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA genes, occurred at 4degreesC in near-surface waters beneath seasonal ice and snow cover in spring. This shift was associated with an annual peak in bacterial productivity ([ C-14] leucine incorporation) driven by the large influx of labile terrestrial DOM associated with snow meltwater. A second shift occurred after the flux of terrestrial DOM had ended in early summer as ice left the lake and as the phytoplankton community developed. Bacterioplankton communities were composed of persistent populations present throughout the year and transient populations that appeared and disappeared. Most of the transient populations could be divided into those that were advected into the lake with terrestrial DOM in spring and those that grew up from low concentrations during the development of the phytoplankton community in early summer. Sequencing of DNA in DGGE bands demonstrated that most bands represented single ribotypes and that matching bands from different samples represented identical ribotypes. Bacteria were identified as members of globally distributed freshwater phylogenetic clusters within the alpha- and beta-Proteobacteria, the Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides group, and the Actinobacteria.					; Kling, George/C-7867-2015; Crump, Byron/ABF-3711-2020	Crump, Byron/0000-0001-7062-1273; Kling, George/0000-0002-6349-8227; 													0099-2240					APR	2003	69	4					2253	2268		10.1128/AEM.69.4.2253-2268.2003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.69.4.2253-2268.2003								12676708					WOS:000182151800050

The reservoir is a eutrophic stratified waterbody in central part of Spain, in which the average phytoplankton biomass in summer is higher than 20 mug chlorophyll a 1-1. Maximum phytoplankton biomass in 1999 occurred between the end of summer and the beginning of autumn (September-October). Cyanobacteria, that were generally prevalent in phytoplankton community, clearly dominated during the peak of phytoplankton biomass. Microcystis wesenbergii was dominant amongst the cyanobacteria and represented almost 100 % of the biomass at the time of maximum phytoplankton value. The importance of environmental variables triggering cyanobacterial bloom events is discussed. Our results indicate that neither temperature nor N/P ratio are related to the bloom development. However, high nutrient concentration (ammonium. in particular) and stability of the watercolumn seems to coincide with the maximum abundance of Microcystis wesenbergii.					; Quesada, Antonio/L-2430-2013; PADILLA, CARMENCITA/HPC-8856-2023	Padilla, Carmencita/0000-0002-5812-1871; Quesada, Antonio/0000-0002-8913-5993; Carrasco, David/0000-0002-0551-820X													0003-4088						2002	38	3					173	183		10.1051/limn/2002015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2002015													WOS:000178306500001

A reduced pollen production by thermophilous deciduous tree taxa in the period c. 8250-8000 cal yr BP reveal that the forest ecosystem was affected by low temperatures during the summer and winter/early-spring seasons. This finding is consistent with the timing of the 8.2 ka cold event as registered in the Greenland ice cores. At Hojby So, the climate anomaly appears to have started 200-250 yr earlier than the 8.2 ka cold event as the lake proxy data provide strong evidence for a precipitation-induced distinct increase in catchment soil erosion beginning around 8500 cal yr BP. Alteration of the terrestrial environment then resulted in a major aquatic ecosystem change with nutrient enrichment of the lake and enhanced productivity, which lasted until c. 7900 cal yr BP.

There was a distinct pattern of sediment phosphorus distribution, characterized by (1) higher concentrations in Harvey Estuary than in Peel Met; (2) in Harvey Estuary, the highest concentrations were along the central, 1.5 m depth contour and were higher along the western shore than the eastern shore. Sediment phosphorus and organic matter are enriched in the top few centimetres. In general, sediment total phosphorus and organic matter increased in winter when river flow was high, and in summer-autumn. The within-year distribution of total phosphorus in the surface sediment was related to seasonal changes in macrophyte biomass. Between-year comparisons (1982-1989) suggested unusually high organic-sedimentation and total P in 1983, corresponding to an unusual increase in algal biomass in that year. There were no significant annual variations in sediment P after 1983, suggesting high sediment buffering capacity. Within the sediments, the major components water content, organic content and the forms of phosphorus) were strongly and positively correlated. About 35-52% of the sediment total P was potentially bioavailable, and was sensitive to various environmental conditions (e.g. bottom oxygen depletion, pH and temperature). There is a high potential for sediment to act as a nutrient source, stimulating algal biomass production during low flow periods.

Chemistry and stratification of Antarctic meltwater ponds I: Coastal ponds near Bratina Island, McMurdo Ice Shelf	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												The geochemistry and vertical stratification of shallow meltwater ponds at 78 degrees S near Bratina Island (McMurdo Ice Shelf) have been determined for late winter (October) and summer (January) conditions as part of the Latitudinal Gradient Project. Of the five frozen ponds investigated in October, all were stratified with respect to conductivity, and three had highly saline basal brines beneath the ice at temperatures of -16 to -20 degrees C. In the ice column, inclusions of saline fluid were observed in channels between ice crystals; the abundance increasing with depth and decreasing ice crystal size. In January, seven of the ten ponds investigated (including ponds sampled in October) retained conductivity stratification, whereas significant thermal stratification was observed in only three ponds (maximum Delta T = 5.5 degrees C). Basal brines, ice and meltwaters were Na-Cl or Na-SO4 dominated. FREZCHEM52 modelling, supported by changes in ion ratios, indicated that the precipitation of mirabilite (Na2SO4 center dot 10H(2)O) and gypsum (CaSO4 center dot 2H(2)O) during progressive freezing is an important determinant in chemical evolution of the basal brine. High pH (8.8-11.2) and over-saturation with respect to dissolved oxygen (> 20 mg L-1) in summer, and the presence of sulphide ions in basal brines in winter, occurred in those ponds which experienced high biological productivity during the summer months.

Using host-isolate pairs collected from 1966 to 2004 for 237 IHNV isolates from California and southern Oregon, we examined genetic variation of the mid-G gene of IHNV that could be quantified across times and geographic locations. Information hypothesized to influence genetic variation was environmental and/or fish host demographic factors, viz. location (inland or coastal), year of isolation, habitat (river, lake, or hatchery), the agent factors of subgroup (LI or LII) and serotype (1, 2, or 3), and the host factors of fish age (juvenile or adult), sex (male or female), and season of spawning run (spring, fall, late fall, winter). Inverse distance weighting (IDW) was performed to create isopleth maps of the genetic distances of each subgroup. IDW maps showed that more genetic divergence was predicted for isolates found inland (for both subgroups: LI and LII) than for coastal watershed isolates. A mixed-effect beta regression with a logit link function was used to seek associations between genetic distances and hypothesized explanatory factors. The model that best described genetic distance contained the factors of location, year of isolation, and the interaction between location and year. Our model suggests that genetic distance was greater for isolates collected from 1966 to 2004 at inland locations than for isolates found in coastal watersheds during the same years. The agreement between the IDW and beta regression analyses quantitatively supports our conclusion that, during this time period, more genetic variation existed within subgroup LII in inland watersheds than within coastal LI isolates.

This might be due to a failure to consider interspecific interactions. In this study, the dominant diatom species in a seasonal succession were isolated and verified to adapt to different temperature ranges by constant temperature experiment. Both unialgal and mixed cultures were exposed to two fluctuant temperature treatments that simulated the temperature variations from early spring to summer, with one treatment 4 degrees C higher (warming scenario) than the other. We found that the specific response of diatoms to warming was affected by interspecific interactions. Spring warming had no significant effect on eurythermal species and had a positive effect on the abundance of warm-adapted diatom species, but interspecific interactions reduced this promotional effect. Cold-adapted species had a negative response to spring warming in the presence of other diatom species but had a positive response to early spring warming in the absence of interspecific interactions. In addition, warming resulted in the growth of all diatom species peaking earlier in unialgal cultures, but this effect could be weakened or amplified by interspecies interactions in mixed cultures. Our results suggest that the specific diatom species with different optimal growth temperature ranges responding to warming were expected if there were no interspecific interactions. However, in natural environments, the inevitable and complex interspecific interactions will influence the responses of diatoms to warming. This important factor should not be ignored in the prediction of organism responses to climate warming.

A data-set was presented including two catchments covering the major land use types and different hydrological connection levels to rivers within Eastern China: Middle Yangtze (river-isolated lakes) and Huai River (non-river-connected lakes). Total dissolved nitrogen [TDN, including DON and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN)], total organic carbon (TOC) and physical variables (T, DO, pH, OPR, conductivity) were measured in seventeen lakes over summer and winter. In all study lakes, both DON and NH4 (+)-N were the major fractions of TDN, with much lower proportions of NO3 (-)-N and NO2-N. A variation pattern with higher DON and lower NH4 (+)-N concentrations was observed in non-river-connected lakes, and yet reverse pattern in river-isolated lakes. Higher DON concentrations were recorded with a high extent of farmland in land use, reflecting the influence of human impact on DON loads. These relationships and correlation analysis indicated that DON concentrations were controlled by several factors including temperature, latitude, precipitation, hydrological process and farmland cover in land use. Seasonal variations showed that higher mean surface DON concentration (0.004-0.666 mg/L) was measured in winter, which might be due to resuspension of the organic matter from bottom sediments. The uptake of DON by phytoplankton and bacteria was likely to be the most significant reason for low DON concentrations (0.006-0.335 mg/L) during the summer, supported by increasing DON concentrations accompanied with disappearing Chla after phytoplankton died. Much higher NO3 (-)-N concentrations in summer were attributed to nitrogenous fertilizer, high rainfall, and inorganic nitrogen suspending brought by frequent wind wave.

William			Using multivariate analysis and stable isotopes to assess the effects of substrate type on phytobenthos communities	INLAND WATERS												For more than a century, artificial substrates have been employed in phytobenthos studies. In the present study, we compared the phytobenthos community structure in a field experiment over 3 seasons (summer, autumn, and winter) on 3 types of artificial substrates (brick, brown clay tiles, and grey clay tiles) and 3 natural substrates (macrophytes, rocks, and sediment) in a small, temperate system. A combination of multivariate analyses (cluster, multi-response permutation procedure, indicator species [IndVal], and canonical correspondence analysis [CCA]) and stable isotope analysis was used. We identified 96 total phytobenthos taxa. Artificial substrates resulted in different substrate communities, as shown by stable isotope analysis, cluster analysis, and a multi-response permutation procedure, with only those communities growing on grey tiles being similar to natural substrate communities. Overall, artificial substrates exhibited slightly higher species richness compared to natural substrates over the 3 seasons, although there were no significant differences (p > 0.05). Phytobenthos grown on brown tiles, rocks, and bricks showed seasonal variability of the carbon isotope delta C-13 values using one-way ANOVA (p < 0.05). Phytobenthos community structure did not show great seasonal variation; however, CCA identified water flow, conductivity, ammonium, phosphate, and water depth as important in structuring phytobenthos communities on different substrates. IndVal analysis showed that common phytobenthos taxa were not restricted to a single substrate, but preference was generally high for natural substrate, especially rocks, compared to artificial substrates. Substrate microhabitat type seems to influence the communities within the study areas.

Transient features in a Titan sea	NATURE GEOSCIENCE												Titan's surface-atmosphere system bears remarkable similarities to Earth's, the most striking being an active, global methane cycle akin to Earth's water cycle(1,2). Like the hydrological cycle of Earth, Titan's seasonal methane cycle is driven by changes in the distribution of solar energy(2). The Cassini spacecraft, which arrived at Saturn in 2004 in the midst of northern winter and southern summer, has observed surface changes, including shoreline recession, at Titan's south pole3,4 and equator(5). However, active surface processes have yet to be confirmed in the lakes and seas in Titan's north polar region(6-8). As the 2017 northern summer solstice approaches, the onset of dynamic phenomena in this region is expected(6,7,9-12). Here we present the discovery of bright features in recent Cassini RADAR data that appeared in Titan's northern sea, Ligeia Mare, in July 2013 and disappeared in subsequent observations. We suggest that these bright features are best explained by the occurrence of ephemeral phenomena such as surface waves, rising bubbles, and suspended or floating solids. We suggest that our observations are an initial glimpse of dynamic processes that are commencing in the northern lakes and seas as summer nears in the northern hemisphere.

J	Beyene, MT; Jain, S				Beyene, Mussie T.; Jain, Shaleen			Freezing degree-day thresholds and Lake ice-out dates: Understanding the role of El Nino conditions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												In temperate lakes, the wintertime Accumulated Freezing Degree-Days (AFDD) modulate the thickness and phenology of winter ice-cover, which in turn influence lake ecosystem processes and functions across seasons. Empirical studies show that the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-winter AFDD relationship for North American regions depends on the location and amplitude of the winter ENSO-related sea surface temperature (SST) warming/cooling in the tropical Pacific (TP), and consequently changes in the magnitude and frequency of different ENSO patterns engender shifts and transitions in the North American lake ice regimes. For eight lakes located across North America, we found quasi-linear and non-linear relationships between winter AFDDs and spring lake ice-out dates, and in some cases, existence of thresholds above and below which regression slopes are materially different, thus illuminating differential sensitivities. Conditional quantile functions for winter AFDDs that incorporate ENSO indices as covariates were developed to estimate the relative risk of early/late lake ice-out events for these lakes. For seven of the eight lakes, the canonical Eastern Tropical El Nino pattern increases likelihood of low winter AFDDs (associated with early ice-out dates in these lakes) by 1.5-2.8 times to that of the climatology (1951-2010 average), while the typical Central Pacific El Nino pattern corresponds to a decrease or no significant change in the occurrence probability of early ice-out dates in these Lakes. These results demonstrate that the conditional winter AFDD estimated based on a comprehensive characterization of ENSO allow for delineation of distinct local-to-regional patterns of elevated risk of early ice out and short lake ice-cover season for North American region.					; Jain, Shaleen/B-2923-2011	Jain, Shaleen/0000-0003-1792-4421; 													0899-8418	1097-0088				SEP	2018	38	11					4335	4344		10.1002/joc.5671	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.5671													WOS:000443683600020

Climate models generally predict amplified warming in polar regions(3,4), as observed in Antarctica's peninsula region over the second half of the 20th century(5-9). Although previous reports suggest slight recent continental warming(9,10), our spatial analysis of Antarctic meteorological data demonstrates a net cooling on the Antarctic continent between 1966 and 2000, particularly during summer and autumn. The McMurdo Dry Valleys have cooled by 0.7degreesC per decade between 1986 and 2000, with similar pronounced seasonal trends. Summer cooling is particularly important to Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems that are poised at the interface of ice and water. Here we present data from the dry valleys representing evidence of rapid terrestrial ecosystem response to climate cooling in Antarctica, including decreased primary productivity of lakes (6-9% per year) and declining numbers of soil invertebrates (more than 10% per year). Continental Antarctic cooling, especially the seasonality of cooling, poses challenges to models of climate and ecosystem change.

Projected precipitation changes within the Great Lakes and Western Lake Erie Basin: a multi-model analysis of intensity and seasonality	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												The Great Lakes region encompasses the largest freshwater lake network in the world and supports a diverse network of agriculture, transportation, and tourism. Recently, Lake Erie has experienced increased hypoxia events, which have been attributed to agricultural practices and changes in run-off. Here we examine the projected changes in extreme precipitation events to address concerns regarding regional agriculture, surface run-off, and subsequent water quality. Precipitation projections within the overall Great Lakes Basin and the Western Lake Erie Basin subregion are examined using climate model simulations of varying spatial resolutions to understand historical precipitation and projected future precipitation. We develop three model ensembles for the historical period (1980-1999) and the mid-century (2041-2060) that cover a range of spatial resolutions and future emissions scenarios, including: (1) 12 global model members from the fifth Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) using Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, (2) ten regional climate model (RCM) members from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program driven by CMIP3 global models using the A2 emissions scenario, and (3) two high resolution RCM simulations (RCM4) driven by CMIP5 global models using the RCP 8.5 scenario. For the historical period, all model ensembles overestimate winter and spring precipitation, and many of the models simulate a summer drying that is not observed. At mid-century, most of the models predict a 10-20% increase in precipitation depending on the time of year. Daily probability distribution functions from three model ensembles reveal spring seasonal increases in high precipitation event probabilities when compared to the historical period, suggesting an increase in the frequency of high intensity precipitation at mid-century. Overall, the presence of lakes or higher spatial resolution does not ensure improved representation of historical processes, and more complex interactions between large-scale dynamics, local feedbacks, and physical parameterizations drive the model spread.
