J	Dixon, PG; Kalkstein, AJ				Dixon, P. Grady; Kalkstein, Adam J.			Where are weather-suicide associations valid? An examination of nine US counties with varying seasonality	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY					8th Cuban Congress of Meteorology	NOV 30-DEC 02, 2015	Havana, CUBA	Cuban Meteorol Soc, Int Soc Biometeorol				There has been much research on the associations between weather variables and suicide rates. However, the state of understanding has remained rather stagnant due to many contradictory findings. The purpose of this project is to examine a larger database of suicides that includes a longer and more recent period of record (1975-2010) across numerous locations in the USA. In all, we examine nine total counties (and the primary city associated with them) with a special effort made to compare locations with varying degrees of temperature seasonality: Cook (Chicago), Fulton (Atlanta), King (Seattle), Los Angeles (Los Angeles), Maricopa (Phoenix), Miami-Dade (Miami), Philadelphia (Philadelphia), Salt Lake (Salt Lake City), and St. Louis (St. Louis). We first examine the unique seasonal cycle in suicides evident in each locale and then use distributed lag nonlinear modeling (DLNM) to relate the suicide data to daily surface temperatures. Results suggest that a late spring/summer peak generally exists in suicide rates, and above average temperatures are associated with increased suicide risk in almost all study counties. Further, it appears that these associations can be found in both mid-latitude and sub-tropical climate types.																			0020-7128	1432-1254				MAY	2018	62	5			SI		685	697		10.1007/s00484-016-1265-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-016-1265-1								27822625					WOS:000432607000002

Identification of sources and meteorological influences	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in precipitation samples collected at Mount Taishan were determined by HPLC, to evaluate their concentrations and variations. Individual precipitation events were sampled for 2 years from Sep. 2005 to Aug. 2007. Low concentrations of PAHs were found at the site. Phenanthrene was the most abundant compound with a volume-weighted mean concentration of 33.31 ng/L The next most abundant compound was fluorene, with a concentration of 16.61 ng/L Other individual PAHs occurred at concentrations lower than 10 ng/L The volume-weighted mean concentration of the total PAHs in winter precipitation was much higher than in summer, showing a seasonal variation. Most of the individual PAHs compounds have strong correlations with rainfall amount. Pyrene, benzo(a)anthracene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo (k)fluoranthene and benzo(a)pyrene all had strong correlations with Na+ and Cl-. Diagnostic ratio analysis and factor analysis indicated that the sources of PAHs are mainly from fossil fuel combustion, especially coal. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Temporal changes in nitrogen, carbon, different phosphorus fractions (soluble reactive phosphorus, total soluble phosphorus, particulate phosphorus and total phosphorus) and nutrient ratios (C/N, N/P and C/P), were also investigated in the same population from January 1989 to January 1990. Biomass of above- and belowground structures showed a unimodal seasonal pattern with maxima in summer (180-200 g DW (dry weight)) m-2 and 70-75 g DW m-2 respectively) and minima in winter (30-50 g DW m-2 and 25-30 g DW m-2). Internal concentrations of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus showed seasonal changes, with minima for nitrogen (3.0% for shoots and 1.2% for underground parts) and total phosphorus (0.45% for underground parts) in summer. Shoots and underground parts of Z. noltii contained maximum amounts of nitrogen (5.9 g m-2 and 2.1 g m-2, respectively), phosphorus (1.7 g m-2 and 0.6 g m-2) and carbon (66.9 g m-2 and 27.8 g m-2) in August. The annual flux of nutrients from Z. noltii to the detritus compartment has been estimated to be about 14.6 g N, 4.1 g P and 155.3 g C m-2 of sediment surface.					; Perez-Llorens, Jose/B-9361-2009	Perez-Llorens, Jose Lucas/0000-0003-2813-1443; 													0304-3770					JUL	1993	46	1					49	66		10.1016/0304-3770(93)90064-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(93)90064-4													WOS:A1993LQ76200004

Spatiotemporal variability in energetic condition of alewife and round goby in Lake Michigan	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Pelagic-oriented alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) and benthic-oriented round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) are two important prey fishes in the Laurentian Great Lakes. In 2015, we evaluated their seasonal total energy (TE) across nine Lake Michigan transects. Round goby contained at least 48% more kilojoules of TE than alewife of equal length during spring and summer. TE varied spatially for both species, but only large alewife exhibited a consistent pattern, with higher values along the eastern shoreline. Variation in TE was not explained by site-specific prey densities for either species. Round goby energy density (ED) was higher in Lake Michigan than in central Lake Erie, but comparable to other regions of the Great Lakes. Alewife ED in 2015 was similar to that in 2002-2004 in Lake Michigan, with the exception of November (small alewife ED was 21% higher) and April (large alewife ED was 30% lower). Despite oligotrophication, our study suggests that starvation of juvenile and adults has not been directly contributing to overall declining prey fish abundance, although future research should evaluate the potential for overwinter starvation.					; Warner, David/C-8858-2009	Dieter, Patricia M./0000-0003-1686-2679; Pothoven, Steven/0000-0002-7992-5422; Burlakova, Lyubov/0000-0002-2995-919X; Elgin, Ashley/0000-0001-5728-9843; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				NOV	2019	76	11					1982	1992		10.1139/cjfas-2018-0391	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2018-0391													WOS:000492728400007

Establishing their exact position, according to the regulations of use and protection of waters, as well as their representation and area determination fall under the responsibilities of the general cadastre. Moreover, this also states the topographic number of the river or lake, its correct name and the holder of the right to manage it. The aerial photographic mapping is extremely important in the process of making the water cadastre by photogrammetric methods. The quality and technical parameters of the materials obtained influence the precision and efficiency of water cadastre. For this, the preparation and execution of the photogrammetric flight must be done with great care [1]. Special workings on the rivers are made along the respective topographic element, taking into consideration also the banks of the river. So aerial photographic mapping is done with only one recording strip. Projecting the aerial photographic mapping must refer to the purpose of the photogrammetric elevation. It must also be done according to a series of physical and geographic elements, weather conditions, and economic conditions; the period, the type of film, the photo camera will all have to be decided on according to the above-mentioned elements [2]. The aerial photographic mapping is destined for water cadastre, and the flight must be conducted in autumn-winter or spring, when there is no snow and the trees do not have leaves so they do not cover important elements and planimetric details. Taking into consideration the area weather conditions, we will decide on the best period with sunny days and direction and speed of the wind. It is best to execute aerial photographic mapping at noon, when the shadows of the tall elements are minimal. The project of aerotriangulation represents the optimization of various criteria (the project parameters). Out of these, precision, exactity and economicity are dominant. Understanding the nature of this task, we defined the following project parameters or conditions for the project: the mapping scale and the aero-photogrammetric scale; planimetric position; level position; the maximum allowable variation of coordinates X, Y, Z; using the RC-10 camera; measuring independent models for the triangulation; ensuring the junction points by artificial marking[1]. The basis for position orientation is the existent trigonometric network. The mapping will be done with the help of analogical photogrammetric instruments. The quality of the aerotriangulation model was checked with the help of the already mentioned project parameters [3]. The adapted project represented the basis for continuing the making of the triangulation project necessary for conducting a complex task of restoring the water cadastre on the Timis River for exactly locating the water course.

Infection varied from 26.5 to 39.6% in these lakes and no relationships were found between the pollution level of the lake and the prevalence of infection. H. creplini was the dominant species, representing over 95% of the plasmodia with mature spores. H. psorospermica was encountered very rarely. Histological studies on material collected between October 1989 and September 1990 revealed that the majority of plasmodia were located between secondary lamellae in the gill epithelium. Both the prevalence of infection and development of H. creplini plasmodia displayed a seasonal pattern in all lakes. Plasmodia with mature spores occurred mainly in spring and early summer, whereas early sporogonic stages were found throughout the year. Younger fish were more heavily infected in most cases. The plasmodia of H. creplini were found to be in close contact with the host blood system. We suggest that the location of the parasite in relation to the blood vessel is of major importance in determining the developmental success of a plasmodium. Co-occurrence of plasmodia of different developmental stages could be found, especially in spring. Development of spores in any one cyst, however, was synchronous. Host tissue surrounding plasmodia was always intact but H. creplini did have an obvious deleterious effect on its fish host by decreasing the respiratory surface of the gills. The structure of the H. creplini plasmodium wall is also described using transmission electron microscopy.																			0177-5103	1616-1580				OCT 13	1994	20	1					15	22		10.3354/dao020015	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/dao020015													WOS:A1994PX14900003

In recent years, more than one billion of cubic meters of water from upstream reservoirs and Yellow river have been transported to the lake to rescue the shrinking wetlands. Since the Lake Baiyangdian was actually composed of 143 small lakes and more than 70 villages with large or small area of cropland, dynamic distribution of aquatic plants in wetland such as reed and associated growth condition of these allowed to monitor the changes of wetland landscape and water quality to support the policy applications of water conveyance and wetland environmental treatment and control. Assisted with ground survey analyses and Landsat TM image, the MODIS 250 m time series Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), given its combination of medium spatial and high temporal resolution, were applied to detect the unique rapid growth stage of reed in the spring from adjacent crops such as winter wheat, cotton, and spring maize, of which has a similar phenology in development of leaf area index, and dynamic reed areas were mapped in recent decade. Landscape changes of the wetland were analyzed using maps of reed area and hydrological data.					; A, TEST/S-7244-2019	Zhang, Shengwei/0000-0001-9153-4398; 													0277-786X	1996-756X	978-0-8194-7783-5				2009	7478								74781Y	10.1117/12.831380	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.831380													WOS:000337323200050
J	Brett, MT; Mueller, SE; Arhonditsis, GB				Brett, MT; Mueller, SE; Arhonditsis, GB			A daily time series analysis of stream water phosphorus concentrations along an urban to forest gradient	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												During a 1-year period, we sampled stream water total phosphorus (TP) concentrations daily and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations weekly in four Seattle area streams spanning a gradient of forested to urban-dominated land cover. The objective of this study was to develop time series models describing stream water phosphorus concentration dependence on seasonal variation in stream base flows, short-term flow fluctuations, antecedent flow conditions, and rainfall. Stream water SRP concentrations varied on average by +/-18% or +/-5.7 mu g/L from one week to another, whereas TP varied +/-48% or +/-32.5 mu g/L from one week to another. On average, SRP constituted about 47% of TP. Stream water SRP concentrations followed a simple sine-wave annual cycle with high concentrations during the low-flow summer period and low concentrations during the high-flow winter period in three of the four study sites. These trends are probably due to seasonal variation in the relative contributions of groundwater and subsurface flows to stream flow. In forested Issaquah Creek, SRP concentrations were relatively constant throughout the year except during the fall, when a major salmon spawning run occurred in the stream and SRP concentrations increased markedly. Stream water SRP concentrations were statistically unrelated to short-term flow fluctuations, antecedent flow conditions, or rainfall in each of the study streams. Stream water TP concentrations are highly variable and strongly influenced by short-term flow fluctuations. Each of the processes assessed had statistically significant correlations with TP concentrations, with seasonal base flow being the strongest, followed by antecedent flow conditions, short-term flow fluctuations, and rainfall. Times series models for each individual stream were able to predict similar to 70% of the variability in the SRP annual cycle in three of the four streams (r(2) = 0.57-0.81), whereas individual TP models explained similar to 50% of the annual cycle in all streams (r(2) = 0.39-0.59). Overall, time series models for SRP and TP dynamics explained 82% and 76% of the variability for these variables, respectively. Our results indicate that SRP, the most biologically available and therefore most important phosphorus fraction, has simpler and easier-to-predict seasonal and weekly dynamics.					; Arhonditsis, George/C-6980-2009; Brett, Michael/A-2066-2010	Brett, Michael/0000-0002-8796-9863; Arhonditsis, George/0000-0001-5359-8737; 													0364-152X	1432-1009				JAN	2005	35	1					56	71		10.1007/s00267-003-0310-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-003-0310-0								15984064					WOS:000228298600005
J	Pilkaityte, R; Razinkovas, A				Pilkaityte, Renata; Razinkovas, Arturas			Seasonal changes in phytoplankton composition and nutrient limitation in a shallow Baltic lagoon	BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												In this study we follow seasonal changes in the phytoplankton community composition in a shallow, mostly freshwater lagoon of the Baltic Sea. Nutrient enrichment effects on the quantitative and structural development of phytoplankton communities were also evaluated during short-term experiments in small-size enclosures. Different periods featuring alternate regulatory patterns of phytoplankton seasonal succession in the Curonian lagoon were derived. The spring phase is characterized by silica and phosphorus-limited conditions where nitrogen is a secondary limiting nutrient. Soluble inorganic phosphorus limits green algae, while silica limits diatoms, exclusively pennate species. In the enrichment experiments growth of centric diatom species was favoured by nitrogen addition, while permates reaction was negative. Cyanobacteria dominated summer community is characterized by the nitrogen limitation, while phosphorus occurs as the secondary limiting factor. In general, inorganic nutrient concentrations in the hypereutrophic Curonian lagoon are too high to limit total plankton biomass, which is controlled mostly by the ambient physical factors. However, seasonal variation in nutrient concentrations could shape the phytoplankton community and, in combination with physical factors, force the seasonal succession.

J	OGorman, R; Johannsson, OE; Schneider, CP				OGorman, R; Johannsson, OE; Schneider, CP			Age and growth of alewives in the changing Pelagia of Lake Ontario, 1978-1992	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We documented the age and growth of alewives Alosa pseudoharenqus in Lake Ontario during 1978-1992 and determined if growth was affected by intraspecific competition for epilimnetic zooplankton, lake temperature, or demand of salmonine piscivores for prey. Ages of juvenile alewives were determined from scales during 1978-1983, and ages of juvenile and adult alewives were determined from otoliths during 1984-1992. Indices of abundance for alewives were calculated from spring bottom trawl catches in 1978-1992; zooplankton density and epilimnetic temperature were monitored at two stations during 1981-1991; and salmonine demand each year during 1978-1992 was calculated with a simulation model. Although we encountered 11-year-old alewives, few fish lived longer than 7 years, and most fish in the population were younger than 6 years. Mean sizes at ages 1, 2, and 3 in spring averaged 93 mm (5.1 g), 133 mm (17 g), and 149 mm (22 g), but from age 3 to age 8, mean size increased by only 5-7 mm and 2-3 g per year. Female alewives lived longer than male alewives and were always longer than male alewives at age 4 and older. Epilimnetic temperatures were suitable for rapid growth of juvenile alewives each year. Lake temperature had the potential to affect growth of adults but adult growth was not correlated with temperature suitability indices perhaps because temperature regimes differed among lake regions and alewives were mobile. Growth of alewives was not correlated with salmonine demand for prey. Competition for zooplankton among the two youngest alewife cohorts affected growth of age-1 alewives. Zooplankton density declined sharply in 1986, and should it decline again, growth of age-1 alewives will slow, unless numbers of age-0 alewives fall. Whether growth of age-1 fish declines or numbers of age-0 fish fall, the result of another decline in zooplankton density will be a reduction in the production of alewives needed to support piscivores.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				JAN	1997	126	1					112	126		10.1577/1548-8659(1997)126<0112:AAGOAI>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1997)126<0112:AAGOAI>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1997WK86900009
J	Weiss, M; Simon, M				Weiss, M; Simon, M			Consumption of labile dissolved organic matter by limnetic bacterioplankton: the relative significance of amino acids and carbohydrates	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												We studied the seasonal dynamics and consumption by planktonic bacteria of the labile pools of dissolved organic carbon (DOClab), dissolved amino acids (TDAA(lab)), and dissolved carbohydrates (TDCHOlab) in Lake Constance, Germany, between March and October 1994. The labile pools were defined as those fractions consumed by bacteria in 1 mu m filtered samples over 4 d. DOClab varied from 0.064 to 0.606 mg C l(-1) and constituted 5 to 36 % of bulk DOC, which ranged between 1.45 and 2.3 mg C l(-1). Proportion of DOClab >13 % occurred during the phytoplankton spring bloom, whereas later in the year <13 % of bulk DOC was labile. The bacterial growth efficiency, i.e, the ratio of biomass produced over DOC consumed, ranged from 8 to 57 % with a mean of 23 % and no obvious seasonal trend. TDAA(lab) constituted 10 to 73 % of bulk TDAA and 5 to 95 % of DOClab, respectively, with highest proportions during the spring bloom, the clear-water phase (not of DOClab), and a phytoplankton bloom in July. TDCHOlab constituted 24 to 73 % of bulk TDCHO and 5 to 86 % of DOClab, respectively, with highest proportions during the clear-water phase and in September. TDAA(lab) and TDCHOlab were positively correlated to bulk TDAA and bulk TDCHO, respectively. Even though both substrate classes were the major components of the labile DOC and together constituted 47 to 100 % of DOClab in 75 % of the experiments, they were not utilized to equal amounts but relative proportions varied considerably from May to September. Both substrates often were also utilized differently for biosynthetic and energy requirements as demonstrated by respiration measurements of C-14-amino acids and C-14-glucose. During the spring bloom amino acids were respired preferentially, whereas during the summer bloom glucose was respired preferentially. Turnover times of amino acids and glucose also demonstrated that both substrate classes were utilized differently because turnover times of glucose were consistently longer than those of amino acids except in surface waters from mid-July until September.																			0948-3055	1616-1564				APR 30	1999	17	1					1	12		10.3354/ame017001	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame017001													WOS:000080660500001

Studies of phytoplankton with short generation times and seasonal replacement provide an opportunity for assessing how aquatic organisms respond to changes in environmental conditions. This study explores the potential of chrysophyte cysts as indicators of seasonal and interannual changes in meteorological conditions in Lakes Lazduny and Rzes ' niki, located in northern Poland. Monthly chrysophyte cyst data from sediment traps, biweekly limnological and hydrochemical data, and daily meteorological data were used to find and explain the relationships between chrysophyte cysts and changes in meteorological conditions. We showed that cyst seasonality indirectly corresponds to meteorological conditions acting through changes in the mixing regimes, which in turn influences nutrient and light availability. Statistical analyses revealed that the taxonomic structure and interannual variability of chrysophyte cysts are dependent on multiple variables. Nevertheless, air temperature was the most important meteorological variable influencing cyst assemblages. Cysts were indicative of different periods of lake physical structure, suggesting the potential of chrysophyte cysts in paleoclimatic studies.

Quantifying the components of evapotranspiration is of great significance in revealing the ecohydrological process of alpine inland river basins. In this study, the evapotranspiration fluxes in the Shaliu River basin were classified by hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope technology and remote sensing technology. The results showed the following: (1) The average value of soil fractional evaporation (E-1) in the summer of 2018 and 2019 was 7.59 mm and 2.10 mm, respectively. (2) The average ratio of soil evaporation (E-soil) in the summer of 2018 was 48.82%, 68.11%, 54.99%, respectively. The average ratio of E-soil in the summer of 2019 was 66.86%, 57.50%, 55.53%, respectively. The average value of E-soil in the summer of 2018 and 2019 was 42.84 mm and 35.36 mm, respectively. (3) The average ratio of vegetation transpiration (T) in the summer of 2018 was 51.18%, 31.89%, and 45.01%, respectively. The average ratio of T in the summer of 2019 was 33.14%, 42.50%, and 44.47%, respectively. The average value of T in the summer of 2018 and 2019 was 32.59 mm and 26.23 mm, respectively. Obviously, the soil fractionation was stronger in the summer of 2018 than that in the summer of 2019. At the same time, both soil evaporation and plant transpiration in summer 2018 were higher than those in summer 2019, and soil evaporation in the Shaliu River basin was greater than plant transpiration in summer during the study period. The results of this study can provide data reference for mastering the eco-hydrological process of the Shaliu River basin.					; Cao, Guangchao/AAB-1263-2020; Wang, Zhigang/JTU-3548-2023	Wang, Zhigang/0000-0003-4135-1977; 														2073-4441				MAR	2022	14	5							790	10.3390/w14050790	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14050790													WOS:000768817300001

A Preliminary Analysis of the Impacts of Past and Projected Future Climate on Sour Cherry Production in the Great Lakes Region of the USA	VIII INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MODELLING IN FRUIT RESEARCH AND ORCHARD MANAGEMENT	Acta Horticulturae				8th International Symposium on Modelling in Fruit Research and Orchard Management	NOV 25, 2008	Einsiedeln, SWITZERLAND					Climate-based models simulating the growth, development, and potential productivity of sour cherry have been developed in order to determine the impacts of climate in past and projected future time frames on production areas in the Great Lakes region of the USA. A model of the phenological development of sour cherry flower buds was developed driven by growing degree-day accumulations estimated from maximum and minimum temperature. An empirical yield function was also developed from historical production data available for western Lower Michigan for the period 1982-2001. Following the examination of many potential climate-related influences, three factors were identified as primary determinants of yield: winter/cold injury, number of wet days during pollination, and the amount of precipitation preceding the end of the previous growing season. Time series of growth and yield were simulated at three sites across the region for historical time frames while for projected future time frames only preliminary analysis of growth and development were attempted. The simulations for the historical period suggest that phenological development (i.e., spring development) has occurred earlier in the last decades and that regional yields have been rather stable over time with only a slight increase in the last couple of decades. Projected future temperature scenarios suggest that the percentage of viable flower buds after last spring frost will be comparable to the present. However, the range of possible outcomes from the different scenarios suggests a much larger window of possibilities (i.e., varying from -70% to +30% of viable flowers in the northwest location of Maple City).

In the driest region that we investigated (119 mm annual precipitation), the upper part of two catenas had a larger fraction of microbial biomass in soil organic matter (6-12%) than the four other catenas (<4%) in less dry regions (260 and 442 mm). All six catenas had values <= 4% at the lowest position near the shore of saline lakes. Respiration per unit microbial biomass was similar within and among the catenas, except for the lowest position in three catenas, where enhanced values indicated microbial stress, probably due to high salinity.																			1532-4982	1532-4990				JAN 2	2021	35	1					120	125		10.1080/15324982.2020.1773577	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15324982.2020.1773577		JUN 2020											WOS:000542899000001

Subsequently, anglers caught three round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus) in the St. Clair River near Sarnia, Ontario. Thirty-one tubenose gobies and 11 round gobies were impinged or trawled at or near the Power Plant in the fall and winter of 1990-91. Nine round gobies (29-61 mm total length) are believed to be young-of-the-year. These species were probably transported to the Great Lakes in ballast water, may have successfully colonized the St. Clair River, and will probably spread throughout the Great Lakes. They are expected to impact directly other benthic fishes, such as sculpins (Cottus spp.), darters (Etheostoma spp.), and logperch (Percina caprodes), and in turn act as prey for walleye (Stizostedion vitreum).																			0706-652X					FEB	1992	49	2					416	421		10.1139/f92-047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f92-047													WOS:A1992HE01600024
J	Adamczuk, M				Adamczuk, Malgorzata			The development and reproductive output of three species of Cladocera (Crustacea, Branchiopoda) with different size spectra as the result of vertebrate and invertebrate predation impact	INVERTEBRATE REPRODUCTION & DEVELOPMENT												Seasonal changes in development and reproduction of three species of Cladocera, Bosmina longirostris, Bosmina coregoni and Diaphanosoma brachyurum, were studied in regard to impact of vertebrate (planktivorous fish) and invertebrate (cladoceran Leptodora kindtii and cyclopoid copepods Mesocyclops leuckarti and Thermocyclops oithonoides) predators. Each of the cladocerans represented a different prey type. The population of the largest body-sized D. brachyurum was not affected by predators suggesting unidentified mechanisms of predation-avoidance. Diaphanosoma displayed low reproductive output coinciding with high density. Medium-sized B. coregoni, influenced by planktivorous fish, invested in reproduction and carried large egg-clutches resulting in gradual increase in population density. The population of small body-sized B. longirostris, that was influenced by invertebrate predators, displayed high density and reproductive effort in spring, followed by extreme collapse in abundance and reproduction during summer months. The results suggest that invertebrate predators may suppress populations of some Cladocera more strongly than planktivorous fish.

The Holocene millennial-scale Asian summer monsoon change shows the out-of-phase relationship with the moisture evolution in arid Central Asia. Although much research has been devoted to the long-term climate change, little work has been done on the mechanism. Summer precipitation, in the marginal regions of the Asian monsoon, is strongly affected by the monsoon and the westerly winds. The purpose of this paper is to examine the mechanism of the millennial-scale out-of-phase relationship by modern summer precipitation analysis in the northwest margin of the Asian monsoon (95-110 degrees E, 35-45 degrees N). First, the method of Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis was carried out to the 1960-2008 summer rainfall data from 64 stations in that region; then the water vapor transportation and geopotential height field data were studied, in order to explain and understand the factors that influence the summer precipitation; lastly, the East Asian Summer Monsoon Index (EASMI), South Asian Summer Monsoon Index (SASMI), Summer Westerly Winds Index (SWI) were compared with the EOF time series. The results indicate the complicated interannual-scale interaction between the Asian summer monsoon and the westerly winds, which can result in the modern out-of-phase relationship in the study area. This study demonstrates that the interaction between the two climate systems can be considered as a factor for the millennial-scale out-of-phase relationship. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We choose several cases with different weather characteristics, including winter with/without precipitation and summer with/without precipitation, and conduct a series of experiments (without the lake model, with the default lake model, and with a calibrated lake model that adjusts the water absorption, extinction coefficients, and surface roughness length) for each case. The results show that the performance of the lake model is significantly affected by the weather conditions. For the winter with precipitation cases, the performance of the default lake model is even worse than without the lake model, but the calibrated lake model can obviously reduce the biases of 2-m temperature and dew-point temperature. Although the performance of the default and new calibrated models is intricate for other cases, the new calibrated model has prominent advantages for 2-m dew-point temperature. Moreover, a long-term simulation of five months also shows that the new calibrated coupled lake model performs better than the default one. These imply that the new calibrated coupled lake model is more suitable to be used in studies of the effects of Lake Poyang and Lake Dongting on regional weather and climate.

However, our ability to understand and predict their contribution to both local and global biogeochemical cycles under rapidly occurring environmental change is limited because the spatiotemporal drivers of their biogeochemical patterns and processes are poorly understood. We used (1) pool biogeochemical data from 20 peatlands in eastern Canada, the United Kingdom, and southern Patagonia and (2) multi-year data from an undisturbed peatland of eastern Canada, to determine how climate and terrain features drive the production, delivering and processing of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in peatland pools. Across sites, climate (24%) and terrain (13%) explained distinct portions of the variation in pool biogeochemistry, with climate driving spatial differences in pool dissolved organic C (DOC) concentration and aromaticity. Within the multi-year dataset, DOC, carbon dioxide (CO2), total N concentrations, and DOC aromaticity were highest in the shallowest pools and at the end of the growing seasons, and increased gradually from 2016 to 2021 in relation to a combination of increases in summer precipitation, mean air temperature for the previous fall, and number of extreme summer heat days. Given the contrasting effects of terrain and climate, broad-scale terrain characteristics may offer a baseline for the prediction of small-scale pool biogeochemistry, while broad-scale climate gradients and relatively small year-to-year variations in local climate induce a noticeable response in pool biogeochemistry. These findings emphasize the reactivity of peatland pools to both local and global environmental change and highlight their potential to act as widely distributed climate sentinels within historically relatively stable peatland ecosystems.					; Mackenzie Calderon, Roy/AAU-7621-2020; Martinez-Cruz, Karla/AAC-4902-2021; Talbot, Julie/W-3931-2019; Sepulveda-Jauregui, Armando/J-5049-2019; Helbig, Manuel/H-3690-2019; Hoyos, Jorge/F-3529-2019; Lapierre, Jean-Francois/F-1838-2010	Brown, Lee E./0000-0002-2420-0088; Talbot, Julie/0000-0002-1417-2327; Holden, Joseph/0000-0002-1108-4831; Mackenzie-Calderon, Roy/0000-0001-6620-1532; Sepulveda-Jauregui, Armando/0000-0001-7777-4520; Arsenault, Julien/0000-0002-7840-1838; Hoyos, Jorge/0000-0001-6295-9485; Helbig, Manuel/0000-0003-1996-8639; 													1354-1013	1365-2486				JUL	2023	29	14					4056	4068		10.1111/gcb.16748	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.16748		MAY 2023						37114848					WOS:000981825600001

The final dyke enclosure in April 2006 has transformed the tidal flat into lake and land. The dyke construction has abruptly changed not only the estuarine tidal system inside the dyke, but also the coastal marine environment outside the dyke. In this study, we investigated the spatial change of SST distribution using the Landsat-5/7 and NOAA data before and after the dyke completion in the Saemangeum area. Satellite-induced SST was verified by compared with the various in situ measurements such as tower, buoy, and water sample. The correlation coefficient resulted in above 0.96 and RMSE was about 1(circle)C in all data. 38 Landsat satellite images from 1985 to 2007 were analyzed to estimate the temporal and spatial change of SST distribution from the beginning to the completion of the Samangeum dyke's construction. The seasonal change in detailed spatial distribution of SST was measured, however, the estimation of change during the Saemangeum dyke's construction was hard to figure out owing to the various environmental conditions. Monthly averaged SST induced from NOAA data from 1998 to 2007 has been analyzed for a complement of Landsat's temporal resolution. At the inside of the dyke, the change of SST from summer to winter was large due to the relatively high temperature in summer. In this study, multi sensor thermal remote sensing is an efficient tool for monitoring the temporal and spatial distribution of SST in coastal area.

Todd; Thoma, George			Physical and chemical characteristics of the nearshore zone of Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A long-term, 7-year lake-wide study was paired with a short-term intensive nearshore study to characterize water quality conditions of coastal Lake Ontario in New York. Mean total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in rivers (84.3 +/- 7 mu g P/L), embayments (129.7 +/- 9.6 mu g P/L), and shoreside sites (61.9 +/- 7.4 mu g P/L) exceeded the IJC goal of 10 mu g P/L for Lake Ontario waters and were significantly higher than in offshore waters (L0-100 m, 9.5 +/- 0.7 mu g P/L: LO-30 m, 10.4 +/- 0.08 mu g P/L). In three 5 x 20-km regions of the nearshore located at Oak Orchard, Rochester, and Mexico Bay, TP levels exceeded the 10 mu g P/L goal for Lake Ontario in 48% and 32% of the samples in June and August, respectively. Also, shoreside and embayment chlorophyll a were significantly higher than in offshore waters. Elevated sodium levels observed at shoreside sites of Lake Ontario are likely due to the heavy use of salt during the winter to deice roads. The elevated phosphorus concentrations observed at the shoreside sites extended into Lake Ontario. For example, at the Rochester nearshore sites in June, both TP and turbidity were elevated out to at least 4 km from the shoreline, whereas temperature and specific conductance were elevated out to 3 km from the shoreline. Shoreside sites had some chemical characteristics distinct from both the offshore (LO-30 m and LO-100 m) and river sites within the sampling polygon. A thin band of water with a unique water chemistry compared to both the offshore waters and tributaries extends up to 4 km into the open waters along the southern coast of Lake Ontario during the late spring and summer.

Here we use the body size of Pediastrum, a new and sensitive temperature proxy, from the sediments of Tolbo Lake in the western Mongolian Plateau, to reconstruct changes in winter temperature in the core area of the MSH during the Holocene. A large-scale investigation of modern Pediastrum body size across East Asia indicates that it is an accurate proxy indicator for mean winter temperature. The Holocene winter temperature based on Pediastrum body size from Tolbo Lake shows a general warming trend with the maximum at similar to 2.6 ka. The current warming has attained the magnitude of the previous Holocene maximum, despite the underlying forcing being different. The mid-late Holocene winter warming in inland Eurasia may have weakened the MSH and reduced the intensity of the EAWM.					xiuxiu, ren/JWO-0977-2024; Zhang, Jiawu/C-8633-2011; Zhang, Jun/AAF-6673-2019; Xiang, Lixiong/JWP-9016-2024; Rudaya, Natalia/B-1622-2012; Fahu, Chen/B-2788-2011; LEI, Guoliang/B-3707-2008; Demberel, Otgonbayar/MEK-9203-2025; Liu, Xiaodong/E-9512-2011	/0000-0002-4471-8511; Rudaya, Natalia/0000-0003-1536-6470; Demberel, Otgonbayar/0000-0001-9748-3392; 													0921-8181	1872-6364				NOV	2024	242								104577	10.1016/j.gloplacha.2024.104577	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2024.104577		SEP 2024											WOS:001386713100001

The study of hydroclimatic variability is therefore crucial to understand its manifestation and implications for climate derivatives such as hydrological phenomena and water availability. However, the study of this variability from modern records is limited due to their relatively short span, whereas model simulations relying on modern dynamics could misrepresent some of its aspects. Here we study annual to decadal hydroclimatic variability in the Levant using two sedimentary sections covering similar to 700 years each, from the depocenter of the Dead Sea, which has been continuously recording environmental conditions since the Pleistocene. We focus on two series of annually deposited laminated intervals (i.e., varves) that represent two episodes of opposing mean climates, deposited during MIS2 lake-level rise and fall at similar to 27 and 18 ka, respectively. These two series comprise alternations of authigenic aragonite that precipitated during summer and flood-borne detrital laminae deposited by winter floods. Within this record, aragonite laminae form a proxy of annual inflow and the extent of epilimnion dilution, whereas detrital laminae are comprised of sub-laminae deposited by individual flooding events. The two series depict distinct characteristics with increased mean and variance of annual inflow and flood frequency during "wetter", with respect to the relatively "dryer", conditions, reflected by opposite lake- level changes. In addition, decades of intense flood frequency (clusters) are identified, reflecting the in situ impact of shifting centennial-scale climate regimes, which are particularly pronounced during wetter conditions. The combined application of multiple time series analyses suggests that the studied episodes are characterized by weak and non-significant cyclical components of sub-decadal frequencies. The interpretation of these observations using modern synoptic-scale hydroclimatology suggests that Pleistocene climate changes resulted in shifts in the dominance of the key synoptic systems that govern rainfall, annual inflow and flood frequency in the eastern Mediterranean Sea over centennial timescales.					; Enzel, Yehouda/AAV-5829-2021; ben dor, yoav/LJW-0144-2024; Marra, Francesco/I-3520-2019; Armon, Moshe/GWQ-4177-2022	Enzel, Yehouda/0000-0001-8367-9255; Marra, Francesco/0000-0003-0573-9202; Ben Dor, Yoav/0000-0002-5345-0297													1814-9324	1814-9332				DEC 22	2021	17	6					2653	2677		10.5194/cp-17-2653-2021	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-2653-2021													WOS:000733119500001

The newly built water reservoir is located in Nienawiszcz, RogoZno commune, Poland. The aim of study was to compare experimental sites according to parameters describing water trophy like chlorophyll a, dry mass of seston, total organic carbon, biochemical oxygen demand and according to concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds. Sites were compared using location in reservoir and year season. In the year 2014 (after connection of both parts of lake) part A and B of reservoir had similar trophic conditions, thus confirming stabilisation of the reservoir as an initial freshwater ecosystem. Water table level was also stable, thus low average water depth was not affected water quality Based on canonical variates analysis it was showed, that changes of nitrates and total nitrogen concentrations strongly affected the variability of experimental objects in comparison to concentrations of nitrites and total phosphorus.

Bream is the dominant fish species in this reservoir, making up to 80% of total net catches. During eight years of studies, very regular Chironomus population dynamics were noted in the lotic part of the central, broad basin of the reservoir. There were usually two peaks of the abundance: the higher one in spring, and the much lower one in late summer. Both peaks of Chironomus abundance positively correlated with commercial net catches of bream in the reservoir in particular years. The total bream catch per year in the reservoir studied also correlated positively with the average yearly abundance of Chironomus. The correlation between Chironomus abundance and bream occurrence (measured by commercial net catches) in the reservoir studied suggests that this environment is used by bream mainly as a feeding ground. In the years with a low spring Chironomus peak of abundance, the bream leave the reservoir, searching for food in its inflows - two large, lowland rivers. This corresponds to much lower catches noted in the reservoir in the years of low Chironomus abundance.																			1730-413X	1897-3191				SEP	2009	38	3					15	30		10.2478/v10009-009-0028-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10009-009-0028-2													WOS:000270991300002

Temperature, salt content, and density structure	NORDIC HYDROLOGY												A field study on the temperature, salt content, and density regime in three shallow ice-covered Karelian lakes is presented. The measurements show that the heat content increases during the whole ice-covered period. At ice formation a weak stable stratification existed in the lakes, with average temperatures about 1 degrees C. Thereafter, the stability of the stratification gradually increased, mainly due to pronounced temperature increases in the bottom layers. In mid-winter the bottom layer in the deep parts of the lakes obtained temperatures above 4 degrees C. The density stratification in these layers was stable, however, due to higher salt contents (increasing continuously during the winter) in the vicinity of the bottom. The horizontal variations in temperature and salt content were very small, and both parameters can be considered to be horizontally homogeneous. Under-ice convection was developed in two of the three investigated lakes during the second half of April, when heating due to penetrating solar radiation became apparent. Although no under-ice convection in the conventional sense occurred in the third lake (Uros), interior convection developed when the temperature exceeded 4 degrees C (the temperature of maximum density) there. The absence of under-ice convection in Lake Uros is most likely due to the higher vertical temperature gradient in the lake before spring heating and smaller extinction coefficient than in the other two lakes.

Iestyn; Jennings, Eleanor			Warming winters threaten peripheral Arctic charr populations of Europe	CLIMATIC CHANGE												As the global climate warms, the fate of lacustrine fish is of huge concern, especially given their sensitivity as ectotherms to changes in water temperature. The Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinusL.) is a salmonid with a Holarctic distribution, with peripheral populations persisting at temperate latitudes, where it is found only in sufficiently cold, deep lakes. Thus, warmer temperatures in these habitats particularly during early life stages could have catastrophic consequences on population dynamics. Here, we combined lake temperature observations, a 1-D hydrodynamic model, and a multi-decadal climate reanalysis to show coherence in warming winter water temperatures in four European charr lakes near the southernmost limit of the species' distribution. Current maximum and mean winter temperatures are on average similar to 1 degrees C warmer compared to early the 1980s, and temperatures of 8.5 degrees C, adverse for high charr egg survival, have frequently been exceeded in recent winters. Simulations of winter lake temperatures toward century-end showed that these warming trends will continue, with further increases of 3-4 degrees C projected. An additional 324 total accumulated degree-days during winter is projected on average across lakes, which could impair egg quality and viability. We suggest that the perpetuating winter warming trends shown here will imperil the future status of these lakes as charr refugia and generally do not augur well for the fate of coldwater-adapted lake fish in a warming climate.

AMO warm phases occurred during 1860-1880 and 1940-1960, and cool phases during 1905-1925 and 1970-1990. The signal is global in scope, with a positively correlated co-oscillation in parts of the North Pacific, but it is most intense in the North Atlantic and covers the entire basin there. During AMO warmings most of the United States sees less than normal rainfall, including Midwest droughts in the 1930s and 1950s. Between AMO warm and cool phases, Mississippi River outflow varies by 10% while the inflow to Lake Okeechobee, Florida varies by 40%. The geographical pattern of variability is influenced mainly by changes in summer rainfall. The winter patterns of interannual rainfall variability associated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation are also significantly changed between AMO phases.

The model has been applied to 16 case studies which cover shallow and deep lakes and firths under temperate and tropical climatic conditions. Provided that the basic model is modified in accordance with the characteristic features of the considered ecosystem and account for essential nutrient mass flows, deviations between observations and model output are reasonable, estimated ranges for almost all parameters are in accordance with literature values. In two case studies it was possible to validate a model prediction under radically changed nutrient loadings. In both cases the model responded correctly. However, a model which is able to account for a shift in species composition might be better able to predict the maximum phytoplankton concentration and the date of spring and summer maxima in algae biomass.																			0304-3800	1872-7026				JUL	1986	32	4					251	266		10.1016/0304-3800(86)90090-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3800(86)90090-6													WOS:A1986E038700002

The distribution patterns showed year-to-year variation in the degree of spatial heterogeneity and indicated that both convective mixing and gravity currents contributed to the delivery of oxygen to the profundal zone. We encountered a warm winter in 2007, when deep-water oxygenation was delayed by more than a month relative to normal years. Data obtained during the period of oxygenation in 2007 suggest that the timing of complete oxygenation of the bottom water (or lower layers of the hypolimnion) was controlled by physical processes responsible for destruction of the weak thermal stratification near the bottom. This study revealed that Lake Biwa is sensitive to year-to-year variations in winter meteorological conditions. Specifically, the bottom environments are highly susceptible to a warm winter, especially when it follows a cold winter.					; Tayasu, Ichiro/A-9924-2009	Yoshimizu, Chikage/0000-0002-4535-8976; Tayasu, Ichiro/0000-0002-3006-7973													1439-8621	1439-863X				DEC	2010	11	3					233	239		10.1007/s10201-009-0307-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-009-0307-3													WOS:000278693300004

This study aimed to construct a remote sensing assessment index for urban ecological livability with continuous fine spatiotemporal resolution data from Landsat and MODIS to overcome the dilemma of single image-based, single-factor analysis, due to the limitations of atmospheric conditions or the revisit period of satellite platforms. The proposed Ecological Livability Index (ELI) covers five primary ecological indicators - greenness, temperature, dryness, water-wetness, and atmospheric turbidity - which are geometrically aggregated by non-equal weights based on an entropy method. Considering multisource time-series data of each indicator, the ELI can quickly and comprehensively reflect the characteristics of the Ecological Livability Quality (ELQ) and is also comparable at different time scales. Based on the proposed ELI, the urban ecological livability in the central urban area of Wuhan, China, from 2002 to 2017, in the different seasons was analyzed every 5 years. The ELQ of Wuhan was found to be generally at the medium level (ELI approximate to 0.6) and showed an initial trend of degradation but then improved. Moreover, the ecological livability in spring and autumn and near rivers and lakes was found to be better, whereas urban expansion has led to the outward ecological degradation of Wuhan, but urban afforestation has enhanced the environment. In general, this paper demonstrates that the ELI has an exemplary embodiment in urban ecological research, which will support urban ecological protection planning and construction.					; Li, Xinghua/F-6679-2014; Shen, Huanfeng/HPD-8048-2023	Yu, Junbo/0000-0001-6147-2317; Li, Xinghua/0000-0002-2094-6480; 													1009-5020	1993-5153				MAR 3	2024	27	2					289	310		10.1080/10095020.2022.2072775	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10095020.2022.2072775		JUN 2022											WOS:000811163400001

WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION					5th International Conference on Acidic Deposition - Science and Policy: Acid Reign 95	JUN 26-30, 1995	GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN	Swedish Environm Protect Agcy, Swedish Environm Res Inst, Provincial Govt Goteborg, Provincial Govt Bohus Ian				Studies of benthic animal communities in three limed Norwegian rivers showed differed progress in the recovery response of sensitive animals. In River Vikedal highly sensitive species established populations in the limed part of the river after a few months. The response was slower in River Audna. Longer distances to parental populations was probably the main reason for this. The benthic community of the main River Ogna was unstable, while continuous liming of a highly acidified tributary did not result in improvement of the fauna. In River Vikedal, the bivoltine mayfly Baetis rhodani was more numerous in the autumn samples indicating critical water quality during spring. An adjustment of the pH of the limed water resulted in an increase of this species. The relative abundance of sensitive animals increased downstreams from the point of liming. This may partly be explained by clogging of powdered limestone in the areas closest to the lime doser. A better and more stable water chemistry in the downstream reaches is probably also important. Contrary, the suspended lime did not influence the abundance of filter-feeders.																			0049-6979					DEC	1995	85	2					931	936		10.1007/BF00476949	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00476949													WOS:A1995UB05300107

The development of the lacustrine depression on the piedmont was favoured by the fault network, reinforced by substrate loss by weathering, probably during the late Quaternary. Even during the hot summer season, salinity is low, with concentrations of total dissolved solids (TDS) being around 150 mg L-1. Only when the lagoon is almost dry do TDS concentrations exceed 500 mg L-1, sometimes rising as high as 1700 mg L-1. When the lake level is high, lake chemistry is dominated by Na+, Ca2+, HCO3- and Cl-. During drier stages, there is a relative increase in Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, and SO42-, trending toward a calcium chloride-sulphate brine. Values of pH are above 9 during late spring and summer, resulting primarily from evaporative degassing favoured by the shallow depth of water, and secondarily from photosynthesis by the abundant submerged macrophytes. The infilling deposits, less than 0.5 m thick, are dark brown, massive, sandy muds consisting of quartz and clays (illite, kaolinite, smectite), all of which are allogenic in origin. The main source of dissolved sulphate was the oxidation of sulphides during weathering of lower Palaeozoic rocks in the catchment area. The C-13-depleted nature of dissolved inorganic carbon indicates an origin mostly by respiration and oxidation of organic matter. Geomorphology and hydrogeochemistry indicate a flow-through lake dominated essentially by groundwater flows.					; Jambrina-Enríquez, Margarita/C-8130-2019; Recio, Clemente/I-2637-2015; Armenteros, Ildefonso/K-9983-2014	Jambrina-Enriquez, Margarita/0000-0001-7545-9164; Recio, Clemente/0000-0002-2424-7249; 													1129-5767	1723-8633					2013	72	2					361	375		10.4081/jlimnol.2013.e29	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2013.e29													WOS:000324045100014

The time survey indicated that littoral occupation highly depends on YOY time of appearance. During late spring and summer, the smallest white bream YOY (L-T < 20 mm) were restricted to complex habitats whereas those of pumpkinseed occupied all available habitats. Growing white bream progressively migrated to open water areas. At that time, pumpkinseed was the only species sampled in abundance in the littoral zone and was still collected in all habitats. The success of the introduction of pumpkinseed might be explained by both its late hatching and its opportunistic strategy in habitat selection enabling it to exploit physical spaces left vacant.																			1434-2944	1522-2632					2008	93	2					243	255		10.1002/iroh.200710911	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.200710911													WOS:000256406200010

Winter rape is an important oil crop, which plays an important role in the cooking oil market of China. The Jianghan Plain and Dongting Lake Plain (JPDLP) are major agricultural production areas in China. Essential changes in winter rape distribution have taken place in this area during the 21st century. However, the pattern of these changes remains unknown. In this study, the spatial and temporal dynamics of winter rape from 2000 to 2017 on the JPDLP were analyzed. An artificial neural network (ANN)-based classification method was proposed to map fractional winter rape distribution by fusing moderate resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) data and high-resolution imagery. The results are as follows: (1) The total winter rape acreages on the JPDLP dropped significantly, especially on the Jianghan Plain with a decline of about 45% during 2000 and 2017. (2) The winter rape abundance keeps changing with about 20-30% croplands changing their abundance drastically in every two consecutive observation years. (3) The winter rape has obvious regional differentiation for the trend of its change at the county level, and the decreasing trend was observed more strongly in the traditionally dominant agricultural counties.					; wenxia, tan/GRO-6354-2022	Liu, Wenbin/0000-0003-4547-2506; 													2095-3119					OCT	2019	18	10					2393	2407		10.1016/S2095-3119(19)62577-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-3119(19)62577-3													WOS:000489603700021

Diet of Mysis diluviana reveals seasonal patterns of omnivory and consumption of invasive species in offshore Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Recent changes in Lake Michigan's lower trophic levels were hypothesized to have influenced the diet of omnivorous Mysis diluviana. In this study, the stomach contents of Mysis were examined from juvenile and adults collected monthly (April-October) from a 110-m bottom depth site to describe their seasonal diet in Lake Michigan during 2010. Diatoms were the most common prey item ingested, followed by calanoid copepods, and chrysophytes. Dreissenid veligers were documented in mysid diets for the first time in the Great Lakes, and Cercopagis pengoi were not only consumed but even preferred by adults in summer. Diet proportions by weight were dominated by calanoids, although diets showed a marked shift toward cladocerans in autumn. Juvenile and adult Mysis selected primarily for cladoceran prey but also selected for some calanoid copepod taxa. Comparing available Mysis diet data from 1985 to 2010 indicated generally fewer cladocerans and rotifers per gut and less consistent differences in copepods and Peridinium consumed. The seasonal composition of phyto- and zooplankton prey documented herein should be useful to those seeking to understand the trophic role of Mysis in offshore food webs, but caution should be expressed when generalizing similarities in Mysis diets across other lakes because Lake Michigan's population seems relatively more herbivorous.

Informing Management of Henrys Lake, Idaho, using an Integrated Catch-at-Age Model	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Henrys Lake, Idaho, supports a popular fishery for Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri and Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout x Rainbow Trout O. mykiss hybrids. A majority of the adult population of fish in Henrys Lake are of hatchery origin that were stocked as fingerlings. The fishery is closed to angling during the late winter and spring months, but fisheries managers are considering opening the fishery year-round with catch-and-release-only regulations or with a two-fish bag limit during the extended season. However, there is concern that the proposed management actions may negatively affect the current fishery. Therefore, we developed an integrated catch-at-age model to estimate population parameters for trout in Henrys Lake and used a simulation model to evaluate alternative management actions. Results of this study suggest that catch and release of both Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout and hybrids would increase and that abundance of trout in the spring (i.e., the start of the traditional season) would decrease under both proposed bag limits. Losses in abundance can be mitigated by stocking additional fish as long as no more than approximately 1,520,000 Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout are stocked annually. If catch-and-release-only regulations are implemented during the newly proposed season, total harvest is expected to decrease compared to the current fishery due to additional catch-and-release mortality. Ultimately, managers will need to prioritize harvest or catch-and-release opportunity, both of which provide additional utility to anglers, when choosing how to proceed with bag limit regulations.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG	2022	42	4					857	873		10.1002/nafm.10772	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10772		JUN 2022											WOS:000804542700001

The results obtained from both sites suggest: (1) that phases of higher lake level coincided with a cooling and a shortening of the growing season and an increase in annual precipitation, and (2) that during climatic reversals summer was more affected than winter. They also provide evidence of a sensitive method of reconstruction of climatic variables capable of capturing minor climatic oscillations such as reflected by weakly pronounced lake-level fluctuations. However, comparison of results obtained at Lake Morat and Lake Annecy, with each other and with results from other sites in central Europe, also clearly indicates that either anthropogenic disturbances of the vegetation cover or an overrepresentation of taxa due to particular site exposition can bias the reconstruction of variations in climatic parameters. In addition to pluri-centennial climatic oscillations, both the Lake Morat and Lake Annecy records show a general trend toward temperature cooling over the period considered. This may be related to a reduction in summer insolation induced by orbital factors. Finally, the quantitative estimates of climatic parameters reconstructed at Lake Morat and Lake Annecy help to increase our understanding of the possible impact of climatic oscillations on ancient agricultural communities.

Lithified stromatolites with patches of living coccoid cyanobacterial mat characterize the littoral area, whereas a thick flocculent mat composed of phototrophic prokaryotes (principally purple sulfur bacteria) and diatoms has accumulated in the central lake basin. Lake Thetis is distinguished from other coastal saline lakes by the presence of the unusual flocculent mat and by the juxtaposition of this microbial community to the marginal lithified stromatolites.

Lower delta(13)C values of dissolved inorganic carbon (131,C) in Lake Lugano reflect enhanced OM respiration in the water column. Differences in OM dynamics between both lakes, as well as seasonal variations, are evidenced by TOC-normalised concentration profiles of total fatty acids (FAs) and total neutrals. In Lake Brienz, the results reflect the relative contributions of primary productivity and refractory, allochthonous OM to POM, governed by particle load and interflows due to density stratification. The depth trends at Lake Lugano are a result of high primary productivity, water column stratification and associated particle load in the upper layers, as well as microbially induced degradation close to the chemocline and greater preservation under anoxic conditions. Minor differences exist with regard to the OM composition. In both lakes, FA distributions and the composition of n-alkanols indicate a predominant autochthonous OM source (algae, zooplankton, bacteria). Inputs of OM from diatoms are reflected in highly-branched isoprenoid (HBI) alkenes, 16:1 n-FAs and 24-methylcholesta-5,22-dien-3 beta-ol (either epibrassicasterol or brassicasterol). Differences in relative proportions of n-C(16) vs. n-C(18) FAs and alkanols, respectively, as well as in the percentages of C(27), C(28) and C(29) sterols relative to the sum of sterols are related to differences in the abundances of chrysophytes, diatoms and green algae within the euphotic zone of both lakes as well as in bacterial activity and soil in-wash. High relative proportions of cholesterol in the autumn samples, most pronounced at Lake Lugano, were attributed to an increased input from zooplankton grazing in the water column. Differences in OM degradation processes are reflected in slightly higher chlorin index values and higher relative proportions of saturated vs. unsaturated n-FAs in Lake Lugano. Higher contents of branched chain FAs, 16:1 omega 7 n-FA, and enhanced 18:1 omega 7/18:1 omega 9 n-FA ratios suggest enhanced bacterial biomass in the water column of Lake Lugano close to the chemocline. Increasing proportions of saturated n-FAs and n-alkanols with increasing water depth, most distinct in the autumn for both lakes, argue for intensified bacterial activity and degradation of OM during autumn. High relative contents of sterols and low n-alkanol concentrations in POM close to the chemocline at Lake Lugano during spring are interpreted to reflect higher primary productivity in the photic zone, OM export to the deeper parts and enhanced degradation rates of more labile constituents (i.e. C(13)-C(20) n-alkanols), as compared to Lake Brienz.

J	Kling, HJ; Watson, S				Kling, HJ; Watson, S			A new planktic species of Pseudanabaena (Cyanoprokaryota, Oscillatoriales) from North American large lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												A new species of Pseudanabaena (Cyanoprokaryota, Oscillatoriales) from the plankton of North American large lakes is documented, with ecological and distributional data. This taxon differs from previously described Pseudanabaena species with respect to a characteristic undulating and coiling filament structure. Pseudanabaena contorta spec. nova appears to be specific to large North American Great Lakes with a drainage basin that is not totally Precambrian shield. Recently, it has been found as a consistent but minor component of the planktic cyanoprokaryote populations during the spring and summer months in Lake Superior and Lake Ontario. Comparisons are made with other common species of this genus as well as another undulating morphotype of the genus Glaucospira, that could possibly result in confusion, found in other large Alberta and northern Saskatchewan lakes.																			0018-8158					JUL	2003	502	1-3					383	388		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000004295.11437.df	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000004295.11437.df													WOS:000186636900030
J	Bassett, F; Dietrich, F				Bassett, Fred; Dietrich, Fred			A second decade of overwintering hummingbirds in Florida and Alabama	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												For a second decade, from November 2008 to March 2018, we examined the species diversity, return rate, longevity, and migration routes of hummingbirds overwintering in southern Alabama and the panhandle, northern peninsula, and central peninsula of Florida. We captured and banded 11 species of hummingbirds (n = 1,870 individuals), including 931 Rufous Hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus; 49%), 583 Ruby-throated Hummingbirds (Archilochus colubris; 31%), 219 Blackchinned Hummingbirds (A. alexandri; 12%), 49 Buff-bellied Hummingbirds (Amazilia yucatanensis), 49 Calliope Hummingbirds (S. calliope), 19 Allen's Hummingbirds (S. sasin), 11 Broad-tailed Hummingbirds (S. platycercus), 6 Broad-billed Hummingbirds (Cynanthus latriostris), 1 Anna's Hummingbird (Calypte anna), 1 Costa's Hummingbird (Calypte costae), and 1 White-eared Hummingbird (Hylocharis leucotis). Site fidelity was high, with 299 hummingbirds of 5 species returning at least once. Two Rufous Hummingbirds migrated to our study area in the autumn from the West (Oklahoma and Texas). One Rubythroated Hummingbird handed in Lakeland, Florida, was recovered in Utopia, New Brunswick, Canada, suggesting the overwintering Ruby-throated Hummingbirds in our study area are migratory and not sedentary.																			1559-4491	1938-5447				MAR	2021	133	1					132	+		10.1676/20-00063	http://dx.doi.org/10.1676/20-00063													WOS:000710983000015

Ice velocities and ablation were measured through two summers and one winter. The ice depth was sounded seismically at a transect 8 km above the calving front, showing a maximum depth of 720 m. The velocity field of the terminus was derived from SIR-C/X-SAR data by means of interferometry and amplitude correlation. The average specific annual net accumulation is 5540 +/- 500 mm water equivalent. The bottom topography of the lake and the high ratio of calving flux to net accumulation explain the remarkable stability of Moreno Glacier throughout this century which is in contrast to the retreat of other glaciers in this region.																			0094-8276	1944-8007				MAY 1	1998	25	9					1407	1410		10.1029/98GL00833	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/98GL00833													WOS:000073414900031

Thermal Physiology of Warm-Spring Colonists: Variation among Lake Chub (Cyprinidae: Couesius plumbeus) Populations	PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY												In northern Canada, lake chub (Cyprinidae: Couesius plumbeus) have colonized a variety of thermal springs that differ substantially from the ancestral environment in both mean temperature and thermal variation. To examine whether this environmental change is associated with differences in physiological traits, we compared the thermal breadth, capacity for acclimation of thermal tolerance, and metabolic enzymes in populations of lake chub from three habitats: a warm but variable hot spring, a thermally constant warm spring, and a seasonally variable temperate lake. Thermal breadth was generally lowest in fish from the constant environment, and this difference was statistically significant in fish acclimated at 10 degrees and 25 degrees C. Critical thermal maximum (CTmax) increased with increasing acclimation temperature in all populations. CTmax was similar among populations when acclimated at high temperatures but greater in the variable-spring population acclimated to low temperature (10 degrees C). Critical thermal minimum was also dependent on acclimation temperature in all populations but differed among populations such that fish from the stable-spring habitat were not as tolerant to cold temperature when acclimated to 25 degrees C. Temperate-and variable-spring populations showed an increase in mitochondrial enzyme activities (citrate synthase and cytochrome c oxidase) with decreasing acclimation temperature, but this response was absent in the stable-temperature population. Protein content did not change with acclimation temperature in the stable-temperature population, while it increased with decreasing acclimation temperature in both variable thermal habitat populations. Our study suggests that interpopulation variation in thermal physiology is associated with habitat thermal variability.

Liver total lipid and lipid class composition, as well as plasma concentrations of thyroxine (T4), cortisol, and somatostatin-25 (sSS-25), the predominant form of somatostatin in the pancreas and plasma of salmonids, were measured in age 0+ and 1+ freshwater land-locked fall chinook salmon between March and May 1990. Liver total lipids in age 0+ fish displayed extensive seasonal fluctuation, cycling from high levels to low levels several times over the course of the sampling period. Springtime-associated changes in total lipids were primarily due to diminution of triacylglycerols. Plasma T4 titers in the age 0+ fish also showed substantial seasonal variation with multiple peaks noted over the course of the sampling period. Changes in plasma T4 were highly correlated with liver total lipid; seasonal high plasma T4 levels were observed at the time of maximum lipid depletion. In age 1+ fish, plasma T4 displayed a single peak in coincidence with elevated plasma cortisol levels. Plasma sSS-25 levels in age 1+ fish, measured during smoltification for the first time, also displayed seasonal variation; levels underwent changes generally opposite to those of T4 in early spring. Dramatic increases in plasma T4 were displayed by both age classes of fish when transferred from spring-fed hatchery water to lake water. Our results suggest that land-locked chinook salmon may experience multiple parr-smolt episodes during freshwater development and that springtime-associated and thyroid hormone-correlated lipid depletion occurs in the absence of the fish's exposure to seawater.																			0044-8486					MAR 15	1994	121	1-3					147	155		10.1016/0044-8486(94)90016-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0044-8486(94)90016-7													WOS:A1994NH41100015

A record -breaking heatwave and drought event was reported in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River during the summer of 2022, but only little is known about how cyanobacterial blooms in lakes respond to such climate extremes. Here, we utilized MODIS images to generate the area, occurrence, and initial blooming date (IBD) of cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Chaohu from 2000 to 2022. We found that the area and occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms were largely reduced. At the same time, the IBD was delayed in 2022 compared with the previous 20 years. The annual occurrence and mean area of cyanobacterial blooms in 2022 were 17 % and 23.1 km 2 , respectively, which were the lowest reported levels since the 21st century. The IBD in 2022 was four months late compared with the IBD in 2020. The high wind speed in spring delayed the spring blooms in 2022. The record -breaking heatwaves and drought from June to August reduced the blooms by influencing the growth of cyanobacteria and reducing the flow of nutrients from the watershed into the lake. This study highlights the compound impact of heatwave and drought climate events on reducing cyanobacterial blooms in a long-term period, enhancing additional understanding of the changes in phytoplankton blooms in lakes.

J	MUNAWAR, M; MUNAWAR, IF				MUNAWAR, M; MUNAWAR, IF			THE SEASONALITY OF PHYTOPLANKTON IN THE NORTH-AMERICAN GREAT-LAKES, A COMPARATIVE SYNTHESIS	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The phytoplankton and productivity of the North American Great Lakes has been studied extensively by Fisheries and Oceans Canada during the past 15 years to monitor the impact of nutrient and contaminant loading on the plankton of the ecosystem. Lakewide cruises were conducted at monthly intervals mainly during the spring to fall period. This provided extensive biomass, species, size, productivity and nutrient concentration data for the Great Lakes. These data were collected using the Utermohl inverted microscope technique together with standardized taxonomic, productivity and data-handling procedures. These standardized methodologies were applied to all the Great Lakes which resulted in a comprehensive phycological and ecological data base for the first time. These data form the basis for the evaluation of the complex phenomenon of seasonality. The eutrophic/mesotrophic Lower Great Lakes exhibited well-developed seasonal peaks of high biomass, with inshore-offshore differentiation and spring maxima most pronounced in the inshore region. However, the oligotrophic Upper Great Lakes had low biomass and generally lacked well-developed seasonal patterns. No marked seasonal trends were observed in the ultra-oligotrophic Lake Superior. The seasonality of biomass and various taxonomic groups of phytoplankton showed differentiation between individual lakes and is discussed in detail. The seasonal succession of species provided interesting comparisons between the Lower Great Lakes, which harbor eutrophic and mesotrophic species, and the Upper Great Lakes, which harbor oligotrophic species. Due to the voluminous nature of our data, a general overview has been given for all the Great Lakes with Lake Ontario treated in detail as a case study. The Lake Ontario case study provides the state-of-the-art status ranging from the lakewide surveys of 1970 to the current research with minute organisms such as ultraplankton and picoplankton.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG 5	1986	138						85	115		10.1007/BF00027234	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00027234													WOS:A1986E070900008

The research investigates seasonal variations and interconnections with groundwater, assessing various ecological impacts. The main physico-chemical indicators of water, such as electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), oxygen saturation (OS), temperature, pH, turbidity, ammonium concentration (NH4+), nitrates (NO3-), nitrites (NO2-), orthophosphates (PO43-), water hardness, alkalinity (A), and chlorides (Cl-), were measured over the January-December 2022 period. Metal concentrations for both major metals (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Al) and trace metals (Li, Ga, Fe, Mn, Pb, Cu, Zn, Ni, Ti, Mo, Sr, Ba) were assessed. The evolution of the physico-chemical indicators revealed an increase in nutrient compounds (ammonium and phosphates) during the spring and autumn months. The EC values ranged from 180-444 mu S/cm for the lake and 1575-2480 mu S/cm for groundwater. The pH values (7.12-7.96) indicated a slightly alkaline environment. DO levels (6.79-11.21 mg/L) indicated good water quality. Chlorides exceeded levels in drinking water in some instances. Water hardness varied due to pH, temperature, and atmospheric pressure. Metal composition revealed diverse levels of aluminum, barium, nickel, copper, zinc, and manganese, which carries implications for environmental and human health. The water quality index (WQI) score, which is based on major ions, indicated that 93% of the groundwater samples were classified as excellent and good for drinking. WQI, based on the main physico-chemical indicators, revealed that 79.17% of the Teceu Lake-water samples and 41.66% of the groundwater samples gathered were classified as good quality; the difference indicated poor quality, especially in autumn. Q- and R-mode cluster analyses revealed distinct clusters for seasonal months and sampling points, suggesting shared sources and geological influences. Notable connections between physico-chemical indicators and metal content were identified, emphasizing the need for a tailored conservation strategy. Correlation analyses highlighted both positive and negative relationships between metal pairs. Understanding these parameters is vital for water resource management and preserving biodiversity in the region. The results of this study are important for monitoring pollution in Lake Teceu and might prompt local communities and authorities to take measures to reduce and prevent pollution.

Long-term trends of nutrients and trophic response variables for the Great Lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Based primarily on data collected over the past four decades by Environment Canada, long-term trends of eutrophication-related variables are developed for the offshore waters of the Laurentian Great Lakes. Trends of spring concentration are reported for the major nutrient species: phosphorus [total phosphorus (TP), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP)]; nitrogen [total oxidized nitrogen (NO3 + NO2), and ammonia nitrogen (NH3)]; and silica [soluble reactive silica (SiO2)]. Summer trends of surface chlorophyll a and Secchi depth are developed as indicators of lake trophic response. The results show that phosphorus has declined significantly in all the lakes, whereas nitrogen and silica have both increased. Along with documenting the impacts of the 1978 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement phosphorus controls and the introduction of dreissenids, the results demonstrate conclusively that the offshore waters are now overwhelmingly phosphorus limited, which supports the conclusion that controlling phosphorus remains the only viable option for managing the trophic status of the Great Lakes offshore waters.					; Chapra, Steven/A-5752-2008	Dove, Alice/0000-0003-0152-0844; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2015	60	2					696	721		10.1002/lno.10055	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10055													WOS:000351126500025
J	Sun, JQ; Ming, J				Sun, Jianqi; Ming, Jing			Possible mechanism for the weakening relationship between Indian and central East Asian summer rainfall after the late 1970s: role of the mid-to-high-latitude atmospheric circulation	METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS												The Indian and East Asian summer monsoons are two active components of the global monsoon system and are closely related. However, their relationship is weakened after the late 1970s. This study revisited the possible mechanism for the weakening relationship between Indian and central East Asian summer rainfall, focusing on the influence from the middle-to-high-latitude climate system. The results show that variability in the summer North Atlantic Oscillation since the late 1970s induces a zonal atmospheric teleconnection pattern, resulting in anomalous upper level atmospheric circulation south of the Baikal Lake, which is further closely related to central East Asian summer rainfall over the period after the late 1970s. When the signal of the atmospheric circulation variability south of the Baikal Lake is removed, the relationship between the Indian and central East summer rainfall becomes significant again over the period after the late 1970s. The summer North Atlantic Oscillation thus opposes the influence of the Indian summer rainfall on central East Asian summer rainfall, consequently contributing to the breakdown of the Indian-central East Asian summer rainfall relationship after the late 1970s.

MASS MORTALITY OF THE EASTERN OYSTER CRASSOSTREA VIRGINICA IN THE WESTERN MISSISSIPPI SOUND FOLLOWING UNPRECEDENTED MISSISSIPPI RIVER FLOODING IN 2019	JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH												Globally, precipitation is expected to increase along with the rise of temperatures due to climate change, increasing the likelihood of freshwater intrusion into coastal ecosystems. In the spring and summer of 2019. heavy rainfall and snowmelt in the midwestern United States caused historic flooding of the Mississippi River, warranting two openings of the Bonnet Carre Spillway (BCS) to reduce pressure on levees in New Orleans, LA. These openings released an unprecedented volume of freshwater into Lake Pontchartrain and subsequently into the Mississippi Sound. This study investigated the impacts of these freshwater releases on populations of the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica and water quality in the western Mississippi Sound and the Bay of St. Louis. Platforms housing oysters and water quality sensors that measured dissolved oxygen, salinity, and temperature were deployed at oyster reef sites. At each reef, native oyster populations were assessed via dredge sampling to determine oyster survival. After 13 days, deployed oysters suffered 100% mortality at all sites except the Henderson Point Reef and Kittiwake Reef, the sites farthest east of the BCS. On September 27, 2019, 62 days following the BCS closing, dredge sampling revealed no live native adult oysters or spat, even at sites where living oysters were collected earlier in the summer. If BCS openings increase in frequency or duration because of elevated precipitation, oyster populations in Mississippi could remain unsustainable for harvesting unless future freshwater intrusions are incorporated into management planning.

J	Rettie, WJ; Sheard, JW; Messier, F				Rettie, WJ; Sheard, JW; Messier, F			Identification and description of forested vegetation communities available to woodland caribou: Relating wildlife habitat to forest cover data	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Multivariate analyses were applied to forest canopy and understory data collected in 70 forest stands in the Mid-Boreal Upland Ecoregion in Saskatchewan. Random sampling of various types of forest stands focused on vegetation strata shown elsewhere to be of importance to woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou Gmelin). Cluster analyses revealed seven community types based on summer vegetation, and six community types when considering vegetation present during winter. Ordination by nonmetric multidimensional scaling suggested that two of the seven summer communities be combined, and that six community types be recognized in each season. Stands dominated by Populus tremuloides Michx. were all placed in one community type as were those dominated by Picea glauca (Moench) Voss. Young stands of Pinus banksiana Lamb. were placed in one community type, while the division of older stands was related to degree of canopy closure. The primary division among Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P. dominated stands was also based on the degree of canopy closure. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed strong relationships between the vegetation communities and data on canopy characteristics contained in the provincial forest inventory. In general, the techniques we employ provide a framework for objectively deriving vegetation communities relevant to wildlife species, and measuring their correspondence with readily available forest cover data. Specifically, we describe community types available to woodland caribou in our study area and their relationship to the provincial forest inventory.

Examining the Viability of the World's Busiest Winter Road to Climate Change Using a Process-Based Lake Model	BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												Winter roads play a vital role in linking communities and building economies in the northern high latitudes. With these regions warming 2-3 times faster than the global average, climate change threatens the long-term viability of these important seasonal transport routes. We examine how climate change will impact the world's busiest heavy-haul winter road-the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road (TCWR) in northern Canada. The FLake freshwater lake model is used to project ice thickness for a lake at the start of the TCWR-first using observational climate data, and second using modeled future climate scenarios corresponding to varying rates of warming ranging from 1.5 degrees to 4 degrees C above preindustrial temperatures. Our results suggest that 2 degrees C warming could be a tipping point for the viability of the TCWR, requiring at best costly adaptation and at worst alternative forms of transportation. Containing warming to the more ambitious temperature target of 1.5 degrees C pledged at the 2016 Paris Agreement may be the only way to keep the TCWR viable-albeit with a shortened annual operational season relative to present. More widely, we show that higher regional winter warming across much of the rest of Arctic North America threatens the long-term viability of winter roads at a continental scale. This underlines the importance of continued global efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions to avoid many long-term and irreversible impacts of climate change.

SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL INFLUENCES ON POPULATION DYNAMICS OF A BRANCHIURAN ECTOPARASITE, ARGULUS SP A, IN FRESH WATERS OF TROPICAL NORTHERN QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA	CRUSTACEANA												Spatial and temporal influences on population dynamics of a branchiuran ectoparasite, Argulus sp. A, were investigated. There was a weak, positive correlation between mean Argulus sp. A intensity and size of fish host (Mozambique tilapia). Male hosts had significantly higher Argulus sp. A intensity and prevalence than female hosts. The species was highly aggregated on male and female hosts and its dispersion patterns fitted the negative binomial distribution. There were seasonal changes in prevalence and proportion of immature recruits on male and female tilapia hosts, from a peak during summer to low levels during winter months. Other than host size, differences in Argulus sp. A infection may be related to differences in host behaviour, for example, where segregation of the sexes in host fishes during the spawning season occurs. The species has low host-specificity and was found in fresh water on two other introduced fish species and five native fish species.																			0011-216X	1568-5403				OCT	2008	81	9					1055	1067		10.1163/156854008X360806	http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156854008X360806													WOS:000262726800003

Migration was confined to a period of about two weeks and residence in most creeks was of short duration. Only fish migrating to two small productive lakes remained in the new habitat over the summer. Repeated annual migrations were only recorded in the creek leading to these lakes and no straying was observed among repeat migrants. Water temperatures provided the primary cues for initiation and direction of migration, although an ability to detect productive habitats by odour was indicated. Creek size, feeding opportunities during migration and conspecific odour were subordinate guiding factors.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				MAR	1992	33	3					265	274		10.1007/BF00005870	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00005870													WOS:A1992HM34500005

Lake Hazar is a tectonic Lake in Elazig city. Plajkoy spring is a fault spring that is mainly recharging from the volcanites, dikes and blocky volcanosedimentary units of Middle Eocene Maden Complex. These units have gained secondary permeability and porosity related with the active tectonics that is effective in the studied area. The present catchment system of the spring could not collect the springs and leaks discharging from different points around the system. The discharge of the catchment is measured by specific volume method while the other springs' and leaks' is measured by using triangular weir. Before the discharge measurement of the leaks and the springs, they have been directed to a channel. The discharge of the present catchment system and the leaks have measured twice in a month during one year period beginning from October of 2012 to November of 2013. The discharge coefficient of the spring is calculated 1.33*10(-3) day(-1). Discharge coefficient of the spring depends on the geometry and intensity of the active fracture systems in the region. Calculated discharge coefficient indicates that the spring discharge is related with the narrow fissures, fractures and pores. The total volume of discharged groundwater in the real regime of the Plajkoy spring is calculated as 52* 10(3) m(3) during the period from 31st of March, 2013 to the 13rd of October, 2013 by Maillet formula. The spring water is Ca- Mg- HCO, type water related with the chemical analyses. The chemical and microbiological analyses of the spring water are correlated with the drinking water standarts of Turkey TS 266 (TSE, 2005) and World Health Organization (2004), and it is seen that the spring water is suitable for drinking. The Plajkoy spring will be used more efficiently without exposed to pollution by the new catchment plan and protection zone map that are consequently proposed in the present study.

Effects of resource pulses on nutrient availability, ecosystem productivity, and temporal variability following a stochastic disturbance in eutrophic glacial lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Hypoxia in shallow lakes represents a stochastic disturbance that may elicit a resource pulse through fish decomposition, altering nutrient availability and temporal variability of ecosystem productivity. We measured nutrient availability, primary and secondary production, and temporal variability from April through September in no, moderate, and high carrion lakes following winter 2007-2008 and used a repeated-measures ANOVA and impact trend-by-time analyses to evaluate how increasing levels of fish carrion influence recipient ecosystems. Lakes with carrion had higher nutrient concentrations, pH, turbidity, chlorophyll-a, and zooplankton and benthic invertebrates and less periphyton compared to no carrion lakes. Phytoplankton was positively related to carrion biomass but the association diminished through time suggesting recovery from the initial nutrient pulse. In contrast, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, turbidity, and macroinvertebrates were positively related to carrion biomass and the slope increased throughout the summer suggesting an increasing pulse effect through time. Initially, zooplankton density was negatively related to carrion biomass but then became positively related to carrion biomass. Regression slope between zooplankton and carrion biomass peaked in June before decreasing in late summer, suggesting recovery from the pulse. Combined, our results suggest that nutrients released during fish decomposition following stochastic disturbances represent an important pulse in eutrophic lakes that further enriches																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2016	771	1					165	177		10.1007/s10750-015-2628-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-015-2628-z													WOS:000372798500012
J	Sugiyama, N; Kravtsov, S; Roebber, P				Sugiyama, Noriyuki; Kravtsov, Sergey; Roebber, Paul			Multiple climate regimes in an idealized lake-ice-atmosphere model	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												In recent decades, the Laurentian Great Lakes have undergone rapid surface warming with the summertime trends substantially exceeding the warming rates of surrounding land. Warming of the deepest (Lake Superior) was the strongest, and that of the shallowest (Lake Erie)-the weakest of all lakes. To investigate the dynamics of accelerated lake warming, we considered single-column and multi-column thermodynamic lake-ice models coupled to an idealized two-layer atmosphere. The variable temperature of the upper atmospheric layer-a proxy for the large-scale atmospheric forcing-consisted, in the most general case, of a linear trend mimicking the global warming and atmospheric interannual variability, both on top of the prescribed seasonal cycle of the upper-air temperature. The atmospheric boundary layer of the coupled model exchanged heat with the lake and exhibited lateral diffusive heat transports between the adjacent atmospheric columns. In simpler single-column models, we find that, for a certain range of periodic atmospheric forcing, each lake possesses two stable equilibrium seasonal cycles, which we call "regimes"-with and without lake-ice occurrence in winter and with corresponding cold and warm temperatures in the following summer, respectively, all under an identical seasonally varying external forcing. Deeper lakes exhibit larger differences in their summertime surface water temperature between the warm and cold regimes, due to their larger thermal and dynamical inertia. The regime behavior of multi-column coupled models is similar but more complex, and in some cases, they admit more than two stable equilibrium seasonal cycles, with varying degrees of wintertime ice-cover. The simulated lake response to climate change in the presence of the atmospheric noise rationalizes the observed accelerated warming of the lakes, the correlation between wintertime ice cover and next summer's lake-surface temperature, as well as higher warming trends of the (occasionally wintertime ice-covered) deep-lake vs. shallow-lake regions, in terms of the corresponding characteristics of the forced transitions between colder and warmer lake regimes. Since the regime behavior in our models arises due to nonlinear dynamics rooted in the ice-albedo feedback, this feedback is also the root cause of the accelerated lake warming simulated by these models. In addition, our results imply that if Lake Superior eventually becomes largely ice-free (< 10% maximum ice cover every winter) under continuing global warming, the surface warming trends of the deeper regions of the lake will become modest, similar to those of the shallower regions of the lake.

A total of 191 phytoplankton species was identified, among which Chlorophytes (101) ranked the first, followed by Cyanophytes (46) and Bacillariophytes (28). On average over the entire lake, the maximum total algal biomass appeared in June (19.70 mg/L) with a minimum (5.05 mg/ L) in November. In terms of annual mean biomass, cyanobacteria contributed 45.43% to total algal biomass, followed by Chlorophytes (27.14%), and Bacillariophytes (20.6%). When nitrate (NO3-N) and ammonium (NH4-N) concentrations dropped in spring, fixing-nitrogen cyanobacterium (Anabaena) developed quickly and ranked the first in terms of biomass in summer. It is likely that dominance of zooplanktivorous fish and small crustacean zooplankton favored the development of the inedible filamentous or colony forming cyanobacteria. The persistent dominance of cyanobacteria throughout all seasons may indicate a new tendency of the response of phytoplankton to eutrophication in Lake Chaohu.

Risk from Sirococcus conigenus to understory red pine seedlings in northern Wisconsin	FOREST PATHOLOGY												Interest in development of multicohort stands of red pine (Pinus resinosa) in the Great Lakes region of North America prompted an investigation of the potential impact of the shoot blight pathogen Sirococcus conigenus (syn. S. strobilinus) on understory red pine seedlings. In May 2002 and 2003 healthy, 1-year-old red pine seedlings were planted in the understory of a maturing red pine plantation in northern Wisconsin in an area with a history of presence of this pathogen. Occurrence of shoot blight symptoms was recorded periodically during the summer, and in each year seedlings were harvested in fall and examined for signs of shoot blight pathogens. By fall 2002 and 2003, respectively, shoot blight incidence was 89% and 98% and most seedlings were dying. Pycnidia with conidia of S. conigenus were present on almost all of the symptomatic seedlings. The conifer shoot blight and canker pathogen Diplodia pinea (syn. Sphaeropsis sapinea) was also detected, though less frequently. Pycnidia of S. conigenus tended to be found more frequently on symptomatic current year's shoots than symptomatic previous year's shoots; the opposite was true for pycnidia of D. pinea. Risk from S. conigenus to understory red pine seedlings should be considered in any plans for development of multicohort red pine stands in areas where the pathogen is present.																			1437-4781	1439-0329				AUG	2006	36	4					271	279		10.1111/j.1439-0329.2006.00460.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0329.2006.00460.x													WOS:000239004000005

The effects of organism mass, gender, reproductive cycle, and season on Se accumulation and tissue distribution were investigated. Analyses showed that gender and reproductive cycle had no significant effect on Se accumulation. A. trapezia showed a strong positive correlation between Se burden and tissue mass. Constant Se concentrations were observed within individual populations but varied spatially with sediment Se concentrations. Se concentrations in tissues decreased from gills > gonad/intestine > mantle > muscle > foot, which remained constant over 12 months, however, significantly lower concentrations were observed in the summer compared to winter. A. trapezia is a good biomonitor for Se, as gender and size do not effect concentration, however, season of collection must be reported if changes in Se bioavailability are to be identified in short term studies, or during intersite comparisons.

J	Jiskra, M; Sonke, JE; Agnan, Y; Helmig, D; Obrist, D				Jiskra, Martin; Sonke, Jeroen E.; Agnan, Yannick; Helmig, Detlev; Obrist, Daniel			Insights from mercury stable isotopes on terrestrial-atmosphere exchange of Hg(0) in the Arctic tundra	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The tundra plays a pivotal role in the Arctic mercury (Hg) cycle by storing atmospheric Hg deposition and shuttling it to the Arctic Ocean. A recent study revealed that 70% of the atmospheric Hg deposition to the tundra occurs through gaseous elemental mercury (GEM or Hg(0)) uptake by vegetation and soils. Processes controlling land-atmosphere exchange of Hg(0) in the Arctic tundra are central, but remain understudied. Here, we combine Hg stable isotope analysis of Hg(0) in the atmosphere, interstitial snow air, and soil pore air, with Hg(0) flux measurements in a tundra ecosystem at Toolik Field Station in northern Alaska (USA). In the dark winter months, planetary boundary layer (PBL) conditions and Hg(0) concentrations were generally stable throughout the day and small Hg(0) net deposition occurred. In spring, halogen-induced atmospheric mercury depletion events (AMDEs) occurred, with the fast re-emission of Hg(0) after AMDEs resulting in net emission fluxes of Hg(0). During the short snow-free growing season in summer, vegetation uptake of atmospheric Hg(0) enhanced atmospheric Hg(0) net deposition to the Arctic tundra. At night, when PBL conditions were stable, ecosystem uptake of atmospheric Hg(0) led to a depletion of atmospheric Hg(0). The night-time decline of atmospheric Hg(0) was concomitant with a depletion of lighter Hg(0) isotopes in the atmospheric Hg pool. The enrichment factor, epsilon Hg-202(vegetation) (uptake) = -4.2 parts per thousand (+/- 1.0 parts per thousand) was consistent with the preferential uptake of light Hg(0) isotopes by vegetation. Hg(0) flux measurements indicated a partial re-emission of Hg(0) during daytime, when solar radiation was strongest. Hg(0) concentrations in soil pore air were depleted relative to atmospheric Hg(0) concentrations, concomitant with an enrichment of lighter Hg(0) isotopes in the soil pore air, epsilon Hg-202(soil air-atmosphere) = -1.00 parts per thousand (+/- 0.25 parts per thousand) and (EHgsoil air-atmosphere)-Hg-199 = 0.07 parts per thousand (+/- 0.04 parts per thousand). These first Hg stable isotope measurements of Hg(0) in soil pore air are consistent with the fractionation previously observed during Hg(0) oxidation by natural humic acids, suggesting abiotic oxidation as a cause for observed soil Hg(0) uptake. The combination of Hg stable isotope fingerprints with Hg(0) flux measurements and PBL stability assessment confirmed a dominant role of Hg(0) uptake by vegetation in the terrestrial-atmosphere exchange of Hg(0) in the Arctic tundra.

We divided habitats into five types-deep water, shallow water, mudflat, grassland and farmland. Shallow water and grassland, with rich food and easily accessible water, were preferred by wintering Ruddy Shelducks, Farmland was preferred in mid-winter but avoided in early winter and late winter. Even in mid-winter, the feeding Ruddy Shelduck on farmland were not equally distributed in fields and preferred wet fields (just irrigated) and avoided dry fields. In dry fields, the distances to water sources had great impact on the feeding distribution. Mudflats were only selected in later winter, coinciding with the growth of water-weeds. Deep-water areas were always avoided. Prohibition of human disturbance and retaining shallow water areas and grassland are important measures to mitigate conflict between Ruddy Sheldruck and local people.

J	Tang, YB				Tang, YB			Connections between surface sensible heat net flux and regional summer precipitation over China	ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												Using the observed monthly precipitation and NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction) reanalysis surface flux data from 1951-2000, the connections between the seasonal SSHNF (Surface Sensible Heat Net Flux) over the Asian continent and the regional summer precipitation of China were examined. The patterns of collective and individual correlations were identified. The results indicate that the response of the regional summer precipitation of China to the seasonal SSHNF over the study area varies according to region and season. The interannual variability of summer precipitation anomalies over Xinjiang, the northernmost Northeast China, and the North China Plain are most sensitive to the anomaly of the seasonal SSHNF. There are significant collective correlations between the interannual anomalies of the seasonal SSHNF and summer precipitation over these regions. In contrast, the Southeast Tibetan Plateau, Huaihe River Valley, and surrounding areas exhibit the least significant correlation. Significant individual correlations exist between the summer precipitation over the southernmost Northeast China, East Inner Mongolia, South of the Yangtze River and South China and the seasonal SSHNF in certain seasons over the following areas: near Lake Baikal and Lake Balkhash, near Da Hinggan Mountains and Xiao Hinggan Mountains, as well as the Tibetan Plateau.																			0256-1530	1861-9533				NOV	2004	21	6					897	908																WOS:000225748200007

Rapid accretion of dissolved organic carbon in the springs of Florida: the most organic-poor natural waters	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in groundwater emanating as spring discharge at several locations in Florida, USA and the net increase in DOC in the downstream receiving waters were measured as part of a larger investigation of carbon dynamics in flowing waters. Springs with high discharge (> 2.8 m(3) s(-1)) were found to be the most organic-poor natural waters yet reported (13 +/- 1.6 mu mol C L(-1)), while springs with lesser discharge exhibited somewhat higher DOC concentrations (values ranging from 30 to 77 mu mol C L(-1)). DOC concentrations increased rapidly downstream from the point of spring discharge, with the calculated net areal input rate of DOC ranging from 0.04 to 1.64 mol C m(-2) d(-1) across springs. Rates of DOC increase were generally greater in those springs with high discharge rates. These input rates compare favorably with values reported for gross primary production in these macrophyte-dominated spring systems, assuming that 17% of macrophyte primary production is lost, on average, as DOC. The measures reported here are possible only because of the remarkably low DOC levels in the up-surging groundwaters and the short residency times of the water in the spring-runs themselves.					; Duarte, Carlos M./A-7670-2013; Prairie, Yves/B-9108-2008; Duarte, Carlos/A-7670-2013	Prairie, Yves/0000-0003-1210-992X; Duarte, Carlos M./0000-0002-1213-1361; 													1726-4170						2010	7	12					4051	4057		10.5194/bg-7-4051-2010	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-7-4051-2010													WOS:000285574100010

Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa and Apalachicola-Flint-Chattahoochee River basins' water usage has evolved from power generation to multiple uses. Recreation and housing have become increasingly valuable components. Changing use patterns imply changing resource values. This study focused on six Alabama reservoirs, using contingent valuation questions in on-site, telephone, and mail surveys to estimate impacts on lakefront property values, recreational expenditures, and preservation values for scenarios of permanent changes to reservoir water quantity. As summer full-pool duration decreased, lakefront property value decreased, and as duration increased, property values increased, but at a lesser rate. Similar findings occurred for winter drawdown alternatives. Permanent one-foot reductions in summer full-pool water levels resulted in a 4 to 15 percent decrease in lakefront property values. Recreational expenditures decreased 4 to 30 percent for each one-foot lowering of reservoir water levels. Current nonusers of the six reservoirs showed strong preferences for protecting study reservoirs with willingness to pay values of $47 per household or approximately $29 million for the entire six-reservoir watershed basin area. Resource management based on historic use patterns may be inappropriate and more frequent and comprehensive valuation of reservoir resources is needed.																			1093-474X	1752-1688				AUG	2002	38	4					1007	1018		10.1111/j.1752-1688.2002.tb05541.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2002.tb05541.x													WOS:000178122000011

Relevant hydrogeochemical studies were carried out to achieve this objective. Kocpinar springs emerge on strike-slip Hasandagi fault set (HFS) along the Tuzgold (Salt Lake) fault zone (TFZ) in central Anatolia. The outcrops of volcanic origin exhibit different hydrogeological properties in the study area. The hydrogeochemical evaluations of Kocpinar springs represent good results about the available main groundwater flow systems that exist in this Marbles of Palaeozoic age form the main aquifer that recharges Kocpinar springs. The CO2 gas content of the spring waters is significantly high. Based on the ion concentrations, the water of this spring has mainly two hydrochemical facies: Ca-Mg=HCO3 and Na-HCO3. Although, the hydrochemical analyses showed that waters of these springs meet the drinking and irrigation water standards , the area around the springs is continuously being contaminated by both domestic and agricultural wastes. Therefore, detailed hydrogeological, hydrochemical and isotopic investigations were carried out to accurately estimate the protection zones of Kocpinar springs. These studies showed that three main protection zones could be proposed against external pollution effects around the spring's area.

A thin biofilm developed over 14 weeks during the 'summer' experimental run contained a basal calcite layer overlain by small calcite crystals suspended within the Extracellular Polymeric Substances (EPS). The 'autumn' biofilm, however, showed the development of multi-laminated calcite precipitates within the EPS despite constant environmental conditions throughout the run. The experiments also showed that the largest volume of calcite precipitate developed in the fast-flow flumes regardless of temperature control. Development of an extensive calcite layer at the base of EPS in conditions of complete darkness within the sump was also observed. This study provides increased weight for the concepts: (1) that fresh- and saltwater stromatolites appear to be highly comparable multi-laminated systems with precipitation strongly influenced by both phototrophic and heterotrophic microbes; and (2) that microbial precipitation may be more common within aphotic (including cave, lake bottom and soil) systems than has previously been considered.					; Rogerson, Mike/B-2934-2011	Rogerson, Mike/0000-0001-6016-0549; 													0305-8719		978-1-86239-301-1				2010	336						193	210		10.1144/SP336.9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/SP336.9													WOS:000288434900009

Ten springs were sampled which discharged from limestone or from the contact between limestone and granite. The composition diagrams indicate that there are three individual groups of springs. The reservoir rocks of springs Gol Madar, Gol2, Ezhdeha Madar, Dah, and Gondvila are probably Permian limestone (Ruteh Formation). Spring Ezhdeha1 is recharged from granite. The reservoir rocks of springs Eslam Abad and Narges are Miocene limestone (Qom Formation). Although hydrochemical composition diagrams for separating different springs is an appropriate method, multivariate statistical analysis, such as cluster analysis, can also be used for obtaining detailed hydrochemical differences between springs. 1.																					978-0-415-45136-9				2007							1177	1180																WOS:000252215500247

Raising sublethal exposure to 154 .mu.g/L during the third week resulted in a similar ratio of 1.7 between LC50s of previously exposed and control fish. Thus, prior exposures of 0.5 and 0.9 of the control LC50 resulted in about the same increase in tolerance. The magnitude of the increase was similar to those reported in the literature for other metals. Such acclimation could assist in the survival of fish during spring and autumn surges of aluminum and other metals in surface waters acidified by atmospheric deposition of oxides of sulfur and nitrogen; those environmental changes in aluminum concentration parallel the concentrations used in this research. Experimental water simulated an acid lake with pH of 5.1-5.3 and total hardness of 11 mg/L.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JAN	1986	43	1					243	246		10.1139/f86-030	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f86-030													WOS:A1986AYV4700030

Microbial ecology of Antarctic Lakes	ECOSISTEMAS												Antarctic climate is the hardest in the Earth. Climatic conditions limit biological diversity in Antarctic ecosystems compared to those from lower latitudes. However, Antarctic aquatic ecosystems, and especially those non-marine, which present free liquid water, represent a chance for life, which there can find oases in a frozen desert. Despite Antarctic lakes often present a dense ice cover, abiotic life restrictions are less extreme during Antarctic spring and summer, thus favouring the establishment of planktonic and benthic microbial communities, which include photoautotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria, protists (either photosynthetic, heterotrophic or mixotrophic) and, in those lakes from zones with less restrictive climate, metazooplankton, often copepods, that sometimes can exert an important role in controlling pelagic food webs. Microbial mats, which are mainly formed by cyanobacteria, are, on the other hand, the most characteristic benthic community within Antarctic lakes and wetlands.																			1697-2473					MAY-AUG	2005	14	2					66	78																WOS:000415366100005
J	Salmi, P; Salonen, K				Salmi, Pauliina; Salonen, Kalevi			Regular build-up of the spring phytoplankton maximum before ice-break in a boreal lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The development of phytoplankton biomass and composition in a eutrophic boreal lake was studied during the evolution of under-ice convection in spring. The results from 8 yr showed that, within a few weeks before ice-break, phytoplankton biomass regularly increased by up to two or three orders of magnitude, reaching or exceeding the biomass in summer. Accordingly, this may be the most significant single annual phytoplankton episode in the lake. The development of phytoplankton was closely coupled with that of convection created by solar radiation at water temperatures <4 degrees C. In addition to vertical convection which keeps phytoplankton suspended, there was also horizontal convection which transported water with likely higher abundance of phytoplankton from the shallow lake margins. The effect of mechanical mixing, which was meant to prevent anoxia in the deep water layers of the study basin, was overridden by natural convection. Stochastic variations in weather played a key role controlling light penetration into the lake and hence the abundance and composition of under-ice phytoplankton. After snow melt the proportion of motile algae was at first higher, sometimes with a maximum nearest to the ice, but later diatoms flourished throughout the convection layer. Only in the years of the shortest convection period did the proportion of motile algae remain high until the end of ice cover. More detailed information about the interaction between littoral and pelagial water masses under different mixing regimes is needed for a more profound understanding of the development of phytoplankton under-ice.					; Salmi, Pauliina/AAM-4868-2020	Salmi, Pauliina/0000-0003-3247-2259; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2016	61	1					240	253		10.1002/lno.10214	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10214													WOS:000367983800016

Gyrodactylus salaris (Monogenea, Gyrodactylidae) infections on resident Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) in southern Norway	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES					International Charr Symposium 2006	AUG 01-05, 2006	Reykjavik, ICELAND					This study surveys the distribution of Gyrodactylus salaris on resident Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, in lakes connected to three south-Norwegian watercourses: Numedalsvassdraget, Skiensvassdraget and Hallingdalsvassdraget. Gyrodactylus salaris infected charr was only recorded in Numedalsvassdraget. The parasites had the same mitochondrial haplotype as those previously reported on charr in Lake Palsbufjorden, which is part of Numedalsvassdraget. Since the G. salaris-charr association is persistent in Palsbufjorden and has a wide distribution above the stretches of the watercourse inhabited by anadromous salmonids, this is considered a stable, although perhaps relatively young, host-parasite system. More detailed analyses of these interactions revealed seasonal variations in the parasite population dynamics between late summer and late autumn, with heavier infections occurring in males and older fish in October. This is explained by the combined action of seasonal differences in temperature and physiology and ecology of host cohorts. It is assumed that the occurrence of G. salaris on charr in Palsbufjorden resulted from a host switch to charr from rainbow trout, Onchorynchus mykiss. Host switches may cause significant expansions of the geographical range of pathogenic variants of G. salaris. Therefore, observations of frequently occurring G. salaris on charr have implications for the diagnosis, management and control of salmonid gyrodactylosis.

However, the removal is shown here to occur also during the de-stratification stage in autumn in both the top of the HS-, Fe oxide, and Fe(II) enriched LWM and a thin partially mixed layer above it. This process is shown to be associated with the fast thermocline deepening and induced by enhanced sedimentation of organic matter and Fe-Mn oxides. The primary source of this matter is hypothesized to be the resuspension of sediments deposited at those lake floor areas which become exposed to the intensive water motions in the upper layers due to thermocline deepening. The present chapter describes the effect of physical and biogeochemical regime across the mid-water temperature transition layer on the removal of redox-sensitive elements such as Mo, U, Sb, and Se.

J	Maas, BJ; Wicks, CM				Maas, Benjamin J.; Wicks, Carol M.			CO2 Outgassing from Spring Waters	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												CO2 released from lakes, rivers, and estuaries has been included in estimates of the global CO2 budget; however, CO2 released from carbonate springs has not been routinely included in the estimate of the global CO2 budget. The omission of carbonate spring water as a source of CO2 might result in an underestimation of the overall flux of CO2 from surface waters to the atmosphere. In this study, the flux of CO2 from carbonate springs was calculated and compared to the rate of outgassing of CO2 reported in the literature for other surface water bodies. The calculated fluxes of CO2 from carbonate springs ranged 280-380,000 mmol m(-2) d(-1). A range that is larger than the range of CO2 fluxes reported for estuaries (100-1900 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), headwater streams and rivers (100-1600 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), freshwater lakes (-300 to 3200 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), and saline lakes (-300 to 9900 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). This work demonstrates that the outgassing of CO2 from springs should be included in the global CO2 budget.

J	TANAKA, Y				TANAKA, Y			MICROBIAL DECOMPOSITION OF REED (PHRAGMITES-COMMUNIS) LEAVES IN A SALINE LAKE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Microbial colonization and its relation to the decomposition of reed (Phragmites communis) leaf litter were studied in the littoral area of a saline lake from autumn to summer using litter bag method. There was considerable fungal population on the leaves at the beginning of submergence. These fungi were probably terrestrial in origin. The fungal population rapidly disappeared few days after submergence, when bacteria, including cellulolytic and xylanolytic types, proliferated. Associated with this rapid colonization of bacteria, decomposition rates of cellulose and xylan increased. The rates declined from day 39 to day 100 with decreasing water temperature, though cellulolytic and xylanolytic bacteria maintained a sizeable population until day 150. A community of cellulolytic and xylanolytic fungi increased steeply after day 150. It coincided with a second increase in decomposition rate. These results suggest that the principal decomposers of reed leaf litter were bacteria in the initial phase and fungi in the later phase of the experiment.																			0018-8158					AUG 8	1991	220	2					119	129		10.1007/BF00006544	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006544													WOS:A1991GK30900004

Despite its importance, winter limnology remains relatively understudied. Here, we provide a primer on the predominant drivers of freshwater lake ice cover and the current methodologies used to study lake ice, including in situ and remote sensing observations, physical based models, and experiments. We highlight opportunities for future research by integrating these four disciplines to address key knowledge gaps in our understanding of lake ice dynamics in changing winters. Advances in technology, data integration, and interdisciplinary collaboration will allow the field to move toward developing global forecasts of lake ice cover for small to large lakes across broad spatial and temporal scales, quantifying ice quality and ice thickness, moving from binary to continuous ice records, and determining how winter ice conditions and quality impact ecosystem processes in lakes over winter. Ultimately, integrating disciplines will improve our ability to understand the impacts of changing winters on lake ice. Plain Language Summary Lakes are experiencing accelerated rates of warming, including shorter seasonal duration of ice cover, later ice-on, earlier ice-off, and in some years no ice cover at all. Lake ice has been historically studied independently by four subdisciplines: observations by in situ and remote sensing scientists, controlled mesocosm experiments by limnologists, and process-based models by physical modelers. Here, we highlight opportunities for collaboration between disciplines and provide guidelines to successfully integrate the disciplines to tackle the most urgent questions surrounding lake ice loss in warming climates.

Progress toward the rehabilitation of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in South Bay, Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Our objective was to evaluate the status of lake trout Salvelinus namaycush rehabilitation in South Bay, Lake Huron. Standardized surveys were conducted to quantify natural recruitment, annual mortality, and the contribution of wild- versus hatchery-origin lake trout. Some indicators suggest a high level of natural recruitment. The spawning population was comprised of multiple ages, and the mean age of spawners (8.4 years for females, 7.9 years for males) was at least I year older than the age at 50% maturiry (5.8 years). Estimated annual total mortality rates (0.20-0.25) and sea-lamprey induced mortality rates (0.02) were less than maximum allowable values. The proportion of wild-origin fish captured was high among spawners but varied among sampling programs (42% in fall trap nets, 70% in fall gill nets, and 88% in summer gill nets). A strong year class (1997) could be tracked from 2001 to 2005. Few fish were captured from early (< 1996) or later (1999-2002) year classes. Possible explanations for low natural recruitment during these later years include declining spawning habitat quality caused by low water levels and/or invasion of non-native mussels (Dreissena spp.) and/or direct or indirect effects of alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus).

It was found down to a depth of 5 m in Windermere. Chain copulation seems to be the rule in the English Lake District. A single individual probably lays about 50 eggs in between 10 and 20 capsules. Death follows egg-laying. In sheltered stations in Windermere and the steep part of small streams, specimens grew during the winter and bred early, the new generation appearing in May. Some members of this generation bred again the same summer. In exposed parts of Winder-mere and slower parts of streams, growth was slower in winter, breeding was about 3 months later and there was never a 2d generation. Population density ranged up to 6000 specimens in 10 minutes of collecting, but no explanation of the differing densities is advanced. At any place population density was rather constant throughout the year. Limpets appear to feed by grazing unselectively on the algal felt that covers the substratum.

J	Harris, GP; Baxter, G				Harris, GP; Baxter, G			Interannual variability in phytoplankton biomass and species composition in a subtropical reservoir	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The interannual variability of the dominant phytoplankton populations is described in a subtropical reservoir in Queensland using weekly data for a 16-year period between 1978 and 1994. North Pine Dam, Brisbane, is in an area characterized by strong interannual variability in rainfall. This variability is linked to El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Between 1978 and 1994 periods of drought (during strong ENSO events) were interspersed by periods of flooding rains. Rainfall on the catchment and temperature and oxygen within the dam showed strong 40-day periodicities which also varied in strength interannually in response to ENSO events. Similar patterns of fluctuations in the 40-day periodicity have been found elsewhere in SE Australia. Seasonal cycles of stratification in the dam were a function of both hydrographic and hydrological events. Intermittent rain storms caused partial turnovers and large outflows. As much as 90% of the dam volume was exchanged in a single flood event. 2. The dominant phytoplankton species were similar to those frequently found in tropical and subtropical lakes and reservoirs. The phytoplankton community switched between cyanobacterial blooms (Cylindrospermopsis, Microcystis) during drought and falling water levels and diatom blooms (Aulacoseira) in response to inflows and seasonal turnovers. There appeared to be a subtle interaction between inflows, water column stability, the periodic overturns and the occurrence of the dominant species. All the dominant species showed long periods (2-4 years) of exponential increase or decrease superimposed on top of the seasonal fluctuations in abundance. These patterns of abundance led to marked interannual variability in the phytoplankton biomass. Climate variability had a major impact on the seasonal and interannual changes of the dominant phytoplankton species. 3. Phytoplankton biomass tended to be depressed for about 3 months after individual storm events but the data also displayed long-term lag effects (2-4 years) which destroyed any significant correlation between water residence time and biomass. Summer maxima of biomass dominated by cyanobacteria disappeared between 1985 and 1990 and were replaced by smaller winter peaks. The data presented here are not capable of unequivocally identifying the precise reason for these longer-term effects. Because of the implications for water quality management in subtropical and tropical reservoirs they warrant further study.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				JUN	1996	35	3					545	560																WOS:A1996UY07900006

Structure of Hydrobiocenoses in Mineral and Thermal Springs of the Lake Baikal Region: A Review	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												The available published data and materials from our own research into 14 mineral and 19 thermal springs of the Lake Baikal Region performed in 1997-2017 are summarized. Soil profiles have been laid and samples of water, algae, lichens, mosses, and vascular plants and qualitative and quantitative specimens of zoobenthos have been taken. The profile of soils in the area of springs is short and their chemical composition corresponds to that of water; they are called parasoils. We reveal 257 species of algae in the mineral springs, and most of them (196 species) are assigned to the diatoms. The lichen flora is nonspecific. Seven species are found in the mineral springs, and 100 lower taxa are sampled around the thermal springs. Six types of communities of zoobenthos are specified in the mineral sodium chloride springs according to the group of macroinvertebrates, dominating in biomass: Gastropoda-like, Turbellaria-like, Chironomidae-like, Amphipoda-like, Psychodidae-like, and Ephydridae-like. In the thermal springs, four types of communities of zoobenthos are recognized: Gastropoda-like (with the specification into mono-, two- and three-dominant), Odonata-like, Amphipoda-like, and Chironomidae-like. The thermal springs are mainly characterized by high biomass typical for eutrophic and hypertrophic lakes. The species status of mollusk Lymnaea thermobaicalicaendemic to high-thermal springsis confirmed.

The Biology and Abundance of Sockeye Salmon Spawners in the Nachikinskoye Lake Basin (Southwestern Kamchatka)	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE BIOLOGY												State of the spawning part of the sockeye salmon population in the Nachikinskoye Lake were analyzed. Adults of the early run enter the lake from the sea in spring and early summer, mature in deep areas and spawn from July to the late August in three different types of localities: creeks, springs and lake, respectively forming three ecotypes. Late running fish enter the lake in July-August, mature, and spawn until December in the same localities. Fish from these two runs differ in their age structure, size and fecundity. Males dominate in numbers in both runs, with an increasing proportion of small individuals. Data from aerial surveys suggested that the number of fish on the spawning grounds decreased gradually until 2016. Drone surveys conducted in 2018-2021 provided data on sockeye salmon numbers from the early and late runs on different spawning grounds. The number of spawners from the early run ranged from 100 000-400 000 individuals, and from the late run from 300 000-500 000 individuals. Fluctuations in fish abundance were not synchronous in these two runs. The revealed abundant sockeye spawning stocks require strong protection and detailed annual monitoring to predict further changes in abundance.

Temporal variability in water and nutrient movement through vertisols into agricultural tile drains in the northern Great Plains	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Agricultural tile drainage is expanding in the northern Great Plains of North America. Given ongoing environmental and political concerns related to the eutrophication of Lake Winnipeg in Canada and the potential for tile drains to transport significant quantities of nutrients from agricultural fields, an improved understanding of nutrient dynamics in tile drains in this region is needed. This study characterized seasonal patterns in tile flow and chemistry under variable hydroclimatic conditions and related this variance to temporal variability in soil hydraulic properties in a farm in southern Manitoba, Canada, from 2015 to 2017. Tile flow, soil hydraulic properties, and groundwater table position all varied seasonally, as did the chemistry of tile drain effluent. The majority of annual tile discharge, which occurred in late spring, appears to have been contributed by shallow groundwater, primarily through soil matrix pathways. At these greater tile flow rates, concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and total phosphorus (TP) were low (<0.03 mg L-1 SRP, <0.04 mg L-1 TP), but concentrations of nitrate (NO3-N) were high (20 to 25 mg L-1 NO3-N). In contrast, tile flows outside of this peak period appeared to be primarily attributed to preferential flow pathways through frozen (snowmelt) and dry soil cracks (summer). Phosphorus (P) concentrations were greater during snowmelt and summer (similar to 0.05 mg L-1 SRP, similar to 0.1 mg L-1 TP) but did not produce significant nutrient loads due to the minimal tile discharge rates (<1 mm d(-1)).This work suggests that the expansion of tile drainage may not exacerbate water quality issues involving P in the northern Great Plains but may increase nitrogen (N) loads in local water bodies.

J	Bracht, BB; Stone, JR; Fritz, SC				Bracht, Brandi B.; Stone, Jeffery R.; Fritz, Sherilyn C.			A diatom record of late Holocene climate variation in the northern range of Yellowstone National Park, USA	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					22nd Pacific Climate Workshop	MAR 26-29, 2006	Pacific Grove, CA					The changes in diatom species composition in a sediment core from Crevice Lake, Yellowstone National Park, spanning the past 2550 yr, were used to reconstruct long-term limnological and ecological conditions that may be related to late Holocene climate variability. Planktic forms dominate the fossil diatom assemblages throughout this record, but changes in species dominance indicate varying nutrient levels over time, particularly phosphorus. The changes in the nutrient concentrations in the lake were probably driven by changes in temperature and wind strength that affected the duration of water-column mixing and thus the extent of nutrient recycling from deep waters. Prior to 2100 cal before present (BP), Stephanodiscus minutulus and Synedra tenera dominated, suggesting long cool springs with extensive regeneration of phosphorus from the hypolimnion that resulted from isothermal mixing. From 2100 to 800 cal BP, these species were replaced by Cyclotella michiganiana and Cyclotella bodanica. These species are characteristic of lower nutrient concentrations and are interpreted here to reflect warm summers with long periods of thermal stratification. From 800 to 50 cal BP, S. minutulus dominated the diatom assemblage, suggesting a return to lengthy mixing during spring. The most dramatic late Holocene changes in the fossil diatom assemblages occurred during the transition from the Medieval Period to the Little Ice Age, approximately 800 cal BP.

The East Asian subtropical westerly jet (EASWJ), an important component of the summer monsoon circulations, was investigated to elucidate the dynamical linkages between its intraseasonal variations and local weather extremes. Based on EOF analysis, the dominant mode of the EASWJ in early summer is char-acterized by anomalous westerlies centered over North China and anomalous easterlies centered over the south of Japan. This mode is conducive to the occurrence of precipitation extremes over Central and North China and humid heat extremes over most areas of China except Northwest and Northeast China. The centers of the dominant mode of the EASWJ in late summer extend more to the west and north than in early summer, and induce anomalous weather extremes in the corresponding areas. The dominant mode of the EASWJ in late sum-mer is characterized by anomalous westerlies centered over the south of Lake Baikal and anomalous easterlies centered over Central China, which is favorable for the occurrence of precipitation extremes over northern and southern China and humid heat extremes over most areas of China except parts of southern China and northern Xinjiang Province. The variability of the EASWJ can influence precipitation and humid heat extremes by driving anomalous vertical motion and water vapor transport over the corresponding areas in early and late summer.

The aims of this study were to investigate the spatiotemporal variation of N-DAMO bacteria and its driving factors in a drinking reservoir which are strongly affected by human consumption. Methods Cloning analyses were used to study thepmoAand 16S rRNA genes of N-DAMO bacteria. Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were used to investigate the bacterial composition and structure. Redundancy analyses (RDA) and spearman's correlations analyses were applied to analyze the relationships between bacterial distribution and environmental factors. Result There were remarkable spatial variations of N-DAMO bacteria in winter. Shannon biodiversity of 16S rRNA genes was higher in winter than that in summer. Compared with other freshwater ecosystems, there was higher diversity of N-DAMO bacteria in Miyun Reservoir. The N-DAMO bacterial communities (16S rRNA andpmoAgenes) in sampling sites near to dam were different from the bacterial communities in other sampling sites. The N-DAMO bacterial community structure in dam areas may be associated with the water column depth in front of the dam. Moreover, Spearman's correlations revealed that DO, NO3--N, NO2--N, and NH4+-N in interstitial water and sediment were potential determinant factors influencing the diversity of N-DAMO bacteria (16S rRNA andpmoAgenes). Conclusion There were distinct seasonal variations in 16S rRNA and spatial variations inpmoAgenes. N-DAMO bacterial communities contained novelMethylomirabilis oxyfera-like pmoAgenes in Miyun Reservoir. Nitrogen (NO2--N, NO3--N, and NH4+-N) were the dominant factor influencing the N-DAMO bacterial community structure in the drinking reservoir. N-DAMO bacterial community structure in dam areas indicates that water depth and DO might be the dominant factor influencing the N-DAMO bacterial communities in the reservoir.					; wang, xiaoyan/ABE-3431-2021	Liu, Yang/0000-0001-8959-1529; Du, Yi/0000-0002-4302-5369													1590-4261	1869-2044				JUN 25	2020	70	1							42	10.1186/s13213-020-01578-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13213-020-01578-5													WOS:000545743200001

We present a high-resolution marine sediment record off Tanzania to provide insights into the climatic conditions of inland East Africa during the Holocene. Major element ratios (i.e., log-ratios of Fe/Ca and Ti/Ca), derived from X-Ray Fluorescence scanning, have been employed to document variations in humidity in East Africa. Our results show that the AHP is represented by two humid phases: an intense humid period from the beginning of the Holocene to 8 ka (AHP I); and a moderate humid period spanning from 8 to 5.5 ka (AHP II). On the basis of our geochemical record and regime detection, the termination of the AHP initiated at 5.5 ka and ceased around 3.5 ka. Combined with other paleoclimatic records around East Africa, we suggest that the humid conditions in this region responded to Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer insolation. The AHP I and II might have been related to an eastward shift of the Congo Air Boundary and warmer conditions in the western Indian Ocean, which resulted in additional moisture being delivered from the Atlantic and Indian Oceans during the NH summer and autumn, respectively. We further note a drought event throughout East Africa north of 10 degrees S around 8.2 ka, which may have been related to the southward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone in response to the NH cooling event.

The circulation and evolutionary dynamics of the virus remain largely unknown. Methods: We performed surveillance for H5N8 in Qinghai Lake in China since the emergence of the virus (from 2016 to 2018). By analyzing recovered viruses in Qinghai Lake and all related viruses worldwide (449 strains), we identified the genotypes, estimated their genesis and reassortment, and evaluated their global distribution and transmission. Results: Through surveillance of wild migratory birds around Qinghai Lake between 2016 and 2018, we revealed that the H5N8 was introduced into Qinghai Lake bird populations (QH-H5N8), with distinct gene constellations in 2016 and 2017. A global analysis of QH-H5N8-related viruses showed that avian influenza viruses with low pathogenicity in wild birds contributed to the high diversity of genotypes; the major reassortment events possibly occurred during the 2016 breeding season and the following winters. Conclusions: Continued circulation of QH-H5N8-related viruses among wild birds has resulted in the global distribution of high genotypic diversity. Thus, these viruses pose an ongoing threat to wild and domestic bird populations and warrant continuous surveillance. (C) 2019 The British Infection Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Poyang Lake becomes fragmented in winter, which forms many seasonal sub-lakes every year, and have different environmental characteristics. These sub-lakes significantly impact winter bird habitats and result in susceptibility to various changes, because birds have different distribution responses. A total of 24 sub-lakes were surveyed from one to five vantage points using point count methods in each sub-lake with binoculars, monocular, and a spotting scope for four consecutive winter seasons. The multi-site dissimilarity Sorensen index measures overlapped between two populations, and the R software "iNEXT" package was used to evaluate the sample coverage test of the study area. We observed 58 wintering waterbird species belonging to 9 orders and 15 families from 2016 to 2020. Spearman correlation analysis showed that the species richness of wintering waterbirds was significantly positively correlated with the sub-lake areas and associated with the richness of habitat type. The WNODF analyses were considerably correlated for sites of waterbirds, mainly with the abundance of forage and conservation of habitat form. The outcomes of this study showed that Maying Lake has the highest local beta diversity, whereas Dacha Lake has the lowest local beta diversity contribution (0.007). This study's findings demonstrate Poyang Lake's role in waterbird the habitat suitability of waterbirds, especially for foraging and conservation.

J	Obertegger, U; Obrador, B; Flaim, G				Obertegger, Ulrike; Obrador, Biel; Flaim, Giovanna			Dissolved oxygen dynamics under ice: Three winters of high-frequency data from Lake Tovel, Italy	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Under-ice dissolved oxygen (DO) metabolism and DO depletion are poorly understood, limiting our ability to predict how changing winter conditions will affect lake ecosystems. We analyzed under-ice DO dynamics based on high-frequency (HF) data at two depths (5 and 25 m) for three winters (January-March 2014, 2015, and 2016) in oligotrophic Lake Tovel (1178 m above sea level; maximum depth 39 m). Specifically, we assessed diel metabolic rates based on HF data of DO, temperature, and light for winter 2016 and seasonal DO depletion rates based on HF data of DO for all three winters. For 2016, calculations of metabolic rates were possible only for 34% and 3% of days at 5 and 25 m, respectively; these metabolic rates generally indicated net heterotrophy at both depths. Low success in modeling metabolic rates was attributed to low diel DO variability and anomalous diel DO patterns, probably linked to under-ice physical processes. Seasonal DO patterns for the three winters showed increasing, decreasing, or stable DO trends at 5 m while at 25 m patterns always showed decreasing DO trends but with different rates. Our multiyear study permitted us to hypothesize that the observed intraannual and interannual differences in DO depletion can be attributed to variable snow cover determining the penetration of radiation and thus photosynthesis. This study brings new insights to DO dynamics in ice-covered systems, highlights the challenges linked to under-ice lake metabolism, and advocates for a modeling approach that includes physical processes. Plain Language Summary More than half of the world's lakes freeze in winter, but scientists still know little about what happens under ice. A major challenge in dealing with winter conditions is the difficulty of sampling when snow and ice often restrict site accessibility. The use of underwater sensors that continuously measure temperature, oxygen, and light has partly overcome this obstacle. However in most lakes, sensors are removed during winter because ice breakup can damage this expensive equipment; Lake Tovel is one of the few lakes where sensors are deployed all year round. Oxygen is needed by organisms for respiration, and how much oxygen is still available in the lake when ice melts will have important implications for the rest of the year. We analyzed 3 years of under-ice oxygen data and show that oxygen can increase at 5 m depth but always decreased at 25 m depth. Climate change predictions indicate less snow in the Alps and earlier ice breakup. We show how water movement and snow influence under-ice oxygen. Our study brings new insights to oxygen dynamics in ice-covered systems and highlights the challenges in understanding the biological and physical factors that influence oxygen in ice-covered lakes.

J	Mageswaran, R; Ponnusamy, P				Mageswaran, Raghul; Ponnusamy, Porchelvan			Impact of nutrient dynamics on chlorophyll-a concentrations in non-interconnected lakes: A study in the Vellore and Chennai region	RESULTS IN ENGINEERING												This study examines the physicochemical dynamics and their impact on chlorophyll-a concentrations in six noninterconnected lakes between Vellore and Chennai city. Data were collected every quarterly in 2024, covering key parameters such as pH, temperature, turbidity, total phosphate, total nitrate, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, and chlorophyll-a. An integrated approach was employed, combining physio-chemical and biological analysis, Principal Component Analysis and GIS mapping. This study fills a research gap by focusing on non-interconnected lakes and demonstrates the importance of regional-scale influences. The experimental results show varying water quality conditions with higher chlorophyll-a concentrations during summer, while nutrient concentrations peak in winter and post-monsoon season. Noninterconnected lakes exhibited uniform seasonal patterns in nutrient levels. PCA identified turbidity, total phosphate, and total nitrate as major contributors to chlorophyll-a variability. During summer, PCA explained 40.02 % of the variance, with high loadings for chlorophyll-a (0.892), total phosphate (0.776), total nitrate (0.693), and turbidity (0.582). Similarly, in post-monsoon season, PCA explained 39.12 % of the variance, with high loadings for chlorophyll-a (0.879), total phosphate (0.812), total nitrate (0.732), and turbidity (0.659), highlighting their contribution to eutrophication. Spatial distribution maps for 2024 indicate that sample 1 from each lake showed higher turbidity, chlorophyll-a, total phosphate, and total nitrate, implying these parameters are critical drivers of eutrophication. Among the lakes, Kaveripakkam exhibited the highest values for these parameters, which needs management strategies. This study helps understand how water quality changes over time and across different locations, providing a basis for better-managing nutrients in freshwater ecosystems.																				2590-1230				MAR	2025	25								104315	10.1016/j.rineng.2025.104315	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rineng.2025.104315		FEB 2025											WOS:001425550900001

Chromatium and Chlorobium accounted for most of the bacterial population. The bacteria were present throughout the year despite complete mixing of the lake during fall and winter. This was possible because the sulfide production in the sediment was high enough to make the lake anaerobic to the very surface. Solar radiation, temperature and biomass of Chromatium sp. were important in determining pigment concentrations as shown by correlation analysis. Sulfide concentration and biomass of Chlorobium spp. were unimportant. A path analysis was performed to determine what percentage of the variability of pigments could be explained by the variables studied. Since a high percentage could be explained, solar radiation, temperature and biomass of Chromatium sp. were the main variables.

Lake Erie has the largest median AMIC (94%) followed by Lakes Superior (80%), Huron (63%), Michigan (33%), and Ontario (21%). The frequency distribution of AMICs is negatively skewed for Lakes Superior and Erie and positively skewed for Lakes Michigan and Ontario. Temporal and spatial patterns of typical and extreme AMICs is presented within the context of long-term average air temperatures and lake bathymetry. The variation of spatially averaged ice concentration with discrete depth ranges are discussed for each lake for the upper and lower end of the typical range of AMIC values. In general, ice concentration decreases with increasing depth ranges for a given winter. A decrease in the gradient of ice concentration with depths was also observed with an increase in the AMIC from winter 1983 to winter 1984. A temporal trend in the AMICs supports the hypothesis of three ice cover regimes over the past 39 winters. Approximately 44% of the highest quartile (10 highest) AMICs for the Great Lakes occurred during the 6-winter period: 1977-1982 providing evidence of a higher ice cover regime during this period relative to the 14 winters before them (1963-1976) and the 19 winters after them (1983-2001). Winter 1998 established new low AMIC extremes, and the AMIC averaged over the 1998-2001 winters is the lowest for the period of record on four of the five Great Lakes. These recent trends taken together are noteworthy as they may be harbingers of a period of even lower AMICs in the 21st Century.																			0165-0009					MAR	2003	57	1-2					185	204		10.1023/A:1022140604052	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1022140604052													WOS:000181340200010

The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation, in particular, has been used in various climate and hydrology based studies around the world. While having wide possibilities, TRMM rainfall estimates are found to be inconsistent with the ground based rainfall measurements at various locations such as the southwest coast and Himalayan region of India, northeast parts of USA, Lake Victoria in Africa, La Plata basin in South America, etc. In this study, the applicability of TRMM estimates is evaluated over the Upper Ganga Basin (Himalayan catchment) by comparing against gauge-based India Meteorological Department (IMD) gridded precipitation records. Apart from temporal evaluation, the ability of TRMM in capturing spatial distribution is also examined using three statistical parameters namely correlation coefficient (r), mean absolute error (MAE) and relative bias (RBIAS). In the results, the dual nature of bias is evident in TRMM precipitation with rainfall magnitude falling in the range from 100 to 370 mm representing positive bias, whereas, rainfall magnitude above 400 mm, approximately, representing negative bias. The Quantile Mapping (QM) approach has been used to correct the TRMM dataset from these biases. The raw TRMM precipitation is found to be fairly correlated with IMD rainfall for post-monsoon and winter season with R-2 values of 0.65 and 0.57, respectively. The R-2 value of 0.41 is obtained for the monsoon season, whereas least correlation is found for the pre-monsoon season with an R-2 value of 0.24. Moreover, spatial distribution of rainfall during post-monsoon and winter season is captured adequately; however, the limited efficiency of TRMM is reflected for pre-monsoon and monsoon season.

The treatments were a combination of two methods of fertilizer application (total amount in fall, and 2/3 in fall + 1/3 in spring) at three rates (0, 100, and 200 kg N/ha) with four replications. Concentrations of NH4+, NO3-, NO2-, P, and Cl- and pH were determined in all water samples. Runoff water quality was not influenced by fertilizer application in either area. Chemical parameters for water did not differ along the selected watercourses in area B, while in area A they were higher in the samples taken near Lake Koronia than in the samples taken upstream, indicating that the watercourses are polluted downstream by nonagricultural sources. The differences in wheat yields between the 100 and 200 kg N/ha application rates were not high. These results call for better fertilizer management in order to achieve better yields and to diminish the possibility to have negative effects to the environment.

J	KLUT, ME; STOCKNER, JG				KLUT, ME; STOCKNER, JG			PICOPLANKTON ASSOCIATIONS IN AN ULTRA-OLIGOTROPHIC LAKE ON VANCOUVER-ISLAND, BRITISH-COLUMBIA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Epiphytic associations or "microaggregates" of picoplankton with larger phytoplankton in Sproat Lake, British Columbia, occurred in the epilimnion throughout the 1-yr study, but were most frequently seen at times of severe nutrient limitation in summer and autumn. Both bacterial and algal picoplankton epiphytes were attached to the cell surface of algal hosts by either fine protrusions or by their fibrillar extracellular matrix (glycocalyx). This surface coat increased in thickness as ambient nutrient concentrations became limiting, and harboured a range of heterogeneous organic and inorganic particles and phytoplankters. The phytoplanktonic host cells for these picoplankton associations included filamentous cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates, chlorophytes, coccolithophores, and diatoms. Under controlled nutrient-depleted conditions, the filamentous nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Anabaena flos-aquae became a common host of chroococcoid cyanobacterium. Some picoplankters were endophytic within the cytoplasm and vacuoles of protozoa and microflagellates, serving either as prey or as symbionts. These associations are thought to facilitate rapid carbon and nutrient recycling in pelagic ecosystems.																			0706-652X					JUN	1991	48	6					1092	1099		10.1139/f91-129	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f91-129													WOS:A1991FV22600018

This study simulates the variation of water balance in the Ghorra Playa, Eastern Tunisia, over the period extending from September 2017 to August 2020. The playa is a seasonal habitat for a number of migratory bird species and its watershed is of vital agricultural importance. Water balance estimations were performed using two different approaches: remote sensing-based analyses (Sentinel-2B, Global Precipitation Measurements (GPM) and Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWS-NET)) and modelling founded on field data. The playa presents an average annual water balance of 1.1 million cubic metres. Water inflows come from direct rainfall, mostly in the fall and spring seasons. Groundwater flow into the playa significantly influenced the pattern of water flux (81%). The annual, seasonal and monthly water budget simulations show reasonably good agreement between the remote sensing-based analysis and the hydrological modelling exercise.

J	Spânu, S; Florea, M				Spanu, Simona; Florea, Marin			THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGES ON THE VILLAGES NEAR COMANA PROTECTED AREA, GIURGIU COUNTY, ROMANIA	SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES MANAGEMENT ECONOMIC ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT												The main atmospheric climate parameters are important for the daily and seasonal variation of the parameters of the Comana Puddle aquariums. The anomalous variation of temperatures, precipitation and evaporation induces a fluctuation in the volume of water from the pond and the river Neajlov. Atmospheric temperature and precipitation directly affect winter phenomena and breakdown processes during the summer period, with significant effects on the agriculture, the most vulnerable domain on climate changes. In the hilly or hill area, the amount of rainfall decreases, thus influencing the water intake in these aquariums. The high warming time of the heat season leads to an increase in evaporation values, so that a water deficit is recorded in the hillside, hillside and plain areas, which also entails a loss in the volume of water in the lagoons. These seasonal fluctuations directly affect the limbic or aquatic fauna, but also the agriculture. In the cold season winter phenomena (ice bridge, ice on the shore, slopes, snowballs) and blocking water as snow, creates a deficiency in the water supply of lakes, ponds, puddles and swamps. This paper analysed the impact of climatic changes but also the possibilities of the recovery a part of the gloss of water, a gloss that existed years ago and which was greatly diminished after the work done downstream changed the hydrological balance of the area. This effect adds to the fact that climate change has made it possible for the volume of evaporation to be increased and sometimes to exceed the volume of precipitation.

Various pollutants might accumulate in the lake continuously owing to the concentration effect under high evaporation but low precipitation over the entire area, typically for sedimentary cyclic elements such as phosphorus (P). However, the detailed transportation, sedimentation, and internal release mechanisms of P in the diversion input lakes remain unclear. This study conducted a year -long investigation of the littoral wetlands and open water areas of the shallow Lake Hengshui in the semi -humid region of North China. Results revealed that the average total P concentrations in the water and surficial sediment reached as high as 0.202 mg L -1 and 878.21 mg kg -1 in summer. The high water P levels in the lake were mainly regulated by the high internal P loading during summer and autumn, with the internal P loading being approximately nine times the external P loading. The littoral wetland area serves as a higher sedimentation sink and release source of P than the open water area. The concentrated P was continuously transported to the littoral wetland area through detritus burial, coprecipitation, and deposition of suspended particles. The release of P was mainly controlled by the dissolution of redoxsensitive Fe -P and Org-P at high temperatures and organic matter mineralization in the sediment, accompanied by the potential release capacity of apatite P (Ca -P). Future management of eutrophication and P levels in similar diversion input lakes should pay more attention to the high internal P loading in the sediment and the differentiated sedimentation and release processes in the littoral wetland and open water areas.

Iggy; Badihi, Naama; Amouyal, Avishag; Reichman, Oren			The influence of irrigation with Lake Kinneret water on the chemistry of soils in the headwater basin	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												The farming areas in the catchment of Lake Kinneret basin are irrigated with Dan Spring waters, characterized by a concentration of 10 mg/L of Cl. Climate change simulation predicts that by the year 2050, the flow of the headwater springs will drop by 20%, a finding that poses a significant threat to the future of farming in the basin. The Israel Water Authority proposed irrigating Kinneret water after dilution with the Dan Spring water. To test the possible ramifications on soil health, three irrigation treatments were used, including Kinneret water (300 mg/L Cl-), mix-diluted water (150 mg/L Cl-), and control irrigation with Dan water (10 mg/L Cl-). The experiment was conducted in a factorial structure (5 common soils x 3 treatments x 6 repetitions) in 25-L pots. A total of 945 weekly leachates were sampled, and Cl, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) were determined. To determine the exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), soil samples were collected from two depths (0-10 cm and 30-40 cm). Significant differences were found between the three treatments in all salinity and sodicity parameters (p < 0.001) measured in leachates and soils. The difference between the treatments was most pronounced in the summer when the Kinneret-irrigated soils exhibited means of EC, 3584 <mu>S/cm; Cl, 1694 mg/L; SAR, 10.07 meq/L-0.5; and ESP, 8.2%. Changes in salinity and sodicity in leachates and soils corresponded well to changes in evaporation. This test study strongly suggests that changing water sources for irrigation because of climate change may increase soil salinity across the entire Mediterranean region.																			0361-5995	1435-0661				MAY	2025	89	3							e70087	10.1002/saj2.70087	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/saj2.70087													WOS:001517438200020

In large ice-covered lakes, wind-induced oscillations have been found to play a major role in horizontal flows. Here, we report recurrent, wind-driven, barotropic seiches in a small lake with a thick (similar to 4 m) permanent ice-cover. Between 2010 and 2016, we recorded 10.5- to 13-min oscillations of the hydrostatic water level in Lake Hoare, McMurdo Dry Valleys, East Antarctica, using pressure transducers moored to the lake bottom and suspended from the ice cover. Theoretical calculations showed a barotropic seiche should have a period of 12.6 min. Barotropic seiches were most frequent during high wind events (> 5 m s(-1)) in winter months (February-November). The period increased during summer months (December-January) when fast ice thinned and melted along the shoreline.					; Doran, Peter/ABS-7911-2022	Pujara, Nimish/0000-0002-0274-4527; 														2378-2242				FEB	2022	7	1					26	33		10.1002/lol2.10226	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lol2.10226		DEC 2021											WOS:000730581100001

In this paper, we present our initial over the air test results of FB-MC-SS for a testing campaign that began in Spring 2016. These tests are performed for a 190 mile near vertical incidence skywave (NVIS) link from Idaho Falls, Idaho to Salt Lake City, Utah. Two waveform bandwidths are examined; a 24 kHz and a 200 kHz bandwidth. The test results demonstrate that FB-MC-SS is robust and well-suited for HF communications. Reliable data recovery is demonstrated at signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values of as low as -20 dB. In addition, the results show the improvements in performance and stealthiness of communications as transmit signal bandwidth increases, while the bit rate and transmit power are kept fixed.																			2155-7578		978-1-5090-3781-0				2016							711	716																WOS:000391433600121
J	Hillbricht-Ilkowska, A				Hillbricht-Ilkowska, A			Eutrophication rate of lakes in the Jorka river system (Masurian Lakeland, Poland): Long-term changes and trophic correlations	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												No trends were found in long-term variation (between the 1970s and the 1990s) of basic trophic parametres (TP,TN. chlorophyll concentration, algal biomass. and water transparency) in five lakes of the river-lake system typical of a lakeland, hilly area (the Jorka river system, Masurian Lakeland). Recently, this lake chain maintains the historically developed trophic differentiation between deep. mesotrophic lake close to headwaters and shallow, eutrophic lake close to the outlet of the river. The only change found is the replacement of cyanobacteria dominating in the 1970s by dinoflagellates dominating in the 1990s. A strong correlation was found between TP loading to lakes and in-lake TP concentration in spring periods, however no correlation existed between TP and other trophic indices. On the other hand, the interrelations between SD. chlorophyll, and algal biomass were highly significant in summer periods and marginally significant in spring periods. This pattern was also found in other groups of takes in the region. It is concluded that in hilly lakeland region, the river-lake systems draining small mosaic catchments are resistant to the further eutrophication (low nutrient loading. no point sources) and for this reason they tend to maintain the trophic conditions developed in the remote past.																			1505-2249						2002	50	4					475	487																WOS:000180144900005

The average CH4 flux was much less than that reported from reservoirs in tropic and temperate regions. The photosynthesis of phytoplankton dominated the diel gas fluxes during alga bloom in spring and summer. The maximum monthly flux occurred in June 2010 and corresponded to the lowest water level. Water temperature, sediment temperature, and TOC did not have significant correlation with the monthly CH4 fluxes. Continuously decreasing hydrostatic pressure and the low water level resulted in more CH4 emission at the sediment-water during the discharging period, and thus increases the CH4 effluxes because the diffusion time through a thin water column is shorter and less CH4 may be oxidized compared with that in a long water column.

Collection consisted of gas and particle samples. Total PCB concentrations varied from 1.820 ng/m3 in the summer to 0.135 ng/m3 in the winter, with an average of 92% in the vapor phase. Sixty-six congeners were found in more than 50% of the gas and particle samples. These data were than used to gain insight with respect to long-term and seasonal time trends, source-receptor congener fractionation, and atmospheric residence times. No discernable reduction in atmospheric PCB levels is apparent during the last 7 years in this location. Congener patterns resemble, but are not identical with, those of Aroclor 1242. Calculations indicate that average residence time of PCB congeners is on the order of a few months. The short residence time combined with relatively constant annual average PCB levels indicated repeated cycling between earth and atmosphere before final removal from the environmentally mobile reservoir.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				SEP	1989	23	9					1138	1148		10.1021/es00067a012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es00067a012													WOS:A1989AN10100021

Cultural meromixis: Effects of road salt on the chemical stratification of an urban kettle lake	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Saline runoff from application of road salt deicers has the potential to create persistent density gradients in urban freshwater lakes, resulting in significant changes to physical mixing and biogeochemical cycling. In this study, the seasonal influence of road salt influx on the geochemical cycling of a small, urban kettle lake is examined. Water column samples were collected approximately twice per month for fifteen months and analyzed for temperature, pH, conductivity, major ions, nutrients and redox-sensitive solutes. The lake water column was redox-stratified with high concentrations of dissolved Mn(II), Fe(II), ammonium, phosphate and, during some periods, sulfide and methane in the hypolimnion. Bottom water anoxia was persistent throughout the entire sampling period. Concentrations of sodium and chloride, which correlated strongly with conductivity, were over a hundred times greater compared with levels in nearby rural lakes. Conductivity, chloride and calculated density profiles indicated the presence of a pycnocline at similar to 9 m depth that persisted throughout the sampling period. The chemical data demonstrate that road salt input has caused the lake to become meromictic, with a complete lack of fall and spring turnover. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	RODRIGUEZ, MA				RODRIGUEZ, MA			AN EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS OF COMMUNITY STRUCTURE REGULATION IN PERIPHYTON	OIKOS												Regulation of community structure was studied in an oligotrophic lake through experiments involving convergence of attached microalgal communities with initially differing structures. Convergence of a control and two experimental communities indicated that community structure was regulated, apparently toward a single. highly dynamic equilibrium. The rate of convergence was similar in the two experiments. and thus was independent of initial community structure. This rate was commensurate with average cell division rates measured independently. The estimated "characteristic response time", an aggregated community parameter, was 11 wk, indicating that the community could track yearly cyclical environmental variation, albeit with a lag. Environmental changes occurring over periods shorter than 11 wk, such as those observed in spring and autumn, may have left the community far from equilibrium for extended periods of time. By slowing cell division rates, phosphorus scarcity may have been the main factor underlying the sluggishness of community-level responses. The experimental protocol described here provides a means of quantifying community recovery and of estimating the rate of adjustment to equilibrium for periphyton communities.

In southwestern Alaska, alder-derived nutrients (ADNs) are increasing as alder cover expands in response to climate warming, while climate change and habitat degradation are reducing marine-derived nutrients (MDNs) in salmon-spawning habitats. To assess the relative influences of ADN and MDN on aquatic microbial community structure and function, we analyzed lake chemistry, bacterial community structure, and microbial metabolism in 13 lakes with varying alder cover and salmon abundance in southwestern Alaska. We conducted bioassays to determine microbial nutrient limitation and physical factors modulating microbial response to nutrient inputs (+N, +P and +NP treatments). Seasonal shifts in bacterial community structure (F = 7.47, P < 0.01) coincided with changes in lake nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations (r(2) = 0.19 and 0.16, both P < 0.05), and putrescine degradation (r(2) = 0.13, P = 0.06), suggesting the influx and microbial use of MDN. Higher microbial metabolism occurred in summer than spring, coinciding with salmon runs. Increased microbial metabolism occurred in lakes where more salmon spawned. Microbial metabolic activity was unrelated to alder cover, likely because ADN provides less resource diversity than MDN. When nutrients were added to spring samples, there was greater substrate use by microbial communities from lakes with elevated Chl a concentrations and large relative catchment areas (beta estimates for all treatments > 0.56, all P < 0.07). Thus, physical watershed and lake features mediate the effects of nutrient subsidies on aquatic microbial metabolic activity.					; Kent, Angela/D-6124-2011; Nelson, David/D-5596-2009	Fraterrigo, Jennifer/0000-0002-0357-1007; Kent, Angela/0000-0003-1837-2382; Devotta, Denise/0000-0002-7618-9482; Nelson, David/0000-0003-2755-5535													0029-8549	1432-1939				JUL	2022	199	3					711	724		10.1007/s00442-022-05207-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-022-05207-7		JUN 2022						35739283					WOS:000814973600001
J	de Klein, JJM; Koelmans, AA				de Klein, Jeroen J. M.; Koelmans, Albert A.			Quantifying seasonal export and retention of nutrients in West European lowland rivers at catchment scale	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												To set accurate critical values for the protection of lakes and coastal areas, it is crucial to know the seasonal variation of nutrient exports from rivers. This article presents an improved method for estimating export and in-stream nutrient retention and its seasonal variation. For 13 lowland river catchments in Western Europe, inputs to surface water and exports were calculated on a monthly basis. The catchments varied in size (21 to 486 km(2)), while annual in-stream retention ranged from 23 to 84% for N and 39 to 72% for P. A novel calculation method is presented that quantifies monthly exports from lowland rivers based on an annual load to the river system. Inputs in the calculation are annual emission to the surface waters, average monthly river discharge, average monthly water temperature and fraction of surface water area in the catchment. The method accounts for both seasonal variation of emission to the surface water and seasonal in-stream retention. The agreement between calculated values and calibration data was high (N: r(2) = 0.93; p < 0.001 and P: r(2) = 0.81; p < 0.001). Validation of the model also showed good results with model efficiencies for the separate catchments ranging from 31 to 95% (average 76%). This indicates that exports of nitrogen and phosphorus on a monthly basis can be calculated with few input data for a range of West European lowland rivers. Further analysis showed that retention in summer is higher than that in winter, resulting in lower summer nutrient concentrations than that calculated with an average annual input. This implies that accurate evaluation of critical thresholds for eutrophication effects must account for seasonal variation in hydrology and nutrient loading. Our quantification method thus may improve the modelling of eutrophication effects in standing waters.

Since especially the spring ecosystem dynamics determines the successive state of shallow lakes, such impact could depend on seasonality in benthivore activity patterns. However, we do not yet know to what extent the activity of large-bodied benthivorous fish affects lake turbidity across the year. In order to investigate seasonal dynamics in bream activity and its impact on water turbidity under natural conditions, bream daily activity was studied in a small (39 ha) shallow Danish lake using passive biotelemetry technology, i.e. a modified Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT)-tag antenna system. We tracked the activity of 448 benthivorous bream over a period of four years (2012 to 2016) and during the same period wind conditions, water turbidity and temperature was measured. Results showed a clear relationship between bream activity and water turbidity at water temperature below 15 degrees C indicating that winter season activity of benthivorous bream may play an important role for maintaining lake ecosystems in a turbid state. Also wind speed and wind direction affected water turbidity, suggesting that wind induced resuspension can be important even in small shallow lakes. This is to our knowledge the first full-scale study under natural conditions to describe how bream activity influence lake turbidity on a day-to-day basis. Our findings also add a seasonal component to previous findings by showing that benthivorous feeding bream have the potential to increase water turbidity also in the winter season and thereby, ultimately, impact ecosystem functioning within shallow lakes.					; Skov, Christian/X-6511-2019; Baktoft, Henrik/E-6581-2011	Skov, Christian/0000-0002-8547-6520; Baktoft, Henrik/0000-0002-3644-4960													1129-5767	1723-8633					2019	78	2					259	269		10.4081/jlimnol.2019.1883	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2019.1883													WOS:000500804800010

A tsunami deposit found in cores from five coastal lakes located near the North Cape in Finnmark-rests on an erosional unconformity and consists of graded sand layers and re-deposited organic remains. Rip-up clasts of lake mud, peat and soil suggest strong erosion of the lake floor and neighbouring land. Inundation reached at least 500 m inland and minimum vertical run-up has been reconstructed to 3-4 m. In this part of the Arctic coastal lakes are usually covered by >1 m of solid lake ice in winter. The significant erosion and deposition of rip-up clasts indicate that the lakes were ice free and that the ground was probably not frozen. We suggest that the Storegga slide and ensuing tsunami happened sometime in the summer season, between April and October. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

However, so far no cooling event has been found in paleoclimate records responding to Meltwater Pulse 1A. Here we reconstruct winter temperature based on sedimentary diatoms from Huguangyan Maar Lake in tropical China. The results show that winter temperature dropped by at least 6 degrees C within similar to 100 years at 14.8 0.02 ka BP, coeval with the onset of Meltwater Pulse 1A, within dating uncertainty. We argue that Meltwater Pulse 1A weakened the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), resulting in abrupt severe cooling in the Northern Hemisphere that caused a severe winter temperature drop in East Asia by strengthening the winter monsoon. We propose that extreme cooling in winter temperature triggered the BOlling warming by stopping the freshwater release from the ice-sheet, triggering the AMOC to recover quickly and causing the BOlling event as an overshoot under gradual forcing.

Based on the Google Earth Engine platform, we use 165 Landsat images from the summer and autumn seasons (May-November) of 2000, 2010, and 2018 as data sources to calculate the RSEI, which represents the quality of the eco-environment, and then analyze the factors influencing the spatial heterogeneity of the eco-environment and the relationship between eco-environment and land-use changes based on RSEI. The results showed the following: (1) From 2000 to 2018, the overall ecological environment quality of the Taihu Lake Basin showed a stage of rapid decline (2000-2010) and a stage of slow decline (2010-2018). (2) The factors were ranked in order of their explanatory power for the spatial heterogeneity of the RSEI: land-use (0.594) > population density (0.418) > slope (0.309) > elevation (0.308) > GDP (0.304) > temperature (0.233) > precipitation (0.208). An interactive effect was found for each factor of the RSEI, which is mainly represented by a mutual enhancement. (3) From 2000 to 2010, the rapid urban expansion was the main reason for the deterioration of ecological quality. From 2010 to 2018, urban expansion slowed down, and the trend of ecological quality deterioration was effectively curbed. Therefore, promoting the intensive use of land and reducing construction land expansion are key to ensuring sustainable regional socio-economic development.																				2071-1050				MAY	2022	14	9							5642	10.3390/su14095642	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14095642													WOS:000794612500001

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANTS IN EXCREMENT OF IOWA'S NESTING AND WINTERING BALD EAGLES (HALIAEETUS LEUCOCEPHALUS)	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) were rare only a few decades ago but have undergone a spectacular recovery range-wide. While their numbers have increased, there is concern about exposure of Bald Eagles to environmental contaminants. We collected excrement from nesting and wintering Bald Eagles in Iowa to examine their exposure to several contaminants and tested for differences as a function of space, time, and breeding status. We detected aluminum, copper, manganese, and zinc at levels above the quantitation limit (QL) in most excrement samples. These elements are all essential micronutrients "normally found in living organisms. Arsenic and selenium are essential micronutrients for which fewer samples had levels above the QL. We also detected non-essential elements barium, cadmium, lead, and mercury in excrement samples, although only one sample had a cadmium level above the QL and only 26% of samples had lead levels above the QL. Geometric mean contaminant levels in excrement samples collected from nesting eagles during the spring were higher than for samples collected in the winter for aluminum, barium, copper, manganese, and zinc. The only difference we detected in contaminant levels in excrement samples was in manganese (higher for nest sites along the Mississippi River) and selenium (lower for nest sites along the Mississippi River) versus nest sites not associated with the Mississippi River. We also found that non-breeding eagles had higher levels of barium and manganese than nesting eagles. Our results can serve as a baseline for comparison with future studies investigating exposure of Bald Eagles to environmental contaminants.																			1559-4491	1938-5447				MAR	2017	129	1					148	154		10.1676/1559-4491-129.1.148	http://dx.doi.org/10.1676/1559-4491-129.1.148													WOS:000396646200015

Recently, new laser-based technology has been developed at the University of Guelph for the accurate, high-speed measurement of the concentration and fluxes of trace gases. This tunable diode laser trace gas analyzer system (TDLTGAS) has been used to continuously monitor nitrous oxide fluxes from several agricultural surfaces, in a research program initiated in 1991. The natural event that caused the largest fluxes was soil thawing during the spring on non-cropped plots (bare soil, bare soil plus manure, and ploughed-down alfalfa). Monthly average fluxes of between 70 and 110 ng m(-2) s(-1) were observed during March and April of 1993 and 1994. Emissions from alfalfa and bluegrass plots were between 2 and 6 ng m(-2) s(-1) during spring thaw. During the winter of 1993/94 emissions ranged from 2 to 6 ng m(-2) s(-1) for snow covered plots, except for the ploughed-down alfalfa which averaged 30 +/- 3.5 ng m(-2) s(-1). A summary of methane fluxes measured by our research group using the TDLTGAS over agriculture surfaces including rice paddies, and natural surfaces such as northern wetlands, lakes, and the boreal forest are also discussed.

According to stomach analyses, Cladocera are the main food organisms of the populations in Lake Thun and Lake Biel during the period of growth (limited to May-Sept./Oct.). In winter and spring they feed on Copepods and bottom organisms. The composition of the food differs little between populations. In the past 25 yr the Coregonus spp. in the 2 lakes experienced a considerable improvement in growth. This improvement is mainly due to better growth rates during the first 2 yr of life. The decrease, mainly of the stocks of Lake Biel, is probably caused by diseases and parasites.																			0036-7842						1979	41	1					64	93		10.1007/BF02551760	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02551760													WOS:A1979HU05100003
J	Huziy, O; Sushama, L				Huziy, O.; Sushama, L.			Lake-river and lake-atmosphere interactions in a changing climate over Northeast Canada	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Lakes influence the regional climate and hydrology in a number of ways and therefore they should be represented in climate models in a realistic manner. Lack of representation of lakes in models can lead to errors in simulated energy and water fluxes, for lake-rich regions. This study focuses on the assessment of the impact of climate change on lakes and hydrology as well as on the influence of lakes on projected changes to regional climate and surface hydrology, particularly streamflows, for Northeast Canada. To this end, transient climate change simulations spanning the 1950-2100 period are performed, with and without lakes, with the fifth generation of the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM5), driven by the Canadian Earth System Model (CanESM2) at the lateral boundaries for Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. An additional CRCM5 simulation, driven by European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis Interim (ERA-Interim) for the 1980-2010 period, is performed in order to assess performance and boundary forcing errors. Performance errors are assessed by comparing the ERA-Interim-driven simulation with available observation datasets, for the 1980-2010 period, for selected variables: 2-m air temperature, total precipitation, snow water equivalent and streamflow. The validation results indicate reasonable model performance over the study region. Boundary forcing errors are studied by comparing ERA-Interim-driven simulation with the one driven by CanESM2 for the current 1980-2010 period, to identify regions and seasons for which projected changes should be interpreted with extra caution. Comparison of projected changes from the CRCM5 simulations with and without lakes suggest that the presence of lakes results in a dampening of projected increases to 2-m air temperature for all seasons almost everywhere in the study domain, with maximum dampening of the order of 2 A degrees C occurring during winter, mostly in the vicinity of the lakes. As for streamflows, projected increases to spring streamflows, based on the simulation with lakes, are found to be smaller than that without lakes and this is due to the storage effect of lakes. Similarly, lower decreases in summer streamflows in future climate are noted in the simulation with lakes due to the gradual release of snowmelt water stored in lakes. An additional CRCM5 transient climate change simulation with lakes and interflow, i.e. lateral flow in the soil layers, is compared with the simulation with lakes, but without interflow, to assess the impact of interflow on projected changes to regional climate and hydrology. Maximum interflow is projected to shift earlier in spring and the maximum interflow rate is expected to decrease by around 25 % in future. Results suggest that the impact of interflow on projected changes to precipitation, soil moisture and humidity are modest, even though the interflow intensity is changing noticeably in future climate. The impact of the interflow on projected changes to streamflows is in the range of +/- 50 m(3)/s. This study thus for the first time demonstrates the impact of lakes and interflow on projected changes to the regional climate and hydrology for the study region using a single regional modelling system.

Hourly, daily, and seasonal variability in the absorption spectra of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in a eutrophic, humic lake	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The short-term (hourly and daily) variation in chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in lakes is largely unknown. We assessed the spectral characteristics of light absorption by CDOM in a eutrophic, humic shallow mixed lake of temperate Sweden at a high-frequency (30min) interval and during a full growing season (May to October). Physical time series, such as solar radiation, temperature, wind, and partial pressures of carbon dioxide in water and air, were measured synchronously. We identified a strong radiation-induced summer CDOM loss (25 to 50%) that developed over 4months, which was accompanied by strong changes in CDOM absorption spectral shape. The magnitude of the CDOM loss exceeded subhourly to daily variability by an order of magnitude. Applying Fourier analysis, we demonstrate that variation in CDOM remained largely unaffected by rapid shifts in weather, and no apparent response to in-lake dissolved organic carbon production was found. In autumn, CDOM occasionally showed variation at hourly to daily time scales, reaching a maximum daily coefficient of variation of 15%. We suggest that lake-internal effects on CDOM are quenched in humic lake waters by dominating effects associated with imported CDOM and solar exposure. Since humic lake waters belong to one of the most abundant lake types on Earth, our results have important implications for the understanding of global CDOM cycling.

Qixinghe Wetland is a nature reserve area in northeastern China. In this paper, diatom communities and environmental qualities were investigated at eight sites in Qixinghe Wetland. This study was to examine diatom species patterns in relation to environmental variables in wetlands, and to use diatoms as indicators to water quality in wetlands and wetland classification. Diatoms were sampled in summers and autumns in 2002 and 2004, during which 180 taxa were identified. Environmental variations in pH, temperature, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were measured. The seasonal composition and abundance of diatoms changed greatly during the study period. The relationship between diatoms and chemical water quality was estimated statistically. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) with forward selection and Monte Carlo permutation tests revealed that all water environmental variables changed during the study period (P < 0.05). Among all the parameters, variation in BOD among the sites was a very important determinant of species composition according to the CCA, and BOD decreased from 2002 to 2004. Our results suggest that the water quality had improved during the three-year period because of enhanced environmental protection with less human disturbance. We conclude that diatoms can be used to indicate water quality and habitat conditions in this wetland.

Here, we explored the 3-day diurnal succession of the PPE community in a highly eutrophic lake in early spring using a combination of flow cytometric sorting and high-throughput sequencing. Our results showed that the PPEs were the dominant group of autotrophic picophytoplankton, although they had relatively low diversity and were dominated by the Stephanodiscaceae family in early spring in Lake Taihu. Furthermore, PPE abundance was significantly higher at night than during the day, probably due to their high specific rate of carbon uptake during the day and rapid proliferation at night. Several environmental variables had a significant influence on the PPE community composition, and the daily effect was more important than the diurnal effect when shaping the PPE community in Lake Taihu at a temporal scale of 3 days. Furthermore, based on the variation partitioning analysis (VPA), the relative importance of abiotic factors (deterministic processes) to short-term succession was low, explaining only 20.44% of the PPE community variation. We therefore conclude that stochastic processes determined PPE community assembly over a short temporal scale based on a neutral community model (NCM).

The lake is planned to provide drinking and potable water in Antalya in the near future. Therefore, water quality index value in the lake can be used to inform the public about water quality of the lake. In this study, interpolation maps for the surface of Karacaoren-II Dam Lake is constituted using water quality index values calculated by NSF indexing method. Thus, the areas which represents poor water quality are quickly determined by the help of water quality index values and point out the locations to take action. Furthermore, distribution of water quality indexes on the surface of the lake are assessed temporally by the help of interpolation maps. The results obtained from this study showed that distribution of water quality index values in winter are considerably different than that in summer. Water quality index values for winter represented middle class water quality in most of the reservoir. Thus, immediate measures should be taken to improve the water quality in the reservoir to achieve good water quality mentioned in Water Framework Directive.

It benefits a large population and its water quality has attracted much attention. In this study, seasonal investigations on 11 sampling sites along the MRP were conducted from 2018 to 2019; water temperature, pH, turbidity, transparency, CODMn, dissolved oxygen, total phosphorus, phosphate, total nitrogen, ammonia, nitrate, and chlorophyll a were determined synchronously. Single leakage distance clustering analysis identified the spatio-seasonal heterogeneity of physiochemical parameters. The trophic level index (TLI) and the water quality status were assessed: TLI increased and WQI decreased from south to north; TLI and WQI had seasonal differences (p < 0.001), the best water quality was observed in autumn, and the lowest TLI was observed in winter. The trophic level was "oligotrophic to mesotrophic"; water quality status was "good." The multiple linear stepwise regression analysis confirmed that total nitrogen (TN), Chl a, and CODMn were the driving factors in water quality.

Santiago			Hydrochemical dynamics of the "lake-spring" system in the crater of El Chichon volcano (Chiapas, Mexico)	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												El Chichon volcano (Chiapas, Mexico) erupted violently in March-April 1982, breaching through the former volcano-hydrothermal system. Since then, the 1982 crater has hosted a shallow (1-3.3 m, acidic (pH similar to 2.2) and warm (similar to 30 degrees C) crater lake with a strongly varying chemistry (CI/SO4=0-79 molar ratio). The changes in crater lake chemistry and volume are not systematically related to the seasonal variation of rainfall, but rather to the activity of near-neutral geyser-like springs in the crater (Soap Pool). These Soap Pool springs are the only sources of CI for the lake. Their geyser-like behaviour with a long-term (months to years) periodicity is due to a specific geometry of the shallow boiling aquifer beneath the lake, which is the remnant of the 1983 Cl-rich (24,000 mg/l) crater lake water. The Soap Pool springs decreased in CI content over time. The zero-time extrapolation (1982, year of the eruption) approaches the Cl content in the initial crater lake, meanwhile the extrapolation towards the future indicates a zero-Cl content by 2009 +/- 1. This particular situation offers the opportunity to calculate mass balance and Cl budget to quantify the lake-spring system in the El Chichon crater. These calculations show that the water balance without the input of SP springs is negative, implying that the lake should disappear during the dry season. The isotopic composition of lake waters (811) and 8180) coincide with this crater lake-SP dynamics, reflecting evaporation processes and mixing with SP geyser and meteoric water. Future dome growth, not observed yet in the post-1982 El Chichon crater, may be anticipated by changes in lake chemistry and dynamics. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This is despite the occurrence of mound springs in the southwest portion of the GAB in South Australia being previously linked with the occurrence of faulting and the many studies concerning the role that tectonics plays in the formation and ongoing maintenance of spring activity. This study examines the correlation between seismicity and spring occurrences within the southwestern GAB, as well as field evidence for the relationship between ongoing spring activity and intra-plate seismicity. It was found that spring formation within the southwestern GAB is correlated with an interpreted northwest-southeast, left-lateral transpressional shear zone that is related to the Adelaide Fold Belt underlying the GAB. The influence of seismicity at these sites is implied through the propagation of deformation structures and lineaments concordant with interpreted underlying regional structures. In zones of reactivation, these structures and lineaments develop networks that readily form conduits for the migration of groundwater. Consequently, the spring-carbonate-depositing springs of the southwestern GAB have potential as a record for intra-plate tectonic activity associated with the northern portion of the underlying Adelaide Fold Belt. The work presented here re-enforces the importance of considering the effect that faulting has on groundwater flow paths and interconnectivity with either overlying or underlying aquifers within the southwestern GAB.

DOC concentration was low (mean 37 +/- 19 mu MC) in the upstream waters, whereas, in general, it increased toward the downstream areas (mean 92 +/- 47 mu M C). Significant variations in DOC concentration were detected among rivers and channels. DOC concentration in the epilimnion of Lake Biwa increased during the summer period and decreased during the winter period. The lake hypolimnion has lower DOC concentration (mean 87 +/- 7 mu M C) compared with the epilimnion (107 +/- 15 pM C). Fulvic acid (FA)-like substances in the DOM were directly characterized by 3-D EEM. The fluorescence peak for upstream DOM was found in regions with longer wavelengths (excitation/emission 386 +/- 6/476 +/- 5 nm) compared with downstream and lake DOM (351 +/- 12/446 +/- 15 nm and 341 +/- 6/434 6 nm, respectively). The DOC concentration is correlated with fluorescence peak intensity of FA-like substances in DOM in river waters. Such a relationship was not found in lake DOM. A blueshift of the fluorescence peak from upstream to lake DOM was observed. A decrease in fluorescence intensities was also detected during the summer period. These results may suggest that the degradation of FA-like substances in DOM occurs from natural solar irradiation. Protein-like fluorescence was significantly detected in the take epilimnion during the summer period. A linear relationship between DOC concentration and protein-like fluorescence indicated that an autochthonous input of DOM gave rise to the increase in DOC concentration in the lake epilimnion during the summer. These results may suggest that the 3-D EEM can be used as a tool for the investigation of DOM dynamics at the watershed level with concurrent measurement of DOC concentration and the fluorescence properties of fulvic acid-like and protein-like substances.					; Yoshioka, Takahito/AAF-1250-2020	Mostofa, Khan M.G./0000-0001-5203-2432; Hayakawa, Kazuhide/0000-0001-9434-9729													1439-8621	1439-863X				AUG	2005	6	2					101	115		10.1007/s10201-005-0149-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-005-0149-6													WOS:000231200000005

Being the most edible by the populace, Labeo rohita was chosen for this purpose. Labeo rohita was collected from five different spots in the river close to the industrial outlets, covering three seasons: monsoon, winter, and summer throughout the year. Experiments unearthed that the deposition of heavy metals inside fishes always surpassed the standard margin, implying a pernicious aquatic milieu. The empirical data suggests that the mean concentrations of Cu, Pb, Cr, and Cd were higher than the permissible limits of WHO and FAO after feeding heavy metal-contaminated fishes for a period of 120 days. Seasonal variations were also taken into account, and it was noticed that rats fed with fish collected in winter had the highest heavy metal concentrations (P < 0.05). Significant architectural changes were observed during histopathological screening of rats' livers and kidneys characterized by necrosis, inflammation, and congestion. After gauging the obtained data, it might be concluded that consumption of heavy metal-contaminated fish entails accumulation of heavy metals, which causes histopathological changes in rats' livers and kidneys, including necrosis and severe structural deformational changes compared to those of control groups.					; Hakim, Mahmuda/AAU-9266-2021	Hakim, Mahmuda/0000-0003-0308-5348; Huque, Amdadul/0000-0002-3895-9378; Islam, Dr. Dipa/0000-0003-3769-6999; Roy, Dipankar Chandra/0000-0003-0299-5710; 													0163-4984	1559-0720				AUG	2023	201	8					3928	3940		10.1007/s12011-022-03477-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-022-03477-z		NOV 2022						36369452					WOS:000881906200001
J	Wu, J; Shen, CM; Yang, H; Qian, S; Xie, SC				Wu, Jie; Shen, Caiming; Yang, Huan; Qian, Shi; Xie, Shucheng			Holocene temperature variability in China	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The patterns and mechanisms of Holocene temperature variability in China remain highly controversial, possibly due to the lack of sufficient high-resolution records and few systematic compilations and re-views of published records. Here, we used branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) to generate a Holocene mean annual air temperature (MAAT) record from Lake Yangzonghai (YZH) in southwest (SW) China. Our record, largely ruling out the effect of seasonal bias, displays a long-term cooling of similar to 1.5 degrees C since 10 cal ka BP, indicating that the discrepancy of Holocene temperature records (such as long-term cooling vs warming trends) in China cannot be attributed to the seasonal bias in temperature proxies. We compiled 67 published Holocene temperature records from China. These temperature records exhibit a mathematically consistent pattern with a relatively warmer mid-Holocene and colder late Holocene in the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) domain, whilst records show a relatively colder mid-Holocene and warmer late Holocene in the westerlies domain. This spatial heterogeneity of Holocene temperature variability is attributed to the modulation of monsoon systems, including the warming effect of ASM and the cooling effect of the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM). In the ASM domain, the dominant pattern with the relatively warmer mid-Holocene and colder late Holocene is primarily controlled by the persistent weakening of the warming effect of the ASM and the concurrent strengthening of the cooling effect of the EAWM during the mid-to-late Holocene. In the westerlies domain, the warming effect of the ASM disappears, the cooling effect of the EAWM is confined to the north of the Tibetan Plateau due to the blocking effect of the Tibetan Plateau. This dominant pattern with the relatively colder mid-Holocene and warmer late Holocene is driven by the increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHG) radiative forcing and Northern Hemisphere Annual Insolation (NHAI) forcing during the mid-to-late Holocene.

Compounds which were detected most often included alpha-HCH and beta-HCH, and the volume-weighted mean (VWM) concentration of hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) was 33.0 ng L-1, accounting for 72.3% of the Sigma OCPs in precipitation. The total concentrations of OCPs ranged from 3.73 to 152 ng L-1 (mean: 29.7 +/- 3.5 ng L-1) for dissolved phase and from 1.61 to 114 ng L-1 (mean: 15.9 +/- 2.0 ng L-1) for particulate phase, respectively. OCPs in dissolved phase dominated sampled concentrations in precipitation (HCHs: 71.8%, Chlordane: 77.7%, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes-DDTs: 50.1%) with an exception of hexachlorobenzene-HCB (26.3%). Furthermore, the distribution coefficient, K-pd, was generally large in low temperature, especially in spring. The abundance of Sigma OCPs in the precipitation fluctuated monthly, with high value in late winter and spring. The past farmland near the sampling site was under construction during sampling, which may be an important local re-emission source in this study. The elevated wet deposition flux of 11 selected OCPs was 14.9 mu g m(-2) yr(-1) in Beijing. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Groundwater from 11 karst springs were measured for their isotopic content (C-14, H-3, C-13), chemical composition (HCO3, Ca2+, Mg2+) and physico-chemical properties (temperature, pH). Seasonal variations of the C-14 activity of DIC in two karst springs in Plitvice Lakes area, Yugoslavia, were measured systematically from 1979-1987. C-14 activity of recent tufa samples from several locations downstream were also measured. The activity of DIC in karst spring water in both countries ranged from 63-87 pMC, which is attributed to differences in geologic structure of the recharge area, topsoil thickness and composition. Grouping of C-14 activities of DIC ca (82+/-4)% is evident. Tritium activity at all the springs indicated short mean residence time (1-10 yr). Concentration of HCO3, Ca2+ and Mg2+ in spring water varied with geomorphology. C-14 activity of streamwater and recent tufa increased downstream from karst springs due to the exchange between atmospheric CO2 and DIC.																			0033-8222	1945-5755					1989	31	3					884	892																WOS:A1989EW80500079

Decreases in snow and ice cover extent and duration and extended periods of summer stratification have been observed in temperate lake systems throughout the Anthropocene. However, the effects of changing snow and ice cover on lacustrine communities remain largely uninvestigated. We examined underwater light climate and associated primary productivity patterns under snow-covered and clear-lake ice in 6 inland lakes in Minnesota, USA, spanning gradients of water column optical properties (blue, green, brown) associated with trophic status and organic material content. In all lakes, snow cover influenced not only the intensity, but also the spectral signature of light penetrating into the water column. Specifically, the wavelength of maximum penetration was shifted towards longer wavelengths under snow cover in green (eutrophic) lakes but was shifted towards shorter wavelengths in blue and brown lakes. Volumetric primary productivity was often higher than anticipated (e.g., similar to 1200 mg m(-3) d(-1); Lake Minnetonka, snow-covered ice). Carbon assimilation rates were lower under snow-covered ice throughout the water column in all lake types except immediately under cleared ice in eutrophic lakes, where phytoplankton were likely photoinhibited because of the penetration of intense, short-wavelength light. These findings suggest that changes to snow and ice cover under ongoing climate change scenarios can affect patterns of phytoplankton primary productivity in sensitive aquatic ecosystems.					; Silsbe, Greg/AAB-3321-2022	Silsbe, Greg/0000-0003-2673-1162; Crawford, Christopher/0000-0002-7145-0709; Shchapov, Kirill/0000-0001-6823-0927													2044-2041	2044-205X				JAN 2	2023	13	1					1	12		10.1080/20442041.2022.2102870	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2022.2102870		NOV 2022											WOS:000884718300001

But along with this development, there are unintended and undesirable consequences for human life and the environment that need, found a solution and corrected. One of the most important adverse consequences of agricultural development is the pollution of surface and groundwater resources, which results from various factors such as soil erosion and improper use of different pesticides. This study aimed to conduct an environmental monitoring program in Naseri wetland to determine the concentrations of organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) in water samples and also to evaluate the potential risks (ecological and health risk assessment) of these pesticides. The salting-out assisted liquid-liquid extraction method was used to extract pesticides. The residual concentrations of OPPs evaluated by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). In this study, the ecological risk of OPPs calculated for wetland ecosystem, based on the acute risk quotient (RQi) formula with maximum (RQmax), mean (RQmean), and mixture (RQmix) concentrations of organophosphorus pesticides in the wetland water. Also, to assess the health risk of consuming contaminated fish with organophosphate pesticides, the potential non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks were determined by the hazard quotient (Index) (HQ, HI) and incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) indices, respectively. The mean +/- SD concentration of OPPs (Chlorpyrifos, Malathion, Ethion, Dichlorvos, Trifluralin and Diazinon) in samples of wetland water ranged from 0.14 +/- 0.08 to 0.35 +/- 0.12 and 0.054 +/- 0.06 to 0.2 +/- 0.1 (mu g/L) in summer and autumn, respectively. The mean +/- SD of OPPs in fish varied from 0.68 +/- 0.86 to 3.94 +/- 2.7 (mu g/kg). Overall, the concentrations of pesticides in all water and fish samples were below the maximum residue limit (30 mu g/kg) during the study period, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the World Health Organization (WHO). The results of acute risk quotient were in summer (RQmax = 3.49E-4 to 0.067, RQmean = 5.8E-5 to 0.029, RQmix = 0.139-0.026, 0.018-3.42E-3) and autumn (RQmax = 8E-4 to 0.051, RQmean = 7.74E-6 to 0.018 RQmix = 0.1-0.013, 6E-3- 1.5E-3). The non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk indexes due to fish consumption for adults and children were (HQ = 0.026-4.68E-4, HI = 0.041, ILCR = 1.7E-7) and (HQ = 1.85E-3-1.3E-5, HI = 0.041, ILCR = 5.55E-8), respectively. The risk of OPPs was generally low. But cumulative risk (pesticide mixtures), should not be ignored.					jorfi, sahand/L-8906-2017; jaafarzadeh, neamat/JPY-2844-2023; Malehi, Amal/R-8625-2017	Jaafarzadeh, Nematallah/0000-0003-1172-4277; 													0025-326X	1879-3363				JUN	2022	179								113643	10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.113643	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.113643		MAY 2022						35526375					WOS:000800453500002

Blinded by the light: does heat or light enhance wild mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) attraction to CO2-baited traps in the Great Salt Lake area?	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY												The New Jersey Light Trap has been among the earliest trap models used for mosquito surveillance in the United States. This trap was modernized in the 1950s to the miniature CDC light trap, with the addition of CO2 following soon after. The incandescent light has the tendency to attract nontarget insects, as well as losing a substantial portion of their energy as heat. Few studies have delineated whether heat or light in isolation make a difference in field collections using the former traps within the United States. Our study focused on isolating heat and light variables by using incandescent bulbs, light emitting diode (LED) bulbs, and electric heating patches affixed to a base model CO2 trap as designed at the Salt Lake City Mosquito Abatement District. Sites were selected in the urban and suburban foothills and canyons of the Wasatch Mountain front, industrial areas near the Salt Lake City International Airport, and rural wetlands in the marshes outlying the Great Salt Lake. Five traps were replicated within each sector during the summer and fall summer seasons. Collections were composed of Aedes dorsalis (Meigen), Culex pipiens L., Culex tarsalis Coquillett, and Culiseta inornata (Williston). Composition changes were a result of seasonal, rather than spatial, shifts. The results showed that LED light traps depressed collections of key species. Otherwise, there were negligible differences in collections among incandescent, heat film, and base model traps. In the Intermountain West, the miniature CDC trap is reliable enough to make programmatic decisions even if light usage varies by district.

Quantitative and qualitative temporal variation of settled particles was shown even though seasonal variation was generally masked by bottom sediment resuspension in these shallow aquatic systems. Sedimentation rates fluctuated on a seasonal basis, They were minimum in spring and maximum in summer. These fluctuations were linked to the high primary production observed. These new traps showed that decaying submersed macrophytes can be an important source of organic matter, as well as decay of blue-green algal blooms which have always been considered responsible for anoxic problems in fish ponds. Interference by the fish farmer at various times of the year also caused sudden high sedimentation rates (>200g m(-2) d(-1)). Sedimentation in the fish ponds was controlled by natural mechanisms partly similar to those that occur in lakes, and by mechanisms specific to shallow systems and to aquatic systems managed by man.

It is shown that the forecasts can explain more than 50% of the short rains (boreal autumn) variance across large regions of Ethiopia, Somalia, and Kenya, and reaffirm the importance of the Walker-like circulation over the Indian Ocean. The forecasts also explain more than 50% of the long rains (boreal spring) over Uganda, Lake Victoria, and western Kenya, and demonstrate the strong connection of the long rains to the SSTs in the southern Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, southwestern Indian Ocean, and Arabian Sea. For the unimodal rains in Tanzania, the forecasts explain more than 40% of the rainfall variance over northwestern Tanzania based on SST predictors in the southwestern Indian Ocean and the subtropical North Atlantic. For the South Sudan and Ethiopian Kiremt rains, the forecast skill is less pronounced. The predictor regions (dipoles) for a recently developed method are validated through composite maps of surface and atmospheric reanalysis variables. Lastly, 2010-2011 forecasts for both the long and short rains demonstrate skill in predicting the recent drought suggesting that seasonal climate forecasts can inform natural disaster preparedness and water resources planning in East Africa.					; Chen, Chia-Jeng/W-6657-2019	Chen, Chia-Jeng/0000-0002-7018-1025; 													0899-8418	1097-0088				AUG	2015	35	10					2698	2723		10.1002/joc.4165	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.4165													WOS:000359632500002

Therefore, it is important to fully evaluate the ecological restoration effect of the water diversion project on the water-receiving area before implementing water replenishment. For this purpose, we developed an integrated model framework based on the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) and Random Forest (RF). We adopted a probability distribution method to address the uncertainty during model coupling. This framework was implemented to simulate and predict the evolution of phytoplankton diversity in Baiyangdian Lake (BL) in China. To solve the problem that the phytoplankton biodiversity in BL decreased especially in summer due to human activity, the Yellow River into BL, the south-to-north water diversion project, and joint replenishment of upstream reservoirs have been implemented in recent years. Our framework was used to analyze the biodiversity restoration effects of multi-source water replenishment through different routings. The results show that spatiotemporal coverage should be considered to reduce uncertainty during model coupling. Water replenishment has a positive impact on the biodiversity of BL; however, there are effective areas for phytoplankton diversity restoration, which are related to water quality and quantity, water replenishment routing and internal hydrological connectivity. The Xiaobai River has the most significant water ecological restoration potential among the routings, compared with that of the Baigou and Fu Rivers. Appropriate water replenishment in spring will play a vital role in alleviating the decrease in phytoplankton biodiversity in summer owing to flood control.

Marie, MI allow passage of deep draft vessels from Lake Superior to the lower Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River system. Although the locks are closed to winter-long navigation, operators face serious ice problems following the reopening of the locks in early spring. Broken lake ice pushed ahead of downbound ships can make it difficult or impossible for the vessels to enter the locks. Existing solutions such as locking the ice separately through the main lock or an adjacent smaller lock result in delays and increased costs to the navigation industry. A physical model study at the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory will examined a range of alternatives aimed at improving ice passage at the Soo Locks. This paper describes the ice problems at the Soo as well as the objectives of the physical model study.																					0-7844-0451-8				1999							623	630																WOS:000086435800056

The length frequency analysis identified two different age groups. The first recruits were recorded in July and were present thereafter until December. Females reached greater sizes, grew faster and lived longer than males. The largest sizes found were 43.06 mm for females and 34.34 mm for males. Sex-ratio deviated significantly from unity (1.65:1). Multiple spawning occurred throughout the reproductive cycle (from May to August). The average brood size per female reached its maximum in June (50.8 embryos per female). After reproduction, the percentage of parental individuals decreased drastically. Mosquitofish fed mainly on zooplankton (Copepoda, littoral Cladocerans), but surface insects (such as Nematoceran adults, basically Chironomid, collembolans, Hemiptera, spiders and worms) were additional food. Diet composition showed little seasonal variation. Trophic niche breadth was largest in summer (H=0.68), and smallest in autumn (H=0.46). The mean volume of stomach contents increased significantly for fish larger than 30 mm TL (Total Length). Gambusia holbrooki showed high intrapopulation dietary overlap and followed a specialist feeding strategy with adaptation to seasonal prey availability. Moreover, Culicidae larvae constituted a small quantitative fraction of the G. holbrooki diet which raised questions about the extensive use of mosquitofish for biological control of mosquitoes.					; OIKONOMOU, ANTHI/AFZ-1572-2022; Leonardos, Ioannis/KRP-9458-2024; Gkenas, Christos/B-4588-2012	Oikonomou, Anthi/0000-0003-2537-8846; Gkenas, Christos/0000-0002-9863-2289													1790-045X						2012	17						121	136																WOS:000303663000013

An abrupt ecosystem change in Lake Beloye, southern Western Siberia: Palaeoclimate versus local environment	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Sediment structure, rock-magnetic and bio-geochemical records obtained from sapropel core samples in Lake Beloye, southern Western Siberia, indicate an abrupt ecosystem change at 3.4 calibrated ka BP. The lake changed from eutrophic to oligotrophic, its vegetation - from carbon-fixing macrophytic angiosperms to calcium-fixing macrophytic algae and angiosperms, and, as a result, the type of sedimentation shifted from peaty sapropel to carbonate-rich sapropel. Those changes could be induced by climate, which was warmer and wetter before 3.4 ka BP and cooler and drier after this. Nevertheless, our data show that those ecosystem changes occurred when the lake became shallower to get about 1 m depth and started to freeze to the bottom in winter time. The full freezing of the lake led to the deposition of carbonates, which resulted in: i) death of carbon-utilizing macrophytic angiosperms; and ii) winter precipitation of calcium carbonate. In summer, additional portions of Ca2+ and HCO3- ions come into the lake from the surrounding CaCO3 rich loess sediments with ground water. The Beloye lake thus represents an example of interrelated regional climatic and local ecological factors, which combination resulted in the 3.4 cal. ka BP dramatic change of its ecosystem.

J	Benoît, J; Legault, M				Benoît, J; Legault, M			Assessment of the feasibility of preventing reproduction of lake charr, Salvelinus namaycush, in shallow areas of reservoirs affected by drawdowns	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES					4th International Charr Symposium	JUN 25-JUL 01, 2000	TROIS RIVIERES, CANADA					Lake charr, Salvelinus namaycush, spawn almost exclusively in lakes, in the fall. Spawning sites in inland lakes are generally located close to the shore in areas with coarse-textured substrate, and in depths of less than 2 m. Because of the type of water management system applied in reservoirs where water levels are lowered during the winter, eggs deposited during the fall around the shallow shoreline of reservoirs can be exposed. The depth of spawning sites relative to drawdowns may be a limiting factor for lake charr survival in reservoirs. In 1995 and 1996, we evaluated the ability to induce lake charr reproduction in deeper water, below the range of fluctuating water levels by the sequential construction of artificial reefs and limiting access to natural spawning habitat. The creation of artificial deeper water spawning areas, adjacent to natural sites, produced a partial transfer of reproduction. However when natural spawning sites were covered with tarpaulins almost all the eggs were laid in the artificial deeper water spawning areas. Complete or partial transfer of reproduction activities to sites below the depth not affected by water level fluctuations is therefore a potential way of alleviating the effects of hydroelectric reservoir management.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				JUN	2002	64	1-3					303	311		10.1023/A:1016098216959	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1016098216959													WOS:000177002400028

In summer, compared with the dredged area including neither zoobenthos nor submerged macrophytes, the algal biomass and density were significantly lower in the area filled with the submerged macrophytes. Interestingly, the minimum algal bloom was observed in the combined area containing submerged macrophytes and zoobenthos, which was due to the synergistic interaction between the zoobenthos and the macrophytes. The metabolite extracts from the numerically dominant zoobenthos Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri had significant algal inhibitory effects of Microcystis aeruginosa, and displayed stimulatory effects on seed germination, seedling growth, and peroxidase activity of the prevalent submerged macrophyte Potamogeton malaianus. 27 active compounds in the worm metabolites were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Among these compounds three chemicals arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and linoleic acid with concentrations of 13.92 +/- 1.11, 10.57 +/- 2.52, 2.75 +/- 0.73 mg/kg dry weight, respectively, were confirmed as the typical allelochemicals with algal inhibition potential. In short, the metabolites allelopathy of L. hoffineisteri can form and assist the synergistic effect between L. hoffineisteri and P. malaianus on algal suppression. Thus, it is feasible to simultaneously restore submerged macrophytes and zoobenthos community in the disturbed eutrophic lakes for removing harmful algae.

J	Yang, L; Liu, PA; Wang, RX				Yang, Lu; Liu, Ping-An; Wang, Rong-Xing			Waterbird diversity and spatial distribution across China: Patterns and conservation strategies	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Understanding regional patterns of waterbird distribution and community assembly is crucial for effective conservation in China. However, comprehensive nationwide analyses of waterbird spatial distribution remain limited. Elucidating these patterns and underlying mechanisms and developing corresponding conservation strategies is imperative. We compiled waterbird data from citizen science reports and publications (2000-2022) to investigate the spatial distribution and community assembly of the waterbirds across China, proposing region- and season-specific conservation recommendations. Our analysis of 243 recorded waterbird species revealed a distinct north-south distribution pattern centered on approximately 35 degrees latitude. Southern regions predominantly hosted resident and wintering species, whereas northern regions were dominated by summer visitors and migrants. This pattern persisted for both total and threatened/ protected species. Community composition varied substantially across lake zones, likely influenced by temperature and migratory status. Resident and wintering communities displayed high compositional similarity across most lake zones, except in the Northeast Plain and Mountain Lake Zone, whereas breeding and migratory communities exhibited a more pronounced east-west differentiation. The assembly of waterbird communities is scale-dependent and varies with migratory status, with environmental filtering and neutral processes dominating at the gamma and beta scales, respectively. The findings of this study highlight the need for spatially and temporally tailored national conservation strategies that prioritize habitat protection and mitigation of climate change and human impacts. Locally, efforts should focus on enhancing habitat connectivity via ecological corridors to support waterbird dispersal.

Environmental impact on profiles of aroma compounds in pangasius and tilapia farmed in an inland and a coastal region of Bangladesh	FISHERIES SCIENCE												Taste and flavor compounds are important parameters when consumers decide on preferences for fish products. In this study, the content and composition of volatile compounds were examined in the winter and summer seasons in tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and pangasius (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) farmed in two regions in Bangladesh: freshwater ponds in the inland Bogura region and brackish water ponds in the coastal Khulna region. In the flesh of the two fish species, 13 terpenes, 10 benzenes, and 12 hydrocarbons were detected. Seasonal and location-specific variations were observed for terpenes and hydrocarbons, while benzenes were less variable. The specific sources of the volatiles were not identified, but anthropogenic pollution, agricultural run-off, and phytoplankton might have contributed volatiles to the fish. It is hypothesized that the lower abundance of volatiles at the coastal Khulna region, as compared with the inland Bogura region, was caused by the tidal inflow of clean seawater at Khulna.

The winter CH4 production was estimated to result in a loss of 3.6-7.9 g CH4 m(-2) from the lake to the atmosphere during the short period of ice melt. This could account for 22-48% of the annual CH4 emission from the pelagic zone of the lake. The contribution of winter to the annual CH4 release can be similar or even higher in seasonally ice-covered northern aquatic ecosystems than in northern terrestrial wetlands, thus winter must be considered in any studies into the aquatic CH4 emissions. The trophic state and wintertime oxygen conditions, linked to the changes in land-use in the catchments and climate, are important factors controlling the springtime lake CH4 emissions.

Finally, the impacts of the natural environment, history, and cultural factors on the evaluation of the Jingci Temple soundscape were studied. It was found that natural sounds, cultural sounds, and historic sounds were widely acclaimed in people's subjective feelings, which indicated the close relationships among historical and cultural background, soundscape, and natural environment.

In this study, we used a data set of phytoplankton dynamics in eutrophic Lake Taihu that cover more than two decades (1993-2015) to show the variation in and the drivers of phytoplankton biomass under complex, fluctuating environmental conditions. Our results showed that the phytoplankton biomass increased slowly over the studied period despite the recent decrease in nutrient levels. The distribution of the phytoplankton biomass expanded spatially towards the central lake region, and seasonally towards the autumn and winter. Nutrients were still the primary predictors of the long-termphytoplankton biomass trend. The effect size of climate-related variables was also high and close to the effect size of nutrients. Among the climate-related variables, wind speed and underwater available light were more important predictors than temperature. The biomass of the phytoplankton taxonomic groups showed different responses to the environmental variables based on their niches. However, the compensatory dynamics affecting biomass were weak at phylum level, and synchronous dynamics drove the variation in total biomass. Our findings highlight the effect of climate-related variables on the phytoplankton biomass in Lake Taihu, which has experienced high nutrient loadings and concentrations for more than two decades. Therefore, changes in climate-related variables, such as wind speed and underwater available light, should be considered when evaluating the amount that nutrients should be reduced in Lake Taihu for future lake management.

At the beginning of each year the diet of both percids, when shorter than 100 mm, is dominated by large, benthic Hydropsyche. Later in the year, epiphytic Chironomidae and Simuliidae replace these trichopterans in the perch diet, and benthic Chironomidae replace them in the ruffe diet. Large cladoceran species then become accessory food items for perch. Consequently, the food niche overlap of these two percids during the research period is only marginal.

J	Ricker, WE				Ricker, WE			A critical discussion of various measures of oxygen saturation in lakes	ECOLOGY												Of the 4 or 5 solubility tables which have been used in calculating standards of O saturation, that calculated by Whipple and Whipple (Jour. Amer. Chem. Soc. 33: 362-365. 1911) from the data of Fox seems most worthy of universal adoption. The best known standard of saturation is the solubility of O from the air at the temp. of the water sample under consideration; in using it, the solubility should be adjusted to the normal pressure at the elevation of the lake in question. Alsterberg uses the above standard only at the time of a lake''s vernal and autumnal circulation, and in the epilimnion in summer; in the summer sub-epilimnion the solubility at 4[degree] C. may be used as a standard, and in winter under ice the solubility at 0[degree] C. In Maucha''s standard of saturation there is an attempt to include recognition of the effect of the hydrostatic pressure of the lake''s water. The present author''s absolute standard of saturation involves total pressure (including hydrostatic) and the quantities of gases other than O dissolved in the sample being considered. Rutt-ner''s application of Van''t Hoff''s law makes it possible to compare, roughly at least, the respiratory value of different concentrations of O at different temps.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1934	15						348	363		10.2307/1932350	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1932350													WOS:000200148400046
J	Li, Y; Wang, S; Zhang, WW; Yuan, JH; Xu, C				Li, Yong; Wang, Shuang; Zhang, Weiwei; Yuan, Jiahui; Xu, Chun			Potential Drivers of the Level and Distribution of Nitrogen in the Hyporheic Zone of Lake Taihu, China	WATER												The hyporheic zone is the connection between surface water and groundwater that often plays an important function in nutrient transport and transformation, and acts as an active source of or sink for nutrients to the surface water, depending on its potential water flow patterns. Bottom surface water and sediments in the shallow hyporheic zone (approximately 100 cm depth) were sampled at 12 sites near the shoreline and two sites at the center of Lake Taihu (China) during spring and winter of 2016. Concentrations of total nitrogen, ammonium, nitrate, and nitrite in the bottom surface water and porewater (obtained from sediments using a frozen centrifugation method) were analyzed in a laboratory to establish the nitrogen distribution and potential drivers. The results show that, in general, the quality of bottom water and porewater near the shoreline was poor compared to that at the center, and it gradually improved from the northwestern to the southeastern zones of Lake Taihu. No significant relationship in nitrogen concentration was found between the bottom water and porewater in surface sediments. Nitrogen concentrations in porewater differed between sampling sites and sediment depths in Lake Taihu. Vertical profiles of nitrogen in porewater and differences in nitrogen between the winter and spring seasons indicated that potential upwelling water flow occurred in the hyporheic zone in the south, west, north, and center zones of Lake Taihu, but potentially weak water flow in variable directions likely occurred in the east zone. A strong reducing environment dominated the deep parts of the hyporheic zone (i.e., below 40 cm depth), while a weak oxidizing environment dominated the shallow parts. Furthermore, the decreasing total nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen from the deep to shallow depths in the hyporheic zones in the south, west, north, and center zones indicated that potential anammox and/or denitrification processes occurred. In the east zone, potential weak nitrification processes occurred in the hyporheic zone, and plant fixation and sedimentation of nitrogen also contributed to the surface sediments. In conclusion, the hyporheic zone near the shoreline in the south, west, and north sites of Lake Taihu acts as an active source of nitrogen for the lake water due to potential upwelling water flows, whereas the east site acts as an active source or sink due to seasonally variable directions in water flow. Water flow and biogeochemistry in the hyporheic zone jointly influence nutrient distribution in the hyporheic zone and even switch or alternate the source/sink function of sediment in surface water.					xu, Chunyang/HTO-1571-2023; Li, Yong/U-9139-2017; Yuan, jiahui/LJL-3115-2024	Li, Yong/0000-0002-2526-0250; 														2073-4441				JUL	2017	9	7							544	10.3390/w9070544	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w9070544													WOS:000406681700095

Moreover, the effect on water quality was also discussed. Results showed that: (1) The DON concentration of the water-land interface from Erhai Lake via Yongan River was between 0. 25 and 1. 39 mg . L-1 and the DON concentration were relatively high by summer and autumn from the inflow river input into the Erhai Lake. The loading of DON into the Erhai Lake by Yongan River between 0. 48 and 2. 34 t, and it was relatively high in summer, suggesting that the potential risk for impact on the water quality of Erhai Lake was relatively large by the inflow river into the Erhai Lake, especially in the summer. (2) The DON mainly comprised humic-like substances in the water-land interface from the Yongan river flow into the Erhai Lake, showing the decrease by the microbial degradation with 15. 27%, however, aromatic proteins-like and dissolved metabolites of the microorganisms were accumulated by 42. 00% and 20. 68% respectively to some extent. In addition, the humification degree of DON was gradually decreased by 14. 97% via Yongan River into Erhai Lake. Moreover, the substitution groups in the aromatic rings of DON showed that the transformation of mainly contained aliphatic chains to carbonyl, carboxyl, hydroxyl and esters from inflow river into Erhai Lake, particularly in the summer; (3) The composition characteristic parameters of DON (P-(III+v,P-n /P-(I+II,P- n), A(253) /A(203)) was positively correlated with the contents of the different nitrogen (N) forms (R-2=0. 64 similar to 0. 74, P<0. 1, p<0. 05) in the water-land interface from Erhai Lake via Yongan river, that was, the structure affect their bioavailability; the different structural characteristic parameters of DON in the water -land interface from Erhai Lake had a significant positive correlation with water quality(R=0. 82 similar to 0. 96, p< 0. 05, p<0.01), indicating that the composition, structure and bioavailability of DON had contributed to the water pollution in the water -land interface from the Yongan river input into the Erhai lake, especially being greatly affected by the terrestrial pollution such as human activity in summer. Therefore, the change of composition and structure of DON ( such as Pca+v,, P(I+ II ) A(253) /A(203)) in the water -land interface from the Yongan river into lake could reflect the condition of the water quality of Erhai Lake to some extent.

Artificial substrates (smoothed small discs mounted on a Plexiglas sheet) were placed at a depth of 8 in in April 2003, July 2003, January 2004 and February 2004. The discs were collected after 6-7 weeks for counting and taxonomic identification of the diatoms. The community structure of epilithic diatoms showed a dominance of motile species over the entire study period, followed by erect, adnate and tube-dwelling diatoms. Diatom density showed a marked seasonal variability, ranging from 365 407 (winter 2004) to 557156 +/- 82602 celiscm- 2 (spring 2004). Biomass ranged from 0.02 +/- 0.01 to 17.53 +/- 3.20 mu g C cm(-2). Abundance and biomass values did not present any significant differences for the three substrates examined.

Kinetic analyses according to a mixed-substrate kinetic model always revealed linear kinetics. The method was found useful in unveiling in situ specific algal-bacterial associations mediated through the release of EOC from the primary procedures. Further, bacterial adaptation toward the phycosphere of Microcystis aeruginosa could be deteted by following the shift in X-intercepts for the lines of net uptake and respiration during the development of a bloom of M. aeruginosa. By simultaneous measurements of particulate primary production, EOC release and transport of EOC to the bacteria by a differential filtration technique, it is shown that the method presented does not generally estimate changes in the kinetic parameters, but does reveal qualitative changes. It is concluded that the mixed-substrate method is a powerful approach for elucidating specific algal-bacterial associations in situ, even in highly complex eutrophic environments.																			0030-1299	1600-0706					1985	45	3					311	322		10.2307/3565566	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3565566													WOS:A1985AVY5900003
J	JENSEN, P				JENSEN, P			ECOLOGY OF BENTHIC AND EPIPHYTIC NEMATODES IN BRACKISH WATERS	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Abundances of benthic nematodes from shallow waters in Tvarminne, Finland and in Ringkobing Fjord, Denmark averaged 1.2-1.5 106 individuals m-2. Less than 20 spp. were found. More than 80% of the individuals were made up by Anoplostoma viviparum, Chromadorita fennica, Axonolaimus spinosus, Daptonema trabeculosum and Sabatieria pulchra, S. pulchra is designated as an anoxybiotic species and is attracted to the root tips of young Potamogeton perfoliatus; A. viviparum and C. fennica are oxybiotic species. Abundance of epiphytic nematodes extracted from submerged macrophytes in the Cladophora-Pilayella belt in the outer archipelago of the Finnish archipelago (July 1978) was estimated to reach 5 .cntdot. 106 individuals m-2, equivalent to a biomass of 1.2 g org. [organic] C m-2. Abundance and biomass are smaller in the Potamogeton meadows in the inner archipelago, in littoral algal vegetation of the sea zone, and on sublittoral vegetation. Epiphytic nematode species composition is influenced by salinity and food availability and not by physiognomic types or silt contents of the vegetation in the Baltic Sea, European estuaries and lakes. Dominant species are: Chromadorina bioculata, Punctodora ratzeburgensis, Chromadorita tenuis, Adoncholaimus thalassophygas, Theristus acer, Monhystera parva, M. aff. filiformis and Chromadora aff. nudicapitata. A theory is proposed to explain observed seasonal changes in the species composition of epiphytic and benthic nematodes. During winter months, the submerged vegetation is mostly destroyed, being found as detritus on the sea bottom. Sampling benthic nematodes during winter thus includes epiphytic species living in the detritus. In spring the epiphytic nematodes detect the newly growing vegetation, leave the sea bottom, colonize the submerged vegetation and spend their life there.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1984	108	3					201	217		10.1007/BF00006329	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006329													WOS:A1984SB40200001
J	Zhang, XY; Liu, M				Zhang, Xiaoyan; Liu, Meixian			Assessing the Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Seasonal Precipitation Extremes and the Potential Influencing Factors in Dongting Lake Basin, China	WATER												The Dongting Lake Basin (DTLB) of China is a flood prone area. Knowledge of the spatiotemporal characteristics and risks of precipitation extremes is essential for flood mitigation. Based on the precipitation amount (R), precipitation intensity (Ri), max 1 day precipitation amount (Rx1) and max 5 day precipitation amount (Rx5), this study analyzed the spatial-temporal patterns, risks and investigated the influences of the precipitation extremes at seasonal scale. The distributed high values of R, Ri, Rx1, Rx5 and their 5-year return levels (R-5, Ri(5), Rx1(5), Rx5(5)) indicated high flood risks in the eastern and northern parts of the basin, and the general upward trends of these indices suggested increasing flood risks, except for some areas in southwestern part in spring and autumn. The precipitation extremes were related to the topographic and circulation factors, within which the latter might have greater roles. Furthermore, the trend directions of the 5-year return levels (R-5, Ri(5), Rx1(5), Rx5(5)) were not always the same as the initial indices (R, Ri, Rx1, Rx5), suggesting that overall decreasing (increasing) precipitation extremes do not always represent decreasing (increasing) risks of floods. Hence, policy makers should pay more attention to the risks of precipitation extremes rather than their overall tendencies.

Triacyl-glycerol (TG) was the predominant storage lipid; its level remained high (33-40% of dry wt) from June through January. During the period of reproduction from February through May, TG dropped steeply to a low of 9%. The abrupt increase in TG concentration from May to June was probably caused by the recruitment of non-reproducing adult females. Throughout summer and fall ovaries remained unripe. Feeding experiments at satiating food concentrations at 6-degrees and 20-degrees-C suggest that low temperature and the hypolimnion was a major reason that ovaries did not ripen. Stored TG served as a potential buffer to starvation, although starvation conditions did not occur. By remaining in the hypolimnion rather than in the epilimnion, D. sicilis is assured a relatively stable supply of algae, low metabolic rate, and escape from predation. These advantages may have to be weighed against a reproductive bottleneck of low temperature.

This study investigated the temporal and spatial distribution of 31 target compounds across surface water, DWSs, and tap water. PPCPs and EDCs were ubiquitously detected, with significant spatial and seasonal variations. Downstream urban sites in Hangzhou exhibited the highest concentrations, driven by dense population and domestic sewage discharge. Total contaminant levels in summer surface water were 2.6 times that in winter, attributable to reduced dry-season runoff. However, certain pharmaceuticals, including erythromycin (66 x higher) and carbamazepine (13 x higher), peaked in winter due to consistent usage patterns. River-type DWSs showed elevated contamination compared to lake/reservoir-type systems, likely from intensified hydraulic exchange with polluted surface water. Correspondingly, tap water sourced from rivertype DWSs contained higher PPCPs and EDCs levels. Post-COVID-19 medication practices and population-driven economic growth contributed to markedly higher PPCP concentrations than historical data. These findings highlight the vulnerability of riverine DWSs to emerging contaminants and underscore the need for seasonally adaptive pollution control strategies. The study provides a critical baseline for ecological risk assessment and targeted mitigation in rapidly urbanizing watersheds.																			2213-2929	2213-3437				AUG	2025	13	4							117222	10.1016/j.jece.2025.117222	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2025.117222													WOS:001502543200014

The case study of Microcystis aeruginosa on the reservoir of Grangent (Loire, France). New method of sampling adapted to colonial cyanobacteria was developed on the Grangent reservoir (Loire, France). These prokaryotes were sampled using a filtering pump and were counted at laboratory under epifluorescence microscope. This method allowed us to follow the annual cycle of Microcystis aeruginosa, since benthic spring recruitment (cyanobacteria being used as inoculum) until autumnal sedimentation, and even revealed the presence of this cyanobacterian species in winter in the epilimnion. Our study also showed the inadequacy of the standard sampling methods used in limnology, which badly underestimate colonial cyanobacteria. (C) 2004 Academie des sciences. Publie par Elsevier SAS.

The area was covered with alpine desert vegetation from ca. 15.2 to 14 kyr BP (I kyr = 1000 cal. years), reflecting dry and cold conditions. High influx values of long-distance transported Pinus sylvestris type pollen suggest prevailing air flow from the west and northwest. The spread of alpine meadow communities and local aquatic vegetation is a weak sign of climate amelioration after ca. 14 kyr BR Pollen data (e.g. influx values of Pinus roxburghii type and Quercus) suggest that this was due to a strengthening of the summer monsoon and the reduced activity of westerly winds. The further spread of Artemisia and species-rich meadows occurred in response to improved moisture conditions between ca. 12.9 and 12.5 kyr BP. The subsequent change towards drier desert-steppe vegetation likely indicates more frequent westerly disturbances and associated snowfalls, which favoured the persistence of alpine meadows on edaphically moist sites. The spread of Chenopodiaceae-dominated vegetation associated with an extremely weak monsoon occurred at ca. 12.2-11.8 kyr BP during the Younger Dryas interstadial. A major increase in humidity is inferred from the development of Artemisia-dominated steppe and wet alpine meadows with Gentianaceae after the late glacial/early Holocene transition in response to the strengthening of the summer monsoon. Monsoonal influence reached maximum activity in the Tso Kar region between ca. 10.9 and 9.2 kyr BR The subsequent development of the alpine meadow, steppe and desert-steppe vegetation points to a moderate reduction in the moisture supply, which can be linked to the weaker summer monsoon and the accompanying enhancement of the winter westerly flow from ca. 9.2 to 4.8 kyr BP. The highest water levels of Tso Kar around 8 kyr BP probably reflect combined effect of both monsoonal and westerly influence in the region. An abrupt shift towards aridity in the Tso Kar region occurred after ca. 4.8 kyr BP, as evidenced by an expansion of Chenopodiaceae-dominated desert-steppe. Low pollen influx values registered ca. 2.8-1.3 kyr BP suggest scarce vegetation cover and unfavourable growing conditions likely associated with a further weakening of the Indian Monsoon.

The Annual Cycle of Energy Input, Modal Excitation and Physical Plus Biogenic Turbulent Dissipation in a Temperate Lake	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												A year of measurements by Doppler Current Profilers, a chain of temperature sensors and a suite of meteorological instruments has been analyzed to elucidate the seasonal cycle of the dynamical response of a temperate lake (Windermere) to surface forcing. The efficiency of energy input to the lake (Eff) was determined by comparing the rate of working by the surface wind-stress RWy with the downward flux of momentum in the atmosphere. Eff was found to increase from values of similar to 0.3% in winter mixed conditions, up to similar to 1.2% during summer stratification, when internal seiches were present. Water column kinetic energy was similarly enhanced during stratification. Spectral analysis of the axial velocity showed that the first vertical mode was dominant during most of the stratified period with a less prominent second mode appearing in the early part of the summer. The observed periods and vertical structure of these modes generally accorded with estimates from internal wave theory based on density profiles. During stratification, pycnocline dissipation exhibited high variability linked to the surface forcing with an average, depth-integrated, pycnocline dissipation rate of 2.5 x 10(-5) W m(-2) corresponding to similar to 3%-4% of RWy. Over the same period, the dissipation rate in the bottom boundary layer (BBL) exhibited a marked diurnal variation unrelated to physical forcing. Acoustic backscatter indicated the presence of vertically migrating organisms with peak aggregation in the BBL around midday coinciding with maximum dissipation. During stratification, biogenic dissipation contributed an average of similar to 36% of the total BBL dissipation rate of similar to 5.7 x 10(-5) W m(-2).

In the last forty years, the development of phytoplankton was analyzed in five extreme winter seasons. The studies of phytoplankton characteristics in the water column took into account values of biomass, concentration of chlorophyll-a and species composition, including dominant species. Differences in the vertical distribution of flagellate and non-flagellate species belonging to cyanobacteria and algae were analyzed in the gradient of light and thermal conditions. The phytoplankton biomass was low and vertically differentiated, with the lowest values at the deeper part of the water column. Flagellate species from the group of Cryptophyceae, Chrysophyceae and Dinophyceae were most abundant. Species biodiversity was low but every winter the dominant species represented different taxonomic groups. In some periods, larger non-motile phytoplankton species from green or blue-green algae dominated. The research proved that the development of phytoplankton under the ice cover was limited mainly by light and, to a lesser extent, by temperature.

Role of winter severity on juvenile Bighead Carp and Silver Carp growth and survival across latitudes	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Population dynamics and ecological effects of invasive fishes are affected by offspring survival to sexual maturity (recruitment). Recruitment is oftentimes determined by conditions experienced during early life, and winter conditions become increasingly influential as species invade north in temperate regions. Bighead Carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and Silver Carp (H. molitrix) have invaded mid-latitudes of North America and threaten to invade farther north. We conducted pond experiments and bioenergetic simulations to: (1) assess the effects of mild winters on juvenile Bighead Carp and Silver Carp at mid-latitudes; (2) determine how conspecific density affects juveniles during mild winters; and, (3) determine effects of increased winter severity at increasing latitudes. Both species displayed high overwinter survival (85%) in pond experiments. Bighead Carp grew in length (mean 2mm) and maintained initial body mass and percent dry mass (index of energy content). Silver Carp maintained initial length and mass and remained in high condition (dry mass). Conspecific densities tested did not affect growth, condition, or survival. Simulations suggest juvenile Bighead Carp could energetically survive the longest, coldest winter simulated (48 degrees latitude); however, energy reserves at the start of winter became increasingly important for survival as latitude increased. Bighead Carp and Silver Carp recruitment success at mid-latitudes is likely driven by non-winter factors. If these species invade farther north, winter severity may play a stronger role in offspring survival, recruitment, and population dynamics. However, warmer and shorter winters at high latitudes caused by climate change will minimize this potential bottleneck and increase chances of successful recruitment.

Variability of Carbonate Isotope Signatures in a Hydrothermally Influenced System: Insights from the Pastos Grandes Caldera (Bolivia)	MINERALS												Laguna Pastos Grandes (Bolivia), nesting in a volcanic caldera, is a large, palustrine-to-lacustrine system fed by meteoric and hydrothermal calco-carbonic fluids. These different fluid inputs favor a complex mosaic of depositional environments, including hydrothermal springs, pools, and an ephemeral lake, producing abundant present-day carbonates developing over a Holocene carbonate crust dated by U-Th. Present-day carbonates (muds, concretions, and microbialites) recorded a large range of isotope variations, reaching 13.9 parts per thousand in delta C-13 and 11.1 parts per thousand in delta O-18. Sedimentological and geochemical data indicated that the main processes influencing the isotope record were: (i) rapid CO2 degassing and temperature decreases along hydrothermal discharges; (ii) strong evaporation favored by the arid high-altitude Andean climate, locally enhanced by capillary water rise within microbial mats or by wind-induced spray falling on vadose concretions. Unlike past or present perennial lake systems in Central Andes, the short residence time of brine waters in the ephemeral central lake prevents enrichment of lacustrine carbonates in C-13 and O-18. The very low fraction modern (FC)-C-14 in these present-day carbonates demonstrates that incorporation of fossil magmatic carbon related to the volcanic context also prevents any radiocarbon dating. The use of isotopes for the interpretation of ancient continental series should always be accompanied by a thorough characterization of the environmental setting.

On the contribution of lakes in predicting near-surface temperature in a global weather forecasting model	TELLUS SERIES A-DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The impact of lakes in numerical weather prediction is investigated in a set of global simulations performed with the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). A Fresh shallow-water Lake model (FLake) is introduced allowing the coupling of both resolved and subgrid lakes (those that occupy less than 50% of a grid-box) to the IFS atmospheric model. Global fields for the lake ancillary conditions (namely lake cover and lake depth), as well as initial conditions for the lake physical state, have been derived to initialise the forecast experiments. The procedure for initialising the lake variables is described and verified with particular emphasis on the importance of surface water temperature and freezing conditions. The response of short-range near surface temperature to the representation of lakes is examined in a set of forecast experiments covering one full year. It is shown that the impact of subgrid lakes is beneficial, reducing forecast error over the Northern territories of Canada and over Scandinavia particularly in spring and summer seasons. This is mainly attributed to the lake thermal effect, which delays the temperature response to seasonal radiation forcing.

A 850-year record climate and vegetation changes in East Siberia (Russia), inferred from geochemical and biological proxies of lake sediments	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												East Siberia is very sensitive to moisture regimes because it is located in a margin area, where moisture from the North Atlantic is strongly depleted, and the penetration of the East Asian monsoon is weak and rare. In winter months, the Siberian anticyclone strongly blocks and reduces the external influences on the region. The high latitude of the study area at 52A degrees N is probably sensitive to variation in insolation and solar activity. We analysed a 42-cm-long sediment record from Lake Mountain located in East Siberia (Russia) for geochemical, mineralogical, subfossil diatoms, chironomids, and pollen to provide a reconstruction of the climate history of the area for the last 850 years. According to our reconstruction, a clear decrease in summer temperatures occurred in East Siberia after ca. 1400 and we linked this temperature drop with the beginning of the Little Ice Age. The coldest summer occurred about ca. 1570-1700 and 1830-1900. We assumed that the most significant changes of the lake bio-productivity and the catchment area were occurred about ca. 1160-1350, 1350-1590, 1590-1730, 1730-1900 and 1940 to the present. The most dramatic period with unfavorable climate conditions for lake-biota was during 1590-1730.

On average, turbidity at open water and vegetated areas was reduced by 40 and 60 percent, respectively, following carp exclusion. However, responses by plants and other trophic levels have been both spatially and temporally variable due in part to annual variation in environmental conditions and fish-zooplankton interactions. In 1997, an unusually cool spring delayed the migration of spawning fish, including a usually abundant planktivore population, into the marsh. This had three main effects: 1) large Daphnia were released from predation in early summer and reached unprecedented numbers (530 Daphnia/L) in open water areas, 2) despite the lack of vegetated marsh habitat, larval fish production was high due to reduced predation and abundant zooplankton prey, and 3) zooplankton grazing initiated a spring clear-water phase which, together with carp exclusion, promoted submerged plant growth in shallow areas previously devoid of vegetation. These newly vegetated areas showed the greatest improvements in clarity and macrophyte growth in the first 2 years following exclusion. Currently, however, the future of the biomanipulation remains uncertain, due in part to natural climatic confounding factors, and further remedial actions will be required before this wetland represents a stable, clear-water, macrophyte dominated state.

Heavy Metals Content in Water, Sediment, and Fish (Mugil cephalus) From Koycegiz Lagoon System in Turkey: Approaches for Assessing Environmental and Health Risk	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The concentration of heavy metals (Hg, Cd, As, Cu, Pb, Cr, and Zn) in the water, sediment and fish (Mugil cephalus) were investigated from different sites on Koycegiz Lagoon System. Potential ecological risk analysis of heavy metal concentrations in sediments underlined considerable ecological risk for two sites of the lagoon during winter and spring. The ratio of transfer factors of Hg, Cr, Cu, Zn, and As in fish from water was higher than 1, which means that fish undergo bioaccumulation of these elements from lagoon water. The determination of individual Target Hazard Quotients (THQs) in fish tissue indicated safe levels for the local people, but there is a possible risk in terms of total THQ because the highest THQ value of As suggests that they may experience a certain degree of adverse health effect.

We investigated the source of sulfide and the activity of these communities. Isotopic analysis of sulfide and sulfate in the spring water showed a fractionation of 39-50 parts per thousand indicative of active sulfate reduction. Sulfate reduction rates (SRR) in the spring sediment (< 2.8 nmol cm(-3) day(-1)) are too low to account for the measured sulfide flux. Thus, sulfide from the springs, locally reduced salinity and O-2 from the Dead Sea water are responsible for the abundant microbial biomass around the springs. The springs flow is highly variable and accordingly the local salinities. We speculate that the development of microbial mats dominated by either Sulfurimonas/Sulfurovum-like or Thiobacillus/Acidithiobacillus-like sulfide-oxidizing bacteria, results from different mean salinities in the microenvironment of the mats. SRR of up to 10 nmol cm(-3) day(-1) detected in the Dead Sea sediment are surprisingly higher than in the less saline springs. While this shows the presence of an extremely halophilic sulfate-reducing bacteria community in the Dead Sea sediments, it also suggests that extensive salinity fluctuations limit these communities in the springs due to increased energetic demands for osmoregulation.					; de Beer, Dirk/L-4840-2013; Ionescu, Danny/P-3261-2017; CNR, Ismar/P-1247-2014; Siebert, Christian/D-3380-2013; Holtappels, Moritz/ABC-7901-2020	Holtappels, Moritz/0000-0003-3682-1903; de Beer, Dirk/0000-0001-5274-1781; Ionescu, Danny/0000-0002-4658-8597; CNR, Ismar/0000-0001-5351-1486; Siebert, Christian/0000-0001-7266-8112; 													0168-6496	1574-6941				DEC	2014	90	3					956	969		10.1111/1574-6941.12449	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1574-6941.12449								25348393					WOS:000346057900035
J	Li, CG; Wang, MD; Sun, Z; Cao, MM; Hou, JZ				Li, Can-Ge; Wang, Mingda; Sun, Zhe; Cao, Mengmeng; Hou, Juzhi			Relationship between Holocene lake water temperature and glacier meltwater on the northwestern Tibetan Plateau	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Understanding the relationship between glacier meltwater and lake water temperature changes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is important for water resources management, environmental protection, and geological risk analysis. Summer temperature is one of the main factors affecting glacier evolution, yet we lack summer temperature records for high-altitude regions where glaciers are widely developed. In this study, we established a calibration between TEX86, which measures the abundance of aquatic isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (isoGDGTs) of Group I.1a aquatic Thaumarchaeota, and mean annual lake water temperature (MLWT) for 17 surface sediment samples from 10 lakes on the TP (MLWT = 4.1x TEX86 + 2.6 degrees C, R2 = 0.77). Given that lakes freeze during the cold season, MLWT is a record of the warm season temperature, especially the summerbiased temperature. We applied this calibration to reconstruct a Holocene MLWT record for Bangdag Co, a highaltitude hydrologically-closed lake (4909 m a.s.l.) on the northwestern TP, where glaciers are widely developed. The record shows low temperatures during the early Holocene, high temperatures during the middle Holocene, and a cooling trend during the middle to late Holocene. The MLWT is negatively correlated with the glacial meltwater volume during the early Holocene, indicating a large glacial meltwater influx to the lake at this time which resulted in low lake-water temperatures. Following the decrease in summer insolation during the middle to late Holocene, summer temperatures decreased and thus glacier meltwater production decreased. The MLWT shows a significant positive correlation with the glacial meltwater volume during the middle to late Holocene, which indicates that glacier meltwater barely influenced the MLWT, which was mainly controlled by the summer air temperature. Overall, when the air temperature decreased, the MLWT was low and the glacier meltwater production decreased. Our MLWT record for Bangdag Co agrees well with the cooling trend evident in summer temperature records and model simulations for the TP during the middle to late Holocene, which can be primarily attributed to decreasing summer insolation.

J	Eckmann, R				Eckmann, R			Overwinter changes in mass and lipid content of Perca fluviatilis and Gymnocephalus cernuus	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The body condition, lipid reserves and mortality of 0 and 1 year-old perch Perca fluviatilis and ruffe Gymnocephalus cernuus, sampled during the winter in Lake Constance, Germany, were compared. Length-frequency analyses did not provide evidence for overwinter mortality in either species. The fresh and dry mass of perch as well as their lipid contents decreased during winter, while ruffe were heavier and contained more lipid at the end of the winter. The superior performance of ruffe was mainly attributed to its sensory capabilities, which allowed it to ingest zoobenthos throughout the winter, while the zooplankton feeding of perch was constrained by low light levels. In lakes that undergo a process of re-oligotrophication, this advantage of ruffe over perch may be even more pronounced, since lower food supply during the growth season and thus lower fish lipid content at the start of winter is probably better tolerated by ruffe than by perch.

Loboi swamp in Kenya is fed by three hot springs: Lake Bogoria Hotel, Chelaba and Turtle Springs, hosting natural populations of Oreochromis niloticus. The present study aimed at better genetic characterization of these threatened populations. Partial mtDNA sequences of the D-loop region and variations at 16 microsatellite loci were assessed in the three hot spring populations and compared with three other natural populations of O. niloticus in the region. Results obtained indicated that the hot spring populations had mitochondrial and nuclear genetic variability similar to or higher than the large closely related populations. This may be attributed to the perennial nature of the hot springs, which do not depend on rainfall but rather receive permanent water supply from deep aquifers. The study also revealed that gene flow between the three different hot spring populations was sufficiently low thus allowing their differentiation. This differentiation was unexpected considering the very close proximity of the springs to each other. It is possible that the swamp creates a barrier to free movement of fish from one spring to the other thereby diminishing gene flow. Finally, the most surprising and worrying results were that the three hot spring populations are introgressed by mtDNA genes of O. leucostictus, while microsatellite analysis suggested that some nuclear genes may also have crossed the species barrier. It is very likely that the recent intensification of aquaculture activities in the Loboi drainage may be responsible for these introgressions. Taking into account the importance of these new genetic resources, protection and management actions of the Loboi swamp should be accorded top priority to prevent the loss of these spring populations.

There were significant spatial differences in the nature of this relationship. In the northern and central regions of the lake, concentrations of nonalgal suspended solids, tripton, were high due to muddy sediments and polymictic conditions. Light attenuation was predominantly correlated to the concentration of tripton and chlorophyll a concentrations were positively correlated to mean light availability in the mixed layer, I-m. The western and southern regions of the lake had lower concentrations of tripton and light attenuation was correlated to chlorophyll a concentrations in summer and fall. Variables which estimate mean light availability in the mixed layer, such as I-m, may provide insight into the role of light availability in the control of phytoplankton standing crop.

The lake temperature and its spatial and seasonal variation are important in that they control the solubility of chemical species and the liquid density which in turn affects the lake temperature via lake overturning. The lake temperature is calculated by a thermal stratification model of a lake coupled to a 3-dimensional atmospheric general circulation model. The lake temperature varies by up to 7 K with season, particularly at high latitudes. Slow lake overturning occurs in autumn and winter, which intensifies the seasonality at deeper layers. The solubility of minor species is controlled by the annual minimum lake temperature which decreases with latitude, as with the solubility. Virtually all solid minor species would sink in the lake, but due to seasonal lake overturning light species can be readily suspended rather than being permanently deposited on the lake bottom. Near-surface methane mixing ratio in the atmosphere undergoes similar seasonal variation, depending on the lake composition, because the thermodynamic equilibrium between gas and liquid is sensitive to the temperature.

J	Wang, ZC; Zhou, YY; Li, DH				Wang, Zhicong; Zhou, Yiyong; Li, Dunhai			The effect of gradient cooling on bloom decline in Microcystis (Cyanophyceae, Chroococcales)	PHYCOLOGIA												Microcystis blooms occur frequently in many eutrophic lakes during periods of warm temperature and disappear when the temperature becomes lower. Seasonal decreases in water temperature might be a key factor leading to the decline of Microcystis blooms. However, to date, there have been few studies investigating the effects of decreasing temperature on Microcystis in lakes. Our present study found that the gradually decreased temperature could result in a decline in Microcystis biomass. In the initial experimental phase (> 22 degrees C), Microcystis colonies could acclimate to the decreasing temperature through regulation of pigment content and photosynthetic activity. When the temperature reached 18 degrees C, the photosynthetic activity (photochemical quenching, maximum electron transport rate and half-saturated light intensity) significantly decreased, and excess excitation energy, as represented by nonphotosynthetic quenching, gradually increased. Photodamage to the Microcystis photosystem might be alleviated through accumulation of carotenoids. In addition, as temperature decreased, Microcystis colonies gradually disaggregated, and flotation velocity decreased rapidly. Our results indicated that temperature decrease did significantly inhibit the photosynthetic activity of Microcystis, which could lead to decreased algal biomass. Since decreasing temperature in later autumn and/or winter is a common phenomenon, we conclude this seasonal cooling is an important reason for the disappearance of Microcystis blooms.

Mean seasonal fluctuations of abundances were derived from long term data series collected from 1978 to 2003 for both species. In situ predator-prey experiments over a seasonal cycle were used to estimate the seasonal variation of the consumption rate of N. integer on E. affinis and to verify the order of magnitude of the biological parameters given by the model. Predator-prey experiments revealed a high seasonal variation in maximum consumption rates with a mean of 56 +/- 9 ind. pred(-1) d(-1). Maxinium consumption rates were always higher for adults than for juveniles of Neomysis integer. Recorded selectivities were higher on nauplii than on copepodids + adults of Eurytemora affinis, both for the juveniles and the adults of N. integer. Neomysis integer mainly fed on meroplanktonic larvae, when they were available in higher abundances, than E. affinis in their environment. Spring increases of abundance for Eurytemora affinis copepodids + adults seemed to be mainly controlled by temperature whereas its decreasing abundance in summer was more related to Neomysis integer predation, suggesting that summer fluctuations of E. affinis abundance are probably controlled by mysid predation at summer times. Using a Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model, the seasonal peak of abundance of the mysid N. integer was well reproduced considering a predation on copepodids + adults of E. affinis, and suggested a dependence between mysid and copepod seasonal variations. However, the seasonal peak amplitude could not be explained solely by a predation on copepodids + adults or on nauplii of the copepod. Thus, N. integer is probably dependent on the seasonal fluctuations of the copepod's abundance, complementing its diet with macrophytal detritus during periods of scarce food. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Kootenai River velocities, depth, and white sturgeon spawning site selection - a mystery unraveled?	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												P>The Kootenai River white sturgeon Acipenser transmontanus population in Idaho, US and British Columbia (BC), Canada became recruitment limited shortly after Libby Dam became fully operational on the Kootenai River, Montana, USA in 1974. In the USA the species was listed under the Endangered Species Act in September of 1994. Kootenai River white sturgeon spawn within an 18-km reach in Idaho, river kilometer (rkm) 228.0-246.0. Each autumn and spring Kootenai River white sturgeon follow a 'short two-step' migration from the lower river and Kootenay Lake, BC, to staging reaches downstream of Bonners Ferry, Idaho. Initially, augmented spring flows for white sturgeon spawning were thought to be sufficient to recover the population. Spring discharge mitigation enhanced white sturgeon spawning but a series of research investigations determined that the white sturgeon were spawning over unsuitable incubation and rearing habitat (sand) and that survival of eggs and larvae was negligible. It was not known whether post-Libby Dam management had changed the habitat or if the white sturgeon were not returning to more suitable spawning substrates farther upstream. Fisheries and hydrology researchers made a team effort to determine if the spawning habitat had been changed by Libby Dam operations. Researchers modeled and compared velocities, sediment transport, and bathymetry with post-Libby Dam white sturgeon egg collection locations. Substrate coring studies confirmed cobbles and gravel substrates in most of the spawning locations but that they were buried under a meter or more of post-Libby Dam sediment. Analysis suggested that Kootenai River white sturgeon spawn in areas of highest available velocity and depths over a range of flows. Regardless of the discharge, the locations of accelerating velocities and maximum depth do not change and spawning locations remain consistent. Kootenai River white sturgeon are likely spawning in the same locations as pre-dam, but post-Libby Dam water management has reduced velocities and shear stress, thus sediment is now covering the cobbles and gravels. Although higher discharges will likely provide more suitable spawning and rearing conditions, this would be socially and politically unacceptable because it would bring the river elevation to or in excess of 537.66 m, which is flood stage.

Also, the banding pattern in 4 of the 7 chromosome arms differs between the species. The banding patterns belong to the most primitive ones in the thummi-complex. An inversion polymorphism has been found in arms A and B of C. tenuistylus, in arm B (rarely D and F) of C. longistylus. The larvae of C. tenuistylus have a distinct dark strip on the clypeus and blackish coloured antennal pedicel and gula, and also differ in certain head measurements. Male adults of C. tenuistylus are larger than those of C. longistylus and the anal point of the male hypopygium is not as broad. Both species show an holarctic distribution (Fennoscandia and northern USA). The breeding habitats overlap to some extent, but C. tenuistylus apparently prefers polyhumic waters, whereas C. longistylus prefers flat, eutrophied lakes and pools. Adults of C. tenuistylus emerge in autumn, those of C. longistylus in summer.																			0013-8711						1991	22	2					231	240																WOS:A1991GB60900010

This O2 sensitivity is based on the dependence of the oxidizers on an O2-sensitive N fixation process. Thus epilimnetic methane oxidation is absent during periods of nitrogen limitation, since high epilimnetic O2 concentrations prevent N fixation. During periods of overturn and throughout the winter, the methane oxidizers become O2 insensitive and oxidation occurs rapidly throughout the water column. This O2 insensitivity likely occurs as a result of high in situ concentrations of dissolved inorganic N, which replaces N fixation as a source for fixed N. Under ice-cover, rapid methane oxidation throughout the water column can be a major cause of total anoxia.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1976	21	3					357	364		10.4319/lo.1976.21.3.0357	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1976.21.3.0357													WOS:A1976BS77000002

We use historical and recent remote sensing data to study glacier changes of the Lahaul-Spiti region in western Himalaya, India, over the last four decades (1971-2013). The glaciers were losing mass moderately between 1971 and 1999 (-0.07 +/- 0.1 m w.e. year(-1)) while the losses have increased significantly after 2000 (-0.30 +/- 0.1 m w.e. year(-1)). During both periods, the debris-covered glaciers and glaciers having pro-glacial lakes lost more mass than glaciers with little debris cover. Mass changes of Chhota Shigri, a benchmark glacier, closely matched the average of the overall study area. Analysis of gridded climate data covering the period 1948-2015 shows that the mean annual air temperature increased, especially since 1995. One dataset shows a significant increase in summer temperature after 2000 while others do not show any trend. The mean annual precipitation started decreasing around 1995 and reached a minimum around 2000, after which it increased again. One dataset shows a significant decrease in winter precipitation after 2000 while the others show no trend. The climate data indicate that the increase in mean annual temperature from 1995, combined with no significant trend/significant decrease of winter precipitation in the period after 2000, has probably resulted in accelerated mass loss of the glaciers.					; Ghosh, Susmita/Z-2906-2019; Bolch, Tobias/A-1935-2008; Mukherjee, Kriti/ABB-9229-2020; Bhattacharya, Atanu/AAU-9787-2021; Bolch, Tobias/ABE-6635-2020	Bhattacharya, Atanu/0000-0001-7449-3897; Bolch, Tobias/0000-0002-8201-5059; Mukherjee, Kriti/0000-0002-2290-2676; 													0165-0009	1573-1480				MAY	2018	148	1-2					219	233		10.1007/s10584-018-2185-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-018-2185-3													WOS:000431788500015

Here we provide a continuous, well-dated, high-resolution record from Huguangyan maar lake located in the west Pacific climate regime. Multi-proxies including chlorophyll a, TOC, Sr/Rb ratio and magnetic susceptibility have been used to reconstruct the monsoon variations in the Holocene. Higher chlorophyll a values are related with stronger summer monsoon, and vice versa. High-temporal resolution radiocarbon dating enables us to divide summer monsoon evolution stages. Summer monsoon in Zhanjiang area was strongest in the early Holocene but began to decline at 6080 yr BP, and weakened substantially since about 3600 yr BP. The transition around 6080 yr BP, supported by our high-resolution dating, lags the previous estimates by similar to 1700 years. The decreasing summer solar radiation at 30 degrees N through the Holocene is probably responsible for gradually weakened summer monsoon. The anti-phased co-variation of summer monsoon intensity and ENSO activity throughout the Holocene suggests that they could be interlinked, driven together by solar radiation at orbital scale.

Potential effects of enhancing denitrification rates in sediments of the Sulejow reservoir	ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION ENGINEERING												Denitrification is quantitatively the most important process of removing nitrates from freshwater ecosystems, thus contributing to the reduction of eutrophication. Littoral denitrification rates in a research period from 1998-2001 ranged from 0 to 833 mu mol N-2 m(-2) h(-1) and was mainly determined by organic carbon availability in the sediments (r = 0.6) It was calculated that 18.5% of the external total nitrogen load incoming to the reservoir was removed from the bottom sediments via denitrification. This value can be increased by enhancing sedimentation of organic matter, thus increasing the organic carbon content in littoral zones of the upper section of the reservoir. Enhanced denitrification lowers the N/P ratio and inhibits phytoplankton growth, especially during spring period. During summer, water temperature increases and cyanobacteria dominate, lowering the N/P ratio, which may provide an advantage in competition for nutrients over other phytoplankton groups.

These five lakes differed in trophic status and rotifer community structure. Twenty-nine rotifer species were collected, of which Keratella cochlearis, Polyarthra dolichoptera, and Trichocerca elongate were dominant. The mean density, Shannon-Wiener diversity, and equitability among the five lakes differed significantly (P < 0.05). The mean rotifer density was positively correlated with trophic state. The diversity was higher in lakes with high macrophyte coverage. The composition of rotifer species was closely associated with the trophic gradient. Five environmental variables, Secchi depth, conductivity, TN, NH4-N, and TP, significantly affected the composition of rotifer species. Keratella quadrata, Brachionus calyciflorus, and B. forficula were more common in eutrophic conditions. Our results suggest that eutrophication has a significant influence on the rotifer community structure and highlight the potential for using rotifer community structure as an indicator of trophic status in subtropical lakes.					; Li, Zhongjie/J-1474-2018; LI, WEI/ISS-1208-2023	Ye, Shaowen/0000-0003-3932-8401; 													0254-4059	1993-5005				SEP	2014	32	5					1083	1091		10.1007/s00343-014-3354-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-014-3354-5													WOS:000340879900013
J	Li, Y; Wang, N; Zhou, XH; Zhang, CQ; Wang, Y				Li, Yu; Wang, Nai'ang; Zhou, Xuehua; Zhang, Chengqi; Wang, Yue			Synchronous or asynchronous Holocene Indian and East Asian summer monsoon evolution: A synthesis on Holocene Asian summer monsoon simulations, records and modern monsoon indices	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Holocene climate records obtained from the Asian summer monsoon domain suggest a regionally-delineated response to changing summer monsoon. The interaction between the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and the Indian summer monsoon (ISM), two subsystems of the Asian summer monsoon, has been considered as a factor that explains those inconsistent Holocene climate records. However, this assumption is not valid when the relationship between the two subsystems is not clear. This paper presents a literature review regarding climate simulation of the Asian summer monsoon for testing the long-term relationship. The absolutely-dated Holocene speleothem records in the EASM domain and the ISM domain were compared to verify the simulation results. In addition, a unified monsoon index, which has a unified solid dynamic basis and is appropriate for different monsoon regions, was used in order to identify the modern relationship between the two subsystems. The speleothem records show more synchronous than asynchronous on the Holocene millennial-scale monsoon evolution, furthermore the two subsystems respond to the Younger Dryas (YD) and 8.2 ka events in a similar way. However, these monsoon simulations roughly suggest that the two subsystems respond to Holocene climate change in different ways. While the simulations were mostly performed in a certain period of the Holocene, the speleothem records provided a relatively continuous Asian summer monsoon history. Therefore, time scales could affect the comparison between simulations and speleothem records. Then, we further discussed the interaction between the Asian monsoon subsystems according to simulations and modem monsoon indices. Overall, the relationship between the two subsystems is more complicated than synchronous or asynchronous, which is a dynamic relationship and related to the atmosphere-land-ocean-vegetation interaction. In addition, the relationship can vary over different time scales, and the links between time scales should be paid more attention to. Besides, the interaction between the westerly winds and the Asian summer monsoon in the mid-latitudes of East Asia will profoundly affect those areas in response to Holocene climate change. It is recommended that further research should be emphasized in dynamic mechanisms between the Asian summer monsoon subsystems and between the Asian monsoon and the westerly winds.

This study conducted a systematic investigation of the phytoplankton community structure and its environmental drivers in 17 artificial reservoirs in the Ili region of Xinjiang in August and October 2024. The Ili region is located in the temperate continental arid zone of northwestern China. A total of 209 phytoplankton species were identified, with Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta, and Cyanobacteria comprising over 92% of the community, indicating an oligarchic dominance pattern. The decoupling between numerical dominance (diatoms) and biomass dominance (cyanobacteria) revealed functional differentiation and ecological complementarity among major taxa. Through multivariate analyses, including Mantel tests, principal component analysis (PCA), and redundancy analysis (RDA), we found that phytoplankton community structures at different ecological levels responded distinctly to environmental gradients. Oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), dissolved oxygen (DO), and mineralization parameters (EC, TDS) were key drivers of morphological operational taxonomic unit (MOTU). In contrast, dominant species (SP) were more responsive to salinity and pH. A seasonal analysis demonstrated significant shifts in correlation structures between summer and autumn, reflecting the regulatory influence of the climate on redox conditions and nutrient solubility. Machine learning using the random forest model effectively identified core taxa (e.g., MOTU1 and SP1) with strong discriminatory power, confirming their potential as bioindicators for water quality assessments and the early warning of ecological shifts. These core taxa exhibited wide spatial distribution and stable dominance, while localized dominant species showed high sensitivity to site-specific environmental conditions. Our findings underscore the need to integrate taxonomic resolution with functional and spatial analyses to reveal ecological response mechanisms in arid-zone reservoirs. This study provides a scientific foundation for environmental monitoring, water resource management, and resilience assessments in climate-sensitive freshwater ecosystems.					訾, 方泽/GRS-8690-2022															2079-7737				JUL 22	2025	14	8							914	10.3390/biology14080914	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology14080914								40906130					WOS:001557910600001

Two methods that rely on the distribution of aquatic plants are useful for locating springs. One method identifies areas of the near-shore lakebed where floating-leaf and emergent aquatic vegetation are absent. The second method uses the distribution of marsh marigold (Caltha palustris L,) to locate springs that discharge on land near the shoreline of the lake, Marsh marigold produces large (2 to -1 cm diameter) yellow flowers that provide a ready marker for locating ground water springs. Twice as many springs (38) were identified using this method as were identified using the lack of near-shore vegetation, A portable weir was used to measure discharge from onshore springs, and seepage meters mere used to measure discharge from near-shore springs. Of the total 56.7 h, s(-1) that enters the lake from ground water, approximately 30% comes from onshore and near-shore springs.

Attached and free-living bacterial abundance, proportion of active bacteria, density of suspended particles and biomass of cladocerans were also monitored. Heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF; 5-12.8 10(2) ml-1) were the dominant bacterial micrograzers during the spring period and consumed 3 to 9 % of the total bacteria per day. After the spring phytoplankton bloom maximum densities of suspended particles and attached bacteria (up to 28 % of the total counts) were found. Development of cladocerans in May sharply decreased the proportion of attached bacteria and kept them below 5 % of the total counts. All the studied components of plankton except Cladocera decreased during the clearwater phase. The most significant drop was observed in the numbers of protozoans, and they were negligible for bacterial elimination. Bacterial losses during that time apparently were due to cladoceran grazing. During the summer period, ciliates (15-142 ml-1) were mostly dominant micrograzers, and protozoan community grazing increased up to 21 % of bacterial standing stock per day. The proportion of active bacteria was strongly correlated with protozoan grazing (r = 0.83).					; Seda, Jaromir/F-9072-2014; Macek, Miroslav/B-5428-2015; Šimek, Karel/AAB-1956-2021	Simek, Karel/0000-0002-7058-9063; Macek, Miroslav/0000-0003-0600-3539; 													0020-9309						1990	75	5					583	596		10.1002/iroh.19900750502	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19900750502													WOS:A1990FX83200002

Facies architecture in depositional systems resulting from the interaction of acidic springs, alkaline springs, and acidic lakes: case study of Lake Roto-a-Tamaheke, Rotorua, New Zealand	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The facies architecture in hot spring systems tends to become more varied and complicated as the degrees of freedom in the system increase. Discharge aprons fed by waters from a single vent will, for example, be characterized by predictable downslope facies changes that reflect downslope changes in water chemistry and temperature. The facies architecture, however, becomes exponentially more intricate when more factors start to impact the system. This phenomenon is readily apparent in the geothermal area around Lake Roto-a-Tamaheke (located in the Whakarewarewa Thermal Village, Rotorua, New Zealand) where the facies architecture developed in response to the interactions between acid lake, acid hot spring, and alkaline hot spring depositional regimes, with additional extraneous sediment being brought into the area by volcanic ash clouds, wind-blown pollen, and surface run-off from the surrounding drainage basin. Much of the complexity in the facies architecture of this system stems from the temporal variance in the lake level and the variable life cycles of the acid and alkaline hot springs. Fluctuations in lake level controlled the extent of lacustrine deposits, and flooding commonly quenched spring activity. During some periods various minerals precipitated around the acidic springs, whereas during other periods silica precipitated around the hot alkaline springs that are preferentially located along faults that transect the area. The interaction of all of these variables produces depositional regimes with largely unpredictable and highly variable facies architectures. As such, they contrast sharply with the more organized spring systems that develop when one type of water flows from a single vent.

Underevaluation of Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Patients With Nonaccidental Falls	JOURNAL OF PRIMARY CARE AND COMMUNITY HEALTH												Background: The incidence of adult patients with falls seeking medical assistance in the Salt Lake City area, Utah, is 28,000 per million adult inhabitants. Objective: We sought to evaluate the prevalence of cardiovascular risk assessment and cardiovascular abnormalities in patients presenting with nonaccidental falls at the University of Utah hospital and its affiliated clinics. Methods: We conducted a search of all patients in the University of Utah patient database as well as 9 affiliated primary care and family practice clinics in Utah who were evaluated for a "fall" during October 2009. We analyzed the records of 338 patients who had a fall within the previous 3 months. Nonaccidental falls were defined as falls unrelated to a contact incident or "slip or trip." Results: Nonaccidental falls occurred in 81 (24%) patients, 39 of these being >= 65 years old. Cardiovascular risk assessment and specifically orthostatic testing were evaluated in 40% and 3% of the patients, respectively. In patients >= 65 years old, the prevalence of cardiovascular risk assessment, orthostatic testing, and carotid sinus massage were equally low at 56%, 5%, and 0%, respectively. Cardiovascular abnormalities were present in 17 (21%) patients, with 9 of them being referred for cardiac evaluation. Conclusion: Our results highlight the inconsistent assessment of potential cardiovascular risk factors in patients with nonaccidental falls, supporting the adoption of a standardized approach in these patients.

Characterizing the Flow Regime in Brook Trout Incubation Habitats and Implications for Management in a Hydro-Regulated River	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The operation of dams, diversions, and power generation facilities unavoidably influence the ecological function of rivers. We evaluated vertical and horizontal hydraulic gradients and subsequent water temperature changes in the hyporheic zone of a spawning area for Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis in a managed Lake Superior tributary in Ontario, then conducted a laboratory-based experiment to show the impact of cold shock during incubation on the timing of larval emergence and survival. Upwelling groundwater was observed at the spawning area during the monitoring period (October 28, 2016, to January 11, 2017); hyporheic water temperatures remained above 3.7 degrees C, whereas ambient river temperature above the substrate fell to 1.5 degrees C until water was released from the upstream control dam. After the release event, water level increased by 0.9 m over the spawning area, and within 24 h, vertical and horizontal flow gradients were reversed in the hyporheic zone; downwelling conditions were observed for 30 h between surface and hyporheic water 1.8 m below substrate, and hyporheic water temperature decreased in unison. Hyporheic temperatures at shallow inshore sites fell below 1 degrees C for more than 53 h. In the laboratory, applying a worst-case scenario of dam-induced cold shock on Brook Trout redds using historic monitoring records (i.e., <1.0 degrees C for 40 h), we found no appreciable effect on survival and development timing of incubating Brook Trout eggs compared with a control group. Survival from fertilization to hatching was high for both treatment and control groups (>90%) and lower from fertilization to emergence (55%). Overall, our results suggest that standard winter operating procedures on a Lake Superior tributary had little impact on Brook Trout egg survival and development time to hatching and emergence; however, our findings also suggest that staged winter discharges would lessen the reversal of flow in the hyporheic zone and the magnitude of temperature changes experienced at Brook Trout redds.					; Gibson, Daniel/F-2743-2013	Mackereth, Robert/0000-0002-5017-1567; 													0275-5947	1548-8675				OCT	2022	42	5					1097	1110		10.1002/nafm.10801	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10801		AUG 2022											WOS:000842785900001

Archaeological Investigations at the Ikirahak Site Raise Questions Concerning Taltheilei Land Use in Southern Nunavut	ARCTIC												We report a new Taltheilei site-type found off the west coast of Hudson Bay in southern Nunavut. The Taltheilei is an archaeological culture that existed in the Barrenlands of the central Canadian Subarctic between 2600 and 300 years ago. Their land use strategies were tethered to the seasonal migrations of the Beverly and Qamanirjuaq caribou herds throughout tundra and forest landscapes. Tundra-based sites are typically interpreted as short-lived summer camps, but our discovery of three unique pit-house sites on the shores of Maguse Lake raises new questions concerning diversity in Taltheilei tundra land use. Architectural, faunal, lithic, and geoarchaeological data recovered from the Ikirahak site (JjKs-7) support the hypothesis that Taltheilei groups were extending their tundra stays into the fall. We report the evidence from four excavated pit-house features. Terraced platforms along the internal perimeters of these houses suggest they were designed for cold season use. The faunal assemblage is dominated by caribou remains. Higher relative frequencies of appendicular elements suggest a focus on secondary butchering. A large fraction of the faunal assemblage is highly fragmented and calcined, which is consistent with heavy processing and the use of bone as an alternative fuel source. Higher frequencies of lithic debris around dwelling floor perimeters are suggestive of maintenance activities. Multi-element concentrations in dwelling and site-wide sediments also show that hearth refuse was dumped outside. These findings seem to reflect longer tundra occupations during fall, a land use strategy that was likely guided by Qamanirjuaq herd behaviour specific to the Maguse Lake area, fall hunting and processing goals, and ecologically couched mobility logistics. As just four pit-houses from one Taltheilei camp have been investigated to date, our understanding of these places within Taltheilei worlds and northern socio-ecologies is currently limited.

In this study, we applied a microfluidic quantitative PCR (MFQPCR) approach to simultaneously quantify multiple waterborne pathogens in a natural freshwater lake in Hokkaido, Japan, from April to November, 2012. Tens of thousands of geese stopped over at this lake during their migration in spring and fall. Because lake water is used for irrigation of the surrounding agricultural area, we assessed infection risks through irrigation water usage based on pathogen concentrations directly measured by MFQPCR. We detected various pathogens in the lake water, particularly during the bird migration seasons, suggesting that migratory birds were the main source of the pathogens. However, neither counts of geese nor fecal indicator bacteria were good predictors of pathogen concentrations. On the basis of quantitative microbial risk assessment, concentrations of Campylobacter jejuni and Shigella spp. in water samples were above the concentrations that can potentially cause 10 infections per person per year when water is used to grow fresh vegetables. These results suggest that direct and simultaneous multipathogen quantification can provide more reliable and comprehensive information for risk assessment than the current fecal indicator-based approach.

An Odd Oxygen Framework for Wintertime Ammonium Nitrate Aerosol Pollution in Urban Areas: NOx and VOC Control as Mitigation Strategies	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Wintertime ammonium nitrate aerosol pollution is a severe air quality issue affecting both developed and rapidly urbanizing regions from Europe to East Asia. In the United States, it is acute in western basins subject to inversions that confine pollutants near the surface. Measurements and modeling of a wintertime pollution episode in Salt Lake Valley, Utah, demonstrate that ammonium nitrate is closely related to photochemical ozone through a common parameter, total odd oxygen, O-x,O-total. We show that the traditional nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compound (NOx-VOC) framework for evaluating ozone mitigation strategies also applies to ammonium nitrate. Despite being nitrate-limited, ammonium nitrate aerosol pollution in Salt Lake Valley is responsive to VOCs control and, counterintuitively, not initially responsive to NOx control. We demonstrate simultaneous nitrate limitation and NOx saturation and suggest this phenomenon may be general. This finding may identify an unrecognized control strategy to address a global public health issue in regions with severe winter aerosol pollution. Plain Language Summary Particulate matter (PM) is dangerous to human health and impacts visibility and climate. In the United States, Europe, and Asia, PM is severe in urban areas in the winter when ammonium nitrate, NH4NO3, comprises an appreciable fraction of the total PM mass. A key control strategy is to reduce emissions of the limiting reagent. Using measurements from a recent field campaign in the Salt Lake Valley, Utah, which experiences high PM levels in winter, we demonstrate that emission control strategies can be evaluated using the same framework commonly used to control ozone, another common pollutant that occurs at high levels in urban areas in the summer. We show that initial control of the NOx precursor is ineffective at reducing NH4NO3 aerosol in the Salt Lake Valley, while initial control of volatile organic compounds, which are not a direct precursor for either nitrate or ammonium, is effective due to their influence on oxidation cycles. This finding differs from many mitigation strategies in the western United States and may also be relevant to other regions in Europe and Asia which experience high wintertime PM.

Here, remote sensing data and machine learning techniques that could support or substitute traditional field-based data collection are evaluated. For the Bay of Quinte on Lake Ontario, Canada, different combinations of multi-angle/temporal quad pol RADARSAT-2, simulated compact pol RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and high and low spatial resolution Digital Elevation and Surface Models (DEM and DSM, respectively) were used to classify six land cover classes with Random Forests: shallow water, marsh, swamp, water, forest, and agriculture/non-forested. Results demonstrate that high accuracies can be achieved with multi-temporal SAR data alone (e.g., user's and producer's accuracies 90% for a model based on a spring image and a summer image), or via fusion of SAR and DEM and DSM data for single dates/incidence angles (e.g., user's and producer's accuracies 90% for a model based on a spring image, DEM, and DSM data). For all models based on single SAR images, simulated compact pol data generally achieved lower accuracies than quad pol RADARSAT-2 data. However, it was possible to compensate for observed differences through either multi-temporal/angle data fusion or the inclusion of DEM and DSM data (i.e., as a result, there was not a statistically significant difference between multiple models). With a higher repeat-pass cycle than RADARSAT-2, RCM is expected to be a reliable source of C-band SAR data that will contribute positively to ongoing efforts to inventory wetlands and monitor change in areas containing the same land cover classes evaluated here.

Zero enzyme activity was not reached until ice cover of the pond was complete, although even in the preceding two months no food was found in the guts of the fish. The summer diets of four size classes of fish consisted of varying proportions of planktonic and benthic arthropods, including Odonata which were consumed exclusively by the largest size class of crucian carp. Chironomid larvae were consumed even by the smallest fish investigated, although planktonic Cladocera were preferred by this size class. Benthic Cladocera were almost totally absent in the diet of fish > 10 cm. Habitat segregation between size classes developed synchronously with the shift to benthic food. The stunting of crucian carp populations in small ponds is interpreted as resulting from limited resources.																			0378-1909					JAN	1992	33	1-2					215	221		10.1007/BF00002566	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00002566													WOS:A1992HA38100019

Here we used multi-satellite data to explore three-decade surface area variations of Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China. Our results revealed that the water area had declined generally in the last three decades. There existed a downtrend period of about 10 years. Generally, the decreasing trend of the decline was found to be significantly related to basin-scale climate change. Furthermore, the seasonal data demonstrated the remarkable change in surface area from over 3000 km(2) in summer to less than 1000 km(2) in winter. In the period examined, the lake surface area shrank to minimum values in 2003 and 2006. This was possibly related to land-use and land-cover change and construction of reservoirs in the basin, in addition to local climate change.																			0144-7815		978-1-907161-19-3				2011	344						215	220																WOS:000297611800035

Santiago, Fogo. Congro and Fumas (Island of Sao Miguel, Azores Archipelago, Portugal) were studied to investigate the biogeochemical processes acting at different depths, with a focus on the CO2 and CH2 dynamics. These lakes are fed by meteoric water affected by seawater spray and interacting with volcanic rocks at a relatively low extent. In addition to volcanogenic gas inputs, the biogeochemical processes are influenced by microbial activities since the lakes offer specialized ecological niches for oxic and anoxic metabolism. The lakes were sampled in two extreme conditions of (partial) mixing (winter) and stratification (summer), respectively. The seasonal thermal stratification favored the development of anaerobic hypolimnia, showing relatively high concentrations of NH4-, NO3-, P and other minor species (Fe, Mn. Zn, As) controlled by microbial activity and mineroizenetic processes occurring within the lake sediments. The strongly negative delta C-13-TDIC values measured in almost all the studied lakes suggest dominant contribution of organic carbon. Dissolved gases were mostly consisting of atmospheric compounds with significant conceithations of CO2 and CH4. The delta C-13-CO2 values were intermediate between those measured in the hydrothermal fluids and those typical of biogenic CO2. Dissolved CH4 which was the most abundant extra-atmospheric gas in the anoxic waters, was measured at significant concentrations even in the aerobic layers, especially in the winter season. This unexpected feature may tentatively be explained by admitting i) convective mixing of shallow and deep waters, and/or ii) aerobic CH4, production. Further investigations, focusing on the recognition of microbial populations able to produce CH4 at different redox conditions, may be useful to corroborate these intriguing hypotheses.

J	BRYSON, RA				BRYSON, RA			A MACROPHYSICAL MODEL OF THE HOLOCENE INTERTROPICAL CONVERGENCE AND JETSTREAM POSITIONS AND RAINFALL FOR THE SAHARAN REGION	METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS												Using a macrophysical model, it has been found possible to model the Late Pleistocene and Holocene history of glacial volume and mean temperature as a function of solar radiation seasonality and modulation of the solar radiation by volcanic aerosols (Bryson, 1988). From this model it has been possible to model the Indian monsoon with fair agreement with the field data (Bryson, 1989). The present paper represents an extension of this effort to the modeling of the position of the Intertropical Convergence in North Africa and the latitude of the atmospheric polar jetstream in the same longitudes. From these two latitudes it is possible to simulate the seasonal rainfall history of the Saharan region. The preliminary results suggest that maximum intrusion of summer rains into North Africa should have occurred between 11,000 and 5000 BP, with a lesser intrusion between 30,000 and 28,000 BP. Winter rains, though not abundant, should have been present in the central Sahara until 12,000 BP then diminishing to negligible by 8000 BP, according to the model. On the Mediterranean coast of North Africa, the winter rains should have been about 100% greater than the present until about 18,000 BP, diminishing to near the present value by about 8000 BP. Radiocarbon dated occupation sites appear to be most abundant at about the indicated times of greatest rainfall in sub-Saharan Africa, as does the frequency of high lake levels. A collateral purpose of this paper is to test the utility of the present inter-monthly changes in the parameterization of inter-century changes.																			0177-7971						1992	47	2-4					247	258		10.1007/BF01025621	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01025621													WOS:A1992JF25400013

Female Japanese eels (Anguilla japonica) were collected in the brackish Hamana Lake and its freshwater rivers from July to December. To clarify the effect of salinity, the habitat use history of the eels were determined using otolith microchemistry. Expression levels of mRNA of each hormone were determined using real time PCR. Although GH and PRL have been known to be osmoregulatory hormones, there were no consistent differences in expression levels of these hormones between different salinity habitats. In contrast, SL mRNA expression was higher in eels from freshwater rivers than from the brackish lake. GH mRNA expression clearly decreased during silvering, whereas PRL and SL mRNA expression did not change. We also showed that PRL mRNA and SL mRNA decreased in the brackish lake and PRL mRNA increased in freshwater rivers from autumn to early winter. These findings provide basic knowledge for a further understanding of the role of these hormones. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

J	CHIBA, O				CHIBA, O			THE TURBULENT CHARACTERISTICS IN THE LOWEST PART OF THE SEA-BREEZE FRONT IN THE ATMOSPHERIC SURFACE-LAYER	BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY												Tower measurements for the sea breeze front in the surface layer were carried out over the Kochi plain about 2 km inland from Tosa Bay in Shikoku, Japan during the period from August 1986 to October 1987. The study shows that the penetration time of the sea breeze has an annual variation, which is around 0830 JST in summer and 12 JST in winter, and that the width of the sea breeze front depends on the ratio of the sea breeze speed and the opposing flow speed. Moreover, the frontal width also shows a seasonal variation. The characteristics of the vertical winds (w) found just before and just after the passage of the sea breeze front lead to remarkable downdrafts and updrafts, respectively, with relatively large vertical velocities. Such behaviour of w is shown to be consistent with the flow relative to the head of the front as reviewed by Simpson (1987), influencing the magnitude of the turbulence scale and the turbulent energy dissipation near the ground surface.																			0006-8314	1573-1472				JUL	1993	65	1-2					181	195		10.1007/BF00708823	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00708823													WOS:A1993LR17800008

The data indicate generally higher-than-average runoff between c. 8.4 and 5 cal. kyr BP, correlative to the early Holocene Thermal Maximum. Except for the c. 2.2-2 cal. kyr BP humid event, runoff was lower than average over the last c. 5 cal. kyr BP. Latitudinal shifts in average position of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) caused by long-term changes in summer insolation was the principal forcing behind the varying summer season precipitation and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activity may explain some of the hydrological variability (e.g. higher-than-average summer precipitation during c. 2.2-2 cal. kyr BP). In general, the basin received more runoff during the periods of less frequent and weak ENSO, similar to the modern response to ENSO activity of the region. Significant increases in lake water salinity and aeolian activity over the last 2 cal. kyr BP correspond to stronger and more frequent ENSO during the late Holocene.

In autumn 2009, a dinoflagellate Heterocapsa circularisquama formed a bloom in this lake, causing mass mortality of a considerable proportion of the cultured Pacific oysters and fisheries damage estimated to be 190 million Japanese yen. Although the origin or cause of entry of the H circularisquama population into Lake Kamo is unknown, heavy stirring due to a large typhoon is considered to be a possible trigger of its blooming. This was the first attack by H. circularisquama in this lake; prior to this bloom, the northern limit of the distribution range of H circularisquama had been Obama Bay, Fukui, Japan (35 degrees 50'N, 135 degrees 72'E). A H. circularisquama bloom recurred in Lake Kamo in the summer of 2010, although it did not cause considerable damage to cultured oysters. This phenomenon is considered to be a typical case of the northward expansion of harmful algae in the Northern Hemisphere.					; Iwataki, Mitsunori/H-9640-2019	Matsuyama, Yukihiko/0000-0002-2775-1723; Iwataki, Mitsunori/0000-0002-5844-2800													0021-5392	1349-998X				JUL	2012	78	4					719	725																WOS:000308835900018

Here, we evaluated the importance of spatial and temporal variation in abiotic environmental factors for bacterial and microeukaryotic community assembly and distance-decay relationships in water and sediment niches in Hongze Lake. By sampling across the whole lake during both Autumn and Spring sampling time points, we show that only bacterial sediment communities were governed by deterministic community assembly processes due to abiotic environmental drivers. Nevertheless, consistent distance-decay relationships were found with both bacterial and microeukaryotic communities, which were relatively stable with both sampling time points. Our results suggest that spatio-temporal variation in environmental factors was important in explaining mainly bacterial community assembly in the sediment, possibly due lesser disturbance. However, clear distance-decay patterns emerged also when the community assembly was stochastic. Together, these results suggest that abiotic environmental factors do not clearly drive the spatial structuring of lake microbial communities, highlighting the need to understand the role of other potential drivers, such as spatial heterogeneity and biotic species interactions.					; Friman, Ville/OIU-7321-2025; Gu, Yian/IRZ-6531-2023	Friman, Ville-Petri/0000-0002-1592-157X; Gu, Yian/0000-0002-3011-3685													1462-2912	1462-2920				OCT	2023	25	10					1940	1954		10.1111/1462-2920.16437	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.16437		MAY 2023						37254577					WOS:000998593600001

The gas compositions are similar to 99% CO2, 0.0008 to 0.0078 mmol/mol H-2, 0.0004 to 0.062 mmol/mol He, 0.08 to 0.77 mmol/mol Ar, 3.1 to 28.5 mmol/mol N-2, 0.4 to 3.73 mmol/mol O-2, <0.002 to 1.541 mmol/mol CH4, <0.001 to 0.009 mmol/mol CO, and are poor in H2S (0.045 to 0201 mmol/mol). The CO2 flux at a local gas collection plant is estimated to be 1.6x 10(5) mol/year. Gas geothermometry indicates a range of equilibration temperatures from >250 degrees C (from CO2-Ar) to similar to 60 degrees C (from H-2-Ar), which is interpreted to reflect deep equilibration with hot saline fluids and shallow re-equilibration of kinetically fast gas geothermometers with cold meteoric recharge from the highlands. N-2-He-Ar systematics show that the gases fall on a well-defined mixing line between upper mantle or sub-continental lithospheric mantle and air saturated water endmembers. Details of an improved method for analyzing nitrogen isotope compositions in gas samples are presented. Nitrogen isotope compositions (delta N-15 values) range between +2 parts per thousand and 5.9 parts per thousand, overlapping with the upper mantle range, with only one sample location displaying delta N-15 values greater than air (0 parts per thousand). The results emphasize the importance of the East African Rift as a potential, but poorly constrained, contributor of sub-continental lithospheric mantle volatiles to the Earth's surface even in regions that are currently volcanically dormant, but are seismically active.

J	BODO, BA				BODO, BA			TREND ANALYSIS AND MASS-DISCHARGE ESTIMATION OF ATRAZINE IN SOUTHWESTERN ONTARIO GREAT-LAKES TRIBUTARIES - 1981-1989	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Aqueous concentration time series of the herbicide atrazine and its phytotoxic metabolite desethylatrazine obtained from 1981 to September 1990 in the Thames, Grand, and Saugeen rivers draining agricultural southwestern Ontario were analyzed to ascertain temporal trend, seasonal variation, and mass-discharge patterns. Substantial year-to-year changes were evident. Data suggest that the greatest applications of the decade might have occurred in 1984; however, in 1985 significant decreases in levels were observed at all three sites, apparently due to an abrupt shift away from corn cultivation. Mass-discharge estimates generally parallel the concentration trends but also reflect hydrometeorologic trends. In 1984 for the Thames basin, extremely high concentrations together with high flows combined to export about 13 tonnes (t) atrazine plus metabolite, the largest single annual loss to surface-water systems observed over the decade. Driven by the annual spring-summer application cycle, aqueous concentrations surge in late May to reach annual peaks in late June and early July. Despite the declining levels of recent years, Thames River data suggest that the probability of exceeding the Canadian water quality guideline of 2-mu-g/L for protection of aquatic life, primarily algae and vascular plants, may yet approach 65%. The greatest risks to susceptible species are likely associated with large summer storm runoff in areas of high soil to surface water transfer potential. Herbicide usage in general continues in large quantities, and continued surveillance appears warranted. Further research is required to ascertain the ultimate fate of these compounds in end receiving waters such as the Great Lakes.																			0730-7268	1552-8618					1991	10	9					1105	1121		10.1002/etc.5620100902	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620100902													WOS:A1991GE72500002

All the taxa were found at littoral bottoms shallower than 20 m, and 79% (23 taxa) occurred there exclusively. The profundal bottoms deeper than 40 m were inhabited by three tubificids (Rhyacodrilus komarovi, Tubifex tubifex and Tubificidae gen. sp.) and one lumbriculid (Lumbriculus variegatus). Among them, R. komarovi and Tubificidae gen. sp. were restricted to the profundal zone during the summer stratified season, while they were found at littoral bottoms in winter. suggesting that their bathymetric distributions are regulated by water temperature regime and change seasonally. R. komarovi, a primarily riverine tubificid, which was previously known only from Primor'e (Russia) and it is fully described and illustrated in this article, dominated at the profundal bottoms. The cool, oxygen-rich environment at the profundal bottoms of the lake allowed colonization by stenotherm and oxyphilic species. Descriptions and taxonomic remarks are provided for two naidids new to Japan., Amphichaeta leydigii and Pristinella amphibiotica, based on L.

It describes a study held over a hydrological and diurnal period, which enabled to map the variability of several physico-chemical variables due to regional climate and to compare the results with the TSI in winter and summer. The thermal behavior of the water column is typical of a polymictic reservoir. Low dissolved oxygen levels have been measured, reaching 0.07 mg L-1 in the deepest part of the reservoir as a direct consequence of the increased nutrient levels. The average pH was slightly acid (6.71) especially at the reservoir bottom and did not show significant changes during the monitoring period. The electrical conductivity varied according to seasons, i.e., it was higher in the rainy period compared to dry season, averaging 138 and 84.06 mu S/cm, respectively. According to the TSI, the reservoir has been classified as mesotrophic and eutrophic in the dry and rainy season, respectively.

Indeed, when the water-level is low, during the autumn, the contact between the predator and the prey is more frequent, and the predation increases. Conversely, when the water-level is high, in the spring, it is more difficult for the predator to find a prey and the predation decreases. In this paper, we consider a seasonally varying predator-prey model to study the influence of water-level variations on the interaction between two species of fishes in an artificial lake. A seasonal variation of the water-level is introduced in the predation rate. The predator population is provided some additional food apart from the focal prey, and follows logistic growth in the absence of prey population. As control upon the over predation, the predator population is harvested. Sensitivity analysis shows that the biomass of predator population is highly sensitive to the additional food and water variations. In the absence of additional food, our results show bursting patterns of fishes whereas positive periodic solution arises if the additional food is available in sufficient amount. The positive periodic solution is shown to be globally stable. Higher values of water-level fluctuations induce double periodic oscillations. Our findings show that providing additional food source to the generalist predator together with water-level fluctuations exerts a strong influence on the interaction between fishes.

The present study was conducted to record the water bird diversity with an account of heronry from March 2010 to February 2013 by applying standard methods. During the study period, a total of 95 water bird species belonging to 22 families were recorded. Family Anatidae dominated the list by 18 species, followed by Scolopacidae (13 species) and Ardeidae (11 species). A total of 45 species recorded as resident, 43 species as winter migrant and 7 species as summer migrant. The relative abundance analysis showed that, 41% bird species were common, 40% occasional and 19% were uncommon in the study area. Month-wise, January recorded maximum number of species and individual while February recorded maximum density and Common Teal witnessed maximum count during the study period. Winter season and third year of study (2012-13) recorded maximum number of species, abundance and density. Among five ecological categories, maximum richness of small waders (34%) was recorded. TWINSPAN and Cluster analysis identified four dominant bird communities in the study area. The heronry revealed 18 bird species nesting in Phoenix sylvestris and Prosopis juliflora trees, with maximum number of nests observed of Asian Openbill, Black-crowned Night Heron and Black-headed Ibis recorded from April to September. IUCN listed 2 species as Vulnerable, 6 species under Near Threatened and rest species under Least Concern category. The conservation and management implications are discussed in light of results.																			0367-8318					DEC	2017	87	12					1504	1512																WOS:000418276900014

The nutrient status and phytoplankton were typical of a lowland eutrophic lake; this was reflected in the composition of the zooplankton. At any given time, the latter comprised 1 or 2 cladoceran and 2 or 3 copepod species, of which the cladocerans were generally numerically predominant. Marked alterations in the zooplankton community occurred in the first 2 yr of the study and were related to changes in predation pressure by fish. By the end of the 3rd yr, the composition of the zooplankton community had stabilized. The cladoceran biomass was normally in excess of that of the copepods, with maxima in spring and autumn. Peaks in copepod biomass occurred within 2 mo. of those of the Cladocera.

This study applied 3S technology, landscape ecology, and computational models to investigate impact of the TGD on downstream spatial dynamics of floodplains in future. Results revealed the relationship between siltation patterns and wetland types transformation after the operation of the TGD, which are critically important to understand ecological characters dynamics in new environmental setting, and provide science-based conservation and restoration recommendation. After the operation of the TGD, changes between water surface and floodplains areas were spatial heterogeneity. With the increase of distance to the TGD, floodplain erosion force declining gradually. The most important finding is the asymmetric erosion between main river course and its associated floodplain lakes, e.g., Dongting lake. This has significant implications for dam operation in autumn and habitat management. After the operation of the TGD, floodplain in the estuary is driven by both the Yangtze river and ocean currents. The strong hydrological force and reduced sediments of Yangtze river drive erosion of the southern river course in the estuary, whereas, the weakened hydrological force in the northern river course attracts sedimentation.

J	Jaani, A				Jaani, A			Hydrology and water balance of Lake Peipsi	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lake Peipsi is a large (3558 km(2))but shallow (up to 15.3 m deep) tripartite waterbody hydrologically investigated already since the 19th century. Surface discharge by rivers accounts for more than 80% of its water balance. The residental time of water is about two years in the whole lake but several times less in its shallower southern parts receiving the biggest rivers. The annual water regime is characterized by the highest water in spring, the average amplitude of yearly level fluctuations being 1.15 m. There are known long-term hydrological cycles of 80-90, about 22, 9-11, and even fewer years. Several temporary wind-dependent circular currents exist in the subsurface layers. Alternating transitional currents occur in the narrowest part of the lake. Five different periods are distinguishable in the annual thermic cycle. The duration of the stable ice cover is up to five months (December-April) in the shallower parts but a shorter time in the centre of the lake. The maximum surface temperature in July usually reaches 21-22 degrees C in the open regions but considerably higher (up to 27-28 degrees C in some years) on shallows. The unstable summer stratification is often disturbed by waves and currents. Biological summer, with surface temperatures over 10 degrees C, lasts on an average 134 days.																			0018-8158					NOV 8	1996	338	1-3					11	23		10.1007/BF00031707	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00031707													WOS:A1996WC58000003
J	Rouse, WR				Rouse, WR			The energy and water balance of high-latitude wetlands: controls and extrapolation	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												This paper examines, with examples, controls on the energy and water balance of northern wetlands. Most wetlands have organic soils and are thus peatlands. High-latitude wetlands are underlain by ice-rich permafrost, which helps maintain wetland systems and also imparts special characteristics to their energy and water balances. In North America, components of the radiation balance decrease linearly poleward, whereas the poleward rate of decrease of temperature and precipitation lessens. During the four-month summer of a high subarctic wetland, net radiation is large and the latent heat nux dominates the energy cycle. The ground heat flux is substantial, especially in early summer, when the ice-rich ground is rapidly thawing. Winter begins in October and heat loss from the ground approximately balances negative net radiation. The summer energy and water balance differs among ten;ain units. Large shallow lakes exhibit larger net radiation and potential evaporation rates than surrounding wetland surfaces which, in turn, exhibit substantially larger magnitudes than dryland terrain. There is a variable withdrawal rate of soil moisture depending on soil types and plant rooting characteristics, which influences the actual evaporation from the surface. Synoptic weather systems play a major role in day-to-day energy and water responses to climate forcing. Long-term modelling of the water balance of a wetland shows year-to-year persistence in climatic patterns. Although net radiation, temperature and precipitation all influence the magnitudes of water deficit, the precipitation inputs are of paramount importance. Our ability to fully understand, model and extrapolate, in space and time, the major controls on the surface climate of wetlands, is evaluated. Spatial extrapolation is seen to be more readily achieved than temporal extrapolation.																			1354-1013	1365-2486				DEC	2000	6			1			59	68		10.1046/j.1365-2486.2000.06013.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2486.2000.06013.x								35026935					WOS:000166799900005

Dynamics of dissolved Fe content in tributaries of Lake Teletskoe, depending on solar activity indicators	BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING												Relevance. The need to expand and deepen the understanding of the influence of solar radiation indicators on chemical characteristics of surface water, since the dependence of hydrochemical processes on periodic changes in solar activity has so far been studied extremely poorly. In addition, special attention is paid worldwide to the study of iron content in waters of rivers and lakes. Iron increased concentrations are one of the reasons for the "brownification" of surface waters in a significant part of the Northern Hemisphere. Aim. To establish relationship between iron content and dynamics in the waters of the tributaries of Lake Teletskoe with indicators of solar activity (sunspots number, F-index). Methods. Water samples from the tributaries of Lake Teletskoe were collected into clean new polyethylene bottles in the estuaries of the rivers, from a depth of 0.5 m during the spring-summer high water and autumn low water, in 2016-2020. Content of total and dissolved Fe in the waters was determined by the ICP-MS method and by the AAS method. We used the data on solar activity indicators from the Belgian Observatory, which are freely available. Results. The total Fe content in the rivers of Lake Teletskoe basin for the period from 2016 to 2020 changes from 5 to 340 mu g/l. Concentrations of dissolved iron (from 4 to 200 mu g/l) do not exceed Russian standards, but they are often noticeably higher than the global average for river waters established abroad. The highest iron content, as well as the proportion of its soluble forms in the tributaries of Lake Teletskoe and in lake waters, was noted in 2016. It is probably due to the highest rates of solar activity. They cause certain changes in the environment - such as an increase in air temperature and water evaporation, and decrease in river flow, which accompanied by growth in concentrations of chemical elements in surface waters. Since 2016, there has been a steady decrease in dissolved iron concentration in surface natural waters of Lake Teletskoe basin, which may be a consequence of a decrease in solar radiation intensity in recent years.

Large-sized ciliates (>50 mum), such as Hypotrichia sp., Phascolodon vorticella, and Codonella cratera co-dominated with solitary phytoplankton like Stephanodiscus sp. and Cryptomonas ovata in winter and spring. Particularly, the abundance of Phascolodon vorticella was correlated with the abundance of Stephanodiscus sp. (r=0.85, p<0.0001), its apparently preferred prey. Food prey preference of Phascolodon vorticella was significantly higher for Stephanodiscus sp. (r=0.85, p<0.001) than for Cyclotella sp. (r=-0.14, p>0.318), which are similar in structure but different in size. Small-sized ciliates (<30 μm) mostly comprised Vorticella spp., Rimostrombidium hyvalinum, and Halteria spp. and co-occurred with bacteria in warm seasons. These results suggest that the seasonal distribution of freshwater planktonic ciliates is determined by variations in their prey populations.																			0270-5060					DEC	2003	18	4					577	584		10.1080/02705060.2003.9663998	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2003.9663998													WOS:000186639400008

Abundance and toxicity of Planktothrix rubescens in the pre-alpine Lake Ammersee, Germany	HARMFUL ALGAE												Regular occurrences of the cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens have been observed in several lakes that have undergone recent re-oligotrophication, e.g. Lake Ammersee. Planktothrix species are known to produce microcystins, potent phosphatase inhibitors that have been associated with morbidities and mortalities in humans and animals. The aim of this study was to characterise the temporal and spatial abundance and toxicity of P. tubescens in Lake Ammersee. P. rubescens cell densities and biovolumes were calculated via fluorescence image analyses. P. rubescens was present during the entire observation period from 1999 to 2004, albeit at different cell densities. Maximum biovolumes of 45 cm(3) m(-2) were observed in May 2001. Filaments were regularly distributed over the entire water column during winter and stratified in distinct metalimnic layers during summer, reaching maximum cell densities of <= 15,000 (winter) and <= 77,000 cells ml(-1) (summer). The results demonstrate that P. rubescens abundance is strongly influenced by water transparency, i.e. illumination in the metalimnion. Moreover, the P. rubescens abundance appears to result from regular phosphate depletion in the epilimnion, possibly additionally benefiting from high nitrogen loads. Microcystin (MC) was detectable in 27 and 38 of 54 seston samples via HPLC and Adda-ELISA measurements, respectively. The main microcystin congeners in the seston samples were [Asp(3)]-MC-RR and [Asp(3),Dhb(7)]-MC-RR. Microcystin concentrations correlated significantly with the respective phycoerythrin (PE)-concentrations. The variation in the MC/PE-ratios was low suggesting that the microcystin production of P. rubescens in Lake Ammersee is consistent and indicates that the appearance of P. rubescens coincides with measurable microcystin levels. Moreover, the observation of pronounced metalimnic oxygen depletions appears to be causally related to recurring high P. rubescens abundance. In conclusion the results suggest that aquatic organisms such as indigenous fish populations (e.g. coregonids) are regularly confronted with potentially adverse P. rubescens densities, which might provide a possible explanation for the often observed impaired health and growth retardation of coregonid populations in P. rubescens containing pre-alpine lakes.

The highest release rates (up to 4 mg P m-2 d-1) were found in August and the lowest (0.2 mg P m-2 d-1) in winter. Temperature was found to be the most important factor controlling release; only temperatures above 13.degree. C allowed released in summer. An infiltration rate of 10 mm d-1 suppressed the P-release effectively. A pH of 9.5 instead of 8.2 in the overlying water had only a minor effect on release rates. Release rates based on preliminary phosphorus budget calculated for 1984 and those measured in the laboratory were comparable. A conceptual model based upon mineralization and precipitation processes was employed to explain the results obtained. The observed influences of temperature, infiltration and pH of the water column were explained qualitatively by the model. An effect of changes in oxygen penetration depth on phosphorus release rates cannot be excluded.																			0043-1354	1879-2448				MAR	1988	22	3					355	363		10.1016/S0043-1354(88)90240-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0043-1354(88)90240-0													WOS:A1988M952200012

The present study evaluated the potential association between muscle tissue contaminant (total Hg and total PCB) concentrations and indicators of health in benthic and predatory fish collected from four Forest Preserves of Cook County lakes in the Chicago metropolitan area. Common carp (carp; Cyprinus carpio) and largemouth bass (LMB; Micropterus salmoides) were sampled three times a year (spring, summer, fall) during 2019 and 2020. Water quality analyses (temperature, color, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, total alkalinity, pH, chloride, nitrate, phosphate, ammonium, and pH) were performed concurrently with fish collections. Tissue (skin-on fillet) contaminant concentrations were compared between lake types and fish species and assessed for any relationship with fish morphometric data and pathologic lesions. Main health indicator endpoints included muscle lipid content, parasite burden, and pathologic lesions. Mean total PCB concentrations were greater in carp (203.1 +/- 152 mu g/kg, wet weight), and mean Hg concentrations were greater in LMB (0.11 +/- 0.1 mg/kg, wet weight). In most fish, concentrations of both toxicants surpassed the EPA's lowest threshold to restrict fish consumption for sensitive cohorts (0.029 mg/kg for Hg and 1.5 mu g/kg for PCBs). In both species, Hg positively correlated with splenic pigmented macrophage aggregate area (P < 0.001). In carp, Hg also positively correlated with hepatocellular pigmentation (P < 0.01). Mercury correlated with standard length in both species (LMB: P < 0.001, carp: P = 0.95), but polychlorinated biphenyls only correlated with standard length in carp (P < 0.001). No association was found between intraspecific contaminant concentrations and parasite burden, year, or lake type, though differences were noted among individual lakes. The contaminant burden appeared well-tolerated with only mild Hg-associated and no appreciable PCB-associated lesions. However, possible effects on reproduction or behavior were not fully assessed, and future studies are warranted.																			0166-445X	1879-1514				JAN	2022	242								106043	10.1016/j.aquatox.2021.106043	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2021.106043								34902739					WOS:000765515700002
J	Schulz, M; Bischoff, M				Schulz, Marcus; Bischoff, Maik			Variation in riverine phosphorus between 1994 and 2003 as affected by land-use and loading reductions in six medium-sized to large German rivers	LIMNOLOGICA												Land use and in-stream transformation exert great influence on concentrations and loads of phosphorus (P) in rivers. We aimed to display differences in the courses of total P (TP) and soluble reactive P (SRP) concentrations and loads in six medium-sized to large rivers in the central region of Germany, and to identify the reasons for different long-term trends. Therefore, we applied multivariate statistics to 10-year-time series (1994-2003) of TP, SRP, discharge (Q), water temperature (T), pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved oxygen (DO), total iron (Fe), and total manganese (Mn). Statistical results were related to land use in the catchments of the rivers. TP concentrations ranged between 0.02 and 0.78 mg l(-1), and SRP concentrations ranged between 0.01 and 0.44 mg l(-1). Q correlated negatively with TP and SRP concentrations over the entire year. Furthermore, Fe correlated significantly and positively to TP and SRP and therefore, ferric hydroxides likely were the major P sorption sites. DOC showed significant positive correlation to SRP particularly in spring, indicating manure exposure in early spring as a major source of both, DOC and SRP. Significant negative correlations between DO and SRP in summer hint at internal P loading in rivers or in flushed lakes. Different forms of land use were the reasons of enhanced or retarded recovering from previous increases in P concentrations. High portions of arable land within some of the catchments impeded the process of decreases since 1996 because of remaining high-diffuse emissions from fertilized soils. Agricultural practices, exposing fertilizer to soils within the river catchments and high Q in early spring caused high TP and SRP loads to downstream systems, and evoked risks for downstream river reaches.

J	Ferencz, B; Dawidek, J				Ferencz, Beata; Dawidek, Jarosaw			The variability of conditions of carbonate allocation on the example of a small flow-through AA™czna-Wodawa lake (Eastern Poland)	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												A synthetic index LSI (Langelier Saturation Index) was calculated to analyze conditions of carbonates allocation. The higher LSI value, positive or negative, the better conditions to deposition or chemical denudation, respectively. Physical-chemical research was carried out in the lake-catchment system of Lake SyczyA"skie, located in the border zone of Polish Lowland and Lublin Upland. The data were collected during the three water years 2007-2009. A hydro-chemical state of products of CaCO3 dissociation in waters was close to the equilibrium for most of the year. Values of the LSI ranged from -0.08 to 1.44 in the water of the catchment under study. The highest LSI values were observed in the lake water. The lowest LSI values occurred in waters of the inlet originated from a Cretaceous spring. Allocation conditions were established along inlet-lake-outlet transect. A decrease of carbonates translocation along the transect was typical for the Lake SyczyA"skie and it occurred in all seasons. A clear seasonality of the carbonate equilibrium state was observed in the lake-catchment system under study. Results showed that inlet of groundwater determined transport of products of calcium and magnesium carbonate dissociation in the catchment Lake SyczyA"skie. The most stable chemical conditions were observed in winter, which resulted from an intense groundwater inflow. The least stable conditions occurred in spring, in which season conditions of carbonates allocations were modified by precipitation and/or surface runoff.					; Ferencz, Beata/AFQ-7259-2022	Ferencz, Beata/0000-0001-9003-7517; Dawidek, Jaroslaw/0000-0001-9335-4614													1866-6280	1866-6299				FEB	2015	73	4					1601	1610		10.1007/s12665-014-3510-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-014-3510-4													WOS:000348439000016

Water samples were collected monthly at five stations and the yeasts were isolated at 25 degrees C on Sabourad dextrose agar supplemented with 0.5% of yeast extract and 10 mg% of chloramphenicol. August and February showed the highest numbers of isolates, coinciding, respectively with the beginning and the ending of stratification. Of 56 isolated species, Aureobasidium pullulans, Candida famata, Cryptococcus albidus, Cryptococcus laurentii, Rhodotorula glutinis, Rhodotorula rubra and Trichosporon cutaneum occurred at the highest frequencies. A. pullulans showed greatest prevalence during the dry period (winter), whereas C. famata, Cr albidus, Cr laurentii and Rh. rubra were prevalent during the rainy season (summer). Tr. cutaneum was distributed between July and November. Most isolates yeasts are associated with plants and soils, and are important in decomposition of aquatic macrophytes. Furthermore, a possible role of these species as indicators of pollution is discussed.					; Barbosa, Francisco/M-6225-2019; Morais, Paula/E-9794-2013	Barbosa, Francisco Antonio/0000-0002-2026-6936; Resende Stoianoff, Maria Aparecida/0000-0002-6220-1321; Rosa, Carlos/0000-0002-0056-9075; Morais, Paula/0000-0002-5050-5766													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL 21	1995	308	2					103	108		10.1007/BF00007394	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007394													WOS:A1995TA02200002

Landslides in permafrost area are characterised by frozen bottom of sliding and known as thaw slumps or mudslides. Landslide body consists of frozen soils, which thaws and forms thermo cirques and depressions. Long warm summers and snowy winters of last decade trigger cryogenic landslides over Siberia. The situation with existing linear infrastructure (roads, railways and pipelines) is changing due to permafrost thawing that has not been taken into account during design 5-30 years ago. Apart from deformations to infrastructure cryogenic landslides provoke gas release from permafrost, change of water content in lakes and rivers, and disturbance of lands (tundra and taiga) for rendering. Diversity of landslides in permafrost area and nine study cases are presented in this paper. The mitigation measures are not applicable for cryogenic landslides at high rates. There is a call for innovative solutions in this area.																			1878-9897	2213-6959	978-3-319-77377-3; 978-3-319-77376-6				2019	50						303	313		10.1007/978-3-319-77377-3_14	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-77377-3_14	10.1007/978-3-319-77377-3												WOS:000466559900016

To assess the biophysical factors affecting permafrost dynamics, we monitored permafrost and ecological conditions in central Alaska from 2005 to 2021 by measuring weather, land cover, topography, thaw depths, hydrology, soil properties, soil thermal regimes, and vegetation cover between burned (1990 fire) and unburned terrain. Climate data show large variations among years with occasional, extremely warm-wet summers and cold-snowless winters that affect permafrost stability. Microtopography and thaw depth surveys revealed both permafrost degradation and aggradation. Thaw depths were deeper in post-fire scrub compared to unburned black spruce and increased moderately during the last year, but analysis of historical imagery (1954-2019) revealed no increase in thermokarst rates due to fire. Recent permafrost formation was observed in older bogs due to an extremely cold-snowless winter in 2007. Soil sampling found peat extended to depths of 1.5-2.8 m with basal radiocarbon dates of similar to 5-7 ka bp, newly accumulating post-thermokarst peat, and evidence of repeated episodes of permafrost formation and degradation. Soil surface temperatures in post-fire scrub bogs were similar to 1 degrees C warmer than in undisturbed black spruce bogs, and thermokarst bogs and lakes were 3-5 degrees C warmer than black spruce bogs. Vegetation showed modest change after fire and large transformations after thermokarst. We conclude that extreme seasonal weather, ecological succession, fire, and a legacy of earlier geomorphic processes all affect the repeated formation and degradation of permafrost, and thus create a highly patchy mosaic of ecotypes resulting from widely varying ecological trajectories within boreal peatland ecosystems.

Salicaceae afforestations: advantage or disadvantage for Neotropical otter in its southernmost distribution?	HYSTRIX-ITALIAN JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY												Anthropogenic environmental changes may affect habitat suitability for wildlife. Currently, the commercial plantation of non-native trees is one of the most important types of land-use worldwide. The Lower Parana River Delta in Argentina is a macromosaic of wetlands of high biodiversity value, which has been modified by the afforestation with Salicaceae species. In this context, the Neotropical otter, Lontra longicaudis (classified as Near Threatened at world level and as Endangered in Argentina), faces new challenges related to the colonization of these afforestation landscapes. On this basis, we investigated whether these human-made habitats could be a suitable habitat for the Neotropical otter. We analyzed habitat use and selection by this species at two scales of perception (micro- and macrohabitat) and in two contrasting seasons (winter and summer). Our results show that drainage channels within the afforestation landscape provide suitable conditions for this species during winter. The most important variables at macrohabitat level (dissolved oxygen, pH, and electric conductivity) and seasonally (temperature and pH) appeared to be related to prey availability in the watercourse stretches. At the microhabitat level, the primary factor for distinguishing between used and available sites was soil hardness, possibly related to favorable edaphic conditions for digging burrows. Therefore, the survival of this species in the area will depend on the afforestation management, mainly on those actions that decrease dissolved oxygen levels of waters and increase soil hardness of banks. Under the current wetland loss scenario in the region, afforestation systems may contribute to the conservation of this species.																			0394-1914	1825-5272					2019	30	2					166	171		10.4404/hystrix-00232-2019	http://dx.doi.org/10.4404/hystrix-00232-2019													WOS:000529056600010

In the summer and fall of 2018, two critical, 252- inch diameter flexible steel pipelines were dewatered for condition assessments after more than 15 years without an outage. These pipelines convey over 2 billion gallons of water each day, making opportunities for inspection rare and difficult to schedule. Crews must work around the clock during an outage to dewater, inspect, repair, and rewater to quickly put the system back in operation. This paper will present the highlights and challenges of these recent pipeline inspections performed by CAP and Bureau of Reclamation engineers including outage planning, dewatering, inspection procedures, results, and recommendations.																					978-0-7844-8248-3				2019							69	79																WOS:000494638100008

We compared proxy records with the results from a transient simulation performed using the Kiel Climate Model forced by orbital variations, to analyse summer precipitation changes in this area during the Holocene (9.5-0 ka BP). The model results suggested increasing amounts of summer precipitation from 9.5 to similar to 6.2 ka BP and a persistent decline thereafter, which matched well with pollen records but was inconsistent with ostracod delta O-18 records. The Holocene climatic optimum lagged the Northern Hemisphere summer insolation maximum by similar to 3.5 ka, caused by the interplay between the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) circulation and the mid-latitude westerlies. The ostracod delta O-18 values reflected the strength of the EASM circulation. A strong EASM circulation increased the transport of water vapour towards the northeastern Tibetan Plateau from the northwestern Pacific. Weakened mid-latitude westerlies increased the incursion of cold air masses into the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. During the early Holocene, relatively strong mid-latitude westerlies, resulting from an enhanced Arctic Oscillation, reduced summer precipitation on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, in spite of a strong insolation-driven EASM circulation. The weakening EASM circulation and the strengthening westerlies together induced the decreasing trend of summer precipitation from the middle to late Holocene. In addition, summer precipitation variations were further modulated by sea-surface temperatures in the northwestern Pacific, through weakening the strength of the EASM.

The research and field observations consisted in daily precipitation sums measurement and water levels measurement in Mala Welna river up to Kiszkowo cross-section, monthly hydrometric measurement in five cross-section along the river flow as well as monthly measurement of water levels in Owieczki, Kleckie and Gorzuchowskie lakes. The measurement of water flow rate was made In order to evaluate an ability of two biggest lakes to compensate river outflow. Variability of water levels in Kleckie and Gorzuchowskie Lake indicates periodical seasonality determined by meteorological conditions, which was confirmed by analysis of relationship between precipitation and water levels. The highest water levels were observed during spring thaw, the lowest in the autumn. Average amplitude of water levels was 65 cm in Kleckie Lake and 54 cm in Gorzuchowskie Lake. The lakes through which Mala Welna flows cause river Outflow compensation. It was indicated that average ability of outflow compensation from Kleckie Lake is about 9,8% and 2,7% from Gorzuchowskie lake. Kleckie Lake is of average regime but because of water lifting devices located after the lake, it may have active as well as passive regime in dry hydrological years, whereas Gorzuchowskie lakes has passive regime.

Effects of Wind and Buoyancy on Carbon Dioxide Distribution and Air-Water Flux of a Stratified Temperate Lake	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Improved calculations of emissions of greenhouse gases from stratified lakes require understanding the physical processes controlling transport of dissolved gases to the air-water interface on diel, synoptic, and seasonal time scales. We address this issue during the transition from late summer to autumn cooling in a small temperate lake by combining micrometeorology, physical limnology, and carbon dioxide (CO2) measurements throughout the water column. Over the 26-day campaign, the lake cooled and emitted CO2 with daily average loss of 23 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1). Over diel cycles, lake surface pCO(2) decreased during daytime heating and increased during nighttime cooling, while daytime CO2 fluxes exceeded nighttime fluxes by 35% due to higher daytime wind speeds. We compared the effects of diel and synoptic weather patterns on the CO2 distribution within the lake and lake-atmosphere CO2 flux. Increases in near-surface pCO(2) scaled with stratification and heat loss which moderated transport of dissolved gases into the mixed layer. When winds were above similar to 4 m s(-1), lake-scale circulations drove upwelling and downwelling that redistributed heat and carbon dioxide between the northeast and southwest basins. Short-burst peak CO2 fluxes exceeded 50 mmol m(-2) d(-1) during windy periods associated with storms. However, the seasonal cooling-induced transition to persistent deep mixing led to the highest CO2 concentrations in the mixed layer and at the surface and the highest sustained CO2 fluxes (approaching 100 mmol m(-2) d(-1)).

Atmospheric deposition of Ca averaged 40 mmol m(-2) yr(-1), and it showed a seasonal pattern similar to that reported for Saharan dust export to the Mediterranean region, with maxima during spring and summer. Ca enrichment from nonmarine sources was significantly related to the TOMS (Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer) aerosol index. Atmospheric inputs significantly affected Ca concentration of the selected lakes, which do not presumably receive significant Ca inputs from weathering. The intensity of the effect depended on their corresponding sensitivities to evaporation. Total atmospheric inputs of Ca to each study lake catchment (11300 and 3100 moles) were enough to explain the lake Ca content (5400 and 111 moles, respectively). The results obtained in this study reveal that atmospheric inputs, particularly Saharan dust deposition, may be a significant source of calcium to remote mountain lakes.					; Reche, Isabel/K-7120-2014	Pulido, Elvira/0000-0002-5436-2133; Reche, Isabel/0000-0003-2908-1724; Morales Baquero, Rafael/0000-0002-7075-7899													0886-6236	1944-9224				JUN 2	2006	20	2							GB2012	10.1029/2005GB002662	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2005GB002662													WOS:000238070100001

They thus serve as good natural laboratories to study abiotic and biotic factors controlling the precipitation of different carbonate minerals and CaCO3 polymorphism. Through tens of years' investigations on travertines, considerable advances about carbonate mineral precipitation have been made. Here, we summarized general hydrological features of travertine systems, and driving forces, microenvironments, and mechanisms of the precipitation of different carbonate minerals in travertine-depositing hot springs by integrating present advances and conducting hydrochemical simulations. Travertine-depositing hot springs can be divided into near-neutral pH hot springs and hyperalkaline hot springs and contain four types of microenvironments: hypogean solid-water interface, epigean solid-water interface, air-water interface, and subaerial exposure surface. Both abiotic (passive CO2 degassing, atmospheric CO2 uptake, evaporation, and fluid mixing) and biotic (metabolism, organism-related crystal nucleation, and trapping and binding) processes may drive carbonate formation. The specific driving forces, however, depend on bulk water hydrochemistry and microenvironments. Calcite and aragonite are the most common minerals in travertines and the calcite-aragonite polymorphism might be under decisive influences from bulk water chemistry, especially [Mg-2(+)]/[Ca-2(+)], in some conditions. However, calcium carbonate precipitation in hot springs is controlled by solute transport in microenvironments, and any local change induced by hydrodynamics, microorganisms, and extracellular polymeric substances may significantly modify CaCO3 precipitation and polymorphism. Such integrated control from bulk water composition and microenvironments also affects the formation of other carbonate minerals, but their exact roles remain unclear. Overall, despite the fruitful recent findings, further investigations, especially those focusing on microenvironments, are still imperative to better understand carbonate precipitation in hot springs. These microenvironment-scale studies might also provide insights on carbonate precipitation in other environments. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An increase in the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the deep water during winter 1988-1989 indicates that 30-45% of deep water was replaced with well-oxygenated surface water. This deep-water renewal corresponds to a mean deep water residence time of 2-4 yr. The deep-water oxygen consumption rate is 21-26 mu mol m(-3) d(-1), which occurs primarily through the oxidation of organic matter and, to a lesser extent, the oxidation of reduced inorganic species that are introduced to the lake via subsurface hydrothermal springs.

J	SPAAK, P				SPAAK, P			SEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN DAPHNIA - INTERSPECIFIC DIFFERENCES IN A HYBRID SPECIES COMPLEX	OECOLOGIA												To investigate whether reproductive variation in the Daphnia galeata-cucullata-hyalina hybrid species complex can explain the occurrence of hybrids and backcrosses, a total of 43 clones from three north German lakes were tested for allocation to sexual reproduction under equal stress conditions. Six replicates per clone were followed until the seventh adult instar. I used the following cues to promote sexual reproduction: short photoperiod, water from a crowded Daphnia culture, fish-conditioned water and low food concentration. For each animal, clutch size and clutch sex were recorded. Ephippia, which were empty since the animals were cultured individually, were only produced by D. cucullata and D. cucullata x hyalina (26% and 6% of the broods, respectively), whereas almost all taxa produced males (the range was 2-15%). Intraspecific variation for male and ephippial production was also found. The fact that the taxa tested show different responses to the stimuli offered may indicate that there is reproductive isolation between them. This is supported by field data from the Tjeukemeer (The Netherlands) which shows that D. galeata mostly produces ephippia in spring and D. cucullata in autumn. The presence of hybrids with ephippia in both seasons, however, shows that backcrossing is also possible.																			0029-8549					DEC	1995	104	4					501	507		10.1007/BF00341348	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00341348								28307666					WOS:A1995TJ37500013
J	HAYNES, JM; NETTLES, DC				HAYNES, JM; NETTLES, DC			FALL MOVEMENTS OF BROWN TROUT IN LAKE-ONTARIO AND A TRIBUTARY	NEW YORK FISH AND GAME JOURNAL												Movements of radio-tagged brown trout during pre-spawning, spawning and post-spawning periods were studied in Lake Ontario and Sandy Creek in Monroe County (New York, USA from Sept.-Nov. 1980. Most of the tagged trout moved eastward in the lake after leaving Sandy Creek, but most of them eventually returned westward. Several made extensive east-west movements in Lake Ontario, but none ascended Sandy Creek farther than 2 km. Until mid-Oct., most of the radio-tagged brown trout remained offshore in deep water during the day and moved inshore to shallow water at night. Water temperatures where fish with temperature-sensing transmitters were located generally corresponded to surface temperatures in shallow areas and averaged 11.5.degree. C., well within the 10.degree.-15.degree. C. preference range of the species. As surface-water temperatures declined in late autumn, brown trout moved to deeper water where the temperature, although averaging 4.degree. C., was warmer than that at the surface. During storms, the trout generally moved offshore to deeper waters or may have left the study area.																			0028-7210						1983	30	1					39	56																WOS:A1983RE44100004

At one of these lakes, Great Salt Lake (GSL), Utah, a commercial harvest of brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana Kellogg, 1906) cysts occurs during fall and may impact Eared Grebe populations. We used photo surveys on the other hypersaline lake, Mono Lake, California, and on the GSL, as well as aerial counts on the GSL, to describe population fluctuations of Eared Grebes staging on these lakes. The long-term (1997-2012) Eared Grebe population was 1.4 million on the GSL and 1.0 million on Mono Lake. Populations changed on GSL and Mono Lake in synchrony, indicating population regulation is likely occurring at wintering, not staging, areas and is influenced by El Nino effects. Location of Eared Grebes on the GSL was influenced by brine shrimp densities and did not overlap with concentrations of commercial harvest boats. Spatial segregation of commercial harvesters and Eared Grebes reduces negative impacts of anthropogenic disturbance on Eared Grebes. Knowledge of population changes within and among staging areas will help managers monitor long-term abundances and reduce negative impacts between Eared Grebes and commercial harvesters.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				DEC	2013	91	12					906	913		10.1139/cjz-2013-0181	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2013-0181													WOS:000328273600009
J	Chowdhury, MR; Wells, MG; Howell, T				Chowdhury, Mijanur R.; Wells, Mathew G.; Howell, Todd			Movements of the thermocline lead to high variability in benthic mixing in the nearshore of a large lake	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The thermocline of Lake Ontario is in constant motion, and as it washes back and forth along the sloping lakebed there is a striking asymmetry in near-bed stratification and benthic turbulence between its rise and fall. Detailed field observations of the stratification and water currents from the summers of 2012 and 2013 showed that the thermocline motions had large amplitudes (as high as 15 m) and a dominant period between 16 and 17.5 h, corresponding to a near -inertial internal Poincare wave. During the falling phase, the warmer down-slope flow was strongly stratified with near -bed water temperature gradients of m(-1). In contrast during the rising phase of colder up-slope flow, there was an unstable stratification in near -bed water and large temperature overturns due to the differential advection of stratified waters, i.e., the shear -driven convective mechanism. Using a Thorpe-scale analysis of overturns, the inferred turbulent diffusivity during the up-slope flow was ic 5 x 10-4 m(2) s l. In striking contrast during the down -slope flow, the strong stratification had lower turbulent diffusivities of KZ -10(-6) m2 s(-1). The near bottom region of Lake Ontario within the thermocline swash-zone has intense biological activity and the highest concentrations of invasive dreissenid mussels. We discuss the potential biological implications of the striking variability in benthic mixing and near -bed stratification for nutrient cycling in the Lake Ontario nearshore.					; wells, mathew/A-7101-2012	wells, mathew/0000-0003-3838-9202; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				APR	2016	52	4					3019	3039		10.1002/2015WR017725	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015WR017725													WOS:000377432800038
J	Noel, BL; Chandler, CR				Noel, Brandon L.; Chandler, C. Ray			Spatial distribution and site fidelity of non-breeding Piping Plovers on the Georgia Coast	WATERBIRDS												The Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) is a federally listed species with three distinct breeding populations, including Great Plains (threatened), Great Lakes (endangered), and Atlantic Coast (threatened), all of which winter along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States. The spatial distribution and site fidelity of wintering Piping Plovers was investigated on Little St. Simons Island (LSSI), Geogria, from 2003-2006, with emphasis on the conservation significance of this site for the endangered Greak Lakes population. Of the individually recognizable color-banded plovers observed on LSSI during 2003-2004 (N=39), 31% (N=12) were observed the following year; 69% (N=9) of plovers that wintered in 2003-2004 returned to winter in 2004-2005. Although good winter survival in 2003-2004 was estimated, survival estimates dramatically declined in 2004-2005. Even with low survival estimates for 2004-2005, 44% of these wintering individuals returned to winter in 2005-2006. Wintering plovers on LSSI were site faithful to particular sections of beaches and occupied small home-ranges. These data on site fidelity and home-range suggest that relatively small areas on LSSI may be disproportionate importance to wintering Piping Plovers. Critical habitat designations should take account of this within-island variation, and modest detection rates suggest plover numbers could be underestimated by single-visit surveys throughout their winter range.																			1524-4695					JUN	2008	31	2					241	251		10.1675/1524-4695(2008)31[241:SDASFO]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/1524-4695(2008)31[241:SDASFO]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000258481800009

Atmospheric PCBs and OCPs were mainly in gas-phase in both periods. However, their dissolved and particle-phase water concentrations were comparable. For PCBs, 3 and 4-Cl congeners were dominant while chlorpyrifos, endosulfans and HCHs were the most abundant OCPs for all samples. Especially in summer, calculated net gas-exchange PCB fluxes were mainly volatilization from the water ranging from - 0.2 (volatilization, PCB-101) to -30.0 (volatilization, PCB-31) ng m(-2) day(-1). For OCPs, net flux ranged from -0.03 (volatilization, cis-nonachlor) to 1568 (deposition, endosulfan I) ng m(-2) day(-1) and they have seasonal variations with generally deposition in winter and volatilization in summer. However, endosulfan I, II, endosulfan sulfate, alpha- and gamma-HCH deposited in both periods. The calculated residence times of PCBs and OCPs in the water column indicated that the gas-exchange in the Bay is at least as or a more important mechanism than advection. Annual gaseous absorption and volatilization fluxes were calculated and were used along with the estimated dry deposition fluxes and wet deposition fluxes measured recently at a suburban site in Izmir to determine the relative contributions of different atmospheric mechanisms to the pollutant inventory of the Bay water column. Results suggested that the relative contributions of all studied mechanisms to the water column PCB and OCP inventories were significant. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, these activities may cause contamination to critical water resources. This study investigates the impact of recreational activities on the presence and concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and ultraviolet (UV) filters in drinking water reservoirs in Southeast Queensland, Australia. Polydimethylsiloxane passive samplers were used to monitor 14 lakes over a 3-year period, focusing on seasonal variations and the influence of recreational activities such as petrol-powered boating and swimming. A total of 15 PAHs and six UV filters were detected, with chrysene (97%) and octyl salicylate (34%) being the most prevalent PAH and UV filter, respectively. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon levels were statistically significantly higher in lakes permitting petrol-powered boating, especially during summer (p = 0.005 to 0.05). Lake Maroon and Lake Moogerah were the only sites that showed significantly higher PAH levels in summer (3.9 +/- 1.1 and 4.0 +/- 1.2 ng L-1, respectively) than winter (1.6 +/- 0.61 and 1.5 +/- 0.84, respectively). Ultraviolet filters were generally detected in higher levels in lakes allowing swimming, with Lake Moogerah and Lake Sommerset measuring UV filter concentrations of 20 +/- 4.1 and 20 +/- 11 ng L-1 in summer, respectively. Other lakes that do not permit swimming, such as Lake Maroon and Lake Samsonvale, also exhibited elevated UV filter levels, suggesting illegal swimming. These findings highlight the complexity of PAH and UV filter presence, influenced by multiple factors including lake size, recreational activity type, and seasonal variations. The levels of individual PAHs and UV filters in this study were below established freshwater guidelines. However, when considering their bioaccumulation potential and mixture toxicity, mitigating the impact of these substances on our environment and the organisms within it should be of priority.

A combination of geological conditions favours their formation, including (i) the presence of karstic limestone aquifers in the limbs of anticlines cut through by fault systems; (ii) very gentle slopes from the spring resurgence point towards the centre of the alluvial plain, creating a flat waterlogged area; and (iii) a semiarid climate with marked precipitation seasonality or significant fluctuations in water discharge and wetland water table. We suggest the term "anastomosing wetlands" or "anastomosing palustrine environments" to denote the studied karstic spring-fed carbonate wetlands, because of similarities with anastomosing river systems in aerial view. The common presence of extended anastomosing wetland carbonates in the Persepolis Basin and adjacent basins in the central and southern Zagros suggests that they can play an important role in the geological records of collision-related basin-and-range settings dominated by karstic limestones. Karstic spring wetlands are a main source of fresh water hosting a rich biodiversity, which attracts human communities, whose impact is visible in the archaeological material imbedded in the wetland stratigraphy. Fresh water availability, through these spring wetlands, partly explains why the semiarid Persepolis region was selected by successive civilizations, from Elamites to Persians until early Islamic entities, to establish regional centres throughout the period from the third millennium B.C. to the first millennium A.D. Only a few of these ecosystems have survived the intensive human activities of recent decades.					; Naderi Beni, Abdolmajid/AAQ-5777-2020; Gandouin, Emmanuel/AAM-9745-2021; Pourkerman, Majid/GYJ-5455-2022; Djamali, Morteza/J-6247-2014; Mashkour, Marjan/B-5724-2018; Mashkour, Marjan/AFV-2652-2022; BRISSET, Elodie/M-9867-2013; Marriner, Nick/AAA-3004-2019	Rashidian, Elnaz/0000-0001-7117-6888; BRISSET, Elodie/0000-0001-8706-0505; NADERI BENI, ABDOLMAJID/0000-0002-0825-1539; Mashkour, Marjan/0000-0003-3630-9459; Gandouin, Emmanuel/0000-0001-6970-9630; Marriner, Nick/0000-0002-7916-6059; 													0008-4077	1480-3313				OCT	2018	55	10					1158	1172		10.1139/cjes-2018-0065	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjes-2018-0065													WOS:000449166200005
J	Wang, Y; Yamazaki, K; Fujiyoshi, Y				Wang, Yafei; Yamazaki, Koji; Fujiyoshi, Yasushi			The interaction between two separate propagations of rossby waves	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												This study deals with two teleconnection patterns and the subsequent wave train propagations during an East Asian summer. Diagnostic results are as follows: 1) a stationary wave ray with zonal wavenumber 5 approximates the arc path linking the correlation centers originating from the Caspian Sea via Lake Baikal to the sea off the southeast coast of Japan (i.e., the OKJ arc path as a focus area) in a pentad correlation map between 500-hPa geopotential height (Z500) and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) at 30 degrees N, 150 degrees E in June 1979-98. Ray tracing shows that it took 8-10 days for this stationary wave to propagate from an initial position around the Caspian Sea to the focus area, which roughly coincides with the observed case in July 1998. 2) A wave train pattern (P-Ja) observed in the boreal summer propagated along the arc line in the same way as the normal poleward Rossby wave train originating from the Philippines across the North Pacific (P-J), but with a phase shift northeastward of about 90 degrees. 3) Further correlation analyses showed that the P-J-like waves belong mainly to intraseasonal propagating ones while OKJ waves belong mainly to intraseasonal stationary ones. 4) Propagation of the newly observed wave train pattern (P-Ja) occurred following another wave train along the OKJ are path in mid-July 1998. Both northeastward and southeastward wave propagations merged off the east coast of Japan. 5) The northeastward-propagating wave train observed in mid-July 1998 was triggered by the southeastward-propagating (OKJ) wave train that produced a deep cyclonic circulation and a strong convective activity in the focus area. The link of wave forcing and deep convection was made solely because of a strong upper-level divergence in the focus area.					; Yamazaki, Koji/H-2090-2011; fujiyoshi, yasushi/P-9079-2014	Wang, Yafei/0000-0002-9866-9954; 													0027-0644	1520-0493				OCT	2007	135	10					3521	3540		10.1175/MWR3486.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/MWR3486.1													WOS:000250436800014
J	Meijer, ML; de Boois, I; Scheffer, M; Portielje, R; Hosper, H				Meijer, ML; de Boois, I; Scheffer, M; Portielje, R; Hosper, H			Biomanipulation in shallow lakes in The Netherlands: an evaluation of 18 case studies	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Conference on Trophic Interactions in Shallow Freshwater and Brackish Waterbodies	AUG 03-08, 1998	BLOSSIN, GERMANY	Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisher, Tech Univ Cottbus				Eighteen shallow lakes in The Netherlands were subjected to biomanipulation, i.e. drastic reduction of the fish stock, for the purpose of lake restoration. The morphology and the nutrient level of the lakes differed, as did the measures applied. In some lakes biomanipulation was accompanied by reduction of the phosphorus loading. In all but two lakes, the Secchi disk transparency increased after the fish removal. Eight lakes (no phosphorus loading reduction, except for one lake) showed a strong and quick response to the measures: the bottom of the lake became visible ('lake bottom view') and there was a massive development of submerged macrophytes. In eight other lakes the water transparency increased, but lake bottom view was not obtained. In the biomanipulated lakes the decrease in total phosphorus and chlorophyll a and the increase in Secchi disk transparency were significantly stronger than the general trend occurring in Dutch lakes where no measures had been taken. The improvement in the Secchi depth and chlorophyll a was also stronger than in lakes where only the phosphorus load was reduced. The critical factor for obtaining clear water was the extent of the fish reduction in winter. Significant effects were observed only after > 75% fish reduction. Success seems to require substantial fish manipulation. In such strongly biomanipulated lakes, wind resuspension of the sediment never prevented the water from becoming clear. No conclusion can be drawn with respect to the possible negative impact of cyanobacteria or Neomysis on grazing by Daphnia and consequently on water clarity. In all lakes where there had been a high density of cyanobacteria or years with a high density of Neomysis other factors such as insufficient fishery may explain why lake bottom view was not obtained. In all lakes with additional phosphorus loading reduction the fish stock has been reduced less drastically (15-60%). In these lakes the effects on transparency were less pronounced than in the lakes with > 75% fish removal. Daphnia grazing seems responsible for spring clearing in all clear lakes but one. In three lakes the reduction of benthivorous fish also increased the transparency. The factors that determine water clarity in summer are less obvious. In most clear lakes a low algal biomass coincided with a macrophyte coverage of more than 25% of the lake surface area. However, it was not clear what mechanism caused the low algal biomass in summer, although inorganic nitrogen concentrations were regularly found to be very low. Daphnia grazing in open water seemed to be of little importance for suppressing the algal biomass in summer. Although in most lakes the total phosphorus concentration decreased after the biomanipulation, the dissolved phosphorus concentration remained too high to cause phosphorus limitation of the algal growth. In four out of six clear lakes for which there are long-term data the transparency decreased again after 4 years. In one lake with lower nutrient levels the Secchi disk transparency increased over the years. However, the number of lakes with low nutrient levels is too small for conclusions to be drawn regarding the impact of nutrient levels on the stability of the clear water state.

J	Bowyer, PA				Bowyer, PA			Topographically controlled circulation and mixing in a lake	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												It is well known that the wind-driven circulation in a wide lake may be controlled by its topography. Wind stress acting on the smaller mass of the water column in the shallows results in downwind how there and return flow in the deeper water. In lakes with large areas of shallow water this circulation may cause rapid mixing in weakly stratified conditions. In more strongly stratified conditions, topographically induced horizontal wind driven circulation may influence the vertical stratification of the lake. Lough Mask is about 10 km long and has a maximum width of about 8 km. The lake may be divided into shallow eastern and deeper western portions with mean depths of 10 and 35 m respectively. In late Autumn, water at depth in the deep part of the lake moves upwind at speeds of up to 50 cm s(-1) in response to axial winds of up to 15 m s(-1) At the same location a weaker upwind how is observed in the near surface water. This return flow is topographically driven. Temperature differences between near surface and near bottom meters were small (< 0.5<degrees>C) and inversely correlated with the deep current. In a cool, windy summer, temperature time series in the deep part of the lake indicate a deep (> 20m) surface mixed layer and a cooler layer at depth whose temperature fluctuates in response to wind stress along the axis of the lake. Modelling results, supported by drogue measurements, indicate that the return how associated with axial winds in these summer conditions is confined to the surface mixed layer. If this layer is thin, shear between the surface layer and the underlying water can be sufficient to cause mixing and a thickening of the surface layer until the Richardson number is similar to 1. Thus the vertical temperature structure of the deep part of the lake can be influenced by flows driven by the lake topography. In the shallow part of the lake, there is evidence of thermally driven motion in periods of calm weather in summer.																			2169-9275	2169-9291				APR 15	2001	106	C4					7065	7080		10.1029/1999JC000149	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/1999JC000149													WOS:000168137400017
J	Liu, ZH; Liu, XL; Liao, CJ				Liu, Zaihua; Liu, Xiangling; Liao, Changjun			Daytime deposition and nighttime dissolution of calcium carbonate controlled by submerged plants in a karst spring-fed pool: insights from high time-resolution monitoring of physico-chemistry of water	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												Water temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, and specific conductivity (spc) were measured in a time interval of 15 min in a karst spring and the spring-fed pool with flourishing submerged plants in Guilin, SW China under dry weather for periods of 2 days. Measurements allowed calculation of calcium and bicarbonate concentrations ([Ca(2+)] and [HCO(3)(-)]), and thus CO(2) partial pressure (P(CO2)) and saturation index of calcite (SIc). Results show that there were not any diurnal variations in the physico-chemical parameters of the water for the spring. However, during daytime periods, pool water P(CO2) decreased to far less than the spring water in a few hours, pH and SIc increased to greater than the spring, and [Ca(2+)] and [HCO(3)(-)] decreased to less than the spring. During nighttime periods, pool water P(CO2) returned to or even increased to greater than the spring, pH and SIc decreased to less than the spring, and [Ca(2+)] and [HCO(3)(-)] increased to greater than the spring. The decrease in [Ca(2+)] and [HCO(3)(-)] to less than the spring during daytime periods implies daytime deposition of calcium carbonate, while the increase in [Ca(2+)] and [HCO(3)(-)] to greater than the spring during nighttime periods implies nighttime dissolution of calcium carbonate. The direction of the observed changes depended essentially on the illumination, indicating that daytime photosynthetic and nighttime respiratory activities in the pool aquatic plant ecosystem, which were further evidenced by the increase and decrease in DO during daytime and nighttime periods respectively, were the main processes involved. The large variations of the components of the carbonate system imply considerable changes of the capacities of CO(2) and O(2) in water. The finding has implications for water sampling strategy in slow-flowing karst streams and other similar environments with stagnant water bodies such as estuaries, lakes, reservoirs, and wetlands, where aquatic plant ecosystem may flourish.

Distributions and range expansions of rare or invasive species of planktonic calanoid copepods (Copepoda: Calanoida) within lakes and reservoirs in the continental United States	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY												A survey of lakes and reservoirs during the spring and summer of 2012 found that five species of calanoid copepods are invasive in the continental United States: Arctodiaptomus dorsalis (Marsh, 1907), Skistodiaptomus pallidus (Herrick, 1879), Eurytemora affinis (Poppe, 1880), Pseudodiaptomus forbesi (Poppe & Richard, 1890), and Sinocalanus doerri (Brehm, 1909). Two species are listed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species: Skistodiaptomus carolinensis (Yeatman, 1986) and S. sinuatus (Kincaid, 1953). Sample locations for the five invasive and two rare species are reported and compared to historical distributions. Results corroborate previous reports of range expansion for the five invasive species, indicating that these species have likely become well-established in regions into which they have recently expanded. New localities for the two rare taxa suggest a possible range expansion within the USA.

J	Toivonen, J; Fröjdö, S; Österholm, P				Toivonen, Janne; Frojdo, Soren; Osterholm, Peter			Impact of acid sulfate soil catchments on water quality in a lake in western Finland; trends and total metal load	BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Acid sulfate soils occur worldwide and can cause serious ecological damage by releasing acidity and toxic metals into watercourses. This study focused on short- and long-term changes to the water quality of a lake in western Finland. Here, a decline in water quality took place in the late 1960s. Since then, events concerning poor water quality have frequently occurred. The annual load of some potentially toxic metals varied from hundreds of kilograms to thousands of tons, depending on the metal. The proportion of low-order streams draining the nearest field to the lake is only 7% of the catchment area, while the share of the total metal load was estimated to be over 30%. This points to the importance of monitoring small coastal catchments. High runoff conditions were proven to be more important in terms of water quality than occasional summer droughts. During the past decade, acidic conditions have become more prolonged in the autumn, which is in line with a predicted scenario relating to climate change.

Mean abundance was 60,000 animals . m-2 and mean biomass was 9.9 kg fresh weight . m-2 in October 1988. More than 90 % of the standing crop were harvested by wintering waterfowl, mainly Tufted Ducks (Aythya fuligula) and Pochards (Aythya ferina). Biomass had decreased to 0.35 kg fresh weight . m-2, and abundance amounted to 5,000 m-2 in spring 1989. Thereafter the population increased by immigration of one-year old individuals (1+) and by settlement of larvae (0+) to 60,000 individuals . m-2 in October 1989, corresponding to a biomass of 6.7 kg freshweight - m-2. Both standing crop and production were dominated by the 1 + cohort. Calculated annual production was 138 g C(org) . m-2 in 1989.																			0003-9136					JUN	1993	127	4					395	407																WOS:A1993LQ08700002

Samples obtained from different water depths and at two different times of the year (in the winter during holomixis and in the early spring during a phytoplankton bloom) were analyzed. Although the lakes have the same climatic conditions and the same water source, the limnological parameters were different, as were most of the morphologically distinguishable photosynthetic bacteria enumerated by microscopy. The phylogenetic affiliations of the predominant DGGE bands were inferred by performing a comparative 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Sequences obtained from Lake Cis6 samples were related to gram-positive bacteria and to members of the division Proteobacteria. Sequences obtained from Lake Vilar samples were related to members of the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides phylum and to cyanobacteria. Thus, we found that like the previously reported differences between morphologically distinct inhabitants of the two lakes, there were also differences among the community members whose morphologies did not differ conspicuously. The changes in the species composition from winter to spring were also marked. The two lakes both contained sequences belonging to phototrophic green sulfur bacteria, which is consistent with microscopic observations, but these sequences were different from the sequences of cultured strains previously isolated from the lakes. Euryarchaeal sequences (i.e., methanogen- and thermoplasma-related sequences) also were present in both lakes. These euryarchaeal group sequences dominated the archaeal sequences in Lake Cis6 but not in Lake Vilar. In Lake Vilar, a new planktonic population related to the crenarchaeota produced the dominant archaeal band. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that new bacterial and archaeal lineages were present and that the microbial diversity of these assemblages was greater than previously known. We evaluated the correspondence between the abundances of several morphotypes and DGGE bands by comparing microscopy and sequencing results. Our data provide evidence that the sequences obtained from the DGGE fingerprints correspond to the microorganisms that are actually present at higher concentrations in the natural system.

NH4+ accumulated in the hypolimnion throughout the period of stratification and provided an overall measure of organic matter mineralization. Anaerobic metabolism, particularly methanogenesis, predominated because anoxia was total within less than 2 mo of spring water column turnover and nitrogen oxides were always completely depleted before fall turnover. The time of onset and rate of NO3- depletion varied considerably between years and were not always directly correlated with O2 concentration. It was estimated that, on average, O2 consumption, denitrification, and methanogenesis accounted for approximately 80% of hypolimnetic organic C mineralization in the periods surveyed.																			0706-652X					JUN	1991	48	6					1048	1054		10.1139/f91-123	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f91-123													WOS:A1991FV22600012

However, lack of reliable, long-term proxy records greatly impedes understanding of regional temperature sensitivity to climate forcings. Here we present a 16ka long, alkenone-based summer temperature record from Lake Qinghai, northeastern TP that demonstrates major regional temperature response to changes in summer insolation and Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation during the Holocene and late glacial. Importantly, we find a period of sustained summer temperature decline (>4 degrees C) between 5 and 3.5ka, which coincides with expansion of Barents Sea ice coverage and is likely driven by intensification of the Westerlies. This unusually long and pronounced regional cooling event likely delayed permanent human settlements on the high-altitude regions (>3000m) of the TP by at least 500years.

Evaluating the waterfowl breeding population and habitat survey for scaup	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Potential bias in breeding population estimates of certain duck species from the Waterfowl Breeding Population and Habitat Survey (WBPHS) has been a concern for decades. The WBPHS does not differentiate between lesser (Aythya affinis) and greater (A. marila) scaup, but lesser scaup comprise 89% of the combined scaup population and their population estimates are suspected to be biased. We marked female lesser scaup (i.e., marked scaup) in the Mississippi and Atlantic Flyways, Canada and United States, with implantable satellite transmitters to track their spring migration through the traditional and eastern survey areas of the WBPHS, 2005-2010. Our goal was to use data independent of the WBPHS to evaluate whether breeding population estimates for scaup were biased and identify variables that might be used in the future to refine population estimates. We found that the WBPHS estimates of breeding scaup are biased because, across years, only 30% of our marked scaup had settled for the breeding period when the strata in which they settled were surveyed, 43% were available to be counted in multiple survey strata as their migration continued during the WBPHS, 32% settled outside the WBPHS area, the number of times a marked scaup was available to be counted by survey crews varied positively with the latitude that a marked scaup settled on breeding areas, the probability of a marked scaup being in a stratum while it was surveyed varied among years, and these probabilities were positively correlated with the traditional and eastern breeding population estimates for scaup. Annual population estimates derived from banding data provide a less biased and preferable method of monitoring scaup population status and trend. Development of models that include metrics such as survey stratum latitude and annual spring environmental conditions might potentially be used to improve scaup breeding population estimates derived from the WBPHS, but independent estimates from banding data would be important to evaluate such models.

J	Channing, A				Channing, Alan			A review of active hot-spring analogues of Rhynie: environments, habitats and ecosystems	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												The Lower Devonian Rhynie chert formed as silica sinter entombed an early terrestrial ecosystem. Silica sinter precipitates only from water flowing from alkali - chloride hot springs and geysers, the surface expression of crustalscale geothermal systems that form low - sulfidation mineral deposits in the shallowsubsurface. Active alkali - chloride hot springs at Yellowstone National Park create a suite of geothermally influenced environments; vent pools, sinter aprons, run - off streams, supra - apron terrace pools and geothermal wetlands that are habitats for modern hot - spring ecosystems. The plant - rich chert, which makes Rhynie internationally famous, probably formed in lowtemperature environments at the margins of a sinter apron where frequent flooding by geothermal water and less frequent flooding by river waters created ephemeral to permanent wetland conditions. Here, the plants and associated microbes and animals would be immersed in waters with elevated temperature, brackish salinity, high pH and a cocktail of phytotoxic elements which created stresses that the fossil ecosystem must have tolerated. The environment excluded coeval mesophytic plants, creating a low - diversity hot - spring flora. Comparison with Yellowstone suggests the Rhynie plants were preadapted to their environment by life in more common and widespread environments with elevated salinity and pH such as coastal marshes, salt lakes, estuaries and saline seeps.

The objective of this research was to adapt the CROPGRO V4.0 growth simulation model in order to predict growth and tissue N concentration of bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Flugge) in response to daily weather, N fertilization, and harvest management. To remain consistent with other crops the model simulates, the source code was not modified. The model's species and cultivar files were modified for bahiagrass, based first on literature information, and secondly, on optimization against field data. Herbage growth and N concentration data from a 2-yr experiment at Ona, FL and a 3-yr experiment at Eagle Lake, TX were used for optimization and model testing. The model, with literature-based estimates of photosynthetic rate, temperature sensitivities, and tissue compositions, predicted growth and composition reasonably well, confirming that C and N balances can be predicted from literature-inputs. Optimization of temperature sensitivities and target tissue N levels improved predictability. Because CROPGRO was developed for annual grain crops, the model was not able to predict winter dormancy, nor could it predict regrowth from a reserve pool if all the foliage had been killed, as in a freeze. Simulations persist through the winter if the freeze-kill inputs are turned off, but this led to unsatisfactory (excessive) water and soil N uptake in late-winter and early spring when the real crop was dormant. While this version can be used with some cautions, we conclude that the CROPGRO source code must be modified to add a dormancy routine, add a stolon storage organ to allow regrowth, and include day length effects regulating partitioning of reserves to stolons.

It was confirmed that the chlorophyll a concentration in the lake was high during the time when the white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons) flew in and decreased after it flew away. From the results of a dilution bioassay, it was shown that the limiting nutrient changed from nitrogen to phosphorus during the rapid growth of phytoplankton from late summer to autumn. This suggests that the direct load of ammonium nitrogen leaching from the excrement of geese on the lake was occurred, and then, that the growth of phytoplankton was promoted with the increase of ammonium-nitrogen concentration in water. After that, an excessive supply of ammonium nitrogen from the excrement of geese made phosphorus a limiting nutrient. These results could be useful for the conservation and regeneration of the water quality of Lake Miyajima-numa with appropriate management of migratory waterfowl to reduce nutrient loads in the future.																			0525-1931						2020	69	12					747	752																WOS:000598113600012
J	Effler, SW; Matthews, DA				Effler, SW; Matthews, DA			Sediment resuspension and drawdown in a water supply reservoir	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												The magnitudes and patterns of sediment resuspension are assessed in Cannonsville Reservoir, New York, to quantify and characterize this internal source of sediment. The assessment is based on analyses of sediment trap collections from 10 sites over the spring to fall interval of two years. Temporal and spatial patterns in sediment deposition are demonstrated to be driven by resuspension/redeposition processes. Sediment that had been resuspended and redeposited represented 80 to 96 percent, on average, of the depositing solids collected along the main axis of the lake. About 90 percent of the redeposited sediment was inorganic. Increased resuspension caused by drawdown of the reservoir surface and fall turnover resulted in 10 to 50-fold increases in deposition rates compared to levels observed when the reservoir was full and strongly thermally stratified. Elevated levels of redeposition from resuspension in the reservoir have been driven by both higher water column concentrations of suspended solids and settling velocities. Recurring longitudinal and lateral gradients in resuspension are delineated, establishing that resuspended solids are transported from the riverine to the lacustrine zone and from near-shore to pelagic areas. Resuspension is demonstrated to cause increases in inanimate particle (tripton) concentrations. Higher tripton levels have been observed in years with greater drawdown. Water quality impacts of the resuspension phenomenon are considered.																			1093-474X					FEB	2004	40	1					251	264		10.1111/j.1752-1688.2004.tb01023.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2004.tb01023.x													WOS:000220590800019

These streams exhibited spatial and seasonal gradients in water pH ranging from pH values of 4.5 to 7.0. Measurements of microbial biomass (ATP), bacterial numbers, and bacterial production (thymidine incorporation) on leaves of Acer saccharum were made over a 9-mo period (fall to spring). Decomposition of A. saccharum leaves was significantly decreased at lower pH. The developing epiphytic microbial community was affected in a very specific way. Bacterial numbers were not related to water pH values, nor were ATP measurements significantly correlated with pH or any pH-related water chemistry variable. However, thymidine incorporation by bacteria on leaf material (used as a measure of bacterial productivity) was significantly decreased at lower pH. This was the only consistent indicator of reduced microbial activity in response to acidification of these streams.																			0706-652X					SEP	1992	49	9					1916	1923		10.1139/f92-212	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f92-212													WOS:A1992JQ45800019
J	Mahajan, GB; Balachandran, L				Mahajan, Girish B.; Balachandran, Lakshmi			Sources of antibiotics: Hot springs	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY												The discovery of antibiotics heralded an era of improved health care. However, the over-prescription and misuse of antibiotics resulted in the development of resistant strains of various pathogens. Since then, there has been an incessant search for discovering novel compounds from bacteria at various locations with extreme conditions. The soil is one of the most explored locations for bioprospecting. In recent times, hypersaline environments and symbiotic associations have been investigated for novel antimicrobial compounds. Among the extreme environments, hot springs are comparatively less explored. Many researchers have reported the presence of microbial life and secretion of antimicrobial compounds by microorganisms in hot springs. A pioneering research in the corresponding author's laboratory resulted in the identification of the antibiotic Fusaricidin 13 isolated from a hot spring derived eubacteria, Paenibacillus polymyxa, which has been assigned a new application for its anti-tubercular properties. The corresponding author has also reported anti-MRSA and anti-VRE activity of 73 bacterial isolates from hot springs in India. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Such data have not previously been collected for this lake type. Using a new error analysis technique, nutrient budgets were constructed and analyzed for patterns and relative importance of material flow pathways. Of total annual particulate organic C inputs to the water column of 15.9 g/m2, .apprxeq. 83% was allochthonous, mainly from fluvial and snowpack inputs in the spring and litter inputs in the fall. Annual allochthonous inputs of soluble reactive P and dissolved inorganic N averaged 0.12 g/m2 and 2.24 g/m2, respectively. Spring fluvial sources provided 33-50% of these annual incomes. Zooplankton excretion of soluble reactive phosphate was comparable to allochthonous inputs of soluble reactive pnosphate, and .apprxeq. 18% of total inputs of dissolved inorganic N was autochthonous. Particulate losses were assignable to both fluvial and sedimentation processes, while .apprxeq. 70% of soluble reactive phosphate and dissolved inorganic N incomes were lost through the outflow and the rest to uptake. Allochthonous dissolved organic C inputs (68 g/m2) and allochthonous dissolved organic P inputs (0.21 g/m2) were mostly fluvial and .apprxeq. 100% were lost fluvially. These data are related to those of other lakes, and patterns and apparent anomalies are discussed. Terrestrial inputs to the sediments, and the subsequent cycling of nutrients in the sediments, have a major influence on biological activity in both benthic and water-column environments during most of the growing season.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1979	60	2					318	328		10.2307/1937661	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1937661													WOS:A1979HD78300010

Infections by adult stages of A. crassus in the swimbladder lumen occurred with a prevalence of 45% (n = 479), a mean intensity (+/- SE) of 2.3 +/- 0.2 worms per infected eel (range = 1-22), and a mean abundance of 2.0 +/- 0.1 among all eels. Infections by larval stages of A. crassus in the swimbladder wall occurred with a prevalence, intensity, and abundance of 29%, 2.4 +/- 0.3 (range = 1-15), and 0.7 +/- 0.1, respectively (n = 471). Overall prevalence of the parasite (any stage) was 58%, with a mean intensity +/- SE of 3.0 +/- 0.2 and a mean abundance of 1.8 +/- 0.2. Biomass of the adult parasite stage varied significantly with eel body length, but the direction of the effect depended on salinity. Prevalence and intensity of infection by adult nematodes varied by locality but not by eel total length, salinity, or season. Larval prevalence was significantly greater in the winter and spring and also differed among localities. The lack of seasonal effects on infection by the adult worm stage contrasts with studies from higher latitudes in North America and Europe and may be due to the warmer winter temperatures at southern latitudes. Significant variation in infection among localities reflects possible differences in abundance of intermediate and/or paratenic hosts. Overall, infection levels were higher than previous reports for eels in SC but comparable to more recent reports from other areas in North America.					; Arnott, Stephen/D-1014-2013; de Buron, Isaure/LDE-5042-2024	de Buron, Isaure/0000-0001-5560-3325; Arnott, Stephen/0000-0003-0761-709X; 													0177-5103	1616-1580				JAN 16	2014	107	3					199	209		10.3354/dao02686	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/dao02686								24429471					WOS:000330721400004

Trappability and population structure, in age, sex and residency classes, varied between habitats, but population turnover was high, leading to complete replacement of individuals in two populations monitored for two years. The availability of the preferred prey, crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes appeared to be a major factor determining population size and preferred breeding areas. Control methods are either unnecessary or are likely to fail in most situations, and may be counterproductive.																			0952-8369					JUN	1991	224		2				233	249		10.1111/j.1469-7998.1991.tb04802.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.1991.tb04802.x													WOS:A1991FU87300006

A single haplotype (haplotype 1) predominated in all the fish sampled from these lakes, which is consistent with the observed distribution of this haplotype in northern portions of the species range. However, haplotype I does not occur in a high frequency within the hatchery strain., In a direct survivorship experiment, of 1500 fish stocked into an Ontario lake in the spring of 1994 containing a native population of brook charr, no significant differences between stocking and recapture mtDNA distributions were observed in the summer of 1994. However, a survey of young of the year in the following spring did not reveal the presence of any 'private' hatchery haplotypes. Significant differences in the distribution of mtDNA haplotypes were observed in two stocked lakes,compared to those in the putative source hatchery strain. Haplotype I predominated in both these stocked lakes, suggesting that fish with this haplotype possessed increased survivorship.

Glacier/snow melting during the summer season is the main source of water. Here, we are presenting the major ion chemistry of the Indus river water, its tributary rivers, including small streams (nallahs), mainly in the territory of India, to know the overall quality of water, and geochemical processes controlling the solute acquisition and sources of elements in the catchment region. The analytical results indicate that the water samples are mildly acidic to alkaline in nature and have Ca2+ and Mg2+ dominance in cationic and HCO3- and Cl- in anionic composition. Overall, alkaline-earth elements (Ca2+ + Mg2+) dominate over alkalis (Na+ + K+), and weak acids (HCO3-) exceed strong acids (SO42- + Cl-) in the river/stream water samples. The hydrogeochemical diagrams, molar ratios, and statistical analysis suggest that carbonate and silicates minerals' weathering mainly control the solute acquisition process with negligible contribution from marine or anthropogenic sources. Most of the surface water samples are fit for drinking and domestic uses except the hot spring and saline lake waters.

J	QUINN, FH; GUERRA, B				QUINN, FH; GUERRA, B			CURRENT PERSPECTIVES ON THE LAKE ERIE WATER-BALANCE	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												An analysis was conducted of the Lake Erie water balance for 1940-79, based upon the individual hydrologic components, including thermal expansion and consumptive use. Particular emphasis was given to the community of the system. Annual and monthly statistics are presented for each of the water balance components. While the Detroit River contributed 87 percent of the Lake Erie total water supply, the variability of the net basin supplies was also found to be of importance in explaining annual water level fluctuations. A major step function was found to occur in the annual water balance between 1958 and 1959, which illustrates the large discontinuities that can occur when calculating the net basin supplies from residuals rather than directly from precipitation, runoff, and evaporation. The annual water balance for 1959-79 was found to be well satisfied with an average annual residual of about 0.5 percent of the Detroit River or Niagara River flow. A distinct seasonality was noted in the mass continuity of the monthly water balance. Also on a seasonal basis, the change in storage due to thermal expansion was significant during the late spring and early fall months.																			0380-1330						1986	12	2					109	116		10.1016/S0380-1330(86)71705-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(86)71705-X													WOS:A1986C796000003
J	Tian, YQ; Deng, JM; Li, M				Tian, Yaqi; Deng, Jianming; Li, Ming			Response of the cellular components to environmental factors indicates limiting factors of Microcystis in Lake Taihu	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Studying the influence of environmental factors on the growth and physiological state of cyanobacteria is an important basis for understanding the formation of cyanobacteria content. This study selected Microcystis aeruginosa as an example, using algal pigment and fatty acid composition to reflect the physiological state of Microcystis, and analyzed the effects of environmental changes on the basic physiological indicators of Microcystis cells. The results showed that an increase in light strength caused the ratio of Chlorophyll a to proteins to decrease and then increase, but has little effect on fatty acids. Increasing the temperature caused Microcystis cells to increase photosynthesis pigments and polysaccharides to proteins ratio and caused fatty acid Palmitic acid C16:0 to decrease and then increase, as opposed to linoleic acid gamma-C18:3. When the N:P ratio was 9.4, an increase in N concentration caused the Chlorophyll a to PR ratio to increase, and PS, TOC, beta-carotene and zeaxanthin to PR ratio decrease. At P = 1.7 mg L-1, an increase N:P ratio promoted photosynthetic pigmentation of algae, which increased the PS to PR ratio. During autumn and winter, the fatty acids of Lake Taihu Microcystis cells were mostly C16:0 and C18:1, of which C16:0 changed most significantly during the winter period, showing a trend of decreasing first and then increasing later. Cluster analysis and the comparison of laboratory data found that the limiting factors affecting the growth of Lake Taihu Microcystis during this period were mainly temperature and nitrogen concentrations.

J	Swanson, SK; Bahr, JM; Schwar, MT; Potter, KW				Swanson, SK; Bahr, JM; Schwar, MT; Potter, KW			Two-way cluster analysis of geochemical data to constrain spring source waters	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												The purpose of the study was to use geochemical characteristics and apparent ages of sampled groundwaters to determine which of the two regionally extensive bedrock aquifers, the lower bedrock aquifer or the upper bedrock aquifer, is a more likely source of water discharging to springs in the Nine Springs watershed. The use of summary statistics and our knowledge of the regional hydrostratigraphy resulted in the identification of three groups of monitoring points that are representative of groundwaters with distinct geochemical characteristics. Two-way cluster analysis of the geochemical data supports these groupings and further identifies subtle geochemical characteristics of the groups. One spring, which is representative of smaller springs and seeps found in the watershed, belongs to a group that is characterized by variable nitrate and chloride concentrations. Water discharging from this spring has a groundwater residence time of approximately 8 years based on the tritium/helium 3 dating method. The water discharging to this small spring is thought to have traveled primarily through the unlithified aquifer, as opposed to either of the major bedrock aquifers. Most of the springs in the watershed belong to a group that is characterized by elevated, but consistent, nitrate, sodium, and chloride concentrations. In addition, cluster analysis revealed that potassium and alkalinity concentrations are somewhat low. Apparent groundwater ages for this group range from 10 to 15 years. The water discharging from the majority of the springs in the watershed is thought to have traveled primarily through the unlithified aquifer and the upper bedrock aquifer before discharging into the former glacial lakebed wetland complex. Due to the relatively short groundwater residence times, spring water quality and flow in the Nine Springs watershed are likely to be vulnerable to the rapid urban expansion occurring within the watershed.

A good agreement was found between caloric equivalents calculated from chemical data and those determined directly by microbomb calorimetry. The total seston had a strikingly lower caloric content than net phytoplankton. This could be attributed to a high ash content of the seston and to the presence of low caloric organic detritus in the seston. Implications to the applicability of caloric values derived from field samples to the study of the flux of energy through aquatic ecosystems were considered. The N:P ratio of the seston was suggested to be a potential macroscopic characteristic of the trophic-dynamic status of lakes.

J	Cui, LL; Wei, ZH; Zhou, LZ; Cheng, B				Cui, Lingling; Wei, Zhenhua; Zhou, Lizhi; Cheng, Bo			Effects of constant high water levels in winter on waterbird diversity in Caizi Lakes: A functional perspective	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												The middle and lower Yangtze River floodplain lakes are important stopover and wintering sites for migratory birds on the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. The periodic water level fluctuation of the lakes plays a critical role in the aggregation of waterbirds. However, the construction of a series of gates and dams has impeded the hydrological connectivity between rivers and lakes and disrupted the natural water level fluctuation patterns of lakes. The water level status of lakes influences habitat utilization by waterbirds. In recent years, Caizi Lakes, the gate -controlled lakes connected to the Yangtze River due to the need for water level regulation requirements, has experienced sustained high water levels in winter, which can reduce habitat quality and in turn influence waterbirds activity. In the present study, wintering waterbirds in Caizi Lakes were surveyed during the 2021-2022 (W1) and 2022-2023 (W2) wintering periods. Moreover, we explored the effects of constant high water levels in winter on waterbird assemblages by comparing species richness, abundance, and functional alpha and beta diversity. Correlation analyses were then performed to elucidate the relationship between habitat factors and water level changes during the wintering period of migratory waterbirds and between changes in various habitat factors and wintering waterbird assemblages under different hydrological conditions. The results showed that functional beta diversity was more sensitive to changes in waterbird assemblages in Caizi Lakes than functional alpha diversity. Moreover, constant high water levels in the mid -wintering period decreased suitable habitats for wintering waterbirds, increased functional turnover among waterbird assemblages, increased total dissimilarity among assemblages significantly, and decreased the level of functional nestedness significantly. Additionally, the areas of the three wetland habitats in Caizi Lakes were significantly correlated with water level changes during W1 and relatively less affected by water level changes under constant high water level conditions during W2. The changes in habitat area were influenced primarily by anthropogenic activities, with an increase in meadow area favorable for species richness and abundance, as well as functionally nested components. Water level regulation should take into consideration the natural hydrological rhythms of the declining water level to ensure that adequate and suitable habitats are provided for wintering waterbirds.

This first paper presents a case study on water quality assessment of the Mogosoaia, Herastrau and Pantelimon Lakes, lakes built on the Colentina River. Two water and sediment sampling campaigns were conducted in the summer and autumn 2016, 29 specific parameters were determined for water samples and heavy metals content for sediment samples. The obtained results for water samples allowed the classification of lakes water in quality classes and the heavy metals values for sediments were compared to the standards of chemical quality, according to the national legislation M.O. 161/2006. Furthermore, for an overview of water quality, the Water Quality Index (WQI) method was used, where the indicators were grouped into two categories: the first category took into account 18 quality parameters (WQI-1) and the second considered heavy metals content (WQI-2).

J	NEILL, WE				NEILL, WE			IMPACT OF CHAOBORUS PREDATION UPON THE STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS OF A CRUSTACEAN ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITY	OECOLOGIA												During ice-free seasons of 1975, 1977 and 1978, replicated experimental alteration of spring densities of predatory Chaoborus larvae inside 20-27 m3 enclosures in a fishless oligotrophic lake had relatively small, but significant, short-term effects on prey species abundances. Enhancement of predator densities generally had greater numerical effects relative to controls than did complete removal of predators. With the exception of Diaphanosoma and Bosmina under artificially elevated Chaoborus densities, numerical effects on prey species did not persist for more than a few weeks after midsummer in these 3 yr. During cooler 1976 much larger Chaoborus effects in May and June persisted into Sept. Low temperatures and small initial population densities slowed population growth and tended to increase the proportion of each species'' recruitment lost to Chaoborus predation. As water temperatures increased during 3 of 4 summers, rapid juvenile development and compensating increase in adult fertility generally permitted most prey species to escape regulation by these large, univoltine and semivoltine predators. With growing prey population size, declining food levels suppressed crustacean fecundity in July and Aug., permitting predatory losses to climb again to substantial fractions of the reduced prey recruitment. Prey densities in predator-free and control or predator-enhanced enclosures differed little from July-Sept. (except in 1976). Summer population growth of most prey species seemed more limited by food storages than by predators per se. Growth of individual zooplankters was affected by food availability during critical periods in July and Aug. in all years, and Chaoborus predation seemed to influence the timing of this food limitation in at least 2 of the 4 yr.																			0029-8549	1432-1939					1981	48	2					164	177		10.1007/BF00347959	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00347959								28309795					WOS:A1981LH68600004

N.; Paasche, Oyvind; Hirt, Ann M.; Kumari, Monika			Magnetic and geochemical signatures of flood layers in a lake system	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												River floods holds the capasity to erode and transport sediments that are deposited whenever the discharge is reduced. In catchments that are subjected to repeated flooding, downstream lakes can therefore contain a record of past events across multiple timescales. High-resolution core scanning analyses, such as X-ray fluorescence (XRF) scanning and magnetic susceptibility (MS) provide data that are frequently used to detect flood layers in soft sediment archives, such as lakes, fjords and ocean basins. Deposits of past floods also can potentially reveal information about the evolution of flood events as well as source area. Here we explore ways in which subtle variability in high-resolution data can be utilized and subsequently vetted by high-precision measurements in order to delineate the copious information that can be extracted from soft sediment records. By combining magnetic hysteresis measurements and first-order reversal curves (FORCs) with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) measurements of chemical elements on 36 samples, questions about flood dynamics and variability are raised, and also sources of noise in high-resolution scanning techniques are discussed. Specifically, we show that a lake flood record from Southern Norway containing 92 floods distributed over 10,000 years can be subdivided into two groups of floods that were generated either by spring snow melting, intense summer rainstorms, or a combination of both. The temporal evolution of this pattern shows a marked shift toward spring floods around 2000 years ago compared to the earlier part of the record.					; Hirt, Ann/M-5540-2016	Paasche, Oyvind/0000-0003-0329-9063; Hirt, Ann/0000-0002-2193-0472														1525-2027				OCT	2016	17	10					4236	4253		10.1002/2016GC006540	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016GC006540													WOS:000388694600024
J	Tokano, T				Tokano, Tetsuya			Limnological Structure of Titan's Hydrocarbon Lakes and Its Astrobiological Implication	ASTROBIOLOGY												Cassini radar recently detected several putative liquid hydrocarbon lakes in the polar region of Saturn's moon Titan. Such lakes may contain organic sediments deposited from the atmosphere that would promote prebiotic-type chemistry driven by cosmic rays, the result of which could be the production of more complex molecules such as nitrogen-bearing organic polymer or azides. The physical properties of the lake and their temporal evolution under Titan's present climatic setting were investigated by means of a one-dimensional lake thermal stratification model. Lakes can undergo various evolutions, depending on the initial composition and depth of the lake and hydrocarbon abundance in the near-surface atmosphere. Pure methane ponds, which may occasionally form when heavy methane hailstones reach the surface, would be transitory in that they would evaporate, freeze up, and eventually dry up. On the other hand, lakes filled with a mixture of methane, ethane, and nitrogen would be more stable; and freezing or drying would not necessarily occur in most cases. Such lakes undergo a seasonal cycle of thermal stratification in spring and early summer and convective overturning in other seasons. The summer thermal stratification near the lake surface could be destabilized by bottom heating as a result of an enhanced geothermal heat flux, e. g., in the vicinity of cryovolcanoes. Most likely the composition of the lake and atmosphere would come to equilibrium by way of a small amount of evaporation, but the lake-atmosphere system could be repeatedly brought out of equilibrium by irregular precipitation. The viability of prebiotic-like chemistry in the lake may depend on many lake parameters, such as temperature, liquid or frozen state, and convective mixing. Moreover, convective mixing may drive suspension of solid acetylene and other sediments on the lake bottom and redistribution of dissolved gases, which might be relevant for putative life-forms that consume hydrogen and solid acetylene.																			1531-1074	1557-8070				MAR	2009	9	2					147	164		10.1089/ast.2007.0220	http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/ast.2007.0220								19371158					WOS:000265707200002
J	Young, JD; Winter, JG; Molot, L				Young, Joelle D.; Winter, Jennifer G.; Molot, Lewis			A re-evaluation of the empirical relationships connecting dissolved oxygen and phosphorus loading after dreissenid mussel invasion in Lake Simcoe	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake Simcoe has had many stressors in the past decades. High total phosphorus (TP) loads into the lake led to end-of-summer volume-weighted hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen (MVWHDO) levels that were lethal to coldwater fish species. Additionally, dreissenid mussels became established in the lake around 1996, and may have affected nutrient cycling and phytoplankton abundance. Using data averaged over two time periods following dreissenid mussel establishment, we re-evaluated empirical relationships connecting TP loading rate and MVWHDO concentration that were developed with pre-dreissenid data. Oxygen depletion rate predicted chlorophyll (Chla) well within the range of other Ontario lakes. Measured Chla corresponded well with Chla predicted from lake TP concentration except at the shallowest station, indicating that the lake may becoming more spatially heterogeneous. Interestingly though, the Chla:TP temporal trend increased post-dreissenids when it is often observed to decrease (e.g., Great Lakes). Measured lake TP concentration was better predicted by TP loads when averaged over the ice-free season compared with the spring. The final model predicted MVWHDO directly from TP load very closely except for the 2002-2006 time period when the end-of-summer date was September 15 rather than September 30, suggesting that the date when MVWHDO is determined should be continuously re-evaluated. Additionally, trend analyses on each variable from 1980 to 2008 did not identify any changes that coincided with dreissenid establishment. Given that this model appears to be sound for the post-dreissenid period, an estimated TP load of 44 tonnes/yr was predicted that would yield the current MVWHDO target level of 7 mg/L.

The spatial and temporal variation suggested that some areas of Lake Taihu are contanimanted by microcystin (MCs), especially during the Summer and Autumn, in the places of Meiliang Bay, Gonghu Bay and Yixing Bay. At Meiliang Bay, the maximum concentration of intracellular MC-RR and MC-LR reached as high as 12.3 mu g/L and 7.3 mu g/L in October, while for extracellular MCs, the number of it peaked in August (0.12 mu g/L and 0.18 mu g/L) at Meiliang Bay, followed by the number of it in Gonghu Bay and Yixing Bay. This suggested that the municipal contamination, industrial wastewater and traffics should be responsible for the occurrence of cyanobacteria bloom. The ratio for intracellular MCs to extracellular MCs was extremely high, reach as high as 220 times, thus the intracellular MCs was a big potential hazard to ecosystem. The spatial variablity of MCs also referred that some solutions, such as aquatic macrophyte, may be functional in the prevention of cyanobacteria bloom.

Determining the salinity sources of the Barme Jamal karstic spring, Meydavod, Iran	CARBONATES AND EVAPORITES												The Barme Jamal is an important karstic spring with mean discharge of 1.3 m(3)/s, located in the Meydavod county southwestern of Iran. Its outlet appeared in the Asmari limestone formation and drains the karstic limbs of Kuhe-Safid anticline. Naturally, the spring water salinity is more than expected for a karstic spring with EC about 2100 ms/cm. The spring water contains high concentration of SO4 and Cl with Ca-SO4 water type. Therefore, hydrogeochemical studies have conducted to determine the factors controlling the spring water salinity using hydrochemical techniques such as time series of chemical parameters, relative ion concentrations, Br/Cl ratios, TOC and mixing diagrams. The potential salinity sources such as mixing of karst freshwater with evaporites formation water and oil-field brine were investigated to determine the role of each source in the spring water salinity. The results reveal that the mixing of saline waters from evaporite formations is the main source of groundwater salinity. The hydrochemical time series illustrate that EC and Na-Cl are increasing in the spring water with almost constant rate throughout the studying period suggested the evaporites karst development in the spring catchment area and extension of dissolution conduits in the contact of limestone and evaporites formations.					kalantari, nasrollah/AAI-8903-2021														0891-2556	1878-5212				APR 3	2020	35	2							46	10.1007/s13146-020-00567-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13146-020-00567-8													WOS:000523159900001

The yellow perch population is in decline because of low juvenile survival. However, diet analyses indicate that predation by adult smelt does not appear to be the cause. We investigated interactions between age-0 yellow perch and age-0 rainbow smelt by comparing changes in abundance and distributions. maximum mouth gapes, and the amount and type of prey eaten. During 1995 and 1996, age-0 smelt and perch hatched at similar times, had similar spatial distributions, and preferred similar prey. Diet overlap exceeded 45% on all sampling dates during the spring and summer of 1995 and 1996 and exceeded 60% on all but the first and last sampling dates in 1996. Two species of Diaptomus were the preferred prey of both smelt and perch, although smelt ate more of the larger size-classes than did perch throughout 1996. Consumption by smelt may have led to a decline in Diaptomus during the early summer of 1996. Estimates of temperature, hatch date, and growth derived from a long-term data set were used as input for bioenergetics simulations that estimated the proportion of maximum attainable consumption realized by the average age-0 perch in each year, when they occurred, between 1981 and 1996. During 1995 and 1996. years where age-0 smelt and perch were documented together, the proportion of maximum attainable consumption was significantly below that of any successful year-class observed during the long-term record. Age-0 perch did not survive in measurable numbers through the entire summer in either 1995 or 1996. Exploitation competition between age-0 perch and smelt may reduce the likelihood of strong year-classes of yellow perch when year-classes of rainbow smelt occur.					; Hrabik, Thomas/GYA-2566-2022; Carey, Michael/G-9516-2012	Carey, Michael/0000-0002-3327-8995; 													0002-8487					JUL	2001	130	4					568	582		10.1577/1548-8659(2001)130<0568:IBYOTY>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2001)130<0568:IBYOTY>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000169852700004
J	SHIOZAWA, DK				SHIOZAWA, DK			THE SEASONAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND DRIFT OF MICROCRUSTACEANS IN VALLEY-CREEK, MINNESOTA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Microcrustaceans represent a poorly known component of stream systems. This study examined the seasonal abundance of copepods and cladocerans found in Valley Creek, Washington County, Minnesota. Both benthic densities as well as drift rates were quantified. A total of 16 species was collected in quantitative benthic samples and two additional species occurred in drift samples. The Valley Creek microcrustaceans could be classified into two general groups, those residing in depositional stream habitats similar to a lake or pond littoral and favoring an epibenthic lifestyle, and those found in more erosional habitats where a hyporheic lifestyle is more likely. The microcrustacean community also demonstrated a distinct seasonality with peak abundance in the spring and early summer. Sediment size composition also demonstrated a seasonal change but detrital composition did not. Microcrustacean drift generally paralleled changes in benthic density but in several cases it tended to lag behind the changes in the benthos. This lag could be due to a seasonal situation of the sediments, which would compress the habitat volume available to interstitial meiofaunal elements.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				AUG	1986	64	8					1655	1664		10.1139/z86-249	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z86-249													WOS:A1986E207300009
J	Elliott, JA; Jones, ID; Thackeray, SJ				Elliott, JA; Jones, ID; Thackeray, SJ			Testing the sensitivity of phytoplankton communities to changes in water temperature and nutrient load, in a temperate lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Freshwater lakes are biologically sensitive to changes in the surrounding environment and the impacts that such changes have on their water quality are of considerable ecological, recreational and economic importance. In this study the phytoplankton community model, PROTECH, was used to experiment with the effects of elevated temperatures and increased nutrient load on phytoplankton succession and productivity. The response of a phytoplankton community to combined incremental changes in these drivers was analysed, in order to elucidate the resulting ecological changes. Annual mean phytoplankton biomass increased with increases in temperature and nutrient loading, although the latter had the larger effect. The phenology of the dominant phytoplankton taxa changed with increasing water temperature; the three spring blooming species all peaked earlier in the year. The simulated summer bloom of Anabaena became earlier in the year and the Chlorella bloom later. The increased phytoplankton biomass was largely dominated by the cyanobacterium Anabaena, which was especially prevalent during the summer bloom. This resulted in a progressive loss of phytoplankton biodiversity with increasing water temperature and nutrient supply. Model experimentation showed that whilst both factors greatly affected the community, the changes to nutrient loading generally had the greater effect and that at low nutrient levels the effect of water temperature change was reduced considerably. Finally, the model predicted that cyanobacteria have the potential to dominate the phytoplankton community, with clear consequences for water quality, and that this dominance was at its greatest when high water temperatures were combined with high nutrient loads.

Ladder hydraulics and fish ascent	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY					3rd Annual Conference on Sturgeons of the North American Chapter of the World-Sturgeon-Conservation-Society	AUG 31-SEP 02, 2010	World Sturgeon Conservat Soc (WSCS), N Amer Chapter (NAC), Bozeman, MT		World Sturgeon Conservat Soc (WSCS), N Amer Chapter (NAC)			Research and development of a fish ladder for sturgeons requires understanding ladder hydraulics and sturgeon behaviour in the ladder to insure the ladder is safe and provides effective passage. After years of research and development, we designed and constructed a full-scale prototype side-baffle ladder inside a spiral flume (38.3 m long x 1 m wide x 1 m high) on a 6% (1 : 16.5) slope with a 1.92-m rise in elevation (bottom to top) to test use by sturgeons. Twenty-eight triangular side baffles, each extending part way across the flume, alternated from inside wall to outside wall down the ladder creating two major flow habitats: a continuous, sinusoidal flow down the ladder through the vertical openings of side-baffles and an eddy below each side baffle. Ascent and behaviour was observed on 22 cultured Lake Sturgeon = LS (Acipenser fulvescens) repeatedly tested in groups as juveniles (as small as 105.1 cm TL, mean) or as adults (mean TL, 118 cm) during four periods (fall 2002 and 2003; spring 2003 and 2007). Percent of juveniles entering the ladder that ascended to the top was greater in spring (72.7%) than in fall (40.945.5%) and 90.9% of 11 adults, which ascended as juveniles, ascended to the top. Six LS (27.3%) never swam to the top and seven (31.8%) swam to the top in all tests, indicating great variability among individuals for ascent drive. Some LS swam directly to the top in <1 min, but most rested in an eddy during ascent. Juveniles swimming through outside wall baffle slots (mean velocity, 1.2 m s(-1)) swam at 1.82.2 body lengths s(-1) and 3.23.3 tail beats s(-1), either at or approaching prolonged swimming speed. The side-baffle ladder was stream-like and provided key factors for a sturgeon ladder: a continuous flow and no full cross-channel walls, abundant eddies for resting, an acceptable water depth, and a water velocity fish could ascend swimming 2 bl s(-1). A side-baffle ladder passes LS and other moderate-swimming fishes.																			0175-8659					NOV	2011	27			2	SI		77	88		10.1111/j.1439-0426.2011.01831.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0426.2011.01831.x													WOS:000297848300011

Crucial sites and environmental variables for wintering migratory waterbirds are of great concern in the Dongting Lake wetlands. In this research, based on annual (2003/2004-2016/2017) waterbird and habitat census data, we recognized the crucial sites for waterbirds during wintering seasons by comparing the difference of waterbird populations at the community, foraging guild and species levels in different natural wetlands within East Dongting Lake, and then identified the crucial environmental variables affecting waterbird distributions by analyzing the relationship between waterbird populations and the environmental variables, including vegetation area, mudflat area, water area with the depth of 0-20 cm, water area with the depth of 20-50 cm, water area with the depth of 50-100 cm, water area with the depth > 100 cm, growth status of vegetation (Min, Mean and Max NDVI), and the human disturbance. Results indicated that five natural wetlands, i.e., Daxiaoxi, Chunfeng, Baihu lakes, Dingzi dyke and Tanjiaweizi, were recognized as the crucial wintering sites for migratory waterbirds in the East Dongting Lake. Among the ten selected environmental variables, water areas with the depth of 0-20 cm, 20-50 cm and > 100 cm, human disturbance, Min and Mean NDVIs were identified as the crucial environmental variables overall. Waterbirds at different levels exhibited significant linear relationship with certain environmental variables, with the exception of Bean goose and Lesser White-fronted goose at the species level, which showed Gaussian distribution with changes in mean NDVI. The crucial environmental variables appeared to be foraging guild- and species-specific. These findings provide significant information for managers to understand the differences of wetlands and waterbird populations within East Dongting Lake, and to make more targeted conservation efforts.

Response of the high-resolution Chinese loess grain size record to the 50°N integrated winter insolation during the last 500,000 years	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The global ice volume change regulates the Earth's climate and has been characterized by 100,000 year cycles over the last 700,000years. The Asian inland winter climate change is proposed to show primary 100,000 year cycles that mimic ice volume changes. Here we calibrate the age of a high-resolution grain size record over the last 500,000years with a grain size age model. The results show a primary 41,000 year cycle and a weaker 100,000 year cycle during the last similar to 500,000years. We suggest that the primary 41,000 year cycle in the grain size record can be ascribed to the 50 degrees N integrated winter insolation. Our findings suggest that ice volume changes have a limited effect on the Asian inland winter climate. Asian continental winter climate changes respond to the 50 degrees N integrated winter insolation in addition to ice volume changes.

Culturable bacteria in Himalayan glacial ice in response to atmospheric circulation	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Only recently has specific attention been given to culturable bacteria in Tibetan glaciers, but their relation to atmospheric circulation is less understood yet. Here we present the results of culturable bacteria preserved in an ice core drilled from the East Rongbuk (ER) glacier, Himalayas. The average concentrations of culturable bacteria are 5.0, 0.8, 0.1 and 0.7 CFU mL(-1) for the glacier ice deposited during the premonsoon, monsoon, postmonsoon and winter seasons, respectively. The high concentration of culturable bacteria in ER glacier deposited during the premonsoon season is attributed to the transportation of continental dust stirred up by the frequent dust storms during spring. This is also confirmed by the spatial distribution of culturable bacteria in Tibetan glaciers. Continental dust originated from the Northwest China accounts for the high abundance of culturable bacteria in the northern Tibetan Plateau, while monsoon moisture exerts great influence on culturable bacteria with low abundance in the southern plateau. The numbers of representatives with different ARDRA patterns from RFLP analysis are 10, 15, 1 and 2 for the glacial ice deposited during the premonsoon, monsoon, postmonsoon and winter seasons, respectively, suggesting that culturable bacteria deposited in ER glacier during monsoon season are more diverse than that deposited during the other seasons, possibly due to their derivation from both marine air masses and local or regional continental sources, while culturable bacteria deposited during the other seasons are from only one possible origin that is transported by westerlies. Our results show the first report of seasonal variations of abundance and species diversity of culturable bacteria recovered from glacial ice in the Himalayas, and we suggest that microorganisms in Himalayan ice might provide a potential new proxy for the reconstruction of atmospheric circulation.

This paper describes the chemical, isotope and microbial features of Lake Bullicante, a small artificial lake located within the urban area of the city of Rome. It has an anthropogenic origin due to excavation works that intercepted the underlying aquifer, giving rise to a water body. The lake area is 7.000 m(2), with a maximum depth of 7 m and located on the distal deposits of the Alban Hills Volcanic District in an area named "Acqua Bullicante" (i.e. Bubbling Water), where degassing phenomena were historically recorded. The proximity of this volcanic district motivated the study on Lake Bullicante as a potential open-air laboratory to trace possible degassing phenomena in a highly urbanized area. A preliminary geochemical and microbial sampling survey was carried out in winter 2018. Samples were collected along a vertical profile of the lake from the surface to the maximum depth. Major, minor, trace elements, dissolved gases and stable isotopes (delta D-H2O, delta O-18-H2O, delta C-13-CO2) were analyzed, along with the analysis of 87Sr/86Sr ratio. The microbial community characteristics were analysed by epifluorescence microscopy (CARD -FISH) and flow cytometry. The chemical composition and water isotopes suggest that lake water has a meteoric origin and is related to a Ca-HCO3 shallow aquifer hosted in volcanic rocks. This is confirmed by both the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio of lake water, which falls in the range of values of Alban Hills volcanites, and the chemical -isotopic composition of neighboring wells. A relatively high concentration of dissolved CO2, its isotopic signature (delta C-13 -CO2 20 parts per thousand V-PDB), and the high content in organic matter (DOC 10-30 mg/L) suggest for the lake an eutrophication state with denitrification also occurring. Considering the relatively high concentrations of dissolved CO, an external input of carbon dioxide cannot be completely excluded -and as a consequence, not even the hypothesis of mixing processes between biotic and inorganic CO2. This makes further investigations necessary especially during the summer, when the lake is stratified. A summer survey could be also useful to better understand the microbial processes into the lake, its eutrophication evolution and health status, and to plan eventual proper remediation strategies, providing important tools to the local administration and stakeholders to improve, protect and preserve this ecological niche.

Measurements of winter and summer air, rain, snow, water, and sediments were obtained over several months and used to determine PCB fluxes to and from the lake, assuming steady-state conditions over 1 year. By solving the mass balance equation under selected conditions, we estimated the deposition velocity and the overall liquid water-to-air mass transfer coefficient for PCBs to be 0.16 cm/s and 0.1 m/day, respectively. Wet deposition was generally 3 times as great as dry deposition and was dominated by particle washout. Rain was a more important removal process than snow. Removal from the lake by volatilization was more important than sedimentation for most congeners.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				JUN	1988	22	6					664	672		10.1021/es00171a008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es00171a008													WOS:A1988N647500015

There was no apparent seasonality in choices of food or volumes consumed. Mysis relicta made up less than 9% of the total food volume and averaged second to Pontoporeia volumetrically-a result which differed from previous investigations for Lake Michigan. Reduced consumption of Mysis in our study compared to previous work may be a function of lower prey density or station depth; mysids may have been farther above the lake botton than at previously studied, more shallow stations. Ostracods were important in 6- and 7-cm fish diets. Mysis, chironomids, and fish eggs were only found in sculpins larger than 8 cm. Chironomid larvae, which typically burrow into sediments, and copepod and cladoceran zooplankton constituted a small percentage of the diet of all sculpins. These results indicate that the deepwater sculpins examined were primarily epibenthic predators at the sediment-water interface and apparently did not burrow for food or feed higher up in the water column.					; Evans, Marlene/NQC-4422-2025	Evans, Marlene/0000-0002-8869-1162; 													0380-1330						1986	12	3					225	231		10.1016/S0380-1330(86)71722-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(86)71722-X													WOS:A1986E185600011

Long-term Trends of Autumn-migrating Buteos Around Henrys Lake Flat, Idaho, USA	JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH												We conducted an annual late-summer raptor survey along a 53-km route around Henrys Lake Flats, Idaho, from 1994 to 2022, and pooled the resulting data with similar published information collected from 1974 to 1993. A mean of 36 Red-tailed Hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), 13 Ferruginous Hawks (Buteo regalis), and 16 Swainson's Hawks (Buteo swainsoni) were observed each year along this route. The counts of Ferruginous Hawks declined significantly (P < 0.001) over the combined study period and were almost 10 times lower from 2013-2022 compared to 1974-1983. The counts of Red-tailed Hawks also declined significantly (P 1/4 0.04), whereas no significant variation was evident for Swainson's Hawks over the combined 49-yr study period. Summer precipitation levels and hawk numbers were not correlated. The observed numbers of Ferruginous Hawks and Red-tailed Hawks were correlated throughout the study period, suggesting similar responses to local environmental and/or land-use factors. Obvious changes in the study area during the corresponding 49 yr include conversion of some pastures to center-pivot-irrigated agriculture and a substantial expansion of all-terrain vehicle trails and recreational activity. Because 88% of Ferruginous Hawks breeding in the Columbia Basin funnel through the upper Snake River Plain and adjacent areas on their way to post-breeding ranges in the Great Plains, expanded surveys in these areas in late August/early September could effectively monitor this intermountain population.																			0892-1016	2162-4569				MAR	2024	58	1								10.3356/JRR-23-21	http://dx.doi.org/10.3356/JRR-23-21													WOS:001193668100005

Most often, studies on migration have focused on how migration strategies are dependent on ecological parameters, but little attention has been paid to the top-down effect of migration on ecosystem processes. Cyprinid fish in many European lakes undergo partial migration, where a part of the population leaves the lake and enters streams for the winter. In this study, we model the effect of partial migration by fish on lower trophic levels in a lake ecosystem. Our results suggest that spring phyto- and zooplankton dynamics, including occurrences of clear-water phases, can be related to the timing and magnitude of partial migration of planktivorous fish. From our results we conclude that partial migration can influence the dynamics of lower trophic levels in the ecosystem. Furthermore, we hypothesize that partial migration may affect the stability of alternative stable states and transitions between them.

Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) equivalent content was determined using a protein phosphatase inhibition assay on extracts of lyophilized plankton. Three of the lakes showed a similar pattern of maximum water column toxicity in late summer, while in the fourth, toxicity was highest in spring and then declined over the year. Variations in water toxicity level could be attributed to the abundance of two potentially toxigenic genera, Microcystis and Anabaena. A multiple regression model explained 75% of the variation in microcystin (MC) concentration, based on water column total nitrogen concentration (TN) and the biomass of these two genera. Microcystis and Anabaena genera appeared to be similarly toxic in all lakes. Increased water column stability, higher light extinction coefficient and a lack of dissolved nutrients were all associated with increased total biomass of toxigenic cyanobacterial genera.

Spatio-temporal variation of sediment transport in the Selenga River Basin, Mongolia and Russia	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Many Asian rivers have been intensively used to boost economic growth, resulting in sudden and drastic changes in sediment transport patterns. However, a few rivers are still undisturbed. The present paper considers the unregulated Selenga River and its basin, located in Russia and Mongolia. The river contributes to 50 % of the total inflow to Lake Baikal. Pending scientific challenges include the quantification of sediment loads and erosion-deposition patterns along the Selenga River system, the understanding of suspended particulate matter composition and the importance of peak flow events for total sediment discharge and heavy metal transport. Field data and hydraulic modeling converge on showing that peak flow events during spring and summer contribute to the main part (70-80 %) of the annual sediment and pollution loads in upstream parts of the basin. The Selenga River carries mostly silt and sand. The average particle size differs by a factor of four between summer floods and base flow periods. The low amount of particulate organic matter (ranging between 1 and 16 % in the studied rivers) is consistent with the significant role of sediments originating from mining areas and in-channel sources. The bed load transport in the downstream part of the river basin is high (up to 50 % of the total transport), and channel storage plays an important role in the total sediment transport to Lake Baikal. Reported statistically significant multi-decadal declines in sediment fluxes in the downstream Selenga River can be attributed to the abandonment of cultivated lands and (most likely) to changing hydroclimatic factors.					; Promakhova, Ekaterina/B-2244-2014; Kasimov, Nikolay/P-7675-2015; Chalov, Sergey/K-1847-2012	Pietron, Jan/0000-0001-5059-0326; Kasimov, Nikolay/0000-0001-9177-6020; Promakhova, Ekaterina/0000-0003-2288-0494; Jarsjo, Jerker/0000-0003-3407-8618; 													1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2015	73	2			SI		663	680		10.1007/s12665-014-3106-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-014-3106-z													WOS:000347446400014

Therefore, understanding the response of NEC summer drought to global warming is of significance. In this study, based on observation and large-ensemble simulations of the Community Earth System Model (CESM-LE), the variabilities in summer extreme consecutive dry days (CDDs) over NEC are investigated in the present and future climate. In the observation, the NEC summer extreme CDDs showed an increasing trend during the past half century and experienced a significant interdecadal change around the middle 1990s, which is mainly due to the change in the anticyclone over Lake Baikal-Northeast Asia. The anticyclone-related anomalous downward motion and moisture divergence provided favorable conditions for increased summer CDDs over NEC. The CESM-LE multimember ensemble (MME) simulation could reproduce the change in NEC summer extreme CDDs and its related atmospheric circulations, indicating that the observed change in NEC summer extreme CDDs could be largely contributed by anthropogenic forcing. In the future warmer climate, the NEC summer extreme CDDs are projected to show interdecadal variability, which increase by approximately 6.7% in the early 21st century (2020-2030), then decrease by approximately 0.3% in the middle to late 21st century (2040-2080), and further increase by approximately 2.1% in the late 21st century (2085-2100). In addition, the projected changes in the anticyclone over Lake Baikal-Northeast Asia show a similar feature to that of the NEC summer extreme CDDs, which might further provide some confidence in the projection of the NEC summer extreme CDDs due to the physical connection between CDDs and anticyclone in the future.

J	Ridenour, GS				Ridenour, GS			The sensitivity of fluvial point-source models to hydraulic geometry, temperature, and discharge: Implications for hypoxia in large water bodies	PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												An approach to modeling a point source of BOD effluent is presented. This approach displays the seasonal variability of a range (bracket) of possible outcomes with regard to the magnitude and location of maximum oxygen deficit and remaining oxygen demand by using the hydraulic geometry, discharge, and water temperature at two gauging stations situated upstream (Gladewater) and downstream (Beckville) from a point source (Longview) in the Sabine River, Texas. A stepwise sensitivity analysis indicates the degree to which temporal and spatial variability of the fluvial input parameters affects oxygen demand where the river enters a reservoir (Toledo fend). Though the model produced a wide bracket (100 km) for the distance downstream at which maximum oxygen deficit occurred during the winter, the curves diverged at distances exceeding that to the reservoir. The fraction of oxygen-demanding waste that remained at the point of maximum deficit was relatively constant annually from Beckville (similar to 60% to 70%), but sinusoidal from Gladewater (similar to 40% to 90%). The curves for maximum oxygen deficit paralleled each other quite closely at deficits below 3 g/m(3) throughout most of the year but diverged sharply during July and August; this pattern was attributed to the difference in hydraulic geometry. The fraction of oxygen-demanding waste that remained in the river as it entered the reservoir was greatest in the winter and spring, with discharge being about twice as important as temperature in accounting for the difference.

Italy) was starred in 1995 to examine the effects of the zebra mussel colonization which began in early '90. Our results have been related to '91-92 data (pre-Dreissena period), before the maximum colonization of zebra mussel. In spring and summer of the post-Dreissena period fetal phosphorus, P-PO4(4), nitrate and chlorophyll values decreased while ammonium and transparency increased at every sampling station. Zebra mussel does not modify the trophic stale of this sub-basin but it plays an important role in nutrient cycling. The entire population can filter epilimnetic waters 2.1 times per year and can produce 2.9 x 10(4) t/y of pseudofaeces which are transferred to sediments.

In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of bacterioplankton and sedimentary bacteria community composition and assembly processes across multiple seasons in 18 outdoor mesocosms exposed to three temperature scenarios. Our findings reveal that warming and seasonal changes play a vital role in shaping microbial diversity, species interactions, and community assembly disparities in water and sediment ecosystems. We observed that the bacterioplankton networks were more fragile, potentially making them susceptible to disturbances, whereas sedimentary bacteria exhibited increased stability. Constant warming and heatwaves had contrasting effects: heatwaves increased stability in both planktonic and sedimentary bacteria communities, but planktonic bacterial networks became more fragile under constant warming. Regarding bacterial assembly, stochastic processes primarily influenced the composition of planktonic and sedimentary bacteria. Constant warming intensified the stochasticity of bacterioplankton year-round, while heatwaves caused a slight shift from stochastic to deterministic in spring and autumn. In contrast, sedimentary bacteria assembly is mainly dominated by drift and remained unaffected by warming. Our study enhances our understanding of how bacterioplankton and sedimentary bacteria communities respond to global warming across multiple seasons, shedding light on the complex dynamics of microbial ecosystems in lakes.					; Yan, Yifeng/LSI-7240-2024; zhang, huan/MSW-4327-2025; zhang, yan/KHC-3163-2024; Cheng, Haowu/KHV-4555-2024	Zhang, Peiyu/0000-0002-9551-3882; Cheng, Haowu/0000-0002-5464-3111; Huang, Jinhe/0009-0001-5038-5733; Feng, Mingjun/0000-0001-5050-5005														2076-2607				NOV	2023	11	11							2807	10.3390/microorganisms11112807	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms11112807								38004818					WOS:001113588200001

Luminescence dating of late pleistocene glacial and glacio-fluvial sediments in the Central Himalaya, India	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The late Quaternary glacier advances in the Himalayan orogen exhibit a complex interplay of insolation induced changes in summer monsoon and winter westerlies. However, the relative contributions of these moisture sources in driving the glacier advances in the Himalaya are still being debated. Additionally, uncertainties about the timing, and hence the processes, responsible for driving the penultimate Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in the Central Himalaya, still persist. The present study attempts to address some of these issues by employing detailed moraine stratigraphy supplemented with luminescence dating of three moraine and two relict lake sequences in the Kunti-Banar valley of the Central Himalaya, India. The study revealed that the penultimate glacier advance was significantly more extensive compared to its LGM counterpart. Stratigraphically and chronologically correlated sequences indicate that the penultimate glacial advance corresponded to the cool and dry Marine Isotope Stage 4 (MIS 4) and pluvial early to middle MIS 3. The restricted LGM glacier advance is dated to-23 +/- 4 ka; while the youngest glacial advance is dated to-16.6 +/- 0.4 ka and corresponds to the oldest Dryas (OD). Geomorphologically, the oldest Kunti-Banar glacier advance (KBGA)-I moraine was responsible for the obstruction of the meltwater stream leading to the formation of a proglacial lake around 30 +/- 3 ka. Similarly, the KBGA-II moraine is overlain by relict lake sediments, with an age range of-15 +/- 1 ka to present, implying that deglaciation has occurred prior to it. Evidence from the Dhauliganga valley resonates reasonably well with the pattern of glacier advances from Central Himalaya implying the influ-ence of mid-latitude, synoptic-scale climatic perturbations. Particularly, there seems to be a coupling between the enhanced mid-latitude westerlies and phases of glacier advance, whereas the deglaciation phases correspond to the insolation driven enhanced monsoon periods.

A SFS (Surface Flow Wetland) and/or a FWS (Subsurface Flow Wetland) CW was continuously operated in autumn and winter. The results were then compared and the factors to affect the results were examined. The results showed that, regarding the overall level of the system stability and the pollutants removal efficiency, SFS constructed wetland is better than the FWS wetland. The average removal efficiency of SFS wetland is 84.2% for COD, 53.8% for NH3-N, 47.9% for TN, 73.3% for TP and 86.6% for SS. It is noted that the NH3-N, TN removal rate is not high in single-stage wetlands. Therefore, some novel actions and other ecological processing technologies such as multi-stage wetland system, effluent recirculation etc should be introduced. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Bacterial and Archaeal Phylogenetic Diversity of a Cold Sulfur-Rich Spring on the Shoreline of Lake Erie, Michigan	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Studies of sulfidic springs have provided new insights into microbial metabolism, groundwater biogeochemistry, and geologic processes. We investigated Great Sulphur Spring on the western shore of Lake Erie and evaluated the phylogenetic affiliations of 189 bacterial and 77 archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences from three habitats: the spring origin (11-m depth), bacterial-algal mats on the spring pond surface, and whitish filamentous materials from the spring drain. Water from the spring origin water was cold, pH 6.3, and anoxic (H-2, 5.4 nM; CH4, 2.70 mu M) with concentrations of S2- (0.03 mM), SO42- (14.8 mM), Ca2- (15.7 mM), and HCO3- (4.1 mM) similar to those in groundwater from the local aquifer. No archaeal and few bacterial sequences were >95% similar to sequences of cultivated organisms. Bacterial sequences were largely affiliated with sulfur-metabolizing or chemolithotrophic taxa in Beta-, Gamma-, Delta-, and Epsilonproteobacteria. Epsilonproteobacteria sequences similar to those obtained from other sulfidic environments and a new clade of Cyanobacteria sequences were particularly abundant (16% and 40%, respectively) in the spring origin clone library. Crenarchaeota sequences associated with archaeal-bacterial consortia in whitish filaments at a German sulfidic spring were detected only in a similar habitat at Great Sulphur Spring. This study expands the geographic distribution of many uncultured Archaea and Bacteria sequences to the Laurentian Great Lakes, indicates possible roles for epsilonproteobacteria in local aquifer chemistry and karst formation, documents new oscillatorioid Cyanobacteria lineages, and shows that uncultured, cold-adapted Crenarchaeota sequences may comprise a significant part of the microbial community of some sulfidic environments.					; Marsh, Terence/LIC-2664-2024	Duris, Joseph/0000-0002-8669-8109; Marsh, Terence/0000-0002-7015-975X													0099-2240	1098-5336				AUG 1	2009	75	15					5025	5036		10.1128/AEM.00112-09	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00112-09								19542341					WOS:000268311600013

A series of models and indicators have been proposed to assess the trophic state of lakes. The trophic state index (TSI) is a synthetic index that integrates chlorophyll-a, water clarity, and total phosphorus and is widely used to evaluate the trophic state of aquatic environments. In this study, we collected in situ lake samples (N = 431) from typical lakes to match Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) imagery data using the Case 2 Regional Coast Color processor. Then we developed a new empirical model, TSI = -34.04 x (band 4/band 5) - 1.114 x (band 1/band 4) + 97.376). This model is valid for all of China, with good performance and few errors (RMSE = 7.36; MAE = 6.25) for the validation dataset. Recognizing that over 94% of the Chinese population located along eastern watersheds and large lakes have competing water uses, and given the TSI model on the seasonal scales, we further estimated the mean TSI and trophic state in eastern Chinese lakes (> 100 km(2)) from 2019 to 2020. The results revealed that more lakes were eutrophic in autumn (94.28%) than in spring (> 77.14%), indicating a serious eutrophication of eastern lakes. Although the eastern lakes have been studied in more detail, this study found that eutrophication still has markedly negative impacts on lake ecosystems. In addition, no significant improvement was observed in spring, most likely due to the months of curfew/lockdown from January 2020 onwards due to COVID-19. This may be due to the enrichment of nutrients deposited in sediment or watershed soil, which can be characterized as "autochthonous sources " of lake eutrophication, over decades with high rates of economic development. This study demonstrates the applicability of Sentinel-2 MSI data to monitor lake eutrophication as well as the feasibility of blue/red and red/red edge combinations. The framework and TSI model used bands available on MSI sensors to develop a novel approach for generating historical eutrophication data for large-scale evaluation of and decision-making related aquatic environmental changes, even in poorly studied areas.					chen, fangfang/HHC-2292-2022; Wang, Qiang/P-7806-2016; xu, shiqi/KEH-9943-2024; Li, Sijia/GPT-2594-2022														0022-1694	1879-2707				MAY	2022	608								127613	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.127613	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.127613		FEB 2022											WOS:000793192400002

Assessing potential winter weather response to climate change and implications for tourism in the U.S. Great Lakes and Midwest	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study Region: Eight U.S. states bordering the North American Laurentian Great Lakes. Study Focus: Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model simulations, based on data from an ensemble of atmospheric-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) used for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC's) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), were used to quantify potential climate change impacts on winter weather and hydrology in the study region and understand implications for its tourism sector. New Hydrologic Insights for the Region: By the 2080s, climate change could result in winters that are shorter by over a month, reductions of over a month in days with snow depths required for many kinds of winter recreation, declines in average holiday snow depths of 50 percent or more, and reductions in the percent area of the study region that would be considered viable for winter tourism from about 22 percent to 0.3 percent. Days with temperatures suitable for artificial snowmaking decline to less than a month annually, making it potentially less feasible as an adaptation strategy. All of the region's current ski resorts are operating in areas that will become non-viable for winter tourism businesses under a high emissions scenario. Given the economic importance of the winter tourism industry in the study region, businesses and communities should consider climate change and potential adaptation strategies in their future planning and overall decision-making.

Data-intensive machine learning models have been shown to be better able to reveal the nonlinear relationships between variables in the study of complex biotic community dynamics than traditional mechanistic models. In this study, we applied random forest models to long-term datasets from nutrient monitoring and meteorological observations to characterize the relationships between algal growth and different environmental drivers in three eutrophic lakes in China. We further attempted to estimate the season-specific nutrient thresholds in these lakes, and assess the potential decreases in chlorophyll a concentrations that could be achieved through nutrient management. In general, chlorophyll a concentrations predicted by the random forest models were consistent with the values observed in the lakes, and successfully displayed the same seasonal variations. The estimated total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) nutrient thresholds were quite variable among months, and were higher in summer than in winter. To maintain chlorophyll a concentrations below 20 mu g/L, the estimated TN thresholds in Lakes Taihu, Dianchi, and Chaohu in August were 2145 +/- 683, 2372 +/- 918 and 1527 +/- 71 mu g/L (mean +/- standard deviation), respectively, and the corresponding TP thresholds were 82 +/- 24, 149 +/- 22, and 120 +/- 22 mu g/L. The modelling results indicated that it was more important to control the TP concentrations in these lakes than the TN concentrations to control algal growth in summer. In summary, the strong seasonal variation in the estimated nutrient thresholds suggests that a 'one-sizefits-all' nutrient control target could overprotect these water bodies. Seasonal variation in nutrient concentrations and environmental drivers should thus be considered when establishing nutrient criteria and setting nutrient control targets.

J	Keevallik, S				Keevallik, Sirje			Shifts in meteorological regime of the late winter and early spring in Estonia during recent decades	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Wind, temperature and precipitation measurements at Vilsandi (the westernmost island of Estonia) and Tiirikoja (on the western coast of Lake Peipsi) collected during 1966-2005 were used to detect trends and regime shifts in monthly mean averages. A similar analysis was carried out for wind components in the free atmosphere calculated from aerological soundings. An abrupt increase in the upper-air zonal wind component around 1987 was detected in January and February over North-East Europe that may form a significant part of the intensification of the western flow. This increase is accompanied by a shift in the meteorological regime near the surface over a wider area. In March, the regime shift in the upper air flow that has taken place in the middle of the 1990s is not reflected in the meteorological parameters at the surface. Besides the regime shift at the end of the 1980s, also shifts in the middle of the 1970s and at the beginning of the 2000s are suggested.																			0177-798X	1434-4483				AUG	2011	105	1-2					209	215		10.1007/s00704-010-0356-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-010-0356-x													WOS:000293021500018

Amidst these uses, anthropogenic activities, especially urbanization and agriculture, continue to impair the functionality of springs. With the looming decadal climate change, freshwater springs could be a sustainable source of clean water for the realisation of Sustainable Development Goal 6. This paper presents the results of the sanitary inspection and assessment of limnochemical characteristics and quality of water samples (n = 64) from four freshwater springs (coded SPR1, SPR2, SPR3, and SPR4) in Kansanga, a flash flood-prone area in the African Great Lakes region of Uganda. Each sample was analysed for 17 parameters (temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, turbidity, fluorides, sulphates, chlorides, nitrates, orthophosphates, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, total alkalinity, potassium, sodium, total, magnesium and calcium hardness) following the standard methods. Water quality index (WQI) was calculated to establish the quality of the water samples based on the physicochemical parameters measured. Based on the sanitary risk assessment results, the springs had medium- to high-risk scores, but most water parameters were within the WHO guidelines for potable water, except for nitrates (in SPR1 and SPR2), hardness levels (in SPR2), and dissolved oxygen (in all the samples). Sampling season and location had significant effects on the limnochemistry of the freshwater springs (p < 0.05). The water quality indices calculated indicated that the water from the springs was of good quality (WQI = 50-57), but there was a reduction in water quality during the wet season. The best water quality was recorded in samples from SPR4, followed by those for SPR3, SPR1, and SPR2. These results provide insights into the contribution of floods and poor sanitation facilities to the deterioration of spring water quality in Kansanga, and the need to leverage additional conservation strategies to support vulnerable communities in the area. Further studies are required to establish the risk posed by trace metals and microbes that may contaminate freshwater in the studied springs, especially following flood events.					; Angiro, Christopher/AAL-9535-2020; OMARA, TIMOTHY/AAD-9009-2019; Gerald, kwikiriza/JDD-6043-2023; Omara, Timothy/AAD-9009-2019	Gerald, kwikiriza/0000-0002-4165-4516; Angiro, Christopher/0000-0001-6036-3389; Omara, Timothy/0000-0002-0175-1055														2079-9276				OCT	2024	13	10							133	10.3390/resources13100133	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/resources13100133													WOS:001343469300001
J	Bergström, AK; Faithfull, C; Karlsson, D; Karlsson, J				Bergstrom, Ann-Kristin; Faithfull, Carolyn; Karlsson, Daniel; Karlsson, Jan			Nitrogen deposition and warming - effects on phytoplankton nutrient limitation in subarctic lakes	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												The aim of this study was to predict the combined effects of enhanced nitrogen (N) deposition and warming on phytoplankton development in high latitude and mountain lakes. Consequently, we assessed, in a series of enclosure experiments, how lake water nutrient stoichiometry and phytoplankton nutrient limitation varied over the growing season in 11 lakes situated along an altitudinal/climate gradient with low N-deposition (<1kg Nha(-1)yr(-1)) in northern subarctic Sweden. Short-term bioassay experiments with N- and P-additions revealed that phytoplankton in high-alpine lakes were more prone to P-limitation, and with decreasing altitude became increasingly N- and NP-colimited. Nutrient limitation was additionally most obvious in midsummer. There was also a strong positive correlation between phytoplankton growth and water temperature in the bioassays. Although excess nutrients were available in spring and autumn, on these occasions growth was likely constrained by low water temperatures. These results imply that enhanced N-deposition over the Swedish mountain areas will, with the exception of high-alpine lakes, enhance biomass and drive phytoplankton from N- to P-limitation. However, if not accompanied by warming, N-input from deposition will stimulate limited phytoplankton growth due to low water temperatures during large parts of the growing season. Direct effects of warming, allowing increased metabolic rates and an extension of the growing season, seem equally crucial to synergistically enhance phytoplankton development in these lakes.

However, it may be delayed or lost due to climate change. The occurrence of water circulation is affected by climate and morphological factors of waterbodies. However, although the occurrence of winter circulation has been found to be controlled by the interplay of climatic and morphologic factors, empirical investigations of this interplay remain limited. Thus, we explored the prevalent role of the interaction between climatic and morphologic factors in the occurrence of winter circulation using up to 37 years of data from 22 deep (maximum depth > 20 m) reservoirs in Japan. We found a negative interaction between seasonal air temperature and water depth, indicating that the effect of the temperature condition of the preceding season declines at deeper water depths. Therefore, in line with previous findings regarding relatively shallow lakes, water depth changes the strength of air temperature effect on the occurrence of winter circulation in deep waterbodies. Furthermore, these results highlight the potential to promote winter circulation through water depth management and the importance of understanding patterns across multiple waterbodies to guide management interventions.

Influence of cold season climate variability on lakes and wetlands in the Great Lakes region	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The role of cold season climate variability on lakes and wetlands in the Great Lakes region of the United States was examined over a period of 91 years (1917-2007) using the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) land surface hydrologic model. Statistically significant trends in observed cold season precipitation and air temperature indicated that both have significantly increased during the last 91 years. Results also showed that despite the significant increase in the cold season (December-May) precipitation, snowfall is significantly decreased during the period 1917-2007, suggesting the change in the distribution of the cold season precipitation. Both total runoff and evapotranspiration during the spring (March-May) season are increased; however, the trend associated with evapotranspiration was significant. These changes in cold season precipitation and temperature resulted in an increasing trend in domain-averaged fractional inundation extent during the spring season. The inundation extent of lakes and wetlands during the spring season showed sensitivity to periods of extreme climate. Driest years and those with the lowest snowfall resulted in the lowest inundation extents, while years with highest snowfalls resulted in the greatest inundation extents. Five year composites of extreme dry; wet; cold; warm; low snow; high snow; low snow, high temperature; and high snow, low temperature showed the mean domain average fractional inundation extent in spring to be 0.17, 0.22, 0.23, 0.20, 0.17, 0.24, 0.21, and 0.22, respectively. The fractional inundation extent in spring was significantly correlated with snowfall, the amount of snowmelt in the cold season, and the total runoff (surface runoff + base flow) in spring. Spring inundation extent was negatively correlated with the cold season air temperature, suggesting that higher air temperature could lead to lower inundation.

Thomas			Phosphorus dynamics at multiple time scales in the pelagic zone of a large shallow lake in Florida, USA	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Symposium on the Eutrophication Process and Control in Large Shallow Lakes	APR 22-26, 2005	Nanjing, PEOPLES R CHINA					Phosphorus (P) dynamics in large shallow lakes are greatly influenced by physical processes such as wind-driven sediment resuspension, at times scales from hours to years. Results from long-term (30 year) research on Lake Okeechobee, Florida (area 1,730 km(2), mean depth 2.7 m) illustrate key features of these P dynamics. Variations in wind velocity result in changes in water column transparency, suspended solids, and total P (TP). In summer there are diurnal changes in TP associated with afternoon winds, and in winter, when strong winds occur for multiple days, monthly average TP remains high compared to summer. The magnitude of daily and seasonal TP changes can exceed 100 mu g l(-1). Hurricanes and tropical storms also cause extreme changes in TP that are superimposed on seasonal dynamics. When a hurricane passed 80 km south of the lake in October 1999, mean pelagic TP increased from 88 to 222 mu g l(-1). During large resuspension events, light attenuation is substantially increased, and this influences the biomass and spatial extent of submerged plants, as well as water column TP. In Lake Okeechobee, TP concentrations typically are 20 mu g l(-1)when submerged plants are dense, and soluble reactive P concentrations are reduced below detection, perhaps by the periphyton and plant uptake and by precipitation with calcium at high pH. In contrast, TP exceeds 50 mu g l(-1) when submerged plants and periphyton are absent due to prolonged deep water, and phytoplankton biomass and algal bloom frequency both are increased. In Lake Okeechobee and other large shallow lakes, complex models that explicitly consider wind-wave energy, hydrodynamics, and sediment resuspension, transport, and key biological processes are needed to accurately predict how lake water TP will respond to different management options.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2007	581						25	42		10.1007/s10750-006-0502-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0502-8													WOS:000244992800004
J	Chigbu, P; Sibley, TH				Chigbu, P; Sibley, TH			Feeding ecology of longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys Ayres) in Lake Washington	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Stomach contents of longfin smelt collected in Lake Washington, 1985-1991, were analyzed to assess feeding habits. Copepod species dominated prey biomass consumed by young of the year smelt in summer whereas Daphnia, chironomid larvae, and copepod species were the most important prey in fall. Diet of 1+ smelt, expressed in terms of percent dry weight, consisted mainly of mysids, amphipods, and Daphnia. The mean number of mysids observed in smelt stomachs in this study was about 50% lower than in the 1960s. This change in smelt diet is related to changes that have occurred in the Lake Washington watershed, and in the zooplankton composition in the lake following recovery from eutrophication; a reduction in growth of smelt accompanied this.

In contrast, striped bass, Morone saxatilis, that have been introduced to Lake Texoma (Oklahoma-Texas, U.S.A.) use a very limited array of fish (mostly clupeids of the genus Dorosoma) as prey. As a large, mobile predator, M. saxatilis should be capable of capturing and consuming numerous other species of fish that are available in the reservoir. However, examination of 1845 stomachs year-around over 5 years showed that the only marked ''switching'' among prey was from Dorosoma to a diet including a high percentage of insects during spring-early summer, ignoring most other fish taxa that could have served as food. Even under essentially starvation conditions in late summer of years with scarce Dorosoma, M. saxatilis in Lake Texoma did not switch to other available fish as prey. Patterns of predation by M. saxatilis are trenchantly different from place to place: very narrow prey selectivity even under starvation conditions has been reported once previously for the species in a freshwater reservoir, but in its native marine and estuarine environment and in some other reservoirs the species is more catholic in its use of prey. Why this large predator shows fidelity in some environments to particular prey, even to the extent of starvation, remains an enigma.																			0022-1112	1095-8649				AUG	1988	33	2					273	288		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1988.tb05470.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1988.tb05470.x													WOS:A1988P699000011

Water level treatments may affect its overwintering and regrowth capability during warming winter. To test this hypothesis, an experiment was conducted to analyze the effects of different water levels on the survival rates and regrowth of E. crassipes under experimental warm winter conditions. Three water levels were set up including drawdown with rooted, shallow submergence with rooted and floating. Regrowth characters including number of ramets, Fv/Fm, biomass and biomass allocation were surveyed. The results showed that warming significantly increased survival, ramet numbers and the biomass of plants. Warming also significantly increased Fv/Fm in drawdown plants. Water level only impacted plants under warming conditions. Compared to floating plants, drawdown significantly decreased survival but increased total biomass, while submergence led to 100 % survival, significantly higher ramet numbers and increased total biomass. In terms of biomass allocation, the effects of warming were similar for drawdown and submergence cases; it resulted in increased shoot biomass allocation and a lower root mass ratio. Warming only significantly increased the stem mass ratio of floating plants. Our findings suggested that warming help E. crassipes successfully overwinter and regrow during the next growing season. Drawdown or shallow submergence cannot effectively control this species but rather promotes its regrowth during warm winters. Thus, this species has the potential to spread with warm winters and frequent water level fluctuations caused by future climate change.

J	Quan, RC; Cui, LW				Quan, Ruichang; Cui, Liangwei			Winter pairs of ruddy shelducks at Lashihai Lake, southwest China	INTEGRATIVE ZOOLOGY												It has been suggested that pairing behavior during winter in migratory ducks represents a trade-off between costs (defense of the female) and benefits (early access to females). To investigate the benefits and costs for both sexes in wintering pairs of ruddy shelducks (Tadorna ferruginea), we compared time budgets for paired males and females, and surveyed the sex ratio of the birds wintering at Lashihai Lake, southwest China. The behavior of the paired ruddy shelducks was monitored for 5 activity types: feeding, resting (including sleeping), preening, drinking and warning. Feeding was the most dominant activity. The feeding time of both sexes increased as the winter season progressed. However, the paired females always spent significantly more time feeding and less time warning than the paired males. Paired ruddy shelducks had access to better feeding grounds than unpaired individuals, resulting in a food benefit for paired individuals over single individuals. Because the sex ratio of the wintering population was strongly male biased (M:F = 1.44:1.00), the paired male also gained the benefit of accessing a female in advance of the breeding season.

Phytoplankton productivity across prairie saline lakes of the Great Plains (USA): a step toward deciphering patterns through lake classification models	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We investigated patterns of primary production across prairie saline lakes in the central and northern Great Plains of the United States. Based on comparative lake sampling in 2004, seasonal predictors of algal primary productivity were identified within subsets of similar lakes using a combination of Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and classification and regression trees (CART). These models indicated complex patterns of nutrient limitation by nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and iron (Fe) within different lake groups. Nutrient enrichment assays (control, + Fe, + N, + P, + N + P) were performed in spring and summer of 2006 to determine if phytoplankton in selected lakes followed predicted patterns of nutrient limitation. Both the comparative lake sampling and experimental results indicated that N limitation was widespread in these prairie lakes, with evidence for secondary P limitation in certain lakes. In the experiments, iron did not stimulate primary production. Our results suggest that given the diverse geochemical nature of these lakes, classification models that separate saline lakes into subsets may be an effective method for improving predictions of algal production.					; Osburn, Chris/A-9339-2010	Osburn, Christopher/0000-0002-9334-4202; 													0706-652X					SEP	2009	66	9					1435	1448		10.1139/F09-083	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F09-083													WOS:000269834500005

W.			A multi-proxy approach for revealing recent climatic changes in the Russian Altai	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												For the first time we present a multi-proxy data set for the Russian Altai, consisting of Siberian larch tree-ring width (TRW), latewood density (MXD), delta C-13 and delta O-18 in cellulose chronologies obtained for the period 1779-2007 and cell wall thickness (CWT) for 1900-2008. All of these parameters agree well between each other in the high-frequency variability, while the low-frequency climate information shows systematic differences. The correlation analysis with temperature and precipitation data from the closest weather station and gridded data revealed that annual TRW, MXD, CWT, and delta C-13 data contain a strong summer temperature signal, while delta O-18 in cellulose represents a mixed summer and winter temperature and precipitation signal. The temperature and precipitation reconstructions from the Belukha ice core and Teletskoe lake sediments were used to investigate the correspondence of different independent proxies. Low frequency patterns in TRW and delta C-13 chronologies are consistent with temperature reconstructions from nearby Belukha ice core and Teletskoe lake sediments showing a pronounced warming trend in the last century. Their combination could be used for the regional temperature reconstruction. The long-term delta O-18 trend agrees with the precipitation reconstruction from the Teletskoe lake sediment indicating more humid conditions during the twentieth century. Therefore, these two proxies could be combined for the precipitation reconstruction.

The concentration of CDOM, determined by its absorption coefficient at wavelength lambda = 380 nm, ranged from 4.17 to 22.3 m(-1) in Peipsi, from 3.96 to 15.7 m(-1) in Vortsjarv and from 2.24 to 32.9 m(-1) in Parnu Bay. The amount of CDOM was spatially variable in all investigated waterbodies. It was highest in the coastal/onshore areas and in the estuaries of the main rivers. It usually decreased from spring towards autumn, and the seasonal patterns were most distinct in the onshore areas. In standing water bodies, the short-term dynamics of discharges had a more significant effect on CDOM concentration in onshore areas than in offshore areas, where the influence of the discharges became visible over a longer period. The results suggest that in large and shallow water bodies the share of the allochthonous component in the CDOM pool decreases towards offshore areas. The impact of CDOM discharged into the inflowing rivers reaches further from shores if the ratio of the catchment area to the volume of the standing water body (C/V) is larger. The influence of precipitation on CDOM absorption proved to be insignificant.					; Noges, Tiina/AAL-5373-2020; Laas, Alo/G-7992-2016	Toming, Kaire/0000-0001-5190-2459; Laas, Alo/0000-0002-4801-0377													1239-6095	1797-2469				DEC 18	2009	14	6					959	970																WOS:000273108200005

Sewage treatment plants (STPs) are an important source of these contaminants, but few data exist on the spatial distribution of drugs in surface waters near STPs. Samples of surface water were collected in the summer and fall of 2000 at open-water sites in the lower Great Lakes (Lake Ontario and Lake Erie), at sites near the two STPs for the city of Windsor (ON, Canada), and at sites in Hamilton Harbour (ON. Canada), an embayment of western Lake Ontario that receives discharges from several STPs. In a follow-up study in the summer of 2002. samples of surface water and final effluent from adjacent STPs were collected from sites in Hamilton Harbour and Windsor. In addition, surface water and STP effluent samples were collected in Peterborough (ON, Canada). All samples of surface water and STP effluents were analyzed for selected acidic and neutral drugs. In the survey of Hamilton Harbour and Windsor conducted in 2000, acidic drugs and the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine were detected at ng/L concentrations at sites that were up to 500 in away from the STP, but the hydrological conditions of the receiving waters strongly influenced the spatial distribution of these compounds. Drugs were not detected at open-water locations in western Lake Erie or in the Niagara River near the municipality of Niagara-on-the-Lake (ON, Canada). However, clofibric acid, ketoprofen, fenoprofen, and carbamazepine were detected in samples collected in the summer of 2000 at sites in Lake Ontario and at a site in the Niagara River (Fort Erie, ON. Canada) that were relatively remote from STP discharges. Follow-up studies in the summer of 2002 indicated that concentrations of acidic and neutral drugs in surface waters near the point of sewage discharge into the Little River (ON, Canada) STP were approximately equal to the concentrations in the final effluent from the STP. Caffeine and cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine. were generally present in STP effluents and surface waters contaminated by drugs. The antidepressant fluoxetine and the antibiotic trimethoprom were also detected in most STP effluents and some surface water samples. For the first time, the lipid regulating drug atorvastatin was detected in samples of STP effluent and surface water.																			0730-7268	1552-8618				DEC	2003	22	12					2881	2889		10.1897/02-627	http://dx.doi.org/10.1897/02-627								14713027					WOS:000186959100007

Improving knowledge of the changing characteristics of RE and ED and their response to extreme precipitation is critical for risk assessment of soil erosion and for agricultural management. This study extended previous studies at the basin scale and investigated the temporal and spatial patterns of RE and ED in the Poyang Lake basin, China, and focused on their response to changes in extreme precipitation from 1960 to 2012. The results showed that nearly 80% of the annual RE was concentrated in summer and spring, and the highest ED also occurred during the same period. Summer was the most vulnerable season for potential soil erosion in the Poyang Lake basin. This was principally associated with the characteristics of precipitation in the different seasons. A trend analysis showed clear long-term positive changes in seasonal RE and ED during the study period.The risk of soil erosion in terms of RE and ED in the basin became increasingly higher than before. Spatially, the large RE and ED values were mainly found in the northeast of the basin. These trends and spatial patterns of RE and ED were primarily attributed to the intensification of extreme precipitation in the northeast of the Poyang Lake basin. These findings indicated that considering the strong role of extreme precipitation is essential for the soil erosion control, land management, and agricultural production in the Poyang Lake basin, as well as in other areas.

J	Jones, B; Renaut, RW; Rosen, MR				Jones, B; Renaut, RW; Rosen, MR			Trigonal dendritic calcite crystals forming from hot spring waters at Waikite, North Island, New Zealand	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												Amorphous silica and calcite form the deposits in the vent and on the discharge apron of Waikite Spring 100 (WS-100), which is located in the Waikite Geothermal area an North bland, New Zealand, These precipitates formed from spring water that has a temperature of >90 degrees C and a pH of 8.1-8.8. The opaline silica is restricted to areas around the vent where cooling and evaporation of the spring water triggered precipitation. The calcite deposits in the spring vent and on the discharge apron are formed of large (up to 15 cm long) asymmetrical dendrite crystals that are characterized by multiple levels of branching. Branches grew preferentially from the downflow side of their parent branch. All branches have a trigonal transverse cross section except in areas where competition for growth space induced merger of neighboring crystals. The primary branches of the dendrite crystals are (sub)perpendicular to the substrate even in areas where the discharge apron slopes at a high angle (up to 80 degrees). On the steeper parts of the discharge apron, the plate-like primary branches form the floors of the small terrace pools whereas their distal edges form the rims of the pools. Growth of these dendrite crystals is attributed to abiotic processes. High levels of saturation with respect to calcite were caused by rapid CO2 degassing of the sheets of spring water that flowed down the steep discharge apron. Calcite crystals with different crystal morphologies characterize other springs near this spring. The variation in crystal morphologies from spring to spring is attributed to different levels of saturation that are related to the initial PCO2 of the spring water upon discharge and the rate of CO2 degassing at each spring.

J	Shiraki, S				Shiraki, S			Foraging habitats of Steller's Sea-Eagles during the wintering season in Hokkaido, Japan	JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH												Steller's Sea-Eagles (Haliaeetus pelagicus) winter mostly in Hokkaido, Japan. To clarify the temporal changes in foraging habitats used by the eagles throughout the wintering season, and factors affecting their choices of foraging habitats, I surveyed numbers of wintering eagles at 71 sites classified into five foraging habitat types (river basins, river estuaries, lakes or inland bays, coasts, and refuse dumps) from November to April 1991-92, and temporal changes in the food resource abundance at the major feeding sites. Most eagles were observed in river basins during November and December and the number of eagles fluctuated with temporal changes in the number of salmon carcasses in the Syokotsu River. The eagles appeared to move among rivers according to the abundance of available salmon. In mid-February and early March, the eagles were observed in various habitats but not at river basins. The distribution of eagles was affected by fishery activities on coasts, in lakes, and on inland bays during these periods. Estuaries, lakes, and inland bays maintained open water areas in the ice and appeared to be important feeding sites throughout the winter. On Furen Lake, the numbers of eagles did not fluctuate with temporal changes in the amount of feed fisheries discarded. It was possible that eagles stayed at Furen Lake even when the abundance of available small fish did not meet their food requirements and indicate that there not currently sufficient, suitable natural foraging habitats on the wintering grounds in Hokkaido during severe winters to maintain the current population of Steller's Sea-Eagles.																			0892-1016	2162-4569				JUN	2001	35	2					91	97																WOS:000169919400002
J	HU, SXS; TESSIER, AJ				HU, SXS; TESSIER, AJ			SEASONAL SUCCESSION AND THE STRENGTH OF INTRASPECIFIC AND INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION IN A DAPHNIA ASSEMBLAGE	ECOLOGY												Species of the genus Daphnia are generalized filter-feeders and potentially strong competitors, yet several species often coexist in the open waters of lakes. We investigated the population dynamics and competitive interactions of two Daphnia species in Gull Lake, Michigan. In each of 3 yr D. pulicaria was always common, while D. galeata mendotae became abundant only in late summer. The summer invasion of D. galeata mendotae was associated with a decline in abundance of D. pulicaria in some, but not all years. Decline of D. pulicaria was strongly predicted by the loss of oxygen from deep water during summer, which resulted in greater spatial overlap between the species, and by changes in the quality of the phytoplankton resources. We employed in situ enclosures to manipulate the density of each species and quantify the intensity of intra- and interspecific competition. Repeated competition experiments demonstrated that the relative exploitative ability of the species reversed from early to late summer. Strong interspecific competition was often observed, but its strength varied with juvenile or adult stage, and with season. Daphnia pulicaria juveniles were always affected strongly by interspecific effects: while D. galeata mendotae juveniles were impacted largely by intraspecific effects. The relative strength of intra- and interspecific competition on adults reversed from early to late summer for each species. The magnitude of intra- and interspecific effects on D. pulicaria adults was similar during early summer, but by late summer interspecific effects were much stronger than intraspecific effects. The reverse was true for D. galeata mendotae adults; interspecific effects greatly decreased in late summer. This seasonal shift in the nature of competitive interactions provides an explanation for seasonal succession in this Daphnia assemblage.																			0012-9658					OCT	1995	76	7					2278	2294		10.2307/1941702	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1941702													WOS:A1995RX36200028
J	Kampf, SK; Tyler, SW; Ortiz, CA; Munoz, JF; Adkins, PL				Kampf, SK; Tyler, SW; Ortiz, CA; Munoz, JF; Adkins, PL			Evaporation and land surface energy budget at the Salar de Atacama, Northern Chile	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Playa systems are driven by evaporation processes, yet the mechanisms by which evaporation occurs through playa salt crusts are still poorly understood. In this study we examine playa evaporation as it relates to land surface energy fluxes, salt crust characteristics, groundwater and climate at the Salar de Atacama, a 3000 km(2) playa in northern Chile containing a uniquely broad range of salt crust types. Land surface energy budget measurements were taken at eight representative sites on this playa during winter (August 2001) and summer (January 2002) seasons. Measured values of net all-wave radiation were highest at vegetated and rough halite crust sites and lowest over smooth, highly reflective salt crusts. Over most of the Salar de Atacama, net radiation was dissipated by means of soil and sensible heat fluxes. Dry salt crusts tended to heat and cool very quickly, whereas soil heating and cooling occurred more gradually at wetter vegetated sites. Sensible heating was strongly linked to wind patterns, with highest sensible heat fluxes occurring on summer days with strong afternoon winds. Very little energy available at the land surface was used to evaporate water. Eddy covariance measurements could only constrain evaporation rates to within 0.1 mm d(-1), and some measured evaporation rates were less than this margin of uncertainty. Evaporation rates ranged from 0.1 to 1.1 mm d(-1) in smooth salt crusts around the margin of the salar and from 0.4 to 2.8 mm d(-1) in vegetated areas. No evaporation was detected from the rugged halite salt crust that covers the interior of the salar, though the depth to groundwater is less than 1 m in this area. These crusts therefore represent a previously unrecorded end member condition in which the salt crusts form a practically impermeable barrier to evaporation. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study is to highlight annual and interannual patterns of Mougeotia biomass in the studied lakes and select key environmental parameters that may favour and maintain its mass development. Our results confirm former studies that planktic Mougeotia favours meso-oligotrophic conditions and becomes dominant when annual mean total phosphorus concentrations in the epilimnion fall below 20 A mu g l(-1). This triggering factor has effect with interactions of other environmental circumstances such as the water column stability. Physiological and morphological features of the taxon make it a successful competitor under stratified conditions. Results also showed that in three out of the four studied lakes, the annual peak was higher when the annual population development started earlier. Focusing on Lake Geneva, depth and strength of the thermocline, as well as wind speed in the beginning of summer that can cause nutrient replenishment and mix the epilimnion are key factors in the blooming of the taxon.

Biological methane oxidation can significantly mitigate such CH4 emissions, but despite favorable CH4 and O-2 concentrations, CH4 oxidation appears constrained in some lakes for unknown reasons. Here we experimentally test the hypothesis that phosphorus (P) availability is limiting CH4 oxidation, resulting in differences in ice-out emissions among lakes. We observed a positive relationship between potential CH4 oxidation and P concentration across 12 studied lakes and found an increase in CH4 oxidation in response to P amendment, without any parallel change in the methanotrophic community composition. Hence, while an increase in sedimentary CH4 production and ebullitive emissions may happen with eutrophication, our study indicates that the increase in P associated with eutrophication may also enhance CH4 oxidation. The increase in CH4 oxidation may hence play an important role in nutrient-rich ice-covered lakes where bubbles trapped under the ice may to a greater extent be oxidized, reducing the ice-out emissions of CH4. This may be an important factor regulating CH4 emissions from high latitude lakes.					; Oliveira Sawakuchi, Henrique/ABA-9796-2021; Oliveira Sawakuchi, Henrique/K-6194-2014	Karlsson, Jan/0000-0001-5730-0694; Peura, Sari/0000-0003-3892-8157; Bastviken, David/0000-0003-0038-2152; Martin, Gaetan/0000-0002-5289-6131; Oliveira Sawakuchi, Henrique/0000-0002-6815-7261													2169-8953	2169-8961				SEP	2021	126	9							e2020JG006190	10.1029/2020JG006190	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JG006190													WOS:000703067000032

Spatial and temporal patterns of urea content in a eutrophic stream continuum on the Northern Great Plains	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Urea can degrade water quality and stimulate toxic phytoplankton in P-rich lakes, yet little is known of its sources, abundance, or transportation in lotic systems, particularly within the Northern Great Plains. We measured physico-chemical parameters biweekly during May-September 2010-2012 at 16 stations along a 250 km lotic continuum to quantify spatial and temporal variation in urea concentrations and discharge, and to identify potential regulatory processes. Urea concentrations were similar to those in regional prairie lakes (range 5.2-792.1, median 78.6 mu g N L-1) with variable seasonal mean (+/- SD) concentrations (96.6 +/- 96.1 mu g N L-1) and fluxes (4.22 x 10(5) +/- 257.6 mu g N s(-1)). Landscape analysis with generalized additive models explained 68.3% of deviance in urea concentrations, with high temporal variability predicted mainly by positive relationships with nutrient content and chlorophyte abundance, but not temperature, dissolved organic matter, bacterial abundance, or urban effluent. Seasonal analysis revealed that during spring, urea content was correlated negatively with leguminous forage cover (% area) and positively with stream discharge, oilseed and cereal crops, and shrubs or deciduous plants, while during summer, urea concentrations were correlated negatively with discharge and leguminous crop cover, as well as nutrient levels. Mean porewater urea concentrations (528.5 +/- 229.8 mu g N L-1) were over five-fold greater than stream concentrations, suggesting that hyporheic production may offset declining influx from terrestrial sources during summer. We conclude that urea may be ubiquitous in eutrophic prairie streams and that management of its export from land may reduce detrimental effects on downstream lakes.

J	White, HL; Schmitt, FO				White, HL; Schmitt, FO			The site of reabsorption in the kidney tubule of Necturus	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY												Necturus maculosus was chosen as most suitable for capsular and tubular catheterization because of the large size and superficial situation of the primary glomerular capsules and because of the accessibility and size of the tubules from these capsules. Sugar is present in protein-free fluid drawn from the glomerular capsules of spring Necturi. The blood sugar is about 60 mgm. per 100 cc. The bladder urine is sugar-free, as is fluid drawn from points 1/2 or even 1/3 the way down the proximal convoluted tubule. Fall and early winter animals usually have no blood-sugar, and the bladder urine, proximal tubular fluid and capsular fluid are all sugar-free. If the plasma sugar level is raised to 40-50 mgm. per 100 cc. by a subcutaneous injection of 2 cc. of 1% glucose, the capsular fluid contains sugar while the bladder urine and proximal tubular fluid are sugar-free. The site of sugar reabsorption is thus localized in the proximal convoluted tubule. There are 360-400 mgm. NaCl per 100 cc. of plasma in this form. Capsular fluid gives a heavy precipitate with AgNO3, while fluid from the distal end of the proximal tubule shows only a light cloud. Further evidence that the proximal tubule is the principal site of reabsorption of osmotically active substances is afforded by the observation that dog red cells stained with methylene blue, which lake in 0.2% NaCl, when injected into a glomerular capsule never lake in the capsular fluid but almost immediately disappear when they are washed down into the proximal tubule as filtration proceeds. Cells fixed in formalin are easily seen throughout the entire tubular system. The site of chloride reabsorption is thus also seen to be in the proximal convoluted tubule. There are only 17-26 mgm. NaCl per 100 cc. of urine.																			0002-9513					APR	1926	76	2					483	495		10.1152/ajplegacy.1926.76.2.483	http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajplegacy.1926.76.2.483													WOS:000202417700022

This study was designed to evaluate the concentrations, loadings, and distribution of PACs in springtime snowpack and how they have changed since the first study in 2008. Snowpack samples were collected in late winters 2011-2014 at varying distances from the main developments. PAC concentration and deposition declined exponentially with distance, with pyrenes, chrysenes, and dibenzothiophenes dominating the distribution within the first 50 km. The distribution of PACs was different between sites located close to upgraders and others located close to mining facilities. Overall, PAC loadings were correlated with priority pollutant elements and water chemistry parameters, while wind direction and speed were not strong contributors to the variability observed. Total PAC mass deposition during winter months and within the first 50 km was initially estimated by integrating the exponential decay function fitted through the data using a limited number of sites from 2011 to 2014: 1236 kg (2011), 1800 kg (2012), 814 kg (2013), and 1367 (2014). Total loadings were estimated to have a twofold increase between 2008 and 2014, although the increase observed was not constant. Finally, kriging interpolation is presented as an alternative and more robust approach to estimate PAC mass deposition in the area. After a more intensive sampling campaign in 2014, the PAC mass deposition was estimated to be 1968 kg.

J	Jia, Q; Wang, X; Zhang, Y; Cao, L; Fox, AD				Jia, Qiang; Wang, Xin; Zhang, Yong; Cao, Lei; Fox, Anthony David			Drivers of waterbird communities and their declines on Yangtze River floodplain lakes	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												The seasonally flooded Yangtze Valley Floodplain wetlands of China are globally important for wintering waterbirds in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. These birds have declined in the last 60 years, so understanding factors shaping waterbird distribution and abundance patterns is critical for their conservation. We applied linear mixed models to investigate the effects of climate, winter water area and inundation area (the difference between maximum flooded and winter dry season water area) on waterbird abundance and diversity at 72 lakes in 2005 and 2016. Neither winter water area nor climate featured in the best models, rather inundation area was the key determinant of waterbird abundance and diversity. Future water abstraction and land claim will therefore have greater impacts on waterbird abundance and diversity than likely climate change effects. Significant declines in waterbird abundance and diversity between 2005 and 2016 were not explained by modelled variables and there was no reduction in wetland inundation areas to explain these declines, confirming other factors were responsible. These potentially include declining wetland quality affecting carrying capacity (e.g. flooding phenology, disturbance, habitat loss and degradation, declining water quality caused by eutrophication and pollution) and/or factors limiting migratory waterbird populations at other stages in their life cycle elsewhere. The studied Yangtze lakes are amongst the best for wintering waterbirds and many are protected for their biodiversity, suggesting such protection cannot fully safeguard these internationally shared populations when threatened by other, currently unknown factors. This confirms the urgent need for more research to safeguard these ephemeral lake systems for their global biodiversity significance.

J	Wang, CF; Wang, XP; Gong, P; Yao, TD				Wang, Chuanfei; Wang, Xiaoping; Gong, Ping; Yao, Tandong			Long-term trends of atmospheric organochlorine pollutants and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons over the southeastern Tibetan Plateau	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Long-term monitoring in remote regions is essential for revealing pollution trends at the global scale but relevant studies remain limited. In the present study, a six-year continuous monitoring of atmospheric persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was carried out at Lulang in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP). Average concentrations of hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and PAHs were 13.5, 8.9, 41.7, 1.8 pg/m(3)and 6.2 ng/m(3), respectively. Obvious seasonality was found for all the target compounds. HCHs, DDTs and PCBs had their highest concentrations in summer (monsoon season) and lowest in winter, which is consistent with the fluctuation of the Indian monsoon. Meanwhile, HCB and 5-6-ring PAHs showed opposite variations, possibly induced by local sources and the westerly flow in winter. Declining trends were observed for most of the chemicals, except o,p'-DDE, HCB and PCBs. A declining trend in the alpha/gamma-HCH ratio indicated a shift from technical HCHs to lindane. An increasing trend in the o,p'/p,p'-DDT ratio suggested a likely shift from technical DDTs to dicofol. For PAHs, the contribution from high-temperature combustion has increased recently. The half-lives of alpha-HCH, gamma-HCH, o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDT were 6.1, 108, 77.6 and 14.2years, respectively. The half-lives of gamma-HCH, o,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDT were higher than those in the Arctic, indicating these compounds will persist in the TP for a longer period. The temporal trends in atmospheric POPs were possibly induced by emissions in India and likely driven by wind speed in Lulang. This study contributes toward a better understanding of the behavior and transport of POPs in the TP region. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, blooms occurred again in 2016 and 2017 despite apparent low phosphorus concentrations in surface waters of the lake. We have attempted to explain the reasons for this come back in order to develop scenarios helpful to stakeholders who are concerned such proliferations may occur in the future. We show that phosphorus input, both from the main tributaries to the lake and possibly from the sediments, were likely the triggers of the new development of the cyanobacterium provided a minimum autumn/winter inoculum of P. rubescens was detected the year before. The subsequent bloom was observed deeper than previous years and associated with a conjunction of factors known to favour the development of this species (i.e., mild winter temperature, water column stability, available light at depth, surface water transparency, low predation, etc.). Although many factors and processes could account for the occurrence and bloom of the cyanobacterium, a plausible scenario is proposed. One thing remains unclear: where does this cyanobacterium "hide" when it is not observed during the routine monitoring surveys and from which place it could initiate its development (nearshore, the pelagic zone, or from the sediment?). Determining the factors responsible for cyanobacterial blooms is a key issue for scientists and lake stakeholders. This article provides a complete explanation for a recent bloom of Planktothrix rubescens that occurred in Lake Bourget (France) accompanied by a plausible scenario, likely to be used as a predictive tool in the future.

Seasonal patterns of predation on juvenile Pacific salmon by anadromous cutthroat trout in Puget Sound	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												In the marine environment, Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. suffer the greatest natural losses during early marine residence, and predation is hypothesized to be the key source of mortality during this life history stage. In the face of recent declines in Puget Sound salmon populations, our goal was to determine the extent of predation mortality on salmon during early marine life. In spring and summer of 2001-2003, we caught juvenile salmon and potential predators at nearshore areas in northern and southern regions of Puget Sound, Washington. We focused on the potential predation impact of coastal cutthroat trout O. clarkii clarkii, which were caught in low but consistent numbers in both regions and were the most abundant large-bodied potential predators of juvenile salmon in our catches. Cutthroat trout consumed a diverse and dynamic array of diet items and became increasingly piscivorous with increasing fork length above 140 mm. Cutthroat trout consumed a greater biomass of Pacific herring Clupea pallasii than any other prey fish species, but juvenile salmon were particularly important prey between April and June, making up greater than 50% of the fish prey consumed. Cutthroat trout exhibited size-selective predation, eating salmon that were smaller than the average size of conspecific prey available in the environment. For a hypothetical size-structured population of 1,000 cutthroat trout, pink salmon O. gorbuscha and chum salmon O. keta contributed the greatest number of salmon to the diet but Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha contributed the greatest salmonid biomass. On an order-of-magnitude basis, these predation estimates represented a relatively minor amount of early marine mortality for Chinook salmon and lower rates for the other salmon species. Conversely, juvenile salmon contributed significantly to the spring energy budget for cutthroat trout in Puget Sound.																			0002-8487					JAN	2008	137	1					165	181		10.1577/T07-049.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T07-049.1													WOS:000254039600014
J	Levy, LB; Kaufman, DS; Werner, A				Levy, LB; Kaufman, DS; Werner, A			Holocene glacier fluctuations, Waskey Lake, northeastern Ahklun Mountains, southwestern Alaska	HOLOCENE												Lake sediments from Waskey Lake, Ahklun Mountains, southwestern Alaska were studied to decipher the history of upvalley glacier fluctuations during the Holocene. Several indicators of glacier activity were measured including: magnetic susceptibility, organic-matter content, grain-size distribution, bulk-sediment mineralogy and diatom assemblages. Seven radiocarbon ages on macrofossils, along with cross-checks by tephrochronology, provide the chronology of the cores. The results from core WL-1 indicate that glaciers lingered near Waskey Lake until 9100 cal. yr BP, perhaps under conditions of high winter accumulation. Peak organic-matter content occurs at 7400 cal. yr BP, when precipitation might have shifted to summer. The onset of Neoglaciation occurred 3100 cal. yr BP, and glaciers reached their maximum extent similar to700 cal. yr BP. This chronology is consistent with the lichenometrically dated moraines from the glacier forefields. Although the ages are tentative, the youngest and most widespread group of moraines was deposited sometime between 650 and 200 cal. yr BP (during the 'Little Ice Age'). Since then, glaciers in the Waskey Lake area have shrunk by similar to50% and equilibrium-line altitudes (ELA) have risen by 35 +/- 22 m. This rise in ELA is much less than the 100 to 200 m rise observed elsewhere in Alaska and indicates considerable spatial variability in late-Holocene climatic change.

The treatment and supply of drinking water in Rwanda are carried out by Water and Sanitation Corporation, a state-owned public company. However, it is not able to supply water to all households. Consequently, the non-serviced households depend on natural water sources, like springs, to meet their water requirements. Nevertheless, the water quality in these springs is scarcely known. Therefore, this study assessed and compared metal elements in drinking water sources in the dry and rainy seasons in 2017 using the contamination degree, metal index, and geographic information systems to reveal the spatial distribution of water quality within the considered water sources of springs in Rwanda. The samples were collected monthly from nine water sources of springs and the measured elements are aluminium, calcium, copper, iron, manganese, and zinc. The metal index indicated that during the dry season and rainy season, the sites of Kibungo (1.10 and 1.26) and Kinigi (1.01 and 1.54) have assessed a metal index which is higher than 1. Thus, the water quality of those sites was getting the threshold of warning. The analysis indicated that pollutants are easily transported into water bodies during the rainy season in urban and rural areas to a greater extent than during the dry season .

However, some regional evidence is controversial and contradictory, and issues remain regarding timing, progression, and regional articulation of this event. In this paper, we review the evidence from selected proxies (sea-surface temperature, precipitation, and temperature reconstructed from pollen, delta O-18 on speleothems, and delta O-18 on lacustrine carbonate) over the Mediterranean Basin to infer possible regional climate patterns during the interval between 4.3 and 3.8 ka. The values and limitations of these proxies are discussed, and their potential for furnishing information on seasonality is also explored. Despite the chronological uncertainties, which are the main limitations for disentangling details of the climatic conditions, the data suggest that winter over the Mediterranean involved drier conditions, in addition to already dry summers. However, some exceptions to this prevail - where wetter conditions seem to have persisted - suggesting regional heterogeneity in climate patterns. Temperature data, even if sparse, also suggest a cooling anomaly, even if this is not uniform. The most common paradigm to interpret the precipitation regime in the Mediterranean - a North Atlantic Oscillation-like pattern - is not completely satisfactory to interpret the selected data.

J	Brkic, Z; Larva, O				Brkic, Zeljka; Larva, Ozren			Impact of climate change on the Vrana Lake surface water temperature in Croatia using support vector regression	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: The case study presents Vrana Lake on Cres island in Croatia, which is the largest freshwater resource on the Mediterranean islands. It is used for the public water supply of the residents and tourists who inhabit this island during the summer months. Study focus: Using the Support Vector Regression (SVR), the influence of future climate changes on the lake surface water temperature (LSWT) was analysed. Input data were monthly air temperatures (AT). Model training and validation were based on measured LSWT and AT in the period 1981-2022. Expected LSWTs for the period 2023-2070 under the RCP8.5 emission scenario were forecast based on climate modelling data of monthly AT for the period 1971-2070. New hydrological insights for the region: The results showed that the applied SVR model can effectively forecast monthly LSWTs, which was confirmed by a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.99 between the measured and simulated LSWTs. Root mean square errors were lower than 1 degrees C. The LSWT warming trend in 2023-2070 is expected to be lower than that observed in 1981-2022, and will vary from 0.2 degrees C dec-1-0.3 degrees C dec-1. The largest increase in LSWT can be expected in spring while the increase in LSWT will be the smallest in the summer months. In approximately 50 years, the expected LSWT could be higher by an average of 1.2 degrees C.

Air density, atmospheric pressure, temperature, and the instantaneous u and v components of wind speed at three-hourly intervals, with a grid resolution of 32 km were used for estimating wind power. Statistically significant increasing seasonal and annual 33 year trends in wind power predominate over large water bodies like the Great Lakes and eastern James Bay, where ice cover is diminishing. Significant correlations between wind power and decreasing surface albedo corresponding to declining ice-cover, along with increasing instability in the 10-30 m surface layer during the fall and winter months were noted over the Great Lakes, particularly over Lake Superior. The trends suggest a continuing potential for increasing offshore electrical wind generation while lake-ice cover continues to decline. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Water samples were collected in the summer (July) of 2004, during the high-flow season. Inorganic nutrients (N, P, Si) and chlorophyll a (chl a) concentrations of the Wujiangdu Reservoir and its inflow rivers were analyzed. Other water parameters (dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, and electrical conductivity) were measured as well. The results show gradually decreasing concentrations of NO3 (-)-N and dissolved silicate in the surface water moving downstream to the dam of the Wujiangdu Reservoir. Additionally, soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations measured very low, with most falling below the sensitivity threshold of the method used in surface waters. Particulate phosphorus and NO3 (-)-N were the predominant species of phosphorus and nitrogen in the reservoir, respectively. The concentration of nutrients in the Yeji River was the largest of all inflow rivers. The maximum concentration of chl a was found near the dam. These results reflect upstream conditions similar to that of a river, and reservoir conditions near the dam similar to that of a natural lake system.					; Zhong, Jun/O-2421-2013; Li, Siliang/AFB-7205-2022	Li, Si-Liang/0000-0002-0295-9675; 													2096-0956	2365-7499				DEC	2017	36	4			SI		605	610		10.1007/s11631-017-0246-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11631-017-0246-3													WOS:000416237700004

Last millennium climate variability of the varved Lake Jeinimeni geochemical record from NE Chilean Patagonia	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Paleoclimate studies in Patagonia show a high Holocene climate variability, strongly controlled by the intensity and latitudinal position of the Southern Westerly Winds. In this study, environmental and climate variability, and in particular winter precipitation, was reconstructed over the last centuries through sedimentological and geochemical analyses of a core from Lake Jeinimeni in North East Patagonia. Visual description, X-ray radiographies and thin section observations point to finely laminated sediments, made by fine sands and light brown clayey silts forming an annual deposition (varves) occasionally interrupted by two Hudson volcano-related tephras and 15 pluri-millimetre to pluricentimetre coarser sandy to gravely layers. Varve counting confirmed by Pb-210 and Cs-137 indicates a detrital sequence of at least 750 yr. Based on a correlation with local meteorological data for the 1930 -1988AD interval, varve thickness and statistical treatment of XRF geochemical data give information on transport pathway and sedimentary deposit conditions. The sandy laminae correspond to the deposition of high sedimentary load delivered by austral spring snowmelt whereas the clayey silt laminae result of particle settling in the water column during low hydrodynamical conditions. Thicker varves observed in dry conditions underline the importance of aeolian transport in sedimentary deposition. During locally dry and windy summer, the wind may erode and remobilise the sedimentary deposits along the lake margins. The sandy and gravely layers record massive erosional events due to proximal watershed perturbation driven by climatic or tectonic mechanisms. The clastic varves of Lake Jeinimeni document environmental decadal to multidecadal variability in East Patagonia over the last centuries. The more pronounced sediment transition around 1750 CE is consistent with the inception of the Little Ice Agetype event, in agreement with North Patagonian paleoclimate reconstructions derived from glacier advances, lacustrine varve thickness and tree-ring records.

J	Sylvestre, F				Sylvestre, F			A high-resolution diatom reconstruction between 21,000 and 17,4000 14C yr BP from the southern Bolivian Altiplano (18-23°S)	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												A diatom study of lacustrine sediments in the southern part of the Bolivian Altiplano (Salar of Coipasa) provides a continuous record of the period 21,000-17,500 C-14 yr BP. Constrained by seven AMS C-14 dates, this record provides evidence that the Coipasa basin was filled by a shallow body of water during this time. Diatom/salinity and diatom/ionic composition transfer functions indicate that the lake was saline, dominated by sodium-chloride throughout all the period. A comparison with regional data shows that Lake Titicaca could not have overflowed towards the southern Bolivian Altiplano at that time. As this dry phase was not registered in Lake Coipasa, this lake was probably supplied by winter precipitation originating from the Pacific. But, recent data from the deep basin of Lake Titicaca show that the lake-level was higher during this time interval, and the question arises whether precipitation from Atlantic and Amazonia sources could have played an important role on the Altiplano during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). This hypothesis needs to match other available paleoclimatic data from the lowlands of tropical South America, where there is evidence that during the LGM, conditions were drier than today. Global climate simulations suggest a positive P-E on the Altiplano, due to a strong cooling, reducing evaporative demand more than any increase in precipitations. An increase of winter precipitation from the Pacific is in agreement with data from the Chilean coast showing a northward locations of the Westerlies during the LGM. This paleoclimatic hypothesis is also in agreement with a coupled ocean-atmosphere model, which indicates weaker summer precipitation and stronger winter precipitation in the tropical areas.																			0921-2728					JAN	2002	27	1					45	57		10.1023/A:1013542907394	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1013542907394													WOS:000173086500004

Early miocene climate of Central Eurasia - Evidence from Aquitanian floras of Kazakhstan	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The rich fossil record in Kazakhstan documents that during the Oligocene and Early Miocene this area in Central Eurasia was densely forested with warm-temperate deciduous trees and shrubs of the so-called "Turgayan flora". Twenty-nine fossil floras (leaf and pollen assemblages) have been selected for a quantitative analysis of the Aquitanian (early Early Miocene) climate in Kazakhstan. Mean annual temperatures are estimated to have been around 15 degrees C, while values of mean annual precipitation are about 1000 nim. In combination with several other climate parameters estimated (temperatures of the warmest and coldest months, precipitation of the wettest, driest and warmest months), these data reflect uniform climatic conditions over several thousands of square kilometres. Temperature parameter estimates show slight spatial differentiation, with generally cooler mean annual temperatures and higher seasonality (i.e. warmer summers and colder winters) in the north-eastern part of the study area compared with the southwestern area around Lake Aral. As compared with palaeoclimate estimates for the European and East Asian Aquitanian, the central part of the Eurasian continent reveals higher seasonality and slightly increased continentality.

However, the lake water is deteriorating owing to wastewater discharge from nearby hotels, restaurants, and urban settings. Therefore, the current study aims to rate the status of water quality in Phewa Lake concerning the water quality index (WQI), heavy metal pollution index (HPI), and pollution load index (PI). Ten selected physicochemical parameters like pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, nitrate, dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand, turbidity, hardness, chloride, and alkalinity were analysed for the calculation of WQI. Likewise, iron (Fe), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), and nickel (Ni) were selected for HPI and PI calculations. The average WQI value in the winter, rainy, and autumn seasons of 2021 was 33.64, 66.94, and 58.71 respectively. In general, water quality was good in the WQI classification and it showed significant differences seasonally. However, the value of HPI and PI indicated that the water of Phewa Lake is polluted with heavy metals.

J	Hayward, SJ; Gouin, T; Wania, F				Hayward, Stephen J.; Gouin, Todd; Wania, Frank			Levels and Seasonal Variability of Pesticides in the Rural Atmosphere of Southern Ontario	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY												Air samples were collected continuously in Egbert, Ontario, which is in a rural agricultural area north of Toronto, between March 2006 and September 2007 and analyzed for pesticides of both current and historic use. The fungicide chlorothalonil was present in highest abundance with levels exceeding 2000 pg.m(-3) in the summer. Almost as abundant, with summer time concentrations around 400 to 600 pg.m(-3), were the herbicides atrazine, alachlor, and metolachlor. Other pesticides in current use, such as trifluralin, pendimethalin, chlorpyrifos, endosulfan, and disulfoton were consistently present at levels approximately 1 order of magnitude lower. Concentrations of banned pesticides (chlordanes and hexachlorocyclohexane), were generally below 10 pg.m(-3), except for hexachlorobenzene, which was present at the global average of approximately 50 pg.m(-3). These levels and the fact that they are generally lower than what has been reported for the area previously are in agreement with pesticide usage data for Ontario. Only the concentrations of chlorothalonil, chlorpyrifos, and HCB were correlated with air mass origin, as determined by back trajectory analysis. All pesticides had higher levels during the growing season compared to those in winter, but the ratio of concentrations during the different seasons is much higher for the pesticides in current use. That ratio may aid in distinguishing seasonal variability caused by pesticide application during the growing season from that caused by temperature-driven revolatilization. Higher concentrations of the banned pesticides during 2607 compared to those in 2006 may be due to higher volatilization rates caused by higher surface temperatures consistent with the El Nino Southern Oscillation.

The area of the lake fluctuates with the water level, which is closely related to the amount of inflow and evaporation, as the lake complex is endorheic. Using National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellite images of the ice-free periods from 1999 to 2004, we evaluated the seasonal changes in the lake area and surrounding vegetation of the Lake Chany complex. The maximum lake area was observed in early May and decreased until late July. The lake area in August was about 60% of the maximum. Subsequently, the area tended to increase until early October. Compared to ground-truth data, the areas undergoing seasonal fluctuations in the NOAA images corresponded to vast stands of vegetation (Phragmites australis) that were several kilometers wide. These areas seem to be influenced by the inflow of snow-melt water and reed growth. Although interannual differences in the seasonal change in lake area were not great for the whole lake complex, the isolated Yudinskii Pool showed large interannual differences during summer and autumn, suggesting that monitoring this area using NOAA images will be useful for estimating the interannual fluctuations in the southwestern Siberian environment.

Unraveling migratory connectivity of two European diving ducks: a stable isotope approach	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH												Quantifying the strength of migratory connectivity or the degree to which breeding and wintering populations are connected is crucial for conservation and management of migratory birds. Using stable hydrogen isotope ratios of secondary flight feathers (delta H-2(f)), we assessed the breeding origins/locations of 666 common pochards (Aythya ferina) and 190 tufted ducks (A. fuligula) captured in France during the 2005-2006 and 2008-2009 wintering seasons. Isotopic values of common pochards wintering on Grand-lieu Lake (western France) displayed a marked bimodal spatial distribution supportive of strong contributions of both northern (60-65A degrees of latitude) and central European (45-55A degrees of latitude) origins. According to the temporal distribution of delta H-2(f) values, the presence of common pochards of northern origin reached a maximum at the peak of the wintering season (December-January). In contrast, tufted duck did not display a clear bimodal pattern in delta H-2(f), with individuals displaying a more northerly origin (60-70A degrees of latitude), likely of Russian and Scandinavian origin. First-year individuals had more northern origins than adults, suggesting that either isotopic discrimination differed among age groups or, more probably, that some adults may undergo moult at latitudes lower than that of their breeding ground. Tufted ducks with northerly delta H-2(f) values were observed early in the season in individuals sampled in eastern France and late in the season in those sampled in western France. The effects of winter severity on the distribution of individuals over the wintering range were supported for the tufted duck with more northerly values recorded during harsh winters. Management implications of these results are discussed.

Data on distribution, activity patterns, size composition, and relative abundance are presented. The most effective methods for collecting dace were shoreline rotenoning and minnow trapping. The minnow trap catch rates indicate that dace occur primarily in the rocky benthic area of the littoral zone at depths less than 25 ft, but are occasionally found to depths of 200 ft. Dace were most active during the summer and early fall, when water temperatures are warmest, becoming relatively dormant when temperatures dropped below approximately 50 F. The mean size of dace collected was 2.1 in. fork length, with a maximum size of 3.5 in. Length frequency analysis indicated that approximately 6 age groups are represented in the collections.																			0008-1078	2331-0405					1967	53	3					165	+																WOS:A19679712800004

Seasonal changes in Titan's meteorology	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem has observed Titan for similar to 1/4 Titan year, and we report here the first evidence of seasonal shifts in preferred locations of tropospheric methane clouds. South-polar convective cloud activity, common in late southern summer, has become rare. North-polar and northern mid-latitude clouds appeared during the approach to the northern spring equinox in August 2009. Recent observations have shown extensive cloud systems at low latitudes. In contrast, southern mid-latitude and subtropical clouds have appeared sporadically throughout the mission, exhibiting little seasonality to date. These differences in behavior suggest that Titan's clouds, and thus its general circulation, are influenced by both the rapid temperature response of a low-thermal-inertia surface and the much longer radiative timescale of Titan's cold thick troposphere. North-polar clouds are often seen near lakes and seas, suggesting that local increases in methane concentration and/or lifting generated by surface roughness gradients may promote cloud formation.

The reconstruction is based on the application of an established chironomid-based inference model using 100 lakes from the region. The reconstructed summer temperature changes are within 2.4 degrees C of modern throughout the record. The results suggest that the summer temperature changes in south-east margin of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau (QTP) predominantly responds to Asian Summer Monsoon influence, forced by summer insolation until c. 3200 cal. BP. Four cooling events, each separated by c. 500 years (between 3200 and 1600 cal. BP), were observed and these may correspond to the 500-year quasi-periodic solar fluctuation. The most recent cooling period, that is, the Little Ice Age', appears robust in the Heihai Lake record, providing further evidence that a hemisphere-wide forcing mechanism is possible for this climate event.

Use of Phytoplankton Functional Classification and Microbiological Parameters for Environmental Assessment of Coastal Waters of Southern Baikal	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												Absrtact The ecological state of the southern part of Lake Baikal was assessed in 2017 based on the phytoplankton and bacterioplankton structure. Nineteen functional groups were identified, five of which played the main role: Z (picocyanobacteria from oligotrophic lakes), L-O (dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria typical of mesotrophic lakes in summer), X1 (species typical of nutrient-rich shallow lakes), MP (mero- and tycho-planktonic species, mainly diatoms), and E (phytoflagellates typical of oligotrophic lakes). The values of community index Q, obtained on the basis of data on the structure of phytoplankton, indicated the excellent ecological status of the lake. Waters of the southern part of Lake Baikal were characterized as oligotrophic and oligosaprobic, while the waters on sites "Shamansky Cape" and "City of Baikalsk" tended to the mesotrophic and beta-mesosaprobic status according to the data on the chlorophyll a content and microbiological parameters. The absence of significant correlations between phyto- and bacterioplankton parameters may also indicate the oligotrophic status of coastal waters in the southern part of Lake Baikal.

J	Si, D; Jiang, DB; Hu, AX; Lang, XM				Si, Dong; Jiang, Dabang; Hu, Aixue; Lang, Xianmei			Variations in northeast Asian summer precipitation driven by the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												By analysing a 113-year (1900-2012) observational dataset, it is shown that the interdecadal fluctuation of the summer precipitation over Northeast Asia differs from that in central East Asia during the 20th century, and has experienced three interdecadal shifts in the 1920s, mid-1960s and late 1990s. That fluctuation coincides well with the multidecadal fluctuation of the sea surface temperature in the North Atlantic, known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). The AMO affects Northeast Asia via a circumglobal teleconnection pattern extending from the North Atlantic to North America. Corresponding with the positive phase of this teleconnection pattern, a tripolar pattern emerges in the Asian-North Pacific sector, with anomalous low pressure over Northeast Asia and high pressure over Lake Baikal and the mid-latitude western North Pacific. These results suggest that the positive phase of the AMO favours the occurrence of cold vortex over Northeast Asia and anomalous highs over Lake Baikal and the mid-latitude western North Pacific in summer, which enhances the East Asian summer monsoon and southward intrusion of high-latitude cold air, and eventually increases the summer precipitation in Northeast Asia. Furthermore, initialized decadal prediction simulations using the CCSM4 model reproduce well the observed variations of the AMO and its associated atmospheric teleconnection but with slightly shifted geographic locations. The simulated anomalous Northeast Asia cold vortex and strong East Asian summer monsoon, lead to above-normal summer precipitation over Northeast Asia. The modelling results confirm that the multidecadal variability in the North Atlantic can cause the observed interdecadal variations of Northeast Asia summer precipitation. Our results suggest that to understand and predict interdecadal climate change over Northeast Asia, it is important to consider the key role of the AMO.

Seasonal patterns for Secchi depth, chlorophyll a, total phosphorus, and nutrient limitation differ between nearshore and offshore in Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Data on Secchi depth, chlorophyll a, total phosphorus (TP), and nutrient status of phytoplankton were collected at five nearshore sites (11-17 m deep) and two offshore sites (>100 m) between the Grand River and Muskegon River outflows during March-December 2014-2018 to describe seasonal patterns and to compare the two depth regions in southeastern Lake Michigan. In contrast to the offshore, where spring chlorophyll a and TP concentrations declined dramatically following the dreissenid mussel expansion, the nearshore region of southeastern Lake Michigan was still characterized by low Secchi depth and elevated chlorophyll a and TP in the spring. During May, median Secchi depth was 5 times higher in the offshore than the nearshore, whereas chlorophyll a and TP were over 9 and 3 times higher in the nearshore, respectively. Even though spring chlorophyll a and TP have declined substantially at some of the nearshore sites compared to 1996, particularly the sites closest to tributary outflows, the overall yield of chlorophyll a per unit TP did not change over time in the nearshore. There were indications of P-deficiency in the nearshore in 2014-2018, but P-deficiency was even more severe in the offshore during the spring where yield of chlorophyll a per unit TP was also lower than in the nearshore. Although dreissenid mussels can be abundant in the nearshore, their populations are patchy and inputs from tributaries provide conditions that apparently dampen any potential filtering impacts of mussels in the nearshore compared to the offshore, especially during the spring.

We conducted comprehensive geochemical characterization of lake waters, sediment pore waters and lake sediments over two consecutive years to develop a conceptual model of As, iron (Fe), and sulfur (S) dynamics under ice in a shallow subarctic lake (mean depth 2.0 m) impacted by more than 60 yr of As pollution from local gold mining emissions. Lake sediments were a source of As to overlying waters during both winters when oxygen was depleted from interfacial sediments through the reductive dissolution of As-bearing Fe (oxy)hydroxides, but the influence on lake water chemistry was distinctly different between years and dependent on winter hydrology of the lake. When the lake was hydrologically disconnected from the upstream watershed, anoxia developed through the entire water column and high concentrations of As (> 100 mu g L-1) and Fe (> 1000 mu g L-1) were measured in lake water. During the second winter, open-water flow persisted at the lake inlet, which replenished dissolved oxygen in the under-ice water column, suppressed the upward migration of the Fe and SO(4)redox boundaries, and limited sediment As efflux. These findings demonstrate how changing hydrology, specifically ice cover duration, and hydrological connectivity can influence the winter cycling of As, Fe, and S in shallow subarctic lakes.

In late May, daily water levels reached their highest point in over 100 years, and flooding continued throughout much of the summer as lake levels slowly declined, with inundation and erosion significantly impacting shoreline homes and businesses. In this work, we present results from a rapid response online survey of property owners along the New York Lake Ontario shoreline to quantify the perceived flood impacts of the 2017 extended high water event. The survey focused on the degree and spatial distribution of inundation and erosion; the duration and drivers of inundation; the associated damages to different property features, with an emphasis on shoreline protection; and the degree of disruption to business and other activities and services. Photographic documentation of inundation extent and property damage also was provided by survey respondents. We demonstrate the potential utility of this dataset by characterizing key features of inundation and erosion impacts across the shoreline, and by using classification and regression trees to explore the predictability of inundation and erosion based on property characteristics. This work is part of a larger effort to develop models of inundation and erosion that can support flood impact assessments across the shoreline and help communities better prepare for future extended high water events.					; Stedman, Richard/ACN-8032-2022	Steinschneider, Scott/0000-0002-8882-1908; 													1093-474X	1752-1688				AUG	2019	55	4					1065	1079		10.1111/1752-1688.12750	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12750													WOS:000477979100021

Their advantages include a high veracity and reliability, accurate time and location information, a high temporal resolution, seasonal integrity, and rich content. In particular, these data are suitable for reconstructing short-term, high-resolution climate series and extreme climatic events. Through a case study of Yunshan Diary, authored by Bi Guo of the Yuan dynasty of China, this article demonstrates how to delve into climate information in diaries, including species distribution records, phenological records, daily weather descriptions and personal experiences of meteorological conditions. In addition, this article considers how to use these records, supplemented by other data, to reconstruct climate change and extreme climatic events on various timescales, from multidecadal to annual or daily. The study of Yunshan Diary finds that there was a relatively low amount of precipitation in central and southern Jiangsu Province in the summer of 1309; the winter of 1308-1309 was abnormally cold in the Taihu Lake basin. In the early 14th century at the latest, the climate in eastern China had begun to turn cold, which reflects the transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age.

As yet, there have been relatively few studies of aeolian records in Southwestern (SW) China, and thus there is hitherto untapped potential of using such records to reveal regional atmospheric circulation. Rare earth element (REE) and grain-size analyses were carried out on a well-dated sediment core from Lake Lugu, SW China, to establish the provenance of aeolian deposits preserved within the lake during the last 32 kyr. The core sediments (LGH2) possess high dEuN values (0.73-0.87) and exhibit a moderate REE abundance (156-274 ppm). The delta Eu-N-Sigma REE pattern of the Lake Lugu sediments are distinct from those of adjacent geographical areas, but are shown to overlap with the sediments from the Kashmir Valley and northwestern (NW) Deccan Plateau indicating a long-distance dust source. The grain-size endmember for the aeolian deposits shows a gradually increasing trend from 32 kyr B.P. to the onset of the Holocene, followed by a sharp decrease around 9 kyr B.P., with very low values observed during the Holocene optimum (8.3-2 kyr B.P.). Aeolian deposition resumed from 2 kyr B.P. and has continued to the present day. Comparisons with both local and regional palaeoclimate records show that both the local climate and East Asian monsoon (EAM) have not influenced aeolian deposition in Lake Lugu. Rather, changing vegetation cover in the north India and NW Deccan Plateau provided the sediment supply, with entrainment governed by variations in the Southern Winter Westerlies in the dry season (north India), and the South Asian summer monsoon (SASM) in the rainy season (NW Deccan Plateau).

Microplastic pollution usually originates from land-based sources, which are then mainly transported through hydrological and atmospheric pathways and accumulated in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. Urban environments represent a condensed area of human activities (including the production and use of plastic materials), and urban rivers may therefore be a key transporter of microplastic pollution. Understanding microplastic abundances in urban rivers is potentially important in finding effective means of reducing fluvial microplastic discharge. This study quantified microplastic abundances in surface waters along the Fenghua River, Ningbo, a coastal megacity in East China. Microplastic pollution was distributed unevenly along the river, with concentrations ranging from 300 n/m(3) to 4000 n/m(3) (0.3 - 4.0 n/L). Average concenterations were 1620.16 +/- 878.22 n/m(3) (1.62 +/- 0.88 n/L) in summer (43 sampling points) and 1696.08 +/- 983.52 n/m(3) (1.70 +/- 0.98 n/L) in winter (17 sampling points). The most common microplastic shapes, sizes, colors and types of polymers were fiber, <0.5mm, transparent and polypropylene, respectively. Using multidimensional scaling analysis, microplastic distribution patterns were related to seasonal factors and levels of urbanization. No clear relationships were found, with implications for site selection when studying microplastics and the challenges of attributing sources to microplastic pollution in urban rivers.

J	Xue, F; Tan, HB; Zhang, XY; Su, JB				Xue, Fei; Tan, Hongbing; Zhang, Xiying; Su, Jinbao			Sources, enrichment mechanisms, and resource effects of rare metal elements-enriched geothermal springs in Xizang, China	SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES												Rare metals such as lithium (Li), rubidium (Rb), and cesium (Cs) are strategically crucial mineral resources for the development of emerging industries in China. Ensuring a stable long-term supply of these resources is essential. The geothermal systems in Xizang, China are well-developed, with a wide distribution of various types. Most high-temperature geothermal systems in Xizang are exceptionally enriched in rare metal elements (RMEs) and have the potential to become a new source of rare metals to secure China's strategic mineral resource supply in the future. A close relationship also exists between the geothermal system and the special salt lake resources on the Tibetan Plateau. Geothermal springs thus play a key role in the migration and enrichment of RMEs from deep to shallow parts of the crust, in the transition between endogenous and exogenous mineralization, and source-to-sink processes. However, the mechanisms of element enrichment and evolution in these springs have not been systematically discussed, and many theoretical issues remain to be investigated. Based on summarizing and analyzing previous research, this study employs hydrochemical and isotopic geochemistry methods to investigate typical geothermal springs across Xizang and explore the anomalous enrichment mechanism of RMEs, and the resource effects of geothermal springs. Comprehensive analysis shows that the total dissolved solids (TDS) and hydrochemical types of geothermal springs are similar to those of major geothermal fields worldwide, but the Tibetan springs are abnormally rich in Li (averaging 5.48 mg/L), Rb (averaging 0.75 mg/L), and Cs (averaging 3.58 mg/L), which are hundreds to thousands of times more concentrated than natural waters. The distribution of these enriched geothermal springs is controlled by the Yarlung Zangbo suture zone and the extended N-S trending rifts, especially in the intersection zone of the two, where the geothermal springs are the most enriched. Based on the spatial distribution, isotopic, and elemental geochemistry, the RMEs enriched in Tibetan geothermal springs are mainly derived from the magmatic-hydrothermal fluids generated by the partial melting of the subducted Indian plate under the Eurasian continent. These fluids not only maintain geothermal activities as a heat source but also participate in the material cycle of the geothermal spring as a material source. Against the background of regional crustal enrichment in RMEs, incompatible elements such as Li, Rb, and Cs are gradually enriched in magmatic-hydrothermal processes including partial melting in the source, magmatic differentiation, and hydrothermal fluid exsolution, and some ore-forming elements are further extracted from surrounding rocks through deep high-temperature water-rock interactions. Eventually, an eruption occurs, and these fluids move to the surface to form a geothermal spring rich in RMEs. With the drainage of geothermal springs, the RMEs are continuously transported to the lake basin by surface runoff and continue to concentrate and evolve into salt lake brines under an extremely arid climate environment, constituting an endogenous source and exogenous accumulation salt lake metallogenic model. This comprehensive explanation of the sources, migration, enrichment mechanisms, and resource effects of geothermal springs will deepen the understanding of rare metal mineralization processes, and aid in the advancement of theoretical models for key rare metal mineral resources in various geological bodies of the Tibetan Plateau, significantly expanding exploration scopes and accurately assessing the resource potential of RMEs.

J	Moore, JJ; Hughen, KA; Miller, GH; Overpeck, JT				Moore, JJ; Hughen, KA; Miller, GH; Overpeck, JT			Little Ice Age recorded in summer temperature reconstruction from vared sediments of Donard Lake, Baffin Island, Canada	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Clastic varved sediments from Donard Lake, in the Cape Dyer region of Baffin Island, provide a 1250 yr record of decadal-to-centennial scale climate variability. Donard Lake experiences strong seasonal fluctuations in runoff and sediment fluxes due to the summer melting of the Caribou Glacier, which presently dominates its catchment. The seasonal variation in sediment supply results in the annual deposition of laminae couplets. A radiocarbon date measured on moss fragments, with a calibrated age of 860 +/- 80 yrs before present (BP), is in close agreement with the age based on paired-layer counts. Together with the fabric of the laminae determined from microscope analysis, the age agreement demonstrates that the laminae couplets are annually deposited varves. Comparisons of varve thickness and average summer temperature from nearby Cape Dyer show a significant positive correlation (r= 0.57 for annual records, r = 0.82 for 3-yr averages), indicating that varve thickness reflects changes in average summer temperature. Varve thickness was used to reconstruct average summer temperatures for the past 1250 yrs, and shows abrupt shifts and large amplitude decadal-to-centennial scale variability throughout the record. The most prominent feature of the record is a period of elevated summer temperatures from 1200-1375 AD, followed by cooler conditions from 1375-1820 AD, coincident with the Little Ice Age.																			0921-2728					MAY	2001	25	4					503	517		10.1023/A:1011181301514	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1011181301514													WOS:000168538000008
J	Timalsina, NP; Alfredsen, KT; Killingtveit, Å				Timalsina, Netra P.; Alfredsen, Knut T.; Killingtveit, Anund			Impact of climate change on ice regime in a river regulated for hydropower	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING												The ice conditions in a regulated river will depend on the climatic changes as well as the changes to the hydropower operation strategies in the future. The existing literature shows that very few studies have been carried out to investigate the impact of climate change on the river ice regime, which is important for operation of hydropower in cold climates. In this study, a series of modelling tools have been used to transform the climate change signal in terms of precipitation and air temperature into cross-section based river ice assessment in a basin with a complicated hydropower system. The study is based on the EURO-CORDEX climate change data extracted from a regional climate model driven by a suite of five general circulation models with three representative concentration pathways. Hydrological model simulation results show that the winter and spring flow will be increased, which will have an impact on the river ice conditions towards the middle and end of this century. Reservoir-hydropower model simulation shows that the production flows in the winter will be increased in the future. River ice model simulation shows the number of days with freezing water temperature are reduced in the future climate, and correspondingly days with frazil ice are reduced at most of the locations in the study area. The future period with ice cover will also be shortened. The paper also demonstrates a general methodology and procedure to simulate future ice conditions in a regulated river combining multiple models and data sets.																			0315-1468	1208-6029				SEP	2015	42	9			SI		634	644		10.1139/cjce-2014-0261	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjce-2014-0261													WOS:000361977500006
J	Peterson, RE; Tyler, BJ				Peterson, RE; Tyler, BJ			Analysis of organic and inorganic species on the surface of atmospheric aerosol using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS)	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												This work explores the utility of time-of-flight static secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) for the analysis of the surface organic layer on individual atmospheric aerosol particles. The surface sensitivity and minimal fragmentation available with TOF-SIMS suggest that it can be a powerful tool for the examination of the organic and inorganic species on the surface of individual particles. Cascade impactors were used to collect aerosol from summer 2000 Montana forest fires, winter snowmobile samples in Yellowstone National Park, Hawaiian lava and sea salt, from an Asian Dust event reaching Salt Lake City, Utah in April 2001 and from Salt Lake Valley summer urban aerosol. TOF-SIMS analysis and multivariate statistical techniques combined gave chemical and morphological information about the particles. Surfaces of the aerosol from forest fires, snowmobile exhaust, and sea salt were all dominated by aliphatic hydrocarbons and their amphiphilic derivatives. Each source showed a different organic chemical signature. The extent and composition of the organics layer which typically covers the surface of atmospheric particles are expected to effect all of the surface related aerosol properties such as health effects, the ability of the particle to activate and form cloud droplets, and the aggregation of particles as well as reactions between the particle and gas phase species.

The lentic systems were categorized into three ALT groups: group I (< 800 m a.s.l.), group II (800-1600 m a.s.l.), and group III (> 1600 m a.s.l.). Changes in species composition and dominant species were observed with increasing ALT, with certain species showing a preference for higher ALT and exhibiting higher ALT optima values. The species composition of group III was markedly different from the other groups. Phytoplankton biovolume, species richness (alpha diversity), and the Shannon diversity index did not show a correlation with ALT. However, group III lentic systems exhibited the lowest biovolume values, while group I systems had the lowest species richness. The total species richness (gamma diversity) of Cryptista (Cryptophytes) and the dominance of flagellate species increased with ALT. While phytoplankton trophic index (PTI) indicated all the systems had only moderate and poor ecological qualities, trophic state index (TSI) did not detect any high-quality lentic systems in group III. In contrast, the PHYTO-TR index demonstrated that group III exhibited a higher proportion of lentic systems classified as good and high quality, providing a more accurate evaluation of the ecological quality of lentic systems. ALT indirectly influenced habitat diversity and the degree of human impact, thereby affecting some parameters, such as temperature, electrical conductivity, alkalinity, pH, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus. Consequently, these parameters were significant determinants of phytoplankton distribution, composition, biovolume, species richness (alpha and gamma diversity), and the ecological quality of these lentic systems.

Convection can occur in the early winter, but the most vigorous convection occurred near the end of winter. Both periods are when our lake ice model suggest thinner ice that would have been transparent. This under-ice convection led to a deepening of the mixed layer over time, consistent with previous short-term studies. During periods of vigorous convection under the ice at the end of winter, the dissolved oxygen had become supersaturated from the surface to 23m below the surface, suggesting abundant algal growth. Analysis of our high-frequency observations over the entire winter of 2015 using the Thorpe-scale method quantified the scale of mixing. Furthermore, it revealed that changes in oxygen concentrations are closely related to the intensity of mixing.					; wells, mathew/A-7101-2012; Brown, Laura/F-5932-2011	Brown, Laura/0000-0002-3173-8433; wells, mathew/0000-0003-3838-9202; Yang, Bernard/0000-0003-3646-0634													0094-8276	1944-8007				DEC 28	2017	44	24					12218	12226		10.1002/2017GL075373	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017GL075373													WOS:000422954700024
J	Sun, HM; Wu, RF; Wang, ZB				Sun, Huamin; Wu, Renguang; Wang, Zhibiao			Dependence of spring Eurasian surface air temperature anomalies on the amplitude and polarity of the North Atlantic tripole SST anomalies	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												This study compares boreal spring surface air temperature (SAT) anomalies over mid- and high-latitude Eurasia in different categories of the North Atlantic tripole sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies for the period 1951-2018. It is found that Eurasian SAT anomalies depend largely upon the amplitude and polarity of the North Atlantic tripole SST anomalies (positive polarity for positive SST anomalies in the tropics and mid-latitude and negative SST anomalies in the subtropics). The main processes contributing to SAT anomalies vary with the region. In large amplitude positive tripole years, the SAT decreases in Europe and east of the Lake Baikal due to longwave radiation and sensible heat flux and increases in Siberia due to horizontal advection associated with anomalous northerlies. In large amplitude negative tripole years, the SAT increases in Europe and eastern Eurasia due to horizontal advection associated with anomalous southerlies. In small amplitude positive tripole years, the SAT increases in central Eurasia due to horizontal advection associated with mean and anomalous meridional winds. In small amplitude negative tripole years, the SAT decreases in southern central Eurasia, which is contributed by both longwave radiation and horizontal advection associated with anomalous northeasterlies. Atmospheric circulation influences SAT both directly through horizontal advection associated with anomalous winds and indirectly through shortwave radiation and in turn upward longwave radiation and sensible heat flux. The results reveal the necessity of distinguishing the amplitude and polarity of the North Atlantic SST anomalies in their impacts on climate variability.																			0177-798X	1434-4483				OCT	2022	150	1-2					103	119		10.1007/s00704-022-04149-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-022-04149-7		JUL 2022											WOS:000829147800001

Phytoplankton abundances were low in both the mixolimnion (up to 15 m depth) and monimolimnion (below 15 m depth). In summer and winter, carbon dioxide release was 3-fold and 5-fold higher, respectively, in the monimolimnion than in the mixolimnion. Laboratory enrichments of the sulphur substrate of the water resulted in a decrease in oxygen consumption rate of by about 42% in mixolimnion samples, and in the carbon dioxide release rate by about 69% in monimolimnion samples. Water temperature, pH and bivalent ion contents were of major importance in shaping the microbial metabolic efficiency in the mixolimnion, whilst in the monimolimnion these relationships were not evident.					; Wilk-Wozniak, Elzbieta/A-4218-2008	Wilk-Wozniak, Elzbieta/0000-0002-4929-6733; 													1730-413X						2008	37	2					3	19		10.2478/v10009-007-0047-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10009-007-0047-9													WOS:000261671600001
J	IRVINE, JR; NORTHCOTE, TG				IRVINE, JR; NORTHCOTE, TG			SIGNIFICANCE OF SEQUENTIAL FEEDING PATTERNS OF JUVENILE RAINBOW-TROUT IN A LARGE LAKE-FED RIVER	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Rainbow trout fry S. gairdneri, feeding during the day in a large river below a lake, far more frequently attached drifting organisms than substrate-associated organisms. Recently emerged fry struck at prey more frequently than did older fry. Zooplankton from the lake upstream were the prey most frequently consumed by small fry; larger aquatic and terrestrial insects were the major food of larger fry. Of those zooplankters fed upon by small fry, large calanoid copepods (mainly Epischura nevadensis) and Daphnia galeata mendotae were selectively consumed and smaller Bosmina longirostris rarely consumed, as would be expected of size-selective predators, but large Cyclops bicuspidatus were also under-represented in fry stomachs. There was a seasonal increase in size of prey consumed. The relative prey size (size of prey consumed divided by fry size) increased throughout the year, except from fall to winter when fry growth was slow. The sequential change in feeding patterns increased the efficiency of energy intake for the young rainbow trout, conserved their energy expenditure and thereby improved their likelihood for survival.

J	de Pablo, MA				de Pablo, Miguel angel			Timelapse images datasets (2017-2022) from Livingston and Deception Islands, Antarctica, to study snow cover and weather conditions at the PERMATHERMAL monitoring network	DATA IN BRIEF												In the Deception and Livingston Islands, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, two sites belonging to the international Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) network were established in 2005 and 2009, respectively, as part of the PERMATHERMAL network. In 2017, part of the installed instrumentation was upgraded, incorporating new CC5MPX automatic photographic cameras from Campbell Scientific to acquire three daily photographs at 5Mpx in resolution, 2592 x 1984 pixels in size, and JPEG format. The photographs are taken during the central hours of the day (14, 15, and 16 h GMT) to ensure maximum brightness, even during the Antarctic winter. Powered by batteries and solar panels, two cameras were installed at each site with a panoramic view, devoid of vegetation except for small patches of moss. At each study point, the cameras are oriented in different directions, providing diverse angles of the study area, and allowing observation of various fields of view in the environment. The result is a dataset of images acquired in the 2017-2022 period, organized by site, year, and month, capturing environmental conditions and spatial distribution of the snow cover. This dataset, besides documenting the snow cover, allows assessment of meteorological conditions, prevailing wind directions in the area during snow events, even in more distant areas from the study point due to the configured field of view. In the case of the images from Livingston Island, it also enables the study of the Limnopolar Lake's fluctuating water level during spring and summer. For the images from Deception Island, it provides insight into the presence of pack ice in Foster Port, relevant for volcanic activity and the safety of numerous vessels entering the caldera of the active volcano.

J	Aberg, J; Bergström, AK; Algesten, G; Söderback, K; Jansson, M				Aberg, J; Bergström, AK; Algesten, G; Söderback, K; Jansson, M			A comparison of the carbon balances of a natural lake (L.!Ortrasket) and a hydroelectric reservoir (L.!Skinnmuddselet) in northern Sweden	WATER RESEARCH												Carbon balances were calculated for the summer stratification period of 2001 for the hydroelectric reservoir L. Skinnmuddselet (created in 1989) and the natural L. Ortrasket, and estimated on annual basis for both lakes. The reservoir and the lake have similar chemical characteristics and are located in adjacent catchments in the northern part of Sweden. Our main hypothesis was that the CO2 Production and emissions from the reservoir, L. Skinnmuddselet, would be greater than in the natural L. Ortrasket, due to the decomposition of flooded vegetation and peat. The carbon balances showed that the total production Of CO2 per unit lake surface area during the summer was very similar in the natural lake and the reservoir (31.3 g C m(-2) in L. Ortrasket and 25.3 g C m(-2) in L. Skinnmuddselet). The sediments were the major CO2 source in the reservoir, while most of the mineralization in the natural lake occurred in the water column. On annual basis the natural L. Ortrasket produced and emitted more CO2 per unit of lake surface area than the reservoir L. Skinnmuddselet since mineralization proceeded during winter when L. Skinnmuddselet was emptied for electricity production. Therefore, the potential for CO2 emission was not greater in the reservoir than in the natural lake. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Langman, JB; Torso, K; Moberly, JG				Langman, Jeff B.; Torso, Kathleen; Moberly, James G.			Seasonal and Basinal Influences on the Formation and Transport of Dissolved Trace Metal Forms in a Mining-Impacted Riverine Environment	HYDROLOGY												The release of nanophase metal particles from sulfide mineral decomposition in mining-impacted environments is a growing concern because of the potential for the transport of nanoscale particles that could increase the distribution of the metals and their environmental impact. An analysis of total (unfiltered) and dissolved (450-nm filtered) metal concentrations in the mining-impacted Coeur d'Alene River indicates the leaching of dissolved metal forms from sediments and transport to and within the river. The distribution of metals between total and dissolved forms is driven by seasonal temperatures, hydraulic gradients, and ligand availability. Cd and Zn were the least influenced by changes in gradient and biological productivity between the upper and lower basins. Cd and Zn primarily travel as dissolved forms, with the lowest ratio of dissolved-to-total concentrations in spring and the highest in summer. Fe and Pb primarily travel as suspended particles, but their dissolved forms were greater during all seasons in the lower basin. A principal components analysis of upper basin data indicates that temperature and conductivity were correlated with dissolved Cd and Zn, and total Fe and Pb were correlated with streamflow. In the lower basin, dissolved Cd and Zn, conductivity, and temperature were correlated, and suspended sediment, total metals, and dissolved Pb, but not streamflow, were correlated. The correlation of metals and sediment in the lower basin is not from erosion but the availability of organic matter and Fe that form a range of dissolved to suspended metal particles. The summer decrease in surface water levels releases sediment porewater containing nanoscale-to-microscale metal particles that are transported to open water, where they may impact human and wildlife health. Such releases are unmitigated with current remediation strategies of sediment stabilization.

A.; Belykh, O., I			Recent changes in the spring microplankton of Lake Baikal, Russia	LIMNOLOGICA												Lake Baikal is facing several environmental stressors, including climate change and nearshore eutrophication. To assess recent ecological changes in Lake Baikal and provide a baseline for future comparisons, we sampled spring plankton communities from the pelagic zone of the lake in 2016 and compared these data with unpublished and published historical information going back to 1990. In 2016, one pelagic long-term monitoring station was sampled in early spring (March) during ice cover and 21 long-term monitoring stations located throughout the lake were sampled in late spring (May-June). We measured water chemistry parameters at most stations and the abundance, taxonomic composition and biomass of bacteria, ciliates and phytoplankton at several locations in different areas of the lake. Biotic parameters from 2016 were compared with historical data, showing significant changes in the spring pelagic microbial community since the 1990s. We show increased quantities of small species, mixotrophic ciliates, and the appearance (or increasing number) of small coloured and colourless flagellates. We also show substantially decreased densities of formerly dominant heavily silicified diatoms such as Aulacoseira spp. Since 2007, Synedra acus subsp. radians, a smaller and weakly silicified diatom, has dominated the spring plankton of the lake. These results suggest that Lake Baikal's pelagic plankton community may be changing, with climate likely playing a dominant role in these changes.

J	BANACH, A				BANACH, A			POPULATION OF THE BANK VOLE IN THE MOSAIC OF FOREST BIOTOPES	ACTA THERIOLOGICA												The influence of a mosaic of forest habitats on ecological differentiating of a population of Clethrionomys glareolus (Schreber, 1780) was investigated. The study was carried out between 1977 and 1979 close to the town of Mikolajki (Mazurian Lake Region, Poland), in adjoining alderwood, pine wood, willow brushwood and ash thicket areas using the CMR method. On the basis of the distribution of subsequent catching places one-habitat and multihabitat individuals were distinguished. An analysis of various population parameters indicated that one-habitat individuals from the alderwood, pine wood and willow brushwood differed from one another and formed groups in which certain demographic and density dependent processes had an internal (local) character. Multihabitat individuals occupied areas adjoining the border and displayed the characteristics of population dominants. The density of the multihabitat bank voles per unit of area was constant from summer to autumn and independent of one-habitat bank voles density. An increase in the density of the latter ones brought about a decrease in the areas of home ranges of multihabitat bank voles.																			0001-7051	2190-3743				AUG	1988	33	1-11					87	102		10.4098/AT.arch.88-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.4098/AT.arch.88-8													WOS:A1988R179500008

Hence the lakes respond instantly to the seasonal climate of the region. The Antarctic seasons respond sharply to the glacial and interglacial climates and these signatures are archived in the lake sediments. A sediment core from Sandy Lake, a periglacial lake located in Schirmacher Oasis of East Antarctica records distinct changes in grain-size, C, N, C/N ratios (atomic), delta(13) COM and delta(15) NOM contents during the last 36 ky. The contents of the sedimentary organic matter (OM) proxies (Corg similar to 0.3 +/- 0.2%, C/N ratios similar to 9 +/- 5 and delta(13) COM similar to-18 +/- 6%) indicate that the OM in this lake sediment is a product of mixing of terrestrial and lacustrine biomass. Distinctly lower contents of Corg (similar to 0.2%) and sand (similar to 50%), low C/N ratios (similar to 8) and depleted delta(13) COM (similar to-20%) during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM: 32-17 ky BP based on Vostok Temperatures) suggest greater internal (autochthonous) provenance of organic matter and limited terrestrial (allochthonous) inputs probably due to long and intense winters in the Antarctic. Such intense winters might have resulted the lake surface to be ice-covered for most part of the year when the temperatures remained consistently colder than the Holocene temperatures. The denitrification within the lake evident by enriched delta(15) NOM ([10%) during Antarctic LGM might have resulted from oxygenlimitation within the lake environment caused by insulated lake surface. The gradual increases in delta(13) COM, C/N and sand content starting at similar to 11 ky BP and attaining high values (*-11%,similar to 10 and similar to 80% respectively) at similar to 6 ky BP together suggest a subtle change in the balance of sources of organic matter between algal and macrophyte/bryophyte nearly 8-9 ky later to the beginning of the deglaciation. Thus the seasonal opening-up of the Sandy Lake similar to the modern pattern started with the establishment of the optimum temperature conditions (i.e., 0 degrees C anomaly) in the Antarctic, prior to which the lake environment might have remained mostly insulated or closed.					; Warrier, Anish/AAW-8890-2020; Roy, Rajdeep/G-7790-2011	roy, rajdeep/0000-0001-5509-257X; Badnal, Mahesh/0000-0001-6593-4611; Tiwari, Manish/0000-0003-3143-1658; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				OCT	2017	58	3					275	289		10.1007/s10933-017-9977-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-017-9977-8													WOS:000410483900001

Samples were taken during the autumn circulation 2007 and spring circulation 2008 over the deepest site of each of the bay and compared to previous data. The lake consists of two parts: eumictic tomaszkowska (459 ha, 22 m), and bradymictic barwinska (246 ha, 54.6 m), separated by an inlet with a length of about 60 m and depth 3.8 m. Subcatchments both of bays vary in size and the way of use. Tomaszkowska is more vulnerable to tourist pressure and 62.7% used of agriculture, while the fields and meadows in subcatchment of Barwinska constitute 46.3%. This was reflected in the findings obtained: tomaszkowska has lower visibility of Secchi disc (1.5-1.75 m), higher chlorophyll a concentration (23.25-26.19 mg . m(-3)) and pheophytin (60.11-64.77 mg . m(-3)), a larger amount of allochthonous matter and a clear upward trend of this parameter in the deepest part of water.

Indicators of exposure to estrogenic compounds at Great Lakes Areas of Concern: species and site comparisons	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Adverse effects resulting from potential exposure of wild fishes to estrogenic endocrine disruptors were assessed at seven United States Great Lakes Areas of Concern using biomarkers ranging from organismal (gonadosomatic indices) to tissue/plasma (histology, plasma vitellogenin) and molecular (hepatic gene transcripts) levels. Biomonitoring was conducted on pelagic, top predator species, largemouth Micropterus salmoides and smallmouth M. dolomieu bass and benthic, omnivorous white sucker Catostomus commersonii. Seasonal (spring and fall) comparisons were conducted at select sites. Intersex (testicular oocytes), plasma vitellogenin, and hepatic vitellogenin transcripts were commonly observed in bass species. Testicular oocyte severity was positively, although weakly, correlated with plasma vitellogenin, hepatic transcripts of vitellogenin, estrogen receptor alpha, and estrogen receptor beta 2, while negatively correlated with androgen receptor beta and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. No testicular oocytes were observed in white sucker; however, plasma vitellogenin and hepatic vitellogenin transcripts were commonly detected in the males. The results demonstrate the importance of utilizing multiple endpoints to assess exposure to estrogenic compounds as well as the importance of choosing sensitive species.					; Iwanowicz, Luke/AAB-3247-2021	Blazer, Vicki/0000-0001-6647-9614; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				OCT	2018	190	10							577	10.1007/s10661-018-6943-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-018-6943-5								30191322					WOS:000444178200002

Enhancing Soil and Water Assessment Tool Snow Prediction Reliability with Remote-Sensing-Based Snow Water Equivalent Reconstruction Product for Upland Watersheds in a Multi-Objective Calibration Process	WATER												Precipitation occurs in two basic forms defined as liquid state and solid state. Different from rain-fed watershed, modeling snow processes is of vital importance in snow-dominated watersheds. The seasonal snowpack is a natural water reservoir, which stores snow water in winter and releases it in spring and summer. The warmer climate in recent decades has led to earlier snowmelt, a decline in snowpack, and change in the seasonality of river flows. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) could be applied in the snow-influenced watershed because of its ability to simultaneously predict the streamflow generated from rainfall and from the melting of snow. The choice of parameters, reference data, and calibration strategy could significantly affect the SWAT model calibration outcome and further affect the prediction accuracy. In this study, SWAT models are implemented in four upland watersheds in the Tulare Lake Basin (TLB) located across the Southern Sierra Nevada Mountains. Three calibration scenarios considering different calibration parameters and reference datasets are applied to investigate the impact of the Parallel Energy Balance Model (ParBal) snow reconstruction data and snow parameters on the streamflow and snow water-equivalent (SWE) prediction accuracy. In addition, the watershed parameters and lapse rate parameters-led equifinality is also evaluated. The results indicate that calibration of the SWAT model with respect to both streamflow and SWE reference data could improve the model SWE prediction reliability in general. Comparatively, the streamflow predictions are not significantly affected by differently lumped calibration schemes. The default snow parameter values capture the extreme high flows better than the other two calibration scenarios, whereas there is no remarkable difference among the three calibration schemes for capturing the extreme low flows. The watershed and lapse rate parameters-induced equifinality affects the flow prediction more (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) varies between 0.2-0.3) than the SWE prediction (NSE varies less than 0.1). This study points out the remote-sensing-based SWE reconstruction product as a promising alternative choice for model calibration in ungauged snow-influenced watersheds. The streamflow-reconstructed SWE bi-objective calibrated model could improve the prediction reliability of surface water supply change for the downstream agricultural region under the changing climate.

In this lake, near bottom springs, a very fine material ''suspended sediment'' remains in suspension. Dissolved Fe2+ in interstitial water of this suspended sediment, is related to redox potential and to the bottom water inflow. In the water column, soluble iron is present in the hypolimnion of the six different basins forming Lake Banyoles. Under those conditions Fe2+ is partially removed by sulfide produced in the anoxic sediment. In addition, a peak of Fe2+ found at the density gradient level in basins C-III, C-IV and C-VI. A three compartment model on the dynamics of the processes involving iron in Lake Banyoles is proposed. The bottom springs supply oxygen to the anoxic hypolimnion affecting chemical processes of the iron cycle. The presence of phototrophic sulfur bacteria in the anoxic monimolimnion of basins C-III and C-IV can be related to the kinetics of Fe2+ and sulfide. In C-III sulfide concentration exceeds Fe2+ concentraction whereas in C-IV sulfide is not detectable and iron reached values up to 60 mM. The presence of phototrophic sulfur bacteria in iron-containing environments with no detectable sulfide is explained by the ability of such microorganisms to use FeS as electron donor instead of H2S.

Influences on the carbonate hydrochemistry of mound spring environments, Lake Eyre South region, South Australia	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Mound spring structures composed of tufa precipitated from near-ambient temperature spring waters are rare; consequently, the hydrochemical evolution of the water and the processes that control carbonate deposition in these systems are not well understood. This study analysed the water from 3 mound springs in an arid environment in the vicinity of Lake Eyre South, South Australia. Samples were tested for major ion chemistry and stable isotope ratios of water (H-2/H-1 and O-18/O-16). Most CO2 degasses from water (i) before emergence as it ascends in the fracture-derived spring conduit system below the spring opening and (ii) after emergence in the turbulent upper tail environment between the spring vent pool and the tail delta. However, modern carbonate precipitation was generally restricted to tail delta environments, spatially disconnected from the areas of strongest CO2-degassing. In addition to CO2-degassing and carbonate precipitation, evapotranspiration and heterotrophy were inferred to be processes controlling the chemical evolution of water flowing through the tail delta. Based on considerations of the geometry of the tail delta and evapotranspiration rates, it was inferred that infiltration is an important process in determining the tail delta size and hence the morphology of the mound spring environment. A reactive transport model was used to assess the importance of these processes for the evolution of carbonate hydrochemistry. The model outcomes showed that water loss via evapotranspiration does not significantly affect tufa precipitation, despite the springs being located within an arid environment. Heterotrophy was considered in the model in order to reproduce observed pH and carbonate concentrations, highlighting the role of vegetation in controlling the water chemistry. The modelling approach adopted here provides a generic framework for the analysis of calcareous spring deposits and places quantitative constraints on data-based process conceptualisation.

Dark-flight Estimates of Meteorite Fall Positions: Issues and a Case Study Using the Murrili Meteorite Fall	PLANETARY SCIENCE JOURNAL												Fireball networks are used to recover meteorites, with the context of orbits. Observations from these networks cover the bright flight, where the meteoroid is luminescent, but to recover a fallen meteorite, these observations must often be predicted forward in time to the ground to estimate an impact position. This dark-flight modeling is deceptively simple, but there is hidden complexity covering the precise interactions between the meteorite and the (usually active) atmosphere. We describe the method and approach used by the Desert Fireball Network, detailing the issues we have addressed, and the impact that factors such as shape, mass, and density have on the predicted fall position. We illustrate this with a case study of Murrili meteorite fall that occurred into Lake Eyre-Kati Thanda in 2015. The fall was very well observed from multiple viewpoints, and the trajectory was steep, with a low-altitude endpoint, such that the dark flight was relatively short. Murrili is 1.68 kg with a typical ordinary chondrite density but with a somewhat flattened shape compared to a sphere, such that there are discrepancies between sphere-based predictions and the actual recovery location. It is notable that even in this relatively idealized dark-flight scenario, modeling using spherically shaped projectiles resulted in a significant distance between predicted fall position and recovered meteorite.

NO2 concentrations were highest in the early morning and late evening. Mean concentrations were highest in winter, although individual one-hour NO2 concentrations were found to be highest in summer. Wind direction was the strongest control on hourly NO2 concentration, and temperature and wind speed also had an effect. Our analysis of NO2 concentration variation by wind direction showed that areas downwind of major highways, urban centres and industry were exposed to higher pollutant concentrations. Seasonal patterns of NO2 concentration displayed significant spatial heterogeneity, in particular, in Toronto. Onshore winds sheltered coastal inhabitants from the full extent of NO2 exposure they would otherwise experience. Seasonal variations in meteorology and emissions mean that the degree of spatial variability in NO2 concentrations changes from season to season. This study will help to improve existing land-use regression-based NO2 prediction models by incorporating meteorological controls on NO2 distributions for health effect studies.

Among them, El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is important to drought occurrence. However, it is still not fully understood how the probability of regional droughts corresponding to different ENSO regimes varies with time lags. In this study, the event-based coincidence analysis (ECA) is employed to statistically derive the relationships regarding time information and magnitude between conventional ENSO (c-ENSO)/ENSO Modoki (ENSO_M) episodes and drought events. The standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) based on station-records is used to determine meteorological droughts. Our study focuses on the largest freshwater lake of China, Poyang Lake basin (PLB), as severe droughts have occurred there frequently. Results indicate that the summer-autumn continuous drought dominates the severe droughts, with a frequent onset in August/September, and a cessation in October/ November. The likelihood of drought occurrence is highest during cool phases of c-ENSO (CEN), followed by warm ENSO_M (WEM), warm c-ENSO (WEN), and cool ENSO_M (CEM). The influence of WEN/WEM on droughts is statistically significant mostly for a time lag of 10 months, whereas CEN/CEM shows no lagged influence. Furthermore, the variability of the 850 hPa wind anomalies during different ENSO episodes at various time lags is corresponding to the lagged influence of ENSO on droughts. The development and persistence of droughts is resulting from strengthened northeasterly wind anomalies over the PLB. Our findings demonstrate that the ENSO anomalies are early warning signals of droughts and hence can be beneficial for increasing the drought predictivity					Kunstmann, Harald/A-7071-2013; Wei, Jianhui/K-3567-2016; wang, jiayi/KSL-7634-2024; Laux, Patrick/A-7671-2013	Kunstmann, Harald/0000-0001-9573-1743; Wei, Jianhui/0000-0001-8609-9600; 													0169-8095	1873-2895				SEP	2022	275								106218	10.1016/j.atmosres.2022.106218	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2022.106218		MAY 2022											WOS:000797657200002

The first eagles were found dead during November, soon after arrival from fall migration, and deaths continued into January during both episodes. In total, 29 eagles died at or near DeGray Lake in the winter of 1994-1995 and 26 died in the winter of 1996-1997; no eagle mortality was noted during the same months of the intervening winter or in the earlier history of the lake. During the mortality events, sick eagles were observed overflying perches or colliding with rock walls. Signs of incoordination and limb paresis were also observed in American coots (Fulica americana) during the episodes of eagle mortality, but mortality in coots was minimal. No consistent abnormalities were seen on gross necropsy of either species. No microscopic findings in organs other than the central nervous system (CNS) could explain the cause of death. By light microscopy, all 26 eagles examined and 62/77 (81%) coots had striking, diffuse, spongy degeneration of the white matter of the CNS. Vacuolation occurred in all myelinated CNS tissue, including the cerebellar folia and medulla oblongata, but was most prominent in the optic tectum. In the spinal cord, vacuoles were concentrated near the gray matter, and occasional swollen axons were seen. Vacuoles were uniformly present in optic nerves but were not evident in the retina or peripheral or autonomic nerves. Cellular inflammatory response to the lesion was distinctly lacking. Vacuoles were 8-50 mu m in diameter and occurred individually, in clusters, or in rows. In sections stained by luxol fast blue/periodic acid-Schiff stain, the vacuoles were delimited and transected by myelin strands. Transmission electron microscopy revealed intramyelinic vacuoles formed in the myelin sheaths by splitting of one or more myelin lamellae at the intraperiodic line. This lesion is characteristic of toxicity from hexachlorophene, triethyltin, bromethalin, isonicotinic acid hydrazide, and certain exotic plant toxins; however, despite exhaustive testing, no etiology was determined for the DeGray Lake mortality events. This is the first report of vacuolar myelinopathy associated with spontaneous mortality in wild birds.																			0300-9858	1544-2217				NOV	1998	35	6					479	487		10.1177/030098589803500602	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/030098589803500602								9823589					WOS:000078622500002

Knowledge of the suspended particle size and its changes in month and area can be used to assess the contributions by suspended particulate matter to backscatter coefficient, particle sinking, and carbon sequestration under lake water. In this study, in situ samples collected in the summer and winter from Hongze Lake (HZL), 2016, were used to develop an empirical model to estimate the median diameter (D-V(50)) of suspended particle sizes. The spatial distributions of D-V(50) were derived using 37 WFV (Wide Field Viewer) images of GF-1 (GaoFen-1), China, and the fluctuational diversification and the potential influencing factors were discussed. Several crucial findings can be drawn: (1) the empirical band ratio algorithm R-rs,R-green: R-rs,R-red was suitable for D-V(50) estimation with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of approximately 0.7 for the modelling data. In addition, the validation data showed that the MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) is below 34%, the RMSE (root mean square error) is less than 4.2 mu m, and the Mean ratio is close to 1; (2) the average median particle size shows an increasing trend from the northeast of the lake (NE) to Chengzi Lake (CZL) and the wetland (WL) in HZL from 2015 to 2016; (3) the D-V(50) of HZL is higher in summer than in the other seasons during the study period; (4) the fluctuation in hydrological factors, especially the monthly water discharge and flow, might be the driving force behind the seasonal variations in D-V(50) of HZL; and (5) channel transportation reduced D-V(50), and the reduced amplitude might be more than 22%.

Densities and distribution of flagellates and ciliates in the chemocline of saline, meromictic Lake Shunet (Siberia, Russia)	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												The vertical and seasonal distributions of the phytoflagellate Cryptomonas spp., and its most common, the planktonic ciliate predators (Oligotrichida, Scuticociliatida, Hypotrichida and Prostomatida) were investigated in chemocline region of small saline, meromictic lake Shunet (Siberia, Russia) during 2003 and 2005. The lake has a pronounced chemocline, with abundance of purple and green sulphur bacteria. Vertical distribution of the Cryptomonas populations near the oxic/anoxic boundary layer was studied at close intervals in water sampled using a hydraulically operated thin-layer sampler. In both summer and winter, Cryptomonas peaked in water stratum 5-10 cm above anoxic zone or in the anoxic zone water column in the chemocline (about 5 m). Ciliate densities and biomass were also much higher in chemocline than in mixolimnion. The range of diurnal migration of Cryptomonas population was not very wide, and it was restricted to layers with high light intensity. The ciliates were sometimes detected above the upper border of the anoxic zone but also several centimetres below this zone.

Reconstructing temperature during the Last Glacial Maximum from Lyndon Stream, South Island, New Zealand using beetle fossils and maximum likelihood envelopes	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												This paper presents fossil beetle data from a Last Glacial Maximum site at the Lyndon Stream, in the Canterbury foothills, South Island, New Zealand. Paleotemperatures are derived using the maximum likelihood envelope (MLE) model developed for regions where modern distribution data are incomplete [Marra et al., 2004. Late quaternary climate change in the Awatere Valley, South Island, New Zealand using a sine model with a maximum likelihood envelope on fossil beetle data. Quaternary Science Reviews 23, 1637-1650]. The MLE model results indicate that summer temperatures in the Canterbury foothills, in close proximity to the major Rakaia glacier, at ca 22,000 C-14 yr BP were between 0.5 degrees C warmer and 1.9 degrees C cooler than present day in February (summer). Mean minimum winter temperatures ranged between 1 degrees C warmer and 2.2 degrees C cooler than the present day. These apparently surprising results confirm and quantify existing climate reconstructions from plant macrofossils from this site [Soons, J.M., Burrows, C.J., 1978. Dates for Otiran deposits, including plant microfossils and macrofossils, from Rakaia Valley. New Zealand Journal of Geology and Geophysics 21, 607-615].

We combined ecological surveys, life table studies, microscopy and molecular sequencing to determine the development, ecology, pathology and phylogeny of Polycaryum laeve, an endoparasite of cladocerans. We report the first records of P. laeve from North America, where we have used a polymerase chain reaction primer and microscopic examination to confirm infections in 14 lakes. Infections are highly pathogenic and caused increased mortality, reduced growth, and reproductive castration in Daphnia pulicaria during life table studies. 2. Biweekly data from Allequash Lake (Wisconsin, U.S.A.) throughout 2003 indicated that fecundity and infection prevalence were inversely correlated. Infection prevalence was highest in late winter and early spring (up to 80%) and lowest during late summer. Epidemics were generally followed by sharp declines in host population density (up to 99%). 3. Within the haemocoel of its host, P. laeve forms thick-walled sporangia, which occur systemically in later stages of infection. Fungal thalli associate closely with muscle fibres and connective tissue, leading to degeneration as the infection becomes advanced. Following death of the host, flagellated zoospores are released through an exit papilla on the sporangium. Based on the infection-induced castration of the host and increases in infection prevalence with Daphnia size, we postulate that transmission is horizontal, but may be indirect through an additional host or free-living stage. 4. Molecular and morphological data clearly indicate that P. laeve belongs in the fungal phylum Chytriodiomycota, order Blastocladiales. Based on ribosomal RNA gene sequences and morphological features, we transfer the genus Polycaryum from the Haplosporidia to the Chytridiomycota, and designate a lectotype and epitype for P. laeve. Considering the high prevalence of P. laeve infection within Daphnia populations, the frequency with which we detected infections among lakes, and the keystone importance of large-bodied Daphnia in aquatic food webs, we suggest that P. laeve may exert a regulatory influence on Daphnia populations in lake ecosystems.

In Lake Washington net zooplankton respiration rates estimated from ETS [electron transport system] activity ranged from 22.4-1194 mg O .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. d[day]-1 with the maximum occurring during the spring bloom. Net zooplankton respiration rates in Findley Lake ranged from 27 mg O .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. d-1 under ice cover to a maximum of 205 mg O .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. d-1, which occurred well after the bloom. Respiration rates estimated from ETS activity agreed well with those estimated from zooplankton species abundance. Zooplankton community respiration never exceeded 60% of primary production in Lake Washington. In Findley Lake zooplankton community respiration rates exceeded primary production during the latter part of the ice-free growing season. P regeneration rates calculated from zooplankton respiration appeared sufficient to supply most of the phytoplankton P requirement during summer stratification in Lake Washington.

J	Ng'ethe, J; Jalilinasrabady, S				Ng'ethe, John; Jalilinasrabady, Saeid			GIS-based AHP model for selecting the best direct use scenarios for medium to low enthalpy geothermal resources with hot springs in central and Western Kenya	GEOTHERMICS												Medium to low enthalpy geothermal resources (MLEGRs) in various Eastern African countries, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, and Malawi, have received little attention from policymakers in the energy sector. Policymakers from these countries prioritize developing high-enthalpy resources for electric power production. Hence, many MLEGRs remain unused since they are assumed to pose higher risks of drilling unproductive deep wells. Besides, funding institutions prioritize high-enthalpy geothermal resources. Some MLEGRs have warm-to-hot springs with considerable flow rates and chemical constituents with varying concentrations. This study introduces a novel approach, using hydrogeochemical analysis of hot spring waters and a GIS-based AHP model, to select the best direct use scenarios for the warm/hot springs emanating from MLEGRs in central and western Kenya. The model is validated by contemporary commercial usage of the hot springs and similar studies in the study area. The stable isotope analysis revealed that the hydrothermal systems in Kenya are majorly recharged by meteoric water. In contrast, Kenya Rift Valley endorheic lakes, such as Lake Naivasha, Lake Nakuru, Lake Magadi, Lake Baringo, Lake Bogoria, and Lake Turkana, partly recharge some. Hence, they pose low risks of drying up during development and exploitation for thermal energy. The over 150 hot springs in Kenya produce warm to hot water with a thermal capacity of over 275 MWt. Hence, by harnessing the hot spring resources, Kenya can raise its direct use capacity from the current 18.5 MWt to about 100-200 MWt without drilling shallow or deep wells. The hot springs best suited for domestic use and aquacultural pond heating were selected as Narosura, Majimoto, Olchorro, Kipsegon, Kijabe, and Eburru. Those best suited for spas, bathing/ swimming pools, and volcanic geotourism were Lake Bogoria, Arus, Homa Hills, and Kariandusi. Overall, Lake Bogoria, Homa Hills, and Narosura hot springs were rated the best for direct use of hot springs.																			0375-6505	1879-3576				SEP	2024	122								103069	10.1016/j.geothermics.2024.103069	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geothermics.2024.103069		JUN 2024											WOS:001250131900001
J	Kim, SM; Kim, HS				Kim, Su-mi; Kim, Hyun-su			Assessment of Trophic Responses of a Reservoir to Seasonal and Annual Variations in Monsoon	WATER												The variations in water quality parameters and trophic status of a multipurpose reservoir in response to changing intensity of monsoon rain was investigated by applying a trophic state index deviation (TSID) analysis and an empirical regression model to the data collected in two periods from 2014 to 2017. The reservoir in general maintained mesotrophic conditions, and Carlson's trophic state index (TSIc) was affected most by TSITP. Nutrient concentrations, particularly phosphorus, did not show strong correlations with precipitation, particularly in the period with weak monsoon, and a significant increase in total phosphorus (TP) was observed in Spring 2015, indicating the possibility of internal phosphorus loading under decreased depth and stability of water body due to a lack of precipitation. TSIChl was higher than TSISD in most data in period 1 when a negligible increase in precipitation was observed in the monsoon season while a significant fraction in period 2 showed the opposite trend. Phytoplankton growth was not limited by nutrient limitation although nutrient ratios (N/P) of most samples were significantly higher than 20, indicating phosphorus-limited condition. TSID and regression analysis indicated that phytoplankton growth was limited by zooplankton grazing in the Spring, and that cell concentrations and community structure in the monsoon and post-monsoon season were controlled by the changing intensity of the monsoon, as evidenced by the positive and negative relationships between community size and cyanobacterial population with the amount of precipitation in the Summer, respectively. The possibility of contribution from internal loading and an increase in cyanobacterial population associated with weak monsoon, in addition to potential for nutrient enrichment in the post-monsoon season, implies a need for the application of more stringent water quality management in the reservoir that can handle all potential scenarios of eutrophication.

The experiment started with a streaky tracer injection of 1 liter gaseous SF6 (STP) in August 1990. At that time the lake showed a typical strong summer stratification which in a weakened form lasts until November, From the SF6 profiles of fifteen surveys at three sampling sites vertical diffusivities K-z, are calculated compensating internal seiche displacement and horizontal tracer loss. Except of the bottom region no sampling site or time period is marked by significant differences in the hypolimnic K-z profile. So vertical mixing in the whole Uberlingersee is described by mean diffusivities decreasing from 1.7 cm(2)/s at 120 m depth to 0.4 cm(2)/s in 30 m. The minimal value of 0.3 cm(2)/s in the thermocline region at 20 m depth is only based on observations in autumn. For a strong summer stratification it is certainly lower. The gradient-flux-method for heat was applied to compute a mean K-z (T) profile from continuously measured temperature profiles. Significant differences resulting from the two tracers showed, that the K-z (T) Values are underestimated by up to a factor of 5 if cooling by lateral exchange is neglected. Particularly, internal seiche pumping of colder water from the adjacent Lake Obersee over the separating sill of Mainau into the deep Uberlingersee basin is observed in 1990 from August onward, obviously controlling the heat budget below the sill level.																			1015-1621						1994	56	4					329	347		10.1007/BF00877180	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00877180													WOS:A1994PV82500002

Major chemical and isotopic compositions of the water were analyzed. Significant increases of sulfate ion are observed in several springs where the thickness of ejecta exceeds 32 mm. A good relationship of Cl/S mole ratios between spring water and leachate of the ejecta is observed. Sulfur isotopic compositions of the spring water become close to that of leachate of the ejecta as time elapses after the eruption. Consequently the sources of the added sulfate ion in the spring water after the eruption are interpreted to be anhydrite and adhered sulfur of the ejecta.																			0033-4553	1420-9136				APR	2006	163	4					809	823		10.1007/s00024-006-0042-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00024-006-0042-1													WOS:000237326000012

Age-0 trout subjected to simulated winter starvation conditions gradually depleted lipid reserves to a critical minimum lipid content below which death occurred. Small fish with lower lipid content exhausted lipid reserves earlier, and experienced high mortality rates sooner, than larger fish with greater lipid content. Consequently, winter starvation endurance was dependent upon size-dependent lipid reserves and winter duration. To validate the laboratory findings in the field, we stocked several size classes of hatchery-raised trout with known lipid content at the start of winter into two experimental lakes, and estimated survival and lipid depletion at winter's end. Larger age-0 trout had greater initial lipid reserves than smaller trout. Individuals depleted most of their lipid reserves over the winter, and experienced mortality that ranged from just under 60% for the largest individuals to just over 90% of the smallest individuals. Many survivors had lipid contents near, but none were below, the minimum lipid content determined in the laboratory.

Mixing of Rhone River water in Lake Geneva: Seasonal tracing using stable isotope composition of water	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH					Joint Conference of the European Large Lakes Symposium (ELLS) / Conference of the International-Association-for-Great-Lakes-Research (IAGLR) - Big Lakes - Small World	2019	Univ Savoie Mont Blanc, Alpine Ctr Res Troph Networks & Limn Ecosystems, Evian, FRANCE	French Natl Res Inst Agr Food & Ennvironm, Int Assoc Great Lakes Res	Univ Savoie Mont Blanc, Alpine Ctr Res Troph Networks & Limn Ecosystems			Determining the path of river intrusions into lakes is essential, both for a better understanding of the lake circulation as well as the nutrient transport and the distribution of pollutants introduced by the rivers. The objective of this study is to understand the mixing of Rhone River water within Lake Geneva. The stable H- and 0-isotope composition of water for this alpine lake has been shown to be a powerful tool to trace the Rhone River intrusion within the lake, but the details of this interflow and how it changes in space and time have not been well established yet. The present study focusses on using the isotopic tracer method in detailed cross-sections sampled at different times during the year as a tool to determine how the interflow changes with time. Different sampled cross-sections present large spatiotemporal heterogeneities of the Rhone River water dispersion. During summer and early autumn, when the lake is thermally stratified, the Rhone River is intruding into the metalimnion as an interflow, and it is directed by the currents in the top layer. The stronger the thermal stratification, the more concentrated and vertically constrained will also be the Rhone interflow. Vertical and horizontal displacements of the interflow are controlled by wind-induced internal waves and the gyres within the lake established as a function of wind strengths and directions.

The omul morphotypes differed in size and age structure, maturation age, diet composition in younger and middle age-groups, and the frequency of occurrence of Contracaecum larvae in older age-groups. The highest invasion level was found in mature individuals during spawning. The appearance of the nematode later in the life of the fish, as well as a slow, age-biased dispersal of the nematode in the Lake Baikal omul was correlated with increased piscivory in the older fish. It is unlikely that omul acquired C. osculatum baicalensis larvae directly from intermediate invertebrate hosts, and the frequency of parasites in the different morphotypes of mature omul depended on the different ages of the individuals in each morphotype with a consequent, unequal degree of piscivory among fish of different ages.

Results indicate that wind forcing over an isothermal lake results in nearly steady near-surface flow patterns directed at approximately right angles to the wind direction. Surface heat flux forcing without wind stresses results in the formation of multiple, unsteady gyres. The sense of rotation of these gyres is generally cyclonic during the summer months, and anticyclonic during winter months. These thermally forced flow patterns become more complex when wind forcing is added, and appear dependent on the wind duration, direction, and speed.																					978-0-88986-617-1				2006							19	24																WOS:000246359900004

Processes that lead to trona precipitation are poorly understood compared to those in sulphate-dominated and chloride-dominated lake brines. Nasikie Engida (Little Magadi) in the southern Kenya Rift shows the initial stages of soda evaporite formation. This small shallow (<2 m deep; 7 km long) lake is recharged by alkaline hot springs and seasonal runoff but unlike neighbouring Lake Magadi is perennial. This study aims to understand modern sedimentary and geochemical processes in Nasikie Engida and to assess the importance of geothermal fluids in evaporite formation. Perennial hot-spring inflow waters along the northern shoreline evaporate and become saturated with respect to nahcolite and trona, which precipitate in the southern part of the lake, up to 6 km from the hot springs. Nahcolite (NaHCO3) forms bladed crystals that nucleate on the lake floor. Trona (Na2CO3 center dot NaHCO3 center dot 2H(2)O) precipitates from more concentrated brines as rafts and as bottom-nucleated shrubs of acicular crystals that coalesce laterally to form bedded trona. Many processes modify the fluid composition as it evolves. Silica is removed as gels and by early diagenetic reactions and diatoms. Sulphate is depleted by bacterial reduction. Potassium and chloride, of moderate concentration, remain conservative in the brine. Clastic sedimentation is relatively minor because of the predominant hydrothermal inflow. Nahcolite precipitates when and wherepCO(2)is high, notably near sublacustrine spring discharge. Results from Nasikie Engida show that hot spring discharge has maintained the lake for at least 2 kyr, and that the evaporite formation is strongly influenced by local discharge of carbon dioxide. Brine evolution and evaporite deposition at Nasikie Engida help to explain conditions under which ancient sodium carbonate evaporites formed, including those in other East African rift basins, the Eocene Green River Formation (western USA), and elsewhere.

Zooplankton excretion and respiration rates were measured for the copepod Boeckella propinqua and excretion rate also for the zooplankton community. Photosynthetic 14C uptake was measured to estimate phytoplankton nitrogen requirements. Highest metabolic rates were found in spring and summer in both lakes. In eutrophic Lake Rotongaio, metabolic rates were closely correlated with temperature. In Taupo, a large oligotrophic lake, food supply was also an important variable. The atomic O:N ratio (oxygen consumption:nitrogen excretion) indicated protein utilisation for B. propinqua from Lake Rotongaio but an alteration between protein and stored lipids for Lake Taupo specimens. The potential contribution of nitrogen regeneration by zooplankton excretion to phytoplankton nutrient requirements was greatest during early stratification in both lakes when zooplankton biomass was greatest (up to 160% of estimated requirements in Lake Rotongaio and 214% in Lake Taupo).

Rapid Formation of an Ice Doline on Amery Ice Shelf, East Antarctica	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Surface meltwater accumulating on Antarctic ice shelves can drive fractures through to the ocean and potentially cause their collapse, leading to increased ice discharge from the continent. Implications of increasing surface melt for future ice shelf stability are inadequately understood. The southern Amery Ice Shelf has an extensive surface hydrological system, and we present data from satellite imagery and ICESat-2 showing a rapid surface disruption there in winter 2019, covering similar to 60 km(2). We interpret this as an ice-covered lake draining through the ice shelf, forming an ice doline with a central depression reaching 80 m depth amidst over 36 m uplift. Flexural rebound modeling suggests 0.75 km(3) of water was lost. We observed transient refilling of the doline the following summer with rapid incision of a narrow meltwater channel (20 m wide and 6 m deep). This study demonstrates how high-resolution geodetic measurements can explore critical fine-scale ice shelf processes.					; Warner, Roland/ISS-2485-2023; Arndt, Philipp/AAG-4254-2021	Fricker, Helen Amanda/0000-0002-0921-1432; Arndt, Philipp/0000-0002-4759-5166; Warner, Roland/0000-0002-9778-3544													0094-8276	1944-8007				JUL 28	2021	48	14							e2020GL091095	10.1029/2020GL091095	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020GL091095								34433993					WOS:000711496700065

The population of Crooked Lake was studied in detail from July 1990 - March 1991. Limited samples were also obtained from Heard Island (sub-Antarctic). Obligate parthenogenesis involving the production of subitaneous eggs appears to be the case. No males occurred. The overwintering populations of continental Antarctica consist mainly of adult females containing extensive fat reserves. The main reproductive effort occurs in spring, some females produce a smaller second brood during the summer. Reproductive output increases with adult size which is related to the nutrient status of the lake and its productivity. The Heard Island populations have a higher weight to length ratio than the Vestfold populations and have a much greater reproductive output.																			0722-4060					MAR	1992	11	8					631	635																WOS:A1992HN49900015

Impact of domestic sewage on fresh water body	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												In the present study, various (physico-chemical) factors were assessed over a period of two years (from February 2002 to January 2004) to note the chemistry and quality of tank water in Bhalki town of Bidar. Physico-chemical factors like pH, dissolved oxygen, magnesium, chlorine, nitrite, sulphates and chemical oxygen demand were found with maximum concentration during summer season. Similarly, during monsoon season free carbon dioxide, alkalinity, hardness, calcium, phosphate, silicon, total solids and biological oxygen demand; and in winter season organic matter were recorded. The concentrations viz., pH, hardness and nitrite were more compared to the potable water standard of WHO. The correlation matrix and dendrogram of physico-chemical factors have been computed and analysed. The positive co-relation coefficient observed between pH and magnesium, dissolved oxygen and hardness, free carbondioxide and calcium, alkalinity and nitrite, alkalinity and phosphate, alkalinity and biological oxygen demand, hardness and calcium, hardness and magnesium, magnesium and chlorine, nitrate and phosphate, nitrite and biological oxygen demand, phosphate and organic matter and silicon and chemical oxygen demand. The dendrogram confirms chlorine, pH, hardness, silicon, total solids and sulphates are the key factors of the change in the chemistry of water body.																			0254-8704					MAY	2008	29	3					303	308											18972682					WOS:000256207900006
J	BLOESCH, J				BLOESCH, J			INSHORE-OFFSHORE SEDIMENTATION DIFFERENCES RESULTING FROM RESUSPENSION IN THE EASTERN BASIN OF LAKE ERIE	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												From June-Oct. 1978 sediment traps were moored at 3 stations in an inshore-offshore transect in the Eastern Basin of Lake Erie. Settling fluxes measured with the traps exposed close to lake bottom were similar at all 3 stations suring summer stratification, averaging 6.1 g .cntdot. m-2.cntdot.day-1 for dry weight, 293 mg .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. day-1 for particulate organic C (POC), 38 mg .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. day-1 for particulate N (PN), and 5.44 mg .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. day-1 for particulate P (PP). A comparison of the hypolimnetic traps with the epilimnetic traps at the offshore station indicated that considerable resuspension takes place even in summer. During fall the nearshore sedimentation rates markedly increased because of storm-induced bottom resuspension. By comparing the trap catches with sediment cores taken at all 3 stations, a resuspension model for dry weight, POC and PN was developed. The calculations showed that newly formed organic material is resuspended and redeposited more frequently at nearshore locations than offshore. This repeated nearshore resuspension enhances decomposition of detritus, as shown by low relative phytoplankton activity in the hypolimnetic traps, and results in horizontal transport of fine-grained organic matter in the offshore direction. The significant POC and PN concentration differences found in the inshore-offshore transect of the bottom sediments can be explained by these 2 processes.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1982	39	5					748	759		10.1139/f82-103	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f82-103													WOS:A1982NR23500010

Habitat alters the effect of false starts on seasonal-wetland invertebrates	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Climate change is modifying the timing of the onset of winter rainfall in southern Australia, at times creating brief inundation events in seasonal wetlands, termed false starts'. False starts may cause abortive hatchings of fauna emerging from sediment egg banks because wetlands dry out before invertebrates can complete their life cycle or reach a drying-resistant life stage. A laboratory emergence experiment was used to determine whether the abortive hatching caused by false starts alters assemblage composition in the subsequent hydroperiod and whether the length of the dry period following a false start alters subsequent assemblage composition. Sediment for the experiment was collected from Lake Joondalup South, Swan Coastal Plain (SCP), Western Australia, because it has a relatively diverse assemblage of desiccation-resistant invertebrate propagules. Most wetlands on the SCP are seasonal and groundwater fed and the region has a mediterranean-type climate Two different habitat types, open water (OW) and fringing trees (FT), with distinct freshwater invertebrate assemblages are commonly found in SCP wetlands. We repeated the experiment in sediment from both habitats to determine whether false starts had the same effect on the two assemblages. Replicate sediment samples from both habitats were placed in microcosms randomly allocated to treatments or controls. To simulate false starts of differing dry-period duration, treatments were inundated for 5 days, then allowed to dry out for different time periods (10, 20 and 30days) and then inundated for 5 days. Controls were inundated for time periods equivalent to the total duration of each false-start treatment (20, 30 and 40days). FT sediment had higher organic matter and moisture content than OW sediment. The composition of the emerging assemblage differed between habitats, and emergence was slower from OW than FT sediment. Abortive hatching followed the false start in OW sediment, but subsequently the same assemblage emerged, showing reliance on the egg bank to resupply lost populations. Abortive hatching was not observed in FT sediment, where invertebrates survived drying during the false start, continuing to develop for up to 30days without surface water, because those sediments retained moisture. Provided that winter-spring hydroperiods continue to inundate OW for several months, these results indicate that invertebrates will be able to complete their life cycles and replenish egg banks following abortive hatching, demonstrating resilience to false starts. False starts to winter inundation rarely occur more than a month prior to the start of true' winter rains, so FT assemblages are resistant to false starts, showing the ability to survive dry periods of up to 30days. Furthermore, survival in damp FT sediment also gave these populations a head start', because the surviving assemblage was identical to the continuously inundated control. Assemblages emerging from beneath FT may potentially recolonise inundated OW habitat. So far, changes to SCP seasonal-wetland hydroperiods will be within the coping range of their invertebrate assemblages. As FT assemblages were more resistant to false starts, restoration schemes that increase shading by fringing vegetation should be encouraged.

In order to understand its mechanism, there has been a long-term measurement campaign, based on the rawinsonde measurements for every snowfall event at Gangneung since 2014. The previous observations showed that a typical heavy snowfall is generally accompanied with northerly or northeasterly flow below the snow clouds, generated by cold air outbreak over the relatively warmer East Sea. An intensive and multi-institutional measurement campaign has been launched in 2019 mainly in collaboration with Gangwon Regional Office of Meteorology and National Institute of Meteorological Studies of Korean Meteorological Administration, with a special emphasis on winter snowfall and spring windstorm altogether. The experiment spanned largely from February to April with comprehensive measurements of frequent rawinsonde measurements at a super site (Gangneung) with continuous remote sensings of wind profiler, microwave radiometers and weather radar etc. Additional measurements were added to the campaign, such as aircraft dropsonde measurements and shipboard rawinsonde soundings. One of the fruitful outcomes is, so far, to identify a couple of cold air damming occurrences, featuring lowest temperature below 1 km, which hamper the convergence zone and snow clouds from penetrating inland, and eventually make it harder to forecast snowfall in terms of its location and timing. This kind of comprehensive observation campaign with continuous remote sensings and intensive additional measurement platforms should be conducted to understand various orographic precipitation in the complex terrain like Yeongdong.

Identification of a Potential Toxic Hot Spot Associated with AVS Spatial and Seasonal Variation	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												In risk assessment of aquatic sediments, much attention is paid to the difference between acid-volatile sulfide (AVS) and simultaneously extracted metals (SEMs) as indicators of metal availability. Ten representative sampling sites were selected along the estuary of the Guadalete River. Surficial sediments were sampled in winter and summer to better understand SEM and AVS spatial and seasonal distributions and to establish priority risk areas. Total SEM concentration (I SEM) pound ranged from 0.3 to 4.7 mu mol g(-1). It was not significantly different between seasons, however, it showed a significant difference between sampling stations. AVS concentrations were much more variable, showing significant spatial and temporal variations. The values ranged from 0.8 to 22.4 mu mol g(-1). The SEM/AVS ratio was found to be < 1 at all except one station located near the mouth of the estuary. The results provided information on a potential pollution source near the mouth of the estuary, probably associated with vessel-related activities carried out in a local harbor area located near the station.					campana, olivia/P-9207-2017; Campana, Olivia/P-9207-2017; Blasco, Julian/A-5319-2008	Campana, Olivia/0000-0002-3756-5254; Blasco, Julian/0000-0002-9750-383X													0090-4341	1432-0703				APR	2009	56	3					416	425		10.1007/s00244-008-9206-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-008-9206-6								18704251					WOS:000264461600006
J	Wang, JL; Xue, PF; Pringle, W; Yang, Z; Qian, Y				Wang, Jiali; Xue, Pengfei; Pringle, William; Yang, Zhao; Qian, Yun			Impacts of Lake Surface Temperature on the Summer Climate Over the Great Lakes Region	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The surface of the Great Lakes interacts with the atmosphere, influencing the weather and climate over the Great Lakes Region (GLR). However, most climate models were not designed with sufficient emphasis on lake-atmosphere interactions, which could potentially cause model biases over the GLR. To understand how lake surface temperature (LST) affects the regional summer climate over the GLR, we conducted twin experiments using the Weather Research and Forecasting model at a spatial resolution of 4 km using two different LST data sets as the bottom boundary condition over the Great Lakes. Our simulations include 10 ensemble members for the summer of 2018 and a single multiyear run for the summers of 2014-2020. Results show that variations in LST influence atmospheric temperature and moisture at a local scale-while affecting the convective environment and precipitation processes over a much larger spatial scale. In particular, an LST that is only 1 degrees C-3 degrees C warmer (depending on the lake) increases near-surface air temperature by 1.93 degrees C and 0.97 degrees C over Lake Superior and Lake Erie, respectively, and increases evaporation over the lakes by 0.23 and 1.1 mm day(-1). The warmer LST reduces mesoscale convective precipitation upstream of the GLR; however, it increases isolated deep convective precipitation and nonconvective precipitation downstream of GLR due to increased local instability and enhancement of moisture transport. Our analyses confirm the robustness of these impacts, which is at least 2 times larger than the model internal variability and is seen across all simulated summer seasons.

However, the Holocene interactions among the EAWM, EN activities, and tropical Pacific precipitation remain unclear due to the lack of appropriate EAWM proxies. Here, we present high-resolution grain size records from the East China Sea shelf along with a transient climate model simulation to study the Holocene EAWM evolution and compare the findings with paleo-EN precipitation-related proxies records. The millennial-scale oscillations of grain size records, which are indicative of the intensity of the EAWM-driven coastal current, reveal an anti-phase coupling between the EAWM and EN-related tropical Pacific precipitation on a millennial timescale since 5.8 ka. These results, which are consistent with simulation results, indicate that the intensified EAWM could not only reduce equatorial western Pacific precipitation by reducing the sea surface temperature but also likely change boundary conditions in the tropical Pacific (i.e., the east-west Pacific temperature gradient and westerly anomaly) to favor the formation of subsequent intensive EN activities. The enhanced EN activities, inferred by the positive tropical eastern Pacific precipitation anomalies, could subsequently suppress the EAWM through anomalous low-level anticyclones and associated southerly anomalies, thereby generating intensified tropical western Pacific (mainly tropical monsoon areas) precipitation. Our study highlights these intrinsic interactions during the mid- to late Holocene and has useful implications for understanding this millennial-scale climate oscillation, which may represent periodic atmospheric exchange between high- and low-latitude climate systems by mediating the EAWM.

The crustaceans has been shown to inhabit moist sands above the water edge with granule sizes from 0.45 to 1.35 mm.

Mature D. eulitoralis females of not more than 350 mcm in length and of maximal fecundity of eggs per female were meet in the psammal in summer and in autumn, with a time interval as long as 1.5 months, what indicates that the species has two life cycles a year.

Sediment transport processes across the Tibetan Plateau inferred from robust grain-size end members in lake sediments	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Grain-size distributions offer powerful proxies of past environmental conditions that are related to sediment sorting processes. However, they are often of multimodal character because sediments can get mixed during deposition. To facilitate the use of grain size as palaeoenvironmental proxy, this study aims to distinguish the main detrital processes that contribute to lacustrine sedimentation across the Tibetan Plateau using grain-size end-member modelling analysis. Between three and five robust grain-size end-member subpopulations were distinguished at different sites from similarly-likely end-member model runs. Their main modes were grouped and linked to common sediment transport and depositional processes that can be associated with contemporary Tibetan climate (precipitation patterns and lake ice phenology, gridded wind and shear stress data from the High Asia Reanalysis) and local catchment configurations. The coarse sands and clays with grain-size modes > 250 mu m and < 2 mu m were probably transported by fluvial processes. Aeolian sands (similar to 200 mu m) and coarse local dust (similar to 60 mu m), transported by saltation and in near-surface suspension clouds, are probably related to occasional westerly storms in winter and spring. Coarse regional dust with modes similar to 25 mu m may derive from near-by sources that keep in longer term suspension. The continuous background dust is differentiated into two robust end members (modes: 5-10 and 2-5 mu m) that may represent different sources, wind directions and/or sediment trapping dynamics from long-range, upper-level westerly and episodic northerly wind transport. According to this study grain-size end members of only fluvial origin contribute small amounts to mean Tibetan lake sedimentation (19 +/- 5%), whereas local to regional aeolian transport and background dust deposition dominate the clastic sedimentation in Tibetan lakes (contributions: 42 +/- 14% and 51 +/- 11%). However, fluvial and alluvial reworking of aeolian material from nearby slopes during summer seems to limit end-member interpretation and should be cross-checked with other proxy information. If not considered as a stand-alone proxy, a high transferability to other regions and sediment archives allows helpful reconstructions of past sedimentation history.					; Opitz, Stephan/N-3577-2016; Maussion, Fabien/B-9814-2013; Dietze, Elisabeth/AFJ-4450-2022; Haberzettl, Torsten/AAV-9216-2021	Haberzettl, Torsten/0000-0002-6975-9774; Dietze, Elisabeth/0000-0003-4817-8441; Maussion, Fabien/0000-0002-3211-506X; Hartmann, Kai/0000-0003-2540-6798; Diekmann, Bernhard/0000-0001-5129-3649; Opitz, Stephan/0000-0003-0416-542X													1814-9324	1814-9332					2014	10	1					91	106		10.5194/cp-10-91-2014	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-10-91-2014													WOS:000333837600007

This paper investigates environmental conditions and photosynthesis in these weed-beds in two contrasting lakes, Lake Rotorua and Lake Taupo. There was no clear seasonal pattern in weed-bed biomass which ranged from 294 to 424 g (dry weight) m(-2) in Lake Taupo and from 165 to 265 g (dry weight) m(-2) in Lake Rotorua. The proportion of the total biomass in the top 50 cm of the weed-beds (Canopy Index) was between 13 and 68%, with lowest values in spring. Leaf area ratio (LAR) and chlorophyll a were maximal in the canopy just below the weed-bed surface, with LAR values of up to 450 cm(-2) g(-1) (dry weight). The depths into the weed-bed at which the 1% light level occurred were between 1.0 and 2.7 m in Lake Taupo, and 0.5 and 1.05 m in Lake Rotorua. Minimum chlorophyll a values occurred in winter with summer canopy values greater than 800 mg m(-2). Up to 50% of the chlorophyll a was located in the stems. variability in temperatures was less than expected and little vertical stratification was recorded. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) levels were very different between the two lakes, 0.08-0.42 mM (1-5 g m(-3)) in Lake Rotorua vs 0.42-0.92 mM (5-11 g m(-3)) in Lake Taupo. Speciation of the carbon would be expected to differ between the sites owing to differing pH values which were usually below 7.5 in Lake Rotorua and above 7.5 in Lake Taupo. Light saturated photosynthetic rates reported as per unit dry weight, chlorophyll a or leaf area were much lower in Lake Rotorua than Lake Taupo. Depletion of DIC and CO2 occurred over the day in the canopy of the Lake Rotorua weed-bed. This led to a virtual cessation of photosynthesis in the afternoons on four occasions. It is possible that utilisation of HCO3- in Lake Taupo prevented carbon limitation of photosynthesis at that site.

Hydrological drivers of record-setting water level rise on Earth's largest lake system	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Between January 2013 and December 2014, water levels on Lake Superior and Lake Michigan-Huron, the two largest lakes on Earth by surface area, rose at the highest rate ever recorded for a 2 year period beginning in January and ending in December of the following year. This historic event coincided with below-average air temperatures and extensive winter ice cover across the Great Lakes. It also brought an end to a 15 year period of persistently below-average water levels on Lakes Superior and Michigan-Huron that included several months of record-low water levels. To differentiate hydrological drivers behind the recent water level rise, we developed a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routine for inferring historical estimates of the major components of each lake's water budget. Our results indicate that, in 2013, the water level rise on Lake Superior was driven by increased spring runoff and over-lake precipitation. In 2014, reduced over-lake evaporation played a more significant role in Lake Superior's water level rise. The water level rise on Lake Michigan-Huron in 2013 was also due to above-average spring runoff and persistent over-lake precipitation, while in 2014, it was due to a rare combination of below-average evaporation, above-average runoff and precipitation, and very high inflow rates from Lake Superior through the St. Marys River. We expect, in future research, to apply our new framework across the other Laurentian Great Lakes, and to Earth's other large freshwater basins as well.					; Qian, Song/I-6544-2012; Fortin, Vincent/H-3645-2014	Qian, Song/0000-0002-2346-4903; Bruxer, Jacob/0000-0002-8994-1522; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				MAY	2016	52	5					4026	4042		10.1002/2015WR018209	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015WR018209													WOS:000379259800043
J	Garneau, ME; Posch, T; Pernthaler, J				Garneau, Marie-Eve; Posch, Thomas; Pernthaler, Jakob			Seasonal patterns of microcystin-producing and non-producing Planktothrix rubescens genotypes in a deep pre-alpine lake	HARMFUL ALGAE												The filamentous cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens produces secondary metabolites called microcystins (MC) that are potent toxins for most eukaryotes, including zooplankton grazers, cattle and humans. P. rubescens occurs in many deep and thermally stratified lakes throughout Europe. In Lake Zurich (Switzerland), it re-appeared in the 1970s concomitant with decreasing eutrophication. Since then, P. rubescens has become the dominant species in this major drinking water reservoir, where it forms massive metalimnetic blooms during late summer. These cyanobacteria harbor subpopulations of non-MC producers, but little is known about the environmental factors affecting the success of such genotypes. The non-MC-producing subpopulation of P. rubescens was studied using a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay on the MC synthetase (mcy) gene cluster that targets a deletion on the mcyH and mcyA genes, which inactivates MC biosynthesis. Two complementary qPCR assays were used to assess the total population abundance (based on the 16S rDNA gene) and the mcy gene copy number (based on a conserved region in the adenylation domain of the mcyB gene). The objective was to evaluate the seasonal patterns of the share of non-MC-producing filaments in the total P. rubescens population. The mcyHA mutants were present in low proportions (up to 14%) throughout the year. Their highest relative abundances occurred during the winter mixis, when total concentrations of P. rubescens were minimal. The MC deficient mutants seemed to better survive in sparse populations, possibly because of lower grazing pressure and a consequently reduced need for MG-mediated protection. Alternatively, the mutants might cope better with the sub-optimal, stressful pressure and light conditions during the winter mixis. Altogether, our results suggest that subtle trade-offs might seasonally determine the proportions of non-MC producers within P. rubescens populations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Though the lakes differed considerably in size, depth, and history of experimental disturbance (fish introductions, fertilization, plankton harvesting), these differences apparently had much less influence on seasonal abundance patterns than did interannual variation in environmental factors shared by all the lakes. Spring rates of population increase differed strongly among years and were positively correlated between the two species. The timing and magnitude of summer population maxima also differed significantly among years, but were not correlated between the species. Adult mortality rates tended to increase through each season for both species, but showed no clear correlations either between the species or between years. Annual differences in growth and mortality rates and peak abundances were not associated with any obvious differences in environmental factors (insolation, rainfall, water temperature). There was no evidence of direct competition between the species, in terms of negative correlations in abundance. This is surprising in view of their similar life histories and feeding ecologies.

The industrial utilization of the lake resulted in substantial density differences between the inflows and the lake. Inflows carrying substantial fractions of industrial ionic waste were more dense than the lake, and at times plunged to stratified layers. Water withdrawn from the lower layers of the lake for industrial cooling was displaced to the upper layers as a result of heating. Dilute fluvial inflows were substantially less dense than the lake. The density differences between the inflows and the lake were largely responsible for the rather unique features of density stratification documented for the lake in 1980, and are probably of further importance in nutrient loading to, and cycling in, Onondaga Lake.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				MAR	1986	28	1-2					105	115																WOS:A1986A322700007

Body measurements and weights of fat deposits were obtained for 35 greater scaup and 39 lesser scaup. Carcasses were homogenized and analyzed for lipid and water content. Percent body water and skin weight were the best predictors of ether-extractable body lipids. Body weight and body weight/body length were good predictors of ether-extractable lipids but may provide less reliable estimates if used for scaup at other stages of their annual cycle. Only abdominal fat weight could be used to derive a single predictive equation estimating ether-extractable lipids for both species.

Estimation of Nitrogen and Sulfur Dry Deposition over the Watershed of Lake Paldang	JOURNAL OF KOREAN SOCIETY FOR ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Lake Paldang is a main resource of drinking water for 20 million people in the greater Seoul area. Dry deposition amounts of nitrogen and sulfur were estimated for three typical days in each season over the watershed of Lake Paldang. Models-3/CMAQ (Community Multiscale Air Quality) and MM5 (Mesoscale Model) were used to predict air quality and meteorology, respectively. Aerosols as well as gaseous pollutants were considered. Nitrogen was mainly deposited in the form of HNO3 while most of sulfur was deposited in the form of SO2. Contribution of secondary pollutants was the largest in fall since they were transported from the greater Seoul area. However, contribution of secondarily-formed particulate pollutants to the nitrogen deposition was the largest in winter because semi-volatile ammonium nitrate favors lower temperature. Annual deposition amounts of nitrogen and sulfur were 37% and 26% of their emission amounts, respectively, over the watershed of Lake Paldang. Higher value of the nitrogen deposition showed a more influence of pollutants emitted in the greater Seoul area.																			1598-7132	2383-5346				FEB	2005	21	1					49	62																WOS:000410176800005
J	Yeo, HG; Choi, M; Sunwoo, Y				Yeo, HG; Choi, M; Sunwoo, Y			Seasonal variations in atmospheric concentrations of organochlorine pesticides in urban and rural areas of Korea	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Atmospheric concentrations of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were measured in both rural (Ansung) and urban (Seoul) areas in Korea from July, 1999 to May, 2000. The chemicals measured in this study include heptachlor, chlordane, DDTs, hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), and endosulfan. Endosulfan and alpha-HCH, with values of a few 100s to 1000s of pg m(-3), were found to have higher concentrations than other compounds in both areas. Most OCPs showed higher concentrations in Ansung, with many potential sources, such as contaminated surfaces, relative to Seoul. The maximum and minimum concentrations of OCPs at both sites occurred in summer and winter, respectively. It can be partly explained by the variation of temperature. The correlation between atmospheric concentration and temperature was observed using Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) plots. The CC plots for most OCPs in both areas showed good linearity and steep slopes. It is hence inferred that their atmospheric concentrations might be mostly affected by re-volatilization from surfaces of local surroundings at the sampling sites. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Khan, MA				Khan, MA			Anthropogenic eutrophication and red tide outbreak in lacustrine systems of the Kashmir Himalaya	ACTA HYDROCHIMICA ET HYDROBIOLOGICA												Red tide, a recurrent phenomenon has become conspicuous in several Kashmir lake ecosystems since 1991. The responsible organism (Euglena pedunculata), a rare flagellate rediscovered in the Kashmir Himalaya (Khan 1993) caused first and unprecedented red tide outbreak, constituting a maximum of 96% of resident numerical phytoplankton density in Dal Lake. At present, conflicting hypotheses exist on the generation of causal assemblage(s) imparting redness to waters: Jeeji Bai (1991) linked its origin to acid precipitation a fallout of burning oil-fields during the Gulf War - whilst Khan (1993) holds local factor(s) responsible. Field/experimental studies support the latter contention that the influx of untreated sewage, in unison with warm temperatures, high levels of PhAR, iron and interruption to hydrological flow-pattern together with absence/or reduction in grazing activity created conducive environmental milieu for red tide outbreak. Dal Lake "red tide" drifted the bloom-inoculum to other waters, including Lake Wular, where additional ecological niches were carved out, threatening the aesthetic value and biological diversity of Kashmir lakes. Ecological monitoring indicates frequent seasonal red tide occurrence in Dal Lake (including summer-autumn event of 1998) which testifies its unabated eutrophication status. Further studies are needed on ecological adaptability and biogeographic distribution of this rare and unique red tide-causing flagellate.

In contrast, the Bar-headed Goose A. indicus wintering population in China's Tibet Autonomous Region more than doubled. During six surveys in Tibet over a 27-year period (1991/92 to 2017/18 winters) we documented an annual growth rate of 6.8% in the Bar-headed Goose population - an increase from approximately 10,100 to 68,100 birds. We propose that in addition to the cessation of hunting, the population growth of Bar-headed Goose is being driven by changes in agricultural land use patterns in Tibet, the establishment of protected areas on the wintering and breeding grounds, and the impacts of climate change across the Tibetan Plateau. Consistent with this hypothesis, the sown area of winter wheat in Tibet has increased and geese have shifted from primarily feeding in crop stubble to planted winter wheat fields. We also found that the most rapid population growth coincided with a 1998 climate regime shift across the Tibetan Plateau resulting in warmer temperatures, an increase in net precipitation, the appearance of new lakes and changes in the water levels and surface area of historical lakes. We suggest that warmer temperatures and high-quality forage on the south-central Tibet wintering grounds may be enhancing over-winter survival, while on the breeding grounds the expansion of lakes and wet meadows is augmenting breeding and brood-rearing habitat.					; YANG, Le/JPX-9862-2023; Liu, Dongping/AAW-8846-2021	Bishop, Mary Anne/0000-0001-9723-0184; 													0959-2709	1474-0001				SEP	2022	32	3					398	413	PII S0959270921000265	10.1017/S0959270921000265	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0959270921000265		JUL 2021											WOS:000743350400001

However, it is not well known how and to what extent warming affects ABs risk. In this work, with simple data input (satellite product, lake surface observation, and climate) and method structure (ensemble learning, statistical downscaling, and hierarchical clustering), a systematic lake surface water temperature (LSWT) and ABs risk evaluation system are constructed and applied in a typical eutrophic freshwater lake. The main results are as follows: 1. The warming rate of LSWT and air temperature from 2000 to 2023 reached 0.21 degrees C/10a and 0.30 degrees C/10a respectively, resulting in an extended ABs risk in the historical period. 2. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency between climate and LSWT reached 0.89, and LSWT showed a significant (p < 0.05) positive correlation with algal density. 3. The escalation of ABs risks mainly spread to spring and autumn in the forthcoming future, the adverse effect of high emission scenarios will evidently emerge in the mid-21st century. Policymakers and catchment managers should be cautious of lake warming and develop countermeasures in advance.					; Fan, Yunjiang/JVN-8849-2024; De Maeyer, Philippe/F-2985-2011; Liu, Shiyin/AAT-4278-2020	Fan, Yunjiang/0009-0005-1488-8244; Chen, Junxu/0000-0003-3464-1132; LIU, Shiyin/0000-0002-9625-7497; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				NOV	2024	643								131949	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131949	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131949		SEP 2024											WOS:001309375200001

From 1991, periodical eel mortality occured in Lake Balaton, Hungary. However, eels with a worm burden of 20 to 50 parasites did not show severe swimbladder lesions, which observation cast doubts on the primary aetiological role of the parasite in the eel kill. In order to study the pathology of the infection, from the spring of 1996 until October of the same year, 51 eels were collected from two regions of Lake Balaton and examined for swimbladder changes. To detect humoral antibodies, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed, using cuticular-oesophageal worm antigen. The results of the test show the applicability of the method. However, no direct correlation was found between antibody levels or the intensity of infection and the swimbladder lesions. The low level of specific antibodies and the increasing severity of swimbladder changes in the autumn suggest that parasite-induced immunity is insufficient to prevent reinfection.

However, little is known about the magnitude and variability of this methane source or its response to climate change. Remote-sensing detection of large gas seeps would be useful for establishing a baseline understanding of sub-permafrost methane seepage, as well as for monitoring these seeps over time. Here we explored synthetic aperture radar's (SAR) response to large sub-permafrost gas seeps in an interior Alaskan lake. In SAR scenes from 1992 to 2011, we observed high perennial SAR L-band backscatter (sigma(0)) from a similar to 90 m-wide feature in the winter ice of interior Alaska's North Blair Lake (NBL). Spring and fall optical imagery showed holes in the ice at the same location as the SAR anomaly. Through field work we (1) confirmed gas bubbling at this location from a large pockmark in the lakebed, (2) measured flux at the location of densest bubbles (1713 +/- 290 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)), and (3) determined the bubbles' methane mixing ratio (6.6%), radiocarbon age (18 470 +/- 50 years BP), and delta C-13(CH4) values (-44.5 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand), which together may represent a mixture of sources and processes. We performed a first order comparison of SAR sigma(0) from the NBL seep and other known sub-permafrost methane seeps with diverse ice/water interface shapes in order to evaluate the variability of SAR signals from a variety of seep types. Results from single-polarized intensity and polarimetric L-band SAR decompositions as well as dual-polarized C-band SAR are presented with the aim to find the optimal SAR imaging parameters to detect large methane seeps in frozen lakes. Our study indicates the potential for SAR remote sensing to be used to detect and monitor large, sub-permafrost gas seeps in Arctic and sub-Arctic lakes.

Water Chemistry in Small Tributaries and the Coastal Zone of Lake Baikal in the Period of Environmental Crisis	WATER RESOURCES												In the context of the environmental crisis observed in recent years in some areas in Baikal coastal zone, water chemistry was studied in June 2018 in seven points in this zone at different distances from populated localities and in six small tributaries of the lake. To compare data on different biological seasons lake water sampling was repeated in August-September 2019 in four previous and five additional points. Water mineralization was found to be minimal in the southern Baikal. The total mineralization of Baikal water remained relatively low, not exceeding the background values in previous decades; the concentration of environmentally hazardous elements is also low, except for the higher concentration of strontium in the thermal water of the Goryachinskii Creek. On the other hand, Baikal water in most points showed higher nitrogen content, and anomalously high phosphate concentration (0.413-0.941 mg/L) was recorded in the middle part of the lake (Barguzin Bay at Maksimikha Settl., at Svyatoi Nos Peninsula, and at Bol'shoi Ushkanii Isl.). Considerable enrichment of Baikal water by nutrients, which can provoke extremely high values of alga biomass in late summer and early autumn, was recorded not only near populated localities but also far from them and was not caused by inflow of these elements from tributaries. The sources of these pollutants are to be identified. In the late August-early September 2019, in the period of active consumption of phosphorus by summer phytoplankton and bottom algae, the concentration of phosphates in Middle Baikal decreased, remaining elevated (0.09 mg/L) near Maksimikha, but it abruptly rose (1.33 mg/L) in the thermal Goryachinskii Creek. In that period, water near Slyudyanka City (the southern part of the lake) was rich in nitrates (1.67-1.94 mg/L); their concentration was highest near Maksimikha (2.39 mg/L). The high concentration of nutrients in Baikal water requires extensive comprehensive measures to be taken to reduce the anthropogenic load onto lake ecosystem.

Assessment of the hypolimnetic withdrawal system at Pine Lake, Alberta. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XXX-XXX. In 1998, the Pine Lake Restoration Society (PLRS) installed a gravity-fed hypolimnetic withdrawal (HW) system in 4.13 km(2) Pine Lake, Alberta, which had severe cyanobacterial blooms. Under HW, median euphotic total phosphorus (TP) declined by 27-32%, and chlorophyll a by 37-41%, typical of HW projects elsewhere. Furthermore, cyanobacterial blooms were less severe during HW. Decreasing hypolimnetic TP and internal loads suggest sediment P release declined in at least the middle basin under HW. There was no evidence of increased hypolimnetic temperatures during HW, which could have enhanced sediment P release. Summer hypolimnetic anoxia declined in the middle and south basins, while in winter anoxia declined in the north and middle basins. No change in TP occurred in 9 Alberta reference lakes, and external P loadings were not reduced by management efforts at Pine Lake, which suggests improvements were due to HW. After N declined during HW in Pine Lake, cyanobacteria shifted from a diverse community with species that fix atmospheric N, and others without that capacity, to one dominated by Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. Correlation analysis found Pine Lake blooms were associated with euphotic TP, total nitrogen (TN), earlier spring ice breakup, and higher air temperatures. Due to increased rainfall, the PLRS was able to operate the system more often than predicted. Pine Lake remains productive and the goal of mesotrophic productivity was not achieved. However, the anoxia analysis suggests lake productivity should decline appreciably by 2032 with continued HW operation. HW provides an affordable option for stratified lakes with high internal P loading.

J	Haight, RG; Travis, LE; Nimerfo, K; Mech, LD				Haight, RG; Travis, LE; Nimerfo, K; Mech, LD			Computer simulation of wolf-removal strategies for animal damage control	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												Because of the sustained growth of the gray wolf (Canis lupus) population in the western Great Lakes region of the United States, management agencies are anticipating gray wolf removal from the federal endangered species list and are proposing strategies for wolf management. Strategies are needed that would balance public demand for wolf conservation with demand for protection against wolf depredation on livestock, poultry, and pets. We used a stochastic, spatially structured, individually based simulation model of a hypothetical wolf population, representing a small subset of the western Great Lakes wolves, to predict the relative performance of 3 wolf-removal strategies. Those strategies included reactive management (wolf removal occurred in summer after depredation), preventive management (wolves removed in winter from territories with occasional depredation), and population-size management (wolves removed annually in winter from all territories near farms). Performance measures included number of depredating packs and wolves removed, cost, and population size after 20 years. We evaluated various scenarios about immigration, trapping success, and likelihood of packs engaging in depredation. Four robust results emerged from the simulations: 1) each strategy reduced depredation by at least 40% compared with no action, 2) preventive and population-size management removed fewer wolves than reactive management because wolves were removed in winter before pups were born, 3) population-size management was least expensive because repeated annual removal kept most territories near farms free of wolves, and 4) none of the strategies threatened wolf populations unless they were isolated because wolf removal took place near farms and not in wild areas. For isolated populations, reactive management alone ensured conservation and reduced depredation. Such results can assist decision makers in managing gray wolves in the western Great Lakes states.																			0091-7648					FAL	2002	30	3					844	852																WOS:000178533300022

Phenology and species diversity in a Lake Huron ichthyoplankton community: Ecological implications of invasive species dominance	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Ichthyoplankton communities are dynamic and vary spatiotemporally based on factors such as wind, water currents, and phenology. Nonetheless, ichthyoplankton are an indicator of spawning success in fish populations and examining their community diversity and composition can serve to provide information on ecosystem integrity. Although some ichthyoplankton species may be transient, understanding their distribution in space and time provides information on species composition, abundance, and habitat use during critical early life stages. We sampled the spring-summer ichthyoplankton community during 2008 and 2009 in northern Lake Huron to determine species succession, abundance, and species diversity along physical and environmental gradients. Seasonal succession of species was similar during both years, indicating well-defined patterns in spawning by northern Lake Huron fish populations. Invasive alewife, rainbow smelt, and round goby were the dominant species during both years, with native stickleback species also abundant. Shannon Entropy (H') increased with increasing water temperature until late summer when H' declined. H' decreased with increasing bottom depth and distance to tributary mouth indicating the important ecological role of these habitat features during early life stages. Although ichthyoplankton diversity was comparable to or higher than that reported for other areas of the Great Lakes, the prominence of invasive species in our study is reflective of the disturbed state of the lake Huron fish community, despite large reductions in invasive planktivorous fish since 2004.

Integrating Discharge-Concentration Dynamics Across Carbon Forms in a Boreal Landscape	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The flux of terrestrial carbon across land-water boundaries influences the overall carbon balance of landscapes and the ecology and biogeochemistry of aquatic ecosystems. The local consequences and broader fate of carbon delivered to streams is determined by the overall composition of carbon inputs, including the balance of organic and inorganic forms. Yet, our understanding of how hydrologic fluxes across different land-water interfaces regulate carbon supply remains poor. We used 7 years of data from three boreal catchments to test how different land-water interfaces (i.e., forest, wetland, and lake) modulate concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane, as well as the balance among forms (e.g., DOC:CO2). Seasonal patterns in concentrations and C-Q relationships for individual carbon forms differed across catchments. DOC varied between chemostasis and transport limitation in the forest catchment, between supply limitation and chemostasis in the wetland catchment, and was persistently chemostatic in the lake outlet stream. Carbon gases were supply limited overall, but exhibited chemostasis or transport limitation in the forest and wetland catchments linked to elevated flow in summer and autumn. Unique C-Q relationships for individual forms reflected the properties of different interfaces and underpinned changes in the composition of lateral carbon supply. Accordingly, DOC dominated the carbon flux during snowmelt, whereas gas evasion increased in relative importance during other times of the year. Integrating the C-Q dynamics of individual carbon forms provides insight into the shifting composition of lateral export, and thus helps to predict how hydrologic changes may alter the fate of carbon supplied to streams.					; Laudon, Hjalmar/J-3074-2013; Gómez-Gener, Lluís/L-1332-2017; Sponseller, Ryan/ABI-7338-2020	Gomez-Gener, Lluis/0000-0003-3279-3589; Laudon, Hjalmar/0000-0001-6058-1466; Hotchkiss, Erin/0000-0001-6132-9107; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				AUG	2021	57	8							e2020WR028806	10.1029/2020WR028806	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020WR028806													WOS:000688205400062

Modelling the impact of higher temperature on the phytoplankton of a boreal lake	BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												We linked the models PROTECH and MyLake to test potential impacts of climate-changeinduced warming on the phytoplankton community of Pyhajarvi, a lake in southwest Finland. First, we calibrated the models for the present conditions, which revealed an apparent high significance of internal nutrient loading for Pyhajarvi. We then estimated the effect of two climate change scenarios on lake water temperatures and ice cover duration with MyLake. Finally, we used those outputs to drive PROTECH to predict the resultant phytoplankton community. It was evident that cyanobacteria will grow significantly better in warmer water, especially in the summer. Even if phosphorus and nitrogen loads to the lake remain the same and there is little change in the total chlorophyll a concentrations, a higher proportion of the phytoplankton community could be dominated by cyanobacteria. The model outputs provided no clear evidence that earlier ice break would advance the timing of the diatom spring bloom.

The mountain areas have abundant precipitation and glaciers that provide surface water flow to the plains and form numerous inland river systems. The hydrological regimes of the groundwater and springs, to a large extent, depend on the surface runoff. The regional hydrology and ecosystems of the Hexi Corridor region have changed over the last half century under the driving force of intense human activity. This paper aims to show the characteristics of hydrological changes resulting from human activities in the last 50 years from several points of view, such as: surface runoff changes at the mountain front and in the lower reaches of streams, both annual and inter-annual, the changes of the groundwater table and spring water volume, and temporal and spatial hydrochemical regimes. Streamflow issuing from mountains in the eastern section of the Corridor by way of the Shiyang River has decreased significantly. Annual mountain outflow from the Heihe and Shule rivers in the central and western portions of the Corridor, respectively, have tended to increase. However, river discharge in the lower reaches is decreasing, terminal lakes are contracting or drying up and water quality is getting worse due to expanding large-scale exploitation of water resources. Many small rivers disappear soon after flowing from mountain valleys, river courses are shortening, the spring water volume is continually reducing, and the groundwater table is falling in most parts of the middle and lower reaches. These hydrological changes exacerbate the water supply-demand paradox, and result in serious environmental problems. Understanding the characteristics of hydrological processes and regime change is important for driving the solutions to rational use of the limited water resources and the limiting of environmental degradation in the northwest China.

The initiation of this event correlates with exponential growth of the Synechococcus population within the lake. Synechococcus is the dominant (by similar to 4 orders of magnitude) autotrophic organism owing to the oligotrophic condition of the lake. The delta(13)C values of the dissolved inorganic C range seasonally from -9.5 parts per thousand in winter to -6.2 parts per thousand in summer due to photosynthetic activity. Calcite precipitates principally in the microenvironment surrounding Synechococcus because of a photosynthetically driven alkalization process and the availability of the cells as nucleation sites. This calcite has a heavier delta(13)C value (>4 parts per thousand) than does the dissolved inorganic C of the lake water owing to the cells preferential uptake of C-12. A conceptual model suggests that photosynthetic activity and cell surface chemistry, together with the substantial surface area that arises from the great abundance of micron-sized cells, allow Synechococcus to dominate the annual whiting events in Fayetteville Green Lake.																			0024-3590					JAN	1997	42	1					133	141											11541205					WOS:A1997XK60100013
J	PICK, FR				PICK, FR			INTERPRETATIONS OF ALKALINE-PHOSPHATASE ACTIVITY IN LAKE-ONTARIO	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) in Lake Ontario reached maximum levels of 0.25 .mu.MP released h-1 during 1982. Relatively high values were first detected in nearshore surface water in May concurrent with thermal bar development and at a later date (end of June) at a midlake station following transport of nearshore water to the middle. APA remained detectable throughout the summer but declined in mid-August as a result of upwelling events. With fall mixing, APA persisted throughout the entire water column. Additions of phosphate did not inhibit APA until enrichments were much greater than maximum ambient concentrations of soluble reactive P. The findings suggest that APA is not a sensitive indicator of P deficiency. APA activity was correlated with nanoplankton (2-20 .mu.m) plus picoplankton (0.2-2 .mu.m) biomass but not with total algal biomass. APA associated with particles greater than 12 .mu.m was relatively unimportant.

J	Murphy, NP; Guzik, MT; Wilmer, JW				Murphy, Nicholas P.; Guzik, Michelle T.; Wilmer, Jessica Worthington			The influence of landscape on population structure of four invertebrates in groundwater springs	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The unique aquatic fauna of the island-like groundwater springs of arid inland Australia raises important questions as to how aquatic species persist in very isolated and fragmented habitats and the role that dispersal may play in mitigating/mediating the influence of landscape structure and determining population structure. By determining the relationship between genetics and geography (i.e. phylogeography), the historical processes responsible for population structure can be determined. 2. We undertook comparative phylogeographic studies of invertebrates from springs south of Lake Eyre. Clusters of springs lying within and between surface drainage catchments (which provide a potential connection between springs) were sampled, and the phylogeographic structure of four coexisting species, an ostracod Ngarwa dirga, a snail Fonscochlea accepta, an isopod Phreatomerus latipes and an amphipod Wangiannachiltonia guzikae, was examined. 3. Clear differences in the geographic patterns of genetic structure were found amongst the four species. No discernable genetic structure was found in ostracod and snail populations, even amongst springs lying 20 km apart in separate surface catchments; isopod populations were highly genetically structured amongst springs located in separate catchments, but not within catchments, whilst amphipod populations were highly genetically structured amongst springs both within and between catchments. 4. The results suggest that differences in dispersal ability of each species, and not the overall fragmented nature of the springs, may have led to large differences in phylogeographic history. Interestingly, the relative dispersal ability of these species may be related to their vulnerability to and recovery from large-scale flood events. Therefore, despite the highly isolated and fragmented nature of the springs, the landscape has not strongly influenced the population structure of the aquatic invertebrate community as a whole nor has it led to the evolution of common life histories.

In late pleistocene, debris-flows repeatedly occured in this valley and brought friable adjournment to Lake Baikal and formed a cone of dejection. The Semenikha valley had experienced the effect of several strong earthquakes in holocene. Initially, a block rock slide was put forward. Subsequently, the river valley was partitioned off by a debris slide with formation of a dammed lake. A dammed lake occurs in summer during intense rainfall and by the beginning of winter when the frost-bound part under the lake is completely unfrozen and water from it infiltrates into the friable deposits. During the third earthquake, the body of the debris slide was broken up into three faults.

However, good proxy record of Eocene monsoon is rare in eastern Asia where East Asia summer monsoon prevails. Here we study middle Eocene lacustrine deposits of the Shahejie Formation in the Bohai Bay Basin in eastern China to understand middle Eocene paleoclimate and its stability. Our study integrates new delta C-13 and delta O-18 data of authigenic lacustrine carbonates, lake water salinity proxy of Mg/Ca ratio, and published carbonate minerology, chemical weathering proxy data of CIA* and Ln(Al2O3/Na2O), and lithofacies interpretations from two cores to provide new understanding of paleoclimate elements. Our results show that in most part of the record, the authigenic calcite delta O-18 values in laminated mudstone-dominated lithofacies display frequent variations, up to 2.9 parts per thousand, while Mg/Ca ratio and dolomite content remain low and nearly stable. These features suggest frequent variations of lake water level driven by changes in runoff amount because of changing intensity of summer monsoonal precipitation during the middle Eocene. The comparison of stable isotope variation with modern precipitation stable isotope record in the study area and seasonal precipitation of the laminated lithofacies both support the interpretation of seasonal climate. We interpret that the lake water and carbonate delta O-18 values decreased when the East Asia summer monsoon was strong and increased when the monsoon was weak. During two periods of the studied middle Eocene interval, the lake water experienced periodic intense evaporation, causing high Mg/Ca ratios and dolomite content, and high authigenic dolomite delta O-18 values up to 0 parts per thousand. These periodic drying events likely reflect millennial-scale droughts that are common today to the East Asia summer monsoon because of warming in the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool. We infer that the frequent droughts in the two periods of the middle Eocene were resulted from very warm climate during the two periods. We conclude that the East Asia summer monsoon existed in eastern China during the middle Eocene, and the climate state was not stable.

J	Willén, E				Willén, E			Phytoplankton and water quality characterization: Experiences from the Swedish large lakes Malaren, Hjalmaren, Vattern and Vanern	AMBIO												Phytoplankton and environmental variables have been monitored in the large Swedish lakes Malaren, Hjalmaren, Vattern and Vanern since the 1960s. Measures to reduce phosphorus input and industrial waste products were taken during the 1970s. The phosphorus loading was then reduced by 90-95% resulting in a halving of the phosphorus concentrations in the most affected basins. The phytoplankton community reacted rapidly with decreased biomasses of cyanobacteria in summer as well as decreased biomasses of spring diatoms and cryptophycean flagellates. Other reactions were a contracted period of waterbloom, an increased taxon richness, an increased evenness in the biomass over the growth season, and a change in the species size structure within the phytoplankton community. Furthermore, the species richness in the large lakes is compared in relation to lake characteristics. A presentation of the occurrence of toxic cyanobacteria in the lakes is also given. Maximum-minimum values of 13-0.1 mug microcystin L-1 are established in connection with water-blooms in Hjalmaren and Malaren. The use of phytoplankton as a monitoring variable to detect water-quality changes is outlined and assessment criteria are presented.																			0044-7447	1654-7209				DEC	2001	30	8					529	537		10.1639/0044-7447(2001)030[0529:PAWQCE]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1639/0044-7447(2001)030[0529:PAWQCE]2.0.CO;2								11878027					WOS:000173812700009

Current fluctuation components were determined by filtering the synoptic data. In order to determine the correct filter cut-off period, a statistical analysis of the filtered data was carried out. From this analysis, stationary, isotropic turbulence is found to be limited to timescales being < 0.5 days. The average mixing coefficients - eddy viscosity and eddy diffusion coefficients when limited to timescales < 0.5 days show little difference between each other. The largest values are one to two orders of magnitude below estimates from the Laurentian Great Lakes and the ocean. The observed seasonal time variation of the mean of the mixing coefficients is between about 5 10(3) cm2 s-1 in the fall and about 5 10(2) cm2 s-1 in winter. In contrast, a short term variation (over days) of three orders of magnitude is found and can be explained by the event-structure of wind forcing.																			0992-7689					APR	1993	11	4					327	339																WOS:A1993LC27100010

Turtles at Big Sand Mound, Iowa, are active (aquatic) from late April to mid-July and aestivate terrestrially from mid-July to mid-August. Some turtles might resume activity later in August and early September before winter hibernation. Turtles feed aquatically from mid-May to mid-July. This represents the shortest annual feeding period reported for a turtle. In 1979, following a severe drought, the primary diet shifted from fishes and crayfish to snails. Spring Lake, presently a temporary pond, was occupied more extensively than the semi-permanent Beatty''s Pond. The latter probably provides some stability to the system during drought years. The turtle is associated with other sand prairie relict species and has been proposed as an endangered species.																			0038-4909	1943-6262					1985	30	3					413	425		10.2307/3671274	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3671274													WOS:A1985ARX9900012
J	Rohrlack, T; Haande, S; Molversmyr, Å; Kyle, M				Rohrlack, Thomas; Haande, Sigrid; Molversmyr, Age; Kyle, Marcia			Environmental Conditions Determine the Course and Outcome of Phytoplankton Chytridiomycosis	PLOS ONE												Chytrid fungi are highly potent parasites of phytoplankton. They are thought to force phytoplankton organisms into an evolutionary arms race with high population diversity as the outcome. The underlying selection regime is known as Red Queen dynamics. However, our study suggests a more complex picture for chytrid parasitism in the cyanobacterium Planktothrix. Laboratory experiments identified a "cold thermal refuge", inside which Planktothrix can grow without chytrid infection. A field study in two Norwegian lakes underlined the ecological significance of this finding. The study utilized sediment DNA as a biological archive in combination with existing monitoring data. In one lake, temperature and light conditions forced Planktothrix outside the thermal refuge for most of the growing season. This probably resulted in Red Queen dynamics as suggested by a high parasitic pressure exerted by chytrids, an increase in Planktothrix genotype diversity over time, and a correlation between Planktothrix genotype diversity and duration of bloom events. In the second lake, a colder climate allowed Planktothrix to largely stay inside the thermal refuge. The parasitic pressure exerted by chytrids and Planktothrix genotype diversity remained low, indicating that Planktothrix successfully evaded the Red Queen dynamics. Episodic Planktothrix blooms were observed during spring and autumn circulation, in the metalimnion or under the ice. Interestingly, both lakes were dominated by the same or related Planktothrix genotypes. Taken together, our data suggest that, depending on environmental conditions, chytrid parasitism can impose distinct selection regimes on conspecific phytoplankton populations with similar genotype composition, causing these populations to behave and perhaps to evolve differently.

Nine headwater and five receiving water sites, representing both major river systems and diverse physiographic regions were sampled in the fall of 1991 and 1992, and spring of 1993. Mean filterable concentrations (range) of Cd 9.5 (4.6-26), Cu 620 (110-1800), Pb 76 (20-200), and Zn 460 (160-930) ng L-1 are comparable with recent data from oceanic, Great Lakes, and other river systems determined by researchers using modern 'clean' methods. Metal partition coefficients at each site generally followed the trend (pooled mean log K-d): Pb (5.84) > Zn (5.54) > Cd (4.92) > Cu (4.94). Order-of-magnitude differences in K(d)s were observed between sites, however, a large fraction of this variance could be explained by dissolved organic carbon (DOC) levels and degree of anthropogenic perturbation. Watershed yields of Cd, Pb, and Zn, under baseflow conditions were a very small fraction, typically 1-2%, of atmospheric loading. Copper yields represented a much higher fraction, particularly during spring high flow conditions. Filterable levels and yields of Al, Pb, and Zn are significantly higher in non-calcareous systems than in calcareous ones, which correlates with the higher levels of DOC in non-calcareous, forested systems.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				MAR	1999	110	3-4					273	311		10.1023/A:1005019521097	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1005019521097													WOS:000078945400004
J	Alvarez-Cobelas, M; Velasco, JL; Valladolid, M; Baltanás, A; Rojo, C				Alvarez-Cobelas, M; Velasco, JL; Valladolid, M; Baltanás, A; Rojo, C			Daily patterns of mixing and nutrient concentrations during early autumn circulation in a small sheltered lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Autumn circulation in lakes is currently conceived to occur very rapidly, being controlled mainly by wind-power dynamics, decreasing irradiance and heat flux. In addition, autumn mixing is usually related to nutrient redistribution in the vertical column, resulting in its overall increase. To test these assumptions, mixing and nutrient dynamics in a Spanish small, wind-sheltered, mesotrophic, seepage lake were studied daily during autumn circulation. 2. The seasonal erosion of the pycnocline in Las Madres Lake was the outcome of vertical and horizontal exchanges of heat and matter. The overall mixing of the water column lasted 3 months, which was an unexpected period for a rather shallow lake. Two periods of mixing could be envisaged until full circulation was attained. First, a slightly faster period of pycnocline deepening than that predicted by the heat flux and wind stress model of Fisher et al. (1979) occurred for 41 days, mixing most of the water column down to within two meters of the bottom. Then a much slower process took place promoting frequent instability of the bottom layer and resulting in entire mixing in a further 52 days. 3. Vertically, the whole mixing process was a response to weak surface cooling, resulting from the mild air temperatures of the semiarid climate of the area, and weak wind stress, because of low wind fetch and high shelter. Horizontally, a gravity current transporting cold, denser water from western shallower areas of the lake and materials produced by the decomposition of organic matter of littoral origin may produce a bottom layer of increased density, thus impinging on vertical stability. Seepage inputs of water of roughly constant temperature might also have increased bottom density. Bottom density enhancement resulted in a double diffusion process. 4. Only in-lake nitrogen content increased until full circulation was attained, whereas carbon showed no trend and phosphorus declined. External processes, such as seepage exchange and atmospheric deposition, coupled to internal processes, such as nitrification, oxidised phosphorus precipitation and complexation with organic carbon, might have been responsible for the areal nutrient patterns observed. 5. Our study demonstrates that current models of water column mixing and nutrient redistribution in lakes during autumn circulation must be improved to encompass the effects of external inputs, including horizontal heat and matter exchange.

Bioassay measurements, showed a strong stimulation to phytoplankton photosynthesis rates during most seasons in epilimnetic waters following microadditions of inorganic Si and Fe. Photosynthetic stimulation was additive for individual elements and synergistic when simultaneous additions were made. Marked stimulation occurred for both elements during the spring, especially in upper hypolimnetic waters (50-75 m) and correlated with dominant diatom populations. The addition of an organic chelator, nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), commonly stimulated photosynthetic rates at 150 m, considerably below the depth of optimal light availability for photosynthesis. With minor exception, the simultaneous addition of this chelator and inorganic Fe were always capable of producing stimulatory responses. Inorganic P was preferred over N and found to be more stimulatory. P stimulation was restricted to periods of spring and summer production. The addition of glucose, acetate and glycine produced positive responses, while the addition of several vitamins showed little effect except for a stimulation from microamounts of B12. The addition of 2 organic growth substances. GA and IAA, both stimulated phytoplankton photosynthesis. The results of more than 140 bioassay measurements indicate the pelagial phytoplankton are severely restricted nutritionally due to specific physical-chemical interactions occurring in Lake Ohrid. Similar mechanisms were postulated and evaluated in other hard water lake systems. In spite of the great depth of the lake (300 m+) and probable Pliocene age, these mechanisms are undoubtedly responsible for the low phytoplankton production occurring in the lake.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1977	53	1					49	54		10.1007/BF00021231	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00021231													WOS:A1977DB39800004

The importance of the structure of the detritivorous guild	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Although habitat size is known to influence both structural and functional properties of ecosystems, there have been few attempts to assess the influence of habitat size on ecosystem processes. Here we investigated the relationships between leaf litter decomposition and ecosystem surface area, macroinvertebrates and physico-chemical factors in five freshwater springs located in Huntingdon County (Pennsylvania, U.S.A.). Leaves of Ulmus americana L. were used to study leaf litter breakdown with the litter-bag technique. Field work was carried out at one sampling station per spring, each with eight replicates per sampling time (3, 20, 40 days), from April to May 2004. American elm leaves decomposed at different rates in the different springs, varying inversely with the spring area. The leaf bags were colonized by 16 taxa of benthic macrofauna, amongst which scrapers and shredders were the most common guild. Macroinvertebrate species richness co-varied with spring area, but not with other physico-chemical variables. Moreover, a significant inverse relationship was observed between American elm leaf decay rate and taxonomic richness. In the studied springs, habitat area was an ecosystem feature indirectly affecting detritus processing by influencing the structure of the detrital food web within the systems.

Correlation between occurrence of microalgal genera and some parameters of environment, physico-chemical nature of natural water bodies were explored by Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). Diversity indices have been calculated using PAST software program. A total of 23 microalgal taxa belonging to four algal classes were recorded and the study indicated that the microalgal diversity vary with variation in physico-chemical parameters of water and light intensity. Out of these genera, occurrence of Chodatella sp. in late summer and Tetrallantos sp. and Synechocystis sp. in winter season were specific. In CCA, multiple variables (dissolved oxygen, water temperature, electrical conductivity, pH, light intensity and inorganic phosphorous) played a significant role in occurrence of microalgal taxa. Observation concluded that the Chlorophycean members were dominant throughout the study period and the Shannon-Wiener diversity index was highest for a site with large number of Chlorophycean member. This study will help in future to assess water quality.

B	Alvarez-Cobelas, M		SanchezCarrillo, S; AlvarezCobelas, M		Alvarez-Cobelas, Miguel			Water physics	LIMNOLOGIA DE LA LAGUNA DE SOMOLINOS (GUADALAJARA): SINTESIS DEL CONOCIMIENTO CIENTIFICO	Biblioteca de Ciencias											a study on Laguna de Somolinos (Central Spain) physics has been carried out from June 2013 to June 2014, partly related with meteorological processes. UV-A rays reach some 2-3 m depths, depending upon the wavelength chosen. UV-B rays only enter 0.5-0.7 m. As expected, UV attenuation is inversely related with wavelength. Secchi transparency is 5.8 +/- 1.3 m, with chlorophyll-a explaining light attenuation statistically (R-2 = 0.79). PAR attenuation varied between 0.79 (October) and 0.17 m(-1) (February). The photic layer attains the whole water column most of the time. The temperature of upper mixed layers is 5.4 degrees C in January and 16.6 degrees C in June-July. Heavy inputs of groundwater and stream waters of groundwater origin, whose temperature is roughly similar throughout the year, are likely responsible for the low temperatures attained by lake water. The water column weakly stratifies from June to September, but this buoyancy can be rapidly destroyed by meteorological fronts. Anyway, re-establishment of thermal stratification is a usual process in this lake, once these fronts have passed. The lake stores heat from January to June, when it starts losing heat; 203 J/m2 are stored within these months, a figure which is representative of very small lakes. There is some heat flux below thermocline due to eddy diffusion, but it is not very frequent in space and time. Eddy diffusion rates amount 0.0018 +/- 0.0048 cm(2)/s, typical of small lakes. A statistically significant relationship between buoyancy frequency and eddy diffusivity has been found in this lake in summertime, and its regression coefficient (-1) implies that turbulence below thermocline might arise from cascading processes. Most heat budget processes experience a seasonal pattern. Evaporation and condensation are linked to wind regimes but radiative fluxes are always higher than those of other processes. The lake gains heat through Manadero stream inputs in Winter and Spring, and losses it by stream output throughout most of the year. Groundwater is also a source of heat exchange for the lake, which gains heat in Winter and Spring on account of this process. The daily heat balance is 32 +/- 79 W/m(2), ranging -254 and 317 W/m(2) with a lot of variability in the short term (weeks). In Laguna de Somolinos the water column is thermally homogenous as a rule (the mixing type of Somolinos water is 1, according to Spigel and Imberger (1980)). To short-time scales, the lake uses to gain heat at daytime and losses at night-time, but daily patterns change a great deal.																					978-84-00-10443-6; 978-84-00-10442-9				2018	46						69	95																WOS:000637015500006

We attempt to characterize the nature of these springs by estimating their chemical composition. While the springs around Lake Kinneret are subject to wide spatial and temporal variations in their ionic concentrations, specific sodium (Na), potassium, magnesium (Mg), strontium, bromine, and lithium to chlorine (Cl) ion ratios are almost constant within individual springs and spring groups. The radium:Cl ratio and the delta(18)O-Cl relationship confirm the notion that the spring waters result from recent mixing between saline brines and freshwater. Available compositional data from past years along with new analyses of the lake and its known springs allow identification of the salinity source that causes the observed deficit in the lake's salt budget (e.g., 91-93% chloride). The relative contributions from these saline springs are different for different ions; this contribution is highest for bromide (95%), decreases to 84% for Na, and is less than 50% for Mg. Two independent approaches have been used for balancing the salts in the lake, and they are as follows: (1) an annual mass balance between salt removal and supply of the different ions, assuming a steady-state lake; and (2) simulation of the lake's evolution from 1964 (the beginning of salt removal from the lake via the Salinity Diversion Channel) until the present. Both methods predict very similar ionic ratios for the (yet unknown) average saline spring(s), testifying to the reliability of both approaches. The ionic ratios so obtained closely resemble Fuliya (+/- Tabgha)-type waters, excluding the Tiberias and eastern shore springs as significant salt sources. This inferred composition of the average unmonitored springs depends strongly on present-day diversion of saline springs (this diversion thus prevents their flow into the lake). The different ionic ratios that identify the various spring groups reflect the respective compositions of the brine pockets that feed them. Our simulation also shows that the layered structure of Lake Kinneret enhanced the evolution rate of the lake after the implementation of the salt diversion program in 1964.																			0024-3590					JUN	1999	44	4					1035	1044		10.4319/lo.1999.44.4.1035	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1999.44.4.1035													WOS:000082148200006

An examination of rip current fatalities in the United States	NATURAL HAZARDS												This study analyzes fatalities caused by rip currents in the conterminous United States for the period 1994-2007. Results include the frequency of fatalities from rip currents, their cause, and their unique spatial distributions. An analysis of historical hazard event data illustrate that, on average, 35 people reportedly die from rip currents each year in the United States. Also, similar to other hazard events where unique differences in gender vulnerability have been found, men are over six times more likely to fall victim to a deadly rip current than females. Rip current fatalities are most common in the southeastern United States, with a nonuniform spatial distribution along other Atlantic, Pacific, and Great Lakes coastlines. Physical vulnerabilities are suggested as the primary cause for the unique fatality distribution found. Temporally, summer season weekends are shown to have the more fatalities than any other time of the year. A classification scheme was developed to categorize synoptic-scale weather conditions present during deadly rip current events. More than 70% of all rip current fatalities are associated with onshore winds. Specifically, a rip current fatality is most likely when a surface high pressure system creates these onshore winds. The quality of the fatality reporting database available for researchers is also assessed.

J	Andradóttir, HO; Nepf, HM				Andradóttir, HO; Nepf, HM			Thermal mediation in a natural littoral wetland:: Measurements and modeling	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												As a river flows through shallow littoral regions such as wetlands, forebays, and side arms, the temperature of the water is modified through atmospheric heat exchange. This process, which we call thermal mediation, can control the initial fate of river-borne nutrient and contaminant fluxes within a lake or reservoir. This paper presents temperature observations that demonstrate the occurrence of thermal mediation and directly support the theoretical results derived by Andradottir and Nepf [2000]. The measurements show that the wetland warms the river inflow by approximately 1-3 degrees C during summer and fall nonstorm conditions. Less thermal mediation occurs during storms, both because the residence time is significantly reduced and because the wetland circulation shifts from laterally well mixed (low flows) to short-circuiting (storms). The dead-zone model can simulate both these regimes and the transition between the regimes and is therefore a good choice for wetland modeling.					; Andradottir, Hrund/M-2013-2015	Andradottir, Hrund/0000-0002-4832-1503; 													0043-1397					OCT	2000	36	10					2937	2946		10.1029/2000WR900201	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2000WR900201													WOS:000089589600012

Natural pollutants of Northern Lake Baikal	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Hot and cold springs in the northwestern shore of Lake Baikal are investigated as natural pollutants of the lake, which can interfere with its chemistry. The study includes chemical analyses of lake water samples from different depths in the North Baikal basin, as well as waters of hot and cold onshore springs, and Baikal tributaries collected in 2007 through 2013. Thermal waters in the shore of Lake Baikal have much higher SO4, Cl, F, Na, and SiO2 concentrations than those in the lake water, as well as ten to hundred times greater enrichments in Li, Rb, Cs, Ga, As and W. Mineral water in cold springs is generally similar to the Baikal water with respect to total dissolved solids (TDS) and major-and trace-element chemistry. However, the Milky cold spring discovered in the lower reaches of the B. Cheremshan River within a few km from the lake stands out in its unusual Ca-Mg-SO4 composition, low pH (3.57) and high TDS (535 mg/l), and trace-element enrichments in Al, Mn, Ni, Co, Zn, Y, and REE. The concentrations of these elements are still higher, up to one or two orders of magnitude, in suspended solids abundant in the spring water. This water composition is typical rather of mine drainage in sulfide mineralization provinces and prompts the existence of a sulfide orebody in the area. Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, and Cd occur in the dissolved form, and their concentrations in stream water near the B. Cheremshan inlet into Baikal are only slightly lower than immediately downstream of the spring; REE and Y are ten times lower because of precipitation from the river water. However, all metals the spring water leaches from the surrounding rocks eventually end up in Lake Baikal. Although the spring has much greater enrichments relative to the Baikal water in a number of elements, it hardly can cause any significant change to the lake composition. Only local chemical anomalies of Mn, Al, Co, Ni, Zn, Cd, REE and Y can be expected in the bottom sediments where the lake uptakes the B. Cheremshan stream.

Recent studies have generated awareness of the high variability in pCO(2aq) (the partial pressure corresponding to the concentration in water) and CO2 fluxes to the atmosphere and the need for better accounting for this variability. However, studies simultaneously accounting for both spatial and temporal variability of pCO(2aq) and CO2 fluxes in lakes are rare. We measured pCO(2aq) (by both manual sampling and mini loggers) and CO2 fluxes, covering spatial variability in open water areas of three lakes of different character in a Swedish catchment for 2years. Spatial pCO(2aq) variability within lakes was linked to distance from shore, proximity to stream inlets, and deepwater upwelling events. Temporally, pCO(2aq) variability was linked with variability in dissolved organic carbon, total nitrogen, and dissolved oxygen. While previous studies over short time periods (1 to 6h) observed gas transfer velocity (k) to be more variable than pCO(2aq), our work shows that over longer time (days to weeks) pCO(2aq) variability was greater and affected CO2 fluxes much more than k. We demonstrate that 8 measurement days distributed over multiple seasons in combination with sufficient spatial coverage (8 locations during stratification periods and 5 or less in spring and autumn) are a key for representative yearly whole lake flux estimates. This study illustrates the importance of considering spatiotemporal variability in pCO(2aq) and CO2 fluxes to generate representative whole lake estimates.

A review of atmospheric and land surface processes with emphasis on flood generation in the Southern Himalayan rivers	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Floods in the southern rim of the Indian Himalayas are a major cause of loss of life, property, crops, infrastructure, etc. They have long term socio-economic impacts on the habitat living along/across the Himalayas. In the recent decade extreme precipitation events have led to numerous flash floods in and around the Himalayan region. Sporadic case-based studies have tried to explain the mechanisms causing the floods. However, in some of the cases, the causative mechanisms have been elusive. Various types of flood events have been debated at different spatial and temporal scales. The present study provides an overview of mechanisms that lead to floods in and around the southern rim of the Indian Himalayas.

Chlorophyll a Content in Bottom Sediments of the Shallow Busse Lagoon, Sakhalin Island	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE BIOLOGY												The present study provides the first results of measurements of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll degradation products in bottom sediments of the Busse Lagoon, Sakhalin Island, that were carried out at nearshore and central sites of different types in this body of water. The relationship between the sedimentary pigment content and the physicochemical characteristics of bottom sediments has been identified. As determined by the sedimentary phytopigment content the trophic level of the lagoon varies from oligo- to eutrophic in its different parts. The nearshore waters with an average content of chlorophyll a and pheopigments can be assigned to the oligotrophic category; the waters of the central part belong to the mesotrophic category. The concentration of chlorophyll with derivatives in sediments decreased from 21.4 +/- 5.6 mu g/g dry weight (d.w.) in the summer to 6.1 +/- 1.9 mu g/g d.w. in the autumn; for the entire lagoon, it averaged 16.3 +/- 4.4 mu g/g. The seasonal dynamics of sedimentary pigments does not correlate with that of phytoplankton and can depend to a greater extent on the hydrodynamic activity. With a relatively low sedimentary pigment content, the lagoon ecosystem shows signs of the terminal phase of the oligotrophic-eutrophic succession, that is, periodic mortality of aquatic organisms and silt accumulation.

Quantitative PCR reveals transient and persistent algal viruses in Lake Ontario, Canada	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												P>To determine if different algal viruses (Phycodnaviridae) share common patterns of seasonal abundance, quantitative PCR methods were developed and applied to monitor the abundances of three different viruses in Lake Ontario, Canada over 13 months. Throughout the year, the abundances of two different phycodnavirus polB gene fragments (LO1b-49 and LO1a-68) varied by more than two orders of magnitude, peaked during the autumn months, and were lowest during the summer. The seasonal abundance patterns of these two virus genes were similar and both were detected in almost every sample, but LO1b-49 was consistently an order of magnitude more abundant than LO1a-68. LO1b-49 reached a maximum abundance of 5413 +/- 312 genes ml-1, whereas LO1a-68's abundance peaked at only 881 +/- 113 genes ml-1. Another phycodnavirus polB fragment that was monitored (LO1b-16) was detected in only a few samples, but reached a higher maximum concentration (6771 +/- 879 genes ml-1) than either LO1b-49 or LO1a-68. The results of this year-long investigation of virus gene abundances suggests that Lake Ontario's phycodnavirus community is composed of persistent viruses detectable throughout the year and transient viruses present in only a few sporadic samples. The results also suggest that some persistent algal viruses are able to survive at relatively low abundances through several seasons.					; Short, Steven/F-5578-2011	Short, Steven/0000-0002-6576-4883; 													1462-2912	1462-2920				OCT	2009	11	10					2639	2648		10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.01988.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.01988.x								19558510					WOS:000270433700014

Predicted Chl-a were generally 2 to 6 times higher than measured concentrations. Measured phytoplankton biomass concentrations were also 1 to 6 times lower than those predicted from documented TP-biomass regression equations. There was an inconsistent relationship between biomass and Chl-a between years in our study; Chl-a was better correlated with the biomass of 8 flagellate species (mostly Cryptomonas) than with biomass of all algal taxa. Of the 48 phytoplankton taxa recorded, the biomass of 17 were statistically higher, and 4 were statistically lower in the fertilized basin when compared to a control basin. Enrichment did not change the species composition of the phytoplankton in the fertilized basin; all species that benefited from P- additions were already present in the basin prior to fertilization. The species that amassed the greatest increase in biomass was Tabellaria fenestrata. Other taxa that showed an increase were Cryptomonas, Chroomonas, Ochromonas, Chromulina and Peridinium. The biomass of Synedra, Tetraedron, Selenastrum and Pseudokephyrion were statistically lower in the fertilized basin than in the control.																			0003-9136					JUL	1987	110	1					67	82																WOS:A1987J539700005

Since then, a rather unstable draining system developed, including a western catchment with seasonal flow, a central one with mostly subterranean drainage in alluvial deposits, and a third one feeding Lake Konigssee. High numbers of small, typologically diverse groundwater-fed springs emerge year-round, mostly at elevations between 1000 and 1400 m a.s.l., but most headwater streams are unstable with seasonal flown and only in exceptional cases giving origin to higher-order streams. Intense studies on the springs of the area, organized by the National Park Berchtesgaden since 1994 in cooperation with numerous specialists, aim to: (1) assess distribution and geomorphology of the springs in the whole area; (2) document biological diversity at the most detailed possible taxonomic scale; and (3) develop and apply methods for the study of potential changes in spring biota in the frame of a network of long-term monitored habitats. Here we analyze some data resulting both from the first decade of research (see GERECKE & FRANZ 2006 for further details) and from 2005 field work, with the main goal to discuss the potential value of various parameters for long-term investigations.

Fish exhibit enormous biodiversity, inhabiting a variety of habitats and are important indicators of water quality. In present study, fish sampling was conducted from November 2007 to October 2008, using cast and drag nets. The fishes were identified following standard key. The data was statistically analyzed by one way ANOVA. A total of 22 fish species belonging to 10 families were recorded. The maximum fish species belonged to Cyprinidae (10) and minimum to Clupeidae (1). The cyprinids show higher relative abundance (72.27 % of total catch) compared to other fish families during the whole study period. Labeo rohita, Cirrhinus mrigala, Catla catla were the most abundant species with high frequency of occurrence. The relative abundance (%) of cyprinids was more in winter months compared to summer months. Highest species richness (as taxa numbers) was observed in December and lowest in September. There was no significant effect of season on fish abundance (P < 0.05). Diversity indices values indicate low fish biodiversity at this site.

Phenolic wastes from a coal carbonization factory on the major tributary also have enetered the lake in high but variable concentrations since 1974. During and after the summer of 1978-1979 total suspended solids and turbidity were high, the formerly dense macrophyte beds disappeared, the summer phytoplankton community changed from dominance by blue-green algae to diatoms, the eel fishery failed and the black swan population decreased to low levels. The once abundant lake resident form of the common smelt declined drastically between 1975 and 1981 and apparently was extinct by 1983. The migratory form, although abundant until 1981, was scarce by 1983. Low water levels in the outlet stream and the malfunction of a fish pass in the flood control structure located near its mouth may have impeded upstream migration in the spring of 1982. The major cause for the changes in Lake Waahi was the addition of silt; however, the loss of macrophytes may have caused increased toxicity of phenols, particularly to eels, and also promoted continual resuspension of sediments by more effective wind-produced circulation. Remedial measures are considered.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				FEB	1987	32	3-4					427	443																WOS:A1987G359600014

DMSP is believed to be a methionine metabolite produced by marine algae and higher plants as part of their osmoregulatory systems. Until now, this process was found exclusively in saline water and therefore was regarded as insignificant for the formation of DMS in freshwaters. It is hereby demonstrated that the process can be dominant in freshwater systems as well, and its product can even affect the odor quality of some drinking and recreational water systems. Peridinium gatunense, a freshwater dinoflagellate which dominates the phytoplankton population in the lake during the winter-spring season, stores a considerable amount (up to 5.5 pg/cell) of DMSP. P. gatunense growth curves reveal an increased storage of DMSP toward the stationary and declining growth phases. The DMSP undergoes bacterial and chemical degradation to release DMS. Released fluxes of DMS from the Lake of Galilee are estimated to be in the range of 0.1 mmol/m(2) month during the late period of the Peridinium bloom season.

Modern Eastern Canadian Arctic Lake Water Isotopes Exhibit Latitudinal Patterns in Inflow Seasonality and Minimal Evaporative Enrichment	PALEOCEANOGRAPHY AND PALEOCLIMATOLOGY												Lacustrine delta H-2 and delta O-18 isotope proxies are powerful tools for reconstructing past climate and precipitation changes in the Arctic. However, robust paleoclimate record interpretations depend on site-specific lake water isotope systematics, which are poorly described in the eastern Canadian Arctic due to insufficient modern lake water isotope data. We use modern lake water isotopes (delta O-18 and delta H-2) collected between 1994-1997 and 2017-2021 from a transect of sites spanning a Quebec-to-Ellesmere Island gradient to evaluate the effects of inflow seasonality and evaporative enrichment on the delta H-2 and delta O-18 composition of lake water. Four lakes near Iqaluit, Nunavut sampled biweekly through three ice-free seasons reflect mean annual precipitation isotopes with slight evaporative enrichment. In a 23 degrees latitudinal transect of 181 lakes, through-flowing lake water delta H-2 and delta O-18 fall along local meteoric water lines. Despite variability within each region, we observe a latitudinal pattern: southern lakes reflect mean annual precipitation isotopes, whereas northern lakes reflect summer-biased precipitation isotopes. This pattern suggests that northern lakes are more fully flushed with summer precipitation, and we hypothesize that this occurs because the ratio of runoff to precipitation increases with latitude as vegetation cover decreases. Therefore, proxy records from through-flowing lakes in this region should reflect precipitation isotopes with minimal influence of evaporation, but vegetation changes in lake catchments across a latitudinal transect and through geologic time may influence the seasonality of lake water isotopic compositions. Thus, we recommend that future lake water isotope proxy records are considered in context with temperature and ecological proxy records.

J	RINEHART, RB; MCFARLANE, DA				RINEHART, RB; MCFARLANE, DA			EARLY HOLOCENE VEGETATION RECORD FROM THE SALTON BASIN, CALIFORNIA	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Plant and vertebrate macrofossils in an early Holocene fossil packrat (Neotoma sp.) midden with a radiocarbon age of 8640 +/- 100 C-14 yr B.P. are reported from the Chocolate Mountains, near the Salton Sea, Riverside County, California. An inventory of the midden has permitted a comparison of the modern flora and fauna of the site with that extant during the early Holocene. Whereas the biota had assumed most aspects of its modern Sonoran desert aspect by this date, statistically significant evidence of differences is attributed to an increased flow of surface water in Salt Creek, a high-standing, low-salinity Lake LeConte, and the late arrival of some characteristic Sonoran desert plants. These observations are consistent with models of significant fall-winter precipitation in the Sonoran Desert, although we cannot exclude alternative explanations.

Large Seasonal and Habitat Differences in Methane Ebullition on the Amazon Floodplain	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Tropical floodplains are an important source of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere, and ebullitive fluxes are likely to be important. We report direct measurements of CH4 ebullition in common habitats on the Amazon floodplain over two years based on floating chambers that allowed detection of bubbles, and submerged bubble traps. Ebullition was highly variable in space and time. Of the 840 floating chamber measurements (equivalent to 8,690 min of 10-min deployments), 22% captured bubbles. Ebullitive CH4 fluxes, measured using bubble traps deployed for a total of approximately 230 days, ranged from 0 to 109 mmol CH4 m(-2) d(-1), with a mean of 4.4 mmol CH4 m(-2) d(-1). During falling water, a hydroacoustic echosounder detected bubbles in 24% of the 70-m segments over 34 km. Ebullitive flux increased as the water level fell faster during falling water periods. In flooded forests, highest ebullitive fluxes occurred during falling water, while in open water and herbaceous plant habitats, higher ebullitive fluxes were measured during low water periods. The contribution of diffusive plus ebullitive CH4 flux represented by ebullition varied from 1% (high and rising water in open water of the lake) to 93% (falling water in flooded forests) based on bubble traps. Combining ebullitive and diffusive fluxes among habitats in relation to variations in water depth and areal coverage of aquatic habitats provides the basis for improved floodplain-wide estimates of CH4 evasion.					; Amaral, João Henrique/AAC-4315-2022; Barbosa, Pedro/KPA-6836-2024; forsberg, bruce/AAE-4092-2020; Linkhorst, Annika/AAR-6013-2020	Amaral, Joao Henrique/0000-0002-8992-6082; Linkhorst, Annika/0000-0002-3609-5107													2169-8953	2169-8961				JUL	2021	126	7							e2020JG005911	10.1029/2020JG005911	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JG005911													WOS:000677821700017

The rarity of Medieval sites, systematic excavations and multi-disciplinary work in the subcontinent obscure the impact of two distinct climate anomalies - the 'Medieval Warm Period' ('MWP', 740 - 1150 CE), followed by the 'Little Ice Age' ('LIA', 1350 - 1850 CE). The finds from the archaeological site indicate the presence of winter and summer crops, suggesting the region was likely warm and mild humid during pre-Medieval period (ca. 600 - 800 CE). During Medieval times (between ca. 800 - 1300 CE), a diversification of the crop assemblage suggests that the region was under a warm and humid climate, corresponding to the 'MWP', driving increased monsoon precipitation. During the post-Medieval period (ca. 1350 - 1800 CE), drought-resistant millets and other summer pulse crops indicate the region probably experienced weak SW monsoon precipitation coinciding with globally recognised 'LIA'. These interpretations are supported through phytolith data from the archaeological deposit broadly indicating two phases, the first being a period of diversified agricultural/anthropogenic activity (ca. 600 - 1350 CE), followed by a period dominated by drought-resistant crops (ca. 1350 - 1800 CE). Pollen data from a proximal lake corroborate the warm and humid phase ca. 800 - 1400 CE, with strong representation of warm-humid favouring tropical forest taxa, followed by non-arboreal indicators of a drier more open landscape ca. 1500 - 1800 CE. These environmental changes may have combined with other historic and institutional factors that led to the ultimate abandonment of the city. These changing cropping patterns, vegetation and cultural developments provide insight into past human response to climate change as well as important lessons for modern societies in exploring sustainable agricultural strategies to future climate change.

Multi-century tree-ring anatomical evidence reveals increasing frequency and magnitude of spring discharge and floods in eastern boreal Canada	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												In eastern boreal Canada, variability in river discharge is poorly understood at the multi-century scale due to short instrumental records. In recent decades, increased magnitude and frequency of spring floods have raised concerns about the potential effects of climate change on flood risk. Unlike tree-ring width, flood rings have a demonstrated dendrochronological utility for reconstructing high discharge in boreal environments. In this study, twelve chronologies of earlywood vessel cross-sectional area (a new hydrological proxy) and ring width were developed from riparian Fraxinus nigra trees periodically flooded in spring. These chronologies were used as predictors of Harricana River spring discharge, which was reconstructed for the period 1771?2016. The reconstruction captured 69% of the variance over a 102-year calibration period. The reconstruction indicates that the magnitude and frequency of spring high discharge has increased since the end of the Little Ice Age (1850?1870 CE) and since 1950. The change from a multi-decadal frequency in the late 19th century to a decadal and then interannual frequency in the late 20th century is associated with an increase in snow cover over much of central-eastern Canada. The association between the reconstructed spring discharge and spring atmospheric circulation indices NINO3.4, AMO, NAO may also have changed in these periods and further work is needed to assess the stability of these associations. The correlation between reconstructed and instrumental spring discharge at the regional scale, as well as the shared features in reconstructed discharge and other paleorecords from subarctic Que?bec suggest a common hydrological signal across the study area and for the early 20th to 21st centuries. The unprecedently low and high spring discharge in recent decades compared to the historical natural variability of the last 250 years also suggests that the increase in flood frequency and magnitude originates from climate change.					; NOLIN, Alexandre/AID-1797-2022	NOLIN, Alexandre Florent/0000-0003-1033-9123; 													0921-8181	1872-6364				APR	2021	199								103444	10.1016/j.gloplacha.2021.103444	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2021.103444		FEB 2021											WOS:000632982700001
J	Janse, JH; Van Donk, E; Aldenberg, T				Janse, JH; Van Donk, E; Aldenberg, T			A model study on the stability of the macrophyte-dominated state as affected by biological factors	WATER RESEARCH												The transition of shallow lake ecosystems between the clear-water, macrophyte-dominated state and the turbid state dominated by phytoplankton depends on both physico-chemical and biological factors. In this study, the impact of some of these interactions on the stability of the macrophyte-dominated state of a lake are studied by means of the integrated eutrophication model PCLake. The model describes phytoplankton, macrophytes and a simplified food web, within the framework of closed nutrient cycles. The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of herbivory by birds and fish on the transition from clear to turbid state, including the influence of variability in other biological parameters. The model was applied to the data of a small, biomanipulated lake, dominated by macrophytes, showing signs of a transition back to the turbid state. Simulations were carried out for the lake as well as for an experimental situation where herbivory was impeded. A parameter variation study was performed for 10 parameters, affecting the zooplankton, fish and macrophytes behaviour, to determine the sensitivities and the model uncertainty. The model reproduced adequately the transition of the lake from phytoplankton dominance before the biomanipulation, via dominance of rooted perennial plants in the first years after it, to a state characterized by turion-forming plants in early summer and phytoplankton in autumn. It is shown that the probability of the transition back to phytoplankton dominance is mainly enhanced by herbivory by birds. This caused a shift towards inedible plant species with a shorter natural growing season, allowing the return of a phytoplankton bloom in autumn. If herbivory was impeded, this shift did not occur and phytoplankton remained low due to nitrogen limitation. The model results were quite sensitive to the zooplankton filtering rate and, in the presence of herbivory only, to the macrophytes growth parameters. The impact of the fish parameters showed to be less important. The model may be used to evaluate the relative importance of different assumptions or factors in the success of biomanipulation measures in lakes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Hélie, JF; Hillaire-Marcel, C				Hélie, Jean-François; Hillaire-Marcel, Claude			Sources of particulate and dissolved organic carbon in the St Lawrence River:: isotopic approach	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												We investigate sources of both dissolved and particulate organic carbon in the St Lawrence River from its source (the Great Lakes outlet) to its estuary, as well as in two of its tributaries. Special attention is given to seasonal interannual patterns by using data collected on a bi-monthly basis from mid-1998 to mid-2003. delta C-13 measurements in dissolved inorganic carbon, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC), as well as molar C:N in particulate organic matter (POM), are used to bring insight into the dynamic between aquatic versus terrigenous sources. In addition, C-14 activities of DOC were measured at the outlet of the St Lawrence River to its estuary to assess a mean age of the DOC exported to the estuary. In the St Lawrence River itself, aquatically produced POC dominates terrestrially derived POC and is depleted in C-13 by approximately 12 parts per thousand versus dissolved CO2. In the Ottawa River, the St Lawrence River's most important tributary, the present dataset did not allow for convincing deciphering of POC sources. In a small tributary of the St Lawrence River, aquatically produced POC dominates in summer and terrestrially derived POC dominates in winter. DOC seems to be dominated by terrestrially derived organic matter at all sampling sites, with some influence of DOC derived from aquatically produced POC in summer in the St Lawrence River at the outlet of the Great Lakes and in one of its small tributaries. The overall bulk DOC is relatively recent (C-14 generally exceeding 100% modem carbon) in the St Lawrence River at its outlet to the estuary, suggesting that it derives mainly from recent organic matter from topsoils in the watershed.

By knowing the metal concentrations in different depths it is possible to divide these metals into three groups. While the concentrations of iron, manganese, and zinc decline with decreasing depth, those of aluminium, copper, and nickel rise up. For lead and cobalt no distinct tendency could be determined. The limit value for all measured elements was not exceeded in any sampling location. The binding character of the metals is, besides the seasonal conditions of the lake (circulation in spring and stagnation in summer), influenced by the sediment depth. The addition of Carbokalk(R) for lake water neutralization had no significant effect on binding character of the analyzed metals. The application of a sequential extraction procedure enabled a classification of the available metal binding forms. All analyzed metals Occurred mainly in compounds which are difficult to mobilize and for environment only slightly available.					; von Tümpling, Wolf/H-9032-2013	von Tumpling, Wolf/0000-0003-1815-4764; 													0323-4320					MAY	2004	32	1					7	15		10.1002/aheh.200200514	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aheh.200200514													WOS:000221996100001

Differences in DDE levels occurred between several sex and age classes during Dec. on Lake Michigan; these differences were not apparent in the spring. Increases in DDE and PCB residues for oldsquaws occurred on Lake Michigan between Dec. and May. DDE residues in the wing and carcass were significantly correlated. Residues were relatively low in oldsquaw foods from Lake Michigan; concentration factors between the food and the ducks varied between 1 .times. 22 .times., depending on the date and compound. Organochlorinated residues were lower in Arctic than in Lake Michigan food samples. DDE in paired male and female oldsquaws was highly correlated, as was DDE in females and clutches. Eggshell thickness had declined 4.5% compared with eggs collected before 1947. Residues were highest in oldsquaws wintering on the Great Lakes and lowest in oldsquaws from coastal areas.																			0031-6156						1978	11	4					170	181											97621					WOS:A1978FK94200003

A few hundred meters downstream of the source zone, during the summer dry periods, there are losses of water in the riverbed resulting in its total drying. The sinking zone in that area is built of high permeable carbonate rocks and with the appearance of less permeable dolomite rocks, about 17 km downstream, the Korana River becomes a permanent river. This paper focuses on the explanation of hydrogeological relations in the zone where losses of water occur in the riverbed, relationship to the neighbouring Una River catchment, as well as possibilities of relocating the source of water supply from the Kozjak Lake (Plitvice Lakes) to the new site in the sinking zone of the Korana River. For this purpose hydrogeological researches were performed, with drilling of several piezometric boreholes and two tracing tests to determine the direction of groundwater flow during the dry season. The results show that during the dry periods in the sinking zone of the Korana River the groundwater level with active aquifer is about 25 m below the riverbed. This opens up the possibility of additional research to solve the problem of water-supply and relocation of water-supply capture in this area. Two tracing tests showed a connection with the Klokot spring (Bosnia and Herzegovina) in the neighbouring Una River catchment, which points to the transboundary character of this aquifer. At the source of the Klokot minimum discharge is around 3 m(3)/s and the maximum more than 75 m(3)/s. The capturing of about 60 l/s for water-supply in the Korana River sinking zone will not have impact on the amount of discharge at the Klokot spring.

It is used for hydropower generation, fishing, crop irrigation, and tourist activities. In this chapter, we assess the evolution of its physico-chemical and ecological status and compare it with the results of previous studies. The lake, which is considered as monomictic, stratifies in spring and summer providing different physico-chemical compositions at different depths. The trophic state of the lake has not witnessed any improvements in the last 10 years. Its phytoplankton community has low biodiversity and is dominated by toxic cyanobacterial blooms Microcystis aeruginosa and Aphanizomenon ovalisporum. Due to these toxic blooms, using its water for swimming and drinking should be avoided under the present conditions. For safe use of its water, an effective management at the level of its watershed is highly recommended to improve water quality.					fadel, ali/AAF-7950-2019														0921-092X	1872-4663	978-3-319-76300-2; 978-3-319-76299-9				2018	85						71	86		10.1007/978-3-319-76300-2_5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-76300-2_5	10.1007/978-3-319-76300-2												WOS:000479146600008

We followed spatiotemporal dynamics of the nitrifying microbial community in deep oligotrophic Lake Constance. Depth-dependent decrease of total ammonium (0.01-0.84 mu M) indicated the hypolimnion as the major place of nitrification with N-15-isotope dilution measurements indicating a threefold daily turnover of hypolimnetic total ammonium. This was mirrored by a strong increase of ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaeota towards the hypolimnion (13%-21% of bacterioplankton) throughout spring to autumn as revealed by amplicon sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria were typically two orders of magnitude less abundant and completely ammonia-oxidizing (comammox) bacteria were not detected. Both, 16S rRNA gene and amoA (encoding ammonia monooxygenase subunit B) analyses identified only one major species-level operational taxonomic unit (OTU) of Thaumarchaeota (99% of all ammonia oxidizers in the hypolimnion), which was affiliated to Nitrosopumilus spp. The relative abundance distribution of the single Thaumarchaeon strongly correlated to an equally abundant Chloroflexi clade CL500-11 OTU and a Nitrospira OTU that was one order of magnitude less abundant. The latter dominated among recognized nitrite oxidizers. This extremely low diversity of nitrifiers shows how vulnerable the ecosystem process of nitrification may be in Lake Constance as Central Europe's third largest lake.					; Straile, Dietmar/A-4065-2008; Pester, Michael/A-3870-2013; Dannenmann, Michael/A-7278-2013; Sikorski, Johannes/AAD-9775-2019	Klotz, Franziska/0000-0002-0240-7934; Straile, Dietmar/0000-0002-7441-8552; Pester, Michael/0000-0001-6296-4145; Dannenmann, Michael/0000-0001-5924-7612; Sikorski, Johannes/0000-0002-1890-5540; 													1462-2912	1462-2920				JAN	2020	22	1					212	228		10.1111/1462-2920.14840	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.14840		NOV 2019						31657089					WOS:000495883300001

With fish held under seasonally appropriate light-dark cycles with twilight (LD + t), the onset of diurnal activity occurred during dawn and its timing (.psi.onset) followed a bimodal annual pattern that was correlated with seasonal changes in the duration and physical characteristics of twilight. The end of activity occurred during dusk (.psi.offset) and followed a unimodal annual pattern that was determined by day length. Under LD + t, .alpha. followed a sigmoidal annual pattern. The circadian period underwent significant seasonal changes with maximum and minimum .tau. values occurring during summer and winter, respectively. Fish that were entrained to rectangular light-dark cycles that excluded twilights (LD) failed to show any seasonal changes in .psi. and .tau. and the sigmoidal relation between .alpha. and day length was absent.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1981	59	7					1326	1334		10.1139/z81-184	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z81-184													WOS:A1981MA32500014

Phytoplankton of the Chaco-Pampean Plain	FRESHWATER PHYTOPLANKTON OF ARGENTINA: PHYTOPLANKTON DIVERSITY AND ECOLOGY IN DIFFERENT AQUATIC SYSTEMS	Advances in Limnology											This article summarizes the characteristics of phytoplankton of the Chaco-Pampean Plain between the Pilcomayo River (25 degrees 15'S; 57 degrees 45'W) and the Lower Salado River (31 degrees 39'S; 60 degrees 45'W) towards the Paraguay-Parana system. This subtropical area has a climate gradient from east (wet) to west (arid). Rivers and streams have a seasonal regime, with floods in autumn and dry periods at the end of winter. These hydrological fluctuations appear to be the driving forces of the phytoplankton community. During low waters (flow reduction and increase in salinity), diversity is reduced and density of euryhaline species is increased. The highest algal development in this area was observed during the extraordinary low water period of La Nina. In occasions of environmental stability and high temperatures, water blooms of Anabaenopsis arnoldii, A. nadsonii and Nodularia harveyana have been recorded. The lenitic environments of the western region (arid) show marked fluctuations in extension and depth and may dry during periods of scarce precipitations. Phytoplankton density is low and represented by small Chlorococcales and Euglenophyceae. Water blooms of Dolichospermum spp. and Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii are frequent. Shallow lakes and wetlands of the eastern region (wet), which have presence of macrophytes and high organic matter, are dominated by Cryptophyceae, Chlorococcales and a wide variety of species of Euglenophyceae and diatoms. The Ramsar Site called 'Humedales Chaco' has the greatest diversity of species in this region.					; Devercelli, Melina/AAK-4647-2021	Devercelli, Melina/0000-0002-0464-2997; 													1612-166X		978-3-510-47067-9				2014	65						81	98		10.1127/1612-166X/2014/0065-0035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1612-166X/2014/0065-0035													WOS:000339640200007

Using mechanistic insights to predict the climate-induced expansion of a key aquatic predator	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Ameliorating the impacts of climate change on communities requires understanding the mechanisms of change and applying them to predict future responses. One way to prioritize efforts is to identify biotic multipliers, which are species that are sensitive to climate change and disproportionately alter communities. We first evaluate the mechanisms underlying the occupancy dynamics of marbled salamanders, a key predator in temporary ponds in the eastern United States We use long-term data to evaluate four mechanistic hypotheses proposed to explain occupancy patterns, including autumn flooding, overwintering predation, freezing, and winterkill from oxygen depletion. Results suggest that winterkill and fall flooding best explain marbled salamander occupancy patterns. A field introduction experiment supports the importance of winterkill via hypoxia rather than freezing in determining overwinter survival and rejects dispersal limitation as a mechanism preventing establishment. We build climate-based correlative models that describe salamander occupancy across ponds and years at two latitudinally divergent sites, a southern and middle site, with and without field-collected habitat characteristics. Correlative models with climate and habitat variation described occupancy patterns better than climate-only models for each site, but poorly predicted occupancy patterns at the site not used for model development. We next built hybrid mechanistic metapopulation occupancy models that incorporated flooding and winterkill mechanisms. Although hybrid models did not describe observed site-specific occupancy dynamics better than correlative models, they better predicted the other site's dynamics, revealing a performance trade-off between model types. Under future climate scenarios, models predict an increased occupancy of marbled salamanders, especially at the middle site, and expansion at a northern site beyond the northern range boundary. Evidence for the climate sensitivity of marbled salamanders combined with their disproportionate ecological impacts suggests that they might act as biotic multipliers of climate change in temporary ponds. More generally, we predict that top aquatic vertebrate predators will expand into temperate-boreal lakes as climate change reduces winterkill worldwide. Predaceous species with life histories sensitive to winter temperatures provide good candidates for identifying additional biotic multipliers. Building models that include biological mechanisms for key species such as biotic multipliers could better predict broad changes in communities and design effective conservation actions.					; Nadeau, Christopher/AAN-6201-2020; Urban, Mark/Y-2430-2019	Giery, Sean/0000-0003-3774-5295; Nadeau, Christopher/0000-0002-3568-0793													0012-9615	1557-7015				AUG	2023	93	3								10.1002/ecm.1575	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecm.1575		MAY 2023											WOS:000989457300001
J	Laybourn-Parry, J; Marshall, WA; Marchant, HJ				Laybourn-Parry, J; Marshall, WA; Marchant, HJ			Flagellate nutritional versatility as a key to survival in two contrasting Antarctic saline lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Seasonal patterns of grazing and photosynthesis were investigated in two saline Antarctic lakes (Highway and Ace) in the Vestfold Hills (68 degrees S). The phototrophic nanoflagellate (PNAN) community was dominated by Pyramimonas gelidicola and two morphological forms of a cryptophyte species that occurred throughout the year. Both species were mixotrophic on bacteria, and in Highway Lake they also exploited dissolved organic carbon as determined by the uptake of fluorescently labelled dextrans. 2. Clearance rates ranged between 0.02 and 0.21 nL h(-1) cell(-1) in Ace Lake and 0.004-1.05 nL h(-1) cell(-1) in Highway Lake. On occasion cryptophyte grazing equalled that of the heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNAN). 3. Photosynthetic rates showed similar trends in both lakes, but there were differences in chlorophyll a specific rates and photosynthetic efficiency, probably related to the meromictic characteristic of Ace Lake. Primary production was measurable in winter and peaked in summer following the maxima of mixotroph grazing. 4. The HNAN community of Highway Lake achieved clearance rates of 0.02-1.80 nL h(-1) cell(-1) and removing between 50 and 693 ng bacterial carbon L-1 day(-1), with highest impact in winter when HNAN were most abundant. The HNAN also ingested fluorescently labelled dextrans showing a preference for 4 and 500 kDa molecules. The more diverse HNAN community of Ace Lake had lower clearance rates (0.04-0.37 nL h(-1) cell(-1)) and exerted a lower grazing pressure on bacterioplankton. In Highway Lake, where the HNAN community was dominated by the choanoflagellate Diaphanoeca grandis, there was a significant correlation between mean cell volume and clearance rate. 5. The major feature was that the microbial plankton functioned throughout the year by employing nutritional versatility.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				MAY	2005	50	5					830	838		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01369.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01369.x													WOS:000228690300008

In most yrs. the max. density of Asterionella was reached when the silica concn. fell to approx. 0.5 mg. per l.; a catastrophic drop in nos. usually follows. No large diatom populations were produced at concns. of silica below 0.5 mg. per 1.

Acoustic telemetry as a potential tool for mixed-stock analysis of fishery harvest: a feasibility study using Lake Erie walleye	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Understanding stock composition is critical for sustainable management of mixed-stock fisheries. When natural markers routinely used for stock discrimination fail, alternative techniques are required. We investigated the feasibility of using acoustic telemetry to estimate spawning population contributions to a mixed-stock fishery using Lake Erie's summer walleye (Sander vitreus) recreational fishery as a case study. Postrelease survival was estimated after tagging and used to inform simulations to evaluate how contribution estimates could be affected by survival, sample size, and expected population contributions. Walleye experienced low short-term survival after tagging, but showed higher survival after 100 days, likely allowing fish to return to spawning areas the following spring. Based on simulations, accuracy and precision of population composition increased with an increase in the number of tagged fish released, and both appeared to stabilize when >= 200 tagged fish were released. Results supported the feasibility of using acoustic telemetry to estimate spawning population contributions to mixed-stock fisheries in Lake Erie.

D.; Dwyer, Greg			Demographic stochasticity, environmental variability, and windows of invasion risk for Bythotrephes longimanus in North America	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Biological invasions are a leading threat to freshwater biodiversity worldwide. A central unanswered question of invasion ecology is why some introduced populations establish while most fail. Answering this question will allow resource managers to increase the specificity and effectiveness of control efforts and policy. We studied the establishment of spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus) in the United States and Canada by modeling introduction failure caused by demographic stochasticity, environmental variation, and seasonal environmental forcing. We compared predicted establishment rates with observed invasions of inland lakes in Ontario, Canada. Our findings suggest that environmental forcing can cause "windows" of invasion opportunity so that timing of introductions might be a greater determinant of population establishment than demographic stochasticity and random environmental variation. We expect this phenomenon to be exhibited by species representing a wide range of life histories. For spiny water flea in North America, a large window of invasion opportunity opens around the fourth week of May, persists through the summer, and closes with decreasing water temperatures in autumn. These results show how timing of introductions with respect to seasonally forced environmental drivers can be a key determinant of establishment success. By focusing on introductions during windows of invasion opportunity, resource managers can more effectively control invasion rates.

Seasonal variation of polychlorinated biphenyl congeners in surficial sediment, trapped settling material, and suspended particulate material in Lake Michigan, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												A unique time series of surface sediment, trapped settling material, and suspended particulate material polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) samples were collected at a 45-m deep site off Grand Haven (MI, USA) over a 14-month period. Both concentrations and congener distributions remained constant for the sediments, although there were seasonal and interannual variability in the other matrices. Trapped settling material and suspended particulate material PCB concentrations were substantially lower (similar to 50%) in 1997 than in the samples front December 1997 through July, 1998. The cause could not be determined from the data collected, but there were some very large storms during the winter-spring period of 1998, resulting in major sediment resuspension throughout the southern basin. Observed seasonal variation in PCB concentration and congener distribution on particles likely was due to the changes in particle composition. These include particle size and the source of particles (such as the amount of resuspended sediment in trapped settling material), and the role of diagenesis of the organic matter on particles.																			0730-7268	1552-8618				FEB	2008	27	2					313	322		10.1897/07-006R.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1897/07-006R.1								18348618					WOS:000252500000010

This data set suggests that urban PAH concentrations are trending downward in the U.K. Sigma PCB concentrations (Sigma = congeners 28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153, and 180) were usually similar to 0.2-2 ng m(-3) over the study period, with concentrations of the seven PCB congeners (Sigma PCB) in London generally 2-3 times higher than in Manchester. PCB concentrations have remained quite stable year-on-year over the study period. PCDD/F trends at the two sites were similar, with a decline through 1991-1994, followed by an upturn in 1995. Summer:winter seasonality of PCDD/Fs at both sites has been highly erratic year-on-year and compound-by-compound, far more so than for PAHs and PCBs. This is perhaps best interpreted as a sign that various sources (presumably combustion-derived) have contributed different mixtures of PCDD/Fs of different source strengths at different times to the air at these urban sites. Possible causes are discussed.

J	CENTER, TD; SPENCER, NR				CENTER, TD; SPENCER, NR			THE PHENOLOGY AND GROWTH OF WATER HYACINTH (EICHHORNIA-CRASSIPES (MART) SOLMS) IN A EUTROPHIC NORTH-CENTRAL FLORIDA LAKE	AQUATIC BOTANY												A population of water hyacinth in north-central Florida was monitored at weekly intervals to determine annual changes in maximum leaf length, lamina and petiole area, lamina area index, number of leaves per plant, plant density, leaf density, biomass distribution, root/shoot ratio and standing crop. Three distinct phases were apparent in the annual re-development of the population. The first was characterized by a reapportion of the biomass distribution following winter freeze damage to the emergent shoot. The 2nd phase began in early spring and was characterized by increased branching and ramet production, high leaf densities and high foliar height diversity. The third phase began in late spring and was characterized by increases in leaf size, a stable number of leaves per rosette, a loss of the smaller plants resulting in a lower absolute density, and maximal standing crop values. The lamina area index began to increase during the 1st phase and continued through the 3rd phase. All 3 phases are interpreted as mechanisms enabling an increase in the leaf area index (increases in leaves per plant, leaf density and leaf size, respectively) which closely paralleled solar radiation intensities. The maximum rate of biomass accumulation was estimated to be approximately 20 g m-2 day-1, and the maximum relative growth rate was approximately 1.50% day-1. Peak efficiency of tissue storage relative to solar input was estimated to be approximately 1.4%. The period of maximum growth occurred in April before the attainment of the peak standing crop (approximately 2.3-2.5 kg m-2). Growth apparently is a function of an interaction between the lamina area ratio (lamina area index:standing crop) and solar radiation. Plant density was inversely related to plant size and apparently was a function of the degree of intraspecific competition for light and space. Peak densities as high as 180 plants m-2 occurred in April but this was reduced to stable values of 70-80 during the summer. Root, stem and leaf ratios were very constant during the frost-free period of the year. Following the attainment of the ceiling yield in June, a gradual decline began during which standing crop values appeared to track climatic conditions in a steady-state situation. As the standing crop declined, so did the average height of the canopy, and the population responded through an increase in plant density. The response of water hyacinth to various environmental conditions through changes in plant proportions, leaf size and form, sexual or vegetative reproduction, etc. is probably the result of its adaptation to tropical riverine systems in which the plant is likely to encounter frequent expansions or contractions of the available habitat with alternating wet and dry seasons. These adaptations permit the plant to persist upstream following flooding, rapidly recolonize areas after being washed out and to establish new populations if swept downstream. This ability to rapidly re-establish populations following extreme perturbations makes permanent control of this weed difficult in its adventive range.																			0304-3770	1879-1522					1981	10	1					1	32		10.1016/0304-3770(81)90002-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(81)90002-4													WOS:A1981LG51700001

However, attribution of the warming rate in a shallow lake is not well understood yet. Here, we evaluated a one-dimensional lake model FLake by observed daily lake surface water temperature (LSWT) at four typical lakes in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River basin and then attributed LSWT warming to climate variables during the period 1979-2017. We found that FLake could capture well the seasonal/interannual variation of observed LSWT. During the 39-year study period, LSWT significantly warms at a rate of 0.26-0.28 degrees C per decade, 24-35% slower than the air temperature. Increased solar radiation and air temperature contributed to most (>80%) of the LSWT warming. The warming trend of LSWT in the spring is the largest among the four seasons, 2-4 times the warming rate of the other seasons.

Spawning shortnose ciscoes have been collected from Lake Huron and Georgian Bay of Lake Huron since 1956, however, no individuals have been collected from these habitats since 1985. Shortnose ciscoes were not collected during surveys of the cisco fishery of Georgian Bay during the summer of 1992 and spring of 1993. The lack of captures in the last eight years coupled with captures of only lone individuals in the last 16 years suggests the species may be extinct in all of the Laurentian system. The life history traits examined for Lake Huron shortnose ciscoes were similar to the conditions recorded for Lakes Michigan and Ontario shortnose ciscoes, although Lake Huron fish were smaller.																			0071-1128		3-510-47047-8				1995	46						71	77																WOS:A1995BH14P00008

I gathered and compared data on seasonal activity patterns of two populations in southern peninsular Florida, around Lake Okeechobee and southern Dade Comity. Snakes from both populations exhibited two activity peaks, one in spring and one in fall. The highest frequency of encounters was in March and April daring the peak of the breeding season. During this time males were encountered more often than females, possibly because they are actively searching for mates. Encounter rates arc constrained by temperature rather than precipitation. The majority of snakes were found ill the open aboveground between 24 C to 29 C, with the highest frequency at 27 C. At lower and higher temperatures encounter rates decreased as snakes may retreat into refugia. Adults were encountered more often than juveniles. Adults are primarily diurnal, whereas juveniles exhibit crepuscular and nocturnal behaviors. An apparent ontogenetic shift in diel activity occurred at approximately 90 cm SVL, where secretive,juveniles gradually become more diurnal.																			0003-0031					JUL	2002	148	1					102	114		10.1674/0003-0031(2002)148[0102:SAOTFK]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1674/0003-0031(2002)148[0102:SAOTFK]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000176839400009

Mammals were the major prey in 499 scats that were analysed. Rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) were the staple prey, while carrion was an important secondary food. Invertebrates, other mammalian prey, vegetation, birds and reptiles were generally minor components of the diet. Few significant seasonal differences in diet were found; however, invertebrates contributed less and possums more to the diet in winter and summer respectively. A significant dietary response was found to changes in rabbit abundance, but not for the other prey types. Cats continued to prey heavily on rabbits even after a 90% decline in rabbit abundance occurred, which coincided with the advent of Rabbit Calicivirus Disease (RCD). House mice (Mus domesticus) increased in importance in the diet ten months post-RCD. Although the abundance of cats was correlated with the abundance of some prey species, other factors may have influenced the observed patterns; these are discussed.

However, the compositional variation and these factors' effects on fluorescence DOM (FDOM) in urban rivers undergoing different anthropogenic pressure are poorly investigated. Herein, using fluorescence excitation-emission matrix and parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC), four FDOM components (C1, C2, C3, and C4) were identified in a less urbanized north river (NR) and a more urbanized west river (WR) of Jiulong River Watershed in Fujian province, China. C1, C2, and C4 were related to humic-like substances (HLS) and C3 to protein-like substances (PLS). HLS (63.9% in WR and 36.4% in NR) and PLS (62.7% in WR and 37.3% in NR) exhibited higher fluorescence in the more urbanized river. We also found higher PLS in winter, but higher HLS in summer for both rivers. Although the coefficient of variation indicated a difference in FDOM components sta-bility to some extent between the two rivers, the typhoon event that occurred in summer had a stronger disruptive impact on the CDOM and FDOM of a more urbanized river than that of a less urbanized river. We explore abiotic and biotic factors' effects on FDOM using the partial least squares path model (PLS-PM). PLS-PM results revealed higher significant influences of biotic factors on FDOM in the more urbanized river. This study enhances our understanding of FDOM dynamics of rivers with different anthropogenic pressure together with the abiotic and biotic factors driving them.

Of these, 19 were recovered and provided useful data on wintering areas and migration timing.Results: The results indicated that the grebes moulted on freshwater lakes before gradually moving to the sea and later migrating to the wintering areas. Most of the birds wintered on the sea around the British Isles. However, there was surprisingly high variation in wintering strategies and little overlap of wintering areas. Grebes tracked for consecutive years showed high wintering philopatry.Conclusion: Individual Slavonian Grebes may be vulnerable to local environmental conditions, but the high variability in wintering strategies and relatively large non-breeding distribution is expected to make the population generally less sensitive to local environmental conditions in the wintering areas over the long term.

Both heath-grassland and Calamovilfa plots given 50 walking passages showed complete recovery within 1 yr after treatment. Heavier treatments (200 walking passages) on Calamovilfa caused a significant reduction in cover 1 yr later. Heavily trampled heath-grassland plots, although visually similar to their controls, had a continued loss of lichen cover over 1 yr. Several species including Arctostaphylos uva-ursi (L.) Spreng., Andropogon scoparius Michx., some Carex spp., Liatris cylindracea Michx. and Rosa blanda Ait. initiated new growth in the fall following heavy trampling treatment, but only shoots of Arctostaphylos survived the winter.																			0006-3207	1873-2917					1982	24	4					273	283		10.1016/0006-3207(82)90015-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0006-3207(82)90015-5													WOS:A1982PN82400002

This review systematically examines 1141 articles on seasonal frozen lakes from 1991 to 2021, aiming to understand the seasonal variations and control conditions of ice-covered lakes. For the former, we discussed the physical structure and growth characteristics of seasonal ice cover, changes in water environmental conditions and primary production, accumulation and transformation of CO2 beneath the ice, and the role of winter lakes as carbon sources or sinks. We also proposed a concept of structural stratification based on the differences in physical properties of ice and solute content. The latter provided an overview of the ice-covered period (-1.2 d decade-1), lake evaporation (+16% by the end of the 21st century), the response of planktonic organisms (earlier spring blooming: 2.17 d year-1) to global climate change, the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on ice-free events, and the influence of individual characteristics such as depth, latitude, and elevation on the seasonal frozen lakes. Finally, future research directions for seasonally ice-covered lakes are discussed. Considering the limited and less systematic research conducted so far, this study aims to use bibliometric methods to synthesize and describe the trends and main research points of seasonal ice-covered lakes so as to lay an important foundation for scholars in this field to better understand the existing research progress and explore future research directions.					; Wang, Qianqian/HCI-0638-2022	Feng, Weiying/0000-0001-8478-1171; 														2073-4441				OCT	2024	16	19							2727	10.3390/w16192727	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16192727													WOS:001332133400001

This study aimed to define the mean annual pattern of the seasonal successions of phytoplankton species, and to determine whether inter-annual distortions in this seasonal structure occur. We analysed the 25 annual patterns using the STATIS multi-table method. The phytoplankton successions in the first part of the year fitted well with the pattern predicted by the Plankton Ecology Group (PEG) model. But the temporal evolution in the summer phytoplankton community differed from the PEG model, and was subject to between-years differences. We identified three homogeneous periods for the annual patterns: 1974-1985, 1986-1991 (except 1988) and 1992-1996 (including 1988). During the first period, phytoplankton succession followed the reference annual pattern, the typical autumnal community was missing during the second period, and this autumn community developed earlier during the third period. This study reflects the good ability of the phytoplankton community of Lake Geneva to resist both inter-annual fluctuations and brutal shifts in the annual functioning of the system. We believe these shifts resulted from a gradual change in environmental parameters, including the deepening of the phosphorus-depleted layer and a change in its timing as a result of the long-term meteorological changes.																			0142-7873					OCT	2002	24	10					993	1007		10.1093/plankt/24.10.993	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/24.10.993													WOS:000178558900003

Comparisons of limnological parameters of the two phases revealed not only a distinct seasonal extension of N-limitation but also higher water temperatures that rose earlier and lasted longer between spring and autumn from 1997 to 2012. These differences were reflected by threshold conditions and sensitivity functions of the cyanobacteria-specific models evolved by HEA for the two phases. Seven-day-ahead forecasts matched well timings of peaking biomass observed for the three cyanobacteria but partially failed to predict accurate magnitudes, whereby coefficients of determination r (2) ranged between 0.48 and 0.76 for models in Phase I and between 0.42 and 0.69 in Phase II. The threshold conditions of the models quantified ranges of key predictor variables such as water temperature and transparency, concentrations of NO3-N and PO4-P that were symptomatic for sudden outbreaks of high biomass of the three cyanobacteria. Sensitivity functions extracted from 20 best performing models for each of the three cyanobacteria in both phases indicated different abundances between N-fixing Anabaena and Aphanizomenon compared to non-N-fixing Microcystis in response to strengthened N-limitation in Phase II.					; Köhler, Jan/C-2633-2014	Kohler, Jan/0000-0003-1894-2912; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2016	778	1					61	74		10.1007/s10750-015-2442-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-015-2442-7													WOS:000379645500006

In this study, we investigate the seasonal cycles and trends of water budget components (e.g. precipitation P, evapotranspiration ET and runoff Q) in 18 TP river basins during the period 1982-2011 through the use of multi-source datasets (e.g. in situ observations, satellite retrievals, reanalysis outputs and land surface model simulations). A water balance-based two-step procedure, which considers the changes in basin-scale water storage on the annual scale, is also adopted to calculate actual ET. The results indicated that precipitation (mainly snowfall from mid-autumn to next spring), which are mainly concentrated during June-October (varied among different monsoons-impacted basins), was the major contributor to the runoff in TP basins. The P, ET and Q were found to marginally increase in most TP basins during the past 30 years except for the upper Yellow River basin and some sub-basins of Yalong River, which were mainly affected by the weakening east Asian monsoon. Moreover, the aridity index (PET/P) and runoff coefficient (Q/P) decreased slightly in most basins, which were in agreement with the warming and moistening climate in the Tibetan Plateau. The results obtained demonstrated the usefulness of integrating multi-source datasets to hydrological applications in the data-sparse regions. More generally, such an approach might offer helpful insights into understanding the water and energy budgets and sustainability of water resource management practices of data-sparse regions in a changing environment.

J	KAISER, A				KAISER, A			FAT DEPOSITION AND THEORETICAL FLIGHT RANGE OF SMALL AUTUMN MIGRANTS IN SOUTHERN GERMANY	BIRD STUDY												From 1987 to 1989, 11 passerine species caught during their autumn migration on the Mettnau peninsula at Lake Constance (SW Germany) were examined for weight, visible fat deposition and actual fat load using a Soxhlet extraction. From the amount of fat deposited, mean theoretical flight ranges were calculated. Visible stored fat is only deposited in large quantities towards the end of the migration period. Before migration, the mean fat content stored in relation to fat-free dry weight ranges from 9-12 %, whereas during migration it ranges from 13-30%. There is no difference between long- and short-distance migrants. A weight change cannot be accounted for exclusively by fat deposition. The mean weight of first-captures was low in all species. Only 5 of the 11 species studied gained weight more or less extensively during the migration period. All species showed an increase in fat deposition during migration. Since 1972, a marked annual decrease in average body weight during migration was found in the Reed Warbler. On average, water content in relation to fat-free dry weight is between 208 and 254% during migration and between 216 and 270% during the pre-migration period. For the species studied at Mettnau, mean theoretical flight range is 49 to 85 km during the pre-migration period and 84 to 216 km during migration (n = 211 birds). An average flight range of up to 100 km implies short migrational 'legs' from Lake Constance to the nearby Swiss midlands, which is probable if only parts of the small fat reserves are utilized during their flight. Because birds have to increase their initial fat stores considerably to reach and cross the Mediterranean, a low fat deposition rate may lead to problems before they reach their winter quarters. Short flight ranges are discussed in connection with trends of decreasing populations in central Europe.

J	Lemmin, U				Lemmin, Ulrich			Insights into the dynamics of the deep hypolimnion of Lake Geneva as revealed by long-term temperature, oxygen, and current measurements	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												In order to identify or shed light on dominant long-term processes of the deep hypolimnion of Lake Geneva (309 m depth), time series of temperature and horizontal currents and profiles of temperature and oxygen, taken for over a decade in the deepest part of the lake, were analyzed. The focus was on the summer stratification period (May to October). During that period, temperatures near the bottom always increased quasi-linearly with the same gradient and small amplitude variability. Vertical mean temperature gradients in the lowest 60 m of the water column remained nearly constant over the years and were comparable to those of the deep ocean. Mean current velocity at the deepest point was 3.0 +/- 0.5 cm s(-1) and ever-present inertial motions clearly dominated currents. Oxygen decreased quasi-linearly and eutrophication appeared not to affect this rate of decrease. It is suggested that as in the deep ocean, breaking internal waves and friction from decaying inertial motion occurring in the deep hypolimnion strongly contribute to turbulent mixing in that layer. The climate change-induced long-term warming trend seen in the upper layers of the lake was not detected in the deep hypolimnion. Instead, year-to-year climate change-induced variability strongly affected the deep hypolimnion. During cooling in cold winters, lateral advection contributed more to temperature decrease and oxygen renewal in the deep hypolimnion than vertical convection. The present analysis has shown that the dynamics of this layer are highly three-dimensional and that the processes occurring therein cannot be correctly described by traditional one-dimensional concepts.						lemmin, ulrich/0000-0001-8561-0665													0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	2020	65	9					2092	2107		10.1002/lno.11441	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11441		MAR 2020											WOS:000520717900001

THE MICRONUTRIENTS	JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION												Micronutrient uptake by 2 spp. of cattail, Typha latifolia and T. domingensis, in a thermally-stressed South Carolina lake was determined throughout a growing season. Plants of the same age class were sampled from shoot emergence in early spring to shoot senescence in late fall. The uptake pattern varied according to the element, season, and for some elements, thermal regime. Interspecific differences in uptake were observed, with higher elemental concentrations usually occurring in T. latifolia shoots. In both species, Zn and Fe tended to accumulate in the rhizomes, whereas Mn and B accumulated in shoots. Cu concentrations were equivalent in both shoots and rhizomes. Zn was the only micronutrient to demonstrate a consistent decrease in shoot concentration in both species early in the growing season followed by a gradual decline or leveling off in concentration over the rest of the season. The other micronutrients exhibited inconsistent uptake patterns. Fe was the only micronutrient to exhibit consistent enhanced effects due to temperature elevation throughout the growing season. Larger variabilities were observed in micronutrient uptake than in macronutrient uptake.						luvall, jeffrey/0000-0003-0336-2237													0190-4167	1532-4087					1984	7	12					1699	1716		10.1080/01904168409363314	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904168409363314													WOS:A1984ADG6300003

J	GUNZL, H				GUNZL, H			RESTING BUDS OF POTAMOGETON AS FOOD FOR MUTE SWAN (CYGNUS-OLOR) AT LAKE FEDERSEE (SW-GERMANY)	JOURNAL FUR ORNITHOLOGIE												In the highly eutrophicated, shallow Lake Federsee no submersed macrophytes grew, until 1982 a waste water pipeline around the lake was put in operation. In 1983 Potamogeton crispus began to colonize the lake and its abundance increased from year to year. The growth cycle, however, remained very short and the macrophyte always died off between the end of June and the middle of July, after having developed large numbers of resting buds. Simultaneous with the increasing canopies of Potamogeton a rise of Mute Swans in summer and autumn was observed, and because of the absence of Potamogeton and other new food plants it was suggested that at this time the bird mainly feeds on the resting buds of Potamogeton. This was confirmed by investigation of excrements, which sometimes consisted mainly of remnants of resting buds. Therefore it is supposed that Mute Swans essentially affect the recolonization of the lake by Potamogeton crispus and by this way also slow down the re-establishment of a diverse flora and fauna.																			0021-8375					JUL	1993	134	3					345	347		10.1007/BF01640431	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01640431													WOS:A1993LU25100010

Liquefaction potential analysis of Srinagar city, Jammu and Kashmir	EARTHQUAKE GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING FOR PROTECTION AND DEVELOPMENT OF ENVIRONMENT AND CONSTRUCTIONS	Proceedings in Earth and Geosciences				7th International Conference on Earthquake Geotechnical Engineering (ICEGE)	JUN 17-20, 2019	Rome, ITALY	Int Soc Soil Mech & Geotechn Engn, European Assoc Earthquake Engn, Int Geosynthet Soc				Srinagar city is the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir and falls in seismic zone V. For the liquefaction potential analysis of soils in Srinagar city, seventy three borehole locations spread across densely populated areas were selected. Factor of safety (FS) at different depths was determined using standard penetration test results based empirical procedure by Boulanger and Idriss (2015). Liquefaction potential index and probability of liquefaction were also determined. The results indicate shallow strata to be more vulnerable as compared to deeper layers. Western parts of Srinagar (Qamarwari, Bemina etc.) formerly flood basins and currently inhabited, show susceptibility towards liquefaction even up to depths of 10 meters. Majority of the areas have high to very high liquefaction potential, except the hills and the areas lying to north of Dal lake (Illahibagh, Zakura etc.), which show low liquefaction susceptibility owing to presence of stiff soils.					; Zahoor, Falak/GSN-8128-2022	Farooq, Muneeb/0000-0002-8372-4535; 													2639-7749	2639-7757	978-0-429-03127-4				2019	4						5807	5814																WOS:000623514307049

Growth and Survival of Four Sizes of Stocked Largemouth Bass	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We compared growth and survival (including losses to stocking stress and predation) of four sizes of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides in four Illinois reservoirs. Fish were stocked as small fingerlings (55 mm total length) in July, medium fingerlings (100 mm) in August, large fingerlings (150 mm) in September, and advanced fingerlings (200 mm) the subsequent spring. Survival of small fingerlings was very low (catch per unit effort < 1 fish/h of electrofishing in the fall after stocking), and fish stocked as small fingerlings were not observed in electrofishing samples after the spring following stocking. In samples collected soon after stocking, large and advanced fingerlings were larger and more abundant than other sizes. However, in subsequent sampling, there were no differences in size or survival among fish stocked as medium, large, and advanced fingerlings. Long-term growth of stocked fish was similar to that of wild fish, but survival of stocked fish was low for all sizes. Mean initial stocking mortality for fish held in cages was variable but generally low (0.0-5.6%) and was related to lake temperature at stocking. The diets of predators (primarily adult largemouth bass) contained high numbers of small-, medium-, and large-sized fingerlings after stocking, but no predation was observed on advanced fingerlings. Cost of producing fish increased with size, and cost-benefit analysis determined that medium (100-mm) fish had the greatest return per cost. We recommend stocking medium fingerlings because the stocking of larger fingerlings did not produce a significant increase in survival.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				DEC	2009	29	6					1653	1663		10.1577/M09-001.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M09-001.1													WOS:000277113800013
J	West, DT; Moore, RD				West, David Timothy; Moore, Robert Daniel			Influences of upstream reservoir stratification and downstream tidal fluctuations on the summer thermal regime of a regulated coastal river	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												This study focused on the effects of upstream reservoir thermal dynamics and downstream tidal influences on temperatures in a 25-km reach of Alouette River (coastal British Columbia, Canada) below a control dam and upstream of its confluence with Pitt River. Temperature was monitored during summer 2013 using 25 sensors. Water was released from the reservoir through a low level outlet at approximately 2.7 m(3) s(-1), except during late spring when a higher flow was released over the dam spillway. Temperature variations in the lowest section of Alouette River, and in the lower portion of a tributary, were distinct from those further upstream due to backwatering effects associated with a semi-diurnal tide, which can cause flow reversals in Pitt River. An internal seiche was identified in the reservoir during mid-summer that resulted in oscillating releases of warmer and cooler water with an amplitude of up to 6 degrees C and a period of approximately 12 hr. Wavelet analysis and band-pass filtering indicated that the 12-hr signal declined in strength with downstream distance, but remained detectable about 15 km below the dam. In contrast, the 24-hr diel signal increased in strength with distance below the dam. Travel times computed via cross-correlation of the 12-hr signals with that at the low level outlet were within +/- 10%of those estimated from measured mean velocities. Lagrangian tracking of water parcels using the derived travel times indicated that the cooling effect of periodic releases of cold water during the seiching period persisted to the lower extent of the non-tidal reach. The tidally influenced locations experienced higher temperatures than those recorded in the non-tidal portion of Alouette River, although the relative roles of heating in the upstream tidal reach versus upstream advection of water associated with tide-driven flow reversals in Pitt River require further study.																			0885-6087	1099-1085				NOV 30	2020	34	24					4660	4674		10.1002/hyp.13906	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13906		SEP 2020											WOS:000571504900001

By comparing the range of interraker distances of paddlefish (0.06-0.08 mm) to size measurements of different zooplankton taxa, we determined that paddlefish do not consume small rotifers and copepod nauplii as efficiently as they do larger copepods and cladocerans. All zooplankton taxa (rotifers, cladocerans, and copepods) were comprised of relatively small organisms, and community abundance and biomass were dominated by small rotifers and copepod nauplii most of the year. In fall and winter, however, the biomass was dominated by copepods. A bioenergetics model predicted the paddlefish biomass that could be supported in Lake Livingston at a density of 1.17 kg ha(-1), with a range of 0.06 to 10.45 kg ha(-1).

The tropical summer monsoon in the Northern Hemisphere is generally considered to be driven by low latitude solar radiation. Therefore, the summer monsoon strength is near zero-phase to the maximum of Northern Hemisphere Summer Insolation (NHSI). However, records from the Arabian Sea and some other parts of the Indian Ocean (e.g., Andaman Sea) show that a similar to 8 kyr phase difference exists between the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) strength and the northern Hemisphere Summer Insolation maxima, which is obviously different from the records of stalagmites in the East Asia and other marine sediments (e.g., Bay of Bengal). This leads to the "sea-land precession phase paradox " in indian summer monsoon research. This paper systematically summarizes the Indian monsoon variability on orbital scale indicated by various records from the Indian monsoon regions (including oceans and continents) since the late Quaternary. The orbital forcing of Indian monsoon, the potential phase difference between indian summer monsoon and northern Hemisphere Summer Insolation and its possible forcing mechanism(s) are further discussed. The observed phase lag between indian summer monsoon and northern Hemisphere Summer Insolation may be controlled by the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), latent heat transfer between the southern Indian Ocean and the Asian continent, or caused by the lack of tightly coupling between the Arabian Sea summer monsoon proxies and the monsoon intensity. In addition, it is still unclear whether previous monsoon proxies can provide a strong constraint on the intensity of summer monsoon. Environmental magnetism has been widely used in high-resolution dating and the analysis of paleoclimate variabilities in marine and terrestrial sediments, due to its high sensitivity on the rainfall and temperature. Therefore, in order to solve these issues, it is necessary to combine magnetic parameters with geochemical and paleontological parameters for more systematic work in the future.					chen, liang/GZH-2532-2022															2296-6463				SEP 12	2022	10								977250	10.3389/feart.2022.977250	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2022.977250													WOS:000860932100001

A number of planktonic cyanobacteria species form resting stages that survive in the sediments of lakes. The significance of this life history strategy to the ecology of new planktonic populations was investigated in Esthwaite Water, a mesotrophic lake in the English Lake District. 2. A simple trapping technique was used to quantify vertical movements of five species of buoyant gas-vacuolate cyanobacteria from close to the sediments, along a depth transect. 3. 'Recruitment' from the sediments was found to be widespread amongst the cyanobacteria species associated with the summer phytoplankton community. 4. Estimates of the vertical upward fluxes of cyanobacteria based upon trap catches could not account for observed increases in the planktonic populations suggesting that 'recruitment' was not a significant source of biomass. 5. Vertical upward movements of Anabaena solitaria were recorded prior to this species becoming established in the plankton suggesting that benthic populations might be a source of cells for initial pelagic growth of populations of this species. 6. Low numbers of vegetative filaments of Anabaena flos-aquae, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Oscillatoria agardhii were observed in the plankton through the winter. These small overwintering populations appeared to be the primary source of inocula for the large summer populations of these species.

Identification and characterization of Francisella species from natural warm springs in Utah, USA	LETTERS IN APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY												Aims: To characterize Francisella isolated from two natural warm springs in Utah and compare them to a strain isolated from a patient with probable exposure to one of the springs in 2001. Methods and Results: A total of 39 presumptive Francisella isolates were obtained from two springs, Wasatch Hot Spring and Hobo Warm Spring, just north of Salt Lake City, Utah. All isolates were characterized by a combination of biochemical and molecular analyses, including novel PCR/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) typing assays. Thirty-one were identified as F. philomiragia, while the remaining eight were identified as F. tularensis ssp. novicida. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA sequences revealed 27 isolates, which clustered with F. philomiragia, albeit into two distinct clades. The remaining isolates clustered along with other F. tularensis strains including the Utah clinical isolate. Testing with the PCR/ESI-MS assays confirmed the identities of the isolates, but both yielded DNA signatures distinct from that of the clinical isolate. Conclusion: We were successful in isolating several Francisella strains from natural warm springs; however, none appeared to genetically match the original 2001 clinical isolate. Significance and Impact of the Study: This work highlights the presence of viable, potentially pathogenic Franscisella species living in the unique environmental niche of natural warm springs.																			0266-8254	1472-765X				APR	2012	54	4					313	324		10.1111/j.1472-765X.2012.03214.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2012.03214.x								22283482					WOS:000301286000008

Seasonal dynamics of ciliate communities corresponded negatively with course of water bloom formation. The highest numbers and abundances of ciliate species occurred during the spring season when cyanobacterial bloom was not fully developed, while there was an abrupt decrease in both numbers and abundances at the beginning of summer when water bloom culminated. Cyanobacterial blooming thus significantly lowered diversity and equitability of ciliate communities: many rare and sporadic species disappeared and few common taxa flourished and dominated. Nonetheless, these leading ciliates formed a functionally diverse assemblage whose members showed mostly positive contemporaneous and only rarely time-shifted interactions. There were fine filter feeders (Cinetochilum margaritaceum, Dexiotricha granulosa, Paramecium caudatum and Spirostomum teres) grazing heterotrophic bacteria and picocyanobacteria, omnivorous fine to coarse filter feeders (Frontonia leucas) as well as hunters (Coleps hirtus, Holophrya teres and Loxophyllum helus) looking for an individual prey. Also a comparatively rich, anaerobic coenosis comprising various bacterivorous armophoreans and plagiopyleans, developed at the bottom of the reservoir. Our study documents that ciliates form functionally diverse communities with potential to control cyanobacterial blooms in hypertrophic reservoirs.

J	Sarvala, J; Helminen, H; Ventelä, AM				Sarvala, Jouko; Helminen, Harri; Ventela, Anne-Mari			Overfishing of a small planktivorous freshwater fish, vendace (Coregonus albula), in the boreal lake Pyhajarvi (SW Finland), and the recovery of the population	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Vendace (Coregonus albula) is a small and rapidly reproducing planktivorous coregonid species that is known to endure very high fishing pressure. Catch levels of 10-25 kg ha(-1) a(-1) have been sustained for extended periods in several Finnish lakes without signs of fishery-related deterioration of recruitment or decline of spawning stocks. However, data from the lake Sakylan Pyhajarvi (SW-Finland) in the 1990s indicate an episode of recruitment overfishing of the vendace population. The combination of unfavourable spring weather and unusually high abundance of piscivorous fish led to poor vendace recruitment in two successive years (1990, 1991). In spite of the reduced stock, fishing effort remained high, which resulted in excessively high premature mortality, a depressed spawning stock, and markedly reduced catches. Fishing mortality remained high until the mid-1990s. Then, because of the impaired profitability of the fishery, part of the winter seine crews ceased fishing altogether. The ensuing reduced fishing pressure immediately brought about lowered mortality of vendace, and the spawning stock gradually recovered during the late 1990s. In the 2000s the year-class size stabilized to an average level about half of that in the 1980s. Concurrently, the importance of winter seine fishing diminished due to weakening ice conditions in the warming climate, resulting in a reduced overall fishing pressure on the vendace stock. This study shows that even small, rapidly reproducing freshwater planktivores can be overfished. In the case of Pyhajarvi, the fishery was self-regulating through economic forcing. A recovery from overfishing was possible because the biological features of vendace make it a highly resilient species.					; Helminen, Harri/HZJ-8267-2023	Sarvala, Jouko/0000-0002-5016-3049; 													0165-7836	1872-6763				OCT	2020	230								105664	10.1016/j.fishres.2020.105664	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2020.105664													WOS:000553385900032
J	DOWNES, MT				DOWNES, MT			THE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF NITRATE IN AN EUTROPHIC LAKE DURING EARLY STRATIFICATION	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The pattern of nitrate production and consumption in an eutrophic lake was studied during the transition from winter mixing to summer stratification. Nitrification in the sediment was undetectable at the end of the mixing period and net nitrate production before the lake restratified was only equivalent to about 50 % of the ammonia made available at destratification. Rapid hypolimnetic deoxygenation followed by denitrification and dissimilation of nitrate to ammonia prevented any hypolimnetic accumulation of nitrate after stratification. Factors contributing to the rapid hypolimnetic oxygen consumption rate in this lake and its effects on components of the nitrogen cycle are examined. The role of the sediments and water column in nitrate consumption are compared and the consequences of low nitrification on the nitrogen dynamics of the lake are discussed.																			0003-9136					SEP	1991	122	3					257	274																WOS:A1991GN17600001

Although there are several studies on Danube Delta cyanobacteria, little is known about their spatial-temporal patterns and the potential predictive role they can offer. We therefore analyzed the distribution of cyanobacteria in 19 lakes belonging to three lake complexes and tested whether their seasonal dynamics are in line with the predictions of the PEG model. Furthermore, we investigated to which extent cyanobacteria diversity and abundance were related to lake hydrogeomorphological characteristics such as surface, water level, connectivity, water retention, flood risk, and transparency. Although lakes had different seasonal cyanobacterial assemblages, the biovolume and genus richness had a geographical pattern, decreasing from south-east (lakes forming the fluvial delta) towards north-west (lakes forming the maritime delta). Cyanobacteria biovolume reflected largely the PEG model peaking in summer (the fluvial delta) and autumn (the maritime delta). Genus richness followed the same pattern. Cyanobacteria distribution was predicted by various abiotic (e.g., risk of flooding, connectivity) and biotic factors (e.g., submersed macrophytes, phytoplankton diversity, peat deposits). Our study contributes to the understanding of cyanobacteria diversity and distribution in shallow interconnected lakes by revealing the complexity of predictors for geographical and seasonal patterns.

Freezer meals: comparative value of muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) push-ups as late-winter forage for a northern ungulate	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH												One of the more unique aspects of the natural history of muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) is that during early winter they construct push-ups-piles of frozen vegetation-on the surface of frozen lakes. Push-ups are a potentially valuable source of relatively high-quality forage for northern ungulates, which typically become increasingly nutritionally deprived during winter. Because of concerns by local people that reintroduced bison (Bison bison) were eating muskrat push-ups and causing a decline in some local populations, we assessed the comparative value of push-ups as late-winter forage for bison. We collected vegetation from 18 push-ups and 18 shoreline sites (i.e. wet sedge meadows), distributed equally from 3 lakes, and used wet chemistry techniques to assess their nutritional quality (i.e. percent crude protein, neutral detergent fibre, lignin, and total digestible nutrients, plus major and trace minerals). General linear models revealed that most variables assessed differed significantly by SITE (push-up versus shoreline; 13 of 15 variables), LAKE (3 lakes; 9 of 15), and their interaction (SITE*LAKE; 11 of 15). Our data suggest that muskrat push-ups may provide a supplement to winter forage used by bison in our study area by helping to boost protein intake as well as providing minerals that may be deficient in their late-winter diets, such as Ca, Fe, and Cu. As such, bison should seek push-ups in late winter to supplement their diet and improve their nutritional condition at a time when they may be seasonally impoverished. Our study also demonstrates that nutritional quality of push-ups varies significantly between nearby lakes-likely due to their unique biogeochemistry. As such, muskrat push-ups on some lakes may be more favoured by bison than those on other lakes. Whether our results may be extended to other species of northern ungulates or other ecological regions, however, awaits testing.

J	Ahas, R; Aasa, A				Ahas, R; Aasa, A			Impact of landscape features on spring phenological phases of maple and bird cherry in Estonia	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												We analysed the spatial distribution of the pollination of maple (Acer platanoides L.) and bird cherry (Prunus padus L.) in Estonia on the basis of phenological data from the time series for 1948-1995, in 27 observation points, and from the special field observation programme 1996-1999, in 46 observation points. Phenological maps show that these springtime phenophases spread in the landscape at a rate of 3-6 days per 100 km, with different rates in early and late springs. The maple has a steeper gradient on northeastern islands and the bird cherry on the western islands; the values of standard deviation have a similar spatial pattern. The distribution of phenological phases in Estonia is influenced by differences between the temperature regimes of the Baltic Sea and inland areas, different climatic conditions in north-eastern Estonia, local altitude-impact of uplands with an absolute height of 150-300 m asl, and the effects of bigger lakes and wetland areas. On the basis of spring phenology, three seasonally different landscape types can be determined in Estonia: (1) Relatively continental South-East Estonian Plain and uplands - have the earliest spring with the smallest deviations and stable intervals between phases, (2) Central, western and northern Estonian plains - with temperate influence of the temperature regime of the Baltic Sea, and big variations from year to year. Large variability is caused by the presence and duration of ice cover on the sea in cold springs, and direct access by warm air masses in early springs. (3) North-east Estonia - has the most boreal climate with longer snow cover and very late spring, influenced by arctic air masses, local influence of the Baltic Sea, uplands, and large wetlands.

J	Kruk, M				Kruk, Marek			THE EFFECT OF EXTREME WINTER CONDITIONS ON ELEMENT FLUXES IN A SMALL FORESTED WATERSHED IN NE EUROPE	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The effect of contrasting meteorological conditions on hydrology, hydrochemistry and input-output budgets of nutrients and metals was examined in a small (2.8 ha) forested watershed of the Masurian Lakeland (NE Poland). The conditions of a frosty and dry continental winter activated an outflow of underground water originating from deeper water resources. The chemical composition of this outflow differed from watershed waters outflowing during mild winters with respect to SO4-S, Ca and Mg, which had lower concentrations, and NH4-N and K, which exhibited higher concentrations. An exceptionally severe winter affected also element fluxes in the examined watershed during the subsequent growing season. In order to show this impact, a comparison was made between the balances of elements moving through the investigated forest ecosystem during the growing seasons following mild and extremely cold winters. A biogeochemical effect of a frosty winter drought in a small post-glacial forested watershed, observed during vegetation growth (April - October), involved increased mineralization of nitrogen and phosphorus: a higher level of DON and DOP retention and a lower level of SRP and NO3-N retention. The increase in mineralization and the "opening" of biogeochemical cycles were also reflected in the loss of metals as K, Na, Ca and Mg.					; Kruk, Marek/I-8348-2012	Kruk, Marek/0000-0001-8806-863X; 													1505-2249						2012	60	4					741	754																WOS:000312519300007

These egg banks have important effects on the ecology of populations and communities in terms of phenology, population densities, the probability of extinction, species diversity and habitat connectivity in time and space. They also have important consequences for the evolutionary versatility of populations. Although diapause and dormant egg banks in freshwater zooplankton have been studied for several decades, little is known about the quantitative contribution of egg production and hatching to yearly egg bank budgets and their seasonality in natural ponds and lakes. Here we quantified inter- and intra-annual variation in hatching and dormant egg production in the water flea Daphnia magna in two natural shallow ponds in Flanders (Belgium) using high-intensity sampling and in situ measurements. Hatching started in spring and occurred in several bouts (April-July), accumulating to a yearly average total of 3.5 x 10(3) hatchlings m(-2). Dormant egg production occurred in one-to-three bouts mainly during late spring and summer (May-August), resulting in a total yearly production ranging from 1.2 x 10(4) up to 17.3 x 10(4) ephippia m(-2). In both years, there was an average surplus of 3.14 x 10(4) and 15.24 x 10(4) ephippia produced m(-2) for ponds OM2 and OM3, respectively, contributing to the accumulation of the persistent egg bank. We discuss the ecological and evolutionary consequences of both the high number of ephippia that are produced and the high number of hatchlings at the start of each growing season.

Cysticercoids of this parasite were found for the first time in the Algerian populations of Artemia salina in winter of 2000 and 2001 in Chott Marouane and spring of 2003 in Sebkha Ez-Zemoul. The prevalence ranged between 10 and 33% for the two examined Artemia populations. The intensity of infection was 1-3 cysticercoids per individual. The abdomen was the most targeted site of infection (95% of the population of Sebkha Ez-Zemoul) followed by the thorax and the ovisac. Infected females were less fertile than uninfected ones (24.83 vs 43.70 cysts/brood) in Sebkha Ez-Zemoul or castrated in Chott Marouane.

J	LENZ, PH				LENZ, PH			LIFE-HISTORY ANALYSIS OF AN ARTEMIA POPULATION IN A CHANGING ENVIRONMENT	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The Artemia monica Verrill population in Mono Lake, California [USA] has 2 generations per yr. Despite similarities in the year-to-year life history patterns, some important differences developed between 1979 and 1981. The 1st generation hatches from overwintering cysts in early spring and reaches maturity by the end of May. The 1st-generation females reproductive ovoviviparously, giving rise to a 2nd generation which matures between mid-July and Aug. In July, both 1st and 2nd generation females begin producing overwintering cysts. The population reaches its maximum in late summer, then declines to low numbers by Nov. The abundance of the 1st generation in June declined from a mean of 20,000 m-2 to 2400 m-2. Despite the smaller 1st generation, the 2nd generation in 1980 and 1981 was at least as abundant as in 1979. These differences are indicative of a change in the Artemia population dynamics in Mono Lake.

A Comparison of Two Methods for Sampling Bluegill and Redear Sunfish in Small Impoundments	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Bluegill Lepomis macrochirus and Redear Sunfish L. microlophus are highly regarded recreational species throughout North America. Management of these species relies on sampling methods that accurately and efficiently describe population characteristics of the target population. Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides and crappies Pomoxis spp. are commonly sampled with spring electrofishing and fall fyke netting, respectively. If lepomids can be effectively sampled concurrently with Largemouth Bass or crappies with one of these sampling methods, it would improve sampling efficiency in small impoundments. Our objective was to compare two sampling methods (North American standard fyke netting and electrofishing) for sampling Bluegill and Redear Sunfish populations in small impoundments by comparing size structure, sampling precision (relative standard error), and sampling efficiency (effort needed to collect 125 stock-length fish). Typically, spring electrofishing caught a wider size range of Bluegill and Redear Sunfish than fyke nets, but proportional size distribution was similar between gears. However, length frequencies differed between gears in all impoundments for Bluegill and in three of five impoundments for Redear Sunfish. Electrofishing typically caught a greater proportion of large lepomids than fyke nets in those cases, though the differences were subtle and management decisions would likely be similar using data from either gear. With the exception of Pawhuska Lake (which had low catch rates leading to poor precision for both species and both gears), catch rates were typically high enough to collect sufficient numbers (125 stock-length fish) of Bluegill to adequately describe size structure with 5-20 net-nights for fyke nets or 4-28 transects for electrofishing, but Redear Sunfish sampling would require considerably more sampling effort to produce sufficient amounts of fish in most cases (24-79 net-nights for fyke nets or 12-57 transects for electrofishing). Spring electrofishing is the more precise (lower relative standard error) of the two sampling methods for collecting lepomids.

Mean daily air temperature was calculated from the data in three ways, viz.: dividing the total of 72 readings by 72 (the integration method), adding the minimum and maximum temperatures and dividing by 2 (the International Standard), and adding the 0800 and 1700 hour readings and dividing by 2. The integration method provides a lower reading for most monthly and yearly data, and there are substantial differences (up to 7 degrees C) for mean daily air temperatures calculated by different methods. These are largest in winter and least in summer. Differences increase with continentality and the integration method clearly gives a more accurate measure of heat flux and climatic change, and should be calculated along with the minimum-maximum average for automated stations.																			0372-8854					JUN	1995	39	2					203	210																WOS:A1995RL29500003

Metals in the water and fish exhibited a significant seasonal and regional variation, in which all metals attained their maximum value during summer, while the lowest levels were found during winter. The concentration of different metals in water, plankton, and fish tissues followed the same order: Zn > Cu > Pb > Cd. The mean concentrations of metals in the water were as follow: Cu, 0.055; Zn, 0.311; Cd, 0.020; and Pb, 0.022 mg/L. The Cd level in the water was found to be higher than the permissible limit recommended for drinking water. Metals in plankton were much higher than those of water and fish. Gills of the examined fish contained the highest concentration of all of the measured metals, while muscles retained the lowest. In spite of the contamination of Lake Manzala by heavy metals, the level of the metals in fish muscle (the edible part) did not exceed the recommended permissible limit and the fish is considered safe for human consumption.						bahnasawy, mohamed/0000-0002-1603-5270													1300-0179	1303-6114					2011	35	2					271	280		10.3906/zoo-0810-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.3906/zoo-0810-6													WOS:000288975600013

Microcystis spp. biomass and intra-/extracellular MCs were significantly correlated with water temperature, suggesting the importance of temperature in cyanobacterial blooming in the lake. Higher MC concentration was found in summer and autumn, and peaks of Microcystis biomass and intra-/extracellular MC concentrations were all present in October. Spatially, risk of MCs was higher in littoral zones than in the pelagic area. There were significant correlations between N or P concentrations, and Microcystis biomass or MC content, suggesting that N and P levels affected MC production through influencing Microcystis biomass. Intra-/extracellular MCs and Microcystis biomass had negative exponential relationships with TN:TP, and the maximum values all occurred when TN:TP was <25. Multivariate analyses by PCCA indicated that intra- and extracellular MC concentrations had better correlations with biological factors (such as Microcystis biomass and chl-a) than with physicochemical factors. The maximum MC concentration reached up to 17 mu g/L MC-LReq, considerably higher than the drinking water safety standard (1 mu g/L) recommended by the WHO. So it is necessary to take measures to reduce the exposure risk of cyanobacterial toxins to human beings.

Most largemouth bass movement was < 50 m h(-1) in all seasons and at all times of day. During the day largemouth bass were offshore in deeper water near large woody structures and moved little. Movement was lower during dusk and night periods, and a general movement towards shoreline areas was evident. Water depths where largemouth bass were located had bimodal distributions in all seasons and diel periods, with one mode typically at depths < 1 m and another around 3 m. Home ranges were typically largest in the summer and smallest in the winter. Largemouth bass appeared to divide their time between an offshore resting area, primarily occupied during the day, and a near-shore area, where foraging presumably occurred, primarily used during low-light periods. The largemouth bass population in Lake Seminole consists of multiple overlapping subpopulations, offering the opportunity for embayment-specific management.

Airborne ash was collected daily with standard high-volume samplers and other equipment that sampled the ash at selected windspeeds. Analysis of high-volume filtered deposits showed poor linear correlations to local meteorological conditions. At Moses Lake, weights of windspeed-selected samples indicated an exponential increase in suspended material with increasing windspeed. Wind tunnel tests with ash from two locations varying in distance from the volcano showed that the finer ash fractions from both locations became airborne at similar windspeeds. Threshold wind velocity was about 12 km h-1 for newly deposited ash, compared to more than 69 km h-1 for ash consolidated by wetting and drying.																			1352-2310	1873-2844					1986	20	3					421	425		10.1016/0004-6981(86)90081-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0004-6981(86)90081-8													WOS:A1986A822300001

Spatial structure of the 8200 cal yr BP event in northern Europe	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												A synthesis of well-dated high-resolution pollen records suggests a spatial structure in the 8200 cal yr BP event in northern Europe. The temperate, thermophilous tree taxa, especially Corylus, Ulmus, and Alnus, decline abruptly between 8300 and 8000 cal yr BP at most sites located south of 61 degrees N, whereas there is no clear change in pollen values at the sites located in the North-European tree-line region. Pollen-based quantitative temperature reconstructions and several other, independent palaeoclimate proxies, such as lacustrine oxygen-isotope records, reflect the same pattern, with no detectable cooling in the sub-arctic region. The observed patterns challenges the general view of the widespread occurrence of the 8200 cal yr BP event in the North Atlantic region. An alternative explanation is that the cooling during the 8200 cal yr BP event took place mostly during the winter and spring, and the ecosystems in the south responded sensitively to the cooling during the onset of the growing season. In contrast, in the sub-arctic area, where the vegetation was still dormant and lakes ice-covered, the cold event is not reflected in pollen-based or lake-sediment-based records.

J	Stefanidis, K; Dimitriou, E				Stefanidis, Konstantinos; Dimitriou, Elias			Differentiation in Aquatic Metabolism between Littoral Habitats with Floating-Leaved and Submerged Macrophyte Growth Forms in a Shallow Eutrophic Lake	WATER												The metabolic balance between gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R) is known to display large spatial and temporal variations within shallow lakes. Thus, although estimation of aquatic metabolism using free-water measurements of dissolved oxygen concentration has become increasingly common, the explanation of the variance in the metabolic regime remains an extremely difficult task. In this study, rates of GPP, respiration (R) and the metabolic balance (net ecosystem production, NEP) were estimated in four littoral habitats with different macrophyte growth forms (floating-leaved vs submerged) over a 28-month period in lake of Kastoria (Greece), a shallow eutrophic lake. Our results showed that net heterotrophy prevailed over the studied period, suggesting that allochthonous organics fuel respiration processes in the littoral. Temporal variation in the metabolic rates was driven mainly by the seasonal variation in irradiance and water temperature, with the peak of metabolic activity occurring in summer and early autumn. Most importantly, significant spatial variation among the four habitats was observed and associated with the different macrophyte growth forms that occurred in the sites. The results highlight the importance of habitat specific characteristics for the assessment of metabolic balance and underline the potentially high contribution of littoral habitats to the whole lake metabolism.

A 10,500-yr-long vegetation, fire and climate history from Lower Decker Lake in the Sawtooth Range provides information from a new region. Initial forests dominated by pine and Douglas-fir were replaced by open Douglas-fir forest at 8420 cal yr BP, marking the onset of warmer conditions than present. Presence of closed Douglas-fir forest between 6000 and 2650 cal yr BP suggests heightened summer drought in the middle Holocene. Closed lodgepole pine forest developed at 2650 cal yr BP and fires became more frequent after 1450 cal yr BP. This shift from Douglas-fir to lodgepole pine forest was probably facilitated by a combination of cooler summers, cold winters, and more severe fires than before. Five drought episodes, including those at 8200 cal yr BP and during the Medieval Climate Anomaly, were registered by brief intervals of lodgepole pine decline, an increase in fire activity, and mistletoe infestation. The importance of a Holocene perspective when assessing the historical range of variability is illustrated by the striking difference between the modern forest and that which existed 3000 yr ago.

Prewinter mean length was 15 mm greater, mean weight was 8 g greater, and mean K-n was 5% greater at the upstream site than at the downstream site. The prewinter mean length of age-0 freshwater drum was significantly greater in 1997 (115 mm) than in 1998 (109 mm), but K-n was significantly greater in 1998 (107) than in 1997 (102). There was no evidence that density-dependent interactions influenced prewinter growth and K-n. Size-selective overwinter mortality of the smallest size-classes of freshwater drum occurred at two of three sites during the 1997-1998 winter, and K-n decreased 9-15%. Size-selective overwinter mortality of the 1998 cohort of freshwater drum did not occur during the 1998-1999 winter, and K-n declined 0-10%. A prolonged growing season (through early December 1998), in conjunction with less severe winter water temperature conditions, apparently minimized the incidence of size-selective overwinter mortality for the 1998 cohort of freshwater drum. We conclude that size-selective overwinter mortality of age-0 freshwater drum occurs in the lower channelized Missouri River but depends on the length of the prewinter growing season, winter duration, and the severity of winter water temperatures.																			0002-8487					MAR	2004	133	2					385	398		10.1577/01-136	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/01-136													WOS:000220366600012

Perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) were the dominant compounds, with average concentrations of 12.79 and 9.90 ng/L, respectively. For Cl-PFESAs, only C8 Cl-PFESA could be detected, and its concentration ranged from <MLQ to 6.93 ng/L. Higher concentrations of Sigma PFASs were observed in the northern and eastern regions of Beijing. The highest and lowest levels of Sigma PFASs were found in summer and winter, respectively. For C8 Cl-PFESA, there were no significant differences in the concentrations among different sampling sites. Additionally, risk assessments indicated that the studied PFASs at present levels might pose a low risk to aquatic organisms (green algae, Daphnia sp. and fish). However, further studies should be conducted on the combined risk from PFASs or the risk to other sensitive species in aquatic environments. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

From studies on food selectivity, however, little evidence exists that small, gape-limited age-0 fish strongly influence Daphnia populations. Therefore, we measured gape sizes and compared gape-size dependent feeding in age-0 fish of two related percid species, perch (Perca fluviatilis) and zander (Stizostedion lucioperca). We sampled fish and Daphnia in the biomanipulated Bautzen reservoir (Germany) during spring and early summer over 2 years. The small gape size of newly hatched fish prevented predation on daphnids until mid-May. Later, feeding intensity on daphnids by fish (expressed as the index of relative importance IRI) closely corresponded to the Daphnia density, independent of gape size of fish. However, the gape size of fish predicts both species-selective and size-selective feeding on daphnids in perch and zander. Only perch and zander > 20-25 mm TL fed on larger-than-average daphnids and positively selected daphnids, independent of Daphnia density. Although growth of fish and Daphnia densities differed between both years studied, slopes and intercepts of the linear relationships between gape size and selectivity for daphnids did not differ. Consequently, only in those years in which age-0 fish are sufficiently large to consume large, mature Daphnia in early summer, can we expect a midsummer Daphnia decline.

Hot spots and hot moments of planktonic nitrogen fixation in a eutrophic southern reservoir	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Reservoirs have been identified as hot spots of biogeochemical activity, although they are known to exhibit pronounced temporal and spatial variability in planktonic community dynamics. Results from this 19-month study at 5 locations on a southern polymictic reservoir identify pronounced temporal (seasonal and interannual) and significant spatial variability in planktonic nitrogen fixation. Planktonic nitrogen fixation was found to be high during the warmest portion of the year and undetectable for most of the rest of the year. Interannual variability between 2 consecutive summer periods was high and likely due to differences in rainfall pattern and resulting differences in ambient nutrient concentrations and flushing rates. Rates during the dry summer exceeded those during the following summer when unexpected summer rains occurred. Spatial differences in areal and volumetric rates were also significant. Volumetric rates were highest in the inflow transition zone of a river draining a watershed impacted by dairy operations, with inflows exhibiting low N:P ratios. Areal rates were highest in the deeper and clearer portions of the reservoir. Areal rates of nitrogen fixation varied among the 5 stations by a factor of 4.4 in the dry summer and by a factor of 22 in the wetter summer.					; Scott, Thad/AAF-7151-2020	Scott, Thad/0000-0002-9487-9698; 													1040-2381	2151-5530					2010	26	2					95	103	PII 924740521	10.1080/07438141.2010.489765	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438141.2010.489765													WOS:000280285300005

Six faunal groupings are recognized for a non-parametric analysis of the data and significance levels are given for the between-station and between-year differences recorded. The mean density of macroinvertebrates (1.2 mm mesh sieve) estimated for the lake as a whole increased by 28.5% in the 2nd yr (2519 to 3237/m2); the estimated mean biomass in g/m2 increased by 86% wet wt (8.61 to 16.01) and 196% dry wt (1.74 to 5.15). Mollusks contributed substantially to the increased standing crop which was accompanied by increased development of macrophytes. A comparative study of the diets of roach in 2 size groups in winter and summer is described. The variety of food items consumed was greater than in a preliminary study in May 1969 and, for the roach sampled, the average quantity of food consumed per fish increased after the 1969/1970 winter. The possible relationships between invertebrate standing crop, roach diet and previously reported changes in the growth of the roach are discussed and an explanation is offered concerning the sequence of biological changes observed in the lake.																			0022-1112	1095-8649					1980	16	2					123	144		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1980.tb03692.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1980.tb03692.x													WOS:A1980JP21600002

In winter 2019, we found non-circulated water masses at the bottom of the lake where the basin is 90 m deep. This is the first observation of an incomplete vertical circulation event since we started monitoring Lake Biwa in 1979. Analysis of water quality monitoring and meteorological data shows that weaker cooling and weaker winds during winter 2019 affected vertical circulation. Dissolved oxygen concentrations in the bottom layer recovered even after the appearance of a seasonal thermocline. However, the concentrations remained below that in the surface layer.

Under-ice plankton community response to snow removal experiment in bog lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Although previously overlooked, winter is now seen as a period of significant biological activity in the annual cycle of north-temperate lakes. Research suggests a future of reduced ice cover duration and altered snow conditions could significantly change the functioning of aquatic ecosystems. This study seeks to explore the possible repercussions of changing ice and snow dynamics on aquatic biological communities, particularly at lower trophic levels. To explore plankton community responses to changing under-ice light conditions, we performed a whole-lake manipulation by removing all of the snow from the surface of a north temperate bog lake in northern Wisconsin. Over three winters, samples were collected under ice in the study lake, South Sparkling Bog. The first winter, 2018-2019, served as a reference year during which snow was not removed from the lake and was followed by two subsequent winters of snow removal during 2019-2020 and 2020-2021. Data collected included phytoplankton and zooplankton abundances and taxa, chlorophyll a, dissolved organic carbon, light, Secchi depth, and ice and snow thickness. In our snow removal years, increased light availability in the water column shifted the phytoplankton community from low-biomass, mixed community of potential mixotrophs, unicellular cyanobacteria and Chlorophytes to dominance by photoautotrophs, and rotifer zooplankton densities increased. Ice condition, specifically the thickness of white ice vs. black ice, was a major driver in the magnitude of change between years. This research improves our understanding of how plankton communities might respond to climate-change driven shifts in winter dynamics for north temperate systems.					; Lottig, Noah/AAE-4650-2020	Gerrish, Gretchen/0000-0001-6192-5734; Whitaker, Emily/0009-0000-1109-6544; Lottig, Noah/0000-0003-1599-8144; Socha, Ellen/0000-0003-3396-7587; GORSKY, ADRIANNA/0000-0002-5107-8188													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	2023	68	5					1001	1018		10.1002/lno.12319	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.12319		MAR 2023											WOS:000956595100001
J	Sun, JQ; Ming, J; Zhang, MQ; Yu, S				Sun, Jianqi; Ming, Jing; Zhang, Mengqi; Yu, Shui			Circulation Features Associated with the Record-Breaking Rainfall over South China in June 2017	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												In June 2017, south China suffered from intense rainfall that broke the record spanning the previous 70 years. In this study, the large-scale circulations associated with the south China June rainfall are analyzed. The results show that the anomalous Pacific-Japan (PJ) pattern is a direct influence on south China June rainfall or East Asian early summer rainfall. In addition, the Australian high was the strongest in June 2017 during the past 70 years, which can increase the equatorward flow to northern Australia and activate convection over the Maritime Continent. Enhanced convection over the Maritime Continent can further enhance local meridional circulation along East Asia, engendering downward motion over the tropical western North Pacific and enhancing the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) and upward motion over south China, which increases the rainfall therein. In addition, a strong wave train pattern associated with North Atlantic air-sea interaction was observed in June 2017 at Northern Hemispheric mid- to high latitudes; it originated from the North Atlantic and propagated eastward to East Asia, resulting in an anomalous anticyclone over the Mongolian-Baikal Lake region. This anomalous anticyclone produced strong northerly winds over East Asia that encountered the southerly associated with the WPSH over south China, thereby favoring intense rainfall over the region. Case studies of June 2017 and climate research based on data during 1979-2017 and 1948-2017 indicate that the extremities of the atmospheric circulation over south Europe and Australian high and their coupling with the PJ pattern could be responsible for the record-breaking south China rainfall in June 2017.					明, 经典/JXN-4437-2024; Sun, Jianqi/A-7084-2016; Yu, Shui/JJE-8350-2023; Zhang, Mengqi/IWU-9043-2023														0894-8755	1520-0442				SEP	2018	31	18					7209	7224		10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0903.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0903.1													WOS:000440402800003

Winter residency and foraging of non-native round goby populations in Great Lakes tributary streams	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Investigations of winter diets and foraging in fish are rare, and less so for migratory species in the temperate zone. In the Great Lakes, the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) is known to out-migrate from nearshore habitats to offshore depths in the winter months. However, in Great Lake tributaries, populations of this fish were found up to 25 km upstream during winter months. Distance upstream was a predictor of out-migration behavior with populations farthest upstream remaining as winter residents, whereas populations nearest the lakes out-migrated. Distance inland was also a predictor of fish total length, but not Fulton's condition index. Seasonal resources and local prey availability shaped the diets of these fish, but resource use remained unchanged over time since invasion. Total length and body condition also remained unchanged over time since the invasion. Plasticity in both diet and migration behavior seems to be beneficial traits for the inland invasion success of this fish.						pennuto, christopher/0000-0002-0584-4005													0022-1112	1095-8649				DEC	2023	103	6					1401	1408		10.1111/jfb.15540	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.15540		SEP 2023						37632308					WOS:001066473200001

The macroinvertebrate fauna was dominated by insects, primarily chironomids. Semi-aquatic neustonic taxa, including an aphid and a springtail, were common; this is in contrast with most aquatic plant-invertebrate studies, in which neustonic insects are seldom collected because of sampling bias. Over the entire season, P. pectinatus biomass and the densities of four insect taxa (Anopheles spp. mosquitoes, Hydrellia sp. brineflies, Ademon sp. parasitic wasps, and coenagrionid damselflies) were significantly correlated. These correlations resulted from both similar overall phenologies of the plant and each of the insect taxa, and ecological relationships in which P. pectinatus provides either a specialized habitat or food source. Macroinvertebrate numbers were highest in mid-summer, when P. pectinatus forms a dense floating canopy; microcrustaceans were more common during plant senescence in early autumn. Individuals of some taxa may be distributed in proportion to plant biomass; this occurred commonly in damselflies, perhaps as a result of territoriality in these nymphs.

J	Caldwell, J; Rajagopalan, B; Danner, E				Caldwell, Jason; Rajagopalan, Balaji; Danner, Eric			Statistical Modeling of Daily Water Temperature Attributes on the Sacramento River	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING												The Sacramento River is the largest river in California, and an important source of water for agricultural, municipal, and industrial users. Input to the Sacramento River comes from Shasta Lake and is controlled by operators of Shasta Dam, who are challenged with meeting the competing needs of these users while also maintaining a cold water habitat for Endangered Species Act (ESA) listed winter-run Chinook salmon. The cold water habitat goals are constrained by the volume of cold water storage in the lake, which operators attempt to selectively deploy throughout the critical late summer/fall window. To make informed decisions about the release of this limited cold water resource, skillful forecasts of downstream water temperature attributes at the seasonal time scale are crucial. To this end, we offer a generalized linear modeling (GLM) framework with a local polynomial method for function estimation, to provide predictions of a range of daily water temperature attributes (maximum daily water temperature, daily temperature range, number of hours of threshold exceedance, and probability of threshold exceedance/nonexceedance). These attributes are varied in nature (i.e.,discrete, continuous, categorical, etc.), and the GLM provides a general framework to modeling all of them. A suite of predictors that impact water temperatures are considered, including current and prior day flow, water temperature of upstream releases, air temperature, and precipitation. A two-step model selection is proposed. First, an objective method based on Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) is used in a global model to select the best set of predictors for each attribute; then the parameters of the local polynomial method for the selected best set of predictors are obtained using generalized cross validation (GCV). Daily weather ensembles from stochastic weather generators are coupled to the GLM models to provide ensembles of water temperature attributes and consequently, the probability distributions to obtain risk estimates. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by modeling water temperature attributes for a temperature compliance point on the Sacramento River below Shasta Dam. Regulations on the dam depress the water temperature forecasting skill; to show this, we present skillful results from applying the approach to an unregulated location in the Pacific Northwest. The proposed method is general, can be ported across sites, and can be used in climate change studies.

J	Jonsson, A; Jansson, M				Jonsson, A; Jansson, M			Sedimentation and mineralisation of organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in a large humic lake, northern Sweden	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Lake Ortrasket is a large (7.3 km(2)) and deep (64 m) humic (DOC 10 mg.L-1) lake in northern Sweden. Sediment trap data (gross sedimentation) and sediment core data (net sedimentation) has been used to calculate sedimentation and mineralisation of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, aluminium and total particulate matter (TPM). Yearly gross sedimentation of nitrogen and organic carbon was higher than yearly net sedimentation caused by an annual sediment mineralisation of 54 % and 32 % of gross sedimentation, respectively. Annual gross sedimentation of phosphorus, iron, aluminium and TPM equalled annual net sedimentation and no significant sediment mineralisation of these elements was calculated. The annual retention (input-output) of organic a carbon and nitrogen approximately equalled net sedimentation. Sediment mineralisation of nitrogen resulted in an accumulation of nitrate in the water column of the lake during periods of lake stratification. Approximately 2/3 of the nitrogen mineralised in and lost from the sediment was transported out of the lake (as nitrate) via the outlet during turnover in spring and autumn. Remaining 1/3 was assumed to be lost through sediment denitrification, equalling a denitrification rate of about 1 mgN.m(-2).y(-1).																			0003-9136					NOV	1997	141	1					45	65																WOS:000071565800004

Its population was studied in a hypersaline lake located in Crimea with field sampling from 2019 to 2023, as well as in different laboratory experiments. Here, the COI fragments was sequenced in two color morphs (gray and pink), and two unique COI haplotypes independent of the morph were found. They belong to MOTU3 according to the classification of Hupalo et al., 2019, which is entirely consistent with this genetic group being distributed along the coasts of the Black and Azov Seas. The distribution of G. aequicauda in the lake has never been uniform; significantly higher concentrations were observed in the thickets of seagrass Ruppia, in the spring on average more than 5 times. The highest recorded abundance of this species in the lake was 89,200 m(-3), and its total biomass then was 558 g m(-3). In spring and summer, their numerical abundance in the Ruppia thickets was proportional to the density of Ruppia shoots and increased exponentially from March to July. The abundance of G. aequicauda observed in the lake even exceeded the values found in brackish and marine conditions. This species has three generations in Lake Moynaki during the growing season. It can be cultured at different salinities, including very successfully in 45 to 65 g L-1. It would be possible to obtain 5000 kg of its wet weight (approximately 710 kg of dry weight), per year from a hypersaline pond of 1 ha (0.01 km(2)).

The advantage of knowledge-based and model-based techniques is that they are normally more robust than for instance supervised Bayes classification methods, because they are virtually independent of the specific SAR data used and the specific test site used, The classification scheme used is based on a scheme originally proposed by the University of Michigan, and it has been modified to cope with the different object classes in this case. The classification was evaluated using a large number of test areas, and for the broad classes forest, lake, spring crops, and winter crops very good results were obtained using acquisitions at both L- and C-band in April.

Four of the spring systems (East Sandia Springs, Independence Creek, Big Bend National Park Refugium Pond, and Clear Creek) did not contain red-rim melania snails in 1999 and 2011. Four spring systems that were populated with snails (San Felipe Creek, San Solomon Springs, Phantom Lake, and Diamond Y Springs) contained the trematode and were positive for branchial infection in fish except Diamond Y Springs which contained uninfected snails and fish. Since 1999, two additional spring systems, Pinto Creek and Devils River, contained the trematode. We found a high prevalence of branchial infection for fish collected regardless of species. Seventeen of the 21 species of fish collected from the spring systems were positive for infection by trematodes. On average, the most infected genera were Micropterus and Lepomis followed in decreasing order by Etheostoma, Dionda, Astyanax, Cichlasoma, Notropis, Cyprinella, Gambusia, Ictalurus, and Hypostomus. Seven state-listed or federally listed species we collected had a relatively high percentage (mean = 52%) of developing metacercarial cysts except E. grahami (mean = 14%). Our laboratory study suggests that, for Gambusia, rates of infection by trematodes are species-specific with G. affinis having significantly more cysts than did G. nobilis and G. gaigei. Our work extended the documented range of red-rim melania snails and C. formosanus in Texas.					; Huston, Daniel/K-4455-2019	Huston, Daniel Colgan/0000-0002-1015-4703; 													0038-4909	1943-6262				JUN	2014	59	2					212	220		10.1894/F08-FRG-06.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1894/F08-FRG-06.1													WOS:000350655600008

PRODUCTION OF THE CHIRONOMID POLYPEDILUM-PAVIDUS AND ITS ROLE AS FOOD FOR 2 FISH SPECIES	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Lake Okaro, a nutrient-rich lake on the central volcanic plateau of the North Island, New Zealand, supported a maximum littoral population of the chironomid Polypedilum pavidus Hutton of 309,000 larvae m-2 in 1983/84. This population depended for food on the shoreward drift of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae). The larvae were an important food source for the benthic bully Gobiomorphus cotidianus McDowall from January to June. From June to December the cladoceran Ceriodaphnia dubia Richard was prominent in the diet when the fish moved towards the open water of the lake. The bully removed up to 128% of chironomid production only when population density of the larvae was low. At other times fish predation had little impact on the larvae. Most larvae were eaten by bullies during the day. Bullies caught at night were on average larger and preferred to eat small individuals of their own species. The smelt Retropinna retropinna (Richardson) played a minor predatory role in the lake. It ate P. pavidus larvae at all times but favoured C. dubia in winter and small bullies in autumn. In Lake Okaro cyanobacterial food supply was of overriding importance to the chironomid population but fish predation was a minor influence. Both fish species were opportunistic feeders switching seasonally to the most readily available prey.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1988	22	3					327	335		10.1080/00288330.1988.9516305	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1988.9516305													WOS:A1988R113000003

At West Dongting Lake National Nature Reserve (WDLNNR), China, land-use change and hydrology alternation are compounding factors that have affected important wintering areas for migratory waterbirds. Presently, changes in the hydrology and landscape have reshaped natural wintering habitats and their availability, though the impact of hydrological management on habitat selection of wintering waterbirds is largely unknown. In this study, we classified differentially managed habitats and calculated their area using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to evaluate suitable habitat availability over the study period (2016-2017 and 2017-2018 wintering periods). We then used social behavioral association network (SBAN) model to compare habitat quality through species-species social interactions and species-habitat associations in lakes with different hydrological management. The results indicated that social interactions between and within species structured wintering waterbirds communities, which could be dominated by one or more species, while dominant species control the activities of other co-existing species. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests indicated significant differences in SBAN metrics between lakes (p = 0.0237) and habitat (p < 0.0001) levels. Specifically, lakes with managed hydrology were preferred by more species. The managed lakes had better habitat quality in terms of significantly higher habitat areas (p < 0.0001) and lower habitat transitions (p = 0.0113). Collectively, our findings suggest that proper hydrological management can provide continuous availability of quality habitats, especially mudflats and shallow waters, for a stable SBAN to ensure a wintering waterbirds community with more sympatric species in a dynamic environment.

J	SPELLING, SM; YOUNG, JO				SPELLING, SM; YOUNG, JO			THE POPULATION-DYNAMICS OF METACERCARIAE OF APATEMON-GRACILIS (TREMATODA, DIGENEA) IN 3 SPECIES OF LAKE-DWELLING LEECHES	PARASITOLOGY												Monthly samples of the leeches Erpobdella octoculata, Glossiphonia complanata and Helobdella stagnalis were taken over a two-year period from an eutrophic. English lake to detect metacercariae of the trematode, Apatemon gracilis. In each cohort of each of the three leeches, prevalence was low in young individuals, rose to a peak in autumn/winter, and then declined until the cohort had almost died out: in E. octoculata and H. stagnalis a final brief increase occurred. Mean intensity and relative density values followed a similar seasonal pattern of change to that of prevalence in these last two species, but in G. complanata values fluctuated irregularly with no distinct pattern. The frequency distribution of the parasite in G. complanata was highly over-dispersed, but less so in the other two species. Infected E. octoculata reached sexual maturity. The parasite reduced egg production in G. complanata and H. stagnalis, but only by maximum values of 2.5 and 9% respectively. This reduction in fecundity is low compared to the subsequent high mortality, at 95% or more, of newly recruited young from as yet unidentified causes. Parasite-related host mortality was difficult to assess in young leeches, but there was some evidence for its occurrence in older leeches of E. octoculata and H. stagnalis. however, this is unlikely to play a prominent role in the control and regulation of lacustrine leech populations.																			0031-1820	1469-8161				DEC	1986	93		3				517	530		10.1017/S0031182000081221	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182000081221													WOS:A1986F194200009
J	Coveney, MF; Wetzel, RG				Coveney, MF; Wetzel, RG			Biomass, production, and specific growth rate of bacterioplankton and coupling to phytoplankton in an oligotrophic lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Production of bacterioplankton and phytoplankton was analyzed in oligotrophic Lawrence Lake, Michigan, over a 2-yr period. Variables examined were temperature, bacterial numbers and biovolumes, bacterial production and specific growth rates (mu), phytoplanktonic biomass and production, and alkaline phosphatase activity. Algal and bacterial production varied similarly on temporal and spatial scales; some differences in vertical patterns were evident during summer stratification. Values for mu ranged from 0.2 d(-1) during winter to 2.6 d(-1) in midsummer. Decreases in specific growth rates of bacteria coincided with the onset of heavy CaCO3 precipitation and with increased alkaline phosphatase activities. mu was close to predicted maximal values during periods of mixing but was depressed in upper layers during summer. Temperature showed significant bivariate rank correlations with all variables. With temperature controlled, mu did not show significant partial correlations with algal chlorophyll or production, consistent with a minor role of dissolved organic carbon from phytoplankton for bacterial growth. Low and high estimates of bacterioplanktonic production over 2 yr exceeded that of phytoplankton by factors of 1.33 and 3.35. Net metabolism in the pelagic zone was heterotrophic, a state likely maintained by littoral macrophytic and periphytic production. Apparent coupling between phyto- and bacterioplankton stemmed mainly from similar responses of each component to common regulating factors rather than from direct metabolic links.																			0024-3590					NOV	1995	40	7					1187	1200		10.4319/lo.1995.40.7.1187	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1995.40.7.1187													WOS:A1995TK46900001
J	Çelekli, A; Öztürk, B				Celekli, Abuzer; Ozturk, Baki			Determination of ecological status and ecological preferences of phytoplankton using multivariate approach in a Mediterranean reservoir	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The European Union Water Framework Directive includes phytoplankton as one of the mandatory five biological indicators to be used to assess the ecological status of surface waters. The objective of the study was determination of ecological status and ecological preferences of phytoplankton from April 2012 to June 2013, using multivariate approach in Alleben Reservoir in the southeast Turkey. The reservoir showed a warm monomictic stratification pattern (stratification in April-October 2012 vs. mixing in November 2012-March 2013). The reservoir was meso-eutrophic according to phosphorus, chlorophyll a, and transparence values. Phytoplankton biovolume reached remarkable peaks in autumn and spring. Phytoplankton species belong to functional groups of A, D, E, J, L-O, L-M, MP, P, and Y as descriptor. Phytoplankton trophic index (PTI) and assemblage index (Q) indicated the overall medium ecological status of Alleben Reservoir. PTI and Q indices may be appropriate phytoplankton metrics to assess the ecological status of the reservoir. Changes in environmental gradients significantly influenced the ecological preferences of species and phytoplankton abundance in the reservoir. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) confirmed that phytoplankton species were sensitive to environmental variability, with the first two axes of CCA able to explain 92.8% of the total variation and 37.1% of the cumulative percentage variance in the phytoplankton assemblage structure. Most effective explanatory factors (e.g., salinity, conductivity, pH, and temperature) played significant role (P = 0.002) in the seasonality of species.					; Çelekli, Abuzer/P-9845-2015	Celekli, Abuzer/0000-0002-2448-4957; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2014	740	1					115	135		10.1007/s10750-014-1948-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-014-1948-8													WOS:000342491300010

Adults and larvae were sampled in activity traps every week during March-October and every 2-3 weeks during November-February. Newly-emerged adults were generally found from mid-July to September, and after overwintering in torpidity, probably in the water, they again appeared in the second half of June to August/September. Laying of eggs took place from early/mid July to early August. Larvae occurred in the traps from late July to early May. I. fenestratus was thus found to be a semivoltine summer breeder, with overwintering larvae the first winter and overwintering adults the next. Both adults and larvae lived in large areas of the lake's littoral zone.																			0165-0424						2002	24	3					199	205		10.1076/aqin.24.3.199.8118	http://dx.doi.org/10.1076/aqin.24.3.199.8118													WOS:000177410900003

The measurements showed extremely high plant height (up to 142 cm) and biomass values (5.2 kg(w.w.) m(-2)), indicating the importance of C. tomentosa for the whole coastal water ecosystem. The apical part of the thallus grew more intensively from early spring to midsummer. The growth rate of the subapical section was very low during the entire observation period. The plant's diurnal net primary production rate peaked in July (43.4 mgO g(d.w.)(-1) 24h(-1)); remarkably lower rates were measured in May and September. The elongation growth and primary production were not correlated with water nutrient concentrations and water temperature. As the active growth of C. tomentosa takes place during a relatively short period at the beginning of summer, the amount of available solar radiation and the temperature levels during this sensitive time can have a significant effect on the community in the same year.

Substance and energy flows formed by the emergence of amphibiotic insects across the water-air boundary on the floodplain lakes of the Volga River	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												Substance flow across the water-air boundary on the floodplain Lake Holodnoe (Saratov oblast) is generally formed by the Culicomorpha (76.1%) and accounts for 0.35 g/m(2) of the lake area per year. The energy flow amounts to 1.87 kcal/m(2), and most of it accounts for the second half of summer and autumn. Annual removal of biogenic elements is 0.18 g/m(2) for carbon, 0.04 g/m(2) for nitrogen, and 0.004 g/m(2) for phosphorus. The greatest contribution to flows of substance and energy is brought by large species of chironomids, as well as chaoborids and medium-sized chironomids, which produce several generations within a year and reach high abundance at a larval stage. Other floodplain lakes of the Volga River with similar biotopical features and species composition of amphibiotic insects are characterized by a quantitatively similar level of exchange processes with adjacent land ecosystems across the water-air boundary.

The Kuqa Basin, located in the northern part of the Tarim Basin in Northwest China, is a saline basin regarded as the most potential potash-seeking area. However, the origin and water circulation processes of saline springs have yet to be fully characterized in this saline basin. In this study, a total of 30 saline spring samples and 11 river water samples were collected from the Qiulitage Structural Belt (QSB) of the Kuqa Basin. They were analyzed for major (K+, Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+, SO42-, Cl- and HCO3-) and trace (Sr2+ and Br-) ion concentrations, stable H-O-Sr isotopes and tritium concentrations in combination with previously published hydrogeochemical and isotopic (H-O) data in the same area. It is found that the water chemical type of saline springs in the study area belonged to the Na-Cl type, and that of river water belonged to the Ca-Mg-HCO3-SO4 type. The total dissolved solid (TDS) of saline springs in the QSB ranged from 117.77 to 314.92 g/L, reaching the brine level. On the basis of the general chemical compositions and the characteristics of the stable H-O-Sr isotopes of saline springs, we infer that those saline springs mainly originated from precipitation following river water recharging. In addition, we found that saline springs were not formed by evapo-concentration because it is unlikely that the high chloride concentration of saline springs resulted in evapo-concentration and high salinity. Therefore, we conclude that saline spring water may have experienced intense evapo-concentration before dissolving the salty minerals or after returning to the surface. The results show that the origin of salinity was mainly dominated by dissolving salty minerals due to the river water and/or precipitation that passed through the halite-rich stratum. Moreover, there are two possible origins of saline springs in the QSB: one is the infiltration of the meteoric water (river water), which then circulates deep into the earth, wherein it dissolves salty minerals, travels along the fault and returns to the surface; another is the mixture of formation water, or the mixture of seawater or marine evaporate sources and its subsequent discharge to the surface under fault conditions. Our findings provide new insight into the possible saltwater circulation and evolution of saline basins in the Tarim Basin.

However, phytoplankton biomass in southern Baltic Sea coastal water bodies (CWB) remains high and the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Therefore, a CWB data set was analysed regarding changes in phytoplankton biomass and nutrient concentration of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from 2000 to 2014. It was expected to find imbalances between produced phytoplankton biomass and total nutrient concentrations. Inner CWB were cyanobacteria-dominated and showed up to five times higher chlorophyll a-concentrations compared to outer CWB with similar total phosphorus-concentrations. Phytoplankton tended to be P-limited during spring and N-limited during summer. Phytoplankton biomass and nutrient concentrations were even higher during very humid years, which indicated a close coupling of the CWB with their catchment areas. This study suggests that re-mesotrophication efforts need to consider the importance of changed phytoplankton composition and nutrient availabilities.

River-lake systems act as natural reservoirs for ARGs and provide an ideal model for studying their regulatory mechanisms. This study employed high-throughput quantitative PCR, high-throughput sequencing, correlation analyses, and model predictions to investigate the dynamics of ARGs and their influencing factors in Liangzi Lake, located in the mid-reaches of the Yangtze River. The research specifically centered on three environmental components: lake water, sediment, and river water. Results indicated that the ARGs from eight major antibiotic classes, displaying distinct seasonal distribution patterns. In comparison to the sediment, the water phase demonstrated a higher diversity of ARGs, with the highest level of ARGs sharing observed between lake and river waters (approximately 83.7 %). Furthermore, seasonal variations significantly influenced the distributions of both ARGs and bacterial communities. The diversity of ARGs was highest during the summer and autumn, and specific bacterial species exhibited robust correlations with ARGs (including matA/mel, aac (6 ')-Ib-03, and blaROB). It is worth noting that environmental attributes and bacterial diversity had the most substantial impact on the dynamic changes in ARGs. Lastly, source tracking analysis pinpointed that sediment as the primary source of ARGs in lake water, constituting 45 % to 48 % of the total ARGs. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of ARGs and their influencing factors in the river-lake system of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, with Liangzi Lake as a representative case.

Occurrence of Dactylogyrus infection linked to seasonal changes and host fish size on four cyprinid fishes in Lake Manyas, Turkey	ACTA ZOOLOGICA ACADEMIAE SCIENTIARUM HUNGARICAE												In this study, dactylogyrid parasites on the gills of four cyprinid fishes (Blicca bjoerkna, Rutilus rutilus, Scardinius etythrophthalmus, Vimba vimba) in Lake Manyas, Turkey, were examined oil the basis of samples taken from on-site surveys carried out between January-1997 and November-1998. The intensity of Dactylogyrus infection was investigated depending on the parasite species, the years and seasons, and host fish size. Four Doctylogyrus species were identified on the gills of host fishes: D. sphyrna on B. bjoerkna, D. crucifer on R. rutilus, D. difformis on S. erythropthalmus, D. cornu on V. vimba. The prevalence and mean intensity of Dactylogyrus infection for each parasite species was determined as follows: D. crucifer (41.5%, 10.65 +/- 5.79 specimens/fish), D. cornu (14.2%, 30.24 +/- 11.30), D. difformis (28.1%, 31.71 +/- 30.95), D. sphyrna (28.7%, 16.76 +/- 16.88). While maximum intensity was recorded for D. difformis, the lowest was for D. crucifer. However, it was not a statistically meaningful difference for all the parasite species. As regards the prevalence of the parasite species depending oil the years, it was observed higher in 1998 than in 1997. Regarding the seasonal changes in the intensity and prevalence level, a very sharp decrease in the intensity levels of the parasite species was determined for the three fish parasites, except D. crucifer, between the late autumn and winter.

The environmental influence was reflected in seasonal differences in the fish assemblages over five main climatic seasons. Diversity estimators indicated that species richness and evenness were greater in the monsoon and autumn as was overall species diversity. Dominance-diversity measures also showed greater richness and evenness of fish species during monsoon and autumn, and overall diversity was reduced concomitantly with increase in species dominance in the later months. From the Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA), it could be concluded that dissolved O-2, CO2, temperature and nutrients were the most significant determinants of species assemblages in these tropical rivers. Fish samples were categorised into seven trophic guilds. The fish community was dominated by planktivores during monsoon and plankti-detrivores in other seasons. Assessments of the conservation status of the available fish species indicated that most species encountered during the monsoon and autumn were threatened. Since these rivers provide important refuge for a number of species due to their shallowness, varied trophic niches and suitability as a reproductive site, this study suggests a community level conservation approach considering the seasonal impacts to integrate with the population specific conservation programmes.

J	Smith, RJ; Moore, FR; May, CA				Smith, Robert J.; Moore, Frank R.; May, Christopher A.			Stopover habitat along the shoreline of northern Lake Huron, Michigan: Emergent aquatic insects as a food resource for spring migrating landbirds	AUK												Recent work in Michigan's eastern Upper Peninsula suggests that terrestrial areas bordering northern Lake Huron provide important stopover habitat for spring migrating landbirds, principally because of the presence of emergent aquatic midges (Diptera: Chironomidae). Migrants were concentrated in lakeshore habitats abundant with midges during spring migration. American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) and Black-throated Green Warblers (Dendroica virens) foraged and used habitat differently, depending on their distance from the lakeshore. Here, we describe results of an integrative study in which we sampled resources, quantified American Redstart foraging behavior, and estimated mass change in American Redstarts and five other common migrant landbird species to evaluate the importance of adult midges as an early season resource for spring migrants. Resource sampling and American Redstart foraging behavior suggested that more food was available in shoreline habitats than inland during spring migration. Furthermore, migrants gained mass in shoreline habitat during stopover, which supports the argument that nearshore areas provide important stopover habitat for spring migrants. Finally, resource sampling, mass change estimates, and American Redstart foraging behavior suggested that midges and spiders (Araneae: Arachniclae) provided an important early season resource for migrating landbirds. Evidence suggests that midges were responsible for elevated spider abundance at the shoreline and that birds foraged on both midges and spiders. Midges appear to play an important role in providing high-quality stopover habitat for landbirds migrating through Michigan's eastern Upper Peninsula.

In the present study, the effect of temporal and spatial changes in salinity on the phytoplankton biovolume, species richness, diversity, and species composition was investigated seasonally in 2020 and 2021 in 6 coastal lagoons of Marmara Basin (Turkiye). In more saline lagoons, phytoplankton biovolume, species richness, diversity, and the total number of species were lower. In lagoons which salinity values were approximate, the species composition was similar. Although the salinity in the lagoons did not show significant change seasonally, biovolume values were lower in Mert lagoon in the fall of 2020 when the salinity values were higher compared to the spring of 2021. Moreover, the considerable decrease in salinity shifted the dominant species structure from high salinity optima species to low salinity optima species in this lagoon. Other effective parameters in the seasonal distribution of dominant species were detected as temperature, dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, and nitrate nitrogen.					; ONGUN SEVİNDİK, Tuğba/JAN-7028-2023; CANLI, OLTAN/JJE-0713-2023; TUNCA, Hatice/GOP-3221-2022; Ergül, Halim/F-5129-2018; , HALIM AYTEKIN/F-5129-2018; GÜZEL, Barış/ONK-1960-2025	Kaya, Mert/0000-0001-8429-842X; Canli, Oltan/0000-0002-2652-844X; GUZEL, Baris/0000-0002-6709-2339; , HALIM AYTEKIN/0000-0002-9313-1426; Tunca, Hatice/0000-0003-3724-5215													0006-3088	1336-9563				MAY	2024	79	5					1251	1266		10.1007/s11756-024-01612-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11756-024-01612-w		FEB 2024											WOS:001161127300002

We show that the facility, which undertakes PCB waste consolidation and maintains a low-yield incinerator for products such as light ballasts, acted as a point source for the spatial distribution of PCBs in vegetation. Concurrent air and vegetation sampling was performed to study the relationship between air-vegetation partitioning and the octanol-air partition coefficient (K-OA). We show evidence of equilibrium partitioning for lower-chlorinated congeners (log K-OA between 7 and 8.5), kinetically limited deposition oil plants for intermediate congeners (log K-OA between 8.5 and 11), and particle-bound deposition for congeners with high log K-OA values (> 11), consistent with the McLachlan partitioning model. From spring to autumn, heavier congeners become much more concentrated in samples farther away from the facility, possibly because of higher temperatures, which enhance dispersal of these congeners. Multivariate principal components analysis showed that PCB composition in vegetation near the emission source most closely resembled the Aroclor mixtures processed by the treatment facility.

A seasonal survey of methane oxidation and CO2 reduction rates indicates that methane production was confined to sulfate-depleted sediments at all times of year, while methane oxidation occurred in two modes. In the summer, methane oxidation was confined to sulfate-depleted sediments and occurred at rates lower than those of CO2 reduction. In the winter, net methane oxidation occurred in an interval at the base of the sulfate-containing zone. Sediment incubation experiments suggest both methanogens and sulfate reducers were responsible for the observed methane oxidation. In one incubation experiment both modes of oxidation were partially inhibited by 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid (a specific inhibitor of methanogens). This evidence, along with the apparent confinement of methane oxidation to sulfate-depleted sediments in the summer, indicates that methanogenic bacteria are involved in methane oxidation. In a second incubation experiment, net methane oxidation was induced by adding sulfate to homogenized methanogenic sediments, suggesting that sulfate reducers also play a role in the process. We hypothesize that methanogens oxidize methane and produce hydrogen via a reversal of CO2 reduction. The hydrogen is efficiently removed and maintained at low concentrations by sulfate reducers. Pore water Hz concentrations in the sediment incubation experiments (while net methane oxidation was occurring) were low enough that methanogenic bacteria could derive sufficient energy for growth from the oxidation of methane. The methanogen-sulfate reducer consortium is consistent not only with the results of this study, but may also be a feasible mechanism for previously documented anaerobic methane oxidation in both freshwater and marine environments.																			0886-6236					DEC	1994	8	4					451	463		10.1029/94GB01800	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/94GB01800													WOS:A1994PU11800005

Long-term reliability of the Figaro TGS 2600 solid-state methane sensor under low-Arctic conditions at Toolik Lake, Alaska	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												The TGS 2600 was the first low-cost solid-state sensor that shows a response to ambient levels of CH4 (e.g., range approximate to 1.8-2.7 mu mol mol(-1)). Here we present an empirical function to correct the TGS 2600 signal for temperature and (absolute) humidity effects and address the long-term reliability of two identical sensors deployed from 2012 to 2018. We assess the performance of the sensors at 30 min resolution and aggregated to weekly medians. Over the entire period the agreement between TGS-derived and reference CH4 mole fractions measured by a high-precision Los Gatos Research instrument was R-2 = 0.42, with better results during summer (R-2 = 0.65 in summer 2012). Using absolute instead of relative humidity for the correction of the TGS 2600 sensor signals reduced the typical deviation from the reference to less than +/- 0.1 mu mol mol(-1) over the full range of temperatures from 41 to 27 degrees C. At weekly resolution the two sensors showed a downward drift of signal voltages indicating that after 10-13 years a TGS 2600 may have reached its end of life. While the true trend in CH4 mole fractions measured by the high-quality reference instrument was 10.1 nmol mol(-1) yr(-1) (2012-2018), part of the downward trend in sensor signal (ca. 40 %-60 %) may be due to the increase in CH4 mole fraction because the sensor voltage decreases with increasing CH4 mole fraction. Weekly median diel cycles tend to agree surprisingly well between the TGS 2600 and reference measurements during the snow-free season, but in winter the agreement is lower. We suggest developing separate functions for deducing CH4 mole fractions from TGS 2600 measurements under cold and warm conditions. We conclude that the TGS 2600 sensor can provide data of research-grade quality if it is adequately calibrated and placed in a suitable environment where cross-sensitivities to gases other than CH4 are of no concern.

In more detail, the structure and function of phytoplankton and the microbial loop in the euphotic layer at the same site were investigated during the late-winter-early-spring period under the ice. The depth of euphotic zone (up to 1% of surface irradiation) was 35 to 40 in. Primary production was measured three times a week with the C-14 method in 2, 10, 20, 30 and 40 in. Maximum production was found in 10 in, with lower values towards the surface (light inhibition) and towards the lower layers. The total production in cells larger than 1 mu m in the column (0-40 m) was 204-240 mg C d(-1) m(-2), 30-40% of it being in cells 1-3 mu m (mostly picocyanobacteria), which represented roughly 9% of the total chlorophyll a (estimated from pigment analyses). A major part of phytoplankton biomass was formed by diatoms (Synedra acus Hust., Asterionella formosa Hass. and Stephanodiscus meyerii Genkal & Popovskaya). Total production (including extracellular, dissolved organic matter) was 235-387 mg C day(-1) m(-2), and the exudates were readily used by bacteria (particles 0.2-1 mu m). This part amounted to 1-5% of cellular production in 2 to 20 in and 11-77% of cellular production in 20-40 in, i.e., in light-limited layers. From 0 to 30 in, chlorophyll a concentration was 0.8 to 1.3 mu g 1(-1), wherefrom it decreased rapidly to 0.1 mu g 1(-1) towards the depth of 40 in. Bacteria (DAPI-stained microscopic counts) reached 0.5-1.4 x 10(6) ml(-1); their cell volumes measured via image analysis were small (average 0.05 mu m(-3)), often not well countable when erythrosine stain was used. Bacterial biomasses were in the range of 6-21 mu g C 1(-1). Numbers of colony forming units (CFUs) on nutrient fish-agar were c. 3-4 orders lower than DAPI counts. The amounts of heterotrophic protists were low, whereby flagellates reached 6 to 87 ml(-1) and ciliates, 0.2-1.2 ml(-1) (mostly Oligotrichida). Bacterial production was measured in the same depths as primary production using H-3-thymidine (Thy) and C-14-leucine (Leu) uptake. Consistently, bacterial abundances, biomasses, thymidine and leucine production were higher by 30-50% in layers 2, 10 and 20 in compared with that in the deeper 30 and 40 m, where cellular primary production was negligible. Leucine uptake in the deeper layers was even three times lower than in the upper ones. From the comparison of primary and bacterial production, bacteria roughly use 20-40% of primary production during 24 h in the layers 2 to 20 in. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

PLANKTON	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The 24 New Zealand lakes studied include the largest and deepest lakes in the country. Of 17 North Island lakes, all but 2 are on the Volcanic Plateau; the 7 South Island lakes all lie in the mountains of Otago and Southland. The phytoplankton of the South Island lakes was not studied. The seasonal variation in genera of phytoplankters in 7 regularly sampled lakes on the Volcanic Plateau, North Island, showed that Melosira was the most abundant genus in all but 1. It reached a maximum in winter, but the next most abundant genus, Dinobryon, had its maximum in summer. Among zooplankters, Boeckella dilatata was present in all the South Island lakes, and Calamoecia lucasi in all but 4 of the North Island lakes; B. propinqua and B. hamata each occurred in 2 North Island lakes. Bosmina meridionalis, the common cladoceran in all lakes, occurred in 22 of the lakes, Ceriodaphnia dubia in 20, but Daphnia carinata in only 8. Discussion of the relative productivity of those lakes sampled frequently is based on mean numbers of cladocerans and copepods and mean volumes of phytoplankton.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1977	11	2					307	340		10.1080/00288330.1977.9515680	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1977.9515680													WOS:A1977EG17900009

To investigate the occurrences of algal blooms in these two different water bodies, we consider the Arabian Gulf (shallow) and the Sea of Oman (deep) as examples for this study. In this work, we have used a recent unique and comprehensive in-situ dataset of the frequent algal blooms collected over the last decade in the Arabian Gulf and Oman Sea. This data includes algal blooms' frequencies as well as seawater properties including sea surface temperature (SST), Dissolved Oxygen (DO), salinity and pH. In addition, we have used satellite SST and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) data, ocean reanalysis data of water currents and bathymetry data. These data have been analyzed through statistical methods including descriptive analysis, trend analysis, and empirical orthogonal function. The results obtained demonstrate a general decreasing trend of the algal bloom events from 2010 to 2018 in the shallow waters while in the deep waters the trend is increasing. We reveal a clear seasonality with the highest frequency and Chl-a concentration of algal blooms during winter and spring. The frequent occurrences of algal blooms during winter is due to favorable SST between 24 degrees C and 32 degrees C in shallow waters and up to 28 degrees C in deep waters. Although salinity differs in the shallow waters (similar to 39 ps mu) and deep waters (similar to 37), but algal blooms are found to be tolerant to these different salinity ranges as well as at pH of 8 in both regions. Chl-a commonly exceeds 10 mg m(-3) in the shallow waters (100 m) and at water currents between 0.1 and 0.2 m/s. And it is less than 10 mg m(-3) in deeper waters (100 m) and at water currents exceeding 0.2 m/s. Even at optimum levels of SST and water depth algal blooms cannot occur if there is insufficient supply of nutrients.

J	Prokopenko, AA; Williams, DF				Prokopenko, AA; Williams, DF			Depleted methane-derived carbon in waters of Lake Baikal, Siberia	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Results of hydrochemical and stable isotope measurements during the ice-breaking period on Lake Baikal indicate an apparent lack of relationship between measured delta C-13 of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and phytoplankton below the trophogenic layer. While planktonic values of -31.7 to -33.5%. are within a typical lacustrine range, the delta C-13 values of DIC turned out to be very negative, from -28.9 to -35.6 parts per thousand.. These isotopic values of DIC appear to be associated with oxidation of methane that accumulated during winter ice cover period. At the time of sampling, however, the observed depletion did not affect the phytoplankton/DIC fractionation relationship, because the difference between phytoplankton and DIC (-20 to -22 parts per thousand. in surface waters) lies within the expected range of the fractionation coefficient. By analogy with small lakes, we explain this lack of relationship by the time lag between peak productivity and peak methane oxidation. Our interpretation of the Baikal DIC isotopic signature is consistent with methanogenesis in bottom sediments and with the known presence of widespread unstable gas hydrates and active methane seeps on the lake floor. Our findings suggest that methane is an important component of the Baikal carbon cycle, that late winter concentrations of methane in Baikal under ice may be 3-4 orders of magnitude higher than previously reported values for summer, and that the lake may be emitting a significant amount of methane to the atmosphere.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG 1	2005	544						279	288		10.1007/s10750-005-0926-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-0926-6													WOS:000231958500023

Specific attention is given to the influence of the vertical distribution of dissolved oxygen (DO) on the DVM of the different larval instars. To our knowledge, this study is the first that combines continuous observations of DVM of C. flavicans with continuous measurements of DO distributions over several months, allowing the assessment of changes in DVM due to the development of hyperoxic conditions in the deep water of lakes. With ontogenetic development, C. flavicans larvae increase their sensitivity to changes in light intensity and their tolerance to low oxygen conditions. Our results suggest that the physiological changes of C. flavicans larvae are adaptations to seasonal changes in DO, improving migration abilities to enable utilization of hypoxic and anoxic waters to avoid predation. Interannual change in the abundance and vertical distribution of phytoplankton affecting DO concentrations was sufficient to alter DVM patterns of C. flavicans larvae between years.					; Hofmann, Hilmar/G-8445-2011	Encinas Fernandez, Jorge Miguel/0000-0002-5916-8989; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				JUL	2018	75	7					1142	1150		10.1139/cjfas-2017-0157	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2017-0157													WOS:000436409500013

The C-14 age of thin pedogenic carbonate laminae indicate four periods of coating formation: the second half of MIS-3 (24.1-23.3 and similar to 34.0-35.0 kyr BP), from the warm phases of the Late Glacial to the Middle Holocene (12.9-4.6 kyr BP) and the final of the Middle Holocene (3.6-3.3 kyr BP). Thus, studied carbonate coatings are mainly relict feature of the previous epochs of pedogenesis and Middle Holocene stage of surface soil formation. Paleoecological conditions reconstructed for the identified stages of formation of carbonate coatings correlate well with the trend of climatic changes in the Baikal region and adjacent areas. They reflect the effect of temperature and moisture fluctuations on the dynamics of soil-forming processes. Distinct delta O-18 and delta C-13 values suggest that the coatings of Transbaikalian steppes and forest-steppes of Fore-Baikal region have been formed under contrast environmental conditions. It is assumed that the formation of pedogenic carbonates in Transbaikalia is mainly confined to the summer season, when the soil is most warmed up, and the plants actively consume water and emit a large amount of CO2 . This agrees well with the slightly higher temperatures of the warm season and the greater aridity of this region. In turn, carbonate precipitation in Fore-Baikal region occurred during the degassing of soil solutions in the course of periodic freezing and thawing, alternation of phases of snowmelt and rainwater infiltration into the soil and its subsequent freezing, which can be observed in the region in spring and autumn. A significant CaCO3 content in the studied soils contributed to the high growth rates of pendants. Holocene coatings are characterized by maximum growth intensity, which correlates with the highest carbonate content in the slope sediments where they are found. At the same time, MIS-3 coatings formed mainly on significantly less carbonate-rich alluvial deposits, which apparently affected their lower growth intensity. Based on an analysis of the growth rates of coatings, comparison of the isotopic composition of different age groups of pendants and soil micromorphology the more humid climatic conditions of the MIS-3 is assumed in comparison with the Middle Holocene. The temperature conditions of pedogenesis may be similar. Both for the Middle Holocene and for the MIS-3 relatively low temperatures of pedogenesis and long-term seasonal soil freezing are supposed.

Hydrological, thermal and chemical influence of an intact rock glacier discharge on mountain stream water	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Rock glaciers are the most prominent permafrost-related mountain landforms. This study investigates the effects of the dis-charge from an intact rock glacier on the hydrological, thermal and chemical dynamics of a high-elevation stream in the NW Italian Alps. Despite draining only 39 % of the watershed area, the rock glacier sourced a disproportionately large amount of discharge to the stream, with the highest relative contribution to the catchment streamflow occurring in late summer -early autumn (up to 63 %). However, ice melt was estimated to be only a minor component to the discharge of the rock glacier, due to its insulating coarse debris mantle. The sedimentological characteristics and internal hydrological system of the rock glacier played a major role in its capability to store and transmit relevant amounts of groundwater, es-pecially during the baseflow periods. Besides the hydrological influence, the cold and solute-enriched discharge from the rock glacier significantly lowered the stream water temperature (especially during warm atmospheric periods) as well as increased the concentrations of most solutes in the stream. Furthermore, in the two lobes forming the rock glacier, different internal hydrological systems and flowpaths, likely driven by different permafrost and ice content, caused contrasting hy-drological and chemical behaviours. Indeed, higher hydrological contributions and significant seasonal trends in solute con-centrations were found in the lobe with higher permafrost and ice content. Our results highlight the relevance of rock glaciers as water resources, despite the minor ice melt contribution, also suggesting their potential, increasing hydrological importance in the light of climate warming.					salerno, franco/ABD-3319-2020; Colombo, Nicola/J-9426-2016; Crosta, Giovanni/AAA-8798-2020; Caschetto, Mariachiara/ABB-9434-2020; Filho, Elso/G-4608-2012	CASCHETTO, MARIACHIARA/0000-0001-7343-9426; Rossini, Micol/0000-0002-6052-3140; Bearzot, Francesca/0000-0001-5375-9932													0048-9697	1879-1026				JUN 10	2023	876								162777	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162777	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162777		MAR 2023						36906009					WOS:000957599300001

Quantitative characterization of the nutrition of the free-living horse (Equus caballus) on Vodnyi Island (Manych-Gudilo Lake)	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												The nutritional value of plant fodder, daily consumption, and digestibility of forage were assessed in an isolated group of free-living (wild) horses inhabiting the pastures of Vodnyi Island during different seasons of 2010-2011. The digestibility was determined by the proportion between inert food components (silicon, lignin) in the diet and the feces. The daily intake of food was calculated according to the weight of the daily feces and digestibility of food. Daily food consumption of the free-living horses during the snowless period is from 8 to 14 kg/ind. and 16 kg/ind. (dry weight) during the winter period. Food digestibility changes from 49 to 54% per year; the mean digestibility is 52%. The daily metabolic energy intake during the snowy period of the year (130.7 MJ/ind.) is almost twofold higher than in spring (67.4 MJ/ind.). In all the seasons, it exceeds the requirements for energy. The free-living horses of Vodnyi Island have parameters of digestibility and consumption of forage similar to other horses.																			1062-3590	1026-3470				DEC	2013	40	8					684	691		10.1134/S1062359013080086	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1062359013080086													WOS:000327206900005

In this study, the relationship amongst the phytoplankton species composition and abiotic environmental factors on seasonal changes in the community composition of free-living and attached bacteria in Lake Erhai were studied. Using Illumina high-throughput sequencing, we found that the impact of environmental factors on both the free-living and attached bacterial community composition was greater than that of the phytoplankton community, amongst which total phosphorus, Secchi disk, water temperature, dissolved oxygen and conductivity strongly influenced bacterial community composition. Microcystis blooms associated with subdominant Psephonema occurred during the summer and autumn, and Fragilaria, Melosira and Mougeotia were found at high densities in the other seasons. Only small numbers of algal species-specific bacteria, including Xanthomonadaceae (Proteobacteria) and Alcaligenaceae (Betaproteobacteria), were tightly coupled to Microcystis and Psephonema during Microcystis blooms. Redundancy analysis showed that although the composition of the bacterial communities was controlled by species composition mediated by changes in phytoplankton communities and abiotic environmental factors, the impact of the abiotic environment on both free-living and attached bacterial community compositions were greater than the impact of the phytoplankton community. These results suggest that the species composition of both free-living and attached bacterial communities are affected by abiotic environmental factors, even when under strong control by biotic factors, particularly dominant genera of Microcystis and Psephonema during algal blooms.

The maximum growth rates at 3.degree. C of these populations varied from 0.1-0.4 doublings d-1. The growth rates of the 2 diatoms were about twice as high as the growth rates of Oscillatoria. Different temperature and light intensity conditions used during the experiment often had different effect on the degree of nutrient growth limitation for Oscillatoria.

In this study, we examined the complex factors determining the development of phytoplankton communities during the vegetative growth season in eutrophic lakes located in a temperate zone in eastern Poland. Our analysis enabled us to divide the data into two different periods: years with a cold winter and low total precipitation, and those with a mild winter and high total precipitation. The analysis showed that the soluble and total nitrogen content, concentration of chlorophyll a, total phytoplankton biomass, and biomasses of Cyanobacteria and Cryptophyceae were significantly higher in the vegetative growth season in the year after a mild winter, whereas the soluble and total phosphorus content and phytoplankton biodiversity were significantly lower in these years. Hence, climate warming indirectly led to the loss of biodiversity in the phytoplankton communities in the studied lakes of temperate zone. During this study, we also tested the effects of increases in air temperature and total precipitation on phytoplankton communities over short time periods (14 and 28 days). The results showed that the total phytoplankton biomass and the chlorophyll a concentration were only positively correlated with the air temperature. All of the features described in this study showed how sensitive lake ecosystems are to climatic fluctuations.

DISTRIBUTION IN NORTHWEST ENGLAND	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												The northern limit of the natural distribution of T. cordata in Britain is the English Lake District (latitude 54.degree. 30''N). Many populations contain very old trees and in all but 3 of 150 localities there was no regeneration from seed for at least a century. Seeds produced are largely infertile. Trees commonly grow in rocky situations which were probably never entirely cleared by man. Most localities are between sea-level and 160 m, sometimes on level ground but usually on slopes with aspects between 45.degree. and 315.degree.. Populations occur on all the main rock-types and on soils ranging from acid rankers and brown podzolic soils to rendzinas. The climate of the region is characterized by mild winters and cool summers with mean daily maxima of air temperature for July and Aug. not exceeding 19.degree.

The lakes can be divided into 2 groups: the low conductivity slightly alkaline lakes Naivasha, Oloidien and the Winam Gulf of Lake Victoria; and the high conductivity, highly alkaline-saline lakes Nakuru, Elmenteita and Bogoria. The former 3 show a qualitatively rich, typical warmwater rotifer association dominated by Brachionids and Filinia. The saline soda lakes are dominated by several populations of Brachionus dimidiatus, which can reach enormous numbers. The taxonomy and biometry of this species was subjected to statistical analysis. Some interesting and rare species are described: Anuraeopsis coelata, Lepadella triptera f. deconincki, Trichocerca gracilis and T. mus.

JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Sunlight can oxidize dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in freshwaters. The importance of complete photooxidation, or photomineralization, as a sink for DOC remains unclear in temperate rivers, as most estimates are restricted to lakes, high latitude rivers, and coastal river plumes. In this study, we construct a model representing over 75,000 river reaches in the Connecticut River Watershed (CRW), USA, to calculate spectrally resolved photomineralization. We test the hypothesis that photomineralization is a negligible DOC sink across all reaches and flow conditions relative to DOC fluxes. Our model quantifies reaction rates and transport drivers within the river reaches for the ranges of flow conditions, incoming solar irradiance, and canopy cover shading observed throughout the year. Our model predicts average daily areal photomineralization rates ranging from 1.16 mg-C m(-2) day(-1) in low flow river reaches in the winter, to 18.33 mg-C m(-2) day(-1) in high flow river reaches during the summer. Even for high photomineralization fluxes, corresponding photomineralization uptake velocities are typically at least an order of magnitude smaller than those reported for other instream processes. We calculate DOC elimination by photomineralization relative to DOC fluxes through individual stream reaches as well as the entire riverine portion of the CRW. We find that relative photomineralization fluxes are highest in summer drought conditions in low order streams. In median flows and mean light intensities, for an average watershed travel distance, 3%-5% of the DOC fluxes are eliminated, indicating that photomineralization is a minor DOC sink in temperate rivers.

J	Liu, WC; Chen, WB; Kimura, N				Liu, Wen-Cheng; Chen, Wei-Bo; Kimura, Nobuaki			Impact of phosphorus load reduction on water quality in a stratified reservoir-eutrophication modeling study	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Monitoring data collected from the Mingder Reservoir in Taiwan indicate that the water quality is between mesotrophic and eutrophic. Chlorophyll a concentration is higher in the summer and anoxic conditions occur in the bottom. The data also reveal that a pronounced vertical thermal gradient in summer and vertical mixing the end of fall. A vertical two-dimensional, laterally averaged hydrodynamic and water quality model (CE-QUAL-W2) was adopted to simulate the water surface elevation, water temperature, and water quality conditions in the water column. The modeling effort was supported with monitoring data collected in the field for a 2-year period in the reservoir. The hydrodynamic model reproduced the time series water surface elevation. Spatial and temporal distributions of temperature in the water column of the reservoir were also well reproduced by the hydrodynamic model. Model-calculated concentrations of key water quality constituents such as nutrients, dissolved oxygen, and algal biomass matched the measured values closely in the reservoir. The calibrated model was then applied to simulate water quality response to various nutrient reduction scenarios. Results of the model scenario runs reveal that a 20% and 80% reduction of the phosphorus loads will improve the water quality from eutrophic to mesotrophic and oligotrophic conditions, respectively. The modeling effort has yielded valuable information that can be used by decision makers for the evaluation of different management strategies of reducing watershed nutrient loads.					; Kimura, Nobuaki/AAP-4316-2020; Chen, Wei-Bo/ISU-9054-2023; Liu, Wen-Cheng/ABG-4271-2020	Chen, Wei-Bo/0000-0003-2487-4127; KIMURA, NOBUAKI/0000-0001-7399-987X; 													0167-6369					DEC	2009	159	1-4					393	406		10.1007/s10661-008-0637-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-008-0637-3								19043791					WOS:000271530400030

Synoptic-scale to mesoscale atmospheric circulation connects fluvial and coastal gravel conveyors and directional deposition of coastal landforms in the Dead Sea basin	EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS												Streams convey coarse-clastic sediments towards coasts, where interactions with deltaic and coastal processes determine their resultant sedimentology and geomorphology. Extracting hydroclimatic signals from such environments is a desired goal, and therefore studies commonly rely on interpreting available paleoclimatic proxy data, but the direct linking of depositional and geomorphic processes with the hydroclimate remains obscure. This is a consequence of the challenge of linking processes that are often studied separately and span across large spatial and temporal scales, including synoptic-scale hydroclimatic forcing, streamflows, water body hydrodynamics, fluvial and coastal sediment transport, and sedimentation. Here, we explore this chain of connected processes in the unique setting of the Dead Sea basin, where present-day hydroclimatology is closely tied with geomorphic evolution and sediment transport of streams and coasts that rapidly respond to lake-level fall. We use a 5-year (2018-2022) rich dataset of (i) high-resolution synoptic-scale circulation patterns, (ii) continuous wind-wave and rain-flood records, and (iii) storm-scale fluvial and coastal sediment transport of "smart" and marked boulders. We show the significance of Mediterranean cyclones in the concurrent activation of fluvial (floods) and coastal (wind waves) sediment conveyors. These synoptic-scale patterns drive the westerlies necessary for (i) delivering the moisture across the Judean desert, which is transformed into floods, and at the same time, (ii) the coeval, topographically funneled winds that turn into surface southerlies (>10 m s(-1)) along the Dead Sea rift valley. During winter, these mesoscale southerlies generate 10-30 high-amplitude, northward-propagating storm waves, with <4 m wave heights. Such waves transport cobbles for hundreds of meters alongshore, northward and away from the supplying channel mouths. Four to nine times per winter the rainfall generated by these atmospheric patterns is capable of generating floods that reach the stream mouths, delivering poorly sorted, coarse gravel. This usually occurs during the decay of the associated storm waves. This gravel is dispersed alongshore by waves during subsequent storms. As storm waves dominate and are >5 times more frequent than flash floods, coarse-clastic beach berms and fan deltas are deposited preferentially north of the delivering channel mouths. This asymmetric depositional architecture, controlled by the regional hydroclimatology, is identified for both the modern and late Pleistocene coast and delta environments, implying that the dominance of present-day Mediterranean cyclones also persisted in the region during the late Pleistocene when Lake Lisan occupied the basin.					; Armon, Moshe/GWQ-4177-2022; Lensky‬‏, Nadav/AAL-7950-2021; Enzel, Yehouda/AAV-5829-2021	Eyal, Haggai/0000-0001-5704-9292; Enzel, Yehouda/0000-0001-8367-9255													2196-6311	2196-632X				JUL 6	2023	11	4					547	574		10.5194/esurf-11-547-2023	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/esurf-11-547-2023													WOS:001024170900001
J	Hurwitz, S; Lowenstern, JB; Heasler, H				Hurwitz, Shaul; Lowenstern, Jacob B.; Heasler, Henry			Spatial and temporal geochemical trends in the hydrothermal system of Yellowstone National Park: Inferences from river solute fluxes	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												We present and analyze a chemical dataset that includes the concentrations and fluxes of HCO3-, SO42-, Cl-, and F- in the major rivers draining Yellowstone National Park (YNP) for the 2002-2004 water years (I October 2001-30 September 2004). The total (molar)flux in all rivers decreases in the following order, HCO3-> Cl-> SO42-> F-, but each river is characterized by a distinct chemical composition, implying large-scale spatial heterogeneity in the inputs of the various solutes. The data also display non-uniform temporal trends; whereas solute concentrations and fluxes are nearly constant during base-flow conditions, concentrations decrease, solute fluxes increase, and HCO3-/Cl-, and SO42-/Cl- increase during the late-spring high-flow period. HCO3-/SO42- decreases with increasing discharge in the Madison and Falls Rivers, but increases with discharge in the Yellowstone and Snake Rivers. The non-linear relations between solute concentrations and river discharge and the change in anion ratios associated with spring runoff are explained by mixing between two components: (1) a component that is discharged during base-flow conditions and (2) a component associated with snow-melt runoff characterized by higher HCO3-/Cl- and SO42-/Cl-. The fraction of the second component is greater in the Yellowstone and Snake Rivers, which host lakes in their drainage basins and where a large fraction of the solute flux follows thaw of ice cover in the spring months. Although the total river HCO3- flux is larger than the flux of other solutes (HCO3-/Cl-approximate to 3), the CO2 equivalent flux is only similar to 1% of the estimated emission of magmatic CO2 soil emissions from Yellowstone. No anomalous solute flux in response to perturbations in the hydrothermal system was observed, possibly because gage locations are too distant from areas of disturbance, or because of the relatively low sampling frequency. In order to detect changes in river hydrothermal solute fluxes, sampling at higher frequencies with better spatial coverage would be required. Our analysis also suggests that it might be more feasible to detect large-scale heating or cooling of the hydrothermal system by tracking changes in gas and steam flux than by tracking changes in river solute flux.

A case study from Ireland	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												This paper compares, for the first time, nutrient levels and chlorophyll a measured in a set of seasonal lakes with those reported for permanent lakes in the literature. Twenty-two turloughs (karstic seasonal lakes) in western Ireland were sampled monthly from the onset of flooding (October) until they dried out (6 to 9 months). The turloughs showed similar levels of nutrients and chlorophyll a to those reported for Irish and international lakes. Chlorophyll a peaked between November and February in the majority of turloughs, sometimes with values higher than those measured in mesotrophic lakes in summer. A significant log-linear regression was found between total phosphorus and chlorophyll a, which suggests P limitation of algal biomass in the majority of the turloughs. The regression characteristics were not significantly different than those described in similar studies of permanent lakes. Patterns in seasonal variation of nutrients are also presented, their underlying causes being discussed in relation to their transport within catchments. Our results show that despite being predominantly winter phenomena, turloughs can be as productive as permanent lakes.

Meanwhile, the construction of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) has reallocated the annual discharge, likely affecting the transportation of carbon in its various forms. The transport and transformation of carbon in Changjiang River and the effect of the TGR were discussed based on three field campaigns, a 1year time series investigation, and historical data. Our results indicated the following: (1) Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) was derived from the upper stream and was significantly diluted downstream by the low-DIC waters from two large lakes. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was a product of anthropogenic input and showed no clear relationship with discharge. particulate organic carbon (POC) within total suspended matter (POC%) was below the global average. (2) The TGR has not measurably affected the transport of DOC downstream of the reservoir dam. However, downstream grain size has decreased and autochthonous processes have increased, resulting in a sharp increase in POC% since reservoir construction. (3) For the period 1997-2010, estimated annual DIC flux was 16.9Tgyr-1. The regulation of river flow by the TGR has decreased the river DIC flux to the East China Sea in the autumn and increased it in the spring. Furthermore, the South-North Water Diversion will reduce the high-DIC water from the upper reach, thus affecting the biogeochemistry of the Changjiang estuary and the ecosystem of the nearby coastal ocean.

J	Mckay, NP; Kaufman, DS				McKay, Nicholas P.; Kaufman, Darrell S.			Holocene climate and glacier variability at Hallet and Greyling Lakes, Chugach Mountains, south-central Alaska	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Evidence from lake sediments and glacier forefields from two hydrologically isolated lake basins is used to reconstruct Holocene glacier and climate history at Hallet and Greyling Lakes in the central Chugach Mountains of south-central Alaska. Glacial landform mapping, lichenometry, and equilibrium-line altitude reconstructions, along with changes in sedimentary biogenic-silica content, bulk density, and grain-size distribution indicate a dynamic history of Holocene climate variability. The evidence suggests a warm early Holocene from 10 to 6 ka, followed by the onset of Neoglaciation in the two drainage basins, beginning between 4.5 and 4.0 ka. During the past 2 ka, the glacial landforms and lacustrine sediments from the two valleys record a remarkably similar history of glaciation, with two primary advances, one during the first millennium AD, from similar to 500 to 800 AD, and the second during the Little Ice Age (LIA) from similar to 1400 to 1900 AD. During the LIA, the reconstructed equilibrium-line altitude in the region was no more than 83 +/- A 44 m (n = 21) lower than the modern, which is based on the extent of glaciers during 1978. Differences between the summer temperature inferred from the biogenic-silica content and the evidence for glacial advances and retreats suggest a period of increased winter precipitation from 1300 to 1500 AD, and reduced winter precipitation from 1800 to 1900 AD, likely associated with variability in the strength of the Aleutian Low.

At present, the freeze-thaw processes is the key to distinguishing spring algal blooms in mid- to high-latitude lakes from low-latitude lakes. Based on the visualization and an analysis of the literature in the WOS database during 2007-2023, we clarified the driving mechanism of the freeze-thaw process (freeze-thaw, freeze-up, and thawing) on spring algal bloom in lakes by describing the evolution of the freeze-thaw processes on the nutrient migration and transformation, water temperature, lake transparency and dissolved oxygen, and physiological characteristics of algae between shallow lakes and deep lakes. We found that the complex phosphorus transformation process during the frozen period can better explain the spring-algal-bloom phenomenon compared to nitrogen. The dominant species of lake algae also undergo transformation during the freeze-thaw process. On this basis, the response mechanism of spring algal blooms in lakes to future climate change has been sorted out. The general framework of "principles analysis, model construction, simulation and prediction, assessment and management" and the prevention strategy for dealing with spring algal bloom in lakes have been proposed, for which we would like to provide scientific support and reference for the comprehensive prevention and control of spring algal bloom in lakes under the freezing and thawing processes.					ma, yinghui/GVT-7442-2022; Wu, Yanfeng/I-5630-2017; dai, chang/KRQ-0436-2024; Liu, Xuemei/HSG-6255-2023	Zhao, ziyue/0009-0000-4878-4682; Wu, Yanfeng/0000-0001-9441-8499; 														2073-4441				JAN	2024	16	2							257	10.3390/w16020257	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16020257													WOS:001150865500001

The tufa is composed of relatively pure barite with <= 0.34 wt% Ca2+ and <= 0.77 wt% Sr2+. The mound is made up of coated bubble, raft, undulatory sheet, stromatolitic, coated grain and detrital conglomerate barite tufa. Although previously unreported in barite, these lithotypes are akin to facies found in many carbonate spring deposits. Raft and ooid-coated grain tufa was formed via 'inorganic' barite precipitation in spring water ponds and tributaries where rapid oxidation of sulphide to sulphate established barite supersaturation. Undulatory sheet tufa may have formed by the reaction of dissolved barium with sulphate derived from the oxidation of extracellular polysaccharide-rich colloidal sulphur films floating in oxygenated, barite-saturated spring water ponds. Coated bubble, oncoid-coated grain and stromatolitic tufa with filamentous microfossils was formed in close association with sulphur-tolerant microbes inhabiting dysoxic and oxygenated spring water tributaries and ponds. Adsorption of dissolved barium to microbial extracellular polysaccharide probably facilitated the development of these 'biogenic' lithotypes. Detrital conglomerate tufa was formed by barite cementation of microdetrital tufa, allochthonous lithoclasts and organic detritus, including caribou hair. Biogenic textures, organic artefacts and microfossils in the Flybye barite tufa have survived diagenetic aggradational recrystallization and precipitation of secondary cements, indicating the potential for palaeoecological information to be preserved in barite in the geological record. Similarities between the Flybye barite tufa and carbonate spring deposits demonstrate that analogous textures can develop in chemical sedimentary systems with distinct mineralogy, biology and physiochemistry.

Microcystins, potent hepatotoxins, represent the most frequent toxins produced by cyanobacteria. The determination of the microcystins' profile in waterbodies is important for determining the real toxic potential. We have investigated the evolution of the microcystins' profile of Lake Garda (Italy) from both a qualitative and a quantitative point of view over a period of five years. We have also analysed possible correlations between toxin profile and selected environmental parameters. We found that a demethylated microcystin variant (RRdm) was always dominant but showing a cyclic trend, alternating periods in which it represented the only variant, and periods in which other variants were present (LRdm, HtyrRdm, RR, and LR). These changes are probably due to changes in chemotypes composition inside the resident Planktothrix rubescens population and do not seem to be exclusively linked to the considered environmental variables. Total microcystin concentrations were always low (in the ng L-1 scale), and showed typical peaks in the metalimnetic layer during summer-autumn time of each year.					cerasino, leonardo/G-8466-2011; Cerasino, Leonardo/G-8466-2011; Boscaini, Alberto/I-7538-2019; Salmaso, Nico/O-8968-2015	cerasino, leonardo/0000-0002-0839-9832; 													0275-7540	1029-0370				MAY 27	2016	32	5					492	506		10.1080/02757540.2016.1157175	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02757540.2016.1157175													WOS:000372732100007

Some parameters (chlorophyll-a, CODMn, TP, TN, petroleum, F-, and As) showed seasonal variations, with higher levels in summer and/or autumn due to higher temperatures, more intense human activity during the tourist season, and surface runoff during the rainy season. However, the levels of K+, Hg, and Cr6+ were not impacted by temperature and human activities, showing only slight seasonal variations. The lake water chemistry was mainly controlled by evaporation. The high concentrations of CODMn, TP, TN, and F- are mainly a result of the release of pollutants from sediment, intense evaporation, human activities, the input of Yellow River water, and surface runoff. The simulation results showed that TN increased from 8.61E-05 to 1.06E-04 mol/L, and TP increased from 1.49E-06 to 2.20E-06 mol/L due to the recharge of the Yellow River. Evaporation caused an increase in TP, TN, and F from 1.49E-06, 8.61E-05, and 4.76E-05 mol/L to 2.71E-06, 1.57E-04, and 8.66E-05 mol/L, respectively. This study provides a scientific basis for the sustainable management of Lake Sha and similar inland dry lakes.

It contains abundant saline spring resources and abnormal trace element enrichments. The hydrochemical molar ratios (Na/Cl, B/Cl, and Br/Cl), H-O isotopes, and B isotopes of the saline spring were systematically measured to describe the evolution of brines and the origin of the boron. The sodium chloride coefficient of the water samples in this area is around 1.0 or slightly greater, which is characteristic of leached brines; the highest B/Cl value is 4.25 (greater than that of seawater). The Na/Cl, B/Cl, and Br/Cl values of the springs are clear indicators of a crustal origin. The delta O-18 values of the spring waters range from -12.88 parts per thousand to -16.05 parts per thousand, and the delta D values range from -100.91 parts per thousand to -132.98 parts per thousand. Meanwhile the B content and B isotopes in the saline springs are in the ranges of 1.00 to 575.56 ppm and +3.55 parts per thousand to + 29.59 parts per thousand, respectively. It has been proven that the saline springs in the Nangqen Basin are a type of leached brine, suggesting that the saline springs have a terrestrial origin. The delta B-11-B characteristics of the springs are similar to those observed in the Tibetan geothermal area, indicating that these two places have the same B source. Moreover, they have a crustal origin (marine carbonate rocks and volcanic rocks) instead of a deep mantle source.

Historical dendroarchaeology of two log structures in the Valles Caldera National Preserve, New Mexico, USA	DENDROCHRONOLOGIA												We used dendroarchaeological techniques to determine the year of construction of two historic structures in the Valles Caldera National Preserve of New Mexico, USA. Historical documents date some structures in the headquarters area of the Preserve, but the Commissary Cabin and Salt Barn were lacking conclusive construction dates. Both structures were originally thought to have been built by the Otero family who bought the property in 1899. We found that the structures were built from two tree species, white fir (Abies concolor (Gordon) Lindl. ex Hildebr.) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), surprising given that ponderosa pines are also found in great numbers in the adjacent forest. Tree rings from 20 logs were confidently crossdated both graphically and statistically and provided cutting dates of trees in both structures of 1940 and 1941 when compared against the Fenton Lake reference chronology (Commissary Cabin: r = 0.69, t = 15.54, p < 0.0001, n = 263 years; Salt Barn: r = 0.77, t = 11.7, p < 0.0001, n = 232 years). By combining the cutting date years and terminal ring attributes, we suggest that both structures were built in the spring or early summer of 1941 using freshly cut logs and logs that had been cut the previous spring (1940, before or during the growing season) and stockpiled. The cutting dates of 1940 and 1941 indicate that these buildings were constructed during the Franklin Bond (1939-1945) era and associated with the transition from sheep ranching to more modern cattle grazing. These new dates provide a more distinct understanding of the cultural resources at the Valles Caldera National Preserve and provide interpretative staff with more accurate information that can be given to the public.

J	Schöll-Barna, G				Schoell-Barna, Gabriella			An isotope mass balance model for the correlation of freshwater bivalve shell (Unio pictorum) carbonate δ18O to climatic conditions and water δ18O in Lake Balaton (Hungary)	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The oxygen isotope composition of bivalve shells (delta O-18(shell)) can potentially record environmental variability of shallow lakes and therefore it has been extensively used as a proxy in the reconstruction of past climate and environmental conditions. As delta O-18(shell) reflects - besides the water temperature - the oxygen isotope composition of lake water (delta O-18(L)), it is required to interpret the quality and impact of parameters influencing the delta O-18(L). Using the isotope mass balance model. I tested the hypothesis that Balaton lake water delta O-18 variability can be described as a result of the combined effects of three main climatic parameters such as river runoff precipitation and evaporation. 1 calculated delta O-18(L) time series for the period 1999-2008 for the whole water body at Siofok (eastern part of Lake Balaton, Hungary) based on measured precipitation, inflow and evaporation amount and measured inflow, precipitation delta O-18 and calculated vapour delta O-18 data. The comparison of the modelled delta O-18(L) time series to measured surface delta O-18(L) data revealed that delta O-18 of Balaton water is sensitive for variation of climatic parameters. This variability is most striking at the surface, while according to the results of the model, the whole water body itself is less sensitive. Monthly differences suggest that generally during summer the whole water body is mixed up, while moderate isotope stratification (0.3-0.7 parts per thousand difference between surface and whole water body) can be assumed in early spring and autumn. Predictions of shell 6180 values were made using the measured surface water delta O-18 data and the modelled delta O-18 values for the whole water body. High-resolution sampling was conducted on two Unio pictorum shells covering the period of 2001-2008, and both predictions were compared to measured shell delta O-18 records. The results showed that the prediction for the whole water body gives a better fit to the measured shell delta O-18, suggesting that the whole water body better describes the isotope variability of shell carbonate. As a practical application of the isotope mass balance model was used to present the effect of precipitation and evaporation on delta O-18(shell). The relationship between intra-shell delta O-18-variability and precipitation amount (precipitation/evaporation ratio) were determined, which allows the quantified prediction the impact of meteorological parameters affecting the oxygen isotope composition of shell carbonate.																			1129-5767	1723-8633					2011	70	2					272	282		10.3274/JL11-70-2-15	http://dx.doi.org/10.3274/JL11-70-2-15													WOS:000294320400013
J	Höfle, MG; Haas, H; Dominik, K				Höfle, MG; Haas, H; Dominik, K			Seasonal dynamics of bacterioplankton community structure in a eutrophic lake as determined by 5S rRNA analysis	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Community structure of bacterioplankton was studied during the major growth season for phytoplankton (April to October) in the epilimnion of a temperate eutrophic lake (Lake Plusssee, northern Germany) by using comparative 5S rRNA analysis. Estimates of the relative abundances of single taxonomic groups were made on the basis of the amounts of single 5S rRNA bands obtained after high-resolution electrophoresis of RNA directly from the bacterioplankton. Full-sequence analysis of single environmental 5S rRNAs enabled the identification of single taxonomic groups of bacteria. Comparison of partial 5S rRNA sequences allowed the detection of changes of single taxa over time. Overall, the whole bacterioplankton community showed two to eight abundant (>4% of the total 5S rRNA) taxa. A distinctive seasonal succession was observed in the taxonomic structure of this pelagic community. A rather-stable community structure, with seven to eight different taxonomic units, was observed beginning in April during the spring phytoplankton bloom. A strong reduction in this diversity occurred at the beginning of the clear-water phase (early May), when only two to four abundant taxa were observed, with one taxon dominating (up to 72% of the total 5S rRNA). The community structure during summer stagnation (June and July) was characterized by frequent changes of different dominating taxa. During late summer, a dinoflagellate bloom (Ceratium hirudinella) occurred, with Comamonas acidovorans (beta-subclass of the class Proteobacteria) becoming the dominant bacterial species (average abundance of 43% of the total 5S rRNA). Finally, the seasonal dynamics of the community structure of bacterioplankton were compared with the abundances of other major groups of the aquatic food web, such as phyto- and zooplankton, revealing that strong grazing pressure by zooplankton can reduce microbial diversity substantially in pelagic environments.																			0099-2240					JUL	1999	65	7					3164	3174											10388718					WOS:000081199000051
J	Bacon, CR; Lanphere, MA; Champion, DE				Bacon, CR; Lanphere, MA; Champion, DE			Late Quaternary slip rate and seismic hazards of the West Klamath Lake fault zone near Crater Lake, Oregon Cascades	GEOLOGY												Crater Lake caldera is at the north end of the Klamath graben, where this N10 degrees W-trending major Basin and Range structure impinges upon the north-south-trending High Cascades volcanic are. East-facing normal faults, typically 10-15 km long, form the West Klamath Lake fault zone, which bounds the graben on its west side. The fault zone terminates on the south near the epicentral area of the September 1993 Klamath Falls earthquakes. It continues north past Crater Lake as the Annie Spring fault, which is within similar to 1 km of the west caldera rim, and Red Cone Spring fault. We have determined a long-term vertical slip rate of 0.3 mm/yr for these two faults using high-precision K-Ar and 40Ar/39Ar age measurements on offset lava flows ranging in age from ca. 35 to 300 ka. Holocene offset reported by Hawkins et al. and epicenters of eight M-W 2 earthquakes in 1994 and 1995 indicate that the West Klamath Lake fault zone is active. Empirical relations between earthquake magnitudes and scarp heights or fault lengths suggest that the fault zone is capable of producing earthquakes as large as M-W 7 1/4. Earthquakes on these or other faults of the zone could trigger landslides and rockfalls from the walls of the caldera, possibly resulting in large waves on Crater Lake.																			0091-7613	1943-2682				JAN	1999	27	1					43	46		10.1130/0091-7613(1999)027<0043:LQSRAS>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0091-7613(1999)027<0043:LQSRAS>2.3.CO;2													WOS:000077932300011

It is the most important wintering site in the world for the white-headed duck Oxyura leucocephala, a globally threatened species. It has also held internationally important numbers of 10 other waterbird species. The lake is threatened by the construction of an industrial complex and airport on the northern shore. Falling water levels (from construction of upstream dams), sedimentation (from catchment erosion), organic pollution (from food processing and sewage) and inorganic effluent (from a sulphur mine) represent long-term threats to the lake system. Illegal hunting from the shore has a serious impact upon white-headed ducks, which concentrate close inshore and show little escape response in the presence of hunters. White-headed duck numbers have fluctuated considerably since 1967 with a peak (incomplete) count of 10,927 in February 1991. By January 1995, numbers had declined to 2805. Numbers of black-necked grebe Podiceps nigricollis, white-fronted goose Anser albifrons and tufted duck Aythya fuligula have declined. Numbers of large gulls of the Larus argentatus group which prey upon white-headed duck have increased, possibly due to pollution. For 10 of 16 waterbird species regularly observed at the site, highest numbers were recorded before 1974. Recommendations for the conservation of the lake are presented.

These anthropogenic ecosystems have been previously identified as potential gateways for exotic ostracods to colonize nearby wetlands. In this work, we compared the rice field ostracod composition with a shallow lake in a protected Mediterranean wetland (Albufera N2000 site, Eastern Iberian Peninsula). We found 37 ostracod species, 13 of which were considered exotic. Rice fields harbored the highest number of both native and exotic ostracod taxa (16 and 12 species, respectively). Our hypothesis that exotic species were more abundant during summer while native species dominated the community in winter was confirmed by the analysis of temporal changes along the rice field cycle. Comparing the ostracod composition of rice fields with that of the littoral and central parts of the hypertrophic Lake Albufera showed a clear differentiation according to a spatially constrained cluster analysis, with the richest ostracod community corresponding to the rice fields and the lowest species richness to the center of the lake, where vegetation was scarce. Finally, we suggest some criteria for considering an ostracod species as native or exotic when its origin is unknown and discuss the potential origin of the exotic species found, the pathways they might have used to arrive and establish in new areas, and the biological traits that may facilitate the spread of ostracods over new areas after their arrival.

These transfer functions showed good performance parameters and were subsequently applied to the previously published diatom record from lake Chalco, southern Basin of Mexico. Heinrich stadials (HS-3 to HS-0) were reconstructed as cold and dry events, with HS-2 representing the coldest and driest conditions, while HS-1 shows a complex bimodal cooling pattern. Orbital scale variability is also recorded. High and variable lake salinities from similar to 34 to 29 ka BP (marine isotope stage 3, MIS-3) corresponded with times of maximum summer insolation and evidences of frequent fires. MIS-2 was identified as a cold period, with low lake salinity associated with low evaporation, with two cold intervals during the minima in spring (similar to 25.5 ka BP) and summer (similar to 20 ka BP) insolation. The similar to 20 ka BP cold event together with HS-2 (24-23 ka BP), defined a bimodal maximum cooling during the last glacial maximum (LGM: 24.5-19.5 ka BP) within the range of pollen-based estimates, further supporting a maximum tropical cooling of 4-5 degrees C for the LGM. The deglacial (19.5-11.5 ka BP) showed the highest precipitation anomalies with three peaks that closely correlated with glacier advances in the nearby mountains (Iztaccihuatl). The early Holocene marked a change towards high lake salinities and the highest positive temperature anomalies (+3.5 degrees C) during a peak in summer insolation. Even though at orbital scale Chalco showed a nearly opposite trend to the record from the more southerly lake Peten-Itza (Guatemala), at millennial scale it showed a common pattern of cold and dry conditions during HSs, comparable to other tropical latitude sites in the northern hemisphere and further supporting the idea that there is a strong coupling between tropical and higher latitudes climates, in particular with the North Atlantic.

Influenza virus types change antigenically throughout the years, but the appearance of either influenza A or B has occurred with almost yearly frequency, especially during late winter or early spring. These outbreaks result in sharp rises in ARD [acute respiratory disease] rates, have had little effect on pneumonia incidence. Adenovirus is associated with ARD and sometimes appears to be involved with pneumonia. Beta hemoly-i ic Group A Streptococci outbreaks also appears to cause elevated ARD rates. Both the isolation of these bacterial agents and ARD incidence is lowered by mass pencillin prophylaxis. Agents such as rhino-virus and Mycoplasma also contribute toward the over-all ARD and pneumonia incidence.																									1965	55	1					38	46		10.2105/AJPH.55.1.38	http://dx.doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.55.1.38								14246106					WOS:A1965CAX2900009

Current Trends in Climate Change in Yakutia	GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES												The spatial distribution patterns of climatic changes in Yakutia are considered. For 26 meteorological stations of Yakutia we calculated the linear trend coefficients of climatic characteristics: air temperature (mean annual, January and July temperatures) and the mean annual amount of atmospheric precipitation from 1966 to 2016. Maps of climate change trends were compiled from linear trend coefficients. A spatial analysis of the zonal (regional) peculiarities of the climate of Yakutia has been carried out. An increase in air temperature was established for the 50-year period under consideration. It was found that the annual values of the air temperature trend are positive and, on average, a characteristic trend change interval is 0.3 to 0.6 A degrees C/10 yr. Most of the meteorological stations recorded trends of air temperature with maximum values in winter and minimum values in summer. It was determined that the values of the trends in annual precipitation show different directions, and positive trends occur on more than 70% of the territory of Yakutia. Their maximum corresponds to the mountain-taiga regions of Southern Yakutia. Negative trends in precipitation with values of up to-15 mm/10 yr. are observed in tundra landscapes. The findings show that different regions of Yakutia respond differently to climate change. The trend of an increase in mean annual temperature is largely due to the rise in temperatures during the winter months. The rise in air temperature in Yakutia may be part of global warming. Over the last 50 years there has been an increase in the amount of precipitation in Yakutia as a whole.

In the euphotic zone, maximum ETS-activity (81.65 mg C m-2-h-1) and 14-C uptake (88.75 mg C m-2 h-1) were observed during the spring period. Minimum ETS-activity (19.84 mg C m-2 h-1) and 14-C uptake (17 mg C m-2 h-1) were recorded during the autumn season. Nanoplankton fraction (< 35 .mu.m) contributed 45 to 96% (average 73%) of the total community respiration. Of the 3 fractions studied, the < 10 .mu.m fraction contributed about 29-78% (average 56%) of the total respiration. The < 250 - > 35 .mu.m size fractions of phytoplankton contributed only 3-60% (average 27%) of the total respiration of the phytoplankton community. It appears that autotrophic organisms of < 20 .mu.m range are accountable for most of the respiration. These size range organisms also shared most of the C assimilation rates as well as biomass (both as particulate C and chlorophylla). In terms of primary productivity, biomass and respiration (ETS-activity) nanoplankton were the most important primary producers in this mesotrophic Baltic lake (Schoehsee).																			0003-9136						1984	102	2					239	253																WOS:A1984TZ08900008

The regional and seasonal patterns of nutrient limitation of phytoplankton were clearly related to the amounts of N-deposition and N-inputs the lakes received. In areas of low N-deposition in northern Sweden, N-limitation of phytoplankton was evident throughout the summer season due to high catchment N-retention and very low dissolved inorganic N (DIN) inputs during the early summer. High N-deposition in the south was accompanied by high lake DIN-concentrations during the early summer and subsequent P-limitation of phytoplankton. However, P-limitation did not persist over the summer and, as a consequence of a declining DIN-pool, the lakes switched to dual- and co-limitation by N and P, and then to N-limitation. Generally, the lakes were N-limited rather than P-limited during the summer. We conclude that N-limitation is probably a natural state of the unproductive lakes studied, but P-limitation of variable intensity and duration has been induced by elevated atmospheric N-deposition.																			1864-7790	1864-7782					2008	4	1					55	64		10.3354/ab00099	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ab00099													WOS:000262027800007

An Aerial Grid-Based Sampling Method to Estimate Nonbreeding Duck Abundance	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												Probability-based sampling designs for aerial surveys are useful for estimating wintering waterfowl abundances in large areas with contiguous habitat (e.g., Mississippi Alluvial Valley). The effectiveness of these approaches for estimating abundance of nonbreeding waterfowl in small areas with discontinuous habitat has rarely been assessed. Surveys conducted within riverine areas introduce sampling design difficulties because of discontinuous bottomland habitat and irregularity of flooding events. Therefore, we implemented and evaluated a generalizable grid-based, stratified random sampling design to estimate weekly duck abundance within the Wabash River floodplain in southeastern Illinois and southwestern Indiana, USA, during midwinter and early spring 2012 and 2013. We used aerial and ground-based counts to generate abundance estimates and evaluate within-week variation of counts. Peak duck abundance totaled 279,717 (SE = 69,101) in 2012 and 742,027 (SE = 296,563) in 2013. Dabbling ducks were the most abundant duck guild detected and abundance estimates for this group met our precision goal (CV <= 0.25) in 4 of 18 surveys ((x) over bar =0.33, range = 0.20-0.51). We compared the grid-based approach with a traditional aerial inventory and found that estimates from the grid-based approach were on average 75,175 (SE = 46,768) greater than inventory counts.

J	Evans, DM; Day, KR				Evans, DM; Day, KR			Hunting disturbance on a large shallow lake: the effectiveness of waterfowl refuges	IBIS												Disturbance is most likely to have an impact during those periods of the annual cycle when food is scarce and birds have difficulty in meeting their energy requirements. The provision of disturbance-free refuges has been shown to enhance the abundance and diversity of waterfowl wintering on such sites. Lough Neagh, a large shallow lake in Northern Ireland, hosts internationally important numbers of wintering waterfowl, the most numerous being. Common Pochard Aythya ferina, Tufted Duck A. fuligula, Greater Scaup A. marila and Common Goldeneye Bucephala clangula. Hunting is the predominant winter recreational activity. A small number of refuges have been provided to limit the effects of shooting disturbance on the wintering populations. The use of one of these refuges (Doss Bay) was studied during the winter of 1997/8 and compared with a non-refuge site (Brockish Bay) during, the winter of 1998/9. Shooting intensity was greater at weekends than midweek, and significantly more birds used the refuge at weekends than midweek during the shooting season In contrast, significantly fewer birds were observed in Brockish Bay at weekends. This trend ceased when the shooting season closed, suggesting that the effect was due to shooting disturbance. Furthermore, significantly fewer birds used Doss Bay after the shooting season had closed, whereas significantly more birds were observed at Brockish Bay. Shooting disturbance had the greatest impact on dabbling duck species and rails at both sites. Diving ducks moved away from shoreline disturbance to shallow areas where they could still feed. The value of shoreline refuges for waterfowl populations on lakes is discussed.

NUTRITION, PLANT SECONDARY COMPOUNDS AND FOOD LIMITATION	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												(1) We studied the population dynamics and protein nutrition of snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) in the Kluane Lake region, Yukon [Canda] from 1977 to 1986. Plant secondary compounds in winter food plants were monitored from ether (resin) and methanol (phenolic) extracts. (2) Extracts of phenols and resins in concentrations normally found in natural food decreased protein digestibility of processed rabbit food by 40-80% in laboratory experiments. Extracts at half normal concentration did not affect digestibility of protein compared to controls. (3) Digestibility of dry matter of winter food plants was 40% in the more preferred species and 20% in less preferred species. (4) Faecal protein from wild hares was used as an index of mean food quality consumed by hares. Faecal protein was lower in winter than summer. In the winters of peak numbers (1978-82), some animals obtained food of a quality lower than necessary to maintain body weight, indicating food limitation. (5) On the food-supplemented experimental areas, protein indicated there was adequate food in all years except 1980. Since the hare population declined in these areas in 1982 in the presence of adequate food, we conclude that food limitation was not a necessary cause of the decline on the scale of these experiments. (6) Plant secondary compounds declined through the increase, peak and decline phases of the hare cycle. Phenols increased 2 years after hare numbers dropped due to new growth of juvenile shoots. These results are contrary to the hypothesis that fluctuations in secondary compounds cause the hare cycle. (7) The proportion of juvenile twigs in the available food, containing high amounts of secondary compounds, remained low during the decline and first year of low hare density. This is contrary to the plant structure hypothesis which predicts that juvenile twigs should be predominant in the decline and first 2-3 years of the low phase. (8) We suggest that predation is a necessary cause of the hare cycle and in some circumstances, it may be the only cause. The hare cycle is constant in period but variable in amplitude. Food limitation may occur as a consequence of high amplitude rather than a cause of it. (9) It remains to be tested whether predation can act alone or synergistically with food limitation on a larger scale.

J	Elliot, M; Neall, V; Wallace, C				Elliot, M; Neall, V; Wallace, C			A Late Quaternary pollen record from Lake Tangonge, far northern New Zealand	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												Vegetation and climate changes during the Last Glacial through to the late Holocene are identified by pollen analysis of a core from Lake Tangonge in far northern New Zealand. During the earliest part of the record (> 50 ka), regional vegetation was dominated by podocarp-hardwood forest. The most important tall podocarp trees were Dacrydium cupressinum and Dacryearpus dacrydioides. Knightia and Metrosideros sp. were common, and angiosperm elements dominated lowland/coastal forests. The cool, moist climates, of what may be equated to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 4, were followed by a much wetter and slightly warmer period during MIS 3b (59-43 ka) when Ascarina became more abundant along with Dacrycarpus dacrydioides, Metrosideros sp., Quintinia and Syzygium maire. From ca. 43 to 24 ka (MIS 3a) Agathis australis -dominated, mixed, conifer-hardwood forest expanded and hardy podocarps, Podocarpus and Prumnopitys taxifiblia, became more abundant. Ascarina lucida was scarce. Climates characterised by drier summers and cooler winters became increasingly colder, drier and windier, particularly from ca. 30 ka. Replacement of Agathis australis-podocarp-hardwood forest with Fuscospora-podocarp-hardwood forest followed rapidly, and by the Last Glacial Maximum Northland forests as far north as ca. 35 degrees S were dominated by Fuscospora. Bog vegetation burned frequently. Regional temperatures may have been depressed by as much as 3-3.5 degrees C below those of today, and rainfall was probably reduced by about two-thirds. Warm, moist elements expanded in the late glacial as the glacial-type flora became increasingly restricted. Changes in forest composition progressed even more rapidly from the onset of the Holocene. Across the far northern region, Fuscospora -dominated podocarp hardwood forest was rapidly replaced by Agathis australis-podocarp-hardwood forest. Fuscospora declined sharply and Dacrydium cupressinum dominated regional forests. Hardy podocarps became less common than previously, and Ascarina reached its greatest abundance between ca. 10 and 7.6 ka. The early Holocene climate was probably the warmest and most equable for the past 100 ka and temperatures in the Kaitaia region may have been 1-2 degrees C warmer than present. The mid-to-late Holocene (5-2 ka) is characterised by the decline of Ascarina, and the increased abundance of Manoao colensoi, Podocarpus and Prumnopitys taxifolia. Climates were probably slightly cooler and drier during this time as a more seasonal, dry summer/wet, cool winter regime prevailed. Increased cyclonic activity is suggested during this time.

J	Jehl, JR Jr				Jehl, JR Jr			Gadwall biology in a hypersaline environment: Is high productivity offset by postbreeding mortality?	WATERBIRDS												The highly herbivorous Gadwall (Anas strepera) is the most salt-tolerant of the North America dabbling ducks and typically breeds in wetlands where salinity does not exceed 15 parts per thousand.. Small numbers also breed at hypersaline (80-90 parts per thousand) Mono Lake, California, which lacks vascular plants. There, Gadwall raise young on the open lake, feed nearly exclusively on alkali flies (Ephydra hians), and minimize osmotic challenges by concentrating activities in areas with access to fresh water. Fledging success is high as a result of abundant food and low predation, but is evidently offset by poor survivorship among postbreeding adults. Failure to complete wing molt and, perhaps, foot disease are implicated. Food in the lake remains abundant well into the autumn. Nevertheless, local birds leave as soon as the young fledge. Many move to nearby freshwater lakes before eventually before continuing to wintering locations in the Central Valley of California. Migrants avoid Mono Lake at this season in favor of nearby freshwater lakes. Overall, Mono Lake's value for breeding and migrating ducks is low, because of harsh water chemistry, limited fresh water for drinking and marshes for feeding, and apparent low survival among adults.																			1524-4695	1938-5390				SEP	2005	28	3					335	343		10.1675/1524-4695(2005)028[0335:GBIAHE]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/1524-4695(2005)028[0335:GBIAHE]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000232329700010
C	Kitazawa, D; Kumagai, M			ASME	Kitazawa, Daisuke; Kumagai, Michio			NUMERICAL STUDY ON THE EFFECTS OF WATER SURFACE SHIELD AND OXYGEN INJECTION ON WATER QUALITY IN LAKE BIWA	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 27TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON OFFSHORE MECHANICS AND ARCTIC ENGINEERING - 2008, VOL 3					27th International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering	JUN 15-20, 2008	Estoril, PORTUGAL	ASME, Ocean, Offshore, & Arct Engn Div				Numerical simulation was carried out by means of a three-dimensional hydrostatic and ecosystem coupled model in order to predict the effects of water surface shield and oxygen injection on the water quality in Lake Biwa. Recent observations show the degradation of water quality particularly around the water bottom in Lake Biwa. One of the possible reasons of the degradation is the depletion in the vertical mixing of waters due to climate change. The meteorological observations at Hikone show that the atmospheric temperature has increased by 1 degrees C in the recent 20 years. If the vertical mixing of waters is weakened, the waters with rich oxygen are not supplied enough around the water bottom during winter seasons, and the concentration of dissolved oxygen is hardly recovered to the saturated level. The depletion in the vertical mixing of waters has been increasingly worried since Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2007) reported that the globally mean atmospheric temperature will increase by a few degrees C in a century. In order to cope with such problems, the present study proposes a feasible system to inject the oxygen produced by the electrolysis of water. In the proposed system, water surface is shielded by a floating platform, which blocks off the penetration of solar radiation through the water surface and generates the density-driven current due to the horizontal difference in water temperature. In addition, solar cell modules are installed on the floating platform to produce oxygen by means of the electrolysis of water. The produced oxygen is then released from the electrodes installed around the water bottom. As a result of numerical simulation using the three-dimensional hydrostatic and ecosystem coupled model, the effect of water surface shield was negligible since the surface area of the floating platform was quite smaller than that of Lake Biwa. The effect of oxygen injection was remarkable and localized in summer than in winter. The concentration of dissolved oxygen was then expected to increase by more than 0.2mg/l within 15m from the bottom surface in summer, in the cases when 730,000m(3) of oxygen was injected in an year. The effect of seasonal change in the production of oxygen was negligible since little difference was found in the concentration of dissolved oxygen. As future studies, the nested grid system should be utilized to predict precisely the diffusion of oxygen both in the vicinity of the electrode and in the whole Lake Biwa.																					978-0-7918-4820-3				2008							813	820																WOS:000263579600091
J	García-Chicote, J; Armengol, X; Rojo, C				Garcia-Chicote, Jara; Armengol, Xavier; Rojo, Carmen			Zooplankton abundance: A neglected key element in the evaluation of reservoir water quality	LIMNOLOGICA												Based on our results, we propose the use of zooplankton abundance (density or biomass) as an indicator to complement the information currently being used concerning the quality of water in reservoirs. Until now, the Water Framework Directive (EU) for lakes and reservoirs has not included zooplankton because the classification of the water trophic state is based on a bottom-up model: an increase in nutrients implies an increase in primary producers and, therefore, poorer water quality. The use of zooplankton has recently been claimed due to their sensitivity to environmental changes and their control over primary producers. From our work, carried out from 2006 to 2009 (summer and winter seasons) in 20 reservoirs found in various Mediterranean river basins, we prove the relationship of the abundance of zooplankton with the trophic state. Zooplankton abundance, with or without interaction with other agents, explained much of the distribution of total phosphorus in the reservoirs, thus relating the trophic status with the aquatic food chain. In addition, we have found, illustrated by the zooplankton: phytoplankton ratio, how the top-down control masked high production situations in the system. Zooplankton's ability to cover up these cases of poor water quality highlight that the indicators presently being used are frequently insufficient.

Plio-Pleistocene climatic transition and the lifting of the Teton Range, Wyoming	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Fine-grained lacustrine, riverine and ash-fall sediments of the Shooting Iron Formation, whose late Pliocene age is established by Blancan gastropods and vertebrates, yield a pollen flora that is essentially similar in composition to the modern pollen rain in the Jackson Hole area. The Pliocene assemblage suggests a climate like that of the Jackson valley and foothills today. These spectra also resemble a Pliocene pollen flora from Yellowstone Park dated at similar to 2.02 Ma. However, the underlying Miocene Teewinot sediments differ by containing pollen of four exotic deciduous hardwoods (Tertiary relicts) that Suggest a summer-moist climate, unlike that of today. The Shooting Iron sediments lie with an angular unconformity on and above the Miocene lake sediments of the Teewinot Formation. Both of these deposits probably preceded the main uplift of the Teton Range based on the absence of Precambrian clasts in the Tertiary valley deposits. Because the Pliocene floras were modern in aspect, a Plio-Pleistocene transition Would be floristically imperceptible here. The sequence denotes a protracted period of relative stability of climate during Teewinot time, and a shift in vegetational state (summer-wet trees drop out) sometime between the latest Miocene and latest Pliocene. The Pliocene spectra Suggest a dry, cooler climate toward the end of Shooting Iron time. (c) 2006 University of Washington.

J	Mathlouthi, M; Lebdi, F				Mathlouthi, Majid; Lebdi, Fethi			Statistical analysis of dry events in a northern Tunisian basin	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES												A comparative statistical study of dry events during the rainy season is presented. In particular, we carried out statistical processing of the daily records of raingauges in the downstream basin of Lake Ichkeul, in the north of Tunisia. The climate is characterized by a rainy season lasting from the autumn until spring. The Poisson distribution was applied to describe the number of rainfall events, and negative binomial distribution was applied for the length of the dry events, in the rainy season. Since rainfall events are shorter, their duration follows a geometrical distribution, as theoretically required. For planning purposes, the longest seasonal dry spells associated with the various statistical recurrence periods are derived on the basis of the fitted GEV functions. A hydrological year starts at the beginning of the first rainfall event of a given season. The length of hydrological year is determined by the time interval between the start dates of two subsequent rainy seasons. The beginning of the hydrological year occurs on average toward mid-September, but the probability of it occurring before 15 September exceeds 40%. Spatial analysis of dry events is also done. A significant fraction of the dry events occurred for at least two stations simultaneously. Furthermore, 4.5% of the dry events have been observed at all three stations. The analysis of the dry events gives an alternative method to examine the dry spell phenomenon.																			0262-6667					JUN	2009	54	3					442	455		10.1623/hysj.54.3.442	http://dx.doi.org/10.1623/hysj.54.3.442													WOS:000267265600003

In this study, we conducted a precipitation manipulation experiment to investigate the changes in water-use patterns of two coexisting species (Achnatherum splendens and Allium tanguticum) to alterations in soil water content (SWC) resulting from increased and decreased rainfall treatments. The results showed that the leaf water potential (Psi) of A. splendens and A. tanguticum responded to changes in shallow and middle SWC at both the control and treatment plots. However, A. splendens proportionally extracted water from the shallow soil layer (0-10cm) when it was available but shifted to absorbing deep soil water (30-60 cm) during drought. By contrast, the A. tanguticum did not differ significantly in uptake depth between treatment and control plots but entirely depended on water from shallow soil layers. The flexible water-use patterns of A. splendens may be a key factor facilitating its dominance and it better acclimates the recent climate change in the alpine grassland community around Qinghai Lake.

Electronic archival tags provide first glimpse of bathythermal habitat use by free-ranging adult lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Information on lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) depth and thermal habitat use during non-spawning periods is unavailable due to the difficulty of observing lake sturgeon away from shallow water spawning sites. In 2002 and 2003, lake sturgeon captured in commercial trap nets near Sarnia, Ontario were implanted with archival tags and released back into southern Lake Huron. Five of the 40 tagged individuals were recaptured and were at large for 32, 57, 286, 301, and 880 days. Temperatures and depths recorded by archival tags ranged from 0 to 23.5 oC and 0.1 to 42.4 m, respectively. For the three lake sturgeon that were at large for over 200 days, temperatures occupied emulated seasonal fluctuations. Two of these fish occupied deeper waters during winter than summer while the other occupied similar depths during non-spawning periods. This study provides important insight into depth and thermal habitat use of lake sturgeon throughout the calendar year along with exploring the feasibility of using archival tags to obtain important physical habitat attributes during non-spawning periods.

Sensitivity of stratospheric ozone to the latitude, season, and halogen content of a contemporary explosive volcanic eruption	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												We present a systematic evaluation of the perturbation to the stratosphere from an explosive volcanic eruption injecting sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, as a function of latitude, season, and injection gas halogen content in a chemistry-climate state representative of the present day (modeled as year 2025). Enhancements in aerosol surface area density and decreases in stratospheric ozone are observed for a period of years following all modeled scenarios, with volcanic eruptions near the equator impacting both hemispheres relatively equally, and eruptions at higher latitudes reducing the thickness of the ozone layer more substantially in the hemisphere of the eruption. Our simulations reveal that there that are significant seasonal differences when comparing the stratospheric impact of a volcanic eruption occurring in summer versus winter, and this holds true regardless of whether volcanic halogen gases (Cl, Br) are co-injected with sulfur dioxide. If an explosive halogen-rich eruption were to occur, there would be substantial ozone losses in both hemispheres, regardless of latitude or season, with recovery potentially exceeding 4 years.

It was estimated that between 1100 and 1650 m(3) x 10(6) of ice volume was lost during this time period. The median value of 1375 m(3) x 10(6) was converted to a water equivalence value of approximately 1170 m(3) x 10(6) by assuming a glacier ice (including firn and voids) / water ratio of approximately 85%. The bulk glacier wastage estimate was divided into proportions using the Peyto Glacier mass balance record. Unfortunately, the record began in 1966 and a back-cast to 1952 was necessary. Banff maximum summer temperature and Lake Louise snow course data were used as surrogates for summer and winter glacier mass balance, respectively. Seasonal wastage contributions to river flow were estimated for 1967 to 1974 using modelled values of glacial melt (ice and firn only) generated for Peyto Creek by Young (1982). An estimate of the temporal variation of glacier recession inputs to the Bow River hydrograph at Banff was facilitated by comparing known basin yields with the modelled wastage values. For 1952 to 1993, the average annual wastage/basin yield ratio is found to be around 2.3%. For the extremely low flow year of 1970 this ratio increases to 12.5%. The proportion of flow derived from glacier recession in August of this year is estimated to be around 53%. It is thought that the mass balance back-cast may slightly under-estimate wastage values in the early part of the time series, therefore, leading to an over-estimation later on.																									1997							91	102																WOS:000083552000010

We investigated the effect of sediment resuspension on benthic fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), metals (Fe, Mn), and nutrients (N, P) in three drinking water reservoirs using sediment core incubations. Measurement of Fe and Mn fluxes, and of microbial potentials to degrade organic substrates (Biolog EcoPlates T) were employed to understand mechanisms regulating DOC exchange after sediment resuspension. Single sediment resuspension events resulted in DOC fluxes [-104 (into sediment) to 46 (release) mmol m(-2) event(-1)] equal to 9-17 days of diffusive fluxes, making them a relevant process. Shallow reservoir sites were more likely to immobilize DOC after resuspension than deep sites. Sediment resuspension under anoxia always led to increases of DOC and metals in the overlying water. Resuspension did not necessarily mobilize nitrate or phosphorus even under anoxia, while ammonium was released after resuspension. Sediment resuspension increased hypolimnetic microbial potentials to utilize organic substrates in both spring and summer. However microbial cells counts and biomass either remained constant or decreased in summer. Adsorption to Fe minerals seemed to play a role in DOC immobilization as evidenced by a decrease in DOC: Fe molar ratios after resuspension in Fe limited sites and constant ratios in Fe rich sites. The results demonstrate a potential for DOC immobilization mainly by Fe minerals and to some extent by benthic microbes. Therefore, sediment resuspension can be beneficial for water quality in low nutrient, iron rich systems.

J	KORACIN, D; ENGER, L				KORACIN, D; ENGER, L			A NUMERICAL STUDY OF BOUNDARY-LAYER DYNAMICS IN A MOUNTAIN VALLEY .2. OBSERVED AND SIMULATED CHARACTERISTICS OF ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY AND LOCAL FLOWS	BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY												The characteristics of dynamics and thermodynamics of the atmospheric boundary layer in a part of the Colorado River Valley, centered around Lake Mohave, have been investigated by analysis of measurements conducted during a field program in late spring and early summer of 1986 and a series of numerical simulations by a three-dimensional second-moment turbulence-closure model. The model was validated against measurements described in a companion article (Enger et al., 1993). According to airsonde measurements performed on eight nights, the depth of the surface inversion was around 200 m with an average temperature gradient of about 30 K km-1. Analysis of acoustic sounder data collected during one month revealed significant diurnal variations of U and V wind-speed components related to slope and valley flows, respectively. Some of the dynamics properties have been explained by the simulation results. It has been shown that the appearance of supergeostrophic southerly valley flow is associated with the westerly component of the geostrophic flow. Since a westerly component of the geostrophic wind is quite common for this area in summer, this effect also explains the frequently observed southerly valley flow in summer. Elevated minima of the measured wind speed around valley ridges appear to be related to the interaction of conservation of momentum in the X and Y directions. The critical direction of the geostrophic wind relevant for reversal of up-valley flow to down-valley flow has also been studied. The critical direction is about 300-degrees for one of the measurement sites and, depending on the angle between valley axis and south-north direction, the critical direction is expected to vary by about 15-20-degrees. The scale analysis of the simulated equations of motion and turbulence kinetic energy emphasizes the strong impact of meandering of the flow due to actual topographic complexity.

Artificial light supplement could potentially be a useful method to help speeding up recovery. In this study, three common species of submerged macrophytes, Vallisneria natans, Myriophyllum spicatum and Ceratophyllum demersum, were exposed to three LED light treatments (blue, red and white) and shaded (control) for 100 days (from 10 November 2016 to 18 January 2017) in 12 tanks holding 800 L of water. All the three LED light treatments promoted growth of the three macrophyte species in terms of shoot number, length and dry mass. The three light treatments differed in their effects on the growth of the plants; generally, the red light had the strongest promoting effects, followed by blue and white. The differences in light effects may be caused by the different photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of the lights, as indicated by an observed relationship of PPFD with the growth variables. The three species also responded differently to the light treatments, V. natans and C. demersum showing higher growth than M. spicatum. Our findings demonstrate that artificial light supplement in the low-growth winter season can promote growth and recovery of submerged macrophytes and hence potentially enhance their competitiveness against phytoplankton in the following spring. More studies, however, are needed to elucidate if LED light treatment is a potential restoration method in small lakes, when the growth of submerged macrophytes are delayed following a sufficiently large external nutrient loading reduction for a shift to a clear macrophyte state to have a potential to occur. Our results may also be of relevance when elucidating the role of artificial light from cities on the ecosystem functioning of lakes in urban areas.

J	MACEINA, MJ; ISELY, JJ				MACEINA, MJ; ISELY, JJ			FACTORS AFFECTING GROWTH OF AN INITIAL LARGEMOUTH BASS YEAR CLASS IN A NEW TEXAS RESERVOIR	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Highly variable and bimodal length-frequency distributions were observed from an initial young-of-the-year largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) year class in Aquilla Lake, a newly impounded reservoir. Spawning distribution, from daily age determination, indicated that early hatched fish in the cohort tended to be larger fish by late summer-early fall. Age accounted for 46% and 43% of the bass length variation in August and October, respectively. By October, lower growth rates were observed for late hatched fish than for older, earlier hatched fish. A paucity of suitable size prey available to the smaller individuals in the cohort probably accounted for differential growth rates. All these factors appeared to contribute to large variation in length for this year class. Recruitment to adult harvestable size is more likely to be achieved by earlier hatched, faster growing age-0 largemouth bass.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				DEC	1986	3	4					485	492		10.1080/02705060.1986.9665141	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1986.9665141													WOS:A1986F353500006

In this study, high-resolution beryllium isotope and major element records from the annually laminated sediments of maar lake Xiaolongwan-a small, hydrologically closed basin with homogeneous lithology in northeastern China-offer new insights into East Asian climate variability. Abrupt increases in Al/Mg, Ca/Mg, and Ti/Mg ratios indicate intensified aeolian dust input at the onset of the B & oslash;lling-Aller & oslash;d interstadial and the Early-Mid Holocene, synchronous with enhanced East Asian summer monsoon precipitation. Combined with previous dust provenance analyses, we infer a seasonal pattern of dust transport from the Central Asian deserts by southwesterly winds in spring to early summer, prior to peak monsoon rainfall. The 10Be/9Be record exhibits sharp declines that correspond closely to the timing of Dansgaard-Oeschger and Bond events in the North Atlantic. Spectral analysis reveals similar to 1700-yr periodicity in the 10Be/9Be record, consistent with millennial-scale variability observed in the North Atlantic. These findings highlight a persistent climate teleconnection between East Asia and the North Atlantic and demonstrate that coupled dust and hydroclimate signals in maar lake sediments can reliably track sub-orbital climate variability .

Habitat Use and Potential Impacts of the Invasive Silurus glanis L. in a Deep, Large, and Oligotrophic Lake (Lake Maggiore, North Italy)	WATER												The ecological features of invasive alien species are crucial for their effective management. However, they are often lacking in newly invaded ecosystems. This is the case of the European catfish Silurus glanis L. in Lake Maggiore, where the species is present since 1990, but no scientific information is available on its ecology. To start filling this knowledge gap, 236 catfish (67 cm to 150 cm of total length) were collected, measured, and dissected for stomach content analyses from three localities and in two habitats (littoral vs. pelagic) in late autumn/early winter. The NPUE and BPUE (individuals (N) and biomass (B, in grams) per unit effort (m(2)), respectively) of catfish were generally higher in littoral (NPUE > 0.01; BPUE > 96) than in pelagic habitats (NPUE < 0.009; BPUE < 114), but the catfish had, on average, larger sizes in pelagic habitats. Overall, 581 individual prey items were recorded, belonging to 12 taxa. Pelagic catfish specialized their diet exclusively on three prey fish (coregonids, shad, and roach), whilst the diet of littoral catfish was more variable and dominated by crayfish, perch, and roach. These results highlighted for the first time the interaction of larger catfish with the lake's pelagic food web, and thus possible consequences are discussed, including the potential contrasting role S. glanis may have for the lake's fishery.					; De Santis, Vanessa/GPS-8098-2022	VOLTA, Pietro/0000-0003-3177-0473; De Santis, Vanessa/0000-0001-5419-9850; 														2073-4441				SEP	2021	13	18							2549	10.3390/w13182549	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13182549													WOS:000700186900001

To redress this gap we sampled bimonthly at seven sites along the length of the river over 12 months. Rotifers were the dominant zooplankton in the Waikato River making up 85% of the total densities. Cladocerans represented 9% and copepods only 6%. Rotifers were also the most taxonomically rich group with 41 species in 20 genera identified throughout the study. Thirty rotifer species and nine genera represent new records for the river - two cladoceran species were also recorded for the first time. The highest densities of crustaceans and rotifers were found in the hydro lakes. Densities of crustaceans decreased with increasing distance downstream and densities of rotifers were on average 15 times greater than crustaceans in the lower river. The seasonality of Crustacea was similar to that in New Zealand lakes and rivers with high densities in summer and minimum densities over the winter period. Total rotifer densities showed a similar trend although there were marked seasonal differences between individual species.

J	Rautio, M; Korhola, A				Rautio, M; Korhola, A			UV-induced pigmentation in subarctic Daphnia	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The distribution of the plank-tonic crustacean Daphnia and the occurrence of ultraviolet (UV)-protective melanin pigmentation in its body wall were studied in relation to the UV transparency in subarctic ponds and lakes in Finnish Lapland. In shallow ponds, Daphnia only occurred in those with sufficient amounts of UV-screening dissolved organic matter. The highest pigment concentration was found in these Daphnia and in populations that occurred in lakes with low organic carbon content (<2 mg L-1). Pigment synthesis was extremely low during the long winter and peaked immediately after the ice break-up at the time of the maximum underwater UV intensity. We propose that the predicted increase in UV irradiance from ozone depletion in the Northern Hemisphere spring, along with the earlier ice break-up associated with Arctic warming may favor the survival of those organisms with the ability to produce UV photoprotective pigments.

Quantifying ice cliff evolution with multi-temporal point clouds on the debris-covered Khumbu Glacier, Nepal	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Measurements of glacier ice cliff evolution are sparse, but where they do exist, they indicate that such areas of exposed ice contribute a disproportionate amount of melt to the glacier ablation budget. We used Structure from Motion photogrammetry with Multi-View Stereo to derive 3-D point clouds for nine ice cliffs on Khumbu Glacier, Nepal (in November 2015, May 2016 and October 2016). By differencing these clouds, we could quantify the magnitude, seasonality and spatial variability of ice cliff retreat. Mean retreat rates of 0.30-1.49 cm d(-1) were observed during the winter interval (November 2015-May 2016) and 0.74-5.18 cm d(-1) were observed during the summer (May 2016-October 2016). Four ice cliffs, which all featured supraglacial ponds, persisted over the full study period. In contrast, ice cliffs without a pond or with a steep back-slope degraded over the same period. The rate of thermo-erosional undercutting was over double that of subaerial retreat. Overall, 3-D topographic differencing allowed an improved process-based understanding of cliff evolution and cliff-pond coupling, which will become increasingly important for monitoring and modelling the evolution of thinning debris-covered glaciers.					; Rowan, Ann/AAF-1033-2019; James, Mike/C-6817-2008	Rowan, Ann/0000-0002-3715-5554; Carrivick, Jonathan/0000-0002-9286-5348; Quincey, Duncan/0000-0002-7602-7926; James, Mike/0000-0002-9177-2588; Watson, C.

Hydrological Conditions and Climatic Factors Shape Waterbird Functional Diversity in a Ramsar Site of Argentina	ECOHYDROLOGY												With global biodiversity in decline, functional biodiversity metrics help link biodiversity changes to ecosystem functioning. In wetlands, extreme events like droughts and floods challenge waterbirds, affecting survival and reproduction. At Pampean lakes in Argentina, hydrological fluctuations are significant. We examined how waterbird functional diversity responds to these changes at the Melincu & eacute; Ramsar Site, considering seasonality and whether environmental filtering or competition shapes community structure. Using waterbird counts from 1992 to 2019, we calculated functional richness, evenness, divergence and dispersion based on species traits. We employed general linear models and beta distance to assess relationships between functional diversity indices and hydrological variables, and explore assembly patterns. We recorded 71 waterbird species. Functional richness decreased by nearly 26% in drier years, indicating a loss of trait diversity under reduced hydrological conditions. Evenness correlated positively with precipitation and negatively with lake area, peaking at intermediate Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index over a 12-month period (SPEI 12) values. Divergence increased with precipitation but was lowest at intermediate SPEI 12 values and highest in summer. Dispersion peaked at intermediate lake areas, increasing with summer precipitation but decreasing with winter precipitation. Trait-convergence assembly patterns (TCAP) analysis showed community structure significantly changed with lake area, was marginally significant for SPEI 12 and not significant for precipitation. Maximum functional diversity occurred when the lake was neither too high nor too low and seasonality influenced functional diversity responses. These results highlight environmental filtering as the primary driver of waterbird assembly over time and underscore the need to incorporate hydrological dynamics into wetland conservation planning.																			1936-0584	1936-0592				APR	2025	18	3							e70053	10.1002/eco.70053	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eco.70053													WOS:001496228100016

The inversion model based on the BP neural network (the BP inversion model) was applied to a large inland reservoir in Jiangmen city, South China, according to the field observations of five water quality parameters, namely, Chlorophyl-a (Chl-a), Secchi Depth (SD), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and Permanganate of Chemical Oxygen Demand (CODMn), and twelve periods of Landsat8 satellite remote sensing images. The reservoir eutrophication was evaluated. The accuracy of the BP inversion model for each water parameter was compared with that of the linear inversion model, and the BP inversion models of two parameters (i.e., Chl-a and CODMn) with larger fluctuation range were superior to the two multiple linear inversion models due to the ability of improving the generalization of the BP neural network. The Dashahe Reservoir was basically in the state of mesotrophication and light eutrophication. The area of light eutrophication accounted for larger proportions in spring and autumn, and the reservoir inflow was the main source of nutrient salts.

J	Menking, KM; Anderson, RY				Menking, KM; Anderson, RY			Contributions of La Nina and El Nino to middle holocene drought and late Holocene moisture in the American Southwest	GEOLOGY												Eolian landforms in Estancia basin, central New Mexico, record two episodes of extreme drought and low groundwater levels during the middle Holocene (7000-5400 C-14 yr B.P.), followed by a rise in the water table through the late Holocene. Blowouts and associated lunettes formed when water levels fell below the desiccated floor of pluvial Lake Estancia, allowing widespread deflation. Elevation of the water table in the basin is regulated by a balance between evaporation from playas that occupy the blowouts and recharge of aquifers in the adjacent Manzano Mountains. Isotopic analyses of modern precipitation and groundwater reveal that recharge originates primarily as winter moisture, which is amplified during El Ninos and diminished during La Ninas. Thus, changes in the elevation of a reconstructed Holocene water table may reflect systematic changes in El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) circulation.

Lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) were sampled in mid-October each year from 1989 to 1994, except for 1992, to determine the concentration of Co-60 and Cs-134 in their tissues. The radionuclides remained in the hypolimnion until lake mixing in the autumn. Subsequently, there was more loss of Co-60 than Cs-134 from the water. After one year, 4% of the Co-60 and 15% of the Cs-134 remained in the water. This decreased to about 0.4% of the Co-60 and 0.6% of the Cs-134 in the water after five years. Little Co-60 and Cs-134 were present in lake whitefish the first autumn following the radionuclide addition. In fish, the highest concentrations were recorded in October, 1990, after which concentrations gradually decreased. Cobalt-60 concentrations were lower than Cs-134 concentrations, probably because Co-60 has a high affinity for organic particles and was not available for uptake. The relatively high Cs-134 concentrations in fish reflects its tendency to remain in the water and its continued availability to biota. Both Co-60 and Cs-134 concentrations were high in the soft tissues. Co-60 was mainly distributed in the flesh, gut, gill, kidney, and liver, whereas Cs-134 was mainly distributed in the flesh. The occurrence of relatively high Cs-134 concentrations in lake whitefish five years after their addition to the lake, long after Cs-134 concentrations are no longer detectable in lake water, attests to the continued persistence of this contaminant in aquatic biota.

AN OVERVIEW	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												The complex combination of synoptic- and mesoscale interactions, topographic influences, and large population densities poses a multitude of challenging problems to winter weather forecasters throughout the eastern United States. Over the years, much has been learned about the structure, evolution, and attendant precipitation within winter storms. As a result, numerous operational procedures, forecast applications, and objective techniques have been developed at National Weather Service offices to assess the potential for hazardous winter weather. An overview of the challenge of forecasting winter weather in the eastern United States is presented, including a historical review of several legendary winter storms, from the Blizzard of 1888 to the Halloween Nor'easter of 1991. The synoptic-scale features associated with East Coast winter storms are described. The mesoscale nature of many eastern winter weather events is illustrated through an examination of the Veterans' Day Snowstorm of 11 November 1987, and the Long Island Snowstorm of 13 December 1988. The development of applied forecast techniques and the potential for new remote sensing technologies (e.g., Doppler weather radar and wind profilers) and mesoscale models to improve operational forecasts of winter weather hazards are also discussed, Companion papers focus on cyclogenesis, terrain-related winter weather forecast considerations in the Southeast, and lake effect snow forecasting.																			0882-8156					MAR	1995	10	1					5	20		10.1175/1520-0434(1995)010<0005:WWFTTE>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0434(1995)010<0005:WWFTTE>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1995QU38500002

Comparing fish prey diversity for a critically endangered aquatic mammal in a reserve and the wild using eDNA metabarcoding	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Using environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding, we compared fish diversity in two distinct water bodies within the Yangtze River Basin with known populations of the critically endangered Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis; YFP): the Tian-e-Zhou Reserve and Poyang Lake. We aimed to create a fish surveying tool for use in the Yangtze River Basin, while also gaining a better understanding of the prey distribution and diversity within two of the remaining strongholds of YFP. 16S rRNA universal primers were developed to amplify fish eDNA. After high-throughput sequencing and stringent data filtering, we identified a total of 75 fish species (6 orders, 9 families, 57 genera) across seasons and regions. Nine of the 75 fish species were among the 28 known YFP prey species, three of which were detected in all water samples. Our eDNA metabarcoding identified many species that had been previously captured using traditional netting practices, but also numerous species not previously collected in these water bodies. Fish diversity was higher in Poyang Lake than in Tian-e-Zhou Reserve, as well as higher in the spring than in summer. These methods provide a broadly applicable tool to quantify fish diversity and distributions throughout the Yangtze River Basin, and to inform conservation strategies of YFP.

The disturbance-driven changes of periphytic algal communities in a Danubian floodplain lake	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												Disturbance event-driven changes in periphytic algal communities were studied in a Danubian floodplain using artificial substrata (glass slides). The hydrological regime of the river-floodplain system strongly influenced the physical and chemical environment of the investigated lake. Directional changes in the algal communities, demonstrated by the results of non-metric multidimensional scaling, indicated three distinct phases in periphyton development. Strong seasonal influences in the initial accrual phase favored diatom dominance in spring and rapid development of a community composed of filamentous and stalk-forming chlorophytes towards "climax" in summer. Macrophyte and metaphyton stands spreading represented a physical constraint for periphytic algal development. Irrespective of periphyton age and structure, the onset of disturbances resulted in an immediate decrease in periphytic biomass. Disturbances deeply transformed algal communities, whereas the morpho-functional properties of algal species were found to be decisive in community adaptations to altered environmental conditions. Tightly attached and stalk forming diatoms were shown to have an ability to resist and quickly recover from physical disturbance. Our results highlight the necessity for further development of the morpho-functional classification of periphytic algae, which will contribute to more precise evaluations of disturbance-driven events in freshwater ecosystems.

The mean recorded dive duration ranged from 2.8 to 6.5 min, with a maximum of 21 min. The mean dive depth ranged from 9.8 to 15.7 m, with maximum of 39.6 m. The maximum dive depth of each seal was limited by water depth in the study area. The dive depths were positively correlated with dive duration and body mass of the seal. Five different dive types were defined, as based on their depth-time characteristics, each falling into one of the three functional categories: travelling, feeding, and resting. Long duration diving bouts occurred mostly at night and were presumed to be resting dives. Saimaa ringed seals exhibited a circadian pattern of haul-out behaviour that shifted seasonally. During molting (May-June) the seals hauled-out both day and night, but later in summer haul-out was more frequent at night.																			0001-7051					MAR	2002	47	1					63	72		10.1007/BF03193567	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03193567													WOS:000174802200007

Global scale climate reconstructions and models tend to smooth out the variations and complexity of the HTM and inconsistencies between reconstructions from different locations and proxies are often attributed to bias arising from different locations or proxies. We use these differences as a source of information about seasonality and precipitation during the Holocene in a multi-proxy investigation of the sediments of Lake Pupuke, northern New Zealand. The sediments, spanning the last 16 kyr, were analysed for pollen, from which mean annual air temperatures (MAAT) and effective precipitation were estimated, and chironomids, from which summer air temperature (SmT) was estimated. We found no evidence for an HTM in the MAAT reconstruction, questioning the validity of treating the early-to-mid Holocene as an analogue for future climate change in northern New Zealand. SmT increases between 10 and 3 cal kyr BP, correlating strongly with integrated local summer insolation. Early-Holocene low seasonality (from 12 to 9.3 cal kyr BP) was likely driven by low local summer insolation intensity. An early-to-mid-Holocene wet period (9.6-7.5 cal kyr BP) corresponds to relatively high southern westerly wind (SWW) strength. Mid-to-late-Holocene summers following the wet period were hot and dry, especially 4.0-2.4 cal kyr BP, allowing the tall conifer, kauri (Agathis australis) to expand throughout northern New Zealand. Low effective precipitation at this time is consistent with increased evapotranspiration due to higher SmT, although reduced precipitation due to southward displaced SWW or increased El Nino frequency may also have contributed.

This large springtime CO2 pulse is not typically considered in surface-atmosphere flux estimates, because most field studies have not sampled through ice during late winter. Measured CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) of lake surface water ranged from 8.6 to 4,290 Pa (85-4,230 mu atm) in 234 north temperate and boreal lakes prior to ice melt during 1998 and 1999. Only four lakes had surface pCO, less than or equal to atmospheric pCO(2), whereas 75% had pCO(2) > 5 times atmospheric. The delta C-13(DIC) (DIC = Sigma CO2) of 142 of the lakes ranged from -26.28 parts per thousand to +0.95 parts per thousand. Lakes with the greatest pCO(2) also had the lightest delta C-13(DIC), which indicates respiration as their primary CO2 source. Finnish lakes that received large amounts of dissolved organic carbon from surrounding peatlands had the greatest pCO(2). Lakes set in noncarbonate till and bedrock in Minnesota and Wisconsin had the smallest pCO(2), and the heaviest delta C-13(DIC), which indicates atmospheric and/or mineral sources of C for those lakes. Potential emissions for the period after ice melt were 2.36 +/- 1.44 mol CO2 m(-2) for lakes with average pCO(2) values and were as large as 13.7 +/- 8.4 mol CO2 m(-2) for lakes with high pCO(2) values.

The concentration of PH3 ranged from 0.01 to 14.86 ng m(-3) with an average of 1.14 ng m(-3). The concentration showed a diurnal variation in PH3 with the peak occurring at morning and the lowest point at noon. An obvious seasonal variation of atmospheric PH3 was found, with the PH3 levels in the summer higher than those in the winter. The PH3 levels in the atmosphere were apparently affected by temperature, radiation, sources, and other meteorological factors. The data indicate that PH3 can be transported between the terrestrial and inshore atmosphere of Qingdao and the Yellow Sea or the East China Sea in both directions. The study increases evidence that PH3 participates within the global biogeochemical phosphorus cycle in P transport from land and inshore waters to the sea where commonly P is scarce and where PH3 inflow could be of important.					; 李, 建兵/IAN-9287-2023	Zhang, Jing/0009-0004-6810-5746; 													0049-6979	1573-2932				NOV	2009	204	1-4					117	131		10.1007/s11270-009-0031-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-009-0031-y													WOS:000271504900011

The peak biomass (12.8 g m-2 dry wt) and production (65.0 g m-2 year-1 dry wt) values for these lagoons were similar to those of temperate lotic and lentic systems. 4. The major determinants of chironomid biomass were water depth, organic content of the sediments and prey biomass. 5. Waders consumed a relatively small proportion of the total production (12%) and of the mean annual biomass (125%), because much of the production was unavailable under the current management regime. On the lagoon with the least mean depth all the available biomass was consumed during the summer and autumn. 6. Proposed management improvements include a new lagoon profile and a schedule for filling and emptying the lagoons to optimize biomass availability while ensuring continued colonization.																			0021-8901	1365-2664				MAY	1994	31	2					383	401		10.2307/2404552	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2404552													WOS:A1994NQ19800017

Because of spatial variability in monsoonal rainfall, our knowledge about climate change during the mid- to late-Holocene in southern China is still limited. We present a multi-proxy record of paleoclimatic change in a crater lake, Lake Shuangchi. Based on the age-depth model from Pb-210, Cs-137 and AMS(14)C data, high-resolution mid- to late- Holocene climatic and environmental records were reconstructed using multiple indices (TOC, TN, C/N, delta C-13 and grain size). Shuangchi underwent a marked change from a peat bog to a lake around 1.4 kaBP. The C-3 plants likely dominated during 7.0-5.9 ka and 2.5-1.4 kaBP, while C-4 plants dominated between 5.9-3.2 and 3.0-2.5 kaBP. Algae were dominant sources of organic matter in the lake sediments after 1.4 kaBP. Several intervals with high concentrations of coarser grain sizes might be due to flood events. These results reveal that several abrupt paleoclimatic events occurred around 6.6 ka, 6.1 ka, 5.9 ka, 3.0 ka, 2.5 ka and 1.4 kaBP. The paleoclimatic change recorded in the lake may be related to the migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and El Nino - Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activity.																			1000-9515	1755-6724				AUG	2020	94	4					1187	1193		10.1111/1755-6724.14566	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-6724.14566													WOS:000566569400020

The resident population of Leadville and surrounding Lake County is approximately 8300. In addition, the area is visited annually by approximately 100,000 tourists, mostly from low altitudes for its summer and winter recreational opportunities. The incidence of high-altitude pulmonary edema and its clinical characteristics, treatment and prognosis, as seen in the only hospital in Leadville were studied. High-altitude pulmonary edema is a relatively pure form of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema since those who suffer from it are otherwise healthy. Knowledge of the pathogenic mechanisms may lead to a better understanding of other forms of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema occurring in hospitalized patients with trauma and infection. High-altitude pulmonary edema apparently is a serious health problem for high-altitude dwellers in North America, and acute changes in O2 tension may have profound effects on lung function.																			0028-4793	1533-4406					1977	297	23					1269	1272		10.1056/NEJM197712082972309	http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJM197712082972309								917073					WOS:A1977EC89100009
J	Tomascak, PB; Hemming, NG; Hemming, SR				Tomascak, PB; Hemming, NG; Hemming, SR			The lithium isotopic composition of waters of the Mono Basin, California	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Mono Lake, a major closed-basin alkaline salt lake in eastern California, derives its water from a mixture of creeks and springs, with the former providing in excess of 75% of the total. The Li isotopic composition of lake water has not varied significantly over a 4 year meromictic period (delta(7)Li similar to + 19.5). Springs are isotopically distinct: groundwater springs and seeps carry water enriched in isotopically heavy Li whereas thermal springs supply isotopically light (delta(7) Li < lake), but 10 times more Li-rich, water. Isotopic fractionation during crystallization of carbonate tufa and evaporitic salt appears to be insignificant, and thus cannot be called on as a principal control of the isotopic balance of Li of the lake. Isotopic differences between the end-member source components permit a water budget to be calculated, suggesting (1) springs provide > 50% of the Li to the lake; (2) the Li budget is sensitively balanced on small thermal spring contributions, < 3% of the total spring inflow; and (3) the residence time of Li in the lake is 28 ka. Other Great Basin closed lakes have variable Li isotopic compositions ( δLi-7 from + 16.7 to +23.7), all of which differ significantly from those of several major takes and seawater (homogeneously ∼ +32).

The approach uses multiple sedimentological indicators (weight loss-on-ignition, mean grain size, grain-size fractions, bulk density, moisture content and magnetic susceptibility), an a priori model of overbank deposition of suspended glaciofluvial sediments, a detailed chronology based on 56 radiocarbon dates, and a Little Ice Age sedimentological analogue. Rapid, late-Preboreal deglaciation was indicated by immigration of Betula pubeseens by 9700 cal. BP. An interval of at least 3000 years in the early Holocene when glaciers were absent was interrupted by two abrupt episodes of, glacier expansion around the time of the Finse Event, the first at ca 8270-7900 cal. BP (Bjornbreen I Event) and the second at ca 7770-7540 cal. BP (Bjornbreen II Event). Neoglaciation began shortly before ca 5730 cal. BP with gradual build-up to the maximum of the Bjgrnbreen III Event at ca 4420 cal. BP. Later maxima occurred at ca 2750 cal. BP (Bjernbreen IV Event) and at 1300, 1260, 1060 and 790 cal. BP (all within the Bjornbreen V Event). Glaciers were smaller than today and possibly melted away on several occasions in the late Holocene (ca 3950, 1410 and 750 cal. BP). Minor maxima also occurred at ca 660 and 540 cal. BP, within the late Mediaeval Warm Period and the early Little Ice Age, respectively. The Little Ice Age maximum was dated to 213 25 BP (ca 205 cal. BP). The relative magnitudes of the main glacier maxima were determined: Erdalen Event > Little Ice Age Event (Bjornbreen VI) > Bjornbreen I (Finse Event) approximate to Bjgrnbreen II > Bjornbreen V greater than or equal to Bjornbreen IV > Bjornbreen III. These episodic events of varying magnitude and abruptness were used in conjunction with an independent summer-temperature proxy to reconstruct variations in equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) and a Holocene record of winter precipitation. Since the Preboreal, ELA varied within a range of about 390 m, and winter precipitation ranged between 40 and 160% of modern values. Winter precipitation variations appear to have been the main cause of these century- to millennial-scale Holocene glacier variations. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Dissolved oxygen status of Lake Winnipeg: Spatio-temporal and isotopic (δ18O-O2) patterns	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Spatio-temporal patterns of dissolved oxygen and its delta O-18 were obtained between 2006 and 2010 at over 50 stations in nutrient-rich Lake Winnipeg, Canada, to determine dissolved oxygen status and aquatic community metabolic balance under current eutrophic conditions. Surface water oxygen super-saturation and bottom water hypoxia were tempered due to the shallow, well-mixed, and highly turbid nature of the lake. Spatial patterns of dissolved oxygen and steady-state delta O-18 isotope mass-balance modeling showed that Lake Winnipeg is largely net heterotrophic (R:P>1.1) and under-saturated in oxygen despite high nutrient loading and recurring phytoplankton blooms. Net autotrophy was only prevalent in summer of 2006. Transient bottom water dissolved oxygen depressions occurred within a <1 m thick hypolimnion in the North Basin in summer and winter, reaching as low as 2.6 mg/L O-2. The extent and impact of potential hypoxia development in the North Basin remains a poorly studied area of concern. The use of spatio-temporal dissolved oxygen mapping and isotopic assays provided a snapshot of the current dissolved oxygen and metabolic conditions and a productivity benchmark by which to compare the outcome of future nutrient management developments in Lake Winnipeg's contributing watersheds.

Seasonal changes in these rainfall patterns are associated with changes in the position of the intertropical convergence zone, which is characterized by deep convection causing heavy rainfall near 10 degrees N in boreal summer and 3 degrees N in boreal winter. Dynamic controls on the position of the intertropical convergence zone are debated, but palaeoclimatic evidence from continental Asia, Africa and the Americas suggests that it has shifted substantially during the past millennium, reaching its southernmost position some time during the Little Ice Age (AD 1400-1850). However, without records from the meteorological core of the intertropical convergence zone in the Pacific Ocean, quantitative constraints on its position are lacking. Here we report microbiological, molecular and hydrogen isotopic evidence from lake sediments in the Northern Line Islands, Galapagos and Palau indicating that the Pacific intertropical convergence zone was south of its modern position for most of the past millennium, by as much as 500 km during the Little Ice Age. A colder Northern Hemisphere at that time, possibly resulting from lower solar irradiance, may have driven the intertropical convergence zone south. We conclude that small changes in Earth's radiation budget may profoundly affect tropical rainfall.

Analysis of the 2020 Taal Volcano tephra fall deposits from crowdsourced information and field data	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												After 43 years of dormancy, Taal Volcano violently erupted in January 2020 forming a towering eruption plume. The fall deposits covered an area of 8605 km(2), which includes Metro Manila of the National Capital Region of the Philippines. The tephra fall caused damage to crops, traffic congestion, roof collapse, and changes in air quality in the affected areas. In a tropical region where heavy rains are frequent, immediate collection of data is crucial in order to preserve the tephra fall deposit record, which is readily washed away by surface water runoff and prevailing winds. Crowdsourcing, field surveys, and laboratory analysis of the tephra fall deposits were conducted to document and characterize the tephra fall deposits of the 2020 Taal Volcano eruption and their impacts. Results show that the tephra fall deposit thins downwind exponentially with a thickness half distance of about 1.40 km and 9.49 km for the proximal and distal exponential segments, respectively. The total calculated volume of erupted fallout deposit is 0.057 km(3), 0.042 km(3), or 0.090 km(3) using the exponential, power-law, and Weibull models, respectively, and all translate to a VEI of 3. However, using a probabilistic approach (Weibull method) with 90% confidence interval, the volume estimate is as high as 0.097 km(3). With the addition of the base surge deposits amounting to 0.019 km(3), the volume translates to a VEI of 4, consistent with the classification for the observed height and umbrella radius of the 2020 main eruption plume. VEI 4 is also consistent with the calculated median eruption plume height of 17.8 km and sub-plinian classification based on combined analysis of isopleth and isopach data. Phreatomagmatic activity originated from a vent located in Taal Volcano's Main Crater Lake (MCL), which contained 42 million m(3) of water. This eruptive style is further supported by the characteristics of the ash grain components of the distal 12 January 2020 tephra fall deposits, consisting dominantly of andesitic vitric fragments (83-90%). Other components of the fall deposits are lithic (7-11%) and crystal (less than 6%) grains. Further textural and geochemical analysis of these tephra fall deposits contributes to better understand the volcanic processes that occurred at Taal Volcano, one of the 16 Decade Volcanoes identified by the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior (IAVCEI) because of its destructive nature and proximity to densely populated areas. The crowdsourcing initiative provided a significant portion of the data used for this study while at the same time educating and empowering the community to build resilience.

About 10 years after the first record of P. stratiotes, the number, abundance and biomass of indigenous and non-indigenous macrophytes as well as different abiotic parameters were measured. In that period, colonized sections (similar to 94% of the oxbow lake) were completely covered with water lettuce, and the only reservoirs of indigenous macrophyte species were the non-colonized areas (6%). Research in 2011 found only a third of the previously recorded indigenous macrophytes, but then only in small section without P stratiotes. Three of the species that disappeared were on the Red data list. In the colonized section a higher biomass was observed than in the non-colonized section because of high abundance of water lettuce which remained the only macrophyte. Due to the presence of P stratiotes, the intensity of light penetrating into the depth and water circulation were reduced, as was the oxygen saturation of the water. In addition to the well documented vegetative propagation of P. stratiotes, a well-established and viable seed bank has been detected in the lake sediment and after winter floods also on lake banks. In the future, special attention should be given to the thermal water ecosystems in temperate climates since they can serve as stepping stones and recruitment centres for the establishment and spread of (sub-)tropical invasive species. Facing predicted climate change such local populations of invasive species can act as stepping stones for further dispersal.																			0365-0588	1847-8476				APR	2020	79	1					35	42		10.37427/botcro-2020-009	http://dx.doi.org/10.37427/botcro-2020-009													WOS:000551004600007

JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Blue catfish Ictalurus furcatus and channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus, two large-bodied piscivore-omnivores in Lake Texoma, Texas-Oklahoma, U.S.A., showed er high overlap in food use, but substantial differences in use of habitat during the year. Both species primarily ate fishes, aquatic insects, vegetation and detritus, terrestrial insects, seeds and zooplankton, with overall overlap = 98%. Diet breadth indices were very similar (blue catfish = 4(.)31, channel catfish = 4(.)53). Quantitative and qualitative feeding varied seasonally and food habits changed ontogenetically. Feeding intensity was greatest in winter and lowest in late summer, Aquatic insects were eaten more from May to October and fishes more in winter. At body sizes from 100 to 299 mm L-S, both species primarily ate aquatic insects, terrestrial insects, fishes or zooplankton, whereas the diets of individuals > 300 mm L-S of both species were dominated by fishes. Overall, their overlap in distribution across major habitat types was only 58%, with blue catfish most abundant in deep water offshore, and channel catfish more common in shallow cove habitats. Blue catfish that did occur in coves were in the deeper parts of those habitats, essentially not occurring in the littoral zone. In takes without blue catfish, channel catfish are widely dispersed in various habitats and it is suspected that displacement of channel catfish by blue catfish may influence habitat differences of the two species in Lake Texoma, Because the spatial separation of the species also reflects their typical interspecific differences in unimpounded drainages, however, the habitat differences observed in Lake Texoma probably also reflect evolved, historical differences in ecology) of the two species.

J	ALT, KT				ALT, KT			CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE LIFE-HISTORY OF THE HUMPBACK-WHITEFISH IN ALASKA	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Modal gill raker counts of Coregonus pidschian from various areas of Alaska [USA] ranged from 21-26, with populations of coastal streams having lower counts. Humpback whitefish are mainly distributed north of the Alaska Range and are found in lakes, streams and brackish water. Feeding migrations into lake and slough areas of many Alaskan waters occur soon after ice breakup, with an outmigration occurring during freeze-up. Many spawning populations migrate upstream during summer and fall and spawn in upper reaches of rivers. Spawning generally occurs during late Sept. and Oct. over gravel bottoms. Humpback whitefish studied reached 540 mm fork length and age XiV. Populations from interior Alaska waters grow faster than coastal populations, with Chatanika River fish reaching 442 mm at age VIII. First maturity is usually reached between ages V and VII. Main utilization of the humpback whitefish in Alaska is for subsistence but small commercial and sport fisheries exist in interior Alaska.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1979	108	2					156	160		10.1577/1548-8659(1979)108<156:CTTLHO>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1979)108<156:CTTLHO>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1979GZ27600006

At the time, the fisheries damage on the oyster culture due to the bloom was estimated at about JPY 190 million. Also in summer 2010, H. circularisquama formed a bloom in Lake Kamo, but in this case, no oyster kill was recorded. In the present study, we measured the temporal change in the abundance of viruses causing lysis of H. circularisquama and compared it with the host dynamics. We checked the host specificity and virus sensitivity of the isolated virus clones and host clones, respectively. Different types of host and virus clone dominantly coexisted in this lake, and the intraspecies host specificity of each HcRNAV clone isolated in Lake Kamo, 2010, agreed well with the host range predicted based on the deduced amino acid sequence of the major capsid protein (MCP). Considering the contemporary appearance of the host and virus, viral infection was assumed to be one of the factors affecting the dynamics of H. circularisquama population in this lake.																			0021-3551					JUL	2013	47	3					329	338																WOS:000327509000011

Altogether, 346 different diatom taxa were recorded in the 66 samples analyzed. The diversity indices H(S) and .DELTA. are examined in relation to environmental conditions in the lakes. Within each of 3 geographic regions distinguished on the basis of the main vegetation types, the diversity index .DELTA. and the P concentration supported each other in indicating pollution. This was not true with .DELTA. and the conductivity of the lake water. An advantage of diversity indices in monitoring work is that long lists of organisms can be condensed into a single value. Such indices, however, should be used only as additional information.																			0003-3847	1797-2442					1978	15	3					138	146																WOS:A1978FY35800002
J	Yang, C; Chen, SH; Guan, TP				Yang, Chen; Chen, Siheng; Guan, Tianpei			Does wetland degradation impact bird diversity differently across seasons? A case study of Zoige Alpine Wetland ecosystem	AVIAN RESEARCH												Wetland degradation is an escalating global challenge with profound impacts on animal diversity, particularly during successional processes. Birds, as highly mobile and environmentally sensitive organisms, serve as effective indicators of ecological change. While previous studies have primarily focused on local community structures and species diversity during a specific season, there is a need to extend the research timeframe and explore broader spatial variations. Additionally, expanding from simple species diversity indices to more multidimensional diversity indices would provide a more comprehensive understanding of wetland health and resilience. To address these gaps, we investigated the effects of wetland degradation on bird diversity across taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional dimensions in the Zoige Wetland, a plateau meadow wetland biodiversity hotspot. Surveys were conducted during both breeding (summer) and overwintering (winter) seasons across 20 transects in 5 sampling areas, representing 4 degradation levels (pristine, low, medium, and high). Our study recorded a total of 106 bird species from 32 families and 14 orders, revealing distinct seasonal patterns in bird community composition and diversity. Biodiversity indices were significantly higher in pristine and low-degraded wetlands, particularly benefiting waterfowl (Anseriformes, Ciconiiformes) and wading birds (Charadriiformes) in winter, when these areas provided superior food resources and habitat conditions. In contrast, medium and highly degraded wetlands supported increased numbers of terrestrial birds (Passeriformes) and raptors (Accipitriformes, Falconiformes). Seasonal differences in taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity indices highlighted the contrasting ecological roles of wetlands during breeding and overwintering periods. Furthermore, indicator species analysis revealed key species associated with specific degradation levels and seasons, providing valuable insights into wetland health. This study underscores the importance of spatiotemporal dynamics in understanding avian responses to wetland degradation. By linking seasonal patterns of bird diversity to habitat conditions, our findings contribute to conservation efforts and provide a framework for assessing wetland degradation and its ecological impacts.					guan, tianpei/ABG-4874-2020	yang, chen/0000-0001-5186-9847													2053-7166					MAR	2025	16	1							100227	10.1016/j.avrs.2025.100227	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.avrs.2025.100227													WOS:001447639200001
J	Delong, MD; Thorp, JH; Greenwood, KS; Miller, MC				Delong, MD; Thorp, JH; Greenwood, KS; Miller, MC			Responses of consumers and food resources to a high magnitude, unpredicted flood in the upper Mississippi River basin	REGULATED RIVERS-RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT												The Mississippi and Missouri Rivers experienced flooding in 1993 that fell outside the annual predictable flood period of spring and early summer. Flooding began in late June, peaked in late July (25732 m(3)/s on the upper Mississippi and 21240 m(3)/s on the Missouri) and remained at or near flood stage into October 1993. This study was performed to determine if disturbance by an unpredicted flood event would alter trophic dynamics of river-floodplain systems by creating shifts in the composition of organic matter available to consumers. The Ohio River, which did not flood during the same period, was examined for comparison. Stable isotopic ratios of carbon and nitrogen from samples collected in 1993 and 1994 were used to characterize potential food sources and determine linkages between food sources and invertebrate and fish consumers. Pairwise contrasts, performed separately For each river, indicated there were few interannual differences in delta C-13 and delta N-15 of organic matter sources and consumers. Between sample period (flood year versus normal water year) trends in both flooded rivers were similar to between-year trends observed for the Ohio River. Trophic structure of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers was similar in both years. with fine and ultra-fine transported organic matter and dissolved organic matter representing the major sources of organic matter. Overlapping isotopic signatures in the Missouri River made tracking of sources through the consumers difficult, but similarities in delta C-13 and delta N-15 between years indicated trophic structure did not change in response to the flood. The results suggest that consumers continued to rely on sources of organic matter that would be used in the absence of the unpredicted 1993 flood. It is proposed that trophic structure did not change in response to flooding in the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers because both rivers exhibited the same trends observed in the Ohio River.

J	Hülsmann, S				Hülsmann, S			Recruitment patterns of Daphnia:: a key for understanding midsummer declines?	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The population dynamics of D. galeata was studied during the period May - July of 5 successive years in Bautzen Reservoir ( Germany). Sampling intervals of 3 - 4 days and knowledge of the egg - age distribution made it possible to calculate recruitment of the population for each sampling interval. In every year, high Daphnia densities and high Secchi depth readings (clear-water stage) were recorded in spring. In two of the 5 years, Daphnia abundance remained on a high level throughout summer, whereas in the remaining 3 years a midsummer decline of Daphnia was observed. Birth rates declined while the abundance increased in spring in every year but the timing of this decline in relation to abundance and the onset of the clear-water stage revealed no obvious pattern, distinguishing between years with or without a midsummer decline. However, cumulative recruitment did reveal a clear pattern: in years without a midsummer decline, cumulative recruitment increased slowly, but continually, starting from a low level in early May. By contrast, in years with a midsummer decline, recruitment increased strongly during one week in May, starting from a relatively high density level (> 30 ind. l(-1)). This quick increase was followed by extended periods with low recruitment. Consequently, in these years the population was dominated by a strong peak-cohort of about the same age during the clear-water stage. If all members of this cohort, while approaching their maximum life-span, die off during a short time interval, this may have a pronounced effect on the initiation of a midsummer decline. From an extensive literature search, evidence is provided that the findings of this study represent a demographic mechanism which is of general importance for the initiation of a midsummer decline in temperate waters.

Activity of both enzymes varied with depth and season. Highest activity was measured in July and high activities were monitored during the stratified period. Low values were observed in winter, when oxic conditions prevail in the water column and no organic sedimentation occurred. The values for APase ranged from 14-438 nmol PNP g(-1)h(-1) and for arylsulfatase from 103 to 843 nmol PNP g(-1)h(-1). Highest APase activity was recorded at 29 degrees C, and most of it took place on mud particles and not in the interstitial waters. There were differences in enzyme activity at different stations in the lake, corresponding to differences in nutrient pore water concentrations. Enzymatic activity in Lake Kinneret sediments was related to lake trophic status, water levels, and climate conditions, all of which have an impact on the amount of organic matter reaching the sediments.																			0049-6979					OCT	1997	99	1-4					671	679		10.1023/A:1018388817351	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1018388817351													WOS:A1997XW68200069

Reconstructing past changes in high-latitude precipitation and hydroclimate from networks of continuous lake records offers one way to improve forecasts of precipitation and precipitation-evaporation balances, but these reconstructions are currently hindered by the incomplete understanding of controls on lake and soil water isotopes. Here, we study the distribution of modern water isotopes in Icelandic lakes, streams, and surface soils collected in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2014, 2019, and 2020 to understand the geographic, geomorphic, and environmental controls on their regional and interannual variability. We find that lake water isotopes in open-basin (through-flowing) lakes reflect local precipitation, with biases toward the cold season, particularly in lakes with sub-annual residence times. Closed-basin lakes have water isotope and deuterium excess values consistent with evaporative enrichment. Interannual and seasonal variabilities of lake water isotopes at repeatedly sampled sites are consistent with instrumental records of winter snowfall; summer relative humidity; and atmospheric circulation patterns, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation. Summer surface soil water isotopes span the entire range of seasonal precipitation values in Iceland and appear to be consistently overprinted by evaporative enrichment, which can occur throughout the year, although the sampling depths were shallower than rooting depths for many plant types. This dataset provides new insight into the functionality of water isotopes in Icelandic environments and offers renewed possibilities for optimized site selection and proxy interpretation in future paleohydrological studies on this North Atlantic outpost.					; Geirsdottir, Aslaug/L-3267-2015; Geirsdóttir, Áslaug/L-3267-2015; Axford, Yarrow/N-4151-2014	Raberg, Jonathan/0000-0003-2959-3631; Florian, Christopher/0000-0003-4217-0684; Geirsdottir, Aslaug/0000-0003-3125-0195; Miller, G H/0000-0002-8225-2740; Harning, David/0000-0002-2648-1346; 													1027-5606	1607-7938				SEP 18	2024	28	18					4275	4293		10.5194/hess-28-4275-2024	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-4275-2024													WOS:001314478800001

Both sequences exhibited a stable primary component of the NRM direction, allowing a comparison of the secular variation records with the chronology of Lake Nautajarvi reference curves (NRM) to provide a chronological framework for the present study The basins of Lakes Pihtsusjarvi and Haltijarvi were formed 10500 and 5500 cal. BP, respectively. Minerogenic layers found from studied Lake Pihtsusjarvi sequences provided evidence of postglacial activity of the Halti fell valley glacier. The results indicated that the Halti glacier was active soon after the continental ice sheet had retreated from the area at around 10000-9000 cal. BP, during which time the Kovdajohka valley terminal and recessional moraines were formed. This was followed by a Holocene thermal maximum (HTM) in northern Fermoscandia, which was interrupted by climate cooling at around 6000 cal. BP. The basal age of the Lake Haltijarvi sediment core and Lake Pihtsusjarvi sediment stratigraphy indicated minor, short-term neoglacial activity in the Halti fell vicinity between c. 6000 and 5500 cal.

Low irradiance, ice, and snow cover cause poor light penetration into the water column of these lakes. Therefore, in northern lakes, respiration often exceeds primary production leading to low dissolved oxygen concentrations. This study aimed to quantify under-ice metabolic processes during winter in an arid zone lake with little snow cover. This study was carried out in a mid-latitude lake in Inner Mongolia, northern China. The study lake receives relatively high incoming solar radiation on the ice in mid-winter, and radiation can penetrate down to the bottom sediment as the lake is shallow and the ice lacks snow cover. Primary production and respiration were estimated during two winters using high-frequency sensor measurements of dissolved oxygen. To quantify under-ice metabolic processes, sensors were deployed to different depths. During both winters, sensors collected data every 10 min over several weeks. The amount of solar radiation controlled photosynthesis under ice; temperature and photosynthesis together appeared to control respiration. The balance between gross primary production and ecosystem respiration was especially sensitive to changes in snow cover, and the balance between P and R decreased. Our data suggest that photosynthesis by plankton, submerged plants, and epiphytic algae may continue over winter in shallow lakes in mid-latitudes when there is no snow cover on the ice, as may occur in arid climates. The continuation of photosynthesis under ice buffers against dissolved oxygen depletion and prevents consequent harmful ecosystem effects.					; Li, Zhijun/A-5299-2019; Uusheimo, Sari/AAC-6642-2020; shi, XIAOHONG/KRP-1855-2024	Uusheimo, Sari/0000-0002-3098-0922; Loehr, John/0000-0002-6212-0273; song, shuang/0000-0002-1169-9844													0046-5070	1365-2427				OCT	2019	64	10					1710	1720		10.1111/fwb.13363	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13363		JUL 2019											WOS:000478675100001

Daily flows for related studies are presently furnished by Water Survey of Canada, based on the records of a hydrometric station located close to the delta entrance. The relative proximity of the Beaufort Sea affects the local water surface slope, amplifying uncertainties that are normally associated with under-ice flow estimates. It is shown that gauge-derived spring flows often do not agree with other evidence, such as past discharge measurements, flows at the next upstream gauge, and hydraulic computations for the 2008 event. This appears to result in inconsistencies between spring flow hydrograph and observed severity of ice breakup. Options for improving spring flow estimates are discussed and installation of an auxiliary water-level gauge near Point Separation is recommended as a practical choice.

However, there is still a conspicuous lack of consistency in subsequent reports. On the basis of an overall investigation of 15 eutrophic rivers on the Lower Yangze-Huai River Plain, the seasonal successions of phytoplankton according to morpho-functional groups (MFGs) were clustered. The results indicated fundamental agreement with the classic paradigm, but differences were found and tended to converge to at least three regular patterns. They were characterized respectively by: (1) winter peaks of large diatoms and a summer peak of cyanobacteria colonies, different zooplankton dominating alternately; (2) only a summer peak of blue-green filaments, rotifers dominating all year round; and (3) composite peaks of filamentous cyanobacteria, centric diatoms and small flagellates, extremely low zooplankton density. All were potentially driven by anthropogenic influences through significantly changing water environments. Pattern 1 often developed in rivers with slow flow controlled by physicochemical factors, which was attributed to high levels of water retention. Pattern 2 often developed in rivers with massive suspended sediment controlled by hydrological features, which was attributed to massive shipping. Pattern 3 often developed in rivers with significant levels of organic pollutants controlled by dissolved oxygen, which were attributed to the agricultural load and over-industrialization. As a successful application of MFGs, we suggest that this type of morpho-functional approach for phytoplankton performed better in statistical analysis targeted to general ecological laws than to local details about just one specific water body, though this approach still needs to be improved.																			0003-4088	2100-000X					2016	52						217	233		10.1051/limn/2016007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2016007													WOS:000383570500019
J	Kohler, J				Kohler, J			Growth, production and losses of phytoplankton in the lowland River Spree: Carbon balance	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Phytoplankton carbon assimilation and losses (exudation, dark carbon losses) as well as oxygen release and dark community respiration were measured regularly for 2 years at four stations along the lower Spree (Germany). Carbon balance of river phytoplankton was estimated using measured assimilation, metabolic losses and variations in algal carbon along a stretch of river. 2. The light/dark bottle method was modified to simulate vertical mixing. 3. Waxing and waning of phytoplankton populations dominated the load of particulate organic carbon as well as the oxygen budget of the river. 4. Phytoplankton assimilated 310-358 g C m(-2) yr(-1). A mean value of 586 mg C m(-3) day(-1) was fixed in photosynthesis, with 16.7 mg C being exuded during the day and 20.1 mg lost at night. The measured dark respiration was equivalent to only 28% of the daily gross oxygen production of the plankton community. Phytoplankton washed from upstream lakes and reservoirs was not measurably damaged by turbulent transport. 5. In spring, 18-22% of assimilated carbon was used for net biosynthesis of phytoplankton along the river course. At this time, the carbon balance of this part of the Spree was dominated by autochthonous net production. During summer, however, total carbon losses exceeded the intensive carbon assimilation. The decline of algal biomass along the river course in summer was not explicable by measurable physiological losses. The importance of sedimentation and grazing losses is discussed.					; Köhler, Jan/C-2633-2014	Kohler, Jan/0000-0003-1894-2912; 													0046-5070					DEC	1995	34	3					501	512		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1995.tb00908.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1995.tb00908.x													WOS:A1995TP03400010

BOLLETTINO DELLA SOCIETA GEOLOGICA ITALIANA												The depression that contains the largest Italian lake (370 km(2)) during the ice ages was occupied by a huge glacier resulting from the junction of the Sarca and Adige glaciers. The end-moraine complex consists of numerous concentric hills that gently slope down towards the lake shorelines. The morainic reliefs are separated by intramorainic depressions. No bedrock crops out in the area, with the exception of the northern terminations of the amphitheatre, where the oldest and more elevated moraines are found. The glacial and/or fluvio-glacial deposits and their soils display a mineral composition and grain-size distribution highly favourable to grape-growing, which has been practized since the times of the Roman Age in the area south of the Sirmione peninsula. Soils range from hapludalfs to eutrochrept and are rich in carbonates. Drainage is good to moderate. The climate is mitigated by the large south alpine lake with mild winters and temperate-warm summers. Precipitations, exceeding 800 mm/y, are distributed in three seasons so that the summer deficit (temperature/evapotranspiration) is limited and no watering is required, unless in special cases. The entire end-moraine complex, that covers an area of approximately 400 km(2), is occupied by appellations (DOCs) partly overlapping, the first recognized being Lugana, in 1967. Viticulture is highly specialized, but not a real monoculture, and the Garda wines (mostly white, but also rose and red) are well known and appreciated.

Samples were collected once a month from January to December 2012. The percentage of Potamothrix hammoniensis individuals with a developed reproductive system varied in individual lakes and ranged from 14 to 72%. There was no correlation between the distinguished lake types and the proportion of sexually mature individuals. The reproductive activity was not observed in summer and early autumn. Among the measured parameters, the highest values of the Pearson correlation coefficient were found between the percentage of individuals with a developed reproductive system and the conductivity (r = 0.69; p < 0.001), pH (r = 0.51; p = 0.002) and the organic matter content in the sediments (r = -0.42; p = 0.012). It is worth noting that there was no correlation between the percentage of sexually mature specimens and the water temperature (r = -0.22, p = 0.204) and the oxygen concentration (r = -0.08; p = 0.648).

It was estimated that between 1100 and 1650 m(3) x 10(6) of ice volume was lost during this time period. The median value of 1375 m(3) x 10(6) was converted to a water equivalence value of approximately 1170 m(3) x 10(6) by assuming a glacier ice (including fim and voids)/water ratio of approximately 85%. The bulk glacier wastage estimate was divided into proportions using the Peyto Glacier mass balance record. Unfortunately, the record began in 1966 and a back-cast to 1952 was necessary. Banff maximum summer temperature and Lake Louise snow course data were used as surrogates for summer and winter glacier mass balance, respectively. Seasonal wastage contributions to river flow were estimated for 1967 to 1974 using modelled values of glacial melt (ice and firn only) generated for Peyto Creek by Young (1982). An estimate of the temporal variation of glacier recession inputs to the Bow River hydrograph at Banff was facilitated by comparing known basin yields with the modelled wastage values. For 1952 to 1993, the average annual wastage/basin yield ratio is found to be around 2.3%. For the extremely low flow year of 1970 this ratio increases to 12.5%. The proportion of flow derived from glacier recession in August of this year is estimated to be around 53%. It is thought that the mass balance back-cast may slightly under-estimate wastage values in the early part of the time series, therefore, leading to an over-estimation later on.																			0161-0589						1997							91	102																WOS:000071608400010

To investigate the distribution patterns and enrichment mechanisms of these elements in hot spring, the hydrochemistry types, stable isotopes (delta D and delta O-18), and element concentrations of the hot springs were tested. The results indicate that: (1) The hydrochemical types of the hot springs are relatively complex, primarily consisting of Na-Cl, Ca-HCO, and Ca-Na-HCO, mixed types; (2) The concentrations of Li, Rb, and Cs in the hot springs exhibit both high and low values, with high values being 2 similar to 3 orders of magnitude greater than the low values. From the hillside to the foot of the mountain, the concentrations of these elements inercase. The fumarole hot springs, which eject vertically on the hillside, have low Li, Rb, and Cs concentrations (averaging 10. 6 mu g/L, 19.9 mu g/L, and 11.0 mu g/L, respectively), similar to the concentrations in shallow groundwater and river water in the region, and exhibit Rh/Cs > 1. This is attributed to shallow circulating infiltrated water heated by geothermal steam separated from deep geothermal fluids. In contrast, the hot springs that eject laterally and vertically at the foot of the mountain, as well as the converged hot springs, show high concentrations of Li, Rb, and Cs (averaging 69. 1mg/1., 11.5mg/1., and 18. 8mg/1., respectively). The Rb and Cs distribution patterns in these hot springs are similar to those observed in Tibetan hot springs (Rh/Cs <1), but the Li and Rb concentrations are higher than in Tibetan hot springs, indicating the influence of deep geothermal water. (3) The hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions indicate that the hot springs originate from magmatic water, atmospheric precipitation, and shallow circulating groundwater. During the upward migration of the hot springs. mixing with shallow circulating infiltrated groundwater occurs. (4) The enrichment of Li, Rb, and Cs in the hot springs is controlled by multiple processes, including water-rock interactions with deep magmatic water, weathering and leaching of high-temperature shallow groundwater, and surface evaporation concentration. The enrichment process of Li, Rb, and Cs involves deep magmatic water ascending through water-rock interactions, followed by silicate weathering and leaching processes in shallow underground hot water systems, ultimately resulting in concentration through surface. This study enhances the theoretical understanding of the enrichment mechanisms of rare metals such as Li, Rb, and Cs in hot springs.

WDs primarily transport moisture from the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, while ISM transports moisture from the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. Local moisture sources also contribute to the regional precipitation budget. The moisture sources can be distinguished by measuring dual isotopic signatures in precipitation. Oxygen and hydrogen isotopic ratios measured in daily precipitation samples collected at Srinagar, Kashmir from March 2015-April 2017, allowed delineating the role of factors like large-scale moisture transport processes, and local meteorological factors such as temperature, precipitation amount and relative humidity on the precipitation isotope ratios and its effect on the meteoric water line parameters. Isotopic data were further used to estimate the percentage contributions of distinct moisture sources across different seasons and validation of an isotope enabled general circulation model (iEGCM). We found that the time integrated, large-scale convection over several days, constitutes a major factor governing the isotopic composition of precipitation, while the role of local meteorological parameters is minimal. A box model to simulate the moisture transport and estimate the oceanic versus terrestrially recycled moisture sources to the regional precipitation reveals Arabian sea to be the key moisture source. Finally, on comparing the observed isotopic composition with iEGCM simulation, discrepancies are noted. Results from the present study will enable improving the interpretation of regional paleo-climate data derived from various proxy records. Plain Language Summary Mainland India receives precipitation mainly during summer (commonly known as the Indian Summer Monsoon) whereas, further inland, toward the Western Himalayas the precipitation is mainly received during winter (commonly known as the Western Disturbances). Measurements of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in atmospheric and terrestrial water are cornerstones in paleoclimate and modern hydrological studies and give an indication of the presence and magnitude of key hydrological and atmospheric processes. Observations on the isotopic composition of precipitation over the Western Himalayas are poor, limiting our understanding of the precipitation forming mechanisms and hence, interpretations of paleo-climate proxies. In this study, we found that the local meteorological factors exert a minor influence but time integrated large-scale convection over several days majorly governs the precipitation isotopic composition. By developing an atmospheric transport model, it is revealed that Arabian sea as chief moisture source to precipitation in the Western Himalayas. Furthermore, we found deficiencies in one of the isotope enabled global climate model to predict the isotopic composition of precipitation in the Western Himalayas.					; Brand, Willi/D-2043-2009; Hillaire-Marcel, Claude/C-9153-2013; Hillaire-Marcel, Claude/H-1441-2012	Ghosh, Prosenjit/0000-0001-7828-577X; Dar, Shaakir Shabir/0000-0001-8739-269X; Hillaire-Marcel, Claude/0000-0002-3733-4632; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				APR 16	2021	126	7							e2020JD032853	10.1029/2020JD032853	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JD032853													WOS:000640969000010

Unusually large loads in 2007 from the Maumee and Sandusky Rivers, tributaries to Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												During water year 2007 (October 1, 2006, through September 30, 2007), the Maumee River and Sandusky River in northern Ohio transported the largest, or nearly the largest, loads of several water quality constituents that have been observed in 33 years of monitoring. Discharge, total phosphorus, dissolved reactive phosphorus, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, and chloride all recorded 33-year maximum loads, while the loads for nitrate ranked 5th (Sandusky) and 8th (Maumee) out of 33. Loads of particulate phosphorus ranked 2nd (Sandusky) and. 4th (Maumee), and those for suspended solids ranked 10th (Sandusky) and 9th (Maumee). This is partly a consequence of total rainfall, which was the largest observed at the Tiffin weather station (Sandusky watershed) and nearly the largest at the Toledo station (Maumee watershed) during this period. It also results from other aspects of the weather in interaction with agricultural practices, notably a warm, wet fall and early winter. Longer-term trends were also significant factors for some parameters. The weather was the major factor responsible for these large loads. Regardless of cause, these loads represent a substantial loss of resources from agricultural fields in the watersheds. This loss could have been reduced by better management. Losses of sediment and phosphorus from these watersheds are higher than average for Midwestern agricultural watersheds, and losses of nitrogen are slightly above average. Based on winter 2008 fertilizer prices from local fertilizer dealers, replacing the nutrients lost from these watersheds in water year 2007 would cost more than $80,000,000 or $166 ha(-1) ($67 ac(-1)) for every field in the watershed receiving fertilizer in a given year.

Water samples were collected monthly between November 2013 and October 2014 from 5 major rivers, 3 major cold springs, 3 tepid springs and 1 hot spring. The temperatures of each spring were nearly constant over the sampling period attesting for their groundwater character, while the temperatures of the rivers were much more variable. The rivers monthly delta H-2 and delta O-18 range from -6.8 parts per thousand to 1.9 parts per thousand and -3.1 parts per thousand to 1.6 parts per thousand, respectively, while springs showed depleted values that span from -10.2 to -1.1 parts per thousand for delta H-2 and - 3.6 to -1.9 parts per thousand for delta O-18. Catchment morphology (formed of depression, upper footslope and medium to high gradient-mountains) and the local tectonic discontinuity (fissures and faults) regulate the surface runoff and subsurface flow, control the precipitation infiltration zones and hence the aquifers recharge areas. Chemical and isotopic (delta O-18 and delta H-2) compositions of springs and rivers reveal the presence of shallow and deep aquifers, with some waters having intermediate isotope composition. Three different recharge zones characterized by different altitudes were identified: the first is found at low altitude ranging from similar to 1800 m to similar to 2150 m, the second and intermediate recharge zone in the altitude range from similar to 2180 m to similar to 2500 m at the upper footslope area, while the third and highest recharge area is located in the altitudes range from similar to 2620 to similar to 3220 m. The two upper recharge areas are the most fractured and fissured zones allowing rapid infiltration of depleted precipitations which recharge deep aquifers found in the tepid and hot springs. Based on their chemical and isotopic composition, waters from the shallow and deep aquifers have been considered representative of mixing end members. During their ascent to the surface, water from the deep aquifer mixes with that of shallow aquifer yielding the tepid springs of intermediate chemical and isotopic composition, while the other keep their original fingerprint corresponding to the isotopically depleted hot spring.					; Liotta, Marcello/C-4974-2012; Arienzo, Ilenia/AFI-6319-2022	Balagizi, Charles/0000-0003-0313-2626; Cuoco, Emilio/0000-0002-4637-1814													0009-2541	1872-6836				APR 5	2022	594								120778	10.1016/j.chemgeo.2022.120778	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2022.120778		FEB 2022											WOS:000768034000016

Reconstruction of annual winter rainfall since AD1579 in central-eastern Spain based on calcite laminated sediment from Lake La Cruz	CLIMATIC CHANGE												We present the first winter (December to March) rainfall reconstruction based in a novel proxy, the thickness of annual calcite laminations preserved in Lake La Cruz (central-eastern Spain). A previous calibration analysis between laminae thickness and the instrumental data series (1950 to present) indicated a highly significant correlation with winter rainfall. Therefore this study attempts the winter rainfall reconstruction since the onset of laminations (1579 a.d.) by means of the calibration function previously developed. The verification analysis between inferred annual values and earlier instrumental data (1859-1949) confirms the suitability of this novel proxy and the reliability of the series reconstructed. The reconstructed series show the fluctuating character of winter rainfall in the western Mediterranean area; interdecadal dry periods alternated with wetter periods following, in a board sense, the pattern recorded by documentary sources in other regions of the Iberian Peninsula. At present times regional winter rainfall anomalies are highly correlated with the phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). However the time series analysis showed the dominance of nonstationary components at high frequencies of the climate signal over the last four centuries suggesting that the connection between winter rainfall and the NAO has not been stable over time and also other modes of variability, not only NAO, may have conditioned winter rainfall variability.					; Camacho, Antonio/I-3417-2015; Romero-Viana, Lidia/L-9572-2014; Julia, Ramon/AAB-5373-2019; Schimmel, Martin/C-2261-2008; Miracle, Maria/G-3482-2016	Vicente-Pedros, Eduardo/0000-0002-8814-9912; Camacho, Antonio/0000-0003-0841-2010; Schimmel, Martin/0000-0003-2601-4462; 													0165-0009	1573-1480				AUG	2011	107	3-4					343	361		10.1007/s10584-010-9966-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-010-9966-7													WOS:000293288400008
J	Jones, B; Peng, XT				Jones, Brian; Peng, Xiaotong			Mineralogical, crystallographic, and isotopic constraints on the precipitation of aragonite and calcite at Shigiang and other hot springs in Yunnan Province, China	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Two active spring vent pools at Shiqiang (Yunnan Province, China) are characterized by a complex array of precipitates that coat the wall around the pool and the narrow ledges that surround the vent pool. These precipitates include arrays of aragonite crystals, calcite cone-dendrites, red spar calcite, unattached dodecahedral and rhombohedral calcite crystals, and late stage calcite that commonly coats and disguises the earlier formed precipitates. Some of the microbial mats that grow on the ledges around the pools have been partly mineralized by microspheres that are formed of Si and minor amounts of Fe. The calcite and aragonite that are interspersed with each other at all scales are both primary precipitates. Some laminae, for example, change laterally from aragonite to calcite over distances of only a few millimetres. The precipitates at Shiqiang are similar to precipitates found in and around the vent pools of other springs found in Yunnan Province, including those at Gongxiaoshe, Zhuyuan, Eryuan, and Jifei. In all cases, the delta D-water and delta(18)O(wate)r indicate that the spring water is of meteoric origin. These are thermogene springs with the carrier CO2 being derived largely from the mantle and reaction of the waters with bedrock. Variations in the delta C-13(travertine) values indicate that the waters in these springs were mixed, to varying degrees, with cold groundwater and its soil-derived CO2. Calcite and aragonite precipitation took place once the spring waters had become supersaturated with respect to CaCO3, probably as a result of rapid CO2 degassing. These precipitates, which were not in isotopic equilibrium with the spring water, are characterized by their unusual crystal morphologies. The precipitation of calcite and aragonite, seemingly together, can probably be attributed to microscale variations in the saturation levels that are, in turn, attributable to microscale variations in the rate of CO2 degassing.

Spatial analysis of bacteria in brackish lake sediment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH												The spatial distribution of bacterial communities inhabiting sediment is heterogeneous at different spatial scales, but mostly unexplored. Here, it is postulated that the heterogeneity of the bacterial community composition varies at the same scale of the heterogeneity of sediment chemical properties. The large spatial scale (km) diversity in sediment from a brackish water lagoon (Chilika Lake, India) is studied, considering the large scale physical and chemical characteristics of land cover, climate, pH, and salinity. Seventy-two samples (24 stations, 3 seasons: winter, rainy, and summer) of sediment from Chilika Lake were analyzed by 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene sequencing, and the relations with land cover and other physico-chemical parameters are discussed. More samples were collected after a severe cyclonic storm (Phailin) passed near the lagoon in 2013, to see the impact of the tropical storm on the spatial and temporal distribution of bacteria in the sediment. The results demonstrate clear spatial relations between physico-chemical parameters (e.g., salinity), land surfaces (e.g., drainage area), and the distribution of sediment microbial communities.

Factor analysis was used to identify interrelationships between dissolved species during this period, and to determine physical processes controlling their behaviour. Analysis of the full dataset identified species which varied predominantly on an episodic timescale, and species which were subject to seasonal cycles. Two-month subsets of data were defined to remove the influence of seasonal cycles, and factor analysis of individual subsets then allowed episodic behaviour to be examined for each 2 month period. Results showed that base cation dilution was a consistent cause of changes in acid neutralising capacity (ANC) in all four streams. NO3- exhibited strong seasonality in concentration and also in episode behaviour, increasing during winter-snowmelt episodes, but diluting during some summer episodes. DOC concentrations also varied seasonally, but 2 month analysis indicated episodic increases during all periods. SO42- did not exhibit consistent episodic behaviour, as it was strongly influenced by antecedent conditions. Behaviour of Ca2+ and Mg2+ was apparently influenced by a significant soil source in three of the streams.

Although Photovoltaic (PV) technology has been used with large scale in Egypt in different applications, it's still suffering from losing its efficiency due to high temperature, dust accumulation which is common in Egypt especially in spring and summer seasons, besides the intense land requirements and power intermittency. Therefore, a novel partially floating modular PV system is proposed in this study to supply rural areas around the Egyptian North Lakes with green electricity. The PV system is integrated with a hybrid compressed air energy storage system and managed with a smart energy management strategy to extend its operating hours and enables its day and night continuous operation. The smart system also enables different operational modes of the PV system which includes sun tracking, cleaning, cooling, and surviving modes. The aim of this study is to introduce the conceptual design of the proposed concept and the smart controlling system, its different operational modes, the supporting platform and its hydrodynamics performance.					; Bassam, Ameen/U-2846-2017; Amin, Islam/D-8720-2017; Elhenawy, Yasser/V-4038-2019; Bassam, A/I-7731-2018; Amin, Islam/AAQ-9196-2020; Soliman, Heba/AAA-2533-2020; Elminshawy, Nabil/AAD-3470-2019	Elhenawy, Yasser/0000-0002-4124-2431; Bassam, Ameen/0000-0001-7366-7293; Amin, Islam/0000-0003-0758-5630; Elminshawy, Nabil/0000-0002-0715-1245; 													0029-8018	1873-5258				JUL 1	2023	279								114416	10.1016/j.oceaneng.2023.114416	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.oceaneng.2023.114416		MAY 2023											WOS:001024203000001
J	Bakke, J; Lie, O; Nesje, A; Dahl, SO; Paasche, O				Bakke, J; Lie, O; Nesje, A; Dahl, SO; Paasche, O			Utilizing physical sediment variability in glacier-fed lakes for continuous glacier reconstructions during the Holocene, northern Folgefonna, western Norway	HOLOCENE												The maritime plateau glacier of northern Folgefonna in western Norway has a short (subdecadal) response time to climatic shifts, and is therefore well suited for reconstructing high-resolution glacier fluctuations. The reconstruction presented here is based on physical parameters of glaciolacustrine sediments retrieved from two glacier-fed lakes and a peat bog north of the ice cap. Bulk density and modelled glacier net mass balance for the last 200 years show a remarkably similar pattern, where maximum sediment yield lags the glacier net mass balance by similar to 10 years. The record of glacier variations has been transferred into an equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) variation curve. Glaciers respond primarily to changes in summer temperature and winter precipitation. At present there is a high correlation between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index and measured (since the early 1960s) net mass balance on maritime glaciers in western Norway (r = similar to 0.8). Reconstructed glacier variations from maritime western Norway are therefore considered indicative of the strength of the westerly airflow associated with NAO during the Holocene. The early phase of mid-Holocene glacier growth (5200 cal. yr BP) was characterized by gradual glacier expansion culminating in the first Subatlantic glacial event at 2300 cal. yr BP. The climate during the last 2200 years has favoured increased glacier activity at Folgefonna. High-amplitude shifts in ELA may be explained by unstable modes of the westerlies causing significant variability of winter precipitation. During the last 2000 years, Folgefonna expanded and decayed with significant decadal variability. During the latest period of the 'MediaevalWarm Epoch', Folgefonna advanced. The Neoglacial maximum, however, was reached during the 'Little Ice Age' at AD 1750 and AD 1870. The northern Folgefonna glacial record is compared to other Holocene glacier records in Scandinavia.					; Bakke, Jostein/AAI-1145-2020	Bakke, Jostein/0000-0001-6114-0400; Paasche, Oyvind/0000-0003-0329-9063													0959-6836	1477-0911				FEB	2005	15	2					161	176		10.1191/0959683605hl797rp	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683605hl797rp													WOS:000227733400001
J	Sayer, CD; Roberts, N				Sayer, CD; Roberts, N			Establishing realistic restoration targets for nutrient-enriched shallow lakes: linking diatom ecology and palaeoecology at the Attenborough Ponds, UK	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Eutrophication is a major problem for shallow lakes in the U.K. lowlands. Over the last few decades issues relating to the management and restoration of these lakes have come to the fore, including the need to develop methods for establishing realistic restoration targets. One group of lakes for which restoration is a key concern are the Attenborough Ponds in the English Midlands, an interconnected series of shallow, nutrient-enriched gravel-pit lakes. In November 1972, the highly polluted River Erewash was diverted into the Attenborough Ponds. To determine the ecological effects of this event and to establish restoration goals for this lake system, two complimentary studies were undertaken here; (i) monitoring of the ecology and sedimentary representation of diatom communities in a disturbed lake connected to the R. Erewash (Tween Pond: high nutrient concentrations, no submerged macrophytes) and a relatively undisturbed lake isolated from the R. Erewash (Clifton Pond: lower nutrient concentrations, abundant submerged macrophytes), and; (ii) examination of the sedimentary diatom record in a short sediment core collected from the chosen disturbed lake (Tween Pond). The species composition, seasonality, relative productivity and sedimentary representation of planktonic and periphytic diatom communities were very different in Tween and Clifton Ponds. In Tween Pond two major phases of planktonic diatom production/sedimentation were observed during March-May and July-September. By contrast, planktonic diatoms were restricted to a single spring peak in Clifton Pond and after May there was a switch to the dominance of periphytic diatoms associated with the development of submerged macrophytes. The 1972 diversion of the River Erewash was clearly reflected in the sedimentary diatom record from Tween Pond, by; (i) the abrupt shift to planktonic diatom dominance, and; (ii) increasing percentages of late summer-autumn associated planktonic diatom species. These changes suggest both significant nutrient enrichment and the switch from submerged macrophyte to phytoplankton dominance. Numerical matching of pre-1972 diatom assemblages with surface sediment assemblages in the gravel-pits using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and a squared chord distance measure revealed no close analogues. Nevertheless, similarities between; (i) percentages of different diatom habitat and seasonality groups, and; (ii) pre-1972 and contemporary macrophyte survey data suggested that Clifton Pond is probably a good pre-diversion analogue for habitat structure (e.g. macrophyte biomass, composition and architecture) and phenology (e.g. diatom and macrophyte seasonality) in the Ponds. The practical value of combining space-for-time substitution and palaeoecological approaches in restoration ecology studies of shallow lakes is discussed.																			0018-8158					APR	2001	448	1-3					117	142		10.1023/A:1017597221052	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017597221052													WOS:000169863400013
J	Grosbois, G; Mariash, H; Schneider, T; Rautio, M				Grosbois, Guillaume; Mariash, Heather; Schneider, Tobias; Rautio, Milla			Under-ice availability of phytoplankton lipids is key to freshwater zooplankton winter survival	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Shortening winter ice-cover duration in lakes highlights an urgent need for research focused on under-ice ecosystem dynamics and their contributions to whole-ecosystem processes. Low temperature, reduced light and consequent changes in autotrophic and heterotrophic resources alter the diet for long-lived consumers, with consequences on their metabolism in winter. We show in a survival experiment that the copepod Leptodiaptomus minutus in a boreal lake does not survive five months under the ice without food. We then report seasonal changes in phytoplankton, terrestrial and bacterial fatty acid (FA) biomarkers in seston and in four zooplankton species for an entire year. Phytoplankton FA were highly available in seston (2.6 mu g L-1) throughout the first month under the ice. Copepods accumulated them in high quantities (44.8 mu g mg dry weight(-1)), building lipid reserves that comprised up to 76% of body mass. Terrestrial and bacterial FA were accumulated only in low quantities (<2.5 mu g mg dry weight(-1)). The results highlight the importance of algal FA reserve accumulation for winter survival as a key ecological process in the annual life cycle of the freshwater plankton community with likely consequences to the overall annual production of aquatic FA for higher trophic levels and ultimately for human consumption.					; Grosbois, Guillaume/M-8097-2019	Mariash, Heather/0000-0003-2822-5917; Grosbois, Guillaume/0000-0002-1306-8528; 													2045-2322					SEP 14	2017	7								11543	10.1038/s41598-017-10956-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-10956-0								28912552					WOS:000410739000041

To study this process, we measured delta C-DIC and delta C-13 values of particulate organic carbon (POC) over an annual cycle in the permanently stratified Kyllaren fjord in Norway. A notable accumulation of respired DIC below the chemocline was evident from the substantially C-13-depleted DIC (ca. -19%). Especially in autumn to early spring, respired DIC from the deep anoxic water is mixed into the oxygenated surface water and the calculated respired DIC contribution to the total DIC pool was up to similar to 40% in early spring in the upper 2 m of the water column. At 4 m-depth, just below the chemocline, the respired DIC contribution reaches ca. 90% of the total DIC pool. Assimilation of the respired DIC seems to exert only a small effect on delta C-13(POC), which has an average delta C-13 value of -24%. The measured photoautotrophic fractionation (epsilon(p)) was low (< 10 parts per thousand) during the majority of the year. This is likely responsible for reducing the apparent impact of recycling of respired DIC on delta C-13(POC). However, in June 2002, photoautotrophic use of the 13C-depleted DIC is obvious from a C-13-depletion of POC (-33.7 parts per thousand) derived from a bloom of the protist Euglena sp.

Swimmer's itch control: Timely waterfowl brood relocation significantly reduces an avian schistosome population and human cases on recreational lakes	PLOS ONE												Swimmer's itch (SI) is a dermatitis in humans caused by cercariae of avian and mammalian schistosomes which emerge from infected snails on a daily basis. Mitigation methods for SI have long been sought with little success. Copper sulfate application to the water to kill the snail hosts is the historically employed method, but is localized, temporary, and harmful to many aquatic species. Here, we test an alternative method to control Trichobilharzia stagnicolae, a species well-known to cause SI in northern Michigan and elsewhere in North America. Summer relocation of broods of the only known vertebrate host, common merganser (Mergus merganser), greatly reduced snail infection prevalence the following year on two large, geographically separated lakes in northern Michigan. Subsequent years of host relocation achieved and maintained snail infection prevalence at similar to 0.05%, more than an order of magnitude lower than pre-intervention. A Before-After-Control-Intervention (BACI) study design using multiple-year snail infection data from two intervention lakes and three control lakes demonstrates that dramatic lake-wide reduction of an avian schistosome can be achieved and is not due to natural fluctuations in the parasite populations. The relevance of reducing snail infection prevalence is demonstrated by a large seven-year data set of SI incidence in swimmers at a high-use beach, which showed a substantial reduction in SI cases in two successive years after relocation began. In addition, data from another Michigan lake where vertebrate-host based intervention occurred in the 1980's are analyzed statistically and show a remarkably similar pattern of reduction in snail infection prevalence. Together, these results demonstrate a highly effective SI mitigation strategy that avoids the use of environmentally suspect chemicals and removes incentive for lethal host removal. Biologically, the results strongly suggest that T. stagnicolae is reliant on the yearly hatch of ducklings to maintain populations at high levels on a lake and that the role of migratory hosts in the spring and fall is much less significant.					; DeJong, Randall/KRO-4870-2024	DeJong, Randall/0000-0001-5660-9227; 													1932-6203					FEB 15	2024	19	2							e0288948	10.1371/journal.pone.0288948	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0288948								38359003					WOS:001164173200032

Between 2012 and 2023, we surveyed the number of Bar-headed Geese at Bande Lake and tracked 14 individuals to identify their migration routes and patterns. Our results revealed a remarkable 512% increase in the number of geese from 1,172 to 7,742 over the past 12 years. Satellite tracking highlighted a distinct migration route and pattern with departing from breeding sites on 16 October (t 7 day), stopover in the Qiangtang Lakes for 11 t 8 days, and arrival at the YarlungZangbo River Basin for wintering on 30 October (t 13 day). The migration covered a relatively short distance of 662 t 77 km and lasted approximately 14.6 t 6.7 days. The unique migration pattern and increasing breeding size suggests that the Bar-headed Geese breeding in Bande Lake represent a growing subpopulation distinct from other subpopulations. Giving their extended summering/wintering duration and significant population size, targeted conservation efforts remain critical for both Bande Lake and the Yarlung Tsangpo River Basin.																			1524-4695	1938-5390				FEB	2025	47	4							408															WOS:001522338400003

Surveys conducted in early 2009 revealed that red-finned blue-eye was present in four individual springs and that invasion of the spring complex by alien eastern gambusia was the most likely factor contributing to local extirpations. Athree-year project commenced in the same year, with the twin aims of investigating methods for removing gambusia from springs and relocating small populations of red-finned blue-eye to fish-free springs. Gambusia removal with rotenone has been successful in a trial spring at Edgbaston and aquatic invertebrates have not been adversely affected. From a total of seven relocation events conducted in the same period, red-finned blue-eye populations have persisted in three. The results indicate that gambusia removal and red-finned blue-eye relocation are both suitable methods for red-finned blue-eye conservation, and as the fish is both endangered and declining, these methods and other strategies such as captive breeding should be implemented to prevent species extinction.

Machine Learning Based Acoustic/IR Monitoring	JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION RESEARCH												Chiropean monitoring has become an important public concern given that wind turbines pose the threat of injury or death to bats through direct impact or barotraumas. Such monitoring therefore requires robust methodology to assess the local density, temporal activity, and diversity of bats. This work develops machine learning based monitoring approach' for nocturnal Hight activity of bats. it consists of Ultrasound Acoustic Monitoring System (LAMS) and thermal-Infrared Imaging Monitoring System (HMS), the former for identification of bat echolocation calls and the latter for assessing flight characteristics. Supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques were used for U AMS and 11MS; respectively. The proposed methodology was tested with real data collected during 2011 spring and fall migration around Lake Erie in Ohio.

Determination of the status of heavy metals in bodies of horses is important for two reasons. Firstly, it helps to assess the level of environmental contamination. Secondly, heavy metals can have considerable influence on animals living outdoors. The aim of the study has been to verify whether the level of Cr, Mn, Cu, Cd, Pb and Ni in the coat hair and cornified structures of hooves may differ between horses maintained alternately in a stable and on pasture and living outdoors all year long, with Polish Koniks from Mazury (the Masurian Lake District) taken as an example. Possible effects of the feeding season and age of horses were considered. In total, 35 Polish Konik horses were examined, either kept in a stable-pasture system in Popielno or outdoors in Wojnowo. Sixty-two samples of summer and winter coat hair, 28 samples of hoof horn, as well as 10 samples of pasture plants and water were analyzed. The data were elaborated with the use multi-factor analysis of variance, T-Tukey-Kramer test and Pearson's correlation. The results show that Polish Konik horses bred in Mazury have a low heavy metal concentration in the coat hair and hoof horn. The stable-pasture and outdoor maintenance systems hardly differentiate the element content, whereas the winter feeding results in an elevated concentration of the elements in the hair. Yearlings show higher Mn and Cd content than mares and foals at foot. The dam's impact on the heavy metal concentration in the hair and hoof horn in their foals is usually non-significant.

Single and multiple Kajak-type corers were used, and the meiofauna was defined as animals retained between sieves with 0.1- and 0.4-mm meshes. Total numbers of meiozoobenthos were 80,000-230,000 individuals/m2 in the profundal an 400,000-630,000 in the littoral. It consisted mainly of Nematoda, Cyclopoida, Harpacticoida, Ostracoda and Chironomidae. Other groups were Turbellaria, Rotatoria, Oligochaeta, Cladocera, Ephemeroptera, Ceratopogonidae, Oribatei, Hydrachnellae, Halacaridae and Tardigrada, but their contribution to total numbers was only 8% in the littoral and 6% in the profundal. Total biomasses (ash-free dry wt.) of meiozoobenthos were 0.1-0.3 and 0.6-0.8 g/m2 in the profundal and littoral, respectively. More than 95% of meiobenthic animals lived in the uppermost 2 cm of the sediment. Seasonal variation in total numbers was most pronounced in the littoral, and maximum abundances were reached in early autumn after a slight minimum in early summer. The ratio between numbers of meiofauna and macrofauna was 10-19:1 in the littoral and 41-52:1 in the profundal. The ratio between their biomasses was 0.5:1 in the littoral, 3:1 in the littoriprofundal and upper profundal and 2:1 in the deep profundal.																			0003-455X	1797-2450					1977	14	3					124	134																WOS:A1977EM50100002

Characterization and estimation of urban heat island at Toronto: impact of the choice of rural sites	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												In this study, the urban heat island of Toronto was characterized and estimated in order to examine the impact of the selection of rural sites on the estimation of urban heat island (UHI) intensity (a dagger T (u-r)). Three rural stations, King Smoke Tree (KST), Albion Hill, and Millgrove, were used for the analysis of UHI intensity for two urban stations, Toronto downtown (Toronto) and Toronto Pearson (Pearson) using data from 1970 to 2000. The UHI intensity was characterized as winter dominating and summer dominating, depending on the choice of the rural station. The analyses of annual and seasonal trends of a dagger T (u-r) suggested that urban heat island clearly appears in winter at both Toronto and Pearson. However, due to the mitigating effect on temperature from Lake Ontario, the estimated trend of UHI intensity was found to be less at Toronto compared to that at Pearson which has no direct lake effect. In terms of the impacts of the rural stations, for both KST and Millgrove, the trends in UHI intensity were found to be statistically significant and also were in good agreement with the estimates of UHI intensities reported for other large cities in the USA. Depending on the choice of the rural station, the estimated trend for the UHI intensity at Toronto ranges from 0.01A degrees C/decade to 0.02A degrees C/decade, and that at Pearson ranges from 0.03A degrees C/decade to 0.035A degrees C/decade during 1970-2000. From the analysis of the seasonal distribution of a dagger T (u-r), the UHI intensity was found to be higher at Toronto in winter than that at Pearson for all three rural stations. This was likely accounted for by the lower amount of anthropogenic heat flux at Pearson. Considering the results from the statistical analysis with respect to the geographic and surface features for each rural station, KST was suggested to be a better choice to estimate UHI intensity at Toronto compared to the other rural stations. The analysis from the current study suggests that the selection of a unique urban-rural pair to estimate UHI intensity for a city like Toronto is a critical task, as it will be for any city, and it is imperative to consider some key features such as the physiography, surface characteristics of the urban and rural stations, the climatology such as the trends in annual and seasonal variation of UHI with respect to the physical characteristics of the stations, and also more importantly the objectives of a particular study in the context of UHI effect.

Is Niagara Falls a barrier to gene flow in riverine fishes? A test using genome-wide SNP data from seven native species	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Since the early Holocene, fish population genetics in the Laurentian Great Lakes have been shaped by the dual influences of habitat structure and post-glacial dispersal. Riverscape genetics theory predicts that longitudinal habitat corridors and unidirectional downstream water-flow drive the downstream accumulation of genetic diversity, whereas post-glacial dispersal theory predicts that fish genetic diversity should decrease with increasing distance from glacial refugia. This study examines populations of seven native fish species codistributed above and below the 58 m high Niagara Falls - a hypothesized barrier to gene flow in aquatic species. A better understanding of Niagara Falls' role as a barrier to gene flow and dispersal is needed to identify drivers of Great Lakes genetic diversity and guide strategies to limit exotic species invasions. We used genome-wide SNPs and coalescent models to test whether populations are: (a) genetically distinct, consistent with the Niagara Falls barrier hypothesis; (b) more genetically diverse upstream, consistent with post-glacial expansion theory, or downstream, consistent with the riverscape habitat theory; and (c) have migrated either upstream or downstream past Niagara Falls. We found that genetic diversity is consistently greater below Niagara Falls and the falls are an effective barrier to migration, but two species have probably dispersed upstream past the falls after glacial retreat yet before opening of the Welland Canal. Models restricting migration to after opening of the Welland Canal were generally rejected. These results help explain how river habitat features affect aquatic species' genetic diversity and highlight the need to better understand post-glacial dispersal pathways.

J	ELLIOTT, JM				ELLIOTT, JM			GROWTH, SIZE, BIOMASS AND PRODUCTION OF YOUNG MIGRATORY TROUT SALMO-TRUTTA IN A LAKE DISTRICT STREAM, 1966-83	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												The objectives were to identify the chief factors affecting the growth of 1st yr trout in 17 year-classes and to develop a population dynamics model as part of a larger investigation on migratory trout, S. trutta L., in Black Brows Beck. Mean size and total biomass of alevins at the start of the growth period varied considerably between year-classes and were chiefly determined by egg weight and abundance. Mean size and growth rate of 1st yr trout varied considerably between year-classes, were not related to egg or alevin density and were thus not density-dependent. Water temperature and alevin weight were the chief factors affecting growth; food was not a limiting factor in most year-classes. Individual variation around mean size was inversely related to initial density of eggs or alevins and was thus density-dependent. It was low for alevins, increased markedly during the 1st mo. of growth and remained fairly constant within each year-class during spring and summer. Biomass and production were related to egg or alevin density by a dome-shaped curve but were also affected by variations in growth rate, especially towards the end of the summer. Their large variation between year-classes was determined by density-dependent mortality and to a lesser extent by density-independent growth. Egg or alevin density, temperature, time and alevin weight were thus the chief factors affecting the population dynamics of 1st yr trout and these were collated in a preliminary model that was a good fit to the data in all year classes except those for the dry summers of 1969, 1976 and 1983. The problem of predicting catastrophic droughts and their effects on the population dynamics of the trout cannot be resolved in an investigation over only 18 yr and illustrates the need for even longer analyses before populations can be modeled realistically.																			0021-8790	1365-2656					1984	53	3					979	994		10.2307/4672	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4672													WOS:A1984TN16000020

A 6-month field study from two disparate shallow eutrophic lakes could partly reveal these issues by analysing seasonal variations of biodegradation and phytoremediation in the sediment. This paper describes the relationship between oxidation reduction potential, temperature, microbial activity and phytoremediation in nitrogen cycling by calculation degradative index of dissolved organic nitrogen and amino acid decomposition. The index was being positive in winter and negative in summer while closely positive correlated with biodegradation. Our analysis revealed that rather than anoxic condition, biomass is the primary factor to dissolved organic nitrogen distribution and decomposition. Some major amino acids statistics also confirm the above view. The comparisons of organic nitrogen and amino acid in abundance and seasons in situ provides that demonstrated plants cue important for nitrogen removal by their roots adsorption and immobilization. In conclusion, enhanced microbial activity and phytoremediation with the seasons will reduce the endogenous nitrogen loadings by the coupled mineralization and diagenetic process.																			2267-1242						2018	38								01027	10.1051/e3sconf/20183801027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/20183801027													WOS:000476915900024

Thermal dependence of size-at-hatch in the lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) embryos incubated at low temperatures have a longer incubation period and hatch at a significantly greater size than those incubated at warmer temperatures. We examined hatch timing and morphological characteristics for whitefish embryos reared under different constant and varying temperatures to determine whether the thermal dependence of hatching size reflects differences in their development stage. Our results show that lake whitefish embryos hatch at different temperature-dependent developmental stages, and this is the dominant factor affecting size-at-hatch. The term "heterograde" is proposed for the thermal dependence of hatching stage to differentiate it from hatching that occurs at a fixed developmental stage. A method to quantify this effect is given using a ratio that describes the difference in relative development at hatching between different viable constant incubation temperatures. Heterograde hatching is proposed as a possible mechanism to synchronize the timing of hatch to the break-up of winter ice cover despite variability in the date of spawning and in the onset of spring break-up.

The 250 km long Lake Melville spans 2100 km2 and is the largest estuary of Labrador (northeastern Canada). This sub-arctic fjard hosts freshwater, anadromous, and marine fishes on which depend marine mammals and sea-birds, but also coastal communities. Yet, how different fish species and life stages use the estuary as a habitat, in particular the importance of the low salinity surface layer for the development of fish larvae, remains unknown. By pairing seasonal hydroacoustic surveys conducted in summers 2018-2019 and winters 2019-2020 with net sampling and environmental DNA (eDNA) analyses, we test the hypothesis that the strong water stratification prevailing in upper Lake Melville provides a nursery for early life stages of fish, where they are protected from their predators. Ichthyoplankton aggregated just above and at the pycnocline, in the low salinity surface layer down to 25 m. Most adult pelagic fish occupied the bottom waters below the sharp pycnocline, although some ventured in the low salinity surface layer. Ten species of adult fish were captured in gill and fyke nets and 53 species were detected with eDNA. Larvae of rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) were ubiquitous in the surface layer in July and August and represented 100% of the ichthyoplankton assemblage sampled during these months. No fish larvae were detected in winter (February). We conclude that the low salinity surface layer provides a refuge for rainbow smelt larvae, a key forage species in the estuary. This study provides baseline information from which to assess future changes in biodiversity and distribution of fish in the Lake Melville estuary. It further supports the use of eDNA as a complementary tool for monitoring fish diversity in sub-arctic estuaries.

The determination of the directions and rate of changes in air and water temperatures involved the application of linear regression. Its significance was verified by means of F test at a level of 0.05. The rate of increase in air temperature in the western part of the Polish Lowland was determined to average 0.32 C.10 years-1 and decrease towards its eastern part to 0.22 C.10 years-1. In the case of rivers, the mean increase in water temperature varied from 0.26 C.10 years-1 in the western part to 0.20 C.10 years-1 in the eastern part, and for lake waters, from 0.30 to 0.15 C.10 years-1. Increase in water temperature in particular months throughout the analysed period was much more variable. Its highest increase occurred in May and ranged in lakes from 3.1 to 3.9 C, and in rivers from 1.9 to 2.6 C. The lowest increases in water temperature (usually from 0.1 to 1.0 C) were observed in autumn and winter months, whereas water temperature in some lakes showed a negative tendency in winter months. In the case of Lake Haticza, in November it decreased during the analysed period by 1.3 C. During longer periods such as a year or half-year, an evident increase was found to occur in air and inland water temperature. During shorter month-long periods, the increase is not always so evident, and sometimes even a decrease in temperature is observed.

Mixing of shallow and deep groundwater as indicated by the chemistry and age of karstic springs	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Large karstic springs in east-central Florida, USA were studied using multi-tracer and geochemical modeling techniques to better understand groundwater flow paths and mixing of shallow and deep groundwater. Spring water types included Ca-HCO3 (six), Na-Cl (four), and mixed (one). The evolution of water chemistry for CaHCO3 spring waters was modeled by reactions of rainwater with soil organic matter, calcite, and dolomite under oxic conditions. The Na-Cl and mixed-type springs were modeled by reactions of either rainwater or Upper Floridan aquifer water with soil organic matter, calcite, and dolomite under oxic conditions and mixed with varying proportions of saline Lower Floridan aquifer water, which represented 4-53% of the total spring discharge. Multiple-tracer data-chlorofluorocarbon CFC-113, tritium (H-3), helium-3 (He-3(trit)), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6)-for four Ca-HCO3 spring waters were consistent with binary mixing curves representing water recharged during 1980 or 1990 mixing with an older (recharged before 1940) tracer-free component. Young-water mixing fractions ranged from 0.3 to 0.7. Tracer concentration data for two Na-Cl spring waters appear to be consistent with binary mixtures of 1990 water with older water recharged in 1965 or 1975. Nitrate-N concentrations are inversely related to apparent ages of spring waters, which indicated that elevated nitrate-N concentrations were likely contributed from recent recharge.																			1431-2174					JUN	2006	14	5					827	847		10.1007/s10040-005-0478-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-005-0478-x													WOS:000239459300018

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs) and the currently- used pesticide lindane were measured in precipitation and ambient air samples. Overall the two networks sampling and analytical methods agreed well in their results of deposition ( wet and dry particulate). Lindane concentrations between the two networks agreed well in the air samples while too few precipitation samples could be compared to conclude on agreement. The lindane seasonal pro. le with a peak in spring - early summer was consistent with previous results pointing to the continued use of this pesticide in 2002 - 2003 in Canada. Annual lindane wet depositions were comparable between the two network methodologies. PAHs concentrations in precipitation and in gas phase agreed well while there was a discrepancy for particulate PAHs in air. This study confirmed that the use of data from the two regional POPs monitoring networks for hemispherical modelling studies is warranted.																			1464-0325						2006	8	4					465	471		10.1039/b517112a	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b517112a								16604236					WOS:000236680800005

Metatranscriptomic analysis reveals dissimilarity in viral community activity between an ice-free and ice-covered winter in Lake Erie	MSYSTEMS												Winter is a relatively under-studied season in freshwater ecology. The paucity of wintertime surveys has led to a lack of knowledge regarding microbial community activity during the winter in Lake Erie, a North American Great Lake. Viruses shape microbial communities and regulate biogeochemical cycles by acting as top-down controls, yet very few efforts have been made to examine active virus populations during the winter in Lake Erie. Furthermore, climate change-driven declines in seasonal ice cover have been shown to influence microbial community structure, but no studies have compared viral community activity between different ice cover conditions. We surveyed surface water metatranscriptomes for viral hallmark genes as a proxy for active virus populations and compared activity metrics between ice-covered and ice-free conditions from two sampled winters. Transcriptionally active viral communities were detected in both winters, spanning diverse phylogenetic clades of putative bacteriophage (Caudoviricetes), giant viruses (Nucleocytoviricota, or NCLDV), and RNA viruses (Orthornavirae). However, viral community activity metrics revealed pronounced differences between the ice-covered and ice-free winters. Viral community composition was distinct between winters and viral hallmark gene richness was reduced in the ice-covered relative to the ice-free conditions. In addition, the observed differences in viral communities correlated with microbial community activity metrics. Overall, these findings contribute to our understanding of the viral populations that are active during the winter in Lake Erie and suggest that viral community activity may be associated with ice cover extent.IMPORTANCEAs seasonal ice cover is projected to become increasingly rare on large temperate lakes, there is a need to understand how microbial communities might respond to changing ice conditions. Although it is widely recognized that viruses impact microbial community structure and function, there is little known regarding wintertime viral activity or the relationship between viral activity and ice cover extent. Our metatranscriptomic analyses indicated that viruses were transcriptionally active in the winter surface waters of Lake Erie. These findings also expanded the known diversity of viral lineages in the Great Lakes. Notably, viral community activity metrics were significantly different between the two sampled winters. The pronounced differences we observed in active viral communities between the ice-covered and ice-free samples merit further research regarding how viral communities will function in future, potentially ice-free, freshwater systems.

Community structure of Diplostomum spp. (Digenea: Diplostomidae) in eyes of fish: Main determinants and potential interspecific interactions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY												Parasite communities in freshwater fish vary annually and seasonally and can be influenced by the length, age, sex and phylogeny of hosts, and by associations among parasite species. We assessed the influence of these factors in species of Diplostomum in the eyes of 828 fish in 20 different species collected in a single lake in early summer or autumn over a 5 year interval. Strong negative associations were found between five pairs of Diplostomum spp. and associations were strongest among abundant species. Most interspecific associations occurred among species inhabiting the lens, suggesting competitive interactions. However, the strongest association occurred between two Diplostomum spp. that inhabit different tissues (i.e., the vitreous humour and lens), indicating processes other than direct competition. Seasonal variation was small compared with inter-annual variation. Infection intensities were high in 2006 and decreased dramatically in 2010 and 2011. Infracommunity composition and structure showed no clear correspondence to the ecology or phylogeny of host species. Host length and age, but not sex, had significant effects on the structure of Diplostomum infracommunities in lenses. However, a significant amount of variance in lens infracommunities could not be explained, indicating the potential importance of other factors such as resistance or exposure in determining infracommunity structure.

J	Zhang, YQ; Zhou, LZ; Cheng, L; Song, YW				Zhang, Yiqun; Zhou, Lizhi; Cheng, Lei; Song, Yunwei			Water level management plan based on the ecological demands of wintering waterbirds at Shengjin Lake	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												A reasonable hydrological regime is of great significance for ecosystem services and wildlife habitat management in river-connected lakes. Shengjin Lake is a Ramsar site with international importance for wintering migratory waterbirds. Since the Huangpen River sluice began operations, the lake's hydrological rhythm was changed. We investigated the effect of different hydrological conditions under water level control on the abundance of waterbird foraging guilds using habitat as an intermediary. First, linear models of 12 years dataset (2008-2019) based on waterbird surveys and satellite remote sensing images were constructed to analyse the relationship between habitat area and water level. Then, generalized linear mixed models were used to explore the effects of habitat area on abundance in different waterbird foraging guilds. Finally, the abundance of each type of waterbird guild was predicted at intervals of 0.10 m at the water level. Overall, 60% of the abundance of waterbird foraging guilds could be explained by water level with habitat as an intermediary, and this was affected by the rate of change of their preferred habitat area with water level increase. When the water level was less than 10.2 m, the meadow area was negatively correlated with the D80 water level (average water level of 71-80 days before waterbirds wintering), which was the main factor that affected tuber foragers and seed foragers/dabbling waterbirds. The abundance of food for these herbivorous waterbirds during the middle wintering was affected by the exposed tidal flat area in October, which provided suitable conditions for the secondary growth of grass. Starting from 10.20 m, waterbird abundance rapidly reduced with a sharply increasing water area, which was influenced by artificial sluice control and reduced rainfall. Therefore, management should be focused on appropriately lowering the water level in the early wintering period. Considering the suitable habitat area, hysteresis of meadow growth, and residential water demand, a water level control scheme was recommended to be 8.65-9.50 m in the early wintering period, 8.11-8.80 m in the middle wintering period, and 8.09-9.40 m in the late wintering period. The results of this study will help to promote the reasonable water level control for the lakes as the wintering grounds of migratory waterbirds. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Taylor, JE; Monamy, V; Fox, BJ				Taylor, JE; Monamy, V; Fox, BJ			Flowering of Xanthorrhoea fulva: the effect of fire and clipping	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Xanthorrhoea fulva (A.Lee) Bedford is a dominant plant of wet heath at Myall Lakes National Park, New South Wales, Australia. As for many other members of the genus, fire is the main stimulus for flowering of X. fulva. The stimulus to flowering provided by fire and by crown removal (clipping) of X. fulva was compared in two different seasons and for two different between-fire intervals. The percentage of X. fulva crowns flowering was greater following: (i) summer disturbance when compared with winter disturbance; (ii) short between-fire intervals (3.75 or 5.25 years) when compared with long between-fire intervals (9.3 or 16.9 years); and (iii) burning when compared with clipping. This demonstrates that the stimulus to floral induction in X. fulva is a combination of a seasonal component and crown removal, a component related to the interval since the last fire, and perhaps some other factor(s) not tested for in this study. This variation in flowering response of X. fulva shows the importance of considering immediate and historic characteristics of fire and other disturbances when management decisions are being made.

Vegetation and crawling invertebrate abundance were sampled in each habitat. Houbara Bustards showed seasonally changing habitat preferences that appeared to be influenced primarily by vegetation phenology, abundance and cover. More densely vegetated areas (10-17% cover) were preferred. Seasonal and inter-habitat variations in invertebrate numbers were not reflected in differential habitat use by Houbara Bustards. The highest selection ratio for a single habitat (dry lakes) occurred in summer, coinciding with the fruiting of Shafallah Capparis spinosa. Selectivity of habitats was least in spring, when green vegetation was most widespread. Changes in Houbara Bustard habitat preferences in response to marked seasonal changes in habitats brought about by well-defined patterns of rainfall indicate that studies of habitat selection should consider the entire annual cycle. The importance of vegetative cover and the sensitivity of Houbara Bustards to human disturbance suggest that reserves set aside for Houbara Bustards should be extensive, diverse and largely free of livestock, human occupation and its associated disturbances.					van Heezik, Yolanda/I-2744-2019; Seddon, Philip/G-8659-2011														0019-1019					APR	1999	141	2					208	215																WOS:000079776800004

To address the potential impact of climate- and permafrost-induced changes in surface hydrological processes in the SAYR, the hydrological transitions and water balance of thermokarst lakes were characterized on large scales during three years using stable isotope method. Spatial and seasonal deviations in hydrological processes of thermokarst lakes were remarkable. Calculations of evaporation-to-inflow (E/I) ratios based on an isotope-mass balance model revealed substantial evaporation for all thermokarst lakes during June due to the control of climate conditions and limited input water. Substantial feeds from summer/fall rain and permafrost meltwater resulted in lower evaporation and positive water balance of lakes during July, August, September, and October. Based on the relationship between lake-specific input water isotope compositions (delta(I)) and annual average isotope value of precipitation (delta(P)), the recharge patterns of thermokarst lakes in the SAYR were classified: supra-permafrost water/rainfall-dominated lakes were mainly concentrated during June and October regardless of spatial divergences, and summer precipitation/permafrost thaw-dominated lakes are popular during July and August. Qualitatively, seasonal diversities in the water balance of thermokarst lakes are combinatively controlled by air temperature, precipitation regimes, permafrost degradation in the SAYR. Lastly, the future hydrological trajectories of thermokarst lakes are expected under climatic warming and permafrost degradation. This study serves as an important contribution for understanding future hydrological changes and allocation of water resources on the QTP, as well as an indication of permafrost degradation under climate warming.

The present study focuses on the seasonal influence on the vulnerability of urban water in Guwahati, the largest city in North-eastern India, through examining the concurrence of seven PPCPs, five viruses, faecal bacteria and nine metals in surface waters during monsoon (Summer-July 2017) and pre-monsoon (Winter-March 2018). Surface water sampling was carried out at different locations of the Brahmaputra River, its tributary Bharalu River (an unlined urban drain), and Dipor Bill Lake (Ramsar-recognized wetland). Both PPCPs and viruses were at high concentrations (e.g. up to 970 ng L-1 caffeine, 2.5 x 10(3) copies mL(-1) pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV)) at the confluence points of urban drains and the river, while they were mostly undetectable at both upstream and downstream locations, implying strong self-purification ability of the river. All the analysed PPCPs and viruses were at much higher concentrations during pre-monsoon i.e., winter than during monsoon, implying heavy dilution and temperature effect during the monsoon. Overall, PPCPs and viruses were more correlated in monsoon but the risk quotient in the urban tributary was higher in pre-monsoon (e.g. 5061 in pre-monsoon and 1515 in monsoon for caffeine). PMMoV was found to be an excellent faecal pollution indicator due to its prevalence, detectability and specificity in all seasons. Overall, the seasonal fluctuations of the non-enveloped virusesmonitored in this study is likely to be relevant for SARS-CoV-2. We contribute to address the literature scarcity pertaining to seasonal variations in the prevalence of viruses and their concurrences with contaminants of emerging concern.					; Keisuke, Kuroda/AAC-5817-2022; BARCELO, DAMIA/O-4558-2016; kumar, manish/KIE-1953-2024	Kuroda, Keisuke/0000-0001-5110-8968; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				MAR 20	2022	813								152282	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.152282	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.152282		JAN 2022						34902398					WOS:000743237800014

Here, the reproductive biology of nine freshwater mussel species (Unionidae) found in Poyang Lake, Jiangxi province, China was studied. Sex ratios were not significantly different from 1:1 in eight of the nine species examined. The minimum size and age of sexual maturity (0.2-5.6yr for males and 0.3-5.9yr for females) and of females first becoming gravid (0.6-8.9yr) varied among species. Brooding seasons for glochidia varied among species, but seven of the nine species examined brooded glochidia through the spring and summer. In all species, high frequencies (mean 87.5%) were found to be gravid during their peak brooding period. Fecundity was positively correlated with shell length in the five species in which this was examined. Mean annual fecundity showed wide interspecific variation, ranging from 7,800 to 328,000 propagules/mussel. The findings of this study have implications for the ecology and conservation of unionid species in China and contributes to knowledge of the evolution of reproductive and life history characters of the Unionidae.

Increases in roadways and deicer use are now salinizing fresh waters, degrading habitat for aquatic organisms, and impacting large supplies of drinking water for humans throughout the region. We observed chloride concentrations of up to 25% of the concentration of seawater in streams of Maryland, New York, and New Hampshire during winters, and chloride concentrations remaining up to 100 times greater than unimpacted forest streams during summers. Mean annual chloride concentration increased as a function of impervious surface and exceeded tolerance for freshwater life in suburban and urban watersheds. our analysis shows that if salinity were to continue to increase at its present rate due to changes in impervious surface coverage and current management practices, many surface waters in the northeastern United States would not be potable for human consumption and would become toxic to freshwater life within the next century.					; Band, Lawrence/AAC-8992-2019; Kaushal, Sujay/G-1062-2013; Belt, Kenneth/AAI-6630-2020	Belt, Kenneth/0000-0002-4067-1541; Kelly, Victoria/0000-0003-3418-9211; Groffman, Peter/0000-0001-8371-6255; Band, Lawrence/0000-0003-0461-0503; 													0027-8424	1091-6490				SEP 20	2005	102	38					13517	13520		10.1073/pnas.0506414102	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0506414102								16157871					WOS:000232115100031

Coherent late-Holocene climate-driven shifts in the structure of three Rocky Mountain lakes	HOLOCENE												Large-scale atmospheric pressure centers, such as the Aleutian and Icelandic Low, have a demonstrated relationship with physical lake characteristics in contemporary monitoring studies, but the responses to these phenomena are rarely observed in lake records. We observe coherent changes in the stratification patterns of three deep (>30 m) lakes inferred from fossil diatom assemblages as a response to shifts in the location and intensity of the Aleutian Low and compare these changes with similar long-term changes observed in the delta O-18 record from the Yukon. Specifically, these records indicate that between 3.2 and 1.4 ka, the Aleutian Low shifted westward, resulting in an increased frequency of storm tracks across the Pacific Northwest during winter and spring. This change in atmospheric circulation ultimately produced deeper mixing in the upper waters of these three lake systems. Enhanced stratification between 4.5 and 3.3 ka and from 1.3 ka to present suggests a strengthened Aleutian Low and more meridional circulation.

J	Kristiansen, H; Doving, KB				Kristiansen, H; Doving, KB			The migration of spawning stocks of grayling Thymallus thymallus, in Lake Mjosa, Norway	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												The migration of grayling was studied in Lake Mjosa and 13 of its tributaries in which grayling spawn. The study demonstrate that grayling spawn in creeks in May/June and leave for Lake Mjosa shortly after spawning to return the next spring. Once mature, the grayling spawn every year. Grayling mix in the lake and are found at a mean distance of 11.9 km from the estuary of their spawning creek in September. Grayling embryos hatch in June and the juveniles stay in the tributaries until September/October. Grayling spend the winter months in the lake. Out of 1599 grayling tagged in tributaries during the spawning season, 240 of 284 recaptures (84.5 %) were made in subsequent spawning seasons in the same tributary in which they were first tagged. Forty-four grayling were recaptured in adjacent tributaries. These results demonstrate that, despite the fact that all grayling leave the tributaries and mix in the lake, there is a high precision of homing. It is suggested that the grayling population in lake Mjosa is composed of stocks using specific tributaries for spawning.																			0378-1909					SEP	1996	47	1					43	50		10.1007/BF00002378	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00002378													WOS:A1996VB08200004

MILD WEATHER IN EUROPE The Winter of 2013-14 in the Context of a Warming World	BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												The winter of 2013-14 had unusual weather in many parts of the world. Here we analyze the cold extremes that were widely reported in North America and the lack of cold extremes in western Europe. We perform a statistical analysis of cold extremes at two representative stations in these areas: Chicago, Illinois, and De Bilt, the Netherlands. This shows that the lowest minimum temperature of the winter was not very unusual in Chicago, even in the current warmer climate. Around 1950 it would have been completely normal. The same holds for multiday cold periods. Only the whole winter temperature was unusual, with a return time larger than 25 years. In the Netherlands, the opposite holds: the absence of any cold waves was highly unusual even now, and would have been extremely improbable halfway through the previous century. These results are representative of other stations in the regions. The difference is due to the skewness of the temperature distribution. In both locations, cold extremes are more likely than equally large warm extremes in winter. Severe cold outbreaks and cold winters, like the winter of 2013-14 in the Great Lakes area, are therefore not evidence against global warming: they will keep on occurring, even if they become less frequent. The absence of cold weather as observed in the Netherlands is a strong signal of a warming trend, as this would have been statistically extremely improbable in the 1950s.					van Oldenborgh, Geert/A-4176-2011; Allen, Myles/A-5172-2012; Haarsma, Reindert/D-1803-2013	Haarsma, Rein/0000-0001-7171-2687; 													0003-0007	1520-0477				MAY	2015	96	5					707	714		10.1175/BAMS-D-14-00036.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-14-00036.1													WOS:000356870000001
J	JENKIN, PM				JENKIN, PM			TEMPERATURE, HYDROCHEMISTRY AND PLANKTON IN WICKEN BRICKPITS, 1930-1931	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Temperature, selected chemical constituents and plankton were analyzed from 3 depths, fortnightly, by day and occasionally by night, in 2 flooded brickpits, between May, 1930 and Aug., 1931. Br [Brickpond a] was 3.3 m deep, with clear water and little weed; III [Brickpond b] was only 1.8 m deep, with thick submerged weed, more sheltered than Br and becoming eutrophic. Neither had direct inflow nor outlet. Both conformed to the 2nd order for dimictic lakes, with summer and winter stratifications, leading for varying periods, to stagnation marked by pH between 6.6 and 7.2 and O2 much depleted or absent at the bottom. During stagnation, release of SiO2, soluble inorganic phosphate-P, ammonium ions and bases from the bottom was shown by sampling water close to the mud. This finding preceded the definition of redox potential by others. Therimistor temperature measurements, used for the first time, showed comparable summer gradients in both ponds: on windy days these were usually sigmoid, with discontinuity at various depths, or else nearly isothermal; on calm days, they were exponential, when transmission of heat, from surface to bottom, was apparently due to radiation alone, without water circulation. Stablility was then high. Diatoms were abundant in both ponds; but planktonic Rotifera and Crustacea differed in the two, apart from Diaptomus gracilis, which was dominant in both.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1982	97	1					37	61		10.1007/BF00014958	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00014958													WOS:A1982PS96500005

Surface morphology of caldera-forming eruption deposits revealed by lidar mapping of Crater Lake National Park, Oregon - Implications for deposition and surface modification	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Large explosive eruptions of silicic magma can produce widespread pumice fall, extensive ignimbrite sheets, and collapse calderas. The surfaces of voluminous ignimbrites are rarely preserved or documented because most terrestrial examples are heavily vegetated, or severely modified by post-depositional processes. Much research addresses the internal sedimentary characteristics, flow processes, and depositional mechanisms of ignimbrites, however, surface features of ignimbrites are less well documented and understood, except for comparatively small-volume deposits of historical eruptions. The similar to 7700 calendar year B.P. climactic eruption of Mount Manama, USA, vented similar to 50 km(3) of magma, deposited first as rhyodadte pumice fall and then as a zoned rhyodacite-to-andesite ignimbrite as Crater Lake caldera collapsed. Lidar collected during summer 2010 reveals the remarkably well-preserved surface of the Manama ignimbrite and related deposits surrounding Crater Lake caldera in unprecedented detail despite forest cover. The +/- 1 m lateral and +/- 4 cm vertical resolution lidar allows surface morphologies to be classified. Surface morphologies are created by internal depositional processes and can point to the processes at work when pyroclastic flows come to rest. We describe nine surface features including furrow -ridge sets and wedge-shaped mounds in pumice fall eroded by high-energy pyroclastic surges, flow-parallel ridges that record the passage of multiple pyroclastic flows, perched benches of marginal deposits stranded by more-mobile pyroclastic-flow cores, hummocks of dense clasts interpreted as lag deposit, transverse ridges that mark the compression and imbrication of flows as they came to rest, scarps indicating ignimbrite remobilization, fields of closely spaced pits caused by phreatic explosions, fractures and cracks due to extensional processes resulting from ignimbrite volume loss, and stream channels eroded in the newly formed surface. The nine morphologies presented here illustrate a dynamic depositional environment that varied spatially and with time during the eruption, and show that multiple processes modified the ignimbrite after deposition, both during and after the eruption.

Variability, Seasonality, and Persistence of Fecal Coliform Bacteria in a Cold-Region, Urban Stream	JOURNAL OF COLD REGIONS ENGINEERING												Fecal coliform (FC) analyses were conducted on weekly water samples collected from a single watershed over a 2-year period in Anchorage, Alaska. Although peak FC concentrations (>100 FC/100 mL) were observed primarily during the warmer months, lower FC levels (>20 FC/100 mL) could be observed throughout the year in the urbanized portion of the watershed. Median annual FC counts ranged from 3 FC/100 mL at an undeveloped site to 49 FC/100 mL at one of the urbanized sites. Median FC concentrations were found to be significantly higher in the summer compared to the winter at two locations directly downstream from a lake (p=0.011 and 0.029), but not at the sites upstream or distant from the lake. FC-discharge relationships indicated a significant negative correlation between FC concentration and discharge at two sites (p=0.030 and 0.035) and no significant correlation at the remaining three sites. In total, the results indicated that the water quality was impacted not only by peakwarm season loading events, but also by chronic low-level loading throughout the year.

In 1986 and 1987, different densities of white perch and yellow perch were stocked into cages in the western basin of Lake Erie and their growth responses determined. Fish were weighed and measured pre- and post-stocking. In 1986 when fish were food-limited, individual growth of both species were negatively affected by increased total fish density; yellow perch to a greater extent. In 1987, experiments were carried out later in the year at lower temperatures. Yellow perch were shown to feed and continue to grow at lower water temperatures than white perch. We conclude that competition in summer may be mitigated in the fall because of differences in thermal optima between these two species.																			0018-8158					MAR 19	1993	254	2					119	123		10.1007/BF00014316	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00014316													WOS:A1993KZ41400008
J	Ruggiero, A; Solimini, AG; Carchini, G				Ruggiero, A; Solimini, AG; Carchini, G			Nutrient and chlorophyll a temporal patterns in eutrophic mountain ponds with contrasting macrophyte coverage	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Conference on Limnology of Shallow Lakes	MAY 25-30, 2002	BALATONFURED, HUNGARY	Veszprem Univ, Acad Sci & Dept Limonol, Balaton Linmol Inst Hungarian				In shallow lakes, macrophytes have important effects on food webs, community structure and nutrient dynamics. For this reason they play a significant role in the restoration of degraded systems. Particularly when present with large coverage, they establish mechanisms favoring low phytoplankton biomass and a decrease of nutrient concentration in the water column. Even if these effects are documented from a number of systems, little evidence comes from shallow mountain lakes. In this study, we report temporal patterns of phytoplanktonic chlorophyll a and nutrient concentration in six eutrophic mountain ponds showing contrasting macrophyte coverage. Six ponds, situated in the Italian Apennines at altitudes ranging from 4164 to 1604 m, were monitored from March to November 1997. Four subsurface water samples were collected at each pond on every visit and analysed for chlorophyll a and nutrients following standard methods. Ponds were divided into two groups: vegetated (VP) and unvegetated (UP) according to their summer macrophyte coverage (respectively > 30% and < 30% of pond area). A nested ANOVA was used to detect macrophyte coverage, season and date (nested within season) effect on phytoplanktonic chlorophyll a concentration, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP). Chlorophyll a was affected by coverage (P < 0.01) and by season (P < 0.05). In both groups chlorophyll a concentration increased from spring to summer, but differences were higher in UP than in VP. DIN was affected by coverage and season but temporal pattern was not consistent among UP and VP (interaction among coverage and season was significant, P < 0.01). SRP was not affected by coverage (P = 0.158) and season (P = 0.169). Our results on mountain ponds are consistent with those of similar lowland systems. We conclude that managing the presence of macrophytes can be an effective tool for the restoration of eutrophic shallow lakes also in mountain areas.

A total of 14 parameters, commonly used for quality characterization (pH, temperature. turbidity dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, chloride, BOD5, ammonia, nitrate, total phosphorus, orthophosphate, fecal coliforms, fecal streptococci and chlorophyll "a") were measured in samples collected monthly during two years at 30 cm depth from litoral and limnetic zones. Principal components analysis showed that water typology was defined by 9 variables grouped in two principal factors, related with algae biomass and with sanitary state/eutrophication level. Redundant parameters were discarded from those sets highly correlated with each factor and other original variable, preserving those with easier and economic techniques. Reducing variable numbers from 14 to 7 (fecal colifonns, turbidity, orthophosphate, nitrate, dissolved oxygen, BOD5, pH) and remaking the principal components analysis neither altered the definition of both principal factors nor reduced information about internal ecosystem dynamics.

Bernhart; Renaut, Robin W.; Jones, Brian			Geothermal diatoms: a comparative study of floras in hot spring systems of Iceland, New Zealand, and Kenya	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Diatom floras were examined from geothermal environments in three contrasting tectonic settings. These included subduction-related acid and alkaline springs in New Zealand; alkaline springs along a divergent plate boundary on Iceland; and alkaline springs in the Kenya Rift. These shallow (< 1 cm) aquatic environments vary considerably (e.g., temperature: 21.3-99 degrees C; pH: 2.1-9.65; 56.41-643 mg l(-1) SiO(2)). Diatoms form an important component of geothermal floras at temperatures of < 45 degrees C. The floras from New Zealand are distinguished by the common occurrence of Pinnularia. Icelandic springs have a variety of Fragilariaceae. Navicula and Anomoeoneis are most common in the Kenyan springs. Statistical analyses suggest that the diatoms cluster into seven major groups. The most common taxa include: Achnanthidium exiguum v. heterovalvum (Kras.) Czarn., Anomoeoneis sphaerophora (Ehrenb.) Pfitz, Brachysira brebissonii f. thermalis Grun., Caloneis bacillum (Grun.)

In this study we present a sediment record from the coastal lake Groenvlei located in the southern Cape region which is part of South Africa's year-round rainfall zone. In order to improve the understanding of palaeoenvironmental changes in this region, we provide a high resolution multi-proxy data set derived from geochemical, mineralogical, isotopic and granulometric analyses. The age-depth model is based on C-14 and Pb-210 dating and reveals a basal age of 4210 (+200)/(-120) cal BP. Differences in the mineralogical composition of deposited carbonates reflect changes in the past lake water chemistry, probably caused by variations in both sea level and climate. Compared to the present, mostly drier conditions and a greater marine influence due to a higher sea level are inferred for the period between 4210 and 2710 cal BP. However, the record also indicates the occurrence of short humid phases during this time, which were probably associated with heavy rainfall events. A transition layer was deposited between 2710 and 1210 cal BP, probably as a result of reworking of sediment. During this time, the lake passed through a major change finally turning into a freshwater system from at least 1210 cal BP until the present. Our data indicate that the marine influence on the lake decreased due to a lower sea level and climate became generally more humid after 1210 cal BP probably resulting in a greater lake-internal and-external bioproductivity. Based on a comparison with other palaeoenvironmental studies from South Africa, our record suggests a prevailing winter rainfall seasonality at the southern Cape coast between 4210 and 2710 cal BP and a stronger influence of summer rainfall from 1210 cal BP onwards.

Hiidenvesi, the spring biomass maximum of cladoceran zooplankton is missing and the highest biomass takes place in July-August. The factors behind the delayed biomass peak were studied in four different basins of the lake with concomitant data on cladocerans assemblages, density of the predatory cladoceran Leptodora kindti and food composition of fish. In all the basins, the abundance of Leptodora peaked in June, being highest (up to 800 ind. m(-3)) in the two most shallow basins (max depth < 4 m). The duration of the high population density was short and in July-August Leptodora density stayed below 200 ind. m(-3)., although the water temperature was still favourable. The collapse of the Leptodora population coincided with the change in the feeding habits of fish. In early summer, fish predation was targeted mainly on copepods and zoobenthos, while in high summer Leptodora was one of the main preys of perch, white bream and bleak. The biomass of herbivorous cladocerans was below 10 mug C 1(-1) in June, and climbed to a maximum in August in the two most shallow basins (34 and 76 mug C 1(-1)), in July in the deepest basin (27 mug C 1(-1)), and in September in the intermediate basin (55 mug C 1(-1)). In the two most shallow basins, the death rate of the dominating cladoceran, Daphnia cristata, closely followed the food consumption rate by the Leptodora population. In the deeper basins, the agreement was not so close, smelts (Osmerus eperlanus) and chaoborids being important predators of herbivores. The duration of the period of high Leptodora density thus depended on the predation pressure by fish, while the increased fish predation on Leptodora in July-August allowed the elevation of the biomass of herbivorous cladocerans.

Because of their remote location, they are often considered pristine, unpolluted ecosystems. Since the 1980s, however, they have been affected by global anthropogenic impacts. Macrobenthic invertebrates play a pivotal role in these ecosystems and can be used as bioindicators also for monitoring the accumulation of trace elements. We characterized the macrobenthic invertebrates community of Balma Lake (Cottian Alps, Northwest Italy) and Dimon Lake (Carnic Alps, Northeast Italy) in summer and autumn and measured the levels of nine trace elements (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, Se, Zn) in the most abundant taxa (Chironomidae and Oligochaeta in both lakes and Hirudinea in Dimon Lake) in both seasons. The highest levels of trace elements were recorded for Fe, Cu, and Zn according to their environmental availability and their function as essential elements. The total amount of trace elements was highest for the Chironomidae from both lakes compared to the other two taxa. As, Cd, Pb, and Zn were measured in sediment to calculate bioaccumulation factor (BAF) values. The amount of elements in sediment and macrobenthic invertebrates was higher for Dimon Lake, suggesting a greater flux via precipitation of contaminants from the lowland. The BAF values were decreased with increasing trace elements concentration in sediment, indicating mechanisms of elements excretion in biota where the environment is contaminated. This study is the first to report on the use of macrobenthic invertebrates to monitor trace elements in Alpine lakes.					cesarina, maria/AAY-7548-2020; squadrone, stefania/D-2024-2016; Esposito, Giuseppe/HKE-1040-2023; Prearo, Marino/AAF-3369-2021; Brizio, Paola/S-8275-2019; Pastorino, Paolo/T-5288-2019	Esposito, Giuseppe/0000-0001-6665-2712; Pastorino, Paolo/0000-0002-0585-1168; PIZZUL, ELISABETTA/0000-0001-9916-5005; Bertoli, Marco/0000-0001-8345-6107; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2020	27	6					5958	5970		10.1007/s11356-019-07325-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-07325-x		DEC 2019						31863368					WOS:000503669300017
J	Gan, FW; Gao, Y; Wei, Z				Gan, Fuwan; Gao, Yang; Wei, Zheng			Changes in the summer seasonal cycle of lakes in the Inner Tibetan Plateau since the 21st century	CLIMATIC CHANGE												In this study, 96 lakes on the Inner Tibetan Plateau (ITP) with an area larger than 40 km2 are selected and the time series of lake surface water temperature (LSWT) with a daily temporal resolution is decomposed using a seasonal-trend decomposition based on loess (STL). Annual changes in LSWT characterized by a trend component show that most of the lakes on the ITP are warming at a rate of 0.07 degrees C/10 yr, lower than the global average(0.34 degrees C/10 yr). The seasonal component is used to reclassify the lakes' summer season based on specific thresholds; indices characterizing summer include the summer onset (SO), summer end (SE), and summer duration (SD). On average, SO was essentially unchanged and SE has been delayed at a rate of 0.11 d/yr during 2000-2011. The situation changed considerably during 2012-2022, with SO and SE arriving earlier at a rapid rate of 0.34 d/yr and 0.18 d/yr, respectively. There is a strong link between these changes and climate factors in the period before the seasonal shift occurs, and the main climatic factors considered are air pressure, air temperature, downward surface solar radiation and wind speed. The asymmetric summer onset (SO)/ summer end (SE) variations (ASV) are quantified using a new index. The value of ASV characterizes both the variability of ITP lakes and the dominant factors that produce this variability. The classification of lakes in the ITP according to the value of ASV shows that most of the lakes in the ITP have prolonged summers and this prolongation was dominated by SO during 2012-2022, which is quite different from the situation in 2000-2011.																			0165-0009	1573-1480				APR	2025	178	4							70	10.1007/s10584-025-03911-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-025-03911-w													WOS:001451816000001

The Comparative Limnology of Lakes Nyos and Monoun, Cameroon	VOLCANIC LAKES	Advances in Volcanology											Lakes Nyos and Monoun are known for the dangerous accumulation of CO2 dissolved in stagnant bottom water, but the shallow waters that conceal this hazard are dilute and undergo seasonal changes similar to other deep crater lakes in the tropics. Here we discuss these changes with reference to climatic and water-column data collected at both lakes during the years following the gas release disasters in the mid-1980s. The small annual range in mean daily air temperatures leads to an equally small annual range of surface water temperatures (Delta T similar to 6-7 degrees C), reducing deep convective mixing of the water column. Weak mixing aids the establishment of meromixis, a requisite condition for the gradual buildup of CO2 in bottom waters and perhaps the unusual condition that most explains the rarity of such lakes. Within the mixolimnion, a seasonal thermocline forms each spring and shallow diel thermoclines may be sufficiently strong to isolate surface water and allow primary production to reduce P-CO2 below 300 mu atm, inducing a net influx of CO2 from the atmosphere. Surface water O-2 and pH typically reach maxima at this time, with occasional O-2 oversaturation. Mixing to the chemocline occurs in both lakes during the winter dry season, primarily due to low humidity and cool night time air temperature. An additional period of variable mixing, occasionally reaching the chemocline in Lake Monoun, occurs during the summer monsoon season in response to increased frequency of major storms. The mixolimnion encompassed the upper similar to 40-50 m of Lake Nyos and upper similar to 15-20 m of Lake Monoun prior to the installation of degassing pipes in 2001 and 2003, respectively. Degassing caused chemoclines to deepen rapidly. Piping of anoxic, high-TDS bottom water to the lake surface has had a complex effect on the mixolimnion. Algal growth stimulated by increased nutrients (N and P) initially stimulated photosynthesis and raised surface water O-2 in Lake Nyos, but O-2 removal through oxidation of iron was also enhanced and appeared to dominate at Lake Monoun. Depth-integrated O-2 contents decreased in both lakes as did water transparency. No dangerous instabilities in water-column structure were detected over the course of degassing. While Nyos-type lakes are extremely rare, other crater lakes can pose dangers from gas releases and monitoring is warranted.

Transitional circulation patterns from full ice cover to ice-off in a seasonally ice-covered lake	AQUATIC SCIENCES												There is consensus that under-ice circulation presents multiple phases through the winter, and that different mechanisms dominate each period. In this work, measurements of temperature, water velocity, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen from Lake Massawippi, Quebec, Canada, obtained during the ice-covered season in 2019, were used to characterize the time scales of different winter regimes and transitions among dominating circulation mechanisms. Lake circulation during this period began with a single-cell convection induced by sediment flux pulses in early winter. The single-cell convection decayed into a brief quiescent period. Radiatively driven convection then formed a convectively mixed layer in late winter. The defined mixed layer and temperature structure provided the necessary conditions for the formation of a potential rotational feature, which briefly formed immediately prior to ice break-up. Ice break-up led to complex hydrodynamics that persisted for nearly 28 days following full ice-off. Dissolved oxygen was directly correlated with the varying circulation features throughout the field campaign. This work provides a quantitative measure to delineate the transitions between under-ice regimes and provides novel insights into the subsequent circulation during and after ice break-up.

Uptake of inorganic carbon and ammonium in the light-bottle experiments in the 1 m layers, showed daily changes similar to chlorophyll .alpha. changes, though the uptake activities peaked before chlorophyll .alpha. peaks (phytoplankton blooms) appeared. Potential growth rates of phytoplankton and observed growth rates were calculated from the uptake rates and chlorophyll .alpha. changes. The potential growth rates did not always correspond to the observed growth rates. The potential growth rates did not correlate with the loss rates. The correlation between the observed growth rates and the loss rates was better. These results suggest that though the increase of uptake activities may be necessary for occurrence of phytoplankton blooms, loss processes may affect the occurrence of blooms.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV 29	1989	185	3					223	231		10.1007/BF00036610	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00036610													WOS:A1989CK35300006

Breeding Distribution and Ecology of Pacific Coast Surf Scoters	BOREAL BIRDS OF NORTH AMERICA: A HEMISPHERIC VIEW OF THEIR CONSERVATION LINKS AND SIGNIFICANCE	Studies in Avian Biology											Recent declines in sea duck populations have highlighted the need for additional basic research across the life cycle of these long-distance migratory birds. A lack of basic ecological information on Surf Scoters (Melanitta perspicillata), including the linkage between wintering and breeding areas and description of their nesting areas, is a major impediment to determining factors contributing to their decline. We marked 415 Surf Scoters with radio and satellite transmitters at four wintering areas along the Pacific coast to describe their breeding synchrony, sympatry, philopatry, and nesting areas selection in the northern boreal forest (NBF). Their primary breeding region was located in the western NBF centered on the Great Slave and Great Bear Lakes in the Northwest Territories, Canada, and their mean settling date (31 May) was remarkably synchronous (+/- 0.9 d). We developed a nearest-neighbor statistic C to examine nesting areas of individuals from different wintering areas and found that they were not clustered (C = 0.031, P = 0.15), but nests of eight individuals found in successive years were highly philopatric and within 1.2 +/- 0.2 km of their previous locations. Finally, we compared nesting areas and random locations with step-wise selection in a second-order Akaike Information Criterion (AIC(c)) analysis to identify the best models. Key landscape features included distance to snowline, elevation gradient, numbers of lakes, distance to treeline, and latitude. A nonparametric classification and regression tree (CART) showed that nesting areas were in an arc of habitat near snowline (<218 km), in lower elevation gradients (<14 m/km), and in areas with 3-6 lakes within 2 X 2 km. Climate change is predicted to have the greatest effects on more northern ecosystems, and NBF species like Surf Scoters with relatively inflexible breeding ecology may be adversely affected if they are unable to adapt quickly to rapidly changing conditions.					; Eadie, John/E-4820-2011	Eadie, John/0000-0001-9573-2703; 															978-0-520-95058-0				2011		41					41	63																WOS:000296090000005

Aquatic animals often overcome this condition with a combination of physiological, behavioural, biochemical and molecular responses. In the present study, we examined the effect of moderate hypoxia on superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and oxygen transport mechanism in Delminichthys ghetaldii erythrocytes. Popovo minnow ( Delminichthys ghetaldii ) is an endemic cyprinid fish which inhabits springs and streams in fields Ljubomir, Dabar and Fatnica in B&H, and Bacina lakes in Croatia. During autumn and spring floods, Popovo minnows emerge from the underground waters to surface estavelle. Withdrawal of the water to the underground basins brings them back to their underground habitat. Fishes were collected in the flood plain of Fatnica field (43 degrees 00 ' 53 '' N; 18 degrees 19 ' 24 '' E). Following erythrocyte lineage parameters were measured: number of red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin concentration, Packed cell volume (PCV), Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV), Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC) and MCH (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin). Also, the characterization of the SOD from RBC is presented for the first time. Native PAGE resolved the presence of three CuZn SOD isoforms, while isoelectrofocusing revealed the presence of two anionic SOD isoforms with pI 3.4 and 3.5. Exposure to conditions of mild hypoxia induced changes in fish SOD activity, hemoglobin concentration and MCH. Results indicate Delminichthys ghetaldii responds to hypoxia by enhancement of the oxygen carrying capacity and triggering SOD activity.

Even so, bacterioplankton diversity in large rivers influenced by cascade dams has been largely ignored. In this study, bacterial community diversity and profiles of seven cascade dams along the720 km of the Lancang River were studied using Illumina sequencing of the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene. Spatiotemporal variations of bacterial communities in sediment and water of the Gongguoqiao hydroelectric dam and factors affecting these variations were also examined. Microbial diversity and richness in surface water increased slightly from upstream toward downstream along the river. A significant positive correlation between spatial distance and dissimilarities in bacterial community structure was confirmed (Mantel test,r= 0.4826,p= 0.001). At the Gongguoqiao hydroelectric dam, temporal differences in water overwhelmed spatial variability in bacterial communities. Temperature, precipitation, and nutrient levels were major drivers of seasonal microbial changes. Most functional groups associated with carbon cycling in sediment samples decreased from winter to summer. Our findings improve our understanding of associations, compositions, and predicted functional profiles of microbial communities in a large riverine ecosystem influenced by multiple cascade dams.					; Che, Rongxiao/AAU-8452-2021	Che, Rongxiao/0000-0001-7907-478X; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				DEC	2020	27	34			SI		42933	42947		10.1007/s11356-020-10159-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-10159-7		JUL 2020						32725556					WOS:000553290900012

CO2 exchanges with the atmosphere reverse seasonally, with uptake by the lake in summer preceded and followed by larger losses to the atmosphere. Calcium bicarbonate-rich groundwaters seep steadily into the lake, augmented by remobilization of lacustrine marls. Most of the carbon used in summer photosynthesis nevertheless derives from depletion of lake carbon stores, facilitated significantly by plant calcification. Calcification in summer reduces alkalinity and calcium inventories by 15 and 25%, respectively, while generating equal molar quantities of CO2. Marl precipitates mainly on submersed macrophytes, several of which calcify in 1:1 ratio to photosynthesis when incubated in Ca-supplemented lake water. Despite calcite supersaturation within the epilimnion, there is little authigenic calcification.

LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The European winter of 2006-2007 was unusually mild, with record high mean winter air temperatures comparable with those predicted to become the norm by the end of the current century as a result of climate warming. In Lake Zurich and Greifensee, two neighboring Swiss perialpine lakes with several decades of data, mean lake temperatures for this winter were the highest ever recorded, as was thermal stability. Associated with the high thermal stability, mean winter oxygen concentrations in Lake Zurich were unusually high in the epilimnion and metalimnion, but normal in the hypolimnion. In Greifensee, however, which is much shallower, mean winter oxygen concentrations did not deviate substantially from the norm anywhere in the water column. From 17-19 January 2007, an unusually severe cyclonic storm, "Kyrill,'' traversed Europe. Monthly oxygen profiles suggest that the stabilizing effect of the mild winter on the two lakes was greatest before the occurrence of the storm, and that wind mixing resulted in a deepening of the mixed layer in both lakes. The mixing was able to encompass the entire water column of Greifensee, but not of Lake Zurich. These results, supported by more limited data from two other neighboring lakes, suggest that climate warming will likely inhibit complete mixing of some deep, temperate, normally monomictic lakes in winter even when extremely intense cyclonic storms occur. In shallower lakes, however, complete mixing is unlikely to be inhibited.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	2010	55	5					2170	2180		10.4319/lo.2010.55.5.2170	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2010.55.5.2170													WOS:000283667100033

PRODUCTIVITY AND RELATIONSHIPS	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												The collection of microphytobenthos for primary production studies in Lake Pavin was performed with a Jenkin sampler. This corer permits sampling at different levels below the surface of the lake. Five levels (10, 20, 30, 40 and 60 m below the surface) were regularly investigated for more than 1 yr. Each was inhabited by a characteristic population of dominant diatoms. The primary production, which was very large during the summer, decreases with depth. During the winter, the 14C assimilation occurs at a very low rate in clear incubators, but in dark incubators, the rate is high. The 14C fixation in darkness is greater than the photosynthetic assimilation. This phenomenon together with important data recorded for photosynthetic efficiency (especially at the lowest levels, 40 and 60 m deep) suggest that microphytes on the bottom of the lake assimilate organic compounds during much of the year.																			0020-9309						1980	65	6					849	869		10.1002/iroh.19800650608	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19800650608													WOS:A1980LD85900006

In addition, the monthly mean SST (sea surface temperature) data obtained by NOAA reconstruction, along with the calculations of NEC precipitation generated on the occurrence date of the annual early summer (June) northeast cold vortex (NECV) (hereinafter referred to as the cold vortex precipitation) were used to analyze the variation characteristics of cold vortex precipitation. The aim of this study was to explain the physical mechanism of the previous SST factors which had influenced the cold vortex precipitation through the force of atmospheric circulations, from the perspective of a statistical analysis. Finally, sensitivity tests of the AM2.1 atmospheric circulation model were conducted to verify the statistical analysis results. The results revealed that since 1961 there had been a significant increase trend in the early summer cold vortex precipitation. The relationships between the NEC early summer cold vortex precipitation and the previous SST were divided into three periods. During the period ranging from 1961 to 1979 (hereinafter referred to as Phase 1), a NAT anomaly positive phase during March to May resulted in the blocking highs of the Ural Mountains and the Sea of Okhotsk becoming strengthened ("dual blocking pattern") in the early summer, which in turn led to increased early summer cold vortex precipitation. During the period ranging from 1980 to 2000 (hereinafter referred to as Phase 2), a higher Kuroshio SST in April to May stimulated an EU-like teleconnection pattern in the early summer over Eastern Asia. As a result, the cold vortex precipitation in early summer was reduced. After 2001 (hereinafter referred to as Phase 3), the NAT anomaly negative phase during March to May induced strengthened blocking patterns on the northwestern side of Lake Baikal in the early summer, which was accompanied by a strengthened northeastern cold vortex (a pattern of "higher in the north, lower in the south"). Also, an upward vertical velocity anomaly appeared over the NEC, which resulted in increased early summer cold vortex precipitation. The sensitivity tests of this study's numerical model reproduced the force effects of the Kuroshio SST in Phase 2, and the NAT in Phase 3 on the EU-like teleconnection pattern, and the pattern of "higher in the north, lower in the south". These findings further corroborated the aforementioned results.					xu, shiqi/KEH-9943-2024; Chen, Haishan/W-3747-2018; Wang, Yongguang/G-9548-2013; Li, Tianyu/AAA-9301-2022	Chen, Haishan/0000-0002-2403-3187; 													0169-8095	1873-2895				DEC 1	2018	214						399	409		10.1016/j.atmosres.2018.08.007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2018.08.007													WOS:000445990400032

The core represents similar to 8 thousand years sedimentation of organic-diatomaceous lake mud. Constant inclusion of benthic diatom fossils as main components indicated that suspension and inflow of littoral materials were the main sedimentary process. The core contained laminated sediments in two distinct intervals at 6.5-5.0 and 3.6-3.1 cal ky BP, and multiproxy records showed generally drier climate in these sections especially at 3.6-3.1 cal ky BP. Lake bottom waters were more reducing condition in these laminated periods probably due to increased lake productivity by prolonged dry season and wind mixing. Laminae structures were made up of a layer composed of benthic diatoms and amorphous organic materials, and a layer made by only planktonic diatom fossils, each of which may represent rainy and dry period deposits. Although southern Indonesia shows clear Australian monsoon rainfall seasonality at present, counting of layer numbers showed interannual cycles of laminae formation. Prolonged dry seasons could obscured the rainfall seasonality in these periods, but precise depositional patterns were elusive. Unlaminated sections showed homogeneous sediment mixture of benthic, planktonic diatoms and more volume of terrigenous materials indicating wetter climate and seasonality similar to the present time. This was supported by the higher share of marsh environment pollens reflecting more stable lake level trends. The dry climate from 6.5 cal ky BP was in line with the general perception of stronger ENSO dynamics from the mid Holocene due to weaker than before boreal summer insolation, but the sporadic appearances of dry periods imply the influence of regional climate forcings such as temporal migrations of inter tropical convergence zone (ITCZ). It was, however, possible that temporal shifts of large climate mode occurred in equatorial Pacific and Indian Oceans. Wettest climate was inferred from 3.1 cal ky BP to the present and this might reflect increased importance of Austral hemisphere atmospheric convection and subsequent southerly position of ITCZ in Austral summer time.

Dan; Laudon, Hjalmar			Lake Outflow and Hillslope Lateral Inflows Dictate Thermal Regimes of Forested Streams Draining Small Lakes	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Empirical studies have highlighted the important influence of lakes on stream temperature at landscape scales, even when lakes comprise just a small fraction of the catchment area. However, only a few studies have focused on the hydrologic and thermal processes underpinning these landscape patterns. We collected detailed field measurements at a boreal stream that drains a headwater lake and used these data within a process-based stream temperature model to, (a) document the downstream extent of lake influences at both seasonal and event-based timescales, (b) assess the hydrologic and thermal processes that control the observed downstream variability, and (c) compare downstream temperature for streams with and without a headwater lake. Summer and autumn lake outlet temperatures were elevated compared to hillslope lateral inflow temperatures. During periods of low lake outflow, stream temperatures decreased rapidly downstream as local energy fluxes, primarily lateral inflows from the hillslopes and hyporheic exchange, overwhelmed the lake effects. The lake influence on downstream temperature was the greatest during periods of high lake outflow and persisted at least 1.4 km downstream. Since lakes can moderate and delay upstream rainfall runoff response, periods of high lake outflow and high hillslope inflow rates were generally out-of-phase. This difference in timing of warm lake outlet and cool hillslope water creates a dynamic thermal environment downstream of the small lake. Such lakes are ubiquitous in northern landscapes, and accounting for the competing influence of lake and hillslope contributions on downstream water temperature is critical for predicting how network-scale thermal regimes will respond to environmental change.

J	Martin, BA; Saiki, MK				Martin, BA; Saiki, MK			Effects of ambient water quality on the endangered Lost River sucker in Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Populations of the Lost River sucker Deltistes luxatus have declined so precipitously in the Upper Klamath Basin of Oregon and California that this fish was recently listed for federal protection as an endangered species. Although Upper Klamath Lake is a major refuge for this species, fish in the lake occasionally experience mass mortalities during summer and early fall. This field study was implemented to determine if fish mortalities resulted from degraded water quality conditions associated with seasonal blooms of phytoplankton, especially Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. Our results indicated that fish mortality did not always increase as water temperature, pH, and un-ionized ammonia concentration increased in Upper Klamath Lake. Little or no mortality occurred when these water quality variables attained their maximum values. On the other hand, an inverse relation existed between fish mortality and dissolved oxygen concentration. High mortality (>90%) occurred whenever dissolved oxygen concentrations decreased to 1.05 mg/L, whereas mortality was usually low (<10%) when dissolved oxygen concentrations equaled or exceeded 1.58 mg/L. Stepwise logistic regression also indicated that the minimum concentration of dissolved oxygen measured was the single most important determinant of fish mortality.																			0002-8487					SEP	1999	128	5					953	961		10.1577/1548-8659(1999)128<0953:EOAWQO>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1999)128<0953:EOAWQO>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000089183900017

Establishment and biological success of Diorhabda elongata elongata on invasive Tamarix in Texas	SOUTHWESTERN ENTOMOLOGIST												A leaf beetle, Diorhabda elongata elongata (Brulle), from Crete, Greece, was released unrestricted at two field locations (Lake Thomas and Beals Creek) within the upper Colorado River watershed of Texas between the summers of 2003 and 2004 as part of a Tamarix biological control program. D. elongeta elongata released at the Lake Thomas site in August 2003 successfully overwintered and was recovered in the spring 2004; however, beetles were not recovered at Lake Thomas past June 2004 despite additional releases in July 2004. Following releases in April and July 2004 at Beals Creek, D. elongata elongata did establish and was subsequently recovered during 2005 and 2006. In August 2006, the D. elongata elongata population was dispersed throughout an area of approximately 12 hectares, beetles or larvae were present on 100% of the 47 trees surveyed and 57% of which (27 trees) were at least 90% defoliated by D. elongata elongata.

Proposedly, Norwegian lemmings respond to the threat of critical resource depletion by conducting long-range migrations at their population peaks. A tacit premise of this conjecture is that predation pressure on the Fennoscandian tundra is too weak to prevent runaway increases of lemming populations, creating violent boom-crash dynamics. Our results on the dynamics of Norwegian lemmings on the Finnmarksvidda tundra during 1977-2017 are in line with the predictions of Kalela's hypothesis. In contrast to the Siberian and North American tundra, densities of avian predators in our study area have been low even during lemming years, and efficient ones have been lacking from lemming habitats. Lemmings have thus increased unhinged in peak summers and crashed to densities below the trappability threshold during post-peak winters. Each lemming crash has been accompanied by massive habitat destruction. Indications of predator activity have been concentrated to productive shrublands, where lemmings have never reached high densities. Young lemmings have responded to high densities by becoming extremely mobile: they have been trapped in large numbers on islands, including a small island in the middle of Ie & scaron;j & aacute;vri, a 10 x 8 km tundra lake. Many lemmings have been seen swimming across the lake, and many drowned lemmings have been observed. The dynamics and behavior of Norwegian lemmings recorded by us differ radically from those of other Lemmus spp., indicating that cycles generated by lemming-vegetation interactions have two alternative states - one with and the other without intense summer predation. We propose that the cycles of Norwegian lemmings shifted to the latter state during their unique evolutionary history, when they survived the Last Glacial Maximum in a tiny refugium archipelago.

Temporal and Spatial Study of Water Quality and Trophic Evaluation of a Large Tropical Reservoir	ENVIRONMENTS												A water quality study was carried out at the Adolfo Lopez Mateos (ALM) reservoir, one of the largest tropical reservoirs in Mexico, located within an intensive agricultural region. In this study, the seasonal and spatial variations of nine water quality parameters were evaluated at four different sites along the reservoir semiannually over a period of seven years (2012-2018), considering the spring (dry) and fall (rainy) seasons. An analysis of variance was performed to compare the mean values of the water quality parameters for the different sampling sites. Then, a multiparametric classification analysis was carried out to estimate the spatial density of the sampling points by using a probabilistic neural network (PNN) classifier. The observations (seasonal and spatial) of the water quality parameters at the ALM reservoir revealed no significant influence. The trophic status was evaluated using the Carlson Modified Trophic State Index, finding the trophic state of the reservoir at the mesotrophic level, with nitrogen being the limiting nutrient. The PNN revealed neural interactions between total suspended solids (TSS) and the other four parameters, indicating that the concentration ranges of five parameters are equally distributed and classified.

The chemocline is situated at a depth of 8.0-8.5 m and is approximately 1 m thick. This region has a strong specific conductance gradient with values increasing by a factor of 20 over a distance of 1 m. Tracing conductance isopleths over time suggests that the chemocline is being eroded at a rate of less than 1 cm/yr. Meromictic stabilities are low (.simeq. 100 g-cm/cm2); factors such as morphometric protection, summer thermal stratification and winter ice cover are probably important in maintaining meromixis. The monimolimnion has high specific conductance (26,000 .mu.mho/cm) and appears to be acting as a nutrient trap. Monimolimnetic P concentrations are as high as 26,000 mg P/m3 with more than 85% in the soluble reactive form.																			0270-5060	2156-6941					1982	1	5					483	493		10.1080/02705060.1982.9664067	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1982.9664067													WOS:A1982PB12900004

ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES ON WINTERING DUCK ABUNDANCE AT GREAT SALT LAKE, UTAH	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												North American waterfowl winter throughout a large geographic area, and the choice of wintering site has a direct impact on survival and fitness. Climatic and food variables are the most commonly cited factors influencing abundance and distribution of wintering migratory birds, including waterfowl. We conducted stratified aerial surveys at a northern latitude wintering site, Great Salt Lake (GSL), Utah, to describe the importance of this wintering area and to examine the influence of weather and food on the abundance of total ducks, Northern Shovelers (Anas clypeata), and goldeneye species (Bucephala spp.). Surveys indicated that up to 270,000 ducks use the GSL during winter, making it an important wintering area in the Pacific Flyway. Peak abundance of total ducks was positively correlated with overwinter temperatures. Northern Shoveler abundance was positively correlated with elevation of the GSL; higher lake elevation indicated more open water and hence more overwintering habitat. Goldeneye abundance was correlated with the continental population of the species and food abundance. All models had moderate fit (r(2) > 0.40). The GSL is unique in the United States as it is a large body of water where consistent ice cover does not occur and foraging habitat is available to ducks throughout winter. Our results suggest that ambient temperature and habitat availability are primary factors in the abundance of total wintering waterfowl, though food abundance seemed to influence wintering population size of individual duck species. We hypothesize that ducks endure the cold, hypersaline conditions on the GSL to exploit the abundant food supply and remain close to primary breeding regions.

The results show that the tail-water have some influences on the number and diversity of algae in summer when the lake water heat pump system works, and the total number of algae near the tail-water discharge point is lower than that in other regions, but the dominant algae in different sampling points are same at the same time. In winter, cold water discharge makes the total number of algae near the tail-water discharge point essentially higher than that in other regions. Moreover, cold discharge water can reduce the diversity index of the lake phytoplankton. In addition, tail-water has a seasonal influence on lake phytoplankton, and its cumulative environmental impact can be obtained through monitoring and comparative research by long-term.																			1022-6680		978-3-03785-742-7				2013	726-731						1301	+		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.726-731.1301	http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.726-731.1301													WOS:000333767500260

The species composition of phytoplankton in the River Emajogi resembles that of Lake Vortsjarv from which the river arises. The cyanobacteria Limnothrix planctonica (Woloszynska) Meffert, Limnothrix redekei (Van Goor) Meffert and Planktolyngbya limnetica (Lemmermann) Komarkova-Legnerova et Cronberg dominated the phytoplankton biomass. Phytoplankton abundance, biomass and chlorophyll a concentration showed an increasing trend from spring to late autumn. The results of principal component analysis revealed that the first and the second axes explained 43.6% and 14.5% of total variance, respectively. The first principal component was positively correlated with pH, O-2, BOD5 as well as with phytoplankton parameters, and negatively correlated with water level, transparency and concentrations of nitrite and carbonate. The second principal component was positively correlated with chemical oxygen demand and negatively correlated with the concentrations of ammonium and total phosphorus. Projection of the cases on the factor plane indicated that the water of the upper reach of the river and the water of the River Pedja differed significantly from each other as well as from the waters of a majority of other rivers																			0142-7873	1464-3774				NOV	2008	30	11					1285	1295		10.1093/plankt/fbn082	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbn082													WOS:000260558400008

Similar measurements, with the exception of the photosynthetic parameter, a had also been made in 1974/75 at eight sites on nine occasions. In inner Saginaw Bay where zebra mussels were primarily found, chlorophyll and kPAR values decreased, while the photosynthetic parameters, P-max and alpha, increased after zebra mussel colonization. At sites in the outer bay where no zebra mussels were found, chlorophyll and kPAR values did not change after zebra mussel colonization, whereas photosynthetic parameters increased. Decreases in chlorophyll and kPAR in the inner bay were related to the zebra mussel, but increases in photosynthetic parameters in both the inner and outer bay were not. Areal-integrated and volumetric phytoplankton productivity decreased by 38% and 37%, respectively, in inner Saginaw Bay after the establishment of zebra mussels; phytoplankton productivity at outer bay control sites was similar during the same period. Decreased phytoplankton productivity in the inner bay was attributable to the large decrease in chlorophyll as increases in underwater irradiance (increased kPAR) and photosynthetic parameters could not compensate for the chlorophyll effect. Increase in underwater irradiance produced a significant increase in light to the benthic region and contributed to increased benthic primary productivity; ratio of photic zone to station depth increased in inner Saginaw Bay, from 0.6-0.8 before the zebra mussel colonization (1974-1990) to 1.1-1.3 after colonization (1992-1993). Overall, primary productivity in the inner bay did not exhibit a notable change after zebra mussel colonization as decreases in phytoplankton productivity were accompanied by increases in benthic primary productivity. Thus, zebra mussels altered inner Saginaw Bay from a pelagic-dominated system to a benthic/pelagic system which will have long-term effects on food web structure and productivity at higher trophic levels.

General characteristics of the springs and their hydrofauna	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												The aquatic microecosystems and their environment have been studied in 12 mineral springs located in the Cis-Baikal Depression and in the basin of the upper reaches of the Lena River (Eastern Siberia). The hydrochemical characteristics of the springs, originating from the Cambrian salt deposits, are given. Their total mineralization varies from 1.1 to 123.0 g/L and the water is sodium chloride. The soils formed under the influence of the mineral waters ("para-soils") are described. The data on the composition and quantitative abundance of aquatic fauna are presented. Six types of macroinvertebrate communities are described. The communities where Turbellaria, Gastropoda, and Psychodidae dominate are recorded in weakly mineralized waters (< 3 g/L). The communities where Chironomidae dominate are found in waters characterized both by low and high (up to 28 g/L) salinity. In springs with a water salinity of 2.5-11 g/L, communities characterized by the dominance and high biomass of amphipods Gammarus lacustris Sars. are formed. A unique type of community where Ephydridae larvae dominate (> 97% of the biomass) is described for the concentrated brines in Ust'-Kutskii spring. Halophilic species of crustaceans are recorded in the meiofauna. The presence of Foraminifera (marine organisms) in the two studied springs attracts specific interest.

BREEDING ORIGINS OF NORTHERN SHOVELERS (ANAS CLYPEATA) WINTERING ON THE GREAT SALT LAKE, UTAH	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												The breeding origin and migratory connectivity of wintering birds are important to address how population changes on wintering areas are impacted by changes elsewhere in the birds' annual cycle. In addition, identifying important point sources of nutrients used throughout the annual cycle can assist managers in identifying sources of toxins or pathogens. We used stable hydrogen isotope ratios to identify breeding locations of Northern Shovelers (Anas clypeata; henceforth shoveler) wintering at the Great Salt Lake (GSL), Utah. Stable-isotope likelihood-based assignment placed the largest number of shovelers collected during winter on the GSL as breeding in the western US and southern Canada, similar to a small sample size of banding records. Shovelers wintering on the GSL generally did not breed locally or at the northern extent of their breeding range, rather wintering shovelers came from across their nesting range.																			1559-4491	1938-5447				JUN	2015	127	2					233	238		10.1676/wils-127-02-233-238.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1676/wils-127-02-233-238.1													WOS:000357726800006

Snowfall in some locations exceeded 140 cm, but the distribution within the event was highly variable. We examine the factors contributing to these variations using data from a Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) C-band surveillance radar, JMA soundings, surface precipitation observations, and a Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model simulation. There were three distinct periods during the event. Period 1 featured relatively weak flow with precipitation confined mainly to the coast and lowlands. Precipitation maxima were located where the flow ascended: 1) over terrain-blocked air, 2) at the foot of a high flow-normal barrier, or 3) relatively unimpeded over the lower mountain ranges. Flow strengthened during period 2, yielding stronger vertical velocities over the terrain with precipitation maxima shifting inland and to higher elevation. The flow strengthened further in period 3, with the precipitation maxima shifting higher in elevation and into the lee, with almost no precipitation falling in the lowlands. Thus, greater inland penetration and enhancement of precipitation occurred as the flow speed increased, but additional factors such as the subcloud sublimation of hydrometeors and the convective instability also contribute to differences between periods 2 and 3. These results illustrate the importance of incident flow strength in modulating the distribution and enhancement of snowfall in global lake- and sea-effect regions.

Water quality assessment and phosphorus budget of a lake (Mariut, Egypt) after diversion of wastewaters effluents	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The water quality of Lake Mariut has been deteriorated for about 5 decades due to continuous discharge of agricultural, municipal, and industrial wastes from Alexandria City and the adjacent land. During the past two decades, some steps were taken for rehabilitation of the lake through primary treatment of the discharged wastes and insulation of the polluted wastewater of QD from the water body in the main basin of the lake. Several parameters of water quality at the surface and near bottom were measured at twelve locations during winter (January) and summer (August) of 2013 and 2014. The present study revealed that the lake water appeared to be well aerated but still containing high concentrations of N and P and suffering hyper-eutrophic conditions. The water quality index (WQI) reflected medium condition in the lake and bad condition in the diverted drains.

Comparison of seasonal changes in fluorescent dissolved organic matter among aquatic lake and stream sites in the Green Lakes Valley	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The spectral characteristics of whole water dissolved organic matter (DOM) and fulvic acid were studied in samples collected from an alpine lake, a subalpine lake, and a subalpine stream during snowmelt and the summer growing season. Excitation-emission matrices of whole water DOM and fulvic acid were analyzed by parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Allochthonous inputs of terrestrially derived fulvic acid DOM were dominant during snowmelt at the alpine lake, and during both snowmelt and summer at the subalpine sites. At the alpine lake, autochthonous inputs of DOM dominated during the summer phytoplankton bloom, and the spectral characteristics of the whole water DOM diverged from those of the fulvic acid. For example, the quinone-like fluorophores in whole water DOM at the alpine lake were more oxidized and microbially derived than the fulvic acid fraction during the summer. At the subalpine sites, the seasonal changes in the source and redox state of the quinone-like fluorophores of the whole water DOM tracked those of the fulvic acid pool. However, at both lake sites there was a greater contribution of amino acid-like fluorophores in the whole water DOM than the fulvic acid fraction. This trend was not observed at the subalpine stream site. Principal components analysis (PCA) of the PARAFAC components suggests that during snowmelt, the chemical quality of the DOM at the alpine lake was similar to that of the subalpine stream; whereas the alpine site was more similar to the subalpine lake during the summer. Spectral characterization and PCA of the PARAFAC components suggest that nonhumic quinone-like and amino acid-like fluorophores were produced in the alpine lake during the summer phytoplankton bloom. Our results show that different types of water bodies produce different seasonal patterns in whole water DOM and fulvic acid quantity and quality.

Of China's major cities, Wuhan has the largest coverage of the lake area, while lake eutrophication is increasing. Thus, the objective of this study was to monitor and assess lake eutrophication in Wuhan. For this purpose, the lake eutrophication was quantified using the Trophic Level Index (TLI). The TLI was modeled by building a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) model with a set of indices derived from Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) imagery and a parameter of lake environmental characteristics. Applied MSI indices are the Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI) and the spectral band ratio of b5/b4 and b3/b4. In addition, the applied lake environmental parameter is the chlorophyll-a dependent month. Based on 54 MSI images from April 2018 to March 2020, the lake eutrophication was successfully determined. The main findings are as follows: 1) The higher percentage of eutrophic area was registered in the autumn (from September to November) and the highest was registered on September 12(th), 2019; 2) Compared to the same period in 2018, the eutrophic area in the autumn of 2019 was significantly higher. In the autumn of 2018, from 74.94% to 86.38% of the lakes were eutrophic, while from 83.54% to 93.24% of the lakes were eutrophic in the autumn of 2019; 3) The TLI values were between 30 and 70 for the majority of lakes in Wuhan, suggesting that most lakes were mesotrophic, light eutrophic, or medium eutrophic, with few oligotrophic and heavy eutrophic lakes. Most oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes were located in northern Wuhan, while eutrophic lakes were located in central and southern Wuhan. Our result indicates that the developed algorithm from this study could be applied for rapid and effective monitoring of eutrophication in lakes.

Population of Small Mammals in the Vicinity of the Torey Lakes (Southeast Transbaikalia) during the Dry Climatic Phase: Dynamics and Connection with Precipitation	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												The population and number dynamics of small mammals in the vicinity of the Torey lakes (Southeast Transbaikalia, Russia) were characterized between 2008 and 2017. The monitoring was carried out against the backdrop of the complete drying out of these largest lakes in the region. The stability of the fauna of small mammals was revealed over an 80-year period, although the structure of communities has changed significantly as a result of changes in moistening of the territory. Xerophilous species of mammals had an advantage in the period of studies in the dry climate phase. Correlation analysis showed a possible link between the population dynamics of some common species of small mammals with the precipitation amount of the current and previous years or with the precipitation amount of some spring (in one case, winter) months.

During 1982-1983, a long core was drilled to a bottom depth of 1422 m in order to investigate the palaeolimnological record, which contains 911 m of various sedimentary units overlying Palaeozoic-Mesozoic basements. A 249.5-m core of the uppermost bed (T Bed) was palynologically examined at intervals of ca. 2 m. The investigated part of the core covers approximately the last 430,000 years of the mid-Upper Pleistocene and Holocene, and five glacial-interglacial cycles can be recognized. Ten major vegetational zones could be recognized from the bottom to the surface. The zones bearing even numbers, BW-10, 8, 6, 4 and 2, matched glacial periods in which pollen of subarctic taxa (Pinaceae, Betula) and cool-temperate taxa (Fagus, Lepidobalanus) was dominant. In the glacial periods, high pollen values for temperate conifers such as Cryptomeria, Cupressaceae and Sciadopitys indicate interstadial periods. Zones bearing odd numbers, BW-9, 7, 5, 3 and 1, matched interglacial periods with high pollen values for the warm-temperate taxon Cyclobalanopsis, or showed the characteristic appearance of Lagerstroemia, and temperate coniferous taxa (Cryptomeria, Cupressaceae). There were two vegetational types in the interglacial periods. One was the type indicated by BW-9 and 1 zones, when warm-temperate evergreen broad-leaved trees such as Cyclobalanopsis and Castanopsis showed high pollen values, and the warm-temperate deciduous broad-leaved tree Lagerstroemia was lacking. The climate of these interglacial periods seems to have been cold and dry in winter, and warm and wet in summer. The other was the vegetational type recorded in BW-7, 5 and 3 zones, where Lagerstroemia showed low pollen values, and the warm-temperate evergreen broad-leaved trees mentioned above were poorly represented. The climate seems to have been mild and wet in winter, and cool and wet in summer. The dominant pollen values far cool-temperate deciduous broad-leaved taxa such as Fagus and Lepidobalanus are very important indicators of the initiation of both glacial and interglacial periods in western Japan.

The mixing regime of the reservoir is characterized as warm polymictic, and extended periods of comparably strong density stratification were observed during all seasons, interrupted by several mixing periods between autumn and winter. The stratification was affected by lateral, density-driven flows from the main river inflow. A forebay through which the river enters the reservoir influenced the density currents and reduced the occurrence of underflows. Flow velocities in the middle of the reservoir were generally small, and higher velocities (currents >3.5 cm s(-1)) were driven by wind. These currents were more frequent during stratified than during mixed periods. No basin-scale internal waves (seiches) were observed, but, high-frequency internal waves propagating, with periods between 2 and 17 min were present in all seasons. Dissipation rates of turbulent kinetic energy were generally small (10(-10)-10(-9) W kg(-1)). Wind-driven currents were associated with enhanced dissipation rates at the bottom-boundary layer but represented only 10% of the total monitored period. We identified several aspects in which the observed hydrodynamics of the reservoir differed from those of more commonly studied temperate aquatic systems. We expect that our findings are representative for a large number of small- to medium-sized lakes and for a growing number of reservoirs located in the tropical and subtropical zone.					; Bleninger, Tobias/H-3269-2012; Lorke, Andreas/B-9195-2008	Ishikawa, Mayra/0000-0001-6680-1570; Lorke, Andreas/0000-0001-5533-1817													2044-2041	2044-205X				JUL 3	2021	11	3					286	301		10.1080/20442041.2021.1932391	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2021.1932391		AUG 2021											WOS:000685331900001

The hydrological condition is commonly indicated with site-based hydrological data such as water level. Site-based data have high temporal resolution but are less effective to represent the spatial characteristics, a requirement for ecological/habitat models. In this study, we propose a method to identify suitable habitats for wintering geese based on the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) derived from Sentinel-2 satellite images. The relationships between NDWI, water level and geese occurrence were analyzed. The results showed that the NDWI of Poyang Lake can explain 75% of the changes in water level and at least 42% of the geese occurrence during wintering periods (with the exception of February 2019). The monthly NDWI optimal ranges suitable for wintering geese were identified to be from -0.12 to 0 and suitable NDWI threshold range is from -0.27 to 0.14. Based on this threshold range, we identified the suitable habitat for geese and found that the suitable habitat area first increased and later decreased during the whole wintering periods, following an inverted U-shaped dynamic. We concluded that NDWI can be used to improve distribution models of waterbird species to support their protection and wetland management.					; Yu, Xiubo/A-5875-2016; LIU, YU/F-8577-2017	Teng, Jiakun/0000-0001-9207-3765; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				MAR	2021	122								107260	10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.107260	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.107260													WOS:000613232500005

Patterns in Abundance, Cell Size and Pigment Content of Aerobic Anoxygenic Phototrophic Bacteria along Environmental Gradients in Northern Lakes	PLOS ONE												There is now evidence that aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic (AAP) bacteria are widespread across aquatic systems, yet the factors that determine their abundance and activity are still not well understood, particularly in freshwaters. Here we describe the patterns in AAP abundance, cell size and pigment content across wide environmental gradients in 43 temperate and boreal lakes of Quebec. AAP bacterial abundance varied from 1.51 to 5.49 x 10(5) cells mL(-1), representing <1 to 37% of total bacterial abundance. AAP bacteria were present year-round, including the ice-cover period, but their abundance relative to total bacterial abundance was significantly lower in winter than in summer (2.6% and 7.7%, respectively). AAP bacterial cells were on average two-fold larger than the average bacterial cell size, thus AAP cells made a greater relative contribution to biomass than to abundance. Bacteriochlorophyll a (BChla) concentration varied widely across lakes, and was not related to AAP bacterial abundance, suggesting a large intrinsic variability in the cellular pigment content. Absolute and relative AAP bacterial abundance increased with dissolved organic carbon (DOC), whereas cell-specific BChla content was negatively related to chlorophyll a (Chla). As a result, both the contribution of AAP bacteria to total prokaryotic abundance, and the cell-specific BChla pigment content were positively correlated with the DOC: Chla ratio, both peaking in highly colored, low-chlorophyll lakes. Our results suggest that photoheterotrophy might represent a significant ecological advantage in highly colored, low-chlorophyll lakes, where DOC pool is chemically and structurally more complex.					; Cottrell, Matthew/C-3266-2009; del Giorgio, Paul/AAD-1315-2019; Borrego, Carles/M-8094-2014	Cottrell, Matthew/0000-0003-0449-9999; GARCIA CHAVES, MARIA CAROLINA/0000-0002-7600-533X; del Giorgio, Paul/0000-0003-1866-8159; Borrego, Carles/0000-0002-2708-3753													1932-6203					APR 30	2015	10	4							e0124035	10.1371/journal.pone.0124035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0124035								25927833					WOS:000353713100027

Using radiocarbon to constrain black and organic carbon aerosol sources in Salt Lake City	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC) aerosols are important components of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in polluted urban environments. Quantifying the contribution of fossil fuel and biomass combustion to BC and OC concentrations is critical for developing and validating effective air quality control measures and climate change mitigation policy. We used radiocarbon (C-14) to measure fossil and contemporary biomass contributions to BC and OC at three locations in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA, during 2012-2014, including during winter inversion events. Aerosol filters were analyzed with the Swiss_4S thermal-optical protocol to isolate BC. We measured fraction modern (f(M)) of BC and total carbon in PM2.5 with accelerator mass spectrometry and derived the f(M) of OC using isotope mass balance. Combined with C-14 information of end-member composition, our data set of 31 C-14 aerosol measurements provided a baseline of the fossil and contemporary biomass components of carbonaceous aerosol. We show that fossil fuels were the dominant source of carbonaceous aerosol during winter, contributing 88% (80-98%) of BC and 58% (48-69%) of OC. While the concentration of both BC and OC increased during inversion events, the relative source contributions did not change. The sources of BC also did not vary throughout the year, while OC had a considerably higher contemporary biomass component in summer at 62% (49-76%) and was more variable. Our results suggest that in order to reduce PM2.5 levels in Salt Lake City to meet national standards, a more stringent policy targeting mobile fossil fuel sources may be necessary.

J	Huang, CJ; Hinnov, L				Huang, Chunju; Hinnov, Linda			Astronomically forced climate evolution in a saline lake record of the middle Eocene to Oligocene, Jianghan Basin, China	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Following the early Eocene climatic optimum some 50 million years ago, the marine paleoclimate record indicates that a long interval of global cooling took place, punctuated by a series of short-term warming reversals and culminating with the glaciation of Antarctica at the Eocene-Oligocene transition. We investigate a saline lake record from the Qianjiang and Jinghezhen formations, Jianghan Basin, China for the corresponding continental climate response. A 20.25 Myr long astronomical time scale is constructed based on 405-kyr orbital eccentricity cycle tuning of gamma ray (GR) series measured from the Qianjiang and Jinghezhen formations. The halite-rich interval between 41-40.4 Ma correlates well with the Middle Eocene Climate Optimum recorded in the deep-sea delta O-18 record, confirming predominantly halite deposition during the warming. Silt-mudstone-rich intervals were deposited during similar to 2.4 Myr orbital eccentricity minima. The evidence indicates a history of alternating fresh water (humid/cool) and saline water (dry/hot) lake cycles paced by similar to 100 kyr orbital eccentricity cycles. Analysis of GR series from the deepest part of the lake indicates strong astronomical forcing of halite deposition throughout the Middle-Late Eocene, and a shift to siliciclastic deposition and cooler climates at similar to 33.9 Ma. Early Oligocene wet/cool climate in the Jianghan Basin signals East Asian summer monsoon intensification, and a reduction from northwest winter monsoon in response to Tibetan Plateau uplift. Northern Hemisphere summer insolation minima in the Middle-Late Eocene with temperatures that are 4.6 degrees C higher than present may provide an analogy for near-future climate change in Jianghan Basin.

This study employs Sentinel-1 data to monitor soil erosion in the Dongting Lake-Hong Lake Basin (DHB) from 2015 to 2022, as well as its impact on nearby urban infrastructure. To address surface coverage complexities, Small Baseline Subset and Persistent Scatterers techniques are combined to generate and analyse the spatiotemporal deformation time series in the DHB. The study identifies significant subsidence in seasonal lake areas, riverbanks and agricultural zones within Dongting Lake, alongside five smaller regions with decelerating subsidence. In contrast, the Yueyang Tower, located in a tectonic uplift zone, exhibits slow uplift consistent with geological estimates. Seasonal summer uplift and winter subsidence, caused by thermal expansion and contraction, were detected in key linear infrastructure. By integrating geological context with time-series deformation, the research reveals spatiotemporal deformation patterns in the DHB (2015-2022), offering insights into deformation mechanisms and supporting regional hydrological management.																			2150-704X	2150-7058				APR 3	2025	16	4					412	421		10.1080/2150704X.2025.2468352	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2025.2468352													WOS:001432099600001

Information from the sedimentation traps was used to determine the sinking loss rates of diatoms and to estimate the relative contribution of sedimentation to the loss of these species. Sinking loss rates varied with time and with depth. Sinking loss rates for Stephanodiscus astrea, Melosira granulata and Asterionella formosa increased with the onset of thermal stratification. The abundance of Cyclotella meneghiniana declined as the surface pH increased. The results showed good agreement between the proposed sedimentary fluxes of diatoms and the corresponding maximum standing crop. Information from the trap catches was also used to examine the possibility of recruitment of summer blue-green species from the sediments. Specific migration rates of floating colonies of Microcystis aeruginosa, Gomphosphaeria lacustris and of Lyngbya Birgei filaments at 10 m were high (> 1) for periods of time in Aug. For these blue-green algae, estimates of the population gain due to recruitment from the sediments ranged from 2-4% of the maximum standing crop. The high rates of accumulation of total P (TP) in the downward facing trap at 10 m provided further evidence that resuspension of material from the sediments occurred at this time. The appearance of these blue-green algae coincided with high surface temperatures and the development of anoxic conditions at 10 m. The growth or recruitment of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae was initiated under different environmental conditions than those for Microcystis, Gomphosphaeria and Lyngbya. The Aphanizomenon filaments present at Station 1 apparently originated from the Station 3 end of the lake and were advected towards Station 1.																			0142-7873	1464-3774					1984	6	5					897	918		10.1093/plankt/6.5.897	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/6.5.897													WOS:A1984TH56400013

The annual total fluvial input of arsenic (As) to the lake is approximately 3.5 tonnes. The dissolved As concentrations in the water show seasonal differences, with an average concentration of 62 mug/L during the summer, and 22 mug/L in winter. The As bound to particles represent approximately 8% of the total As burden in the water column. Arsenic bound to the organic humic, fulvic and lipid fractions represents approximately 1% of the total As in Moira Lake waters. The dissolved As profile of interstitial waters are characterized by subsurface maxima with concentrations four to six times greater than the lake waters. Inorganic As makes up the majority of the As in all the porewater profiles examined. The upward diffusion of As-enriched interstitial waters can explain the distribution of As(III) and As(V) in the overlying lake water.

Short transmission opportunities of cercariae are often compensated by periodic daily rhythms in the cercarial release. However, there are virtually no data on the cercarial emergence of bird schistosomes from freshwater ecosystems in northern latitudes. We investigated the daily cercarial emergence rhythms of the bird schistosome Trichobilharzia sp. "peregra" from the snail host Radix balthica in a subarctic lake under both natural and laboratory seasonal conditions. We demonstrated a circadian rhythm with the highest emergence during the morning hours, being seasonally independent of the photo- and thermo-period regimes of subarctic summer and autumn, as well as relatively high production of cercariae at low temperatures typical of northern environments. These patterns were consistent under both field and laboratory conditions. While light intensity triggered and prolonged cercarial emergence, the temperature had little effect on cercarial rhythms but regulated seasonal output rates. This suggests an adaptive strategy of bird schistosomes to compensate for the narrow transmission window. Our results fill a gap in our knowledge of the transmission dynamics and success of bird schistosomes under high latitude conditions that may serve as a basis for elucidating future potential risks and implementing control measures related to the spread of cercarial dermatitis due to global warming.					; Scholz, Tomas/G-8360-2014; Soldanova, Miroslava/G-7215-2014; Born-Torrijos, Ana/N-9126-2017	Amundsen, Per-Arne/0000-0002-2203-8216; Scholz, Tomas/0000-0002-6340-3750; Soldanova, Miroslava/0000-0002-5277-3799; Born-Torrijos, Ana/0000-0002-1258-3616														2076-0817				JUN	2022	11	6							647	10.3390/pathogens11060647	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens11060647								35745501					WOS:000817420700001
J	Molnár, K				Molnár, K			Taxonomic problems, seasonality and histopathology of Henneguya creplini (Myxosporea) infection of the pikeperch Stizostedion lucioperca in Lake Balaton	FOLIA PARASITOLOGICA												Plasmodia of a Henneguya species measuring 70-900 mu m and exhibiting season-dependent stages of development were detected throughout a three-year study on gill myxosporosis of Lake Balaton pikeperch (Stizostedion lucioperca (L.)). Sixty-five out of 160 fish (41%) examined in the period of study were infected by the parasite. Infection was the most prevalent (48%) among pikeperch specimens exceeding 40 cm in length. The highest prevalence of infection (58%) was recorded in 1995-1996 while the lowest (30%) in 1996-1997. The youngest plasmodia appeared in April, and started to develop within the capillaries of the secondary lamellae of the gill filaments. The round or ellipsoidal plasmodia which continued their gradual growth in the subsequent months of the year achieved a size of 800-900 mu m by the late autumn months, but remained in intralamellar location throughout the developmental cycle. Mature spores developed in the plasmodia by the end of winter. On the basis of their shape and size, the spores were identified as Henneguya creplini (Gurley, 1894). However, because of the uncertain taxonomy of species assigned to the genus Henneguya the taxonomic position of the parasite requires further study. The host reaction consisting of epithelial proliferation and granulation tissue formation starts around the infected secondary lamella only after the maturation of spores and the disruption of plasmodia.

The limited water depths (about 1 m) and the depletion of oxygen occurring in the summer suggest that there may be a nutrient release from the bottom sediments to the water column. Temperature, salinity, pH and dissolved oxygen concentration in the water column were measured onsite using suitable portable equipment. Nitrites, nitrates, total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a were determined in water samples, whereas total Kjeldahl nitrogen and total phosphorus in sediment samples. Nutrient concentrations in the water column of Eratino Lagoon increased during the winter (nitrate: from 69 to 76 mu g l(-1); total phosphorus: from 93 to 116 mu g l(-1)). Nutrient concentrations also increased in Vassova Lagoon. Chlorophyll-a concentration appeared to be nearly stable in both lagoons. Total Kjeldahl nitrogen in the sediment showed increased winter values, especially near the agricultural drainage canal of Eratino Lagoon (10.7 mg l(-1)). On the contrary, total phosphorus in the bottom sediments decreased by almost one order of magnitude in Eratino Lagoon (from 468 to 26 mu g g(-1) d.w.), and less in Vassova Lagoon, revealing a phosphorus release from bottom sediments into the water column. Both lagoons were characterized as mesotrophic to hypertrophic. Best management practices have to be implemented in order to improve the water and sediment quality of these two lagoons.					; Sylaios, Georgios/AAM-6994-2020; Gikas, Georgios/AAE-3347-2019; Tsihrintzis, Vassilios/AAL-5125-2021	SYLAIOS, GEORGIOS/0000-0003-2327-4015; Gikas, Georgios/0000-0002-1685-6394; 													1018-4619						2006	15	9B			SI		1168	1173																WOS:000241755100013
J	Müller, U				Müller, U			The vertical zonation of adpressed diatoms and other epiphytic algae on Phragmites australis	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												The seasonal colonization and vertical zonation of adpressed and upright algae on Phragmites stems in Lake Belau, Germany, was investigated from November 1988 to October 1991. During the autumns and winters from 1988 to 1990 the dominant adpressed species included the diatoms Epithemia ndnata, E. sorex, E. turgida and Rhopalodia gibba, while during the same seasons in 1990 and 1991, Cocconeis placentula var. euglypta was abundant. The upright diatoms were most abundant on the middle sections of the stems, whereas those epiphytes with most of their cell surfaces directly in contact with the substratum constituted the greatest part of the biomass on the lowest sections of the stems. Epthemia spp. and R. gibba attained their highest abundances near the sediment as well as buried beneath the most dense periphyton aggregations, while there were dense populations of C. placentula var, euglypta on the entire surface of the stems. Cocconeis is able to tolerate higher light intensities, with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) values averaging 38 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), than Epithemia and Rhopalodia, which settle at a significantly lower PAR (26 and 20 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively). The change in dominance among the adpressed species from Epithemia and Rhopalodia to Cocconeis can be explained by changes in the grazing habits of the snail Acroloxus lacustris.																			0967-0262					NOV	1999	34	5					487	496		10.1080/09541449910001718841	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09541449910001718841													WOS:000085341700006

Seismic evidence for complex sedimentary control of Greenland Ice Sheet flow	SCIENCE ADVANCES												The land-terminating margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet has slowed down in recent decades, although the causes and implications for future ice flow are unclear. Explained originally by a self-regulating mechanism where basal slip reduces as drainage evolves from low to high efficiency, recent numerical modeling invokes a sedimentary control of ice sheet flow as an alternative hypothesis. Although both hypotheses can explain the recent slowdown, their respective forecasts of a long-term deceleration versus an acceleration of ice flow are contradictory. We present amplitude-versus-angle seismic data as the first observational test of the alternative hypothesis. We document transient modifications of basal sediment strengths by rapid subglacial drainages of supraglacial lakes, the primary current control on summer ice sheet flow according to our numerical model. Our observations agree with simulations of initial postdrainage sediment weakening and ice flow accelerations, and subsequent sediment restrengthening and ice flow decelerations, and thus confirm the alternative hypothesis. Although simulated melt season acceleration of ice flow due to weakening of subglacial sediments does not currently outweigh winter slowdown forced by self regulation, they could dominate over the longer term. Subglacial sediments beneath the Greenland Ice Sheet must therefore be mapped and characterized, and a sedimentary control of ice flow must be evaluated against competing self-regulation mechanisms.					; Christoffersen, Poul/C-7328-2013; Hubbard, Alun/R-5085-2017	Doyle, Samuel/0000-0002-0853-431X; Bougamont, Marion Heidi/0000-0001-7196-4171; Christoffersen, Poul/0000-0003-2643-8724; Booth, Adam/0000-0002-8166-9608; Lindback, Katrin/0000-0002-5941-6743; Kulessa, Bernd/0000-0002-4830-4949; Hubbard, Alun/0000-0002-0503-3915; Dow, Christine/0000-0003-1346-2258; Jones, Glenn/0000-0002-7691-332X													2375-2548					AUG	2017	3	8							e1603071	10.1126/sciadv.1603071	http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1603071								28835915					WOS:000411589900043

Quantifying emissions of methane derived from anaerobic organic matter respiration and natural gas extraction in Lake Erie	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Despite a growing awareness of the importance of inland waters in regional and global carbon (C) cycles, particularly as sources of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), very little is known about C sources and fluxes in the Laurentian Great Lakes, Earth's largest surface freshwater system. Here, we present a study of CH4 dynamics in Lake Erie, which has large spring algae blooms linked to fertilizer runoff and followed by hypoxia, as well as an extensive network of natural gas wells and pipelines in Canadian waters. Lake Erie is a positive source of CH4 to the atmosphere in late summer, even in shallow regions without water column hypoxia. Stable isotopic measurements indicate that both biogenic and thermogenic CH4 contribute to emissions from Lake Erie. We estimate that Lake Erie emits 1.3 +/- 0.6 x 10(5) kg CH4-C d(-1) in late summer, with approximately 30% of CH4 derived from natural gas infrastructure. Additional work is needed to determine the spatial and temporal dynamics of CH4 emissions from Lake Erie and to confirm estimates of source contribution. Studies of the C cycle in large lakes are not as straightforward as those in smaller lakes, as, in addition to O-2 availability, subsurface currents and high winds may exert significant control over dissolved CH4 patterns. If climate warming and increasing precipitation intensity lead to increased algal biomass and/or greater extent and duration of hypoxia, this may increase emissions of CH4 from Lake Erie in a positive feedback to climate change.

Common Loons (Gavia immer) Wintering off the Louisiana Coast Tracked to Saskatchewan during the Breeding Season	WATERBIRDS												Common Loon (Gavia burner) migration pathways have been previously identified using resightings, band recoveries, and satellite tracking with platform terminal transmitters, but there remains much to be learned. No band recoveries or resightings of Common Loons from Louisiana have been documented to date, and it is unclear where Common Loons from this region migrate and breed. On 29 March 2011, as part of a pilot study, we implanted two platform terminal transmitters in Common Loons wintering off the Louisiana coast. Both individuals migrated to Saskatchewan, Canada. Previous research using satellite telemetry on migrating Common Loons in the western USA states (Nevada and Montana) showed they migrated to Saskatchewan, but wintered at Lake Mead, Nevada, the Gulf of California and the Pacific Ocean. Our findings are of interest as Common Loons from the same breeding area in Saskatchewan overwinter in different regions of North America.																			1524-4695	1938-5390				APR	2014	37				1		47	52		10.1675/063.037.sp107	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/063.037.sp107													WOS:000335613500007

We examined seston dynamics and filter-feeding macro invertebrate communities in sites representing headwaters to large rivers in the Kansas River drainage, northeastern KS. Seston samples were collected at least seasonally during low to moderate flows for one year beginning in the summer of 1999, and quality was assessed by determining organic content and C to N ratio. A rapid hioassessment approach was used to examine filter-feeders. Relationships between stream size and seston concentrations were markedly influenced by anthropogenic activities. There was no relationship between total seston concentration and stream size across all sites (r = 0.14, p > 0.05), but a significant, positive relationship was evident when impounded and suburban sites were excluded (r = 0.73, p < 0.01); this same trend was evident for organic and inorganic components. Seasonal patterns of C to N ratio were evident, with generally lower values during winter and highest values in summer. However, seasonal patterns were dampened in suburban sites and virtually absent below impoundments. Filter-feeder richness was correlated with average organic seston concentrations (r = 0.8,p < 0.01), but this relationship was also obscured by impoundments and suburban development. In particular, impoundments had a dramatic, negative effect on richness. Abundance of most hydropsychid caddisfly taxa was positively correlated with organic seston concentration. Results indicate there are significant patterns regarding seston, filter-feeders, and stream size in this Great Plains river system, but patterns are strongly influenced by human activities. These relationships are relevant to management issues regarding suspended particles and the potential development of bioassessment techniques.

Peripheral blood consisted of erythrocytes (up to 90%) and their immature forms, leukocytes and thrombocytes. Leukocytes were represented by agranulocytes (lymphocytes from 40 to 90%, monocytes, pseudogranulocytes or polymorphonuclear leucocytes) and granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils). Basophil granulocytes were not found in these coregonids. Baikal whitefishes and omul had few granulocytes in their peripheral blood, whereas the predecessors of these cells were present in blood-forming organs. We suggest that the mechanisms of immune protection defined by granular leukocytes were not activated in endemic coregonids from Lake Baikal. The cytometric, red and white blood parameters within ecological and morphological types of coregonid fishes from Lake Baikal differed mainly in the size of the cells and nuclei of mature erythrocytes.

Relationship between hydrological characteristics and dissolved organic carbon concentration and mass in northern prairie wetlands using a conservative tracer approach	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The semiarid prairie pothole region of the North American Great Plains is characterized by millions of small, shallow, closed basin wetlands. These wetlands are hydrologically dynamic, often losing considerable water volume and depth seasonally in response to high evaporative stress and/or infiltration rates. However, the consequences of such water loss on wetland water chemistry parameters, in particular dissolved organic carbon ( DOC), remain relatively unstudied. Seasonal changes in DOC concentrations in 12 freshwater and saline wetlands at the St. Denis National Wildlife Refuge near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, were examined over an 8-year period ( 1993 - 2000). Specific conductivity in the study ponds ranged from 312 mu S cm(-1) to 33,493 mu S cm(-1) ( seasonal means). DOC concentrations in all study ponds were high (> 10 mg L-1) and increased across a gradient of increasing salinity ( mean DOC values from fresh water to saline ranged from 19.7 mg L-1 to 102.7 mg L-1). In the majority of ponds, DOC concentrations increased seasonally from spring through fall. On average this increase was 21 mg L-1, with fall values averaging 60% greater than spring. The greatest DOC increases were observed in saline ponds which lost most of their water by evaporation. Although DOC in these ponds was highly correlated with the conservative tracer, chloride, the slopes of these regression lines were always less than 1 as were the DOC: chloride ratios, indicating nonconservative DOC behavior. Additionally, chloride concentrations increased much faster seasonally than did DOC. Taken together, these data indicated that although DOC was not behaving conservatively, at least some of the observed DOC increases could be explained by simple evapoconcentration. These data also suggested that saline ponds appeared to experience net seasonal removal of DOC. Possible removal mechanisms for DOC include infiltration to the pond margin, bacterial utilization, and photolysis. Freshwater ponds, which lost most of their water by infiltration to the pond margin, on the other hand, displayed less seasonal variation in DOC concentrations. In these ponds, the relationship between DOC and chloride ion was not as strong as in the saline ponds; the slope of this relationship was always > 1, as were DOC: chloride ratios. These data indicated that although DOC was being lost to the pond margin as water infiltrated, freshwater ponds accumulated DOC seasonally. Decomposition and excretion of DOC by macrophytes, as well as by pelagic and attached phytoplankton, are the likely within pond sources of DOC here. The rapid response of these small, shallow aquatic systems to water loss make them ideal microcosms in which to study effects of climate on DOC concentrations and other water chemistry parameters.																			2169-8953	2169-8961				JUN 24	2006	111	G2							G02024	10.1029/2005JG000088	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2005JG000088													WOS:000240992100001

Of recent importance is the management of these freshwater ecosystems because lakes deeper than maximum ice thickness provide an important and often sole source of liquid water for aquatic biota, villages, and industry during winter. To better understand seasonal and annual hydrodynamics in the context of lake morphometry, we analyzed lakes in two adjacent areas where winter water use is expected to increase in the near future because of industrial expansion. Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus imagery acquired between 1985 and 2007 were analyzed and compared with climate data to understand interannual variability. Measured changes in lake area extent varied by 0.6% and were significantly correlated to total precipitation in the preceding 12 months (p < 0.05). Using this relation, the modeled lake area extent from 1985 to 2007 showed no long-term trends. In addition, high-resolution aerial photography, bathymetric surveys, water-level monitoring, and lake-ice thickness measurements and growth models were used to better understand seasonal hydrodynamics, surface area-to-volume relations, winter water availability, and more permanent changes related to geomorphic change. Together, these results describe how lakes vary seasonally and annually in two critical areas of the NPRA and provide simple models to help better predict variation in lake-water supply. Our findings suggest that both overestimation and underestimation of actual available winter water volume may occur regularly, and this understanding may help better inform management strategies as future resource use expands in the NPRA.					; Beck, Richard/JIS-6286-2023	Jones, Benjamin/0000-0002-1517-4711; Arp, Christopher/0000-0002-6485-6225; 													0364-152X	1432-1009				JUN	2009	43	6					1071	1084		10.1007/s00267-008-9241-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-008-9241-0								19101761					WOS:000267030200011

In lakes, IOP measurements have not been traditionally collected. This study describes how high-frequency IOP profiles can be used to document short-term physical and biogeochemical processes that ultimately influence the long-term trajectory of lake ecosystems. Between October 2018 and May 2020, we collected 1373 high-resolution hyperspectral IOP profiles in the uppermost 50 m of the large mesotrophic Lake Geneva (Switzerland-France), using an autonomous profiler. A data set of this size and content does not exist for any other lake. Results showed seasonal variations in the IOPs, following the expected dynamic of phytoplankton. We found systematic diel patterns in the IOPs. Phases of these diel cycles were consistent year-round, and amplitudes correlated to the diurnal variations of dissolved oxygen, clarifying the link between IOPs and phytoplankton metabolism. Diel amplitudes were largest in spring and summer under low wind condition. Wind-driven changes in thermal stratification impacted the dynamic of the IOPs, illustrating the potential of high-frequency profiles of water optical properties to increase our understanding of carbon cycling in lake ecosystems.					; Rahaghi, Abolfazl/AAR-3462-2020; Minaudo, Camille/AAG-9707-2019; Odermatt, Daniel/A-9379-2011	Lavanchy, Sebastien/0000-0002-7417-8587; Irani Rahaghi, Abolfazl/0000-0003-2703-8319; Odermatt, Daniel/0000-0001-8449-0593; Minaudo, Camille/0000-0003-0979-9595													0013-936X	1520-5851				OCT 19	2021	55	20					14234	14244		10.1021/acs.est.1c02585	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c02585		SEP 2021						34591466					WOS:000710453500082

Implications of space use for recovery of white sturgeon Acipenser transmontanus in a transboundary reach of the Upper Columbia River	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Conservation aquaculture has prevented extirpation of Upper Columbia River white sturgeon Acipenser transmontanus, but uncertainty remains on how hatchery-origin fish move between habitats located within Canada and the United States. We describe how core and home ranges of sturgeon varied by environmental (country, season) and biological (age, sex, size) factors and determined residence at important habitats. Core range represented areas where individuals spent the majority of their time, while home range represented most areas occupied. Fidelity to specific habitats was high, with home ranges averaging 10 km2 and 50% of individuals occupied the same core range across their entire detection period. Only 12% of individuals had home ranges encompassing both countries. Core and home ranges were larger during the summer compared to winter and larger within the United States compared to Canada. Larger (>120 cm) sturgeon had increased core and home ranges. We documented spawning capable hatchery-origin males and confirmed their residence at spawning sites when spawning was detected.

However, regional and global estimates suffer from methodologically inconsistent data sets and from the situation that systematic flux measurements are presently available only for some regions in the world. In particular, many temperate regions dominated by agricultural land use, like central Europe, lack regional multi-lake studies of lacustrine CH4 emissions. We compare estimates of diffusive and ebullitive flux from 30 small central European and 17 small boreal lakes based on standardized measurements during a single visit per lake in late summer. Furthermore, we assess the amount of CH4 accumulated in the hypoxic deep-water layers in late summer. This provides an estimate of the potential release of CH4 from these lakes during autumn mixing (storage flux). The results show that emissions per unit area of lake surface from central European lakes are significantly higher than those from boreal lakes, with average estimates of diffusive and ebullitive flux being as much as six and 27 times higher, respectively. CH4 concentration in the surface water was significantly related with lake area and maximum depth in the boreal lakes. However, no significant relationships between diffusive and ebullitive fluxes and lake basin morphometry were found in central European or boreal lakes, as proposed in earlier studies, although the short measurement period (6h) may not have been adequate for reliably quantifying ebullition in our study. As expected, storage flux was related to relative depth and relative volume of the hypoxic water layer in both regions. We discuss the relevance of the higher observed diffusive and ebullitive fluxes for regional estimates in central Europe based on an example of previous emission estimates from small lakes in Switzerland. Our results suggest that diffusive and ebullitive CH4 emissions from these lakes may be considerably higher than estimated based on widely applied relationships for predicting lacustrine CH4 emissions developed in northern European and North American regions. The results also confirm that modifications are necessary when applying these relationships to central European lakes. Our study highlights the inter-regional variability in lacustrine CH4 emissions and the need for regionally developed calibration data for validating and developing predictive models for estimating CH4 emissions from lakes at the landscape scale.

Measurements of heterotrophic bacteria, autotrophic picoplankton (APP) and heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) in 2006 and 2007 were compared to values from 1987 to 1997. We hypothesized that the biomass and seasonal variability of all groups will decrease under more oligotrophic conditions due to reduced resource availability, particularly for APP and HNF but less for the competitively stronger bacteria. Average bacterial biomass between spring and autumn was unrelated to phosphorus, whereas the ratio of bacterial biomass to chlorophyll a concentration increased with decreasing trophy due to declining chlorophyll concentrations. In contrast, a unimodal relationship was found between APP and phosphorus with low biomass at low and high phosphorus concentrations and maximum biomass in between. Average HNF biomass decreased strongly by a factor of 10-30 with decreasing trophy, and chlorophyll-specific HNF biomass was unimodally related to phosphorus. The relative seasonal biomass variability did not change for any group during re-oligotrophication. To conclude, HNF responded much more strongly and bacteria less so than chlorophyll concentrations to oligotrophication, whereas APP exhibited a more complex pattern.

After two year, the concentrations in the limed basin were somewhat lower than in the control (0.056-2.19 ng L(-1) and 0.129-2.65 ng L(-1), respectively). the highest concentrations were found in the anoxic hypolimnia. The total amount of MeHg in the water mass of the lake varied from 19 to 68 mg, showing a drop after spring and autumn overturns and a maximum during stratification period. The total Hg concentrations of fish in L. Iso Valkjarvi varied from 0.06 to 0.14 mu g g(-1) (ww) in whitefish to 0.1 to 0.7 mu g g(-1) in perch and 0.2 to 1.4 mu g g(-1) in pike. The total amount of MeHg bound in the fish of th lake was quite similar to that in the water column, 43 to 59 mg in 1990-1993, 33 to 47 mg of which was in the perch population.																			0049-6979					FEB	1995	80	1-4					577	580		10.1007/BF01189708	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01189708													WOS:A1995RM44200063
J	SEIP, KL				SEIP, KL			PHOSPHORUS AND NITROGEN LIMITATION OF ALGAL BIOMASS ACROSS TROPHIC GRADIENTS	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Regression results based on data from 46 northern temperate lakes show that total phosphorus (TP) is the best predictor for phytoplankton (as chl-a) at lower trophic levels, TP < 200 Mg . m-3. A regression including both TP and TN as regressors is the best predictor for lakes with TP > 200 mg . M-3. However, the good correlation is probably due to a high correlation between lake average chl-a (all years observed) and lake average TP and TN. Within single hypereutrophic lakes, TN alone is the best predictor. It was not possible to identify a medium trophic domain where TN and TP in combination was the best predictor for chl-a. The ratio TN:TP in the water decreases from about 40 to about 5 with increasing trophic level. Optimum TN:TP ratio for algal species with high abundance during late summer and autumn reflects this decreasing ratio, but within a lesser range, i.e., 20 to 5. In contrast, TN:TP ratios for species abundant during the early vernal period showed no, or an inverse, relation to the TN:TP ratio of the water.																			1015-1621	1420-9055					1994	56	1					16	28		10.1007/BF00877432	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00877432													WOS:A1994NA33900002

Coastal Sediment Dynamics and River Discharge as Key Factors Influencing Coastal Ecosystem Productivity in Southeastern Lake Michigan	OCEANOGRAPHY												A central question addressed by the Episodic Events in the Great Lakes Experiment (EEGLE) was the extent to which the spring phytoplankton bloom in southern Lake Michigan is influenced by a recurrent coastal turbidity plume that results from wind-driven sediment resuspension and transport. Findings from a series of studies conducted as part of EEGLE during spring in 1998, 1999, and 2000 confirmed the importance of sediment processes as a factor influencing ecosystem productivity in southeastern Lake Michigan, but also identified interannual variability in river discharge as potentially important in regulating productivity in coastal waters. Here, we describe the application of satellite-derived and in situ optical observations to examine the impacts of the recurrent coastal turbidity plume (RCP) on light availability and phytoplankton productivity. A review and synthesis of prior work highlighted findings that sediment resuspension during the 1998 El Nino period, a time of intense winter storm activity and an unusually strong RCP, profoundly influenced optical properties in coastal waters, constraining phytoplankton growth and primary production. In contrast, in 1999, a moderate RCP Coupled with relatively high discharge from the St. Joseph River led to a strong inner shelf optical signature indicative of elevated levels of dissolved organic matter and apparent enhancement of productivity. We speculate that future changes in climate are likely to alter sediment dynamics and river discharge with uncertain consequences for coastal ecosystem productivity and community structure in southeastern Lake Michigan as well as in other coastal systems.

J	Seebens, H; Einsle, U; Straile, D				Seebens, Hanno; Einsle, Ulrich; Straile, Dietmar			Copepod life cycle adaptations and success in response to phytoplankton spring bloom phenology	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												In a seasonal environment, the timing of reproduction is usually scheduled to maximize the survival of offspring. Within deep water bodies, the phytoplankton spring bloom provides a short time window of high food quantity and quality for herbivores. The onset of algal bloom development, however, varies strongly from year to year due to interannual variability in meteorological conditions. Furthermore, the onset is predicted to change with global warming. Here, we use a long-term dataset to study (a) how a cyclopoid copepod, Cyclops vicinus, is dealing with the large variability in phytoplankton bloom phenology, and (b) if bloom phenology has an influence on offspring numbers. C. vicinus performed a two-phase dormancy, that is, the actual diapause of fourth copepodid stages at the lake bottom is followed by a delay in maturation, that is, a quiescence, within the fifth copepodid stage until the start of the spring bloom. This strategy seems to guarantee a high temporal match of the food requirements for successful offspring development, especially through the highly vulnerable naupliar stages, with the phytoplankton spring bloom. However, despite this match with food availability in all study years, offspring numbers, that is, offspring survival rates were higher in years with an early start of the phytoplankton bloom. In addition, the phenology of copepod development suggested that also within study years, early offspring seems to have lower mortality rates than late produced offspring. We suggest that this is due to a longer predator-free time period and/or reduced time stress for development. Hence, within the present climate variability, the copepod benefited from warmer spring temperatures resulting in an earlier phytoplankton spring bloom. Time will show if the copepod's strategy is flexible enough to cope with future warming.

Over the years this marina has sustained significant damage from ice and harsh winter conditions. It has been rebuilt and the problems of earlier winters have been mitigated or eliminated. Battery Park's Marina management staff have developed and implemented a successful winter boat storage plan wherein boats are left in the ice (water) all winter. Data on winter conditions, dock designs, and operational procedures and costs are presented. Key to success is the daily monitoring of the boats and the deicing equipment. The in-water winter dockage generates a new profit-center for an under-used existing asset (the marina dockage and facilities), reduces the harmful effects of ice (uplift, thermal, and moving) on the dockage systems, and generates a pleasant winter visual effect of boats in the water surrounded by snow and ice.																					0-7844-0379-1				1998							467	478																WOS:000081048500044
J	Cardinale, M				Cardinale, M			Ontogenetic diet shifts of bull-rout, Myoxocephalus scorpius (L.), in the south-western Baltic Sea	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												The stomach contents of 533 bull-rout, Myoxocephalus scorpius (L.), were collected during February-March and October-November 1997 in the south-western Baltic Sea in order to study the feeding ecology and investigate diet changes between seasons and with the increasing size of the fish. The isopod Mesidotea entomon, and herring Clupea harengus, were the dominant species in the diet, accounting for 99% in weight of all bull-rout sampled in spring and autumn. Mysis mixta was frequent but less important in weight; analysis of the ontogenetic diet shift showed the presence of M, mixta essentially in the smaller size-classes. Herring was eaten almost exclusively by individuals larger than 21 cm total length; its importance increased with increasing size of bull-rout. The isopod M. entomon was abundant in all size-classes examined. Prey-size and the size of the principal prey, M. entomon, showed a significant increase with increasing bull-rout size. The diet shift from mysids to fish was followed by a change in the weight-length relationship. Cluster analysis confirmed two distinct size groups of > 26 cm and < 24 cm. In conclusion, the data indicate that the diet of bull-rout partially overlaps with that of herring in the first trophic stage, and with that of cod in the second part of the bull-rout life cycle.																			0175-8659	1439-0426				DEC	2000	16	6					231	239		10.1046/j.1439-0426.2000.00231.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0426.2000.00231.x													WOS:000166256800001

Nutrient and algal responses to a managed drawdown in an agricultural riverine lake	CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY												Water level of a shallow impounded riverine lake was lowered to help improve downstream flows and water quality within the Big Sunflower River in the agriculturally dominated Mississippi Delta, Mississippi, USA. A study was conducted to better understand how nutrient and algal processes within shallow lakes respond to relatively rapid water level changes to guide water resource management decisions. The drawdown was initiated in late summer and completed within six days, ending when outflow was <5% of peak flows. Water depths were reduced from 28-82%. Nutrients (phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon) and water column algal measurements (chlorophyll a, in-vivo chlorophyll, in-vivo phycocyanin, chlorophyll:phycocyanin ratio, and photosynthetic activity) were measured at three sites on days -7, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 13, 20, 28, and 34, relative to the start of the drawdown. Nitrogen and phosphorus responses were bimodal, showing a decrease during the initial drawdown phase followed by increasing levels in the ensuing weeks. Algal responses showed complex interactions between nutrients and changes in light availability that were often indirectly related to hydrologic changes. Late summer to early fall drawdowns in small impoundments used to improve downstream flows can have minimal water quality impacts on the upstream impounded systems.

In this study, we investigated whether there is a link between the late 1980s climate regime shift in Europe and the collapse of vendace (Coregonus albula) population at the same time in Lake Peipsi. Until the end of the 1980s, vendace was very abundant in the lake, but then its catches sharply declined. This decline inspired investigations into the extreme weather events preceding the vendace collapse using data on daily water temperatures and ice phenology together with commercial fishery statistics since 1931 and test catch data since 1986. We identified using advanced statistical methods that the hot summer of 1988, which was accompanied by a severe cyanobacterial bloom and extensive fish kill, and the subsequent non-permanent ice cover and early ice-offs in 1989 and 1990 in Lake Peipsi were the main reasons for the disappearance of vendace from catches in 1991. Moreover, a negative correlation appeared between catches of the predatory pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) and vendace. Predation pressure as well as fish habitat degradation caused by lake eutrophication may contribute to the instability of the vendace population too. Our study showed that extreme weather events such as heat waves in summer and non-permanent ice-cover in winter in consecutive years may have long-lasting harmful effects on the population abundance of cool-water fish species such as vendace whose eggs usually develop under an ice cover in north-temperate lakes.

The extensive agriculture, housing and plantation forestry (afforestation from 7% to 97%) dominate in the landuse in catchments. All investigated rivers were characterized by similar hydrological regime and relatively high natural level of organic matter in waters (10 mg DOC dm(-3)). The autumn 2000 drought in Poland was one of the most severe in many years when the monthly sum of precipitation in October made only 6% of average long-term norm for the region. Significant differences in concentrations of investigated chemical parameters were noted between results from wet (1996-1998) and dry (2000) autumn periods. Concentrations of ions derived from non-point sources increased in many locations, which was confirmed by increases in Ca, and HCO3 concentrations. Average dissolved organic carbon concentrations, and water colour were two times higher in the wetter autumn than in dry period. The hydrological drought in autumn 2000 caused significant decrease in the range of DOC concentrations (about 30%). The largest difference in DOC concentrations between the wet autumn period and extremely dry one were recorded in the rivers flowing through dense forests. Our results indicate that dissolved organic carbon in most natural catchments decreased as a result of the lack of dilution. Some more natural north-east Polish rivers gradually lost contact with their catchments, and ecotone zones did not play an important role in supplying organic matter to rivers during droughts. Most of river and catchment morphological parameters became less important in shaping the amounts of DOC in rivers. The current study indicates that small and medium rivers were not resistant in hydrochemical terms to flow decreases what has environmental consequences for transport of nutrients, organic matter and finally on sediments, flora and fauna habitats.

Spatial, Seasonal, and Diel Controls of Nitrogen-Carbon-Oxygen Cycling During Lake-Water Infiltration to an Aquifer	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Many freshwater lakes are groundwater flow-through systems. Although lakes commonly are considered to be sinks for nitrogen inputs, relatively little is known about carbon and nitrogen export from lakes to groundwater. The current study focused on lake-bottom biogeochemical processes accompanying the transport of nitrogen, dissolved oxygen (O2), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) during lake-water recharge from a groundwater flow-through lake. Lake-water and porewater (15-100 cm below lakebed) samples were collected along transects within the lake downwelling zone. Infiltrating porewater O2 and DOC concentrations decreased with depth while nitrate (NO3-) concentrations increased, indicating nitrification of organic matter within the profiles. The depth of NO3- production and transport was seasonally dependent. In winter, NO3- and O2 were exported beyond 100-cm depth; whereas in summer, shallow nitrification zones were underlain by deeper NO3- reduction zones, and diel patterns of O2 and NO3- penetration depths were observed. Microbial community compositions and stable isotope profiles (delta 15N[NO3-], delta 18O[NO3-], delta 18O[O2]) were consistent with apparent C-N-O reaction stoichiometries indicating O2 reduction and nitrification in shallower porewater, followed by varying NO3- reduction at depth. Maximum porewater NO3- concentrations (similar to 10-20 mu M) were limited by infiltrating O2 concentrations and C/N ratios of reacting organic matter. Lake-water level variations caused changes in shoreline position and porewater velocities, while variations in lake-water temperature, DOC, and O2 contributed to changes in reaction rates and depth of O2 and NO3- penetration into the lakebed. The quality of groundwater recharged by lake water reflected temporally and spatially varying physical and biogeochemical processes in the sediment porewater. This study examined what happens to the chemistry of lake water (LW) that is seeping downward through lakebed sediment and into groundwater in a moderately productive lake. Although nitrate was rarely present in the LW, it was produced in the lakebed sediment by the decomposition of organic matter produced in the lake. The amount of nitrate produced and whether it was subsequently removed in deeper sediment depended on the timing (summer vs. winter, and night vs. day) and location (nearshore vs. offshore) of the downwelling water. This study demonstrated that nitrate can be exported from lakes to groundwater, even when it is not present in the LW, but the fluxes of nitrate and other redox-sensitive constituents may be variable and heterogeneously distributed in the downgradient groundwater. Lake-level variations control spatial and temporal variations in lake-water infiltration fluxes Varying lake chemistry, porewater velocity, temperature, and infiltration zone reactions cause heterogeneous groundwater chemistry OM mineralization is associated with nitrate production and consumption rates as lake-water infiltrates through the lakebed to groundwater					Smith, Richard/A-6733-2008	Smith, Richard/0000-0002-3829-0125; Hull, Robert/0000-0002-0216-5250; Reed, Ariel/0000-0002-0792-5204; Kent, Douglas/0000-0003-3758-8322; LeBlanc, Denis/0000-0002-4646-2628; Bohlke, John Karl/0000-0001-5693-6455													2169-8953	2169-8961				APR	2024	129	4							e2023JG007659	10.1029/2023JG007659	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023JG007659													WOS:001197267400001

Mean annual inflow wastewater nutrient concentrations were 17 mg L(-1) NH(3)-N, 30 mg L(-1) NO(3)-N and 11 mg L(-1) SRP. Mean flows greater than 5000 m(3) day(-1) loaded the marsh with 23 000 kg of P annually. Summer NH(3)-N, NO(3)-N and total phosphorus (TP) surface water concentrations were decreased by 76, 87 and 64%, respectively, as waters flowed through the first basin of the marsh. Winter treatment was less successful, with surface water NH(3)-N, NO(3)-N and TP reductions of 46, -26 (export) and 26%, respectively. Short-circuiting of water flow through the marsh and cold seasonal conditions with ice cover caused spatial and temporal variation in marsh treatment. Continued high loadings to the marsh may lead to sediment saturation, eutrophication or phosphorus export from the marsh.

We captured five species: meadow vole, montane vole, deer mouse, vagrant shrew, and ermine. Populations of meadow and montane voles irrupted in 1998, then declined to 1997 levels in 1999 and 2000. Capture rates of vagrant shrews were higher in 1998 and 2000 than in 1997 and 1999. Capture rates for ermine were highest in 1998 and 1999 and lowest in 1997 and 2000. The ratio of capture rates of prey species (montane and meadow voles, vagrant shrew, and deer mouse) to that of ermine increased from 5.20 in 1997 to 13.18 in 1998, declined to 0.77 in 1999, and rebounded in 2000 to 7.95. We detected no differences in capture rates among three land management treatments (idle, fall grazing, and fall burning) for any species, but captures rates were relatively low during the two post-treatment years. We found no evidence that amount of litter or vegetation type (>50% green vs. other) affected capture rates for any species. The effect of soil wetness varied by year for deer mice and ermine. Long-term studies, conducted over several microtine cycles and a range of environmental conditions, are needed to better understand the role of small mammals in wet meadow communities.

These formulations are permanently introduced into the aquatic environment during regular use, mainly through municipal sewage treatment plants. Although there is increasing concern about PCP residues in the aquatic environment, little is known about the extent and level of contamination. The occurrence and concentrations of the seven most frequently used ultraviolet (UV) filters in river and lake sediments have been investigated over a 6-month period by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry: benzophenone-3 (BP-3), 3-benzyliden camphor (3-BC), butyl-methoxydibenzoylmethane (B-MDM), ethylhexyl dimethyl p-aminobenzoic acid (ED-PABA), ethylhexyl-methoxycinnamate (EHMC), 3'-(4'-methylbenzyliden)camphor (4-MBC) and octocrylene (OCR). B-MDM, EHMC and OCR were identified as major contaminants. They were present in every sediment sample with maximum concentrations of 62.2, 6.8 and 642 mu g kg(-1). 3-BC and ED-PABA could not be detected in any sediment sample. The temporal distribution profile and concentrations of UV filters differed between lakes and rivers. Whereas concentrations of all UV filters in river sediments were low and constant over time, lake sediments exhibited high UV-filter levels during summer and concentrations dropped in autumn. These findings support risk assessment activities and contribute to a better understanding of the magnitude of contamination with organic UV-filter substances in aquatic ecosystems.

J	WIKNER, J; HAGSTROM, A				WIKNER, J; HAGSTROM, A			ANNUAL STUDY OF BACTERIOPLANKTON COMMUNITY DYNAMICS	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Bacterial growth, abundance, and grazing were measured simultaneously during a full seasonal cycle in a temperate brackish water estuary, covering diel and seasonal variability. Growth of bacteria was balanced by bacterivory on an annual basis, and observed net change in bacterial numbers matched the net change calculated by a simple Lotka-Volterra equation lacking immigration or emigration terms. Bacterial growth was dependent on water temperature below 6-degrees-C, but other factors dominated at higher temperatures. The community clearance rate of the bacterivores was stringently regulated at 0.6 d-1, showing a linear functional response within the range of natural bacterial abundances recorded. Furthermore, bacterivores showed a threshold at 7 x 10(5) bacteria ml-1 when grazing ceased, suggesting that pelagic bacteria have a numerical refuge promoting coexistence with bacterivores in aquatic environments. The observed lack of timing between bacterial growth and grazing in spring allowed accumulation of bacterial cells, but grazing exceeded growth in winter. We inferred that the specific growth rate of the bacterial community and the community clearance rate of bacterivores together determined change in and abundance of bacterioplankton in the waters examined.

J	Holzer, K; Brukner, P				Holzer, K; Brukner, P			Screening of athletes for exercise-induced bronchoconstriction	CLINICAL JOURNAL OF SPORT MEDICINE												Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) has a high prevalence in elite athletes, particularly endurance athletes, winter athletes and swimmers. Recent studies have shown that a clinical diagnosis of EIB has only a moderate sensitivity and specificity for EIB. This finding in conjunction with a recent ruling by the IOC-medical commission that all athletes competing in initially the 2003 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, and now the 2004 Summer Olympic Games in Athens require objective evidence of EIB, support the need for bronchial provocation challenge tests in the diagnosis of EIB. The recommended bronchial provocation challenge test is the eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea (EVH) challenge; this challenge test has been shown to have both a high sensitivity and specificity for EIB. Pharmacological challenge tests, such as the methacholine challenge test, have been shown to have only a low sensitivity but high specificity for EIB in elite athletes, and are thus not recommended in the athlete with pure EIB. Exercise challenge tests performed both in the laboratory and field have a high specificity for EIB; however those in the laboratory have only a moderate sensitivity for EIB in elite athletes, whilst those in the field are limited by problems with standardization. The osmotic challenge tests, such as the hypertonic saline and newer inhaled dry powder mannitol challenge have both a high sensitivity and specificity for EIB, and may be used as an alternative to the EVH challenge.																			1050-642X	1536-3724				MAY	2004	14	3					134	138		10.1097/00042752-200405000-00005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00042752-200405000-00005								15166901					WOS:000230327200005

Sulfide Generated by Sulfate Reduction is a Primary Controller of the Occurrence of Wild Rice (Zizania palustris) in Shallow Aquatic Ecosystems	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Field observations suggest that surface water sulfate concentrations control the distribution of wild rice, an aquatic grass (Zizania palustris). However, hydroponic studies show that sulfate is not toxic to wild rice at even unrealistically high concentrations. To determine how sulfate might directly or indirectly affect wild rice, potential wild rice habitat was characterized for 64 chemical and physical variables in over 100 sites spanning a relatively steep climatic and geological gradient in Minnesota. Habitat suitability was assessed by comparing the occurrence of wild rice with the field variables, through binary logistic regression. This analysis demonstrated that sulfide in sediment pore water, generated by the microbial reduction of sulfate that diffuses or advects into the sediment, is the primary control of wild rice occurrence. Water temperature and water transparency independently control the suitability of habitat for wild rice. In addition to generating phytotoxic sulfide, sulfate reduction also supports anaerobic decomposition of organic matter, releasing nutrients that can compound the harm of direct sulfide toxicity. These results are important because they show that increases in sulfate loading to surface water can have multiple negative consequences for ecosystems, even though sulfate itself is relatively benign. Plain Language Summary Research in the 1940s and 1950s found that wild rice grew best in low-sulfate Minnesota lakes, but it was not known why. The correlation was a puzzle, since sulfate is not very toxic to plants or animals. This study found that the problem is sulfide, not sulfate. Sulfate can be converted into toxic levels of sulfide in the soil in which wild rice germinates and roots. Wild rice is an annual plant that must sprout each spring from seed that was dropped the previous fall into wet soil. Anaerobic microbes in the soil make sulfide from sulfate in the overlying water. Lakes, streams, and wetlands that have high concentrations of dissolved sulfide in the sediment therefore have a low probability of hosting wild rice. The study also found that wild rice prefers high-transparency water and cold winters.

J	Lair, N; Picard, V				Lair, N; Picard, V			The effects of Chilomonas on the life history traits of Daphnia longispina under semi-natural conditions and the implications for competition in the plankton	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Assuming that heterotrophic flagellates (H.F.) can sustain cladoceran life cycles, particularly at periods of low food and high detritus conditions, the growth, reproduction and life span of Daphnia longispina were studied under conditions of summer food limitation. They were fed both natural resources and natural food enriched with a culture of the colourless Chilomonas (ovoid cell, 8 x 25 mu m). Four H.F. morphotypes occurred in the natural water and the first experiments with Daphnia, showed that the cladoceran would most easily ingest those of 5 mu m-10 mu m, while the addition of Chilomonas severely depressed the H.F. of 2 mu m. The capability of this flagellate to ingest small H.F. was confirmed using fluorescent particles ranging from 0.94 to 3.95 mu m. As a consequence, Daphnia could control the abundance of H.F., but also compete with the largest morphotypes. To study the influence of the H.F. on the life span of Daphnia, the cladoceran was acclimated for two generations, before the start of the experiments. In semi-natural conditions, constant temperature, without predators and fed natural water, the summer daphnids achieved smaller sizes, produced fewer offspring and lived for a shorter time than when Chilomonas was added to their diet. Despite the addition of 560 mu g C l(-1), this was not sufficient to enhance the Daphnia reproduction to the level of the spring population fed natural water. These results clearly illustrate that the heterotrophic flagellates contributed significantly to improving the reproduction and survival of the daphnids. They emphasise the importance of the microbial loop as a link to larger consumers, particularly when unpalatable or nutritionally inadequate algae are dominant, which is often so in lakes during summer.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2000	429	1-3					79	87		10.1023/A:1004072513575	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004072513575													WOS:000088588300007
J	Zheng, JY; Ding, LL; Hao, ZX; Ge, QS				Zheng, Jingyun; Ding, Lingling; Hao, Zhixin; Ge, Quansheng			Extreme cold winter events in southern China during AD 1650-2000	BOREAS												We defined extreme cold winter events as those with occurrence probabilities lower than the 10th percentile of the probability density function, based on observed winter temperatures in southern China since 1951. Subsequently, we constructed impact severity levels using documentary evidence for those events during 1951-2000, considering three indexes for the freezing of rivers/lakes, widespread snow/ice storms, and cold damage to subtropical/tropical crops. Using these criteria we identified 50 extreme cold winters for the period AD 1650-1949 based on similar to 4000 pieces of comparable information extracted from local gazettes in southern China, after verification using data from three weather stations with long records. It was found that the frequencies of the extreme cold winter events since 1650 varied over time. The most frequent occurrences were found during AD 1650-1699 and in the first and second halves of the 19th century, with frequencies twice as high as in the second half of the 20th century. In contrast, the frequencies of extreme winters during the 18th century were close to that in the second half of the 20th century. High frequencies of extreme cold winters in AD 1650-1720 and AD 1795-1835 occurred during the sunspot Maunder and Dalton Minima. The intensities of some historical cold events, such as those during 1653-1654, 1670, 1690, 1861, 1892 and 1929, exceeded those of the coldest winter events since 1951.					; Zheng, Jingyun/M-5789-2015	Ge, Quansheng/0000-0001-8712-8565; 													0300-9483	1502-3885				JAN	2012	41	1					1	12		10.1111/j.1502-3885.2011.00225.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1502-3885.2011.00225.x													WOS:000298087500001
J	Gudbergsson, G				Gudbergsson, G			Arctic charr in Lake Myvatn: The centennial catch record in the light of recent stock estimates	AQUATIC ECOLOGY					International TWIN Symposium on Cold Aquatic Environments	2002	Myvatn, ICELAND	Myvatn Res Stn, Nord Benthol Soc				In Lake Myvatn, Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) is economically the most important fish species. It is fast growing fish and its size at maturity is 35-50 cm at the age of 4 to 5 years. Catch statistics that are available for the whole 20th century show considerable long-term variation with the highest catch in the 1920s. The catches after 1970 are about 40% lower than the average from 1930-1969 and the annual catches for the last decade are the lowest. Stock size during the winter fishing season fluctuated considerably between years, with average annual fishing mortality of 83.9%. The Arctic charr population has been monitored annually since 1986, using standard series of gill nets of different mesh sizes. In 1988 one to three-year-old fish were heavily reduced in numbers during the summer months. There are indications of a similar event in 1997. In both years the charr changed its main diet from Cladocera and chironomid midges to three-spined sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus and snails. At the same time its condition deteriorated. The catch in the monitoring fishery in Lake Myvatn correlates with the stock size in the beginning of the following winter fishing season deduced from Leslie's method and can give prospects for the fishery in the successive fishing season. An index of abundance of young charr also correlates with the number of chironomids and cladocerans and also with ducklings that feed on the same food as the charr. Large fluctuations in the Arctic charr population in Lake Myvatn seem to be related to changes in the main food species. The catch records available from Lake Myvatn can to a large extent be used as a measure of changes of the Arctic charr population in the lake for the past century.

Titan's Meteorology Over the Cassini Mission: Evidence for Extensive Subsurface Methane Reservoirs	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Cassini observations of Titan's weather patterns over >13years, almost half a Saturnian year, provide insight into seasonal circulation patterns and the methane cycle. The Imaging Science Subsystem and the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer documented cloud locations, characteristics, morphologies, and behavior. Clouds were generally more prevalent in the summer hemisphere, but there were surprises in locations and timing of activity: Southern clouds were common at midlatitudes, northern clouds initially appeared much sooner than model predictions, and north polar summer convective systems did not appear before the mission ended. Differences from expectations constrain atmospheric circulation models, revealing factors that best match observations, including the roles of surface and subsurface reservoirs. The preference for clouds at mid-northern latitudes rather than near the pole is consistent with models that include widespread polar near-surface methane reservoirs in addition to the lakes and seas, suggesting a broader subsurface methane table is accessible to the atmosphere. Plain Language Summary We monitored methane clouds in the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan for over 13 years, using images from the Cassini spacecraft. The observations cover almost half of Titan's year, showing how weather patterns changed from late southern summer to northern summer (approximately mid-January through late June on Earth). During southern summer, extensive clouds and, on one occasion, rainfall were observed near Titan's south pole. But surprisingly, this weather pattern did not repeat at the north pole in northern summer. By comparing weather observations to atmospheric models, we can determine sources for the moisture in the atmosphere. Our analysis shows that, in addition to Titan's lakes and seas, there may also be liquid beneath the surface near both poles. This result is consistent with other evidence that suggests there may be underground connections between some of the lakes and seas. Knowing there may be more liquid below Titan's surface helps explain how methane is supplied to the atmosphere and how Titan's methane cycle works (similar to Earth's water cycle: evaporation, cloud formation, rain, and surface collection into rivers, lakes, and oceans). With the end of the Cassini mission, Earth-based telescopes will continue to watch for large clouds on Titan.

Seasonal mercury concentrations in plankton-net material from a contaminated coastal lagoon (Ria de Aveiro, Portugal)	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												Seasonal mercury accumulation was studied in material collected with 63 and 200 mu m mesh size zooplankton nets. Results indicate that zooplankton abundance is not directly affected by mercury contamination, but rather by parameters such as salinity and temperature. Mercury levels reached as high as 25 mg kg(-1), corresponding to 10(7) times the dissolved mercury concentrations and suggesting a high affinity of zooplankton and associated lithogenic particles for this metal. Two seasonal enrichment moments were observed, one in the winter period which corresponded to an increase of suspended mercury-rich particles from the contaminated area due to increased water flow, and another in summer reflecting mercury bioaccumulation by zooplankton in this high-density period. Our results suggest this fraction (>200 mu m taxocenosis) could be very important in the overall mercury cycle in estuaries, since it can be a transporting agent to other areas of the system or to the open sea, and also could play a key role in mercury bio-amplification processes along estuarine food webs.

Phenological Diversity of Salmon Smolt Migration Timing within a Large Watershed	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Although there is growing concern that climate change might drive phenological mismatches between predators and prey, it is possible that within- and among-species phenological variation provides resilience against such a mismatch. One key life history event that may be vulnerable to climate-induced mismatch is the seaward migration of juvenile salmon relative to the spring bloom of their marine zooplankton prey. Here, we quantified phenological diversity of out-migration timing among salmon populations within a large watershed and its implications for climate mismatches with marine zooplankton. Specifically, we sampled juvenile Sockeye Salmon Oncorhynchus nerka throughout the spring and early summer in the estuary of the Skeena River, a vast watershed with numerous locally adapted salmon populations that support commercial, recreational, and First Nations fisheries, and we used genetic stock identification to link the fish to their population of origin. We found that Sockeye Salmon were migrating through the estuary for more than 50d, with peak emigration for different populations varying by over 5weeks. The out-migration timing of specific populations was related to geographic factors, including elevation of the rearing lake and theriver distance between individual rearing lakes and the estuary, with different populations arriving 1.5d later for every 100m of elevation or 3d later for every 100km of river distance. Concurrent with sampling, we quantified the estuarine prey of juvenile Sockeye Salmon; zooplankton species composition and abundance varied throughout the smolt migration period, and the different salmon populations encountered different prey abundances upon ocean entry. Together, these results indicate underappreciated phenological diversity in this harvested metapopulation, which may contribute to response diversity and metapopulation-level resilience to climate change.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				SEP	2018	147	5					775	790		10.1002/tafs.10068	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tafs.10068													WOS:000444682900001
J	Mohamed, ZA				Mohamed, Zakaria A.			Toxic cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins in public hot springs in Saudi Arabia	TOXICON												Toxic cyanobacteria are well reported in rivers, lakes and even marine environments, but the toxin production of cyanobacteria in hot springs is largely unexplored. Therefore, the present study investigated the presence of toxic cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins in public hot springs in Saudi Arabia. The results of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed that Saudi spring cyanobacterial mats contained microcystins (MCYSTs) at concentrations ranging from 468 to 512.5 mu g g(-1). The Limulus amebocyte lystae (LAL) assay detected lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxins in these mats at concentrations ranging from 433.3 to 506.8 EU g(-1). MCYSTs and endotoxins were also detected in spring waters at levels of 5.7 mu gl(-1) and 640 EU ml(-1), respectively, exceeding WHO's provisional guideline value for MCYST-LR in drinking-water. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis revealed that only Oscillatoria limosa and Synechococcus lividus can produce MCYSTs with a profile consisting of MCYST-RR and -LR. Based on the LAL assay, 12 out of 17 cyanobacterial species contained LPS at concentrations ranging from, 0.93 to 21.06 EU g(-1). However, not all LPS of these species were toxic to mice. This study suggests that the hot springs in the world including Saudi Arabia should be screened for toxic cyanobacteria to avoid the exposure of people recreating and bathing in spring waters to cyanobacterial toxins.

Multi-year three-dimensional simulation of seasonal variation in phytoplankton species composition in a large shallow lake	OCEAN MODELLING												Lake Erie has been negatively impacted by multiple stressors, including nutrient enrichment and climate change, that have exacerbated eutrophication and harmful algal blooms. Management of these long-term water quality problems requires numerical models that can be run over years to decades. The three-dimensional hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry models applied to date, however, have not been tested for continuous runs longer than one year and have not been shown to accurately reproduce seasonal variation in phytoplankton species composition (e.g., the development of harmful algal blooms) over decadal timescales. We simulated the threedimensional nutrient and phytoplankton concentrations in western Lake Erie continuously from 2002 to 2014. Using a single parameter set, we were able to reproduce both seasonal and inter -annual variation in phytoplankton species composition. The model qualitatively reproduced the observed seasonal succession (i.e., variation in phytoplankton species composition), including the spring diatom bloom and late summer cyanobacterial growth. This study demonstrates that three-dimensional models can be applied for multi -year simulations of nutrients and phytoplankton to inform large lake research and management.																			1463-5003	1463-5011				JUN	2024	189								102374	10.1016/j.ocemod.2024.102374	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2024.102374		MAY 2024											WOS:001240675500001

Since the water level dropped below the gage in 2004, the ICESAT-MODIS (ICEM)-based lake water levels could not be compared with gage levels. Instead, combined use of Landsat satellite based lake surface area studies and Aksehir Lake bathymetry (LAB) enabled ICEM assessment. ICEM and LAB differences are between -0.09m and 0.32m and close to the standard deviations (s.d.) of pure ICESat-based studies (0.02m-0.27m). The minimum and maximum water surface elevation changes of ICEM between consecutive winter and spring are 0.30m and 1.35m and are in the historical range.

WINTER IN TOMIS AND "WINTER" IN HELL: ONCE MORE ABOUT THE PARALLELS BETWEEN DANTE AND OVID	STUDIA LITTERARUM												Among the probable sources of "winter" imagery in the last cantos of Inferno a special place belongs to the motif of Scythian winter, developed in detail by Ovid in his "exile poetry" and (before him) by Virgil in the Georgics (III). Despite the absence of direct mentions of Tristia and Epistulae Ex Ponto in Dante's oeuvre, the majority of modern scholars challenge the statement of E. Moore, who suggested in the late 19th century that later writings by Ovid created in exile may have remained unknown to the author of the Divine Comedy. In correlation with the view of Michelangelo Picone, who, beside tracing the characteristics of Ovid's winter, also saw in Dante's wintry parts of Hell a reconsideration of the motif of exile (central to Tristia), the author of the article examines the most important parallels, uniting the Commedia's first cantica with Ovid's "exile" verses, namely the description of the solidity of ice covering the river or lake; the hero-author walking on the ice and gazing at beings bound in it; the correlation between winter's dominance and the escalation of hostility in the relations of persons and tribes; the connection of winter's setting with the motifs of "death-in-the-life" and the loss of spiritual home; a longing for spiritual Absolute under the reign of winter; potential ambiguousness of "winter" motifs.					; Chesnokova, Tatiana/JMB-1174-2023	Chesnokova, Tatiana/0000-0001-9326-4520; 													2500-4247	2541-8564					2022	7	2					40	61		10.22455/2500-4247-2022-7-2-40-61	http://dx.doi.org/10.22455/2500-4247-2022-7-2-40-61													WOS:000876453300003
J	Falk, M				Falk, Martin			The sensitivity of winter tourism to exchange rate changes: Evidence for the Swiss Alps	TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY RESEARCH												This paper investigates the impact of the appreciation of the Swiss franc on international tourism in Swiss Alpine resorts, city and lake destinations using annual data for winter seasons 2007/2008 to 2010/2011. Using median regression models, we find that the nominal and real appreciation of the Swiss franc has a large and significantly negative impact on international tourism demand in Alpine destinations during winter months. The elasticities of the relative price (to those of competing countries) range between -3.0 for foreign hotel nights and -2.1 for foreign hotel arrivals. In contrast, the real exchange rate effect is much lower in absolute terms for city and lake destinations. The results are not sensitive with respect to different measures of international tourism demand (arrivals, hotel nights and the length of stay). Income elasticities are also significant and large with values of two and higher. In general, these findings are robust to alternative estimation methods (i.e., median regression, robust regression method and ordinary least squares in first differences).

Roach were caught from three interconnected lakes in Central Finland. Nine Dactylogyrus species were found. Of these the seven most abundant were used for studying the abundance of species on different gill-arches, niche breadth and niche overlap between the species. It was found that all species had a species-specific preference for certain gill-arches. The total abundances of all the species went through distinct seasonal changes, peaking during the spring and early summer. Some seasonal variation was also exhibited in gill-arch preferences. Niche breadth and species overlap were mostly higher during the period of peak occurrence of the various species, but in the case of some species they appeared to be unrelated to abundance, indicating possible niche restriction by other species. Most significant was the restriction of D. micracanthus to the fourth gill-arch during the period of peak occurrence of D. similis. Experimental work is needed to verify the reasons for variations in the microhabitat distribution of certain Dactylogyrus species.																			0031-1820	1469-8161				APR	1992	104		2				273	281		10.1017/S0031182000061710	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182000061710													WOS:A1992HQ36500009
J	Qin, XM; Xia, W; Hu, XX; Shao, Z				Qin, Xuemin; Xia, Wei; Hu, Xiaoxuan; Shao, Zhen			Dynamic variations of cyanobacterial blooms and their response to urban development and climate change in Lake Chaohu based on Landsat observations	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Recurring cyanobacterial blooms have seriously hindered the sustainable development of cities. In this study, the variation trend of cyanobacterial blooms was analyzed by taking Lake Chaohu in China as the study area, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from Landsat observations combined with the development index of surrounding cities from 2009 to 2019 was used to quantitatively analyze the response of cyanobacterial blooms to urban development and climate change. The results showed that the NDVI of the Northwest Lake region was significantly higher than that of other regions. Summer and autumn were the main seasons for the outbreak of cyanobacterial blooms. The NDVI of Lake Chaohu and Baohe Lake region showed a significant correlation with the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of Hefei city (HF), the districts and counties around the lake (DCL), Baohe District (BH), and the population (P). As the economic regions gradually focused on BH rather than on HF and DCL, there was an increasing trend correlation between the NDVI of Baohe Lake region and the GDP growth rate. However, the elimination of GDP in BH did not affect the consistency relationship between the economic growth of other regions and the NDVI of Lake Chaohu on a large scale. In addition, the results of relative importance analysis indicated that the GDP growth rate of BH and the area of Hefei except DCL (HF-DCL) accounted for important contribution to the R-2 of the regression. This study has momentous reference value for understanding the coupling relationship between urban development and lake environment.						, zhen/0000-0002-2968-6048													0944-1344	1614-7499				MAY	2022	29	22					33152	33166		10.1007/s11356-022-18616-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-18616-1		JAN 2022						35028848					WOS:000742344700005

The results obtained showed seasonal differences, especially in spring. The high values of the abundance of heterotrophs in winter are related to human activity at the sampling stations. Screening for four types of extracellular hydrolytic enzyme with potential for degradation of organic matter (amylases, lipases, proteases and cellulases) led to the conclusion that lipolytic bacteria were dominant in the studied ecosystems, while proteolytic bacteria were observed in low numbers, but were present in urbanized areas. The presence of cellulolytic bacteria is correlated with the development of macrophytic vegetation. The aim of the present study was oriented towards the evaluation of the anthropogenic input in several lakes surrounding Bucharest in the Nord-Eastern region. These urban ecosystems are generated as a requirement of city development. The microbiological and general enzymatic approaches generated some novel results concerning the pollution degree of aquatic urban ecosystems and could be considered as a platform for further investigation.

Each nearshore area was sampled along a transect moving from the river mouth, through the mixing zone, toward the offshore waters. Samples for unfiltered, filtered and particulate Hg-T and MeHg, SPM, DOC and chl-a were collected from each transect site. The TAQ was re-sampled in Spring 2002 and size-specific seston was also collected from the water column at the mouth and offshore sites. Concentrations of SPM, DOC, unfiltered, filtered and particulate HgT and MeHg generally decreased between the river mouth and the offshore site of each mixing zone. Decreases in concentrations were presumably the result of dilution as concentrated river water mixed with pristine lake water, or fallout of larger particles with distance. Chl-a appeared to be unaffected by dilution and remained either constant or increased along each transect. Despite the observed decreases in MeHg species in the water column, the amount of MeHg retained on particles always increased along the same transect with a maximum reached in the offshore site. Large increases in the log K-d for MeHg, and the biological enrichment in the SPM pool in the offshore waters, suggest that MeHg is strongly bioaccumulated in these riverine mixing zones.

A total of 161 taxa were identified from collections made during a research program conducted in the summers of 1974, 1975 and 1976. Of these taxa Arnica louiseana var. frigida, Draba lactea, Lupinus kuschei, Oxytropis huddelsonii, Poa lettermanii, Senecio sheldonensis, S. yukonensis and Stellaria longipes var. edwardsii had a restricted or otherwise interesting distribution in British Columbia. Preliminary observations indicated that the local distribution of all taxa was controlled by 3 environmental gradients: snow duration, moisture and topography. Five different alpine habitat types were recognized as a result of different combinations of these gradients. These habitat types were fell-fields and boulder fields, meadows and shrub fields, snow beds, seepage sites, and drainage areas. The habitat types and relative abundance of each taxon were listed.																			0008-4026						1977	55	10					1399	1409		10.1139/b77-162	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b77-162													WOS:A1977DH72500016

These were conducted during stable flow conditions within the Krycklan catchment study area in northern Sweden. During each campaign, about 80 individual locations were measured for discharge draining from catchment areas ranging between 0.12 and 67 km(2). These discharge samplings allowed for the comparison between years within a given season (September 2005 versus September 2008) and between seasons within a given year (May 2008 versus September 2008) of specific discharge across this boreal landscape. There was considerable variability in specific discharge across this landscape. The ratio of the interquartile range (IQR) defined as the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles of the specific discharges to the median of the specific discharges ranged from 37% to 43%. Factor analysis was used to explore potential relations between landscape characteristics and the specific discharge observed for 55 of the individual locations that were measured in all three synoptic sampling campaigns. Percentage wet area (i.e., wetlands, mires, and lakes) and elevation were found to be directly related to the specific discharge during the drier September 2008 sampling while potential annual evaporation was found to be inversely related. There was less of a relationship determined during the wetter post spring flood May 2008 sampling and the late summer rewetted September 2005 sampling. These results indicate the ability of forests to "dry out" parts of the catchment over the summer months while wetlands "keep wet" other parts. To demonstrate the biogeochemical implications of such spatiotemporal variations in specific discharge, we estimate dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exports with available data for the May 2008 and September 2008 samplings using both the spatially variable observed specific discharges and the spatially constant catchment average values. The average absolute difference in DOC export for the various subcatchments between using a variable and using a constant specific discharge was 28% for the May 2008 sampling and 20% for the September 2008 sampling.

Cutting grass on desert islands: genetic structure of disjunct coastal and central Australian populations of Gahnia trifida (Cyperaceae)	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Great Artesian Basin (GAB) springs in central Australia support several plant species otherwise not found in the arid zone. Evolutionary theory predicts that isolated populations will experience reductions in gene flow and genetic diversity, and higher levels of inbreeding. Our aim was to test this prediction by comparing the genetic structure of cutting grass, Gahnia trifida, (Cyperaceae) on disjunct GAB springs with coastal populations that have experienced recent fragmentation. Location Naturally isolated GAB springs near Lake Eyre, central Australia, and coastal sites in southern Australia. Methods We used 13 microsatellite markers to genotype 267 samples from six GAB spring and four coastal G. trifida populations. These data were used to estimate population genetic statistics and contemporary and historical measures of gene flow in the two regions. Results GAB spring populations display lower levels of genetic diversity compared with coastal populations. Furthermore, GAB spring populations displayed much higher levels of genetic differentiation (FST=0.52) than populations at coastal sites (FST=0.22). Several coastal populations exhibited historical genetic connectivity, whereas analysis of molecular variation (AMOVA) and contemporary migration rate estimates indicate that populations from GAB spring groups are demographically independent. Main conclusions Divergence estimates based on microsatellite data suggest restriction of central Australian G. trifida populations to refugial spring habitats since at least 1528ka, a period that spans the Last Glacial Maximum. Dispersal amongst spring groups is insufficient to counteract the effect of genetic drift, leading to a loss of genetic diversity. Species persisting in isolated or fragmented habitats are likely to suffer adverse effects on genetic traits, potentially increasing their risk of extinction.					; Mackay, Duncan/A-9966-2011; Clarke, Laurence/N-3579-2017	Whalen, Molly/0000-0002-1583-5030; Mackay, Duncan/0000-0002-3326-7612; Clarke, Laurence/0000-0002-0844-4453													0305-0270	1365-2699				JUN	2013	40	6					1071	1081		10.1111/jbi.12066	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.12066													WOS:000319218600006

This study involves the analysis of the photolytic behavior of some representative petroleum biomarkers, bicyclic sesqui-terpanes (BSs), admantanes (ADs), diamantanes (DAs), and mono-and triaromatic steranes (MASs and TASs), by exposing Cold Lake Blend (CLB) and Alberta Sweet Mixed Blend (MSW) to winter and summer insolation after being spilled onto artificial brines. Aromatic steranes in all control samples remained relatively stable, whereas the biomarkers of BSs, ADs, and DAs were less stable. Similar to the exhaustive loss of the C10-C17 alkanes, 91%- 99% of BSs, ADs, and DAs were lost after five days of insolation, especially in summer. Both MASs and TASs were lost gradually in most scenarios, although both of them were lost faster in MSW than observed for CLB. The removal of MASs and TASs did not differ significantly from each other, although their loss was less than observed for PAHs having similar number of rings and greater than for the C21-C33 n-alkanes. Therefore, photooxidation, not evaporation or biodegradation, was the main factor responsible for oxidizing these aromatic steranes. However, biomarkers of BSs, ADs and DAs were mostly lost through evaporation. Therefore, aromatic steranes have the potential to be utilized to evaluate the photolytic behavior of petroleum hydrocarbons, while BSs, ADs, and DAs should not be used for this purpose.

A tool for modeling the winter oxygen depletion rate in arctic lakes	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Many arctic lakes freeze completely in winter. The few that retain unfrozen water for the entire winter period serve as overwintering fish habitat. In addition to serving as fish habitat, water in arctic lakes is needed for industrial and domestic use. Permits for water extraction seek to maximize water use without impacting dissolved oxygen (DO) levels and endangering fish habitat. The relationship between lake volume, winter DO budget, and extraction of water through pumping has historically not been well understood. A management model that could estimate end-of-winter DO would improve our understanding of the potential impacts of different management strategies. Using under-ice DO measurements (November to April) taken from two natural lakes and one flooded gravel mine on the North Slope of Alaska, a physically based model was developed to predict end-of-winter DO concentration, water-column DO profiles, and winter oxygen depletion rate in arctic lakes during periods of ice cover. Comparisons between the measured and model-predicted oxygen profiles in the three study lakes suggest that the depth-based DO modeling tool presented herein can be used to adequately predict the amount of DO available in arctic lakes throughout winter.																			1093-474X	1752-1688				APR	2008	44	2					293	304		10.1111/j.1752-1688.2007.00162.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2007.00162.x													WOS:000254741500004

(four age groups, initial weight range 29-373 g) were studied in three small Finnish lakes in 1991-1996. The average growth rate and visceral lipid content were significantly greater in lakes and years when the trout fed mainly on small fish, such as vendace (Coregonus albula L.), ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius L.) and one-summer-old perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) than their insectivorous conspecifics. The stocked trout initially foraging unpreferred food items shifted rapidly to feed on small fish when their stocks became abundant. Piscivorous trout increased their visceral lipids prior to winter whereas in insectivorous fish these decreased gradually during the growth season which probably caused increased overwinter mortality. Therefore, relative yields were significantly higher for piscivorous than insectivorous trout. On the other hand, the largest trout at release showed the poorest performance irrespective of the quality of the foraging environment.																			0003-455X	1797-2450					1999	36	2					103	120																WOS:000081258200005

Its water is characterised by a low content of mineral salts, rather low pH, and oligotrophic status, which are all currently viewed as being favorable for Chrysophyte growth and proliferation. The study of the phytoplankton at different depths of the water column for three years showed that Chrysophytes were one of the groups of algae less well-represented in the phytoplankton (1% and 8% respectively, for numbers of cells and biovolume). Ochromonas, Pseudopedinella, Mallomonas and Dinobryon were the more representative chrysophyte genera. D. cylindricum, D. divergens and D. crenulatum were some of the Dinobryon species observed. M. akrokomos, M. crassisquama and M. costata were among the most frequent Mallomonas species. Observations on the Chrysophyte cysts from samples of the lake sediment suggest that variability of representation is higher than in planktonic samples. The maximum values of Chrysophyte biovolume were found in the nutrient-exhausted epilimnion of summer and autumn which could be related to the mixotrophic capabilities of several species.

J	Plumb, JM				Plumb, John M.			A bioenergetics evaluation of temperature-dependent selection for the spawning phenology by Snake River fall Chinook salmon	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												High water temperatures can increase the energetic cost for salmon to migrate and spawn, which can be important for Snake River fall-run Chinook salmon because they migrate great distances (>500km) at a time when river temperatures (18-24 degrees C) can be above their optimum temperatures (16.5 degrees C). Average river temperatures and random combinations of migration and spawning dates were used to simulate fish travel times and determine the energetic consequences of different thermal experiences during migration. An energy threshold criterion (4kJ/g) was also imposed on survival and spawning success, which was used to determine how prevailing temperatures might select against certain migration dates and thermal experiences, and in turn, explain the selection for the current spawning phenology of the population. Scenarios of tributary use for thermal refugia under increasing water temperatures (1, 2, and 3 degrees C) were also run to determine which combinations of migration dates, travel rates, and resulting thermal experiences might be most affected by energy exhaustion. As expected, when compared to observations, the model under existing conditions and energy use could explain the onset, but not the end of the observed spawning migration. Simulations of early migrants had greater energy loss than late migrants regardless of the river temperature scenario, but higher temperatures disproportionately selected against a larger fraction of early-migrating fish, although using cold-water tributaries during migration provided a buffer against higher energy use at higher temperatures. The fraction of simulated fish that exceeded the threshold for migration success increased from 58% to 72% as average seasonal river temperatures over baseline temperatures increased. The model supports the conclusion that increases in average seasonal river temperatures as little as 1 degrees C could impose greater thermal constraints on the fish, select against early migrants, and in turn, truncate the onset of the current spawning migration.

This study aims to thoroughly explore the temporal characteristics of waterfront vibrancy and explore people's behavioral preferences for various types of waterfronts at various times. On the basis of social media data, this study uses the seasonal index analysis method to classify waterfronts. Then, the kernel density estimation was used to analyze the spatial structure of different types of waterfronts. Finally, temporally weighted regression was used to indicate people's preferences for various types of waterfronts. In general, results show the different temporal characteristics of users in waterfronts at different times and their behavioral preferences for waterfronts as the reasons behind these preface characteristics. First, on weekdays, people tend to visit daily waterfronts close to residences, and people find it convenient to walk after 18:00 and engage in recreational activities dominated by consumption and exercise, which reach a peak at 22:00-24:00. Second, on weekends, people prefer the weekend waterfronts with complete entertainment facilities and cultural themes. The natural seasonal waterfronts with seasonal landscapes attract people in various seasons, such as spring and autumn, whereas the social seasonal waterfront may be more attractive during high seasons, especially in March and June, due to big water events or nearby colleges and universities. Therefore, the government should improve the facilities of various types of waterfronts to satisfy people's preferences at different times and help in proposing targeted suggestions with reference to future city waterfront planning and space design, contributing to the waterfronts' vitality improvement, urban features, and promotion of urban sustainable development.																				2071-1050				NOV	2019	11	22							6308	10.3390/su11226308	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11226308													WOS:000503277900121

IMPACTS OF FRESHWATER MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES ON EASTERN OYSTER (CRASSOSTREA VIRGINICA) DENSITY AND RECRUITMENT: RECOVERY AND LONG-TERM STABILITY IN SEVEN FLORIDA ESTUARIES	JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH												Eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin 1791), were sampled from seven Florida estuaries from January 2005 through December 2007 as part of the prerestoration monitoring and assessment component of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. Study locations included Tampa Bay, Mosquito Lagoon, Sebastian River, St. Lucie estuary (3 study sites), Loxahatchee River (2 study sites), Lake Worth Lagoon, and Biscayne Bay. Settled oyster density was monitored twice per year at stations within each study site. Oyster recruitment, water temperature, and salinity were monitored on a monthly basis. Salinity varied greatly among the estuaries, and each study site fell into 1 of 2 primary salinity regimes: one relatively stable and with higher salinities (mean range, 24-35), and the other more variable and with lower salinities (mean range, 12-17). All 7 estuaries were impacted, to varying degrees, by the relatively active 2005 tropical storm season as well as local water management practices during the study. Two of the estuaries, St. Lucie and the Sebastian River, were severely impacted by controlled introductions of freshwater, which decreased salinities below the range that oysters can tolerate. As a result, live oysters were virtually absent from the study sites in both estuaries in 2005, when the freshwater introductions were most pronounced. At the opposite extreme, long-term reduction of freshwater flow into Biscayne Bay has exacerbated already increasing salinities and has resulted in the absence of reef-building oysters at that study site. Oysters were present at all other study sites, but densities were lower in 2005 than in subsequent years because of substantial salinity decreases after tropical storms in 2004 and 2005. The greatest and most stable oyster densities were found in Tampa Bay, where mean oyster density reached 400/m(2) by fall 2007. Recruitment was observed at each site on recruitment arrays retrieved from April through December, although the timing, duration, and intensity of the recruitment season varied annually and among study sites. The Tampa Bay, Mosquito Lagoon, Loxahatchee River, and Lake Worth Lagoon sites exhibited a bimodal recruitment pattern with peaks in the spring and fall. At the remaining sites, which were the most strongly affected by water management practices, recruitment patterns were sporadic and inconsistent throughout the study. The lowest recruitment rates occurred in 2005, when the density of settled oysters was also low, presumably because of reduced salinities resulting from a combination of active tropical storm seasons and controlled freshwater introductions.

J	Valk, H				Valk, Heiki			Sacred waters: the River Vohandu, Spring Puhalate and sacrificial lake near Otepaa	AJALOOLINE AJAKIRI-THE ESTONIAN HISTORICAL JOURNAL												The river Vohandu in south-eastern Estonia has become famous through the book Kurtzer Bericht und Unterricht Von der Falsch-heilig genandten Bache in Lieffland Wohhanda, written by Johann Gutslaff, the pastor of Urvaste parish (1644). The book mediates information about the events of 1642 when peasants of the riverside areas destroyed the new water mill of Somerpalu manor. This act took place because the river was considered to be sacred by the locals, and hindering of the water flow was thought to be the reason for the long-lasting bad weather. News of the water mill on the sacred river spread quickly over all Livonia: from Riga to Narva, Parnu and Reval, and also among the Latvian-speaking population. Gutslaff mentions two assemblies of peasants at Osula water mill (Fig. 1): on May 1 (when people gathered from manor areas on the upper course of the river) and July 8 (when those from the lower course gathered, including from Russia, i.e. from present-day Setomaa). Evidently, the hinterlands reflect communication areas and communication traditions of ancient and probably prehistoric origin. The article presents historical and folkloric information about the beginning of the sacred Vohandu River, discussing also the regions impacted by and reasons for its sacredness. The spring visited and described by Gutslaff one month after the events in Osula can be identified as the spring called Puhalate (sacred spring), which is reflected in folkloric data and still remembered by the older locals. The place is located in the historical Kolju village, ca 10 km south of Otepaa (Figs. 2, 3). The first folklore note about its sacredness and ability to change the weather comes from 1866. Although the spring was buried under gravel during road re-construction work in 1983, its approximate location (Fig. 5) was identified in 2014 by the finding of four votive coins from between 1574 and 1707 (Fig. 6). According to Gutslaff, the spring was located in a sacred grove, and keeping its waters clean was important for having good weather. It was not allowed to cut trees or break branches in the grove, and misbehaviour could cause diseases or even death. The sacredness of the spring and its ability to change the weather is also reflected in folkloric data. Toponyms in the surroundings of the spring give evidence of a large sacral area (Figs. 3, 4), and lore mentions popular assemblies in the grove at the sprint which continued until mid-1890s. Votive coins were brought to the sprint until the 1940s, and the water was used for healing. The custom to stop a funeral procession that was passing by the spring and to sprinkle some of its holy water on the coffin a unique practise in Estonia survived until the 1950s/60s. The concept of sacredness is bound, according to Gutslaff, with all the lakes which Vohandu ran through. The first lake on the path of the sacred river, called Lake Ilmjarv (weather lake) by Gutslaff, can be identified as present-day Lake Kauru (Figs. 7, 8). Most likely, this lake is identical to the lake 10 miles from Otepaa that was mentioned by the Popes legate Antonio Possevino in 1585 as a site of infant sacrifices, practiced to avoid thunder and bad weather. The sacrificing of children and cattle in some lakes infected by evil spirits to reconcile them was also mentioned in the annual report of the Jesuites in 1583. These memories of infant sacrifice are probably reflected in a popular type of legend which tells about a deal with a supernatural creature living in a lake or a pond: the person who wants to get a treasure must offer a child to him (but gives a cat in a bag instead). The Jesuites notes about sacrifices to the lakes also fit well with Gutslaffs notes about infant sacrifices (in the past) and oxes (in his time) to the sacred Vohandu River. The origins of the sacredness of Puhalate spring might be hidden in the geographical conditions of the region. The Vohandu River, which was considered sacred as a whole, begins in the watershed which separates its basin from the basin of Vaike-Emajogi River. Here the close connections and common origin of the words sacred and border appear. To the same watershed belong also Lake Kauru/Ilmjarv (located 600 m east of the spring), and three ponds which can predict the weather at the Konnu (Paina) farmstead (1.2 km north-east of the spring). There the water level in spring time was believed to indicate the weather of the forthcoming summer. The name Ilmjarv refers both to the weather and being the uppermost lake in the basin of a river. The sacredness of the watershed may also include Lake Puhajarv (sacred lake) this is the first lake on the path of Vaike-Emajogi River, which was also called Puhajogi (sacred river) on its upper course. The sacral complex of Vohandu River is unique in Estonia. Lore about the site, although almost forgotten in the present time, gives evidence of the continuity of beliefs and religious practices from the early seventeenth to the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

Zooplankton, as primary consumers, are sensitive and responsive to changes in the water environment. Water and zooplankton samples were collected on-site at Shanxi Reservoir quarterly to determine 12 water environmental indicators and to quantify the abundance of zooplankton of Cladocera, Copepoda and Rotifera by using the ZooScan zooplankton image-scanning analysis system, combined with OLYMPUS BX51 using machine learning recognition classification. The aim was to explore the relationship between water environmental factors and zooplankton through their spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Through principal component analysis, redundancy analysis and cluster analysis, variations in the factors driving zooplankton population growth in different seasons could be identified. At the same time, different taxa of zooplankton can form clusters with related water environmental factors during the abundant water period in summer and the dry water period in winter. Based on long-term monitoring, zooplankton can be used as a comprehensive indicator for water environment and water ecological health evaluation, as well as providing scientific support for regional water resources deployment and management.					; Xu, Ke-Jun/AAZ-5194-2020; 徐, 栋/GQY-5626-2022; Yin, Jingyun/HGU-6936-2022	cai, wang wei/0000-0001-7779-5380; Yin, Jingyun/0000-0002-7485-3714														2071-1050				NOV	2022	14	21							13719	10.3390/su142113719	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su142113719													WOS:000882275100001

Ammonium recycling supports toxic Planktothrix blooms in Sandusky Bay, Lake Erie: Evidence from stable isotope and metatranscriptome data	HARMFUL ALGAE												Sandusky Bay, Lake Erie, receives high nutrient loadings (nitrogen and phosphorus) from the Sandusky River, which drains an agricultural watershed. Eutrophication and cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) persist throughout summer. Planktothrix agardhii is the dominant bloom-forming species and the main producer of microcystins in Sandusky Bay. Non-N-2 fixing cyanobacteria, such as Planktothrix and Microcystis, thrive on chemically reduced forms of nitrogen, such as ammonium (NH4+) and urea. Ammonium regeneration and potential uptake rates and total microbial community demand for NH4+ were quantified in Sandusky Bay. Potential NH4+ uptake rates in the light increased from June to August at all stations. Dark uptake rates also increased seasonally and, by the end of August, were on par with light uptake rates. Regeneration rates followed a similar pattern and were significantly higher in August than June. Ammonium uptake kinetics during a Planktothrix-dominated bloom in Sandusky Bay and a Microcystis-dominated bloom in Maumee Bay were also compared. The highest half saturation constant (K-m) in Sandusky Bay was measured in June and decreased throughout the season. In contrast, K-m values in Maumee Bay were lowest at the beginning of summer and increased in October. A significant increase in V-max in Sandusky Bay was observed between July and the end of August, reflective of intense competition for depleted NH4+. Metatranscriptome results from Sandusky Bay show a shift from cyanophycin synthetase (luxury NH4+ uptake; cphA1) expression in early summer to cyanophycinase (intracellular N mobilization; cphB/cphA2) expression in August, supporting the interpretation that the microbial community is nitrogen-starved in late summer. Combined, our results show that, in late summer, when nitrogen concentrations are low, cyanoHABs in Sandusky Bay rely on regenerated NH4+ to support growth and toxin production. Increased dark NH4+ uptake late in summer suggests an important heterotrophic contribution to NH4+ depletion in the phycosphere. Kinetic experiments in the two bays suggest a competitive advantage for Planktothrix over Microcystis in Sandusky Bay due to its higher affinity for NH4+ at low concentrations.

Regional modeling of surface-atmosphere interactions and their impact on Great Lakes hydroclimate	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Land and water surfaces play a critical role in hydroclimate by supplying moisture to the atmosphere, yet the ability of climate models to capture their feedbacks with the atmosphere relative to large-scale transport is uncertain. To assess these land-lake-atmosphere feedbacks, we compare the controls on atmospheric moisture simulated by a regional climate model (RegCM) with observations and reanalysis products for the Great Lakes region. Three 23 year simulations, driven by one reanalysis product and two general circulation models, are performed. RegCM simulates wetter winters and drier summers than observed by up to 31 and 21%, respectively. Moisture advection exhibits similar biases, suggesting the contribution of external sources. Land surface fluxes account for nearly one third of summer precipitation according to two reanalysis products. RegCM underestimates reanalysis evapotranspiration by nearly 50%; however, the reanalyses overestimate measurements at three FLUXNET sites by up to a factor of 2, which may explain the model-reanalysis differences. Neither RegCM nor the reanalyses capture the spatial variability in land evapotranspiration observed across the three FLUXNET sites, indicating a source of model uncertainty. In addition, RegCM underestimates the observed evapotranspiration response to its atmospheric drivers such as vapor pressure deficit and temperature. Over the lakes, one model member overestimates convective precipitation caused by enhanced evaporation under warm lake surface temperatures, highlighting the need for accurate representation of lake temperature in the surface boundary condition. We conclude that climate models, including those driving reanalyses, underestimate the observed surface-atmosphere feedbacks and their influence on regional hydroclimate.

The obtained results seem to indicate that more favorable conditions for the development of the analyzed microorganisms prevailed in the studied tributaries of the Narew. A total of 36 species of fungi and fungus-like organisms were identified in these tributaries in spring and 35 in autumn, while respectively 32 and 26 species in the lotic oxbow lakes. Six taxa not identified in the oxbow lakes were found only in the tributaries of the river. They were: Alternaria alternata, Allomyces moniliformis, Catenaria anguillulae, Leptomitus lacteus, Rhipidium parthenosporum and Saprolegnia diclina. On the other hand, only two species occurred only in the oxbow lakes (not recorded in tributaries) (i. e. Catenophlyctis variabilis and Rhizophlyctis rosea). The differences observed in the microfungi species composition in the studied ecosystems are associated, among others, with the time of the year and physicochemical properties of the water. Hydrochemical parameters such as temperature, pH, Mg, N-NH3, N-NO3, P-PO4 and suspended solids showed positive correlation, and sulfates, chlorides, Ca, Fe correlated negatively with the number of taxa observed.

Metabolic activity of heterotrophic microbial communities of floodplain lakes in the middle reaches of the Ob River	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA												This study provides an opportunity to quantify the biogenic component of the carbon balance, its dynamics and relationship with environmental factors. This study is the first to evaluate the functioning of microbial communities in floodplain lakes in the middle reaches of the Ob River from the perspective of studying their metabolic activity in the context of seasonal and spatial environmental changes. The purpose of this work was to assess seasonal changes in the metabolic spectra of bacterial communities in water bodies of the Middle Ob floodplain. During the summer low water period (September 2023), winter low water period (snow period, March 2024) and spring flood (May 2024), functional diversity and quantitative microbiological characteristics of heterotrophic microbial communities in the surface and bottom layers of the water column of three floodplain lakes located in the vicinity of the TSU research station "Kaibasovo" (N 57.24569342272839, E 84.18459154598635), as well as the water of the Ob River itself, were studied. Functional diversity was determined using the multisubstrate testing method on 96-well Biolog Ecoplate test systems (USA) with calculation of the AWCD (average well-covered development) index. The TMC (total microbial count), obtained by direct counting of bacterial cells in a fluorescent-stained sample, was used as a quantitative characteristic. According to the nonparametric analysis of variance (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA test, Median test), AWCD and TMC did not differ between lakes (p>0.05). Seasonal changes were revealed for AWCD and TMC (see Fig. 1). AWCD correlated (Spearman rank correlations were used, p < 0.05) with the consumption of amino acids (0.52), carbohydrates (0.54), amines (0.50) and oxycarboxylic acids (0.62), TMC correlated with the consumption of carbohydrates (0.45) and polymers (0.63). The dynamics of AWCD were similar for the surface layer of all lakes, and did not show obvious patterns in the bottom layer. Throughout the year, higher TMC values were observed in the bottom layer, although this pattern was not observed for AWCD (see Fig. 1). This is due to the effect of ultraviolet radiation from the sun and the influence of allochthonous microflora on the current AWCD values. TMC in floodplain lakes increased during winter low water and had minimum values during the flood period. During the winter low water period, the AWCD and the consumption of most substrate groups are higher in the bottom layer. Seasonal differences in consumption of carboxylic acid phosphates (Kruskal-Wallis test: H (2, N = 18) = 10.36; p = 0.01; Median test: Chi-Square = 12.00; df = 2; p = 0.00) and polymers (Kruskal-Wallis test: H (2, N = 18) =7.18; p = 0.03; Median test: Chi-Square = 9.33; df = 2; p = 0.01) have been identified (see Fig. 2). A large number of correlations between the consumption of different groups of substrates, including within the surface and bottom layers, indicate the cosmopolitan nature and functional interchangeability of representatives of microbial communities. Moreover, during low water, when conditions are most favorable for the growth of microflora, the number of correlations was maximum (9 out of 15); during the freeze-up period it decreased significantly (4 out of 15), which may indicate a targeted growth of more specialized microflora. In May, the number of correlations increased again (5 out of 15). Seasonal changes in the functional and quantitative characteristics of microbial communities did not correspond to each other-the increase in the number of microorganisms did not cause an increase in functional diversity. The microflora suppression during flooding characterizes the demi-seasonal succession of the microbial community. Based on the data obtained, one can judge the functional cosmopolitanism and functional interchangeability of representatives of microbial communities of floodplain water bodies.

The relative importance of cisco (Coregonus artedi) in the diets of common loons (Gavia immer) among a set of cisco refuge lakes in Minnesota	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Common loon (Gavia immer (Brunnich, 1764)) foraging patterns and the relative importance of cisco (Coregonus artedi Lesueur, 1818) in the diets of loons were evaluated for the Whitefish Chain of Lakes, a set of coldwater cisco refuge lakes in Minnesota, USA. Environmental DNA metabarcoding of loon fecal samples detected 15 fish species. Yellow perch (Perca flavescens (Mitchill, 1814)), mimic shiner (Notropis volucellus (Cope, 1865)), and cisco were the most prominent prey detected across the study lakes. We observed a shift in fish species consumed, with increases in detections of mimic shiner and cisco DNA among loon fecal samples collected in August and September. In some locations, suitable oxythermal habitat became restricted throughout the summer, forcing cisco into surface waters, which potentially increased their vulnerability to loon predation. Conversely, large foraging aggregations of loons were observed during late summer through fall at locations with ample oxythermal habitat and abundant cisco populations. We hypothesize that cisco were sought by loons as a high-calorie prey resource prior to migration. Conservation efforts directed at preserving water quality in important cisco refuge lakes are likely to benefit common loons through enhancement of both the forage base, for resident and migrating birds, and breeding habitat suitability.

J	Ferguson, SH; Elkie, PC				Ferguson, SH; Elkie, PC			Use of lake areas in winter by woodland caribou	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												Understanding space-use patterns of highly mobile animals, such as woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou Gmelin), is required for ecosystem conservation. We consider the use of lakes in winter as important habitat for woodland caribou both to reduce predation risk and acquire food. To test scale differences relative to caribou use of ice-covered lakes in winter, we compare the use of ice-covered lakes within a regional study area and within sub-regional landscapes at two spatial levels: (1) seasonal selection of winter ranges and (2) daily locations. We used 100% minimum convex polygons with a 500-m buffer for winter ranges, and 500-m radius buffer around individual radio telemetry locations of 27 caribou from 1995 to 2000 as spatial measures of use of takes of various dimensions by caribou. In the winter-range analysis, caribou used areas with more lakes in the 5-100-ha size class, including lakes with more perimeter, larger area, and higher fractal dimensions as compared with the relative distribution of available lakes. These patterns were confirmed at the regional level (Manitoba border in the west to the Hudson Bay lowlands to the east) and at the sub-regional level. At the finest level of resolution of daily locations, caribou selected lakes with greater area and perimeter in the west but not in the east. Our findings should be considered when developing local plans for forest management and designing landscapes where the conservation of woodland caribou is a goal.																			1092-6194						2005	12	1					45	66		10.1656/1092-6194(2005)012[0045:UOLAIW]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/1092-6194(2005)012[0045:UOLAIW]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000228492500005

Abiotic and Landscape Factors Constrain Restoration Outcomes Across Spatial Scales of a Widespread Invasive Plant	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												The natural recolonization of native plant communities following invasive species management is notoriously challenging to predict, since outcomes can be contingent on a variety of factors including management decisions, abiotic factors, and landscape setting. The spatial scale at which the treatment is applied can also impact management outcomes, potentially influencing plant assembly processes and treatment success. Understanding the relative importance of each of these factors for plant community assembly can help managers prioritize patches where specific treatments are likely to be most successful. Here, using effects size analyses, we evaluate plant community responses following four invasive Phragmites australis management treatments (1: fall glyphosate herbicide spray, 2: summer glyphosate herbicide spray, 3: summer imazapyr herbicide spray, 4: untreated control) applied at two patch scales (12,000 m(2) and 1,000 m(2)) and monitored for 5 years. Using variation partitioning, we then evaluated the independent and shared influence of patch scale, treatment type, abiotic factors, and landscape factors on plant community outcomes following herbicide treatments. We found that Phragmites reinvaded more quickly in large patches, particularly following summer herbicide treatments, while native plant cover and richness increased at a greater magnitude in small patches than large. Patch scale, in combination with abiotic and landscape factors, was the most important driver for most plant responses. Compared with the small plots, large patches commonly had deeper and more prolonged flooding, and were in areas with greater hydrologic disturbance in the landscape, factors associated with reduced native plant recruitment and greater Phragmites cover. Small patches were associated with less flooding and landscape disturbance, and more native plants in the surrounding landscape than large patches, factors which promoted higher native plant conservation values and greater native plant cover and richness. Herbicide type and timing accounted for very little of the variation in native plant recovery, emphasizing the greater importance of patch selection for better management outcomes. To maximize the success of treatment programs, practitioners should first manage Phragmites patches adjacent to native plant species and in areas with minimal hydrologic disturbance.					; Kettenring, Karin/A-5829-2011	Kettenring, Karin/0000-0001-7080-0407; 													1664-462X					APR 18	2019	10								481	10.3389/fpls.2019.00481	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2019.00481								31110510					WOS:000464922600002

Experimental results indicate that the average As concentration in TSP and dry deposition was highest in Quan-xing (industrial) and lowest in Gao-mei (wetland). The mean As composition in TSP was highest in Hei-mei (residential) and lowest in Gao-mei (wetland). The average highest arsenic (As) of seasonal concentrations and compositions in TSP, dry deposition were occurred in winter and fall denotes that fossil fuel combustion by Taichung thermal power plant (TTPP) emissions and heating by household were the main reasons responsible for the high data values measured. Atmospheric concentrations of arsenic (As) were analyzed by a ICP-MS (Perkin Elmer Sciex ELAN DRC II). Finally, best-fit model can be used successfully in the prediction of ambient air pollutants around suburban/coastal, downtown, residential, industrial and wetland areas.

Lake Vrana is the largest surface freshwater resource in mid-Dalmatia, while the local springs are heavily used in agriculture. The karstified carbonate ridge that separates this shallow lake from the Adriatic Sea enables seawater intrusion if the lakes' precipitation-evaporation balance is disturbed. In this study, the impact of anthropogenic activities and drought exuberated salinization on microbial communities was tracked in Lake Vrana and its inlets, using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The lack of precipitation and high water temperatures in summer months introduced an imbalance in the water regime of the lake, allowing for seawater intrusion, mainly via the karst conduit Jugovir. The determined microbial community spatial differences in the lake itself and the main drainage canals were driven by salinity, drought, and nutrient loading. Particle-associated and free-living microorganisms both strongly responded to the ecosystem perturbations, and their co-occurrence was driven by the salinization event. Notably, a bloomof halotolerant taxa, predominant the sulfur-oxidizing genus Sulfurovum, emerged with increased salinity and sulfate concentrations, having the potential to be used as an indicator for salinization of shallow coastal lakes. Following summer salinization, lake water column homogenization took from a couple of weeks up to a few months, while the entire system displayed increased salinity despite increased precipitation. This study represents a valuable contribution to understanding the impact of the Freshwater Salinization Syndrome on Mediterranean lakes' microbial communities and the ecosystem resilience.

J	VERDUIN, J				VERDUIN, J			PRIMARY PRODUCTION IN LAKES	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The mean photosynthetic rate of lake phytoplankton under optimal light (natural conditions) is about 0.5 micromoles of O2 evolved or CO2 consumed per microliter of organisms per hour; 1-2 micromoles per milligram ash-free dry weight per hour; and 0.2 micromoles per microgram of chlorophyll per hour. Simple equations are presented for computing photosynthetic yield per square meter of water surface. Computations for several lakes yielded values mostly lying between 150-200 millimoles per square meter per day. A year-round study under completely natural conditions in western Lake Erie showed winter yields of about 40 millimoles per square meter per day and summer maxima of about 300. The annual curve followed the solar radiation curve closely. It is estimated that 28 days are required for a gram of phytoplankton (ash-free dry weight) to produce an additional gram of glucose available for reproduction; 80 per cent of the photo-synthate produced is required to support phytoplankton respiration.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1956	1	2					85	91		10.4319/lo.1956.1.2.0085	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1956.1.2.0085													WOS:A1956WY35500003
J	Mattson, MD				Mattson, Mark D.			Managing phosphorus loads from agricultural cranberry bogs to restore White Island Pond	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												The historical increase in phosphorus fertilizer application on commercial cranberry bogs from similar to 1960 to 2008 is associated with the decline in water quality of White Island Pond, Plymouth/Wareham, Massachusetts. A total maximum daily load (TMDL) and a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with cooperating groups required specific cranberry bog management practices to restore the lake. We used a cooperative approach among the University of Massachusetts, the growers, and the town with the assistance of a series of US Environmental Protection Agency 319 Program grants focusing on reduced fertilizer rates, discharge diversions, and an aluminum treatment of the lake to address the excess phosphorus inputs. In the East Basin of the pond, where total phosphorus (TP) summer concentrations previously averaged 82 mu g/L, the concentrations dropped 41% over 4 years to 48 mu g/L after fertilizer reductions and diversions of bog discharge floodwaters occurred at the cranberry bogs. After this source of phosphorus was controlled, an aluminum treatment was applied to East Basin in 2013 and to both basins in 2014. Subsequently, TP concentrations fell an additional 44% (85% total) in East Basin to a concentration of 12 mu g/L in 2014. Summer average TP concentrations across the basins were 13 mu g/L and met the TMDL target of 19 mu g/L. The transparency has been restored, and the frequent cyanobacteria blooms have been eliminated. The new management guidance for bogs in the TMDL appendix offers a cooperative path toward restoration of lakes and streams while maintaining cranberry yields.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2015	31	4					281	291		10.1080/10402381.2015.1079754	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2015.1079754													WOS:000365866900001

Population dynamics and spatial distribution of monogeneans on the gills of Oreochromis mossambicus (Peters, 1852) from two lakes of the Limpopo River System, South Africa	JOURNAL OF HELMINTHOLOGY												An investigation was conducted into the parasitic infection of an indigenous cichlid, Oreochromis mossambicus, collected seasonally from the Nwanedi-Luphephe dams of the Limpopo River System from July 2007 to April 2009. Of 157 host specimens examined, 115 (73.25%) were infected by at least one gill parasite. In all, 1565 monogenean specimens were collected, belonging to five different species and two genera: Cichlidogyrus (C. halli, C. sclerosus, C. tilapiae and C. dossoui) and Scutogyrus (S. longicornis). Infracommunities were poor, with only 27 (17.20%) hosts harbouring four of the five species observed. Cichlidogyrus halli was the dominant species, with a prevalence of 73.25%. Prevalence values for each of the other four species were less than 50%. The mean intensities for each of the five species were low (< 8 parasites/host). The parasite abundance and intensity levels were not influenced by either the sex or the size of the host. The abundance of all parasite species except for S. longicornis exhibited seasonal fluctuations, reaching peaks in winter and summer. The spatial distribution of each parasite was studied on different regions of the gill, and positive associations among some species were revealed.																			0022-149X	1475-2697				JUN	2011	85	2					146	152		10.1017/S0022149X10000301	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022149X10000301								20663243					WOS:000290155900006

Freshwater mussels have a life history that greatly influences their geographical distribution, genetic structure, and demographic characteristics. Here, we describe and compare the spatial genetic structure and diversity of 5 freshwater mussel species with different brooding periods and uses of larval parasitism. These 5 species co-occur in tributaries in Poyang Lake in south central China, and we studied their populations in the Gan and Fuhe Rivers, which are both large tributaries of Poyang Lake. Cytochrome c oxidase subunit-I (COI) haplotype richness and diversity of species with a spring or summer glochidia brooding period (Lamprotula caveata,Nodularia douglasiae, andSolenaia oleivora) were greater than richness and diversity in species with a winter brooding period (Anemina arcaeformis,S. carinata). In addition, the COI haplotype richness and diversity ofA. arcaeformis, which does not have a parasitic portion of its life cycle, was lower than 3 species that require a host fish to complete their life cycles (L. caveata,N. douglasiae, andS. oleivora) and was higher thanS. carinata. We also used the COI sequences and microsatellite datasets to determine whether the populations of each of the 5 species in the Gan and Fuhe Rivers are admixed or genetically distinct. Genetic differentiation was evident among collection populations ofL. caveata,N. douglasiae, andS. carinataand largely absent inA. arcaeformisandS. oleivora. We conclude that differences in genetic diversity and patterns of genetic structure in these sympatric species could result from the different life-history attributes of these species, particularly timing and length of the brooding period, nonparasitic vs parasitic life cycles, and different host fish requirements. Therefore, we suggest increased emphasis on life history and reproductive biology research and urge managers to consider that these traits differ among freshwater mussels when making management decisions for the conservation of genetic and species diversity.

However, the information on their concentration in the real aquatic environment is still limited, hindering the rational evaluation of their potential hazards. In this study, water samples from Taihu Lake were collected in June and November 2023, to investigate the spatial distribution and temporal variations of TiO2NPs. 2 NPs. Using phosphorylated Fe3O4 3 O 4 particles based magnetic solid phase extraction and ICP-MS determination, high concentrations of TiO2NPs 2 NPs were detected in the western and northern regions of Taihu Lake. These areas contribute to 83 % of the total runoff into the lake. Total Ti levels were typically higher in November than in June, but no marked seasonal difference was observed for TiO2NPs. 2 NPs. Different shapes of TiO2NPs 2 NPs with both smooth and rough surfaces were observed in the surface water. To further distinguish whether these TiO2NPs 2 NPs were sourced from the natural background or anthropogenic sources, the ratios of Ti to other rare elements including Nb were calculated. In November, the Ti/Nb ratios at most sampling sites were significantly higher than those in June, indicating that a large amount of engineered TiO2NPs 2 NPs are discharged into Taihu Lake during the summer and autumn seasons. Our study contributes to the understanding of contamination levels, spatial distribution, and temporal variation of TiO2NPs 2 NPs in lake systems, and provides valuable data for their further risk assessment.

Eli; Kann, Jacob			Spatial and temporal variability of river periphyton below a hypereutrophic lake and a series of dams	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Klamath River is described as an "upside-down" river due to its origins from the hypereutrophic Upper Klamath Lake (UKL) and hydrology that is heavily regulated by upstream dams. Understanding the lake and reservoir effects on benthic communities in the river can inform important aspects of its water quality dynamics. Periphyton samples were collected in May-November from 2004, 2006-2013 at nine long-term monitoring sites along 306 river km below UKL and a series of dams (n = 299). Cluster analysis of periphyton assemblages identified three statistically different periphyton groups (denoted Groups 1-3). Group 1 occurred primarily in the upstream reach for June-October and had a higher percentage of sestonic species, including the cyanobacteria Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Microcystis aeruginosa, consistent with the presence of upstream reservoirs. Group 2 had the highest relative biomass of diatoms and lowest relative biomass of cyanobacteria. Sites in the lower reach of the Klamath River fell into Group 2 in May-June and transitioning into Group 3 for July-October. Group 3 was dominated by nitrogen (N)-fixing species, including three diatoms (Epithemia sorex, Epithemia turgida, and Rhopalodia gibba) with cyanobacterial endosymbionts and the cyanobacterium Calothrix sp. Periphyton assemblages were strongly associated with temporal variations in flow conditions (e.g., decreasing flow from spring to fall) and spatial gradients in nutrient concentrations (e.g., decreasing from upstream to downstream). The inverse longitudinal relationship between periphyton biomass and nutrients may be explained by the ability of benthic N-fixers (Group 3) to overcome N limitation. Overall results showed a strong inverse relationship between the relative biomass of N-fixers and nitrogen concentrations and flow. This long-term dataset provides valuable insight into Klamath River's seasonal and longitudinal patterns of benthic algal communities and associated environmental variables. Our findings can inform river management decisions such as reducing upstream nutrient loads, setting flow regimes, and potential dam removals. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Microcystin in Missouri reservoirs	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												During summers (May-Aug) 2004-2006, 177 Missouri reservoirs were sampled monthly at open pelagic locations to assess regional patterns in microcystin concentration, frequency of occurrence over successive summer seasons and relations with environmental factors. Microcystin was detected in 58% of Missouri reservoirs and 23% of samples (n = 1402). Total microcystin concentrations, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ranged from <= 0.1 to 21 mu g/L. Concentrations >= 1 mu g/L were detected in 10% of reservoirs and exceeded the human health concern limit of 20 mu g/L once in a single sample. Microcystin occurred throughout summer, with maximum concentrations in individual reservoirs observed in each month. Occurrence was consistent across years, with about one-half of Missouri reservoirs having detectable microcystin each summer. Eleven reservoirs with microcystin maxima >= 1 mu g/L were sampled multiple seasons; of these, 8 had detectable microcystin each summer, which indicates that short-term surveys can identify water bodies with the greatest potential for toxin production. Eutrophic reservoirs in northern Missouri had the greatest microcystin occurrence and concentrations. Reservoirs with detectable microcystin had significantly (p < 0.01) greater nutrient and chlorophyll values and significantly shallower Secchi depths than reservoirs without detection. All correlations, however, had r-values <= 0.35, and bivariate plots indicated nonlinear trends. Cylindrospermopsin was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 36 reservoirs once in late summer 2006; 14% had small detectable levels (total concentrations <1 mu g/L). This is the first report of cylindrospermopsin in Missouri.

We combined a broad comparison of average total phosphorus (TP)-biomass relationships in LOW and other north temperate lakes with a detailed spatiotemporal analysis of net-, nanno-, and picoplankton, total bacterioplankton, nutrient status, and water quality across six hydrological sectors of the lake between 2008 and 2010. Average total phytoplankton biomass (TB) varied considerably among zones and years but, similar to TP, was highest in the shallower, more eutrophic southern zones with a generally lower than average TB/TP yield within the among-lakes dataset. Summer-fall blooms of N-2-fixing cyanobacteria were dominated by Aphanizomenon across most sectors except in the north, where Dolichospermum predominated. Unlike the larger size fractions, patterns in picoplankton suggested non-nutrient constraints: phycoerythrin-rich picocyanobacteria (<2 mu m) showed a distinct south-north increase correlated with water transparency, while the more abundant phycocyanin-rich fraction was related to dissolved organicmaterial with no distinct spatial patterns. Bacterial numbers were higher in surface layers and significantly related to temperature but not nutrients; spatial distribution indicated they were not directly introduced from riverine inputs. Overall, planktonic P deficiency was higher in the north and increased in late summer concurrent with N co-limitation and increases in N-2-fixers. The combined data suggest that P ultimately limits LOW plankton, but short-term N and Si deficiencies influence the plankton community composition.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	4					415	432		10.1080/10402381.2017.1331282	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2017.1331282													WOS:000423047200008

Traditionally, such observations are conducted in situ, but remote sensing offers a cost-effective and scalable alternative. Here, an algorithm for macrophyte detection using satellite data was created; we utilized clustering, with its results serving as target labels for building a machine-learning model. We developed a model for macrophyte identification using reflectance data in the near-infrared band during spring and summer. The derived algorithm, employing Sentinel-2 satellite reflectance data, enables the identification of open water, submerged and floating macrophytes and emergent macrophytes. This approach enhances the efficiency and applicability of macrophyte assessment, bridging the gap between field observations and remote sensing for comprehensive aquatic ecosystem monitoring.

Network of Interactions Between Ciliates and Phytoplankton During Spring	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												The annually recurrent spring phytoplankton blooms in freshwater lakes initiate pronounced successions of planktonic ciliate species. Although there is considerable knowledge on the taxonomic diversity of these ciliates, their species-specific interactions with other microorganisms are still not well understood. Here we present the succession patterns of 20 morphotypes of ciliates during spring in Lake Zurich, Switzerland, and we relate their abundances to phytoplankton genera, flagellates, heterotrophic bacteria, and abiotic parameters. Interspecific relationships were analyzed by contemporaneous correlations and time-lagged co-occurrence and visualized as association networks. The contemporaneous network pointed to the pivotal role of distinct ciliate species (e.g., Balanion planctonicum, Rimostrornbidium humile) as primary consumers of cryptomonads, revealed a clear overclustering of mixotrophic/omnivorous species, and highlighted the role of Halteria/Pelagohalteria as important bacterivores. By contrast, time-lagged statistical approaches (like local similarity analyses, LSA) proved to be inadequate for the evaluation of high-frequency sampling data. LSA led to a conspicuous inflation of significant associations, making it difficult to establish ecologically plausible interactions between ciliates and other microorganisms. Nevertheless, if adequate statistical procedures are selected, association networks can be powerful tools to formulate testable hypotheses about the autecology of only recently described ciliate species.					; Pomati, Francesco/G-2367-2010; Eckert, Ester/J-5989-2014; Pernthaler, Jakob/A-2257-2008	Posch, Thomas/0000-0001-5145-3761; Pernthaler, Jakob/0000-0001-7558-909X; Eckert, Ester/0000-0002-7314-1715; 													1664-302X					NOV 20	2015	6								1289	10.3389/fmicb.2015.01289	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2015.01289								26635757					WOS:000366017300001

Currently, mechanisms regulating eagle populations are not well understood. To examine potential regulating processes in the Pacific Northwest, where eagles are no longer primarily regulated by contaminants or direct persecution, we examined bald eagle reproductive success, breeding populations, winter populations, mortality, and salmon stream use. Wintering and breeding eagle populations in south-coastal British Columbia (BC) quadrupled between the early 1980s and the late 1990s, and have since stabilized. Density-dependent declines in reproduction occurred during 1986-2009, but not through changes in site quality. Mid-winter survival was crucial as most mortality occurred then, and models showed that density-dependent reductions in population growth rates were partially due to reduced survival. Wintering eagles in British Columbia fed heavily on chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) runs, and then switched to birds in late winter, when mortality was highest. Eagles tended to arrive after the peak in salmon availability at streams in BC as part of a migration associated with salmon streams from Alaska to northern Washington. Eagles were most abundant in southern BC during cold Alaskan winters and in years of high chum salmon availability. We suggest that eagle populations in the Pacific Northwest are currently partially limited by density on the breeding grounds and partially by adult mortality in late winter, likely due to reduced late winter salmon stocks forcing eagles to exploit more marginal prey supplies. Larger eagle populations have affected some local prey populations. (C) 2011 The Wildlife Society.

This study employs an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm to interpret wetland landscapes using the Gao-Fen Satellite Images across 14 different water levels. Methods such as Pearson correlation and linear fitting are used to analyze the effects of water level changes on the habitat of wintering wading birds, aiming to explore scientifically based optimum water level. The ultimate goal is to provide a scientific basis for determining the optimum water level regulation scheme for the proposed Poyang Lake Hydraulic Project. The results indicate that the area and shape of Poyang Lake's wetlands are highly plastic, with landscape heterogeneity decreasing and homogeneity increasing as water levels rise. The habitat area for wintering wading birds shows an inverted "V" shape variation with rising water levels, reaching a maximum of 1796.02 km2 at a water level of 9.86 m, which accounts for about 48.40 % of the study area. The water level changes in Poyang Lake significantly impact the landscape pattern of the wading bird habitats (p < 0.01).

A total of 13,892 individuals (mainly larvae and juveniles) representing 9 families and 22 species were collected monthly by small seine net (mesh size 1 mm) throughout the study period. The numbers of fish species and individuals increased from spring to early summer in each year, with the highest species and individual numbers in June. The most abundant species were the gobiid Rhinogobius sp. (47.1. of the total number of individuals collected during the study period), the centrarchid Lepomis macrochirus macrochirus (19.8.), the gobiid Tridentiger brevispinis (12.5.), the salangid Salangichthys microdon (8.4.), the gobiid Gymnogobius urotaenia (3.6.), the cyprinid Pseudorasbora parva (2.9.), the osmerid Hypomesus nipponensis (2.0.) and the hemiramphid Hyporhamphus intermedius (1.4.). Based on the occurrence patterns and developmental stages of fishes sampled, it is suggested that the reed stand was used as a place of temporary growth and residence by a variety of fishes.																			0021-5392	1349-998X					2015	81	6					964	972		10.2331/suisan.81.964	http://dx.doi.org/10.2331/suisan.81.964													WOS:000366175900003

One of the most significant Sources Of CO2 is the fossil fuel used for the generation of electric power required by the machinery used for services such as freezing, refrigeration, and air conditioning. If these services Could be generated by passive means or from natural sources, the amount of human-generated CO, could be reduced significantly. This reduction could be achieved by energy savings, by improved insulation, and by recovery of heat or cold. Beyond these measures it is possible to use alternative sources of cold. Such sources are air, rivers, lakes, or oceans from which cold can be extracted during winter; then stored during spring; for eventual use during summer. A number of alternative schemes have been devised. Some have foundered, some are still fighting for their existence, and some have been overwhelming successes. The fates of these schemes depend very much on local conditions, such as electricity prices, government policies, national CO, policy, national acceptance of the Kyoto agreements, etc. One of these schemes, which will be addressed in this paper, is the use of groundwater for cold storage and cooling. The paper will describe the basic technology, the theoretical and practical problems that have to be addressed for the successful implementation of the scheme, and the environmental aspects including the CO2 reduction. The presentation and discussion will be based on the experiences gained on the first 15 plants that are in operation in Denmark and the design of another 10 plants that are in the planning and pre-testing stages (involving several industrial companies). The paper will describe and discuss the technology, the effective economics, the economics relative to competing technologies, and the effective specific price of the achieved reduction of CO2. The global potential will be addressed (this lies chiefly in areas where there are significant seasonal temperature variations, such as regions with inland climate, at high elevations, or in temperate zones). Measures to overcome the obstacles to general acceptance and full exploitation of the economic, exergetic and environmental advantages will be proposed.																					968-489-027-3				2004							215	224																WOS:000232747300021

According to the operational taxonomic units (OTUs), diversity index, relative abundance, and redundancy analysis (RDA) of the bacteria, the results showed that (i) the bacterial diversity of the lake center area was lower than that of the macrophyte-dominated area, and it was higher in winter than that in summer as a whole; (ii) seasonal factors and geographical changes had obvious effects on the abundance of dominant bacteria, including Proteobacteria and Firmicutes; (iii) a large number of unclassified bacteria were detected in this study, and the dominant unclassified genera in both lake areas included unclassified Sva0485, unclassified Anaerolineaceae, and unclassified Nitrospiraceae; and (iv) TN and TOC were the main environmental factors influencing the sediment bacterial community in Lake Bosten, as determined by RDA analysis.

How does interannual trophic variability caused by vertical water mixing affect reproduction and population density of the Daphnia longispina group in Lake Iseo, a deep stratified lake in Italy?	INLAND WATERS												Lake Iseo is a deep meromictic lake located in Italy. During the past 20 years (1993-2013), the lake has experienced complete mixing of the water column only in spring 2005 and 2006. The full overturn episodes in these 2 years resulted in an increase in nutrients in both years, but an increase in phytoplankton biovolume occurred in the surface layers only in 2005. Our study examined if the magnitude of vertical mixing and the resulting increase in concentrations of epilimnetic total phosphorous (TP) can help predict reproduction and abundance of the main primary consumers, the cladocerans. We investigated the lake for 9 years (2001-2009) and compared annual changes in the Cladocera community and reproduction of the Daphnia longispina group between years of full and partial mixing. During the complete vertical mixing years (2005 and 2006), the taxonomical composition of Cladocera did not change, and density relationships among taxa shifted slightly toward an increase in the population density of Daphnia spp. Phytoplankton biovolume was significantly related to Daphnia mean clutch size. The increase in TP subsequent to the complete vertical mixing during late winter-early spring also seemed to predict reproduction and population density of Daphnia species. To our knowledge, this is the first long-term field study highlighting the importance of vertical mixing depth and TP concentrations on Daphnia abundance and phenology in a meromictic-oligomictic deep lake.					; Gulati, Ramesh/A-3155-2011; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012	LEONI, BARBARA/0000-0001-9448-9457; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X													2044-2041	2044-205X					2014	4	2					193	203		10.5268/IW-4.2.663	http://dx.doi.org/10.5268/IW-4.2.663													WOS:000335927100009

The present study evaluated the toxicity of a winter cyanobacterial bloom in a eutrophicated freshwater lake located in Western Poland. The bloom was dominated by potentially toxic species: Planktothrix agardhii, Limnothrix redekei, and Aphanizomenon gracile. The toxin analysis revealed the presence of demethylated forms of microcystin-RR and microcystin-LR in ranges of 24.6-28.7 and 6.6-7.6 A mu g/L, respectively. The toxicity of sampled water was further evaluated in platelet-rich plasma isolated from healthy human subjects using lipid peroxidation and lactate dehydrogenase assays. No significant adverse effects were observed. The present study demonstrates that toxicity of some winter cyanobacterial blooms in the temperate zone, like that in LubosiA"skie Lake, may not exhibit significant health risks despite microcystin production.					; Rzymski, Piotr/I-2240-2012; Wejnerowski, Łukasz/K-1886-2019; Meriluoto, Jussi/A-5309-2008	Wejnerowski, Lukasz/0000-0002-2690-4302; Rzymski, Piotr/0000-0002-4713-0801; Meriluoto, Jussi/0000-0002-6300-301X													0963-9292	1573-3017				AUG	2018	27	6					752	760		10.1007/s10646-018-1957-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-018-1957-x								29934736					WOS:000439474000011

Based on particle size distributions and microscope analysis of epilimnetic samples collected between June and October 1981 throughout Green Bay, at least two distinct regions can be identified. Lower bay waters are hypereutrophic and differ from all other regions throughout summer and fall. Upper bay regions are meso-oligotrophic and similar to Lake Michigan proper. These analyses demonstrate that the lower bay and upper bay regions undergo seasonal changes in epilimnetic algal communities similar to those which occur in separate lakes with differing trophic status. Recent reductions in nutrient loading to the lower bay region should produce a clear improvement in water quality, but the impact of colonization of the bay by zebra mussels is less clear given the abundance of filamentous and colonial phytoplankton in lower Green Bay.

The widespread application of sedimentary Group I LCAs, however, is hampered by an incomplete understanding of the environmental controls on the occurrence of Group I LCAs in freshwater lakes. The correspondence between Group I LCA concentrations and pH (6.2-8.5) in northern Alaskan freshwater lakes (Longo et al., 2016) suggests that Group I Isochrysidales may preferentially thrive in freshwater lakes with high pH. Here, we systematically study LCA distributions, haptophyte-specific 18S rDNA sequences, and concentrations of major ions and trace elements in 18 freshwater volcanic lakes in northeastern China with an extended pH range from 7.17 to 9.99. We find that 11 of the 18 lakes examined contain Group I LCAs and the corresponding DNA sequences of their producers. Our DNA results indicate that the dominant alkenone producer in all 11 lakes is closely related to the Group I Greenland OTU 5 genotype, with the exception of two anthropogenically impacted lakes where small numbers of Group II sequences are found. Statistical analyses indicate that the highest concentrations of Group I LCAs are found in oligotrophic freshwater lakes with pH ranging from similar to 7.3 to 8.8. We find that elevated concentrations of certain trace elements may lead to the disappearance of Group I LCAs despite lake water falling within the optimal pH range. Together with previously published Group I LCA data from the temperature calibration in Northern Hemisphere freshwater lakes (Longo et al., 2018), we find, for the first time, that Group I R3b (R3b = C-37:3b/(C38:3bEt + C-37:3b)) values are most sensitive to winter temperature changes when mean winter temperature is higher than similar to-20 degrees. Our results suggest that the freshwater volcanic lakes in northeastern China are highly valuable targets for paleotemperature reconstructions using Group I LCAs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

J	MCMANUS, J; COLLIER, RW; DYMOND, J				MCMANUS, J; COLLIER, RW; DYMOND, J			MIXING PROCESSES IN CRATER LAKE, OREGON	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Subsurface hydrothermal activity dominates the heat and salt budgets of the deep water column in Crater Lake, Oregon. From a time series of conductivity-temperature-depth data and data from a thermistor chain mooring, we estimate that the net hydrothermal heat flow is approximately 1 W m-2 and the corresponding salt flux is approximately 5 mug m-2 s-1. This paper discusses the observation of these fluxes and the mechanisms and time scales of mixing responsible for the redistribution of these properties through the water column. Free convection and wind mixing homogenize the upper 200 m of the like twice annually. Deep-lake ventilation occurs during early winter and to some extent during late spring. However, since the deep lake does not reach atmospheric saturation with respect to dissolved oxygen at any time during the year, ventilation of the deep water appears to be incomplete. During periods of seasonal stratification, the active input of hydrothermally enriched fluids, produces heterogeneities and instabilities in the density structure of the deep lake that may drive deep-lake mixing. As a result of these and other mixing processes, Crater Lake remains relatively well mixed, despite its great depth.																			2169-9275	2169-9291				OCT 15	1993	98	C10					18295	18307		10.1029/93JC01603	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/93JC01603													WOS:A1993MC28600019

Effects of water storage and delivery on spawning activity of endangered Lost River Suckers in Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Objective Lake-spawning Lost River Suckers Deltistes luxatus in Upper Klamath Lake spawn in shallow shoreline locations where springs discharge into the lake. Because of the shallow depths of the spawning habitat, water management that changes lake surface elevation during the spawning season could cause behavioral changes in spawning fish due to reduced available habitat and decreasing depths. Our goal was to examine the association between lake surface elevation, including rapid declines in lake surface elevation, and the interannual use of specific spawning sites, fidelity to these sites, daily spawning activity, and spawning duration.Methods We quantified the number of springs visited annually by individual Lost River Suckers and investigated variation in use of specific springs during different environmental conditions. We constructed generalized additive models to describe patterns in the daily number of unique sucker detections at the shoreline springs during the spawning season relative to environmental covariates. Lastly, we used extended Cox models with time-varying covariates to test hypotheses about the effects of lake surface elevation on the amount of time from the first to last annual detections of suckers at the shoreline springs.Results Low surface elevations in Upper Klamath Lake reduced the number of springs visited by lake-spawning Lost River Suckers and affected spring usage. Site fidelity to specific springs during typical years was evident, but spawning activity primarily took place at two of the four springs during years with low lake surface elevation. Lake surface elevation and rapid declines in surface elevation were not related to total daily unique sucker detections at the springs, but rapid declines were limited in our data. Low lake surface elevations resulted in a reduced duration between the first and last detections at the springs for both females and males.Conclusions Low Upper Klamath Lake surface elevations were associated with Lost River Suckers visiting a reduced number of spawning sites, which spawning sites were primarily visited, and shorter durations between the first and last detections. Although rapid declines in lake surface elevation did not have an effect in any of our models, this result is limited to the magnitude of declines in lake surface elevation documented in our data, which was small. Larger declines may influence spawning sucker behavior. Our results indicate that the timing and magnitude of water storage and delivery from Upper Klamath Lake can reduce the number of spawning sites used, spawning activity, and spawning duration for Lost River Suckers. Our study provides an example of how water storage and delivery in lakes can affect vulnerable fish populations.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				OCT	2025	45	5					874	890		10.1093/najfmt/vqaf073	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/najfmt/vqaf073		AUG 2025											WOS:001555794900001

However, these dinoflagellates have often been observed in many water bodies over the past two and a half decades. We investigated Ceratium furcoides' abundance and morphological variation during its initial phase of colonization (2012-2013) in two subtropical reservoirs in southern Brazil in order to explore which environmental factors were related to the occurrence, persistence and bloom formation of this dinoflagellate in those environments. Biomass of C. furcoides showed a strong seasonal pattern, in which warm seasons led to an increase in population density, resulting in cell-size reduction, while in the cold seasons cells increased in volume. Maximum densities over 2,500 cells ml(-1) were observed in spring-summer periods in both reservoirs. C. furcoides' abundance in the studied reservoirs was associated, primarily, with a combination of optimal conditions of temperature, organic matter, and pH, and secondarily, with nutrient availability. The possible factors for the successful colonization performed by C. furcoides across distinct Brazilian waterbodies include good swimming performance, low herbivory pressure, and ability to form dense blooms, as strategies that allow maintenance of populations and effective dispersal.

J	Tavernini, S				Tavernini, Silvia			Seasonal and inter-annual zooplankton dynamics in temporary pools with different hydroperiods	LIMNOLOGICA												The results of a research carried out in 2001 on nine temporary mountain pools (Northern Apennines, Italy) underlined a major role of hydroperiod in shaping zooplankton communities of temporary habitats. In 2002, the same pools were studied to assess inter-annual differences in zooplankton seasonal patterns. Data on precipitations (both snow and rainfalls) were collected to evaluate the influence of precipitation regimes on hydroperiod and concurrently on hydrochemical features and zooplankton dynamics. Mean annual snow and rainfall abundances were highly similar in both years but precipitation patterns were different. Moreover, different air temperatures were measured in the 2 years of study. These factors influenced water persistence and dry and wet cycles in the pools: in 2001, three pools dried out in summer and remained dry until autumn rainfalls (type A pools), in five pools (type B pools) the summer dry period was interrupted by re-filling due to storms in July and only in one pool water did remain for the entire research period (Cl). In 2002, type A and B pools underwent only one dry phase (June-July) while Cl showed a hydroperiod similar to the one that occurred in the previous year. Overall, type A and B pools can be classified as 'seasonal' and Cl as 'near-permanent or permanent'. Principal component analysis and paired t-tests did not show significant differences between years in the hydrochemical features of the pools. However, the seasonal pools showed a wide range of variation in their hydrochemical parameters while water features of the permanent pool presented less variability. Within the pools, divergences in the number and in the type of zooplankton taxa between the 2 years were limited. Rotifer and copepod density of the seasonal pools were comparable over years and only cladocerans exhibited distinct density dynamics. Cladoceran appeared to be associated with ionic content and influenced by the occurrence of ice-melting and by the wet phase length of the pools. On the contrary, the permanent pool showed diverse zooplankton seasonal patterns in 2001 compared to 2002. Over years, different pH values were measured; pH and conductivity varied with changing water volume, which in turn explained a significant amount of the observed variation in zooplankton densities in 2002.

We investigated the effect of different spring warming scenarios on the succession of three algal groups (cyanobacteria, diatoms and green algae) in 10-l microcosms. We fitted these microcosm data to a simple mechanistic model to estimate the effect of different climate warming scenarios on the population dynamics of these algal functional groups. Experimental and model results indicate that the different algal functional groups respond differently to climate warming under phosphorus-limited conditions. Whereas the successional sequence, from diatoms to green algae to cyanobacteria, was not affected by the different climate warming scenarios, cyanobacteria showed a stronger response to the different climate warming scenarios than diatoms or green algae. Both the growth rates and peak abundances of cyanobacteria were significantly higher in the average and warm spring scenarios than in the cold spring scenario. Our findings illustrate that integration of models and microcosm experiments are a useful approach in predicting the impacts of rising temperatures on the dynamics of phytoplankton communities.

The lake was subsequently restocked with a higher population density of piscivores. The effect of this biomanipulation on the phytoplankton and zooplankton communities and on total nutrient concentrations was monitored at fortnightly intervals during the summers, from May 1980-Sept. 1982. The abundance of phytoplankton was much lower after biomanipulation and was consistent with observed changes in Secchi disc transparency, total attenuation coefficient and chlorophyll a concentration. Zooplankters were also less abundant in 1981 and 1982 but the decrease in numbers was more than offset by the large increase in the mean sizes of the zooplankters present, so that the estimated grazing pressures in 1981 and 1982 were at least double the 1980 value. Daphnia, rare in 1980, became the dominant genus in 1981 and 1982, and a shift to progressively larger-bodied Daphnia species was observed. Although total N and total P levels were generally lower after biomanipulation, their decline could not explain the reduction in phytoplankton abundance which was attributed to the increased grazing pressure. Possible causes of the observed declines in nutrient concentrations are discussed.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1984	14	4					371	383																WOS:A1984TD49100004

During the study, mean cell density of APP at 1 m deep varied seasonally two orders of magnitude from 2.2 x 10(3) to 3.2 x 10(5) cells mL(-1). At upstream sites of Penrith and North Richmond, higher cell density was observed from summer to autumn. There were three cell types of APP (i.e. coccoid, Ellipsoid and rod-shaped). Proportionally, coccoid cells increased downstream from 25 to 52 % of total cells, whereas ellipsoid and rod-shaped cells decreased downstream from 64 to 47 % and from to 1 % of total cells, respectively. The vertical distribution of APP (1 and 4 m deep), examined for 9 months at North Richmond, showed that overall mean density at 1 m was significantly higher than overall mean density at 4 m. Overall, the cell density of APP at 1 m deep was positively correlated with temperature and total chlorophpll a. The present results suggest that APP may need to be incorporated into a conceptual model of river plankton food webs.																			0370-047X					DEC 22	2000	122						79	88																WOS:000169255200005
J	Han, HJ; Hu, WP				Han, Hongjuan; Hu, Weiping			Modeling the species shift from Potamogeton malaianus Miq. to Potamogeton maackianus A. Bennett in the experiment pond	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The outdoor pond experiment has been conducted from 2005 September till now, during which an interesting phenomenon of submerged macrophyte species shift was observed in 2007. A new macrophyte species, Potamogeton maackianus A. Bennett, appeared in 2007, and replaced the original species, Potamogeton malaianus Miq. gradually over 10 months. In order to describe the submerged macrophyte species shift from Potamogeton malaianus to Potamogeton maackianus, a structural dynamic model had been developed by using eco-exergy index as the goal function, coupling the size functions of main biological components of the field experimental pond ecosystem. There were totally 5 size functions, including individual size of macrophyte, phytoplankton and zoobenthos, and leaf area index of macrophyte and photosynthetic area index of phytoplankton. The main physiological parameters (such as maximum growth rate, mortality rate and so on) of macrophyte, phytoplankton and zoobenthos had been characterized by the above concerned size functions. Eco-exergy index was optimized based on different combinations of these 5 size functions, which were changed +/- 5%, +/- 10%, +/- 15%, and +/- 20% every 10 days during the simulation. The model yielded acceptable calibrations by comparing with the results from the pond experiments for the key state variables: total biomass of macrophyte, total dissolved nitrogen and phosphorous and organic nitrogen and phosphorous from September 22, 2005 to December 31, 2008. During the calibration period, the submerged macrophyte decreased in size gradually, while its leaf area index, maximum growth rate, biomass and the system eco-exergy index were all characterized with seasonal pattern, increasing from spring, reaching peak in summer and decreasing from autumn. The results showed that leaf area index was a meaningful parameter in the size functions and it determined the changes of eco-exergy index by translating into the biomass of the submerged macrophyte. The submerged macrophyte species shift happened in the experiment pond may due to the fitness of these two submerged macrophytes to the changes of the nutrients level. P. malaianus can be adaptable in higher nutrients water volume, while P. maackianus prefers lower nutrients environment. The nutrients content in the experimental pond was decreasing with time as to sustain the lives cycling. P. malaianus varied its size distributions to adapt the nutrients perturbations, afterwards when nutrients level decreased to some extent P. malaianus could not afford, P. maackianus took over rapidly enough to assure ecosystem stability and the ecosystem keep developing.

J	Sorguç, BU; Demirkalp, FY; Saygi, Y				Sorguc, Bura Ugur; Demirkalp, Fatma Yildiz; Saygi, Yasemin			Driving factors affecting zooplankton functional groups in a shallow eutrophic lake	OCEANOLOGICAL AND HYDROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES												The important role of zooplankton in linking different trophic levels has been the subject of extensive research, highlighting their crucial contribution to aquatic ecosystems and energy flow. Classification of organisms into functional groups using a method that combines taxonomic assessments with direct functional measurements is very effective in understanding their interactions with the environment. Our objective was to determine the seasonal changes of zooplankton in Lake Yeni & ccedil;a & gbreve;a using zooplankton functional groups. A total of 19 zooplankton species were identified in the lake and classified into six functional groups. Medium-sized cladoceran and copepod carnivorous feeders (MCC) accounted for 45.74% of all functional groups and were the dominant group in the lake. Throughout the year, medium and large zooplankton generally dominated in the lake, with smaller functional groups briefly dominating in spring and autumn. Statistical analysis indicates that medium-sized cladoceran and copepod filter feeders (MCF) and large-sized cladoceran and copepod filter feeders (LCF) showed a positive relationship with Secchi depth and a negative relationship with chlorophyll a. Other groups exhibited relatively lower correlations with environmental parameters. It can be concluded that the observed seasonal changes in these groups are affected not only by environmental parameters, but also by the availability of food resources.

During summer, C. pengoi can attain high densities by parthenogenetic reproduction, but during most of the year, it survives as sexually produced resting eggs in bottom sediments, and yearly recruitment is dependent on the survival and hatching of these eggs. Sediments were sampled at open sea sites in the Gulf of Finland, the Gulf of Bothnia and the Baltic Proper from 2007 to 2009. C. pengoi eggs were most abundant (up to 26 x 10(3) m(-2)) in the Gulf of Finland, whereas farther north in the Gulf of Bothnia, the numbers were lower (up to 3 x 10(3) m(-2)). This reflects the invasion history of C. pengoi in the Baltic Sea, and is in agreement with its average yearly planktonic abundance. Hatching success varied substantially between sites, but at least some eggs hatched from all sites, even those suffering from persistent anoxia. However, as the incubation time needed for hatching was long (average 7 to 74 d), and some of the viable eggs were buried deep in the sediment, recruitment from the open sea sediments is possibly low, especially in the Gulf of Bothnia. C. pengoi recruitment in spring or summer originates likely from coastal sites.

In order to improve water quality in downstream waterbodies, the Manitoba government is currently investigating the relationship between hydrological standard of agricultural drainage network and nutrient retention in the drainage systems. Briefly, oversized drains have more capacity to transport nutrients, which can increase nutrient loading to downstream waterbodies, especially during rainfall events. Currently, the hydrological standards of agricultural drainage design in Manitoba were mainly developed according to cost-benefit analysis without considering nutrient retention. The purpose of this study was to use computer modelling techniques to simulate the impact of drain size (based on different hydrological standards) on nutrient retention within an agricultural drainage network. The site chosen was the Tobacco Creek Watershed, an agricultural area which drains into the Red River, and thence into Lake Winnipeg. Suspended sediment, nutrient and flow data, from several locations along the Brown drain within this watershed, were used to calibrate a water quality model. Scenarios were then simulated with the model to estimate how different drain sizes affect nutrient transport and retention. Sampling took place during the spring and summer of 2013 starting with freshet and ending when the drains dried up near mid-summer. Study results indicated that the amount of nutrients transported was generally greater during freshet and summer rain storms. Occasionally, however, nutrients in summer discharge exceeded those transported during freshet. The water quality model was applied to the Brown drain to investigate the effects of different drain sizes for rainfall amounts under 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 year return periods. Generally the results indicate that as the return periods became larger (in larger channels) lower nutrients concentrations were predicted downstream (higher decay rates). On average, the model predicted a 15%-20% decline in nutrient concentration with a 20-year return channel design compared to a 2-year return. The research from this study may provide an impetus to the policy-making process of drainage design.					; Luo, Bin/IXD-5391-2023; Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich/AFM-9194-2022	Sadeghian, Amir/0000-0003-4157-0176; 													0920-4741	1573-1650				MAR	2017	31	4					1305	1321		10.1007/s11269-017-1578-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-017-1578-9													WOS:000397923700014

Paliwodzizna 29 is such as site, being a series of pits and hearths at the edge of Lake Grodno in Central Poland. A combination of faunal analysis, lithostratigraphy, pollen, diaspores, charcoal and sedaDNA from the site revealed seasonal collecting-type occupation based on the catching of pike (a superfood) in the spring in the early Mesolithic, but a different foraging-type pattern of occupation probably in the summer in the late Mesolithic. Subtle human impacts on the local environment are also seen, including probably burning of some woodland and reed-beds as well as localized soil erosion. This analysis reveals the potential of both such sites, and the combined methodology, for the testing of theoretical models of human mobility and activities in the Mesolithic.

Various strains and age classes of marked brook trout were stocked annually and the population was inventoried semi annually to evaluate survival, growth, and reproductive success. The Woods Lake brook trout population was dominated by young, stocked fish throughout the maintenance liming period of 1985-89. Based on spring emergent fry trap catches and fall trap net cathces of unmarked fish, only one naturally produced year class (1986) was successfully recruited to the Woods Lake brook trout population. Low annual survival rates (< 20%) of juvenile trout were observed throughout the study period. Although initial growth rates and condition of young trout were satisfactory, increased intraspecific competition for food resulted in declining growth rates and condition of older age classes. Fall standing crops of brook trout remained at relatively low levels of 6 to 10 kg ha-1 and both production per unit biomass and growth efficiency decreased over the 5-yr. Repeated whole lake liming and limited spawning habitat improvement were not sufficient to sustain brook trout natural reproduction in Woods Lake. Low productivity, marginal spawning habitat quality, and low survival rates of stocked trout in Woods Lake resulted in the failure to establish a self maintaining, productive brook trout population in Woods Lake.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				SEP	1991	59	1-2					41	53																WOS:A1991GP46500004

Climate change and nutrient dynamics, driven by rapid urbanization, have markedly altered their frequency and extent. Urbanization intensifies human disturbances while enhancing nutrient management, making the evolution of algal blooms in urban lakes uncertain. The combined effects of climate change and urbanization on the phenology and spatiotemporal distribution of algal blooms are poorly understood. This study analyzed algal bloom occurrences in Tangxun Lake, a representative urban lake, from 1986 to 2023 using Landsat imagery. Utilizing the PLUS and InVEST models, we also simulated land use changes and nutrient inputs in the watershed, assessing their combined impacts with climate change. Results revealed that algal blooms primarily occur from March to October, exhibiting strong seasonal patterns. The starting time of algal blooms is predominantly driven by spring precipitation, while the termination time and duration depend on winter temperatures. Although the phenological characteristics fluctuated, the outbreak area significant decreased due to reduced nutrient inputs and effective watershed management during urbanization, mitigating climate warming effects. These findings enhance understanding of algal bloom dynamics under climate and urbanization pressures, providing insights for sustainable urban development and lake management.

Urea concentrations varied from 0.25 mu M in surface layer to 3.36 mu M in profundal zone of studied lakes and were in the range of concentrations noted in other non-polluted freshwater habitats. In the photic zone of lakes of GMLS Urea N made up to 10 % the total DON pool and often exceeded 2-3 times of NH4+-N concentrations. Pattern of changes in urea concentrations observed during three-years study excludes external urea input and suggests supplementation of lake waters with this compounds by phytoplankton decomposition processes. Generally, urea concentrations were negatively correlated with the trophic state index calculated from "algal" as well as from "bacterial" determinants. However, more detailed analysis showed that the relationships between production and assimilation of urea by various plankton components as well as the ecological role of this compound in meso- and eutrophic lakes could be different.

The scales over which these processes occur and their sensitivity to increasing summer surface temperatures are not well understood. This study investigated horizontal mixing between nearshore and offshore areas of Lake Superior over the 10-year period from 2003 to 2012 using a realistically forced three-dimensional numerical model and virtual tracers. An age tracer was used to characterize the time scales of horizontal mixing between nearshore areas of the lake where water depth is less than 100 m and deeper areas. The age of water in nearshore areas increased and decreased in an annual cycle corresponding to the lake's dimictic cycle of vertical mixing and stratification. Interannual variability of mixing in the isothermal period was significantly correlated to average springtime wind speed, whereas variability during the stratified season was correlated to the average summer surface temperature. Dispersal of a passive tracer released from nine locations around the model lake's perimeter was more extensive in late summer when stratification was established lakewide than in early summer. The distribution of eddies resolved in the model reflected differences between the early and late summer dispersal patterns. In the eastern part of the lake dispersal was primarily alongshore, reflecting counterclockwise coastal circulation. In the western part of the lake, cross-shore mixing was enhanced by cross-basin currents.

Two adjoining pairs of images of the central North Island were acquired on two different days in summer and spring 2002. 6sv atmospheric correction was compared to the cosine of the solar zenith angle correction (COST) dark object subtraction (DOS) atmospheric correction. The highest correlation between 6sv ln(Band 3) water surface reflectance and ln(chl a) was found in the 24 January 2002 image (r(2) = 0.954). 6sv atmospheric correction was preferable to COST-DOS as it gave more realistic reflectance values at a clear-water reference site and produced the highest correlation coefficient.

In this study, a high-resolution acid-dissolved Mn record of lacustrine sediments from a drilling core (SG-1) in the arid western Qaidam Basin on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP) largely reveals the evolution of lake levels and climate change over the last 600 kyr. The climate in the western Qaidam Basin shows distinct glacial and interglacial changes in accordance with changes in the global climate, and in North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SSTs), indicating the teleconnection between the basin's climate and the North Atlantic in the form of the Westerlies. However, the basin's climate also correlates closely with East Asian Winter Monsoon (EAWM) activity as recorded by the grain size variations in loess-paleosol sequences on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) over a glacial-interglacial timescale. Even during glacial periods, some relatively warm/humid stages accompanied by high paleolake levels in the western Qaidam Basin are generally conformable with relatively weak EAWM, whereas these warm/humid stages show a weak relation with the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) and North Atlantic SSTs. These results collectively provide evidence that climate change in the western Qaidam Basin is, and was, not only controlled by the Westerlies, but also strongly influenced by the Siberian High, at least during glacial periods. The exact driving mechanism, however, needs to be explored further in future studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Impact of changing DOC concentrations on the potential distribution of acid sensitive biota in a boreal stream network	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												DOC concentrations have increased in many surface waters in Europe and North America over the past few decades. As DOC exudes a strong influence on pH this DOC increase could have detrimental effects on acid sensitive biota in many streams and lakes. To investigate the potential implications of changes in the DOC concentration on stream water biota, we have used a mesoscale boreal stream network in northern Sweden as a case study. The network was sampled for stream water chemistry at 60 locations during both winter base flow and spring flood periods, representing the extremes experienced annually in these streams both in terms of discharge and acidity. The effect of changing DOC on pH was modeled for all sampling locations using an organic acid model, with input DOC concentrations for different scenarios adjusted by between -30% and +50% from measured present concentrations. The resulting effect on pH was then used to quantify the proportion of stream length in the catchment with pH below the acid thresholds of pH 5.5 and pH 5.0. The results suggest that a change in stream water DOC during base flow would have only a limited effect on pH and hence on the stream length with pH below the acid thresholds. During the spring flood on the other hand a change in DOC would strongly influence pH and the stream length with pH below the acid thresholds. For example an increase in DOC concentration of 30% at all sites would increase the proportion of stream length with pH below 5.5 from 37% to 65%, and the proportion of stream length with pH below 5.0 would increase from 18% to 27%. The results suggest that in high DOC waters, even a marginal change in the DOC concentration could impact acid sensitive biota in a large portion of the aquatic landscape.					; Laudon, Hjalmar/J-3074-2013	Buffam, Ishi/0000-0002-2625-6640; Laudon, Hjalmar/0000-0001-6058-1466													1027-5606	1607-7938					2008	12	2					425	435		10.5194/hess-12-425-2008	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-12-425-2008													WOS:000256968000010

This ecologically disadvantageous phenomenon is called polarized light pollution. We have observed that the water between the concrete walls of a harbour of the Hungarian Lake Balaton is continuously dark from autumn to spring due to the inflow of a canal rich in dissolved humic substances. Using ground-born imaging polarimetry, we demonstrated that this dark water patch reflects light with higher degrees of polarization than the brighter lake water. Our hypothesis was that the stronger horizontally polarized light reflected from the dark water patch is more attractive to swarming, water-seeking and egg-laying non-biting midges (Chironomidae) than the surrounding brighter lake water. With larval samplings, we showed that both the density and the average size of chironomid larvae were significantly larger in the harbour than in the surrounding lake. This finding may represent an ecological advantage of polarized light pollution: polarotactic chironomids are intensely attracted to a strongly and horizontally polarizing, seasonally dark water patch at the canal inflow, where the abundance of larvae increases. It should be taken into consideration that increased larval abundance might result in increased swarming intensity which could affect humans by causing considerable nuisance.

A high-resolution summer temperature reconstruction for the eastern Swiss Alps back to AD 1580 derived from proglacial varved sediments	HOLOCENE												We found a significant positive correlation between local summer air temperature (May-September) and the annual sediment mass accumulation rate (MAR) in Lake Silvaplana (46 degrees N, 9 degrees E, 1800 in a.s.l.) during the twentieth century (r = 0.69, p < 0.001 for decadal smoothed series). Sediment trap data (2001-2005) confirm this relation with exceptionally high particle yields during the hottest summer of the last 140 years in 2003. On this base we developed a decadal-scale summer temperature reconstruction back to AD 1580. Surprisingly, the comparison of our reconstruction with two other independent regional summer temperature reconstructions (based on tree-rings and documentary data) revealed a significant negative correlation for the pre-1900 data (ie, late 'Little Ice Age'). This demonstrates that the correlation between MAR and summer temperature is not stable in time and the actualistic principle does not apple in this case. We suggest that different climatic regimes (modern/'Little Ice Age') lead to changing state conditions in the catchment and thus to considerably different sediment transport mechanisms. Therefore, we calibrated our MAR data with gridded early instrumental temperature series from AD 1760-1880 (r = - 0.48, p < 0.01 for decadal smoothed series) to properly reconstruct the late LIA climatic conditions. We found exceptionally low temperatures between AD 1580 and 1610 (0.75 degrees C below twentieth-century mean) and during the late Maunder Minimum from AD 1680 to 1710 (0.5 degrees C below twentieth-century mean). In general, summer temperatures did not experience major negative departures from the twentieth-century mean during the late 'Little Ice Age'. This compares well with the two existing independent regional reconstructions suggesting that the LIA in the Alps was mainly a phenomenon of the cold season.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				JAN	2007	17	1					51	63		10.1177/0959683607073278	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683607073278													WOS:000244644300005

To study the sexual cycle and fecundity of the Patagonian silverside, a species of high commercial and sport value, from Ezequiel Ramos Mexia reservoir (Neuquen, Rio Negro; Argentina). Materials and methods. Sampling was conducted between 1982 and 1986, and 9307 specimens were collected. The sexual cycle was studied by macroscopic observation of the gonads and fecundity was assessed using the volumetric method. Results. Length at first maturity (L-m 50%) was estimated by fitting a logistic curve. Spawning took place in spring and early summer (September to December). Length at first maturity was 244.37 mm (Lt) in females. Absolute fecundity ranged between 3.976 oocytes in a 296 mm (Lt), 190 g female and 20.879 oocytes in a 420 mm (Lt), 704 g female. Conclusions. No significant relation was found between relative fecundity and total length. The sex ratio was approximately 1:1 at intermediate length classes, but females predominated in the larger classes. The ovarian cycle was highly seasonal and coincided with that of populations from other Patagonian environments. Fecundity, on the other hand, was higher than that observed at Moreno Lake, in the Andean region.																			0122-0268					SEP-DEC	2009	13	3					1446	1455																WOS:000271275700003

The mean snow thickness was 5.2 and 1.6 cm in these winters, due to low winter precipitation. The mean ice thickness was 50.9 and 36.1 cm, and the ice growth rate was 3.6 and 2.1 mm day(-1) at the lower boundary of ice. Analyses of mass and heat balance data from two winters revealed that the surface heat budget was governed by solar radiation and terrestrial radiation. The net heat flux loss of the ice was 9-22 W m(-2), affected by the snow and ice thickness. Compared to boreal lakes, Lake Wuliangsuhai received more solar radiation and heat flux from the water. The ice temperature had a strong diurnal variation, which was produced by the diurnal cycles of solar radiation, and air and water temperatures. These results expand our knowledge of the evolution of mass and heat balance in temperate lakes of mid-latitude arid areas.

Concordance of Interannual Variability in Ice Regime of Baikal and Lake Ladoga	GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES												We examine the dependence of the ice conditions for two major lakes of Asia and Europe: Baikal and Ladoga, on regional values of the arithmetic sums of mean daily winter air temperatures and global atmospheric processes expressed by atmospheric circulation indices. By ranking the winters according to the sums of mean daily winter air temperatures, it was possible to identify winters of the same type of severity for the regions of Baikal and Ladoga. The winters of the same type show an enhancement in correlations between ice characteristics with respect to the sums of winter air temperatures and atmospheric circulation indices as well as ice characteristics of the two lakes. It is shown that the interannual changers in characteristics of ice regime of Ladoga and Baikal are largely determined by the same atmospheric processes. The role of the circulation is most clearly manifested in variation of temperature regime indicators. Thus, the sums of air temperatures accumulated during a winter in the regions of these lakes show primarily the closest correlation with the Arctic and North Atlantic oscillation indices.

At present, there is insufficient research on the coupling mechanisms between nutrients and heavy metals, especially between heavy metals in suspended particles. In this paper, spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of nutrients dissolved heavy metals, and heavy metals in suspended particles were analyzed in a seasonally stratified reservoir. Combined with the nitrogen and phosphorus biogeochemical process, the coupling mechanisms between heavy metals and nutrients were discussed. The results showed that the Aha Reservoir had temperature and dissolved oxygen stratification in April and July. The reduction and dissolution of Fe and Mn oxide/hydroxide and the resuspension of sediments might result in a simultaneous increase in the concentrations of nutrients, dissolved heavy metals and heavy metals in suspended particles in hypolimnion in July and October. In the presence of dissimilatory iron-reducing bacteria (DRIB), the dissolution of iron-bound phosphorus in sediments and suspended particulate matter (SPM) might lead to the simultaneous release of iron and phosphorus into the water. The dissolution of metal sulfides in the sediments and SPM under the action of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) bacteria might lead to the simultaneous release of ammonia nitrogen and heavy metals into the water. Due to the coupling between nitrogen and phosphorus and heavy metals, seasonal stratified reservoir may face the risk of periodic simultaneous pollution of eutrophication and heavy metals in summer and autumn. This research provides theoretical support for the treatment of heavy metal and eutrophication combined pollution in karst areas.					; Wang, Yiyao/GZN-2554-2022	Ding, Shiyuan/0000-0003-3857-4053; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2022	29	2					1937	1948		10.1007/s11356-021-15776-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-15776-4		AUG 2021						34363164					WOS:000682420300004

There are four main hot springs in Rwanda, such as: Kalisimbi, Bugarama, Kinigi, and Nyamyumba, formerly named Gisenyi hot springs. It is often believed that soaking in a hot spring is a great way to naturally detox human skin. This research focuses on the geochemical analysis of Nyamyumba hot springs, located near the fresh water supply of Lake Kivu, with the purpose of understanding its healing capacity and safety. The Nyamyumba hot springs are located in the western branch of the East African Rift System, near the Virunga volcanic complex, which explains the rising and heating mechanism of the water. The concentrations of sulfate, iron, ammonia, silica, and phosphate, and the conductivity, alkalinity, and salinity of the water were measured using standard procedures. The results showed that the hot spring water has higher concentrations of chemicals compared to the Lake Kivu water, and the geochemistry of these hot springs may be associated with rock dissolution by hot water. The measured parameters were compared with World Health Organization (WHO) standards for recreational waters, and it has been identified that the Nyamyumba hot springs are safe to use for swimming and therapeutic activities.

The TSS concentrations and flux, TN flux and TP flux, river runoff flux were be monitored and calculated systematically in Baoxiang River, the results shows that: (1) the annual TSS quantity transported by Baoxiang River into Dianchi Lake was 578.86t. Urban areas were the major transported areas of TSS, and summer and autumn were the main transported periods. (2) TSS has a certain correlation with TN (R-2=0.28, P<0.01, n=72) and TP (R-2=0.34, P<0.01, n=72), but there correlations were not significant. However, the correlations of river runoff flux with TN and TP were significant, it indicated that liquid phase was the main factor affecting TN TP fluxes, priority should be given to liquid phase when dealing with TN and TP pollution. The results can provide a basis for eutrophication control of urban rivers and nonpoint pollution management of Dianchi Lake River basin.

N loading from land to streams is expected to increase in North European temperate lakes due to higher winter rainfall and changes in cropping patterns. Scenario (IPCC, A2) analyses using a number of models of various complexity for Danish streams and lakes suggest an increase in runoff and N transport on an annual basis (higher during winter and typically lower during summer) in streams, a slight increase in N concentrations in streams despite higher losses in riparian wetlands, higher absolute retention of N in lakes (but not as percentage of loading), but only minor changes in lake water concentrations. However, when taking into account also a predicted higher temperature there is a risk of higher frequency and abundance of potentially toxic cyanobacteria in lakes and they may stay longer during the season. Somewhat higher risk of loss of submerged macrophytes at increased N and phosphorus (P) loading and a shift to dominance of small-sized fish preying upon the key grazers on phytoplankton may also enhance the risk of lake shifts from clear to turbid in a warmer North European temperate climate. However, it must be emphasised that the prediction of N transport and thus effects is uncertain as the prediction of regional precipitation and changes in land-use is uncertain. By contrast, N loading is expected to decline in warm temperate and arid climates. However, in warm arid lakes much higher N concentrations are currently observed despite reduced external loading. This is due to increased evapotranspiration leading to higher nutrient concentrations in the remaining water, but may also reflect a low-oxygen induced reduction of nitrification. Therefore, the critical N as well as P loading for good ecological state in lakes likely has to be lower in a future warmer climate in both north temperate and Mediterranean lakes. To obtain this objective, adaptation measures are required. In both climate zones the obvious methods are to change agricultural practices for reducing the loss of nutrients to surface waters, to improve sewage treatment and to reduce the storm-water nutrient runoff. In north temperate zones adaptations may also include re-establishment of artificial and natural wetlands, introduction of riparian buffer zones and re-meandering of channelised streams, which may all have a large impact on, not least, the N loading of lakes. In the arid zone, also restrictions on human use of water are urgently needed, not least on the quantity of water used for irrigation purposes.

J	Ransom, TS				Ransom, Tami S.			Comparison of direct, indirect, and ecosystem engineering effects of an earthworm on the red-backed salamander	ECOLOGY												In addition to creating or modifying habitat, ecosystem engineers interact with other species as predators, prey, or competitors. The earthworm, Lumbricus terrestris, interacts with the common woodland salamander, Plethodon cinereus, via: (1) ecosystem engineering, by providing burrows that are used as a refuge, (2) direct effects as a prey item, and (3) indirectly, by competing with microinvertebrates, another prey item for P. cinereus. Using enclosures in the forest, I examined the relative strengths of these component pathways between seasons and salamander age classes. I found that the relative strength (partial g 2) of the positive direct (trophic) effect of L. terrestris on the change in mass of P. cineresus was greater than that of the negative indirect effect, but only in summer. Positive effects of ecosystem engineering were only evident over the winter as increased adult survival. This research has implications for how habitat provisioning complements more well-studied species interactions, such as competition and predation, within communities.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				OCT	2012	93	10					2198	2207		10.1890/11-2024.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/11-2024.1								23185881					WOS:000310563400007
J	SPAULDING, SA; WARD, JV; BARON, J				SPAULDING, SA; WARD, JV; BARON, J			WINTER PHYTOPLANKTON DYNAMICS IN A SUB-ALPINE LAKE, COLORADO, USA	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The temporal dynamics of phytoplankton were examined in The Loch, a subalpine lake in Rocky Mountain National Park, over the winter seasons of 1987-88 and 1988 - 89. The Loch was ice-covered from early November until early to mid May. The pattern of phytoplankton biovolume during ice-cover was consistent between the two years with maxima occurring in November/December and February/March. This pattern resulted principally from the contribution of Asterionella formosa HASS. Other dominant phytoplankton species in terms of biomass (Dinobryon sertularia EHRENB., Cryptomonas ovata EHRENB., and Peridinium cinctum (MULL.) EHRENB.) collectively contributed from 10 to 90% of the total cells. Algal composition changed throughout the winter and individual species varied in abundance with depth. The same dominant (and most of the rare) taxa were present both years. They varied in time of occurrence and abundance, but did not occur at the same time in both years. Phytoplankton species composition continually fluctuated throughout the winter. Because of the stability afforded by ice-cover, algal species succession was not driven by thermal regime or by wind induced changes in the mixed depth. Nor did grazing by the winter zooplankton assemblage, composed nearly exclusively of cyclopoid copepods and rotifers, adequately explain the phytoplankton dynamics. Freeze concentration of water (concentration as ions are excluded in the formation of ice) in early winter may be responsible for the early phytoplankton bloom.

Recent research has highlighted high concentrations of solutes including trace elements in RG-fed waters, with negative implications on water quality. Yet, sparse studies from a few locations hinder conclusions about the main drivers solute export from RGs. Here, in an unprecedented effort, we collected published and unpublished data on rock glacier hydrochemistry around the globe. We considered 201 RG springs from mountain ranges across Europe, North and South America, using a combination of machine learning, multivariate and univariate analyses, and geochemical modeling. We found that 35 % of springs issuing from intact RGs (containing internal ice) have water quality below drinking water standards, compared to 5 % of springs connected to relict RGs (without internal ice). The interaction of ice and bedrock lithology is responsible for solute concentrations in RG springs. Indeed, we found higher concentrations of sulfate and trace elements in springs sourcing from intact RGs compared to water originating from relict RGs, mostly in specific lithological settings. Enhanced sulfide oxidation in intact RGs is responsible for the elevated trace element concentrations. Challenges for water management may arise in mountain catchments rich in intact RGs, and where the predisposing geology would make these areas geochemical RG hotspots.

Quantitative assessment of Naegleria fowleri and fecal indicator bacteria in brackish water of Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Brackish water samples from Lake Pontchartrain in Louisiana were assessed for the presence of pathogenic amoeba Naegleria fowleri, which causes primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). In our study, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) methods were used to determine N. fowleri, E. coli, and enterococci in water collected from Lake Pontchartrain. N. fowleri target sequence was detected in 35.4% (56/158) of the water samples from ten sites around the lake. Statistically significant positive correlations between N. fowleri concentration and water temperature as well as E. coli (qPCR) were observed. Multiple linear regression (MLR) model shows seasonal factor (summer or winter) has significant effect on the concentration of N. fowleri, E. coli and enterococci (qPCR) concentration. Significant positive relationships between E. coli and enterococci was observed from both qPCR (r = 0.25) and culture based method (r = 0.54). Meanwhile, significant positive correlation between qPCR and culture based methods for enterococci concentration was observed (r = 0.33). In our study, water temperature and E. coli concentration were indicative of N. fowleri concentrations in brackish water environment. Future research is needed to determine whether sediment is a source of N. fowleri found in the water column. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Ecological and biological status of Lake Idku has been monitored during (autumn 2012 to summer 2013) to examine the lake water quality and eutrophication level in response to the quality as well as the source of the discharging water. Discrete water samples were collected from the lake body and the drains. Chemical analyses revealed an excessive nutrient load goes into the lake. A range of 1.4-10.6 mg nitrites/L was determined for drain waters, however a sudden increase was observed in lake and drain water samples of up to 84 and 74.5 mg/L, respectively. Reactive silicate ranged between 2.9 and 4.8 mg/L; while inorganic phosphate fluctuated between 0.2 and 0.43 mg/L. Transparency varied from 45 cm to 134 cm with better light conditions at drain sites. Biological results indicated a hyper-eutrophic status for the lake with a range of chlorophyll-a varied from a minimum of 39.9 mu g/L (at Idku Drains) and a maximum of 104.2 mu g/L (at El-Khairy drain). Phytoplankton community structure revealed higher abundance at lake sites compared with the drains. Maximum phytoplankton density was detected during summer with the dominance of Bacilariophyceae (e.g. Cyclotella meneghiniana, Cyclotella comate, Melosira varians) followed by Chlorophycean taxon (e.g. Scenedesmus dimorphus, S. bijuga and Crucigenia tetrapedia). Five indices were applied to evaluate the water quality of the lake. Diversity Index (DI) indicated slight to light pollution along all sites; while Sapropic Index (SI) indicated slight pollution with acceptable oxygen conditions and an availability of sensitive species. Palmer Index (PI) gave a strong evidence of high organic pollution at some sites in the lake, while Generic Diatom Index (GDI) revealed that levels cif pollution varied from average to strong. Trophic Index (TI), suggest that there are an obvious signs of eutrophication in the lake. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Zhang, WT; Rao, YR				Zhang, Weitao; Rao, Yerubandi R.			Application of a eutrophication model for assessing water quality in Lake Winnipeg	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A eutrophication model using Water Analysis Simulation Program (WASP) has been applied to Lake Winnipeg during the period from 2002 to 2007. The model includes two nutrient cycles (N and P) and three functional phytoplankton groups (non-cyanobacteria, N-fixing cyanobacteria and non-N-fixing cyanobacteria). The model also considers distinct features of the morphological, hydrological, and climate conditions of the South and North Basins. The calibrated and validated results of water quality variables are in good agreement with the observed data of TN, NO3, NH4, TP, PO4, DO, and total chlorophyll-a. The model reproduced qualitative features of phytoplankton communities in space and time, such as cyanobacteria in the North Basin during the late summer and non-cyanobacteria in the South Basin during the spring. The non-N-fixing cyanobacteria showed an increasing trend, even though it occupied smaller percentage than N-fixer within total cyanobacteria. Multiple nutrient-reduction scenarios were examined to assess the potential influence of different N:P loading ratios on the lake ecosystem. A 10% reduction of phosphorus decreased the cyanobacteria percentage in both basins, and reduced peak values of chlorophyll-a concentration during late summer in the North Basin. However, model results indicate that this will promote growth of non-N-fixing cyanobacteria. A reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus loading by 10% will restrict non-N-fixing cyanobacteria. The averaged phytoplankton biomass (expressed as chlorophyll-a concentration) and phytoplankton components suggest that increasing N:P loading ratio (P reduction > 12% and N reduction < 7%) would be effective for improving water quality in Lake Winnipeg.

Its distribution appears to be restricted to an isolated subtropical region which has distinctive water quality parameters including ready availability of nutrients and relatively high chloride and hardness levels. Blooms of A. ovalisporum in Queensland, Australia, formed a thick brown surface scum from spring to autumn in newly constructed shallow lakes. During such blooms, the water and cellular material were both found to contain cylindrospermopsin, a water soluble toxin that produced fatty livers with hepatocyte necrosis in mice similar to the toxicity produced by Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (Wolosz.). Toxin levels in freeze-dried A. ovalisporum are approximately 25% of those present in freeze-dried C. raciborskii. However, A. ovalisporum appears to release more of the produced toxin into the water body than does C. raciborskii. Sequencing of the 16s ribosomal RNA gene of A. ovalisporum isolated from the Australian bloom showed that it was virtually identical to A. ovalisporum isolated from Lake Kinneret. Much lower homology was found between A. ovalisporum and other species of that genus (i.e., A. flos-aquae and A. gracile) or C. raciborskii, which is known to produce the toxin cylindrospermopsin.

The equations of the two sets of data did not differ significantly: animals were selected during the intermolting phase, thus excluding the effect of egg production. The length-standardized carbon content (C/L) changed exponentially with length until size at maturity was reached; in large-sized mature females it remained fairly constant, thus suggesting that above threshold food concentrations, variations should be mainly associated with egg production. The C:N ratio reflected changes in age, with higher values for newborn and a decrease of similar to 7% for specimens 20 days old (2 mm in length). The line of the equation obtained from the laboratory data set fitted well the data from a natural population in spring. Both carbon and nitrogen content were quite lower in summer, suggesting a marked decrease in available food. Changes in the intercept of In-transformed regression equations obtained assuming a slope between 2.7 and 3 (from the laboratory equations) seem to suggest that food limitation was taking place in summer. Nevertheless, the possibility of using the intercept values to infer food availability in natural environments is discussed.

The sex ratio, and gonadosomatic and hepatosomatic indices of Isaza caught by commercial bottom trawl and set net while migrating to and from an offshore pelagic area and nearshore spawning area were investigated in Lake Biwa from winter to early summer. Male spawning migrations preceded those of females. In addition, mortality during spawning was male-biased. Both findings suggested a possible impact of the commercial set net fishery on Isaza reproduction. Future conservation and fisheries management of the species need to be considered.

Occurrence, distribution and transport of pesticides into the Salton Sea Basin, California, 2001-2002	HYDROBIOLOGIA					Salton Sea Centennial Symposium/Symposium on Century of Symbiosis among Agriculture, Wildlife and People	MAR, 2005	San Diego, CA					The Salton Sea is a hypersaline lake located in southeastern California. Concerns over the ecological impacts of sediment quality and potential human exposure to dust emissions from exposed lakebed sediments resulting from anticipated shrinking of shoreline led to a study of pesticide distribution and transport within the Salton Sea Basin, California, in 2001-2002. Three sampling stations-upriver, river mouth, and offshore-were established along each of the three major rivers that discharge into the Salton Sea. Large-volume water samples were collected for analysis of pesticides in water and suspended sediments at the nine sampling stations. Samples of the bottom sediment were also collected at each site for pesticide analysis. Sampling occurred in October 2001, March-April 2002, and October 2002, coinciding with the regional fall and spring peaks in pesticide use in the heavily agricultural watershed. Fourteen current-use pesticides were detected in water and the majority of dissolved concentrations ranged from the limits of detection to 151 ng/l. Diazinon, EPTC and malathion were detected at much higher concentrations (940-3,830 ng/l) at the New and Alamo River upriver and near-shore stations. Concentrations of carbaryl, dacthal, diazinon, and EPTC were higher in the two fall sampling periods, whereas concentrations of atrazine, carbofuran, and trifluralin were higher during the spring, which matched seasonal use patterns of these pesticides. Current-use pesticides were also detected on suspended and bed sediments in concentrations ranging from detection limits to 106 ng/g. Chlorpyrifos, dacthal, EPTC, trifluralin, and DDE were the most frequently detected pesticides on sediments from all three rivers. The number of detections and concentrations of suspended sediment-associated pesticides were often similar for the river upriver and near-shore sites, consistent with downstream transport of pesticides via suspended sediment. While detectable suspended sediment pesticide concentrations were more sporadic than detected aqueous concentrations, seasonal trends were similar to those for dissolved concentrations. Generally, the pesticides detected on suspended sediments were the same as those on the bed sediments, and concentrations were similar, especially at the Alamo River upriver site. With a few exceptions, pesticides were not detected in suspended or bed sediments from the off-shore sites. The partitioning of pesticides between water and sediment was not predictable from solely the physical-chemical properties of individual pesticide compounds, but appear to be a complicated function of the quantity of pesticide applied in the watershed, residence time of sediments in the water, and compound solubility and hydrophobicity. Sediment concentrations of most pesticides were found to be 100-1,000 times lower than the low-effects levels determined in human health risk assessment studies. However, maximum concentrations of chlorpyrifos on suspended sediments were approximately half the low-effects level, suggesting the need for further sediment characterization of lake sediments proximate to riverine inputs.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2008	604						151	172		10.1007/s10750-008-9316-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9316-1													WOS:000254089000013

Cyanobacteria species dominance and diversity in three Australian drinking water reservoirs	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The objective of this study was to identify correlations between environmental variables and cyanobacterial diversity, succession and dominance in three Australian water supply reservoirs. We assessed up to 15 years of in-lake water quality monitoring data from Lake Wivenhoe and Lake Tingalpa (Queensland), and Lake Myponga (South Australia). Lakes Wivenhoe and Tingalpa, subject to a subtropical climate, had higher cyanobacterial richness than Lake Myponga in temperate South Australia. Richness in the subtropical lakes was positively correlated (P < 0.05) with total cyanobacteria biomass, and cyanobacteria biovolume > 0.03 mm(3)/l (Alert level 1; World Health Organization) was often composed of multiple cyanobacteria species. Peaks in total cyanobacteria biomass and diversity occurred in all three lakes from late spring to early autumn. Unicellular picocyanobacterial dominance was negatively correlated (P < 0.05) with total nitrogen while dominance of colonial and filamentous species with larger cells (e.g. Microcystis spp., Raphidiopsis spp., Dolichospermum circinale) was positively correlated (P < 0.05) with total phosphorus. Among the species with larger cells, diazotrophic D. circinale often dominated when total nitrogen was at low concentrations. Our results support decision making for selecting cyanoHAB control strategies based on single- or multi-species dominance and reinforce that new monitoring technologies could support species-level assessments.

The snowstorm of 13-14 January created a snowpack of recorded depth of up to 38 cm. The snowpack remained on the study site for 12 days in total and covered 46% of its area six days after the snowfall. It directly affected ground thermal regime as indicates temperature record at snow-covered profile AWS-JGM which subsurface section was nearly 5 degrees C colder compared to the snow-free AWS-CALM profile. The thermal insulation effect of snow cover is also reflected in the mean monthly (January) and summer (DJF) ground temperatures on AWS-JGM that decreased by ca 1.1 and 0.7 degrees C, respectively. Summer thawing degree days at a depth of 5 cm decreased by ca 10% and active layer was ca 5-10 cm thinner when compared to previous snow-free summer seasons. Surveying by ground penetrating radar revealed a general active layer thinning of up to 20% in those parts of the CALM-S which were covered by snow of >20 cm depth for at least six days.

Epipelic diatoms from an extreme acid environment: Beowulf Spring, Yellowstone National Park, USA	NOVA HEDWIGIA												A floristic study is presented of the diatom community from Beowulf Spring, Yellowstone National Park (YNP), U.S.A., a strongly acidic (pH<3) and thermophilous (temperature >50 degrees C) environment with potentially toxic concentrations of dissolved metals. A sampling transect between regions of active hydrous ferric oxide (HFO) precipitation and mats of periphytic red algae (Cyandiaceae) revealed that diatoms are present mainly in the regions of the spring characterized by the highest temperatures and brown arsenic-rich HFO mats. The diatom flora is dominated by a deme within the Nitzschia thermalis complex, in association with N. ovalis, Pinnularia acoricola, and Eunotia exigua. Abiotic silica precipitates were observed on the surfaces of most diatom cells in uncleaned material. Cells of Cyanidiaceae also participate in active silica deposition. These observations not only highlight the tolerance of hot-spring diatoms to extreme environments with respect to temperature, pH, and arsenic (As) concentration, but also illustrate the clear zonation between epipelic algal communities within a hot spring.																			0029-5035	2363-7188					2009				135			71	83																WOS:000264856800007

The Greenland ice-core record suggests the UK should have endured multiple changes, but the terrestrial palaeo-record lacks sufficient detail for confirmation from sites in the British Isles. Data from deposits at Finningley, South Yorkshire, can help redress this. A channel with organic silts, dated 40 314-39 552 cal a BP, contained plant macrofossil and insect remains showing tundra with dwarf-shrub heath and bare ground. Soil moisture conditions varied from free draining to riparian, with ponds and wetter vegetated areas. The climate was probably low arctic with snow cover during the winter. Mutual climatic range (MCR), based on Coleoptera, shows the mean monthly winter temperatures of -22 to -2 degrees C and summer ones of 8-14 degrees C. Periglacial structures within the basal gravel deposits and beyond the glacial limits indicate cold-climate conditions, including permafrost. A compilation of MCR reconstructions for other Middle Devensian English sites shows that marine isotope stage 3-between 59 and 28 ka-experienced substantial variation in climate consistent with the Greenland ice-core record. The exact correlation is hampered by temporal resolution, but the Finningley site stadial at approximately 40 ka may correlate with the one of the Greenland stadials 7-11.					; Chase, Brian/A-1202-2010; Bennike, Ole/G-7070-2018; Buckland, Philip/GYI-8823-2022	Murton, Della/0000-0003-1968-6383; Chase, Brian/0000-0001-6987-1291; Buckland, Philip/0000-0002-2430-0839; Bennike, Ole/0000-0002-5486-9946; Frederick, Charles/0000-0002-5955-2411; PANAGIOTAKOPULU, EVA/0000-0002-3523-7775; bateman, mark/0000-0003-1756-6046													2054-5703					JUL 26	2019	6	7							190577	10.1098/rsos.190577	http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.190577								31417753					WOS:000479146300070
J	Noges, P; Noges, T				Noges, Peeter; Noges, Tiina			Weak trends in ice phenology of Estonian large lakes despite significant warming trends	HYDROBIOLOGIA					3rd European Large Lakes Symposium	SEP, 2012	Lake Constance, GERMANY					We studied changes in air temperature (AT) in Tartu, Estonia, since 1866; ice phenology in two Estonian large lakes since the 1920s; and daily surface water temperatures (SWT) in these lakes since the 1940s. The Mann-Kendall test showed increasing AT trends in all seasons with biggest changes in spring. The strongest increase in SWT occurred in April and August. The temperature increase has accelerated since 1961. Despite significant trends in the seasonal AT and SWT of Estonian large lakes, trends in ice phenology were weak or absent, implying that the processes governing ice phenology are more complex than those governing lake SWT. Greater snowfall was associated with later ice breakup, longer duration of ice cover, and greater ice thickness, while the relationship between winter rainfall and these ice parameters was the opposite. In the deeper Lake Peipsi, ice-on occurred later and ice-off earlier than in the shallower Vrtsjarv. The dates of both ice-on and ice-off responded more sensitively to AT in the case of Peipsi than in the case of Vrtsjarv. An increase of the average November-March AT by 2A degrees C would presumably halve the ice cover duration in Peipsi but shorten it only by about 20% in Vrtsjarv.

J	Paragamian, VL; Kruse, G				Paragamian, VL; Kruse, G			Kootenai River white sturgeon spawning migration Behavior and a predictive model	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Each autumn and spring, adult white sturgeon Acipenser transmontanus migrate from the lower Kootenai River and Kootenay Lake, British Columbia, to prespawn staging reaches in Idaho. In spring, they migrate further upriver to a spawning reach near Bonners Ferry, Idaho. We monitored movement and behavior of 49 reproductively mature white sturgeon with radio and sonic telemetry from 1991 through 1997. White sturgeon responded to mitigated flows from 1994 through 1997, migrating substantial distances to a spawning reach soon after the onset of local runoff and rising water temperatures. Males migrated at temperatures of 5.5-12.1degreesC, 2 weeks before spawning; females followed about a week later, at slightly warmer temperatures. Females stayed in the spawning reach 1-28 d, averaging 10.5 d. Males spent 7 d to 2 months in the spawning reach, averaging 30 d. After spawning, 63% of the females moved immediately to Kootenay Lake; the remainder spent a longer time in the river downstream of the spawning reach. Some (52%) males remained in the river, and the remainder migrated to Kootenay Lake. Female behavior and migration was more attuned to environmental conditions than was male behavior. Several environmental variables were examined to determine their effect on female white sturgeon migration to the spawning reach. Changes in temperature and river stage were the best predictors of the probability that females would migrate to the spawning reach. A logistic regression model, when applied to a subset of our original observations, correctly predicted movement to the spawning area 93% of the time. Our model can be used as a tool for risk assessment of white sturgeon spawning migration during various snow pack or temperature forecasts. It will be helpful in determining approximate migration or spawning times, making water management decisions, and assessing effects of temperature fluctuations. The model will be useful to continued study of white sturgeon by predicting spawning migration and improving efficiency in deploying sampling gear.																			0275-5947					FEB	2001	21	1					10	21		10.1577/1548-8675(2001)021<0010:KRWSSM>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8675(2001)021<0010:KRWSSM>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000174289000002

The Secondary Water Quality Standards (NSCA) adopted in Chile have incorporated the use of bioindicators complementary to physicochemical analyses, in order to determine the ecological condition of lotic and lentic environments. Our research used the "Lake Biotic Index" (LBI) to establish the ecological condition of Lake Rupanco using benthic macroinvertebrates. The results indicated an Oligo-Eubiotic condition for this lake given the high concentration of oxygen and low organic matter content in sediments, in addition to low biogenic potential and good taxa preservation in both the autumn and spring surveys. Features of the ecological condition obtained through the application of the LBI (benthic subsystem) conform to the results of physicochemical and microalgae analyses undertaken previously in Lake Rupanco (pelagic subsystem). Based on these results, we support application of the LBI index as a complementary tool for the integrated management of lentic ecosystems.

Comparative studies of phytoplankton compositions as a response of water quality at North El-Manzala Lake, Egypt	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												El-Manzala Lake represents one of the most economical and valuable fish sources lakes in Egypt.

Phytoplankton standing crop in North El-Manzala Lake-Damietta, Egypt, was varied in relation with water quality as follows: Al-Baghdadi > El Nafft > Shatt Greba > Shatta > El-Deiba > Towall Ibrahim > Abo El-Ross. Cyanophyta was the dominant class at all sites except at Al-Baghdadi and Towall Ibrahim where Bacillariophyta and Pyrrophyta were the predominant phytoplanktonic groups, respectively. The maximum crop density was recorded in winter, whereas the lowest values occurred in summer. Pearson's correlation coefficient revealed that most of the phytoplankton groups were significantly correlated with water temperature, pH, total alkalinity, ammonia, nitrate, silica, and ortho-phosphorus.

Sampling was conducted in 5 transects along the south coastline of the Caspian Sea and sediment grain size, hydrogen sulfide, Oxidation-reduction potential (Eh), total nitrogen, nitrite, nitrate, ammonium, total phosphorus, organic and inorganic phosphorous were measured. Eh values showed significant differences between seasons and between different transects ( p < 0.05). Hydrogen sulfide ranged from 1.87 to 307.00 ppm. No significant difference was observed in hydrogen sulfide between seasons and among depths ( p > 0.05) . Total, inorganic and organic phosphorus contents were 782.96 - 1335.79 ppm, 639.66 - 1183.60 ppm, and 42.58 - 205.46 ppm, respectively. Total nitrogen revealed significant differences among transects ( p < 0.05). Based on sediment quality guidelines, most sampling sites had alerting conditions for organic matter, and phosphorous contamination was detected at all stations. Anoxic condition was seen at most sites according to sedimentary Eh.

Yet, most studies have focused only on annual maximum floods (AMFs), their climatology, and the associated impacts. Given that monthly/seasonal floods also cause significant damage and disruptions to daily life, this study may be the first to explore winter flood hydroclimatology, a predominantly a non-AMF season, and its associated large-scale climate drivers over the Coterminous US (CONUS). Using a mixed-effects model, we find that the influence of various hydroclimate predictors on winter floods is largely consistent within subregions. Antecedent land-surface conditions are crucial for winter floods in inland areas, while the Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) significantly affects coastal watersheds. The Atlantic SSTs impact winter floods in the south and northeast, while atmospheric conditions influence the Midwest and California. Additional analysis reveals that damage from winter floods is more widespread compared to AMFs across the nation, affecting the entire eastern seaboard, Southwest US, and over the Great Lakes region. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of floods across all seasons (non-AMFs) is critical for developing effective mitigation measures, as it provides information on impacts and required compensation for smaller return period floods.

The identification of top litter items discarded in the environment is essential to prioritize environmental policies to prevent plastic leakage and promote a circular economy. Here, we present the first quantification of macrolitter on three sites along Durance riverbank and one site on Lake Serre-Pon & ccedil;on's beach, in the R & eacute;gion SUD-Provence-Alpes-C & ocirc;te d'Azur, southeastern France. Data were collected through citizen science between 2019 and 2020 in three sampling occasions (autumn, winter, spring) on Durance riverbank and in 22 occasions on Lake Serre-Pon & ccedil;on. A total of 25'423 litter items were categorized, of which 82% were plastics. Single-use plastic items correspond to 8.13% of total, while single-use plastic bottles are among the top 10 litter items at each site. Median litter abundance across all samples is 2,081 items/100 m survey, two orders of magnitude higher than European precautionary threshold value for marine litter (20 items/100 m survey). The majority of items (74.83%) were small and non-identifiable. Pieces of polystyrene, soft plastics and rigid plastics represented the majority of litter items in total (56.63%) and at S1 (89.28%), S2 (58.95%) and S3 (79.60%). Glass pieces corresponded to 15.83% of total litter items. Soft plastic pieces are the most abundant litter category overall and correspond to 58.85% of litter items at sampling site along Durance riverbank located in an agricultural zone, suggesting their source from agricultural plastic mulch films. Among the identifiable items, the most abundant were plastic biomedia used in waste water treatment plants and single-use beverage bottles in plastic and in glass. The development of extended producer responsibility schemes for plastic mulch films and plastic biomedia and of deposit return schemes for single-use beverage bottles is suggested as a way to prevent leakage in the environment. This work confirms the opportunity to use citizen science to gather relevant data on macrolitter items and to monitor the effectiveness of environmental regulations to reduce plastic pollution.

Seasonal habitat-use differences among Lake Erie's walleye stocks	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Understanding the spatial ecology and habitat-use of Lake Erie's commercially important walleye (Sander vitreus) population is imperative due to their large-scale seasonal migrations (>400 km) exposing them to five different jurisdictions in the USA and Canada. The objective of this study was to determine the habitat selected by walleye throughout the year and across Lake Erie. Here, we used acoustic telemetry to estimate walleye occurrence at three lake depth categories that were pertinent to biology (e.g., spawning) and management (e.g., quota allocation). Detection data from 851 adults during five continuous years identified consistent seasonal fluctuations in habitat selection across western (WB) and eastern (EB) basin walleye stocks. Sex-specific differences were also found during spawning periods (March-May) when males showed a stronger affinity to shallow waters <6 m than females. Also, EB stocks selected these shallow waters longer than WB stocks, likely due to differences in thermal patterns between basins. Deep water (>13 m) was readily selected between spring and winter (>6 months/year) for most WB and EB walleye despite stock-specific migration patterns. This study provides novel information about the space use patterns of one of the most economically important fish in North America at spatial and temporal scales relevant to management.

Tetracycline resistance of Escherichia coli isolated from water, human stool, and fish gills from the Lake Sevan basin	LETTERS IN APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY												The ecological state of Lake Sevan, the largest drinking water reservoir for the South Caucasus, formed under the influence of climatic and social changes. This study assesses the bacteriological quality of water in the rivers of the Lake Sevan basin and tetracycline-resistant bacteria isolated from fish and people living near the rivers of the Lake Sevan basin in Armenia in autumn 2019 and spring 2020. No differences have been shown for the tetracycline resistance of the investigated E. coli isolated from the human gut and the Masrik, Argichi, and Gavaraget Rivers. Horizontal gel electrophoresis revealed the same plasmid bands in most of the investigated E. coli with the same tetracycline resistance from the different sources of the Argichi River (obtained from people/fish/water sources where the fish were caught). The results also showed that most of the waters carried Edwardsiella spp., Erwinia spp., Morganella spp., and Proteus spp. in addition to E. coli; the coliform index did not exceed the standard level of 5 x 104 CFU mL-1 there. These findings highlight the importance of multidisciplinary studies of bacteria from "interacting" ecosystems, which might serve as a basis for the suggestion of microbial antibiotic resistance as another indicator of water pollution.

In Taihu Lake, as a typical representative of freshwater system in China, the ARGs occurrence and abundance was of great importance for ecological risk control and public health protection. In this research, high-throughput sequencing and metagenomics technique were used to investigate the seasonal ARGs profile in overlying water and sediment at typical area of Taihu Lake. Besides, taxonomy pattern of ARGs host bacteria and potential pathogens were identified. The results showed that 33 ARG subtypes and 11 ARG types were detected in research area, among which bacitracin, multidrug and sulfonamides resistance gene were with the highest abundance. The relative abundance of ARGs in overlying water and sediment ranged from 1.68 to 661.05 ppm and from 1.93 to 49.47 ppm, respectively. ARG host (18 bacteria genus) were identified and annotated, among which Clostridium botulinum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumonia were pathogenic bacteria. The pathogens were mostly detected at Xukou Bay in spring and fall, which might be caused by the inlet water from aquaculture area of Yangcheng Lake. Pseudomonas was the most abundant ARGs host (ant2ib, baca, bl2d_oxa2,mexb, mexf, mexw and oprn), which may facilitate the propagation of ARGs in freshwater system.

GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY												Male Largemouth Bass were sampled from two locations in Lake Mead (USA), a site influenced by treated municipal wastewater effluent and urban runoff (Las Vegas Bay), and a reference site (Overton Arm). Samples were collected in summer (July '07) and spring (March '08) to assess general health, endocrine and reproductive biomarkers, and compare contaminant body burdens by analyzing 252 organic chemicals. Sperm count and motility were measured in spring. Contaminants were detected at much higher frequencies and concentrations in fish from Las Vegas Bay than Overton Arm. Those with the highest concentrations included PCBs, DDTs, PBDEs, galaxolide, and methyl triclosan. Fish from Las Vegas Bay also had higher Fulton condition factor, hepatosomatic index, and hematocrit, and lower plasma 11-ketotestosterone concentration (KT). Gonadosomatic index (GSI) and sperm motility did not differ between sites, but sperm count was lower by nearly 50% in fish from Las Vegas Bay. A positive association between KT and GSI was identified, but this association was nonlinear. On average, maximal GSI was reached at sub-maximal KT concentrations. In conclusion, the higher concentration of contaminant body burdens coupled with reduced levels of KT and sperm count in fish from Las Vegas Bay suggest that male reproductive condition was influenced by contaminant exposures. Also, the nonlinear KT-GSI association provided a framework to understand why GSI was similar between male bass from both sites despite their large difference in KT, and also suggested the existence of post-gonadal growth functions of KT at high concentrations.

Limnochemistry and nutrient dynamics in Upper Lake, Bhopal, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												In limnetic ecosystem, water quality depends upon physical, chemical, and biological factors. Effects of temperature, light scattering, and absorption by suspended and dissolved matter, transport, and mixing of nutrients within the lake are the significant factors as far as water quality is concerned. Nutrient loading into the lake and internal cycling of nutrients is always a matter of concern and critical to number of processes. During the winter season, heat and momentum transfer at the lake surface and the temperature-density relation of water destabilize the water column and drive vertical mixing and transport processes. The deepening of the surface layer produces nutrient transfer from the hypolimnion into the euphotic zone of epilimnion. It may also resuspend sediments that would have settled under stratified conditions, or redistribute particles that may still be in suspension. Thus, there exists a complex connection between the hydrodynamics and water quality issues. Present study is an effort to understand how seasonal changes in the limnetic ecosystem regulate the limnochemistry and movement of nutrient. The study revealed that significant variations of nutrients and organic load were observed between epilimnion and hypolimnion during summer season, and the lake was found in hyper-eutrophic condition throughout the study period.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				NOV	2012	184	11					7065	7077		10.1007/s10661-011-2480-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-011-2480-1								22203413					WOS:000309476100046

Year-class variation drives interactions between warm-water predators and yellow perch	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Walleye (Sander vitreus), smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) are common top predators across many north temperate lakes, but no previous analyses have assessed factors driving their combined impact on mortality of a shared prey, yellow perch (Perca flavescens). We estimated consumption dynamics of walleye, smallmouth bass, and largemouth bass during 3 years that differed in age-0 yellow perch year-class strength and evaluated the relative contribution of each predator to age-0 yellow perch mortality, in Oneida Lake, New York, USA. Habitat-specific diet composition and population densities were integrated with temperature and growth rates to parameterize a bioenergetics model and estimate annual consumption of major diet items. Walleye were the dominant predator in both offshore and inshore habitats, while smallmouth bass and largemouth bass were also important inshore predators. Consumption of age-0 yellow perch by all three predators was positively correlated to age-0 yellow perch year-class strength, but our ability to account for age-0 yellow perch mortality decreased during years when year-class strength was strong. Within each year, predation by the three species accounted for all observed age-0 yellow perch mortality in late summer and fall, but not in the early summer, suggesting other predators in the lake likely predate on the youngest, most vulnerable yellow perch. These results are important for understanding how diverse predator communities can alter the spatial and temporal availability of prey refuges and influence mortality of a shared prey.

The genetic component of th is variation was assessed by an allozyme and morphological reanalysis of nine previously studied sites. Genetic associations with morphological variation were found, but all were attributed to D. galeata mendotae x Daphnia rosea hybridization or to taxonomic confusion with D. rosea. The existence of hybrids accounted for spatial polymorphism both within and among lakes. In addition, hybrids contributed to seasonal variation as they increased in abundance from summer to winter. Nevertheless, cyclomorphosis in D. galeata mendotae s.s was real and due largely to phenotypic plasticity. Local hybridization between D. galeata mendotae and D. rosea was widespread from the midwestern states to Vermont. The distributions and habitat associations of D. galeata mendotae and D. rosea indicated that ecological segregation at the lake level acts as an important reproductive isolating mechanism. Reinterpretation of previous studies, however, suggests that disturbance followed by one or a few hybridization events often leads to hybrid domination of a lake.

At mid-altitudes, changes in winter precipitation will have immediate effects on lake functioning. Lake Tovel (1178 m a.s.l.), a deep (39 m) aquifer-fed lake in the Brenta Dolomites (Italy), showed unusually high water temperatures in 2017. As evidenced by a principal component analysis, monthly data from 2000 to 2016, including the hot European year 2003 and the locally warmest year 2015, did not show comparably high water temperatures. Volume-weighted mean water temperature from June to September 2017 was 1.3-2.1 degrees C higher than long-term temperatures (mean 2000-2016: 6.6-8.8 degrees C). Warmer air temperatures in December 2016 and February and March 2017 led to a shift in winter precipitation from snow to mostly rain. The consequent lack of a spring snowmelt event resulted in whole-lake warming and increased stability of the water column, as evidenced by volume-weighted mean water temperature and Schmidt stability. Stable isotopes were used as tracers for the origin of lake water. The yearly mean delta O-18 of lake water in 2017 was more enriched (-10.9 parts per thousand) with respect to the long-term mean (2009-2016: -11.9 parts per thousand), supporting a pluvial instead of a nival origin in 2017. The temporary warming of Lake Tovel is an early sign of future changes in mountain hydrology, and we advocate for increasing attention to lake catchments considering their impact on many ecosystem services.

Assessment of the Vegetation Condition of Lakes and Springs of the West Kazakhstan Region	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												The vegetation of 5 lakes and 40 springs of Western Kazakhstan is considered. The relationship between the degree of mineralization and the composition of vegetation is revealed. The anthropogenic factor influences the vegetation of lakes and springs by increasing the number of ruderal and halophytic plants. With a decrease in the water level in lakes, processes of active salinization of the water area and the coastal part are observed, one indicator of which is vegetation. In the territories adjacent to the springs, the dominant role of mesotrophs and megatrophs in the structure of the flora of the springs is noted, which indicates the predominance of soils and ground with sufficient and excessive content of nutrients in the studied area.

The diets of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) parr, brown trout (S. trutta) parr, and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) parr were significantly different in February but not in March. Salmonid diets differed from the benthos and the drift during both months. Dipterans (chironomids, simuliids, and tipulids) and ephemerellids were the major prey taxa consumed. All three species fed more heavily on prey items from the benthos than from the drift. The diet of Atlantic salmon had the highest similarity to the benthos whereas the diet of brown trout had the lowest similarity to the drift. All three salmonid species generally selected ephemerellids, limnephilids, and chironomids and avoided elmids. These winter feeding observations are the first reported for this specific salmonid assemblage and will help managers better understand interspecific associations during this critical period.																			0175-8659	1439-0426				DEC	2017	33	6					1158	1165		10.1111/jai.13488	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jai.13488													WOS:000414939700011
J	Yang, Y; Colom, W; Pierson, D; Pettersson, K				Yang, Yang; Colom, William; Pierson, Don; Pettersson, Kurt			Water column stability and summer phytoplankton dynamics in a temperate lake (Lake Erken, Sweden)	INLAND WATERS												Phytoplankton development in aquatic ecosystems is caused by interactions among multiple environmental factors. Physical processes, particularly development of thermal stratification, have been proposed to be important factors for regulating phytoplankton composition and abundance during summer. This study examined the temporal pattern of thermal stratification during summer in Lake Erken, Sweden, based on 21 years of historical data spanning 23 years and investigated the role played by water stability on phytoplankton development. Water column stability indexes were calculated from high frequency measurements during periods of summer thermal stratification. Clustering and ordination analyzed the dissimilarities between communities during different periods and extracted the significant environmental gradients controlling phytoplankton succession. Wind introduced the major external disturbance to Lake Erken during summer and played an important role for the progression of thermocline depth. Species-specific thermal stability preference or tolerance determined the response of individual species to the stratification and constitutes a mechanism of species selection in phytoplankton dynamics. Lake Erken is an unstably stratified lake during summer, caused by wind-induced turbulence and internal seiches. Adaptation to these unstable conditions is the major determinant of phytoplankton dynamics. Hydrodynamic variability, characterized by different stability indexes in early, mid, and late summer, was the key factor regulating phytoplankton dynamics, directly by changing phytoplankton distribution and indirectly by altering both the light and nutrient availability in the epilimnion.					; Montero, William/ABG-7984-2020	Colom Montero, William/0000-0002-2035-2498; 													2044-2041	2044-205X					2016	6	4					499	508		10.5268/IW-6.4.874	http://dx.doi.org/10.5268/IW-6.4.874													WOS:000388608700003
J	NILSSEN, JP				NILSSEN, JP			ACIDIFICATION OF A SMALL WATERSHED IN SOUTHERN-NORWAY AND SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF ACIDIC AQUATIC ENVIRONMENTS	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												Continuous monitoring of a small watershed in southern Norway shows that the pH has decreased significantly by almost half a unit (from 5.9 to 5.4) and conductivity increased from 23-29 .mu.S/cm within the period from 1965-1975. Changes also are detected in sediment analyses where Daphnia and Chaoborus are only found deeper than 3-4 cm. Forest clear-cutting activities have probably accelerated the acidification processes of the already highly vulnerable freshwater localities. The acidic lakes show a solute content below 0.4 meq/l and the bicarbonate buffer system may no longer work efficiently. Spring thaw and autumn rain episodes are accompanied by strong alternations in the chemical environment of the lakes: a considerable drop in pH and an increasing conductivity and sulfate content. With increasing acidification the planktonic community changes from a system governed by fish predation (brown trout and Eurasian perch as dominant species) to an invertebrate predation with Heterocope and pelagic corixids. Pelagic zooplankton are primarily composed of littoral species: Bosmina longispina, Diaphanosoma brachyurum, Eudiaptomus gracilis and H. saliens. The littoral plant and invertebrate communities are described and discussed.																			0020-9309						1980	65	2					177	207		10.1002/iroh.19800650202	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19800650202													WOS:A1980KD54700001

From 2005 to 2010, extensive glacier snow sampling campaigns were carried out in 14 snowpits from 9 glaciers over western China, and the vertical distribution profiles of Hg were obtained. The Total Hg (THg) concentrations in the glacier snow ranged from <1 to 43.6 ng L-1, and exhibited clear seasonal variations with lower values in summer than in winter. Spatially, higher THg concentrations were typically observed in glacier snows from the northern region where atmospheric particulate loading is comparably high. Glacier snowpit Hg was largely dependent on particulate matters and was associated with particulate Hg, which is less prone to postdepositional changes, thus providing a valuable record of atmospheric Ng deposition. Estimated atmospheric Hg depositional fluxes ranged from 0.74 to 7.89 mu g m(-2) yr(-1), agreeing very well with the global natural values, but are one to two orders of magnitude lower than that of the neighboring East Asia. Elevated Hg concentrations were observed in refrozen ice layers in several snowpits subjected to intense melt, indicating that Hg can be potentially released to meltwater.					丛, 志远/E-5237-2012; Xu, Jianzhong/L-6216-2013; Kang, Shichang/I-6830-2018; Wang, Feiyue/E-4147-2012; Huang, Jie/GWQ-5005-2022	li, chao liu/0000-0003-2092-2435; Xu, Jianzhong/0000-0002-9933-1744; Kang, Shichang/0000-0003-2115-9005; Wang, Feiyue/0000-0001-5297-0859; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				MAY 15	2012	46	10					5404	5413		10.1021/es300166x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es300166x								22519575					WOS:000303964700022
J	Feng, L; Wang, HS; Yan, Y				Feng Lan; Wang Haisen; Yan Yan			Spatial-Temporal Variations of Water Quality in Urban Rivers after Small Sluices Construction: A Case in Typical Regions of the Taihu Lake Basin	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												Urban river pollution is considered a 'necessary evil' consequence of disproportionate developmental expansion in metropolises. Unprecedented expansion and anthropic activities lead to the deterioration of urban rivers with municipal and industrial sewage. The construction of sluices is one of the irrefutable parts of the process. In order to prevent floods and drought, many cities build sluices and dams in rivers to balance water quantity in different seasons. To explore the change characteristics of the water quality in urban rivers after the construction of sluices and dams, the change in the total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations upstream and downstream of rivers was investigated under the condition of sluices closure in Wuxi. According to the results, when the sluices were closed, the pollutants of TP and TN would accumulate upstream in rivers, which caused the water quality in the upper reaches to be worse than that in the lower reaches. Specifically, the TN and TP concentrations downstream of urban rivers in Wuxi were approximately 14.42% and 13.80% lower than those upstream when the sluices were closed. Additionally, the water quality in urban rivers was usually better in summer and autumn than in the other seasons, showing obvious seasonality after the construction of the sluices. The research will provide a theoretical basis for future sluice operation and the water resources management of urban rivers.																				1660-4601				OCT	2022	19	19							12453	10.3390/ijerph191912453	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912453								36231753					WOS:000866789900001
J	Ochs, CA; Rhew, K				Ochs, CA; Rhew, K			Population dynamics of autotrophic picoplankton in a southeastern US reservoir	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												Reservoirs typically exhibit a gradient along their longitudinal axis in turbidity, nutrient flux, and algal biomass. We utilized these characteristics to examine factors influencing temporal and spatial patterns in abundance, biomass, composition, and production of epilimnetic autotrophic picoplankton (APP) in Sardis Reservoir, Mississippi, USA. Over a 18-month period, APP abundance varied between about 15,000 and 700,000 cells ml(-1). Both APP abundance and APP biomass were closely linked to APP production and temperature. On an annual basis, the contribution of APP to total algal biomass and light-standardized production ranged between 15-47%, and 5-40%, respectively. Prokaryotes comprised more than 95% of all APP in summer, but eukaryotes dominated the APP community in winter. During the nutrient-depleted summer period, APP decreased in number but tended to increase in the percentage of total algal biomass and production, from the uplake riverine zone to the downlake lacustrine zone. Only in the second year of the study, when reservoir water residence time was more than four times greater than in the first year, were there significant differences in biomass and productivity of APP between the uplake and downlake regions. We suggest that, particularly in years or at times of the year when water-flow through the reservoir is slow, the importance of APP in Sardis Reservoir reflects a spatial and temporal gradient in nutrient availability.																			0020-9309						1997	82	3					293	313		10.1002/iroh.19970820302	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19970820302													WOS:A1997YC64000001
J	Cavaliere, E; Baulch, HM				Cavaliere, Emily; Baulch, Helen M.			Winter nitrification in ice-covered lakes	PLOS ONE												With changes in ice cover duration, nutrient loading, and anoxia risk, it is important to understand the mechanisms that control nitrogen cycling and oxygen depletion in lakes through winter. Current understanding is largely limited to description of changes in chemistry, with few measurements of the processes driving winter changes, how they differ across lakes, and how they are impacted by under-ice conditions. Nitrification is a process which consumes oxygen and ammonium (NH4+), and supplies nitrate (NO3-). To date, nitrification has been measured under ice cover in only two lakes globally. Here, we used (NH4+)-N-15 enrichment to measure rates of pelagic nitrification in thirteen water bodies in two ecozones. Our work demonstrates ecologically important rates of nitrification can occur despite low water temperatures, impacting NH4+, NO3- and, most importantly, oxygen concentrations. However, high rates are not the norm. When, where and why is nitrification important in winter? We found that nitrification rates were highest in a eutrophic lake chain downstream of a wastewater treatment effluent (mean: 226.5 mu g N L-1 d(-1)), and in a semi-saline prairie lake (110.0 mu g N L-1 d(-1)). In the boreal shield, a eutrophic lake had nitrification rates exceeding those of an oligotrophic lake by 6-fold. Supplementing our results with literature data we found NH4+ concentrations were the strongest predictor of nitrification rates across lentic ecosystems in winter. Higher nitrification rates were associated with higher concentrations of NH4+, NO3- and nitrous oxide (N2O). While more work is required to understand the switch between high and low nitrification rates and strengthen our understanding of winter nitrogen cycling, this work demonstrates that high nitrification rates can occur in winter.

Unusually Large Wintering Flock of Common Loons Foraging in the Gulf of Mexico	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST												Gavia burner (Common Loon) utilizes freshwater lakes for nesting and breeding, but winters off both US coasts and the Gulf of Mexico in marine habitats. They are primarily piscivorous. In the winter, Common Loons feed predominately as single individuals, but they' occasionally form small groups or flocks. The groups likely facilitate greater feeding efficiency. The largest previously reported foraging aggregation of wintering Common Loons was approximately 200 individuals. We report an extremely large wintering flock of >600 loons foraging 17 km from the southern coast of Mississippi.

J	Oroud, IM				Oroud, IM			Diurnal evaporation from fresh and hypersaline shallow ponds in a hot, dry environment	PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												A numerical procedure is developed to evaluate the diurnal trend of evaporation from a shallow freshwater pond and a hypersaline pond, both of which are 2 m deep and encountering identical meteorological forcings. Evaporation from both water bodies is calculated using Penman-Brutsaert formulation in which atmospheric buoyancy is calculated based on the semi-empirical theory of Monin-Obukhov formulation. A new iterative procedure is presented in this paper to solve for the water temperature. The present model attains a rapid convergence and compares favorably with temperature and evaporation observations obtained for a hypersaline pond and deep sunken pans. Calculations show that the average daily evaporation rates from the hypersaline pond during January and July are 0.5 and 6.4 mm day(-1). Corresponding values for the freshwater pond are 2.4 and 10.45 mm day(-1), respectively. Salinity suppresses evaporation strongly during winter because of its coupling effect!; on net radiation and saturation vapor pressure. During summer, energy availability accounts for 74%, and 64% of total diurnal evaporation from the hypersaline pond and freshwater, respectively. In winter, however, the aerodynamic term accounts for about 80% of evaporation from both water bodies. Heat storage/release within the underlying sediments appeals to be negligibly small and may be neglected with very little loss of accuracy when formulating the energy balance of shallow lakes.																			0272-3646					JUL-AUG	1997	18	4					363	382		10.1080/02723646.1997.10642625	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02723646.1997.10642625													WOS:000073268700005
J	Pimentel, S; Flowers, GE				Pimentel, Sam; Flowers, Gwenn E.			A numerical study of hydrologically driven glacier dynamics and subglacial flooding	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES												A hydrologically coupled flowband model of 'higher order' ice dynamics is used to explore perturbations in response to supraglacial water drainage and subglacial flooding. The subglacial drainage system includes interacting 'fast' and 'slow' drainage elements. The fast drainage system is assumed to be composed of ice-walled conduits and the slow system of a macroporous water sheet. Under high subglacial water pressures, flexure of the overlying ice is modelled using elastic beam theory. A regularized Coulomb friction law describes basal boundary conditions that enable hydrologically driven acceleration. We demonstrate the modelled interactions between hydrology and ice dynamics by means of three observationally inspired examples: (i) simulations of meltwater drainage at an Alpine-type glacier produce seasonal and diurnal variability, and exhibit drainage evolution characteristic of the so-called 'spring transition'; (ii) horizontal and vertical diurnal accelerations are modelled in response to summer meltwater input at a Greenland-type outlet glacier; and (iii) short-lived perturbations to basal water pressure and ice-flow speed are modelled in response to the prescribed drainage of a supraglacial lake. Our model supports the suggestion that a channelized drainage system can form beneath the margins of the Greenland ice sheet, and may contribute to reducing the dynamic impact of floods derived from supraglacial lakes.

However, Shelduck's patterns of habitat use in these protected wetlands during the wintering season are still hindered by lack of information in arid and semi-arid regions regarding population dynamics and the effects of climate variables. This ornithological survey aims to study population dynamics and temporal patterns of diurnal activities of the Shelduck at two Ramsar and Important Bird Area sites (Chott Tinsilt and Sebkhet Ezzemoul) with respect to the effect of climatic parameters of the habitat in order to deepen our understanding of wintering strategies and habitat use. Populations were weekly censused from 06:00 to 19:00 during the entire wintering season (September 2015-May 2016). Diurnal behavioural activities were monitored at the same rate, and then the variation of time budget was tested using generalized linear model to determine the effects of climate variables and conspecific density dependence. The Shelduck was observed at both sites from the end of November and remained there until the total desiccation of both lakes in early May. Trends of Shelduck's population dynamics differed between the two sites. Generalized linear models revealed the significant effects of temperature, wind speed and number of snowy days on population dynamics. Feeding was the main diurnal activity of the Shelduck at both sites with 80.2% of time budget at Chott Tinsilt (mainly feeding at lake shores) and 82% at Sebkhet Ezzemoul (mainly feeding in water). The generalized linear models showed that the variation of time budget allocated to different diurnal activities was not density-dependent, but rather it was negatively affected by the increase of air temperature. Significant effects of the interaction between population size and some climatic variables were found and discussed. During the whole wintering season, Chott Tinsilt and Sebkhet Ezzemoul play an important ecological role since they offer a wide-ranging diurnal forging habitat and a shelter for thousands of this waterfowl.					; Moussa, Houhamdi/J-2708-2018; Chenchouni, Haroun/I-7494-2012	BEZZALLA, ADEL/0000-0001-6311-8047; 													1758-1559	1758-1567				AUG	2019	12	3					77	95		10.1177/1758155919835122	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1758155919835122													WOS:000482727000001

The water level of this spring has continuously declined in recent decades, causing both the government and many scholars great concern. To better understand its hydrologic structure, this study investigated the origin of the spring and its recharge sources based on the hydrochemical and isotopic (O-1(8), H-2 and H-3) composition of 56 water samples collected along the groundwater flow path. The results indicate the spring is a window into the groundwater table cut out of low-lying terrain in sand dunes, with the geographic and sedimentary conditions affecting its genesis and hydrochemistry. The spring and shallow sedimentary aquifers are recharged primarily by river water, while deep bedrock aquifers are recharged by deep lateral groundwater flow via fault zones in the piedmont of the Qilian Mountains. The results of recharge altitude calculations demonstrate a possible groundwater supply from deep bedrock aquifers to the south of spring. The recorded environmental H-3 content varied from 11 to 40 T.U., indicating the groundwater is primarily recharged by glacier meltwater from modern precipitation, with only a small fraction from pre-modern times. End-member analysis using Cl- and delta O-1(8) shows recharge ratios of influent water from the Dang River and deep groundwater represent about 43 and 22% of the lake water, respectively, with artificial recharge accounting for the remaining 35%. Regional hydrogeological conditions, arid climate, and sand deposition have negative influences on the maintenance of lake water levels, but observed regional groundwater level declines resulting from the construction of the Dang River Reservoir, seepage from drainage canals, and excessive exploitation of groundwater are the most important factors contributing to the ecological crisis in the study area. These results provide insights into the origin and recharge sources of the Crescent Moon Spring that will guide efforts to preserve the water level.

After 2 years of monitoring in shallow areas of a floodplain lake from the lower Parana basin (Argentina), it was evidenced that water temperature modulated gonadal maturation, but it was the river water level the synchronising stimulus that triggered spawning. This species exhibited a single annual breeding period from October to January, with most spawning activity in November. According to the von Bertalanffy growth curve, fish would reach autumn to winter months with L-S of similar to 120 mm, already mature males. The first mature females were found at L-S of 210 mm, becoming sexually mature between the second and third breeding seasons. This is the first integrative study that includes the body-length frequency distribution and sex differential size at first maturity and growth, and reports the presence of intersex gonads questioning its sexual pattern from gonochoristic to sequential hermaphrodite species. The sexual pattern, the multiple spawning behaviour and a medium to high absolute fecundity support the opportunistic and invasive behavior observed in previous contributions for this characiform species.					; Llamazares Vegh, Sabina/HMP-7156-2023; Lozano, Ismael/JRW-2665-2023; Piazza, Yanina/KLY-7916-2024; NOSTRO, FABIANA/G-4068-2013	Lo Nostro, Fabiana/0000-0001-8816-9449; Lozano, Ismael/0000-0003-0396-5433; Piazza, Yanina Grisel/0000-0003-4006-1169													0022-1112	1095-8649				APR	2023	102	4					977	991		10.1111/jfb.15338	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.15338		FEB 2023						36744697					WOS:000940374300001

We sampled Berula erecta (Huds.) and Callitriche obtusangula (Le Gall.) from 17 oligosaprobic hardwater streams in the Alsatian Rhine floodplain of northeastern France. Sampling was conducted on a monthly basis during a 9-month period from August 1996 to April 1997. For B. erecta, phosphorus content of shoots and roots were correlated to water phosphorus content but not to sediment phosphorus content. The range of phosphorus shoot content of C. obtusangula was similar to that of B. erecta. Phosphorus shoot content of C. obtusangula was not correlated with water and sediment phosphorus content. In one stream where both species were present on the same sampling dates, shoot phosphorus content decreased when water velocity was high, particularly for C. obtusangula. Additionally, a significant effect of time period was observed for both species when the water velocities were low. The effect of water velocity was only significant from spring (April) to autumn (October) when plant phosphorus content was highest.					andrieu, muriel/AAV-5118-2020														0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2007	575						343	351		10.1007/s10750-006-0380-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0380-0													WOS:000242505000027

The focus was on climatic variables relevant for aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, i.e., air temperature, precipitation, snow depth, lake-ice cover, wind speed and solar radiation. Changes in these variables were categorized depending on how rapidly they are likely to emerge from the background of recently-experienced inter-annual variability. The statistically significant increases in annual and spring mean temperatures of about 0.4 degrees C per decade, observed during the period 1964-2011, are projected to continue in the future, accompanied by corresponding changes in snow depth and lake-ice duration. Based on the multi-model mean estimates, increases in annual mean precipitation and decreases in winter solar radiation would become statistically significant by the 2040s. In addition to the recorded inter-annual variability, inter-model uncertainty intervals were considered.

Energy Budgets for Eared Grebes on the Great Salt Lake and Implications for Harvest of Brine Shrimp	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												About 1.5-million eared grebes (Podiceps nigricollis), representing half of the North American population, stage on Utah's Great Salt Lake, USA (GSL) during autumn migration to forage on brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana). Indirectly competing with birds for brine shrimp are commercial harvesters who annually collect >1 million kg (dry wt) of shrimp cysts (i.e., hardened eggs), an amount that during some years equals up to half of all brine shrimp cysts produced annually on the GSL. No information was available regarding what impact this commercial harvest was having on eared grebes. We determined daily energy requirements of eared grebes so that regulations governing brine shrimp cyst harvest would better reflect foraging needs of grebes. We measured basal metabolic rate (BMR) of eared grebes from June 2000 to October 2000. Mean BMR of 106 adult and subadult eared grebes was 0.023 kJ/g/hour (SD = 0.004), and mean BMR of 37 juveniles was 0.024 kJ/g/hour (SD = 0.003). Resting and preening metabolic rates were 1.2 times higher than BMR, whereas diving-bout metabolic rate was 1.7 times higher than BMR. Daily energy needs of an average-sized grebe (550 g) during November were 391 kJ. Meeting this energy need requires daily consumption of 24,400 adult brine shrimp. In addition, grebes must consume 2,100-5,200 adult shrimp daily to obtain enough energy reserves to continue their migration to California, USA, and Mexico. Hence, grebes need to consume 26,500-29,600 adult brine shrimp daily while staging on GSL. To achieve this high harvest rate, grebes need adult brine shrimp densities at >380 shrimp/m(3) during autumn. Commercial harvest of brine shrimp cysts from GSL should be curtailed when cyst densities fall below 20,000 cysts/m(3) to ensure enough adult brine shrimp for grebes during the subsequent year.

Environmental controls of Cladophora growth dynamics in eastern Lake Erie:: Application of the Cladophora growth model (CGM)	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The Cladophora growth model (CGM) was used to estimate the importance of light, temperature, phosphorus, and self-shading on the spatial and temporal variability of Cladophora growth rates and biomass accrual in eastern Lake Erie during 2002. The CGM predicted that Cladophora growth was highly sensitive to spatial and temporal variations in soluble phosphorous concentration (SRP). Specifically the CGM predicted that: 1) Site-to-site differences in SRP concentration resulted in a 2x difference in depth-integrated biomass; 2) maximum growth rates were strongly influenced by SRP concentrations during periods of rapid biomass accrual (mid-June to mid-July); 3) inter-annual differences in SRP concentration during the spring period (similar to 1 mu g/L) could result in up to a 3.5x difference in depth integrated biomass; 4) Spatial variations in water clarity could result in a 2x difference in depth-integrated biomass between sites, with variations betweens sites occurring primarily between 2-6 m depth; 5) the mid-summer sloughing phenomenon likely resulted from self-shading by the algal canopy; and 6) the seasonal growth pattern of Cladophora was strongly regulated by temperature.

J	Dittrich, M; Koschel, R				Dittrich, M; Koschel, R			Interactions between calcite precipitation (natural and artificial) and phosphorus cycle in the hardwater lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The influence of calcite precipitation on the phosphorus cycle in stratified hardwater lake was studied before and during experiments with a new restoration technique. Surveys of the chemical composition of water column and monitoring of settling particles of Lake Luzin (North-East) showed that calcite precipitation occurs each year over 2-3 periods during spring and summer. The change of the phosphorus content influenced the calcite precipitation intensity. The sedimentation fluxes of phorphorus and the calcite precipitation were closely associated. Based on the hypothesis that calcite precipitation acts as an improvement to the trophic state by enhancing the internal phosphorus sink, this new technology for lake restoration was developed. The hypolimnetic Ca(OH)(2) addition during summer stratification in 1996-1997 induced the calcite precipitation in the deep water layer of Basin Carwitz of Lake Schmaler Luzin. The treatment also supported the natural calcite precipitation in the epilimnion. The annual total phosphorus content decreased from 0.46 tons in 1995 to 0.35 tons in 1997. The annual SRP content decreased from 0.02 tons in 1996 to 0.01 tons in 1997 after beginning the artificial calcite precipitation in 1996. The decrease of the annual Chl-a concentration in 1998 on 38% compared with that in 1996 pointed out the lake recovering. According to the one box model, the artificial calcite precipitation affected the P cycle in the lake by suppressing the P release from the sediments.

The aim of this study was a comparative assessment of the behaviour of brown bears with respect to the heterogeneity of trophic conditions. In 2018, considering an extremely high commercial catch of Oncorhynchus nerka (hereinafter - sockeye salmon or salmon) and high flood in the first half of the summer, the decline in the abundance and availability of salmon led to significant changes in the behaviour and distribution of bears. The success of fishing behaviour of bears in 2018 was found to be lower than in 2017. During the periods of salmon abundance in 2017, solitary bears formed temporary friendly associations that we did not observe in 2018. Due to the increased incidence of intraspecific predation in 2018, bears began to show aggression towards humans. Deterioration of the physical condition of some females and behavioural changes in food-procuring strategies were accompanied by the appearance of abandoned cubs. The peak of negative changes in the bear populations was noted in the first half of September when the energy requirements of bears increased. A modern approach to the development of the resources of sockeye salmon in the Basin of Lake Kurilskoe and River Ozernaya requires a serious revision of the fishing load in accordance with the characteristics of the population structure of sockeye salmon and its exclusive role in the local ecosystem. It is necessary to reconsider the "optimal" number of sockeye salmon allowed into the Lake Kurilskoe and its tributaries. The current practice of cancelling the passing days during which salmon can migrate unobstructed into and up the River Ozernaya towards Lake Kurilskoe is unacceptable.

ON THE ANTICIPATED UTILITY OF RCM CP DATA FOR FRESHWATER ICE MAPPING AND MONITORING	2014 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS)	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS				IEEE Joint International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS) / 35th Canadian Symposium on Remote Sensing	JUL 13-18, 2014	Quebec City, CANADA	IEEE, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Geoscience & Remote Sensing Soc, Canadian Remote Sensing Soc				The option to acquire compact polarimetry (CP) data will be available on all RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) imaging modes. Relative to RADARSAT-2's (R2) polarimetric data, RCM's CP data can be acquired over wider swaths (up to 500 km) but offer reduced polarization diversity. In addition, the nominal signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) for RCM modes fall short of those for R2 polarimetric modes. This paper presents results of an ongoing study into the utility of RCM CP data in support of the mapping and monitoring of freshwater ice cover. Specifically, the effects of the loss in polarization diversity and radiometric resolution on the information content regarding freshwater ice cover properties and processes are assessed. The results indicate that RCM CP data will offer good potential in support of spring breakup monitoring and ice type mapping. On the other hand, RCM CP data are expected to be of limited utility for freeze-up monitoring.					; Deschamps, Alexis/A-2112-2009	van der Sanden, Josephus Johannes/0000-0003-0407-2733; Geldsetzer, Torsten/0000-0001-7422-5833													2153-6996		978-1-4799-5775-0				2014							1564	1567		10.1109/IGARSS.2014.6946738	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2014.6946738													WOS:000349688102075

Dead benthic organisms were found on the bottom at depths of up to 4.5 m. During August, a freshwater phytoplankton bloom was recorded in Visovac lake (which supplies the Skradinski buk waterfalls). The green tide in the lake was composed of up to 11.9 million cells . l(-1), predominantly of Synedra acus End Dinobryon sertularia. At that time the maximal total inflow of phytoplankton cells through the waterfalls was approx. 0.41 . s(-1) (38000 l . d(-1)). Cells of these two species died after reaching the salt wedge and the cummulative effect of their decomposition apparently caused an oxygen demand sufficient enough to trigger the benthic mortality. Due to the water mass dynamics, the spreading of mortality downstream was slow (from August to October, approx. 5 km). Certain benthic fishes (like Gobius sp.) were observed on the bottom of the affected area in mid-October 1989.

J	Lamoureux, SF; England, JH; Sharp, MJ; Bush, ABG				Lamoureux, SF; England, JH; Sharp, MJ; Bush, ABG			A varve record of increased 'Little Ice Age' rainfall associated with volcanic activity, Arctic Archipelago, Canada	HOLOCENE												Varved sediments from Nicolay Lake, Canadian High Arctic, record major summer rainfall events over the last five centuries. Increased incidences of summer rainfall occurred during the coldest periods of the 'Little Ice Age' and were strongly clustered in the years immediately following major volcanic events. Comparison of the summer rainfall and proxy air temperature records thus provides a fuller understanding of the nature and causes of natural climate variability in the Arctic. Study of the synoptic conditions associated with the two most recent large summer rainfall events suggests that they are associated with the incursion of cold low-pressure systems from the Arctic Ocean Basin. Volcanic activity may produce atmospheric conditions more conducive to the formation of such low-pressure systems, which generate rainfall at low elevations and summer snowfall at higher elevations, thus explaining the correlation between rainfall and summer snow accumulation recorded in ice cores from high-elevation ice caps.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				MAR	2001	11	2					243	249		10.1191/095968301668776315	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/095968301668776315													WOS:000167169700009

However, the detailed climatic changes during this period are not completely understood. In this paper, we report a high-resolution pollen record for the Dayanghu wetland in the Zhejiang region of southeastern China, which we use to infer mean annual precipitation (MAP) fluctuations during the period spanning 4600-4000 calendar years before present (cal. yr BP). There was a long-term trend of decreasing MAP during this interval, consistent with weakening of the East Asian Summer Monsoon since the mid-Holocene. This trend was punctuated by episodes of relatively high MAP at 4350-4320, ca. 4260, and 4220-4200 cal. yr BP, and extreme droughts at 4200 and 4150 cal. yr BP. We propose that solar activity promoted El Nin & SIM;o events and contributed to dramatic MAP fluctuations in the Dayanghu wetland. La Nin & SIM;a events and negative-phase intervals of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation may have been responsible for the extreme drought at 4200-4150 cal. yr BP. In summary, we propose a close relationship between MAP and solar forcing, with short-term enhanced solar activity increasing the intensity of the East Asian Summer Monsoon and contributing to increasing decadal variability in the inner tropical Pacific, which ultimately leads to increased precipitation variability in southeast China. The results improve our understanding of the detailed climatic features of the 4.2 ka event.					; 凯, 李/KWU-0203-2024; Ni, Jian/I-7067-2012	Li, Kai/0000-0002-6197-4082; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				OCT 1	2023	627								111739	10.1016/j.palaeo.2023.111739	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2023.111739		JUL 2023											WOS:001054771500001

This study examines whether divergent habitats of Lake Bogoria, Kenya, impacts cyanobacterial community structure. Samples from the hot springs, pelagic zone and sediment were analysed by light microscopy, multilocus 454-amplicons sequencing and metagenomics to compare the cyanobacterial diversity. Most of the phylogenetic lineages of Cyanobacteria occurred exclusively in the Bogoria hot springs suggesting a high degree of endemism. The prevalent phylotypes were mainly members of the Oscillatoriales (Leptolyngbya, Spirulina, Oscillatoria-like and Planktothricoides). The Chroococcales were represented by different clades of Synechococcus but not a single phylotype clustered with any of the lineages described earlier from different continents. In contrast, we found that the pelagic zone and the sediments were inhabited by only a few taxa, dominated by Arthrospira and Anabaenopsis. Arthrospira, the main food base of Lesser Flamingo, was detected in all three habitats by amplicons pyrosequencing, indicating its resilience and key role as a primary producer. Despite the close connection between the three habitats studied, the cyanobacterial communities in the hot springs and lake differed considerably, suggesting that they are unable to adapt to the extreme conditions of the neighbouring habitat.

J	Shiller, AM				Shiller, Alan M.			Dissolved rare earth elements in a seasonally snow-covered, alpine/subalpine watershed, Loch Vale, Colorado	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Dissolved rare earth elements (REEs) were determined in a four-year time series at the outlet of Loch Vale. The Loch Vale watershed is a seasonally snow-covered alpine/subalpine basin in Rocky Mountain National Park, USA. The time series was mainly distinguished by an annual early spring peak in the concentrations of all REEs. REE concentrations at this time were as much as 8-fold greater than at other times of the year. This annual peak was coincident with an early spring peak in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) which results from flushing of soils at the be.-inning of spring snow melting. The REE/DOC peak occurs as discharge starts to increase from wintertime lows but well before the spring peak in discharge. Speciation considerations suggest complexation of the REEs by DOC. The Cc anomaly also increases (i.e., is less fractionated) during the spring flush indicating that the most reducing (or least oxidizing) REE sources in the system are comparatively more important at that time, Mn data and the La/Yb ratio also Support this. The behavior of REEs in the Loch Vale system has additionally been compared with metal and DOC behavior in other systems. Hydrologic and climatic differences can be important especially with regard to timing and duration of the spring flush peak. Damping of hydrologic events in the lower floodplain of major rivers may also partially result in the differences observed between Loch Vale and the lower Mississippi River. However, comparison with the Amazon River system additionally suggests that seasonal flooding of wetlands may be an important regulator of REE concentrations. Chemical differences are also important for these systems. This includes pH and suspended matter concentrations which affect the balance between adsorption and complexation. Additionally, the relative complexing ability of DOC in different systems is a factor needing further consideration. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Another 920 grebes crashed on the northbound migration in late March 1997. We examined 1,500 carcasses to determine the characteristics of the population during fall versus spring migration with regard to age and sex ratios, body mass, plumage abnormalities, presence of parasites, and morphological defects. In many cases, large samples derived from mass downings provide a reasonable index of the composition of birds aloft. However, we found important differences in sex ratios between two samples derived from the same flight, which indicates that assumptions regarding unbiased sampling require testing. The possibility that regular catastrophic events in central and southern Utah have influenced the evolution of migration routes in fared Grebes deserves further consideration.																				1938-4254				JAN	1999	116	1					178	183		10.2307/4089464	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4089464													WOS:000078244500017

Temporal stability and assignment power of adaptively divergent genomic regions between herring (Clupea harengus) seasonal spawning aggregations	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), a vital ecosystem component and target of the largest Northwest Atlantic pelagic fishery, undergo seasonal spawning migrations that result in elusive sympatric population structure. Herring spawn mostly in fall or spring, and genomic differentiation was recently detected between these groups. Here we used a subset of this differentiation, 66 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to analyze the temporal dynamics of this local adaptation and the applicability of SNP subsets in stock assessment. We showed remarkable temporal stability of genomic differentiation corresponding to spawning season, between samples taken a decade apart (2005 N = 90 vs. 2014 N = 71) in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and new evidence of limited interbreeding between spawning components. We also examined an understudied and overexploited herring population in Bras d'Or lake (N = 97); using highly reduced SNP panels (N-SNPs > 6), we verified little-known sympatric spawning populations within this unique inland sea. These results describe consistent local adaptation, arising from asynchronous reproduction in a migratory and dynamic marine species. Our research demonstrates the efficiency and precision of SNP-based assessments of sympatric subpopulations; and indeed, this temporally stable local adaptation underlines the importance of such fine-scale management practices.

Methane with Abnormally High δ13C and δD Values from the Coastal Hot Springs in Lake Baikal	LITHOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES												We studied the composition and isotopic characteristics (delta C-13 and delta D) of hydrocarbon gases from the Kotelnikovsky, Zmeiny, and Goryachnisky hot springs located in the coastal zone of Lake Baikal. Of greatest interest is the Zmeiny Spring located on the eastern coast, where the methane has abnormally high values of delta C-13 (up to +11 parts per thousand) and delta D (up to +267 parts per thousand). These values are related to the fractionation of carbon and hydrogen isotopes during the oxidation of microbial methane. The delta C-13-C-1 value (-40.2 parts per thousand) in the Goryachinsky Spring can formally indicate the thermogenic origin of methane. However, the modification of carbon isotope composition in this spring due to methane oxidation is more likely, because gas from the Goryachinsky Spring contains the microbial methane as admixture. Isotopic characteristics typical of microbial gases undistorted by secondary oxidation (delta C-13-C-1 = -61.5 parts per thousand, delta D-C-1 = -230.2 parts per thousand, delta C-13-C-2 = -56.6 parts per thousand) are recorded in the Kotelnikovsky Spring northwest of Lake Baikal.

The age model was based on a correlation of the diatom and chemical weathering records and the summer insolation curve at 55 degrees N and checked against an age model based on the proxy of relative palacointensity of the Earth's magnetic field. Peaks in chemical weathering within the watershed, inferred from maximum concentration of magnetic and coloured minerals and mica, the lowest mean Fe oxidation state in silicates and highs in expandable clay minerals correlated with the Northern Hemisphere summer insolation minima at 55 degrees N. Reconstructed changes in weathering intensity are better correlated to insolation patterns than to global ice volume records. We propose a scheme of yet missing palaeoenvironmental interpretation of the diatom assemblage, including also some extinct species. Aulacoseira baicalensis and Aulacoseira skvortzowii were abundant in the early stages of lake flora recovery immediately after deglaciation and during MIS 7e and MIS 5e; periods of more pronounced continental climate and peak chemical weathering. Stephanodiscus formosus var. minor, Cyclotella minuta and Cyclotella ornata dominated in intervals of decreased seasonality and decreased humidity at the end of most interglacial/interstadial diatom zones. Stephanodiscus grandis, Stephanodiscus carconeiformis and Stephanodiscus formosus were ubiquitous between MIS 8 and MIS 5, an interval marked by high seasonality, i.e., large differences between winter and summer insolation, and low humidity revealed by a low hydrolysis of expandable clay minerals in the watershed. Diatom concentrations peaked in the climatic optima of MIS 7e and MIS 5e and in the short periods marked by shifts to warmer conditions in the upper sections of MIS 5: MIS 5c (103-99 Icy BP), MIS 5b (90-88 ky BP), and MIS 5a (84-79 ky BP) in which increased humidity resulted in enhanced hydrolysis of clay minerals. No such short similar climatic optimums were found from NHS 9a to MIS 6.

Seven stomatocysts are reported from the spring; four are described as new morphotypes, and three have previously been observed in various parts of the world. A new term, I ornamentation with bullate swellings,' is introduced to describe a type of ornamentation not observed to date in any known stomatocysts. The present study documents for the first time an assemblage of chrysophyte stomatocysts from Africa in a unique ecosystem consisting of a thermal, highly mineralized spring.

Two main objectives for the harvest restriction were to increase the abundance of adult largemouth bass in the fishery and to maintain an abundant bass population so that the cyclic nature of this fishery would not be as severe. We examined the effects of the harvest restriction by comparing several population variables from sampling data collected 6 years before the length limit (1987-1992) and 6 years after the length limit (1994-1999). A large database was available due to consistent standardized sampling by Alabama and Georgia fisheries personnel. Spring proportional stuck density estimates did not change significantly, with an average of 63 before and 65 after the length limit. Fish conditions declined for every relative stock density (RSD) group, with Significantly lower mean relative weights for fish in the RSD-Stock and RSD-memorable groups, as well as for annual averages for all fish >200 mm. Growth was significantly slower for Age-2 through Age-5 fish, with fish requiring almost 10 additional months to reach 406 mm in length. Bass abundance increased after the length limit, with significant increases in RSD-P fish. After the length limit was imposed, young-of-year (YOY) shad, YOY bass, and spring adult bass densities continued to fluctuate. Spring electrofishing was low in 1998 following a chronic bass die-off during spring and summer 1997. Virology examinations confirmed the presence of largemouth bass virus in the population in 1997 and 1998. Creel survey data from 1984, 1987-1992, and 1999 indicated that angler effort for bass changed very little after the length limit, but harvest rates declined 85% to 95% while release of "keeper" fish increased to over 92%. The majority of anglers interviewed in 1999 (64%) indicated they did not wish to see the length limit changed. However, many negative comments from anglers, tournament organizers, and local business owners with an opposing view lead Alabama and Georgia fisheries personnel to re-examine possible changes to the 406-mm minimum length limit.																									2000							28	38																WOS:000175525900004

Hydrological parameters appear to be the principal controls on the loadings of atrazine in the St Lawrence River system throughout the year, except during the post-application period. In terms of the annual variability of loadings, prior to the application period, the spring freshet coincided with a major pulse of atrazine. A post-application peak load of atrazine was detected in the main river as well as in its tributaries. During the fall, atrazine loadings increased again. The results show that atrazine inputs to the system can be detected long after application. Average loadings in 1990 and 1991 were 7.7 and 4.4 kg/d in the St Lawrences River, and 0.4 and 0.2 kg/d in the tributaries studied. The seasonal variation of atrazine concentrations in surface waters of the tributaries was consistent with the temporal distribution reported in the literature, viz. peak concentrations during the post-application period. There was also an increase in concentrations in the main river channel during the fall, reflecting the fact that the main river also receives inputs from the Great Lakes and not only from proximate agricultural sources. The annual variability in atrazine concentration and loading in the tributaries was directly related to the proximity of agricultural sources. Average concentrations in 1990 and 1991 were 10.4 and 3.4 ng/l in the St Lawrence River, and 31.1 and 27.9 ng/l in the tributaries. The persistence of atrazine is believed to be a key element controlling its dynamics in these aquatic systems. The results demonstrate the widespread dispersion of atrazine in this river basin, with similar responses and seasonal trends being exhibited throughout.

T. annulata (Palisot de Beauvois, 1807) is a widespread species in south-western Europe, in Mediterranean countries and Balkan Peninsula. Despite this widespread, this species is reported for the first time for Albania's odonatofauna. T. annulata is part of the family Libellulidae, which has the largest number of species in Albania, 19 species, belonging to 5 genera: Libellula, Orthetrum, Sympetrum, Crocothemis and Selysiothemis. Trithemis is the sixth genus to be added to the family Libellulidae and T. annulata is the 66-th species in the list of Odonata for Albania (Shkembi et al. 2016). Nine male individuals of T. annulata were captured in two expeditions conducted in summer-fall 2017, in Belshi Lakes, in the central part of Albania and in Pishe-Poro, the Vjosa River Delta.																			2224-4980					JUL-OCT	2018	8	4					717	722		10.31407/ijees8410	http://dx.doi.org/10.31407/ijees8410													WOS:000464612800010
J	Wilson, N; Webster-Brown, J; Brown, K				Wilson, Nathaniel; Webster-Brown, Jenny; Brown, Kevin			The behaviour of antimony released from surface geothermal features in New Zealand	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Antimony-rich geothermal features in the Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ) of New Zealand's North Island drain directly into surface aquatic environments. The discharge from Champagne Pool, a mixed alkali-chloride/sulfate hot spring at Wai-O-Tapu Geothermal Field, contains up to 194 mu g/L Sb. The discharge from Frying Pan Lake, a chloride-sulfate hot spring at Waimangu Geothermal Field, contains up to 21.5 mu g/L Sb. At Champagne Pool, downstream concentrations of Sb show distinct diurnal variations, particularly in winter, when concentrations in the early morning were less than half those measured mid-afternoon. Changes in sulfide-sulfate equilibria and direct stibnite oxidation may explain this phenomenon. In the discharge from Frying Pan Lake, Sb exhibits little diurnal variation. Most (>80%) of the dissolved Sb released from Champagne Pool is removed from solution at Alum Lake, an acid-sulfate hot pool containing elevated levels of dissolved sulfide. Therefore relatively little Sb is discharged into the freshwater drainage in the area. However, in the absence of a sulfide-rich feature at Waimangu, most of the Sb discharged from Frying Pan Lake remains dissolved, and is transported into the freshwater drainage system of Lake Rotomahana. The contrast in Sb behaviour between these two sites confirms the importance of dissolved sulfide and low (<3) pH conditions in the precipitation and removal of dissolved Sb downstream of geothermal features. Otherwise, largely conservative behaviour can be expected. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The temperature reconstruction from Coleoptera is obtained from the Mutual Climatic Range Method, or "MCR" method, based on the range of climates corresponding to the area occupied today by the species identified in fossil assemblages. The Weighthed Averaging Partial Least Squared (WA-PLS) method is used to produce mean July temperature estimates from Chironomid assemblages. Climate reconstruction from pollen data is performed using an assemblage approach, the Modern Analogue Technique. During the Late-Glacial the July temperature (Tmax) reconstructed from beetles (Coleoptera) was lower than the current Tmax of 18.9 degrees C. Summer conditions were close to the present at the beginning of the Oldest Dryas (17400-14600 cal. BP), and during most of the Allerod (13900-12800 cal. BP). During the Younger Dryas (12800-11700 cal. BP) Tmax estimates ranged from 12 to 13 degrees C, much lower than today. The Tmax increased at the onset of the Holocene (11700 cal. BP), reaching values close to the modern conditions from the beginning of the period. Tmax reconstructed from chironomids shows an initial warming around 15000 cal. BP, with a Tmax rise from 7 degrees C to 11 degrees C. A maximum (13.5 degrees C) was reached around 13800 cal. BP. A second optimum of 16 degrees C occurred after 10800 cal. BP. The Late-Glacial Interstadial (LGI) is marked by temperature decreases (from 13 to 12 to 10-9 degrees C) around 13200-12900 cal. BP. A second climate minimum was reached around 12600 cal. BP, during the Younger Dryas (Tmax about 10 degrees C). The end of the Younger Dryas seems to have been warmer, with a Tmax of about 13 degrees C, just before the early Holocene climate improvement. Pollen-inferred results showed that the Late-Glacial climate at Roustieres was characterized by colder and drier winter and summer seasons than today, and by conditions close to the modern ones around 11700 cal. BP, at the onset of the Holocene. Climate conditions comparable to the modern ones were also evidenced at the end of the Allerod, with colder than today conditions evidenced from both Tmax and Tmin (January temperature). During the Oldest and Younger Dryas the coldest month showed a temperature of -13 degrees C, while summers appeared more moderate (warmest month around 16 degrees C). Cold conditions were also reconstructed during the Bolling, while temperatures comparable to present-day values were reached during the Allerod. A cold oscillation occurred around 13400 cal. BP. Particularly dry conditions were reconstructed during the Oldest Dryas (17000-15800 cal. BP). From 15800 to the end of the Younger Dryas, the precipitation oscillated around 750 mm, but increased during the Allerod and the Holocene periods. These climatic trends reconstructed by the three proxies allowed identifying the temperate periods (LGI and the Holocene) and the cold events (Younger Dryas) of the Late-Glacial period. However, difficulties due to different sampling resolutions emerged, and several discrepancies linked to the proxy or the methods used are discussed.					; Gandouin, Emmanuel/AAM-9745-2021; Guiter, Frédéric/R-5166-2017	Guiter, Frederic/0000-0003-0044-2426; Ponel, Philippe/0000-0003-2849-9977; 													1040-6182	1873-4553				OCT 30	2022	636						39	51		10.1016/j.quaint.2022.02.005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2022.02.005		SEP 2022											WOS:000867753300001

Diel feeding activity and diet of red roach (Rutilus arcasii) were determined on five occasions (February, April, June, August and November 1985) in a seasonal, fluctuating stream subject to severe summer droughts and cold winter floods. 2. Except in June, the two age groups of the population (less-than-or-equal-to 1 + and > 1 +) fed mainly on detritus and showed no significant differences either in their feeding intensity or in the relative contribution of the main diet components (detritus, plants and invertebrates). 3. The size, abundance and availability of drifting invertebrates influenced red roach feeding. When drift was scarce or inaccessible, both age groups fed on detritus, plants, or a combination of the two. These niche shifts were a trophic tactic aimed at maintaining feeding when other, more nutritional and energetically valuable foods were scarce. 4. A comparison with other populations suggested that a detritus-based diet had no major cost in the life history of the red roach. We hypothesize that the highly opportunistic trophic strategy of this Iberian endemic cyprinid is an adaptative response to seasonal Mediterranean streams.																			0046-5070					AUG	1994	32	1					123	132		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1994.tb00872.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1994.tb00872.x													WOS:A1994PC85900013

Average surface air temperature has increased 0.3 degreesC per decade during the twentieth century in the western North American Arctic and boreal forest zones. Precipitation has also increased, but changes in soil moisture are uncertain. Disturbance rates have increased in the boreal forest; for example, there has been a doubling of the area burned in North America in the past 20 years. The disturbance regime in tundra may not have changed. Tundra has a 3-6-fold higher winter albedo than boreal forest, but summer albedo and energy partitioning differ more strongly among ecosystems within either tundra or boreal forest than between these two biomes. This indicates a need to improve our understanding of vegetation dynamics within, as well as between, biomes. If regional surface warming were to continue, changes in albedo and energy absorption would likely act as a positive feedback to regional warming due to earlier melting of snow and, over the long term, the northward movement of treeline. Surface drying and a change in dominance from mosses to vascular plants would also enhance sensible heat flux and regional warming in tundra. In the boreal forest of western North America, deciduous forests have twice the albedo of conifer forests in both winter and summer, 50-80% higher evapotranspiration, and therefore only 30-50% of the sensible heat flux of conifers in summer. Therefore, a warming-induced increase in fire frequency that increased the proportion of deciduous forests in the landscape, would act as a negative feedback to regional warming. Changes in thermokarst and the aerial extent of wetlands, lakes, and ponds would alter high-latitude methane flux. There is currently a wide discrepancy among estimates of the size and direction of CO2 flux between high-latitude ecosystems and the atmosphere. These discrepancies relate more strongly to the approach and assumptions for extrapolation than to inconsistencies in the underlying data. Inverse modelling from atmospheric CO2 concentrations suggests that high latitudes are neutral or net sinks for atmospheric CO2, whereas field measurements suggest that high latitudes are neutral or a net CO2 source. Both approaches rely on assumptions that are difficult to verify. The most parsimonious explanation of the available data is that drying in tundra and disturbance in boreal forest enhance CO2 efflux. Nevertheless, many areas of both tundra and boreal forests remain net sinks due to regional variation in climate and local variation in topographically determined soil moisture. Improved understanding of the role of high-latitude ecosystems in the climate system requires a concerted research effort that focuses on geographical variation in the processes controlling land-atmosphere exchange, species composition, and ecosystem structure. Future studies must be conducted over a long enough time-period to detect and quantify ecosystem feedbacks.					; Chapin, F/AAZ-3931-2020; Zimov, Sergey/JCD-7517-2023; Eugster, Werner/E-5116-2010; Roulet, Nigel/W-3402-2019; Pielke, Roger/A-5015-2009; Randerson, James/Y-2550-2019; Baldocchi, Dennis/A-1625-2009	Randerson, James/0000-0001-6559-7387; Hobbie, Sarah/0000-0001-5159-031X; Rastetter, Edward/0000-0002-8620-5431; Chapin III, F Stuart/0000-0002-2558-9910; Roulet, Nigel/0000-0001-9571-1929; Eugster, Werner/0000-0001-6067-0741; Zimov, Sergey/0000-0002-0053-6599; Baldocchi, Dennis/0000-0003-3496-4919													1354-1013	1365-2486				DEC	2000	6			1			211	223		10.1046/j.1365-2486.2000.06022.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2486.2000.06022.x								35026938					WOS:000166799900015

Understanding Saimaa ringed seal haulout patterns and their response to boat traffic is crucial for designing sustainable land use and tourism guidelines. Responses of unidentified seals to small outboard motor boat traffic were studied during the moulting season. The median distance at which the seals responded to an approaching boat was 240 m. GPS-phone tags were used to study both circadian and seasonal haulout behaviour patterns of individual seals (n = 8) during the open-water season. The average post-moulting haulout duration was 6 +/- 5 h (SD), with a maximum of over 26 h. The seals spent more time hauled out at night (between 21:00 and 06:00 h) after the moult. The time spent hauled out and the haulout frequency declined from early summer to autumn. An individual seal had an average of 13 haulout sites, which were an average of 2.5 km apart. Approximately half of these haulout sites were located in the core 50% of the individual seals' home ranges. The high level of site fidelity emphasizes the need to identify suitable haulout areas and to develop measures for protecting the main resting sites of this endangered population. Additionally, guidelines for seal watching should be developed in order to mitigate the potential disturbance caused by increasing tourism on Lake Saimaa.																			1863-5407	1613-4796					2013	22	2					115	124		10.3354/esr00541	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/esr00541													WOS:000327760700003

During the summer, the elements (and/or ions) Al, PO43--P, V, As, Mo, B, Ce, Y, Zr, Sb, Cr characterized by a high ion potential and a high energy coefficient chiefly accumulate in the epilimnion rich in oxygen. However, the hypolimnion, which is free of oxygen, features increased concentrations of the dissolved elements (and/or ions) Mn, Co, NH4+-N, Zn, Cd, Cu, and Ni. From the beginning of the hydrologic winter (case II), the lake water is completely intermingled with the cold incoming Mulde water streams, and the anoxic conditions of the deep water zones disappear. The distribution of element concentrations intermingled in the water body is characterized by processes of dilution and increases in concentration as well as by element-specific precipitation and reverse dissolution.																			0323-4320					FEB	2004	31	4-5					378	390		10.1002/aheh.200300497	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aheh.200300497													WOS:000189315900012

The species has a broad geographic distribution but has become rare and endangered by eutrophication and global change. The lakes are mesotrophic (Gr. Ratzeburger See) and eutrophic (KI. Kuchensee, Cr. Kuchensee) with cool (<10 degrees C) hypolimnia; they have surface areas of 12.6, 0.2 and 1.8 km(2) and a maximum depth of 24.9, 12.8 and 14.7 in, respectively. All three lakes are shallower than lakes reported as typical habitats for E. lacustris. Oxygen conditions in the hypolimnion were different in the two years of investigation. In 2000, the oxygen concentration in summer (July) was zero from 13 m downwards in the Cr. Ratzeburger See and zero from 7 in downwards in the KI and Gr. Kuchensee. In the year 2008 the hypolimnia of both lakes were well oxygenated in summer (>1 mg O-2 L-1). Food and physical conditions seem to be favourable enough to permit survival and reproduction of the species at least in spring. It remains unclear, however, whether the populations in the studied lakes are autochthonous. Eurytemora lacustris possibly invaded the lakes or was transported via a canal from the Schaalsee upstream, where a viable population exists.																			1129-5767	1723-8633					2011	70	1					145	148		10.4081/jlimnol.2011.145	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2011.145													WOS:000294320300017

Aerobic methanotrophs from the coastal thermal springs of Lake Baikal	MICROBIOLOGY												The number, activity, and diversity of aerobic methanotrophic bacteria in the sediments of three coastal thermal springs of Lake Baikal were analyzed. The average number of methanotrophs was 10(3)-10(4) cells per 1 cm(3) of sediment. The highest number of methanotrophs (10(8) cells/cm(3) of silt) and the highest potential rate of methane uptake [7.7 nmol CH4/(cm(3) day)] were revealed in sediments from the Sukhaya thermal spring. The methods of molecular ecology (DGGE, FISH, analysis of pmoA gene fragments) showed the predominance in most enrichment cultures of methanotrophs of type II, i.e., of the genera Methylocystis and Methylosinus. In only one enrichment culture (from the Sukhaya thermal spring), a type I methanotroph was revealed; its similarity to Methylococcus capsulatus Bath did not exceed 80%.

J	Huang, RH; Zhang, RH; Zhang, QY				Huang, RH; Zhang, RH; Zhang, QY			The 1997/98 ENSO cycle and its impact on summer climate anomalies in East Asia	ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												The observed data of the sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies and the sea temperature (ST) in the sub-layer of the equatorial Pacific, the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data and the data set of daily precipitation in China are used to analyze the characteristics of the 1997/98 ENSO cycle and its impact on summer climate anomalies in East Asia. The results show that the 1997/98 ENSO cycle, the strongest one in the 20th century, might be characterized by rapid development and decay and eastward propagation from the West Pacific warm pool Influenced by the ENSO cycle, in 1997, the serious drought and hot summer occurred in North China, and in the summer of 1998, the severe floods occurred in the Yangtze River valley, especially in the Dongting Lake and Boyang Lake valleys, South Korea and Japan. The analysis also shows that: influenced by the 1997/98 ENSO cycle, the water vapor transportation by the Asian monsoon in the summer of 1997 was very different from that in the summer of 1998, In the summer of 1997, the water vapor transportation by the Asian summer monsoon was weak in North China and the northern part of the Korea Peninsula. Thus, it caused the drought and hot summer in North China. However, in the summer of 1998, the sea temperature in the sub-layer of the West Pacific warm pool dropped, the western Pacific subtropical high shifted southward. Thus, a large amount of water vapor was transported from the Bay of Bengal, the South China Sea and the tropical western Pacific into the Yangtze River valley of China, South Korea and Japan, and the severe flood occurred there.

Ecological impacts of winter water level drawdowns on lake littoral zones: a review	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Freshwater littoral zones harbor diverse ecological communities and serve numerous ecosystem functions that are controlled, in part, by natural water level fluctuations. However, human alteration of lake hydrologic regimes beyond natural fluctuations threaten littoral zone ecological integrity. One type of hydrologic alteration in lakes is winter water level drawdowns, which are frequently employed for hydropower, flood control, and macrophyte control, among other purposes. Here, we synthesize the abiotic and biotic responses to annual and novel winter water level drawdowns in littoral zones of lakes and reservoirs. The dewatering, freezing, and increased erosion of exposed lakebeds drive changes in the littoral zone. Shoreline-specific physicochemical conditions such as littoral slope and shoreline exposure further induce modifications. Loss of fine sediment decreases nutrient availability over time, but desiccation may promote a temporary nutrient pulse upon re-inundation. Annual winter drawdowns can decrease taxonomic richness of macrophytes and benthic invertebrates and shift assemblage composition to favor taxa with r-selected life history strategies and with functional traits resistant to direct and indirect drawdown effects. Fish assemblages, though less directly affected by winter drawdowns (except where there is critically low dissolved oxygen), experience negative effects via indirect pathways like decreased food resources and spawning habitat. We identify eight general research gaps to guide future research that could improve our understanding about the complex effects of winter drawdowns on littoral zone ecology.

A Near-Term Iterative Forecasting System Successfully Predicts Reservoir Hydrodynamics and Partitions Uncertainty in Real Time	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Freshwater ecosystems are experiencing greater variability due to human activities, necessitating new tools to anticipate future water quality. In response, we developed and deployed a real-time iterative water temperature forecasting system (FLARE-Forecasting Lake And Reservoir Ecosystems). FLARE is composed of water temperature and meteorology sensors that wirelessly stream data, a data assimilation algorithm that uses sensor observations to update predictions from a hydrodynamic model and calibrate model parameters, and an ensemble-based forecasting algorithm to generate forecasts that include uncertainty. Importantly, FLARE quantifies the contribution of different sources of uncertainty (driver data, initial conditions, model process, and parameters) to each daily forecast of water temperature at multiple depths. We applied FLARE to Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia, USA), a drinking water supply, during a 475-day period encompassing stratified and mixed thermal conditions. Aggregated across this period, root mean square error (RMSE) of daily forecasted water temperatures was 1.13 degrees C at the reservoir's near-surface (1.0 m) for 7-day ahead forecasts and 1.62 degrees C for 16-day ahead forecasts. The RMSE of forecasted water temperatures at the near-sediments (8.0 m) was 0.87 degrees C for 7-day forecasts and 1.20 degrees C for 16-day forecasts. FLARE successfully predicted the onset of fall turnover 4-14 days in advance in two sequential years. Uncertainty partitioning identified meteorology driver data as the dominant source of uncertainty in forecasts for most depths and thermal conditions, except for the near-sediments in summer, when model process uncertainty dominated. Overall, FLARE provides an open-source system for lake and reservoir water quality forecasting to improve real-time management.					; Carey, Cayelan/D-4874-2016; Thomas, R./B-1611-2013	Figueiredo, Renato/0000-0001-9841-6060; Daneshmand, Vahid/0000-0003-4181-1806; Thomas, R.

Higher elevation shrubs and summer-flowering grasses expanded downslope across what is now the edge of Absolute Desert, a broad expanse now largely devoid of rainfall and vegetation. Paradoxically, this pluvial period coincided with the summer insolation minimum and reduced adiabatic heating over the central Andes. Summer precipitation over the central Andes and central Atacama may depend on remote teleconnections between seasonal insolation forcing in both hemispheres, the Asian monsoon, and Pacific sea surface temperature gradients. A Less pronounced episode of higher groundwater Levels in the central Atacama from 8 to 3 ky B.P. conflicts with an extreme lowstand of Lake Titicaca, indicating either different climatic forcing or different response times and sensitivities to climatic change.

The Late Glacial (similar to 14 500-11 700 cal yr BP) spring onset and growing season (growing degree days) dynamics in the eastern Baltic region were reconstructed using the micro-phenological approach based on the dwarf birch (Betula nana) subfossil leaf cuticles. The presented study sites, Lake Lielais Svetinu (eastern Latvia) and Lake Kosilase (central Estonia), are located similar to 200 km apart in the region affected by the south-eastern sector of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet. During the Late Glacial period the region and its biota were influenced by the retreating glacier and the different stages of the Baltic Ice Lake. The plant macrofossil data confirm that the study sites were in different vegetation zones (arctic-to-boreal) during the Late Glacial period. The dynamics of the estimated length of the growing season and spring onset, combined with the regional collection of plant macrofossil records, suggest the importance of local settings to species migration. During the Late Glacial warming period (Bolling-Allerod), a notable spring warming and longer growing season was calculated based on micro-phenology, but the treeline did not extend beyond central Estonia. The comparison of pollen- and chironomid-inferred past temperature estimations with spring onset, growing degree days, and plant macrofossil data shows coherent patterns during the cooler Older Dryas and warmer Bolling-Allerod periods, while suggesting more complicated climate dynamics and possible warmer episodes during the Younger Dryas cold reversal.

MATURATION, FECUNDITY, AND GENERATION TIMES	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Maturation rates, fecundity, and generation times in Artemia fransiscana Kellogg 1906 from Lake Grassmere, New Zealand, were studied in the laboratory using up to 24 replicated combinations of temperature (8 to 32.degree. C) and salinity (80 to 260 .permill.) with adequate natural algal food. Fecundity was calculated from individual counts of offspring from separate replicate females over their reproductive life, and also by estimation using replicates each containing a number of females. The numbers of batches of offspring, and numbers of offspring per batch were determined, along with time spans for gestation period and length of reproductive life for females in each temperature-salinity combination. Relationships between these reproductive variables were examined using correlations and scattergrams. Polynomial prediction models were constructed for both time to 50% maturity and for generation times. Experimental generation times were used to estimate the number of generations per year in the Lake Grassmere ponds based on known temperature-salinity combinations over an annual cycle. Reproduction was primarily ovoviviparous, resulting in batches of nauplii, rather than resistant cysts which accounted for only 6.85% of the reproductive output. Some alternation of reproductive mode and evidence of composite batches was recorded. Results for ANOVA showed that both temperature and salinity have independent significant effects (at the 99% level) on time to 50% maturity, batch size and number, fecundity, and generation times as well as the lengths of gestation and reproductive life in female A. fransiscana. Temperature is the more influential factor for gestation and generation time, and also for time to 50% maturity. Temperature and salinity rarely acted independently. (Interactive effects of temperature with salinity were also significant at the 99% level with the exception of offspring per batch). Results indicated that the temperature range 20 to 28.degree. C in salinities 120 to 22.permill. are optimal conditions for maturation and for all reproductive variables considered. Artemia in the Lake Grassmere ponds were estimated to complete seven generations per year after overwintering as adults or juveniles, and were capable of very rapid and possibly exponential population growth during late spring through summer to early autumn, when pond system biomass was highest.

The Evaluation Of Water Quality Of Nizhniy Kaban Lakeusing Next-Generation Sequencing	RESEARCH JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL SCIENCES												Today, bioindication is used to assess the environment, including water bodies. The method consists in studying the species of indicators inhabiting the medium under study, having been determined up to the present time visually by means of a microscope. As an alternative to the visual approach, the paper considers a method for identifying hydrobionts by the CO1 marker gene based on the DNA-barcoding method and modern sequencing methods. The sequenced sequences of the fragment of the CO1 hydrobiont gene of freshwater Nizhniy Kaban lake in the autumn (2016) and summer (2017) sampling periods in the fastq format are included in the international database on the NCBI's website with unique numbers SRR5839797(2016) andSRR5852707 (2017). The paper presents the results of the analysis and gives an assessment of the water quality of Nizhniy Kaban lake (Kazan, Russia). Comparative analysis of metagenomic data shows that most of the animals of Lower Kaban lake are grouped near the b-mesosaprobic zone. By water quality Nizhniy Kaban lake can be characterized as moderately polluted and as of 2017 is transitional from b-mesosaprobic to a-mesosaprobic.

The early Miocene paleolake Manuherikia: vegetation heterogeneity and warm-temperate to subtropical climate in southern New Zealand	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The Manuherikia Group in southern New Zealand represents terrestrial sediments associated with a large paleolake, Lake Manuherikia, formed during a period of basin subsidence in the early Miocene, ca. 18.7-15.1 Ma. Micro- and macrofloral assemblages collected throughout the Manuherikia Group were studied to derive terrestrial climate proxies, relying on leaf physiognomy (CLAMP) and taxonomic affinity (bioclimatic analysis). The assemblages were also analyzed for the component loading of the relative abundances of different leaf morphotypes and the results were interpreted in light of stratigraphic and lateral ecological variation. Independent paleoclimate proxies from a variety of depositional environments consistently indicate warm-temperate to marginally subtropical mean annual temperatures (16.5-20 A degrees C) and high annual precipitation (1,500-2,500 mm) during the Burdigalian-Langhian of mid-latitude New Zealand. Leaf physiognomy reveals an amplified seasonal contrast in both precipitation and temperature, possibly caused by seasonal shifts in the position of the subtropical high-pressure cells and westerly wind belts, causing overcast wet winters and dry summers. Regional and local vegetation variation was most likely caused by fluctuations in lake levels, which in turn may have been affected by enhanced seasonality from short-term climate oscillations.

Habitat use by migrant shorebirds in saline lakes of the Southern Great Plains	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Shorebirds migrating through the Southern Great Plains of North America use saline lakes as stopovers to rest and replenish energy reserves. To understand how availability of invertebrates, salinity, freshwater springs, vegetation, and water influence the value of saline lakes as migration stopovers, we compared lakes used and not used by migrant shorebirds. Shorebirds used lakes that had freshwater springs, mudflats and standing water, sparse vegetation (<= 1% cover), low to moderate salinities (x = 30.87 g/L), and mean invertebrate biomass of 0.79 g/m(2). Lakes that were not used were generally dry or had hypersaline water (x = 82.56 g/L), lacked flowing springs and vegetation, and had few or no invertebrates (x = 0.007 g/m(2)). Our results suggest that reduced spring flows and increased salinity negatively affect availability of shorebird habitats and aquatic invertebrates. We recommend preservation of the freshwater springs discharging in the saline lakes. Because the springs are discharged from the Ogallala aquifer, which is recharged through the playa wetlands, the entire complex of wetlands in the Great Plains and the Ogallala aquifer should be managed as an integral system.																			0022-541X	1937-2817				JAN	2008	72	1					246	253		10.2193/2007-144	http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/2007-144													WOS:000252624700029

In recent years, due to human activities and climate change, the area of wetlands has shown a downward trend, and the number and habitat of wintering migratory birds have been threatened. It is urgent to evaluate the habitat quality of wintering migratory birds in PLNNR. Therefore, the InVEST model and landscape index were used to evaluate the habitat quality of wintering migratory birds, and the grey correlation theory was used to reveal the response of typical wintering migratory bird population to habitat quality. The results showed that the habitat quality of the PLNNR was still at a high level, but showed a downward trend, with the average index of habitat quality decreasing from 0.872 to 0.817. The area of the highest quality habitat decreased by 3394.92 hm(2), the area of the lowest, low, and medium quality habitats increased by 3112.11 hm(2), and the area of the high quality habitat remained stable. The lowest, low, and medium quality habitat expanded from the middle to the south of the PLNNR mainly because of the expansion of construction land and cultivated land. The area with deterioration in habitat quality was 10,477.53 hm(2), mainly concentrated in the center and south of the PLNNR. The area with restoration in habitat quality was 6148.26 hm(2), mainly concentrated in the Bang Lake and Dacha Lake. The area with no change in habitat quality remained stable. The fragmentation degree and shape complexity of highest and high quality habitats increased, dominance degree and connectivity decreased, and the landscape pattern of habitat quality showed a downward trend. Typical wintering migratory birds have a strong correlation with highest, high, and low habitat quality, and there is a downward trend with the deterioration of habitat quality. Finally, this paper puts forward constructive suggestions on the degradation of habitat quality caused by land-use change.

It extended from shore to just beyond the limit of emergent vegetation. During the spring of the year before development of vegetation, water along the transect had homogeneous characteristics. This was not the case when concentrations of electrolytes, electric conductivity, turbidity, planktonic chlorophyll a and periphytic chlorophyll a were measured in mid-summer. At that time, submersed and emergent vegetation was at annual maximum biomass and a discontinuity bar existed where parameters changed rapidly with distance along the transect. Location of the bar changed from time-to-time within a zone 250-350 m from shore as water surged shoreward and then receded during seiches. Currents associated with these changes were measured in the vicinity of the bar. They ran perpendicular to the shoreline and were generally on the order of 2-7 cm/s. During a severe storm depth of water in the wetland increased more than 50 cm in one hour with flow rates rising to about 10 cm/s. Mixing between near-shore and offshore water in the wetland occurred during this event, but the discontinuity was not broken down. Temperature and solute-related density differences in water on opposite sides of the discontinuity were always small. Aquatic plants appeared to dampen currents and mixing enough to allow these and other differences to persist as prominent mid-summer features of this wetland.																			0270-5060					JUN	1995	10	2					111	123		10.1080/02705060.1995.9663425	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1995.9663425													WOS:A1995RF35300003

Simon			On Tanzania's Precipitation Climatology, Variability, and Future Projection	CLIMATE												We investigate historical and projected precipitation in Tanzania using observational and climate model data. Precipitation in Tanzania is highly variable in both space and time due to topographical variations, coastal influences, and the presence of lakes. Annual and seasonal precipitation trend analyses from 1961 to 2016 show maximum rainfall decline in Tanzania during the long rainy season in the fall (March-May), and an increasing precipitation trend in northwestern Tanzania during the short rainy season in the spring (September-November). Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis applied to Tanzania's precipitation patterns shows a stronger correlation with warmer temperatures in the western Indian Ocean than with the eastern-central Pacific Ocean. Years with decreasing precipitation in Tanzania appear to correspond with increasing sea surface temperatures (SST) in the Indian Ocean, suggesting that the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) may have a greater effect on rainfall variability in Tanzania than the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) does. Overall, the climate model ensemble projects increasing precipitation trend in Tanzania that is opposite with the historical decrease in precipitation. This observed drying trend also contradicts a slightly increasing precipitation trend from climate models for the same historical time period, reflecting challenges faced by modern climate models in representing Tanzania's precipitation.

Breeding occurred all year in C. lucasi but in midsummer C. dubia were absent and B. meridionalis were absent or rare. The two cladocerans were most abundant in late autumn-early winter and C. dubia was usually numerically dominant and appeared to partially displace B. meridionalis briefly in May. B. meridionalis contributed 49 %, C. lucasi 27 % and C. dubia 24 % of zooplankton production. Production and mean clutch size of B. meridionalis in Lake Okaro was the greatest known for a New Zealand cladoceran. The instantaneous birth rate of C. lucasi in Lake Okaro was higher than in other New Zealand lakes but still lower than in lakes of other regions. Annual production of carbon by the three species in 1979-80 was 3.2 percent of the annual production of phytoplankton carbon produced in 1980-81. The annual P/B ratio for C. lucasi of 9.89 was comparable with calanoids in other lakes but those for the two cladocerans were 4-6 times greater.																			0003-9136					JAN	1991	120	3					287	314																WOS:A1991EX90500003

Sampling campaigns were conducted within different seasons related to different agricultural activities in the vicinity of the protected area. The intensive use of pesticides led to the more frequent detection of specific pesticides such as Terbuthylazine, alpha-Cypermethrin, and Aminomethyl phosphonic acid (AMPA) during the summer, compared to the autumn campaign. In addition to these pesticide residues, other organic pollutants, including phthalate esters, fatty acids, phenols, and aldehydes, were also detected. The characterization of water from collectors in the protected area of Lake Zobnatica, in the Vojvodina region, provided reliable data on the contamination of the selected wetland locality required for effective risk assessments and risk management standards of the selected ecosystem. Additionally, three different water pollution indices were calculated using physicochemical data, offering a comprehensive water quality evaluation in the wetland. Environmental risk evaluation identified five compounds with highrisk quotients: diisobutyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, eicosane, phenol, 2,4-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-, and diphenyl sulfide.

The model was adjusted for Chesapeake Bay (USA) conditions to estimate bay anchovy population production and consumption as a function of bay anchovy hatch date, annual mortality, and acoustic measures of fish abundance. Spatially explicit models of bay anchovy consumption were developed to demonstrate how changes in spatial patterning and absolute scaling of the biological and physical environment might affect prey consumption in May and July. In model simulations, bay anchovy grew 3 to 6 % d-1 during summer and fall, and young-of-the-year (YOY) bay anchovy biomass peaked in November (16 270 kg km-2). Weight-specific consumption rate of juvenile bay anchovy was about 60 % d-1 during summer, and population consumption peaked in September (3350 kg km-2 d-1). Population production rate of YOY also peaked in September at 290 kg km-2 d-1, and annual production was 30 770 kg km-2. If all mortality was due to predation, bay anchovy could provide 133 kg food km-2 d-1 for piscivores in November, which could support the maximum daily consumption of 13 300 age-2 striped bass Morone saxatilis per km2. The average trophic efficiency of bay anchovy was 10.7 % with a large seasonal variation (0 to 18 %). Sensitivity analyses identified that weight and temperature-specific consumption and respiration parameters were most sensitive in model simulations of fish growth. Compared with the estimated zooplankton production, the average bay anchovy consumption only accounted for a small portion of daily zooplankton production. But our spatially-explicit model indicated that local depletions of zooplankton were possible due to spatial patchiness of predator and habitat heterogeneity, particularly in July.																			0171-8630					AUG	1993	98	3					223	236		10.3354/meps098223	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps098223													WOS:A1993LV28500003

Winter Survival, Habitat Use, and Hypoxia Tolerance of Montana Arctic Grayling in a Winterkill-Prone Lake	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Winter hypoxia in shallow, ice-covered lakes can be a significant limiting factor for overwintering fish populations. In this study we tested the hypothesis that low overwinter survival due to winter hypoxia is a limiting factor for a rare, adfluvial population of native Arctic Grayling Thymallus arcticus inhabiting Upper Red Rock Lake, Montana. We used a combined laboratory and telemetry study to document the extent of hypoxia over two winters and to assess the physiological tolerance, behavioral response, and winter survival in relation to hypoxia. In the laboratory, we observed a significant behavioral and physiological response to dissolved oxygen (DO) levels <= 4.0 mg/L and determined acute 24-h LC50 values (concentration lethal to 50% of test fish) of 0.75 mg/L DO for adults and 1.50-1.96 mg/L for juveniles at temperatures of 1-3 degrees C. In the field study, we observed dynamic DO concentrations (DO < 1.0 to 10.0 mg/L) during winter ice cover, ranging from persistent near-anoxic conditions near the bottom to DO concentrations > 4.0 mg/L in the epilimnion. Radiotelemetry indicated adult winter survival rate was high (0.97 in 2014, 0.95 in 2015) and that telemetered fish selected deeper (>1 m), more oxygenated habitat during ice cover. Our study demonstrated that Arctic Grayling have a high tolerance to acute hypoxia exposure and exhibit a physiological and behavioral stress response to DO concentrations <= 4.0 mg/L. Although hypoxia was present in parts of the lake, sufficient suitable habitat with DO > 4.0 mg/L was available in the lake epilimnion in both study winters. However, winter conditions more severe than those observed during our 2-year study occur periodically in the lake, and thus winterkill could still be a limiting factor for the population.

J	Finger, D; Schmid, M; Wuest, A				Finger, David; Schmid, Martin; Wuest, Alfred			Comparing effects of oligotrophication and upstream hydropower dams on plankton and productivity in perialpine lakes	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												In recent decades, many perialpine lakes have been affected by oligotrophication due to efficient sewage treatment and by altered water turbidity due to upstream hydropower operations. Such simultaneous environmental changes often lead to public debate on the actual causes of observed productivity reductions. We evaluate the effects of those two changes by a combined approach of modeling and data interpretation for a case study on Lake Brienz ( Switzerland), a typical oligotrophic perialpine lake, located downstream of several hydropower reservoirs. A physical k-epsilon scheme and a biogeochemical advection-diffusion-reaction model were implemented and applied for several hypothetical scenarios with different nutrient loads and different particle input dynamics. The simulation results are compared to long-term biotic data collected from 1999 to 2004. The analysis shows that enhanced nutrient supply increases the nutritious value of algae, stimulating zooplankton growth, while phytoplankton growth is limited by stronger top-down control. Annually integrated productivity is only slightly influenced by altered turbidity, as phosphorous limitation prevails. Simulations indicate that the spring production peak is delayed because of increased turbidity in winter caused by upstream hydropower operation. As a consequence, the entire nutrient cycle is seasonally delayed, creating an additional stress for zooplankton and fish in the downstream lake.					; Finger, David/AFS-6986-2022; Wuest, Alfred/L-2607-2014; Schmid, Martin/C-3953-2009	Finger, David C./0000-0003-0678-8946; Schmid, Martin/0000-0001-8699-5691													0043-1397	1944-7973				DEC 11	2007	43	12							W12404	10.1029/2007WR005868	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007WR005868													WOS:000251693900003

Uncovering Holocene climate fluctuations and ancient conifer populations: Insights from a high-resolution multi-proxy record from Northern Finland	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												A series of abrupt climate events linked to circum-North Atlantic meltwater forcing have been recognised in Holocene paleoclimate data. To address the paucity of proxy records able to characterise robustly the regional impacts of these events, we retrieved a sub-centennial resolution, well-dated core sequence from Lake Kuutsja<spacing diaeresis>rvi, northeast Finland. By analysing a range of paleo-environmental proxies (pollen, plant sedimentary ancient DNA, plant macrofossils, conifer stomata, and non-pollen palynomorphs), and supported with proxy-based paleotemperature and moisture reconstructions, we unravel a well-defined sequence of vegetation and climate dynamics over the early-to-middle Holocene. The birch-dominated pioneer vegetation stage was intersected by two transient tree-cover decrease events at 10.4 and 10.1 thousand years ago (ka), likely representing a two-pronged signal of the 10.3 ka climate event. Our data also show a clear signal of the 8.2 ka climate event, previously not well recorded in the European Arctic, with a collapse of the pine-birch forest and replacement by juniper developing in tight synchrony with Greenland isotopic proxies over 8.4-8.0 ka. Supported by climate modelling, severe winter cooling rather than summer might have been driving vegetation disruptions in the early Holocene. The Kuutsja<spacing diaeresis>rvi data indicate an early arrival of Norway spruce (Picea abies) by 9.2 ka (pollen, DNA, and stoma finds), as well as the first evidence for Holocene presence of larch (Larix) in Finland, with pollen finds dating to 9.6-5.9 ka.					; Alsos, Inger/A-9507-2016; Heintzman, Peter/I-6768-2013; Luoto, Miska/E-6693-2014; Piilo, Sanna/AAY-9144-2020; Schenk, Frederik/AAI-7824-2020	Schenk, Frederik/0000-0002-4768-9832; Luoto, Miska/0000-0001-6203-5143; Trasune, Liva/0000-0001-7843-1378; Salonen, Sakari/0000-0002-8847-9081; 													0921-8181	1872-6364				JUN	2024	237								104462	10.1016/j.gloplacha.2024.104462	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2024.104462		MAY 2024											WOS:001243548100001

SOM segregated study areas into four groups and ten subgroups. Two strikingly alternative states are frequently observed: the first is a diverse non-eutrophic state designated by three groups (SOM 1-3), and the second is a eutrophic state (SOM 4: Shihwa Lake and Upper Gyeonggi Bay; summer season) characterized by enhanced nutrients (3 mg l(-1) dissolved inorganic nitrogen, 0.1 mg l(-1) PO4) that act as a signal and response to that signal as algal blooms (24 mu g chlorophyll-a l(-1)). Bloom potential in response to nitrification is affiliated with high temperature (r = 0.26), low salinity (r = -0.40) and suspended solids (r = -0.27). Moreover, strong stratification in the Shihwa Lake has accelerated harmful algal blooms and hypoxia. The non-eutrophic states (SOM 1-3) are characterized by macro-tidal estuaries exhibiting a tolerance to pollution with nitrogen-containing nutrients and retarding any tendency toward stratification. SOM 1 (winter) is more distinct from SOM 4 due to higher suspended solids (>50 mg l(-1)) caused by resuspension that induces light limitation and low chlorophyll-a (<5 mu g l(-1)). In addition, eutrophication-induced shifts in phytoplankton communities are noticed during all the seasons in Gyeonggi Bay. Overall, SOM showed high performance for visualization and abstraction of ecological data and could serve as an efficient ecological map that can specify blooming regions and provide a comprehensive view on the eutrophication process in a macrotidal estuary.

Jean			Seasonal cycling and mass-loading of dissolved metals and sulfate discharging from an abandoned mine site in northern Canada	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Drainage from sulfide-rich mine waste can contaminate surface waters directly by surface runoff and indirectly through groundwater discharge. The Camp Lake watershed, located in northern Manitoba, receives both direct and indirect drainage from an abandoned tailings impoundment which has resulted in severely degraded water quality. Sulfide oxidation has been occurring for over 70 years at an abandoned mine site in this watershed, resulting in high concentrations of oxidation products in the surface water and groundwater discharging from the two tailings impoundments, both of which flow into the adjacent Camp Lake. A 5-year hydrological and geochemical sampling program was conducted at this small Precambrian shield lake prior to the initiation of remedial actions, to identify the seasonal distribution and mass-loading of dissolved metals and sulfate discharging from Camp Lake to the downstream Kississing Lake. Weekly and biweekly sampling of outflow from the lake clearly showed a seasonal cycle of dissolved metals, sulfate and pH. During months when the lake was ice-covered, the discharge water had a neutral pH with low concentrations of dissolved metals and sulfate similar to background concentrations. At spring melt the discharge sampled at Camp Weir revealed abrupt increases in dissolved metal and sulfate concentrations and decreases in pH to values that remained relatively constant until fall freeze-up, when dissolved metal concentrations and pH returned to winter values. The annual and interannual variations in loadings measured at Camp Weir are different from those measured at the two streams feeding Camp Lake showing the contribution of groundwater flow through the tailings to SO4 and metal loadings to the lake during dry years and the potential for significant loadings due to flushing of the thick unsaturated zone in the tailings during relatively wet years. The abrupt changes in pH, metal and sulfate concentrations and the timing of these changes with the appearance and disappearance of ice-cover on the lakes suggests a combination of physical and geochemical controls related to shifts in sources of water, mixing and changes in solubility. Despite fairly low average annual metal concentrations measured in Camp Lake discharge, concentrations of Zn and Cu were elevated above background in bottom sediments of Kississing Lake in a zone extending 9.5 km(2) from the location of Camp Lake inflow. These results show the importance of the open-water period in controlling metal discharge from mine-impacted areas, and demonstrate that even when average annual concentrations are only slightly elevated, long-term metal loadings can have a significant impact on the receiving aquatic systems.

Impact of summer cottage residence on recreational fishing participation in Finland	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												High participation in recreational fishing in Finland was explained by the tradition of families occupying summer cottages and spending leisure time close to lakes or the sea shore in summer. The characteristics of cottage dwelling fishers and other recreational fishers were compared. The summer cottage culture enhances fishing participation of urban citizens, notably children and women. Children were often introduced to fishing while dwelling in the cottages with their family. Cottage fishers favour simple angling, but catch-oriented fishing with gill nets and wire traps is also popular. Preparing meals based on the catch is an important part of Finnish cottage life, where rural traditions are mixed with the modern and urban. Summer cottage dwellers form an important group to improve local management of problems arising from intense fishing participation and divergent interests in the country.																			0969-997X					OCT	2006	13	5					275	283		10.1111/j.1365-2400.2006.00503.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2400.2006.00503.x													WOS:000240149300001

Goiter incidence in sexually precocious jacks from Lakes Ontario and Michigan was 43-45% and 100% in jacks fron Lake Erie. All fish displayed thyroid hyperplasia. The degree of hyperplasia (as indicated by thyroid follicle colloid content, thyroid follicle size and shape and thyroid follicle epithelial cell size) in Lake Ontario fish tended to be greater in the jacks than in the spring fish; the reverse was true in Lake Erie fish. Serum total L-thyroxine (T4) concentrations in Lake Ontario spring fish were higher than in any other group. There were no differences in serum T4 levels between the groups of jacks, nor were serum T4 levels in jacks and spring salmon from Lake Ontario significantly different. Serum total triiodo-thyronine (T3) concentrations in Lake Ontario spring salmon were significantly higher than in all other groups and that in Lake Erie spring salmon greater than in all groups of jacks. Serum T3 levels in Lake Ontario jacks were higher than in Lake Erie jacks. Serum free fatty acid (FFA) and cholesterol levels showed significant interlake differences with lower levels present in Lake Erie salmon. Lake Erie jacks appeared to have fewer and less well vacuolated pituitary gonadotropic basophils than jacks from Lakes Michigan and Ontario. Putative thyrotrop cells appeared to be more numerous and more active in the Lake Erie spring salmon compared with Lake Ontario spring salmon. Prolactin, corticotrop and melanotrop cells appeared less active in spring salmon than in the jacks.																				1095-8649					1981	18	6					643	653		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1981.tb03806.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1981.tb03806.x													WOS:A1981LU16100003

Average Sigma 36PCB concentrations were 3136 824 and 1371 +/- 642 pg m(-3) for summer and winter periods, respectively in the Industrial site and they were 314 +/- 129 and 847 +/- 610 pg m(-3) in the Urban site. The elemental content showed that the PM10 measured at the Industrial site was dominated by terrestrial elements and trace elements emitted by the iron-steel plants (Fe, Zn and Pb). The elemental profile at the Urban site was typical for Aegean Region that was dominated by terrestrial elements (Ca, Al, Mg) and sea salt (Na). Sources of particle-phase PCBs and trace elements were identified using factor analysis (FA) and were apportioned by chemical mass balance (CMB) model. FA suggested that the steel industry, fuel oil combustion, or the nearby vinyl chloride process in the petrochemical plant, and soil were significant PCB sources. CMB results showed that at the Industrial site, the contribution of steel industry and soil to particle-phase PCBs were 71% and 22%, respectively, while at the Urban site, the contributions were 33% and 49%, respectively. Steel industry was also the dominant contributor for trace elements around the site. Fugacity calculations in air and soil showed that the soil acts as a secondary source to the atmosphere for low molecular weight PCBs especially in summer and as a sink for the higher molecular weight ones.

The data from two decades (1994-2018) on the surface (0-3 m) ciliate assemblage in the Slapy reservoir (Vltava River, Czech Republic) during two different nutrient-load defined periods were analysed. We grouped the identified, quantified, and biomass-evaluated ciliates in the quantitative protargol-impregnated preparations according to their feeding behaviour. The sampling median and interquartile range data of the ciliates were plotted; the modelled water age, nutrients, bacteria, heterotrophic nanoflagellates, and Rhodomonas spp. were applied as the main explanatory background variables. We validated the differences between the periods, engaging multivariate analyses. The picoplankton-filtering species dominated the assemblages in an annual mean (halteriids and minute strobilidiids followed by peritrichs). Algae hunting urotrichs, Balanion planctonicum, and nanoplankton filtering tintinnids were significant before the spring phytoplankton peak when a maximum of ciliate biomass reflected mixotrophic nanoplankton filtering pelagostrombidiids. Only there did ciliate biomass tightly follow their quantified prey. Heterotrophic and mixotrophic Askenasia and Lagynophrya were typical raptorial/flagellate-hunting cilates; only Mesodinium spp. reached the maximum during autumn. The observed oligotrophication of the reservoir increased the ciliate assemblage biomass in the surface layer during stratification in concordance with the Plankton Ecology Group (PEG) model.					; Šorf, Michal/H-1330-2014; Vrba, Jaroslav/M-3780-2013; Macek, Miroslav/B-5428-2015; Sorf, Michal/H-1330-2014; Hejzlar, Josef/F-8526-2014; Rehakova, Klara/B-2143-2012; Simek, Karel/F-8930-2014	Simek, Karel/0000-0002-7058-9063; Vrba, Jaroslav/0000-0003-2145-9024; Macek, Miroslav/0000-0003-0600-3539; Hejzlar, Josef/0000-0002-7186-4776; Sorf, Michal/0000-0002-9368-6421; 														1424-2818				SEP	2024	16	9							534	10.3390/d16090534	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d16090534													WOS:001323656200001

The two abrupt cooling events detected from the Tiancai Lake record, centered at similar to 9.7 and 3.5 ka were examined respectively.

Silica Sinter and the Evolution of Hot Springs in the Alvord/Pueblo Valleys, Southeast Oregon, USA	ENERGIES												Hot springs in the Alvord/Pueblo valleys in southeastern Oregon are analogous to Basin-and-Range hydrothermal systems where heat source and permeable pathways are met through crustal thinning. Silica sinter deposition at Mickey Springs, Alvord Valley, predates the late Pleistocene high stand of pluvial Lake Alvord. At Borax Lake, Pueblo Valley, sinter deposition occurred during the Holocene. This study examines the evolution of springs at Mickey Springs, where three morphologies of sinter are present: (1) basalt clasts surrounded by sinter in interbedded conglomerate and sandstone, (2) pool-edge and aprons of sinter surrounding depressions (12-32 m diameter), and (3) quaquaversal sinter mounds with pool-edge sinter. The oldest sinter occurs in silica-cemented conglomerate and sandstone, where deposition occurred prior to 30 kya. Deposition around broad depressions and mounds occurred after 30 kya but before water levels began to rise in pluvial Lake Alvord. Thermoluminescence dates suggest sinter deposition ceased before 18 kya when silt and clay filled inactive vents and buried aprons. A few mounds hosted active springs after sinter deposition ceased but while submerged in pluvial Lake Alvord. Now, high-temperature springs, steam vents, and mud pots are concentrated in a 50 x 50 m area near the southern edge of the spring area.																				1996-1073				NOV	2021	14	21							7186	10.3390/en14217186	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14217186													WOS:000726988200001

In this work, we characterize the thermal regime of a highly regulated river located in Northern Italy, which is the emissary of Lake Maggiore. The thermal characteristics of the study reach are influenced by the presence of two dams and by climate warming. In the 15-year monitored period (1999-2013) a significant increase of the mean annual river temperature (i.e., -1.8 degrees C) was indeed recorded. Minimum and maximum water temperatures were detected in correspondence of low-flow periods in February and August, respectively. During August the temperature reached a maximum of 27 degrees C, that is a value below the upper thermal limit of tolerance for most of the aquatic taxa collected in the study area. Moreover, the local presence of seeps and the interaction with groundwater play an important ecological role by guaranteeing patches of cool water to the aquatic communities. Nevertheless, the sensitive early life stages of fish species that spawn in spring/summer may be affected by the high summer temperatures and the expected future climate warming. The wider range of temperatures preferred by alien fish species could result into a competitive disadvantage for autochthonous species. The current minimum flows established by local laws as environmental flows appeared to be able to guarantee an acceptable thermal alteration in morphologically heterogeneous reaches where river/groundwater interaction occurred, at least within the current climatic conditions.					; Quadroni, Silvia/T-1972-2019	Quadroni, Silvia/0000-0003-1295-2108; 													1129-5767	1723-8633					2017	76	1					23	33		10.4081/jlimnol.2016.1437	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2016.1437													WOS:000396708700003

Summer warmth of the past six interglacials on Greenland	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												The relative warmth of mid-to-late Pleistocene interglacials on Greenland has remained unknown, leading to debates about the regional climate forcing that caused past retreat of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS). We analyze the hydrogen isotopic composition of terrestrial biomarkers in Labrador Sea sediments through interglacials of the past 600,000 y to infer millennial-scale summer warmth on southern Greenland. Here, we reconstruct exceptionally warm summers in Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e, concurrent with strong Northern Hemisphere summer insolation. In contrast, "superinterglacial" MIS11 demonstrated only moderate warmth, sustained throughout a prolonged interval of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide. Strong inferred GrIS retreat during MIS11 relative to MIS5e suggests an indirect relationship between maximum summer temperature and cumulative interglacial mass loss, indicating strong GrIS sensitivity to duration of regional warmth and elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide.

Radiophosphate was incorporated into bacteria and microphytoplankton (< 10 .mu.m in diameter) with minutes of introduction. Thereafter, the bulk of 32P exchange was between the microplankton, which typically held < 90% of 32P, dissolved phosphate, and a mobile subcompartment of "dissolved organic" phosphorus. Phytoplankton > 10 .mu.m in diameter and zooplankton acquired 32P label very slowly and contained < 5% of the radiotracer. In addition, about half of dissolved organic phosphorus failed to acquire a 32P label over 17 d of incubation, indicating that this phosphorus may be functionally inert, at least at the time scale of biological phosphorus exchange. Movement of 32P to the littoral zone of Lake 227 was much slower than in lakes with well-developed macrophyte communities, but losses to deep sediments were similar, about 2% of 32P per day. Particles settled through the hypolimnion at a modal velocity of 28 cm .cntdot. d-1, losing 10% or less of their 32P during descent. Most of the released phosphorus was reincorporated into particles and sedimented. Less than 1% of the 32P that entered the hypolimnion in particles between August and October remained in the hypolimnion in late October. 32P release from Lake 227''s hypolimnetic sediments during late summer and fall of 1978 was < 5% of the 32P that sedimented.

A Microhistological Investigation of Winter Diets of White- tailed Deer in Relict Eastern Hemlock Stands, Upper Peninsula of Michigan	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												To better understand winter foraging patterns of Odocoileus virginianus ( White- tailed Deer) in the context of global change, we assessed foraging trends using microhistological analysis of fecal pellets from 2006-2018 across a network of monitoring plots in 39 relict Tsuga canadensis (Eastern Hemlock) stands in the western Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We found that deciduous browse comprised the majority of the diet, but conifer species were also eaten. During severe winters, Eastern Hemlock and Abies balsamea (Balsam Fir) were more prevalent in the diet, whereas in mild winters, Thuja occidentalis (Northern White Cedar) was more prevalent. Because Northern White Cedar comprises only a small amount of the forest community in these stands, deer were likely traveling beyond these winter yarding areas to forage. The relationship between conifer consumption and winter severity highlights the importance of energy conservation for winter survival of White- tailed Deer. More extreme winter weather is predicted with climate change, potentially prolonging confinement and limited forage availability, which is liable to alter energy budgets of deer, thus potentially altering population dynamics.																			1092-6194	1938-5307				AUG	2021	28	3					296	310		10.1656/045.028.0305	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/045.028.0305													WOS:000699898200006

Earlier onset of the spring phytoplankton bloom in lakes of the temperate zone in a warmer climate	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												The decoupling of trophic interactions is potentially one of the most severe consequences of climate warming. In lakes and oceans the timing of phytoplankton blooms affects competition within the plankton community as well as food-web interactions with zooplankton and fish. Using Upper Lake Constance as an example, we present a model-based analysis that predicts that in a future warmer climate, the onset of the spring phytoplankton bloom will occur earlier in the year than it does at present. This is a result of the earlier occurrence of the transition from strong to weak vertical mixing in spring, and of the associated earlier onset of stratification. According to our simulations a shift in the timing of phytoplankton growth resulting from a consistently warmer climate will exceed that resulting from a single unusually warm year. The numerical simulations are complemented by a statistical analysis of long-term data from Upper Lake Constance which demonstrates that oligotrophication has a negligible effect on the timing of phytoplankton growth in spring and that an early onset of the spring phytoplankton bloom is associated with high air temperatures and low wind speeds.

The influence of a storage lake in the Arid Elqui Valley in Chile on local climate	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												High-resolution model simulations were performed with the quadruple-nested version of the mesoscale model KAMM to investigate the impact of the new storage lake 'Embalse Puclaro' on the arid environment. The storage lake covers an area of 1 to 2km in width and about 7km in length. Model simulations were performed for a summer and a winter day. Due to a change in the surface properties, the installation of the storage lake resulted in a modification of the energy balance. Above the lake area, a stably stratified atmosphere establishes during the day and unstable stratification during the night. During the day, the latent heat flux is similar to that of the replaced cultivated ground, but is higher at the night. The influence of the storage lake on temperature and humidity can be seen to a height of about 300m above ground level. During the night, water vapour accumulation results in relative humidity values of 100%, as a result a greater number of days with fog above the storage lake is likely when compared to the surrounding area. The storage lake does not produce its own lake breeze during the day, because the larger-scale up-valley wind is too dominant. However, a significant modification of the nocturnal down-valley wind above the lake area can be observed, especially in summer. As a consequence of the larger-scale valley wind system, the influence of the storage lake on the temperature, humidity, and wind field can be identified up to about 4km on the downwind side.

J	Hargeby, A; Jonzén, N; Blindow, I				Hargeby, Anders; Jonzen, Niclas; Blindow, Irmgard			Does a long-term oscillation in nitrogen concentration reflect climate impact on submerged vegetation and vulnerability to state shifts in a shallow lake?	OIKOS												Various ecosystems, including shallow lakes, are suggested to possess alternative stable state dynamics. The response of such systems to environmental change is non-linear and not fully reversible, which calls for identification of feedback mechanisms and subtle changes connected to structural stability. Here, we used a 25-year data series on water chemistry to make inferences on processes prior to a recent shift from a clear to a turbid state in Lake Takern, Sweden. Before the shift, annual concentration of total organic nitrogen (TON) described a cyclic pattern, with a periodicity of eight years. Annual TON was negatively correlated with the magnitude of a summer decline in calcium carbonate, treated as a proxy of the seasonal production of submerged vegetation. Cross-correlations of TON and the north Atlantic oscillation (NAO) indicated a possible connection to climate. The strongest correlation was obtained by a three-year lag of the NAO index. Using a set of linear time series models, the most parsimonious model was a 3(rd) order autoregressive model with NAO, delayed three years, as a covariate. Analyses of seasonality indicated that the delayed NAO signal was strongly correlated with summer TON. Also, the autocorrelation function was very similar for these two time series, and autoregressive models including NAO as a covariate were strongly supported (sum of Akaike weights = 0.93). These results indicate that climate may have contributed to the regime shift through lowered macrophyte production at the time of the shift, and therefore most likely also a depleted resilience of the clear water state. The delayed effect of climate is suggested to result from indirect and inter-year dependent response of submerged vegetation to fish kills during harsh winters.																			0030-1299	1600-0706				NOV	2006	115	2					334	348		10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.14717.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.14717.x													WOS:000241198800013

Paijanne was studied by electric fishing on four occasions during 1988-1989. Ten fish species and 1681 individuals (14.5 kg) were caught in the 15 fishing sites (4096 m2) Which gives a mean density of 0.41 ind. m-2 and biomass of 3.5 g m-2. Effluent from two large paper mills causes a clear zonation of the fish fauna in the area. In the most polluted shores, only burbot and perch occurred regularly and the reproduction of other species was inhibited. In the semipolluted area (5-15 km from the Kaipola paper mill), burbot and stone loach occurred regularly, but owing to low numbers of perch and bullhead the total densities were usually low. The 'clean' shores were characterized by an abundance of stone loach and bullhead and locally also of minnow, which seemed to be very sensitive to pollution. The strong floods during summer 1988 had positive effects on the reproduction of perch and pike, but the densities of other species were highest during the 'normal' water level in autumn 1989.																			0018-8158					OCT 2	1992	243						413	420		10.1007/BF00007058	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007058													WOS:A1992JZ96300044

Water samples sterilized by microfiltration were never proteolytic. In situ proteolysis was very dependent on water temperature (1-23.degree. C). No measurable activity was observed below 4.degree. C. The in vitro proteolysis rate at 20.degree. C was 2.3 times the rate at 15.degree. C and 6 times the rate at 10.degree. C. Water taken from beneath the ice-covered lake throughout the winter and tested in the laboratory at 20.degree. C showed an increasing proteolytic potential during the winter months. The highest activity was obtained as the ice broke up in early spring. Microbiological proteolysis in water from Burlington Harbor [Vermont, USA] was often 4 times that found in center lake water. In most experiments proteolysis was inhibited completely by 2 .mu.g of Cu2+ and inhibited 67% by 0.75 .mu.g/ml. Proteolysis was markedly stimulated by 20-40 .mu.g of Casitone or Casamino Acids/ml. The predominant bacteria growing in the proteolysis flasks were species of Pseudomonas and Flavobacterium. Pure cultures of Pseudomonas required traces of Casitone, Casamino Acids or yeast extract for proteolysis of hide powder azure, whereas those of Flavobacterium did not. The requirement could not be met by a mixture of 21 amino acids and 8 vitamins.																			0099-2240	1098-5336					1979	37	5					900	908		10.1128/AEM.37.5.900-908.1979	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.37.5.900-908.1979								16345387					WOS:A1979GV99600020

The samples were gathered from six sites distributed equally along the northern and southern parts of this lake. The present study indicated that, water N, P, Ca and Mg concentrations of the southern sites were higher than those of the northern sites. Shoot height, stem diameter, number of leaves, flowering ratio, leaf area, and leaf area index (LAI) were significantly lower in young populations compared with old populations. However, shoot density was significantly higher in young populations compared with old populations. The above-ground biomass increased from February until it reached its maximum during August and then decreased again, while a decrease in below-ground biomass in spring to support the rapid shoot growth, followed by an increase in summer due to the shoot translocations in the reverse direction was indicated. The CR (common reed) exhibited a slower relative growth rate (RGR) during cooler months, September?December, while highest RGR was achieved during spring months, March?May. In Lake Burullus the results from this field work indicated that shoot height, stem diameter, number of leaves, flowering ratio, leaf area, LAI, and biomass of CR increased with increasing nutrients along north-south direction in Lake Burullus, where lake eutrophication influenced CR growth positively. Thus, the theory that the biomass and morphology of this macrophyte is determined by the water trophic content is reinforced. The collection of this data is valuable to further comprehend the growth cycle of CR and to contribute to the future management and utilization of CR in the Egyptian wetlands.

Archaeal and bacterial communities in three alkaline hot springs in Heart Lake Geyser Basin, Yellowstone National Park	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												The Heart Lake Geyser Basin (HLGB) is remotely located at the base of Mount Sheridan in southern Yellowstone National Park (YNP), Wyoming, USA and is situated along Witch Creek and the northwestern shore of Heart Lake. Likely because of its location, little is known about the microbial community structure of springs in the HLGB. Bacterial and archaeal populations were monitored via small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene pyrosequencing over 3 years in 3 alkaline (pH 8.5) hot springs with varying temperatures (44 degrees C, 63 degrees C, 75 degrees C). The bacterial populations were generally stable over time, but varied by temperature. The dominant bacterial community changed from moderately thermophilic and photosynthetic members (Cyanobacteria and Chloroflexi) at 44 degrees C to a mixed photosynthetic and thermophilic community (Deinococcus-Thermus) at 63 degrees C and a non-photosynthetic thermophilic community at 75 degrees C. The archaeal community was more variable across time and was predominantly a methanogenic community in the 44 and 63 degrees C springs and a thermophilic community in the 75 degrees C spring. The 75 degrees C spring demonstrated large shifts in the archaeal populations and was predominantly Candidatus Nitrosocaldus, an ammonia-oxidizing crenarchaeote, in the 2007 sample, and almost exclusively Thermofilum or Candidatus Caldiarchaeum in the 2009 sample, depending on SSU rRNA gene region examined. The majority of sequences were dissimilar (>= 10% different) to any known organisms suggesting that HLGB possesses numerous new phylogenetic groups that warrant cultivation efforts.

Temperate reservoirs are large carbon sinks and small CO2 sources: Results from high-resolution carbon budgets	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Sediment organic carbon (C) burial and CO2 fluxes in inland waters are quantitatively important in regional and global carbon budgets. Estimates of C fluxes from inland waters are typically based on limited temporal resolution despite potential large variations with season and weather events. Further, most freshwater C budget studies have focused on natural soft-water lakes, while reservoirs and hard-water systems are globally numerous. Our study quantifies C fluxes in two hard-water, human constructed reservoirs (Ohio, USA) of contrasting watershed land use (agriculture vs. forest) using high-resolution mass balance budgets. We show that during a dry summer, C retention and export via the dam were reduced compared to a wet summer. Both reservoirs were net CO2 sources during a wet summer, but CO2 sinks during a dry summer. Despite weather-related summer differences, annual C fluxes within each reservoir were similar between years. Both reservoirs appear to be net autotrophic despite often being CO2 sources based on budgets. This is likely because CO2 fluxes in our hard-water reservoirs were more strongly associated with DIC than DOC. Using our C fluxes and statewide watershed land use, we determined the regional importance of Ohio reservoirs in OC burial and CO2 emissions. We estimate that Ohio reservoirs bury up to 4 times more OC, but emit <25% of CO2, than predicted based on their area and recent global mean estimates in lentic ecosystems. Our results provide evidence that moderately old (similar to 50 years), temperate hard-water reservoirs are important OC sinks but contribute little to CO2 emissions.

As a response, invertebrate communities could be altered, and 'novel' trophic communities could develop. Lake Constance (Europe) experienced pronounced nutrient variation caused by cultural eutrophication (prior 1980s) and oligotrophication (post-1980) and experienced many neobiota invasions. We used archived samples to investigate the impact of oligotrophication and invasive species on carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures of littoral macroinvertebrates during spring and autumn periods from 2000 to 2015 and of littoral fish species in 2018. Isotopic signatures of invertebrate and fish species were in the same range and showed similar seasonal differences and clear patterns in respect to littoral vs pelagic food sources and trophic level. Oligotrophication did not strongly alter isotopic values and only delta N-15 values of invertebrates declined weakly with oligotrophication. In contrast, interannual variability of stable isotope signatures was related to abundances of the invasive Dreissena polymorpha suggesting interannual differences in the importance of benthic-pelagic coupling due to Dreissena pseudofaeces for the nutrition of littoral invertebrates.

We provide a definition for ecohydrogeology as "a unifying, synthetic field of study integrating the approaches from the ecological and hydrogeological sciences in the study of groundwater (GW)-related ecosystems, habitats, and organisms to advance science, stewardship, and policy". We selected specific case studies to illustrate first how hydrogeological approaches can favour in-depth understanding and modelling of springs and crenobiontic (spring-dependent) species distribution, assemblage composition and organization. Second, this essay also examines how taxa and assemblages serve as bioassays and ecosystem indicators to infer hydrogeological aspects of GW flow and discharge, as well as quantitative and qualitative human impacts. We consider both types of features and parameters as ecohydrogeological indicators. The examples presented include topics related to springs and other GDE geomorphological types and classification, GW quality influences on crenobiont distribution, phreatophyte (= plant species the roots of which reach to and into the water table) ecophysiology in relation to water table depth, and flow variability in karstic systems, to nutrient dynamics in relation to dinoflagellate blooms in GDE montane lakes. Conceptual approaches that integrate ecology with hydrogeology include the investigation of GDE distribution and ecology, groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) interactions, and the development of the discipline of ecohydrology. Despite widespread applications, the scientific community still lacks a complete or effective integration of the principles described in the fields of groundwater hydrogeology with ecology, ecophysiology, and environmental biology. Springs are aquatic-wetland-riparian habitats that link shallow subsurface-surface processes and assemblages, often functioning as biodiversity hotspots, ecotones, keystone, and refugial ecosystems, for which coordination between studies of hydrogeology and ecology are both obvious and essential. Over the past century, springs ecosystem ecology has been largely ignored by hydrologists, and, conversely, hydrogeology has been under-emphasized by ecologists. Recent global recognition of the extraordinary biodiversity and socio-cultural significance of springs, coupled with their globally highly threatened conservation status, stimulated this inquiry into how to better integrate hydrogeology with springs ecosystem ecology. Acknowledging the highly threatened status of springs ecosystems around the world, there is an urgent need to integrate and invigorate the union of these disciplines into ecohydrogeology, the study of groundwater-dependent organisms, habitats, ecosystems, and management policy.					; Cantonati, Marco/G-4278-2018; Filippini, Maria/AAW-1358-2020; Ogata, Kei/P-3125-2016; Goldscheider, Nico/HKN-3715-2023; Ogata, Kei/I-8150-2014	Filippini, Maria/0000-0001-5050-5072; Gargini, Alessandro/0000-0002-9271-219X; segadelli, stefano/0000-0001-5260-6256; Cantonati, Marco/0000-0003-0179-3842; Ogata, Kei/0000-0002-4978-2854													1470-160X	1872-7034				MAR	2020	110								105803	10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105803	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105803													WOS:000507381800007

Distribution of barren-ground caribou during winter in response to fire	ECOSPHERE												We investigated the influence of past fires on the large-scale distribution of barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus) in the Northwest Territories, Canada, during winter. We used an information-theoretic approach and data describing fire history, vegetation, and predation risk to develop resource selection functions that explained caribou distribution on early-and late-winter ranges. We evaluated multiple sets of models constructed across years for all caribou (pooled models) and for individual caribou by period (early and late winter). Winter range habitats important to caribou were characterized by a high percentage of ground cover of lichen and herbaceous forage and a close proximity to lakes and rivers. Although caribou avoided areas densely populated with burns, there was considerable use of early-seral habitats as well as areas adjacent to the burn boundary. Disparate selection strategies among caribou highlight the importance of investigating both individual and global resource selection models. These results suggest that at some spatial and temporal scales, individual barren-ground caribou may be less averse to fire than previously thought.																			2150-8925					OCT	2014	5	10							140	10.1890/ES14-00010.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/ES14-00010.1													WOS:000345097200018
J	Smith, JR; Giegengack, R; Schwarcz, HP				Smith, JR; Giegengack, R; Schwarcz, HP			Constraints on Pleistocene pluvial climates through stable-isotope analysis of fossil-spring tufas and associated gastropods, Kharga Oasis, Egypt	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Stable-isotope analyses of fossil-spring carbonates (tufas) and freshwater gastropods (Melanoides tuberculata) from the currently hyperarid Western Desert of Egypt indicate that this region received enough precipitation to support a small perennial lake during the height of the oxygen-isotope stage 6/5e pluvial event, and a substantial volume of spring discharge during prior pluvial phases. Tufa and gastropod oxygen-isotope ratios are generally low relative to modem precipitation in the region, confirming that the majority of Pleistocene pluvial precipitation came from an Atlantic source, as determined by previous workers. Mean tufa delta(13)C ( - 2parts per thousand PDB) suggests a significant proportion of C4 vegetation in the recharge area of the tufa-depositing springs, while the paucity of tufas with delta(13)C greater than 0parts per thousand suggests that equilibrium between spring water and atmospheric CO2 represented an endpoint for the evolution of spring water carbon. Though spring carbonate deposition requires a substantial increase in humidity in central Egypt relative to modem conditions, high variation in tufa delta(13)O (up to 4parts per thousand within individual stratigraphic units), as well as positive covariance between tufa carbon- and oxygen-isotope ratios, reflect significant effects of evaporation on spring water during tufa formation. Similarity in delta(18)O and delta(13)C values of tufas from different stratigraphic units indicates that climatic conditions did not vary significantly among pluvial phases recorded by spring-carbonate deposition. The lack of substantial carbonate formation at tufa localities during the Holocene pluvial phase, however, suggests that tufa deposition represents substantially wetter conditions than have existed during Holocene time.

This study addresses this gap by investigating bloom dynamics in the eutrophic Majiagou River (Harbin, China) through phytoplankton resource use efficiency (RUE), calculated as chlorophyll-a per unit TN/TP. Seasonal sampling (2022-2024) across 25 rural-to-urban sites revealed distinct spatiotemporal patterns: urban sections exhibited 1.9x higher cyanobacterial relative abundance (RAC, peaking at 40.65% in autumn) but 28-30% lower RUE than rural areas. Generalized additive models identified nonlinear RAC-RUE relationships with critical thresholds: in rural sections, RAC peaked at TN-RUE 40-45 and TP-RUE 25-30, whereas urban sections showed lower TN-RUE triggers (20-25) and suppressed dominance above TP-RUE 10. Seasonal extremes drove RUE maxima in summer and minima during freezing/thawing periods. These findings demonstrate that hydrological stagnation (e.g., river mouths) and pulsed nutrient inputs reduce nutrient conversion efficiency while lowering bloom-triggering thresholds under urban eutrophication. The study establishes RUE as a predictive indicator for bloom risk, advocating optimized N/P ratios coupled with flow restoration rather than mere nutrient reduction. This approach provides a science-based framework for sustainable management of urban river ecosystems facing climate and anthropogenic pressures.																				2076-2607				AUG 25	2025	13	9							1981	10.3390/microorganisms13091981	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms13091981								41011315					WOS:001580650700001

Storminess variation during the last 6500 years as reconstructed from an ombrotrophic peat bog in Halland, southwest Sweden	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Cores taken from an ombrotrophic peat bog in the coastal zone of Halland, southwest Sweden, were examined for wind transported mineral grains, pollen and humidity indicators. The core covers the period from 6500 cal. yr BP to present. Ombrotrophic conditions existed from ca. 4200 cal. yr BP onwards. Bog surface wetness fluctuated strongly until ca. 3700 cal. yr BP, with an apparent dominance of dry summer conditions from 4800-4500 cal. yr BP. Local wet shifts occurred around 4300, 2800, 2400 and 1500 cal. yr BP, whereas the most recent 600 years of the record show increasingly dry conditions. Mineral grain content, interpreted as aeolian sand influx (ASI), was used as a proxy for (winter) storm frequency and intensity until ca. 1500 cal. yr BP, after which increasing human impact, as reconstructed by pollen analysis, became a second important potential cause for increased sand drift. Strongly increased storminess occurred at 4800, 4200, 2800-2200, 1500, 1100 and 400-50 cal. yr BP, indicating a dominance of cold and stormy winters during these periods. Many of these storm periods apparently coincide with storm events in other sites in southwestern Scandinavia, suggesting that our ASI record reflects a regional scale climatic signal. Furthermore these stormy periods correlate to well-known cold phases in the North Atlantic region, suggesting a link to large-scale fluctuations in atmospheric circulation patterns.

Weekly samples for 1995 have been analysed using the PEG model approach. In winter, light was the main factor controlling phytoplankton growth. In early spring phytoplankton was mainly resource-controlled, competition for phosphorus being the main driving force. Ciliates (Paradileptus sp., Strobilidium sp. and Vorticella sp.) were the first herbivores which started to increase in April causing a twofold decline of phytoplankton biomass. The annual maximum of primary production (PP) in early May was probably caused by soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), regenerated by herbivores, and stirred up from bottom sediments as a result of strong wind stress. This primary production peak provided substrate for further increase of bacterial biomass. The more abundant food supply supported the development of the second spring peak of herbivores (ciliates, rotifers, juvenile copepods) which was followed by the second modest "clear water phase" in late May. Silicon was depleted by the end of May causing a strong decrease in primary production of the diatom-dominated community, whereas the biomass of the cyanophytes increased under the improved nutrient conditions. Some weeks later, inorganic N was depleted and the period of N limitation with the appearance of N-fixing cyanophytes began. The ciliate collapse at the beginning of June coincided with the start of the cladoceran development and with the increase of other metazooplankton groups. This explains the further decrease of the biomass of phytoplankton and bacteria in spite of their high production. Beginning from late June, silicon appeared again and SRP started to occur periodically, while inorganic N remained close to zero until November. During this period, phytoplankton development relied to a gear extent on the N-fixation and N-regeneration potential. The collapse of the ciliate community in September removed the top-down control from bacteria and their biomass increased, while the development of cladocerans still suppressed phytoplankton biomass in spite of a quite high PP. In October phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll a (Chla) increased, SRP was completely depleted by the middle of October reflecting a slow regeneration due to the declined activity of zooplankton in cold water. In November nitrates appeared again, and silicon reached the same level as in spring. The biomass of N-fixing Aphanizomenon skujae decreased while Limnothrix redekei and L. planctonica were quite abundant together with diatoms.

It also includes the contribution effect of the contract on the optional Choice of Paddy Field Management (CPFM) program to sustain biodiversity of winter migrants in Korea. The CPFM program has been practiced to attract winter migratory birds in cooperation with the farmers who spread rice straw, cultivate barley and provide shallow flooding paddy during the winter season in various reclaimed areas. The study result shows that a large number of winter migratory birds visited the tidal reclamation areas and the reason given is that wave intrusion was prevented by the sea dike and water level changes in the lake are less than tidal level changes in the estuary, as well as the irrigated paddy field supply of food and shelter for the birds in the reclaimed area. In the tidal reclamation area, the dominant species are waterfowl such as geese and ducks, while waders, shore birds and other small birds have declined after reclamation in the area, as the freshwater lakes are rather deeper than coastal shorelines to attract them. In conclusion, tidal areas with large paddy fields and freshwater lakes have allowed not only an increase in food production but also have attracted winter migrants supported by farmers and government; however, more effort will be needed to provide habitats for rare and distinctive birds in the reclamation area.

To elucidate the long-term dynamics of biological productivity in the Coastal Oyashio (CO), which is a major pathway for transporting dissolved iron into the western North Pacific from winter to spring, we reconstructed the lower trophic level productivity over the last 3000 years in the CO. Our results demonstrate that the concentrations and mass accumulation rates of both Chl-a (chlorophyll a and its derivatives) and biogenic opal used as proxies of primary productivity, and steryl chlorin esters (SCEs) used as that of zooplankton productivity, show a millennial-scale increasing trend and centennial-scale variability beginning ca. AD 400. SCEs were positively correlated with Chl-a, indicating that changes in zooplankton productivity were induced by bottom-up control of primary productivity. The Chl-a and SCEs showed synchronous centennial-scale patterns with a relative abundance of sea-ice-associated diatom species transported by CO, and with a ventilation index in the Okhotsk Sea Intermediate Water. This synchronous pattern indicates that lower trophic-level productivity during the spring bloom responded to the intensity of iron-replete CO.

The study area, located in the southwest of Turkey and comprised of Koycegiz Lake, Dalyan Channel and Fethiye-Gocek Bay, was scanned by measuring temperatures horizontally, 2-3 m above the bottom of the lake or sea. After analyzing the temperature data along the grids, the locations with anomalous temperature values were detected, and divers headed here for further verification. Accordingly, among these anomalies, the divers confirmed seven of them as subaqueous hot springs. Three of these hot springs are located in the Koycegiz Lake, three of them are located in the Dalyan Channel and one hot spring is located in the Fethiye-Gocek Bay. At the locations where temperature anomalies were detected, the divers collected samples directly from the subaqueous hot spring using a syringe -type sampler. We evaluated these water samples together with samples collected from hot and cold springs on land and from local rivers, lakes and the sea, with an aim to generate a conceptual hydrogeochemical model of the geothermal system in the study area. This model predicts that rainwater precipitating in the highlands percolates through fractures and faults into the deeper parts of the Earth's crust, here it is heated and ascends through the sea bottom via buried faults. Pervious carbonate nappes that are underlain and overlain by impervious rocks create a confined aquifer. The southern boundary of the Carbonate-Marmaris nappes is buried under alluvium and/or sea/lake water bodies and this phenomenon determines whether hot springs occur on land or subaqueous. The chemical and isotopic properties of the hot springs point to seawater mixing at deep levels. Thus, the mixing most probably occurs while the water is ascending through the faults and fractures. The gas geochemistry results reveal that the lowest mantle He contributions occur in the samples from Koycegiz Lake, whereas the highest ones are found in samples from the Dalaman plain. For the first time, we made use of the micro-XRF sediment core scanning (ITRAX Scanner) for exploring the relation between subaqueous geothermal occurrence and chemical properties of the surrounding sediments. The spatial elemental distribution of sea/lake bottom sediments suggests that depending on the surrounding rock units and the temperature of the hot spring, the sediments around the spring can be enriched with certain elements.

Sampling along transects was carried out at three sites in southern Brazil and four sites along the Rio de Janeiro lagoon system. The SaiGua 6 fluvial-estuarine point bar that divides the states of Santa Catarina and Parana, and the Capinzal and Veiga islands at the ancient flood tidal delta of the Guaratuba Bay, were sampled during two summers for a total of 42 samples. In the state of Rio de Janeiro, the seaward borders of the Urussanga, Boqueirao and Fora lagoons, which comprise the incipient brackish mangroves of the Saquarema Lagoon system, were sampled in both summer and winter for a total of 17 samples. Three samples were collected during the summer at the freshwater marsh of Jacarepia Lake. These coastal sedimentary environments differ in latitude, climate, physio-chemical conditions, vegetation, and sediment type. Altitude, rate of sediment transport and salinity influence the distribution of three faunal zones: higher, middle, and lower. Statistics on the dead foraminiferal distribution and ecological indications given by live occurrences showed that Haplophragmoides sp. is the dominant species at the uppermost stations (higher high water-HHW, with a 6cm vertical range) in both Guaratuba and Rio de Janeiro transects, whereas Trochammina inflata dominates the southernmost Sai-Guacu site. The Haplophragmoides-Trochammina association was also the most consistent in both dead and live HHW assemblages. Trochammina inflata and two forms of T macrescens were found to be salinity-sensitive HHW assemblages, as were Polysaccammina hyperhalina and Miliammina fusca in the Guaratuba intertidal zone. In Saquarema, the intertidal zone is marked by T macrescens, and Centropyxis aculeata predominates in Jacarepii. The subtidal zone in Parana contains Arenoparrella mexicana, Tiphotrocha comprimata, Trochammina macrescens f. macrescens, and Difflugia oblonga, whereas in Rio de Janeiro, T macrescens f. polystoma predominates.

J	Misra, P; Tandon, SK; Sinha, R				Misra, Pavani; Tandon, S. K.; Sinha, Rajiv			Holocene climate records from lake sediments in India: Assessment of coherence across climate zones	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Holocene lake records constitute an important archive for the reconstruction of paleoclimate. Despite the overall climatic stability of the Holocene, the monsoons in India, both summer, and winter, show various episodes of weakening and strengthening during this time interval. As the Holocene lake records are distributed across the various geomorphic and climatic zones of India, they offer the possibility of understanding regional scale variations in terms of both qualitative and quantitative assessment of the available proxy data. The present-day precipitation in India varies from < 200 to similar to 3800 mm (IMD), and the climate changes from arid to humid generally from west to east. The compiled lake records were aggregated into eight different zones based on their climatic and geomorphic settings. Data has been compiled from 76 lake records from India and then classified as per the various geomorphic-climatic zones of the country. The multiple lake proxies indicate fluctuating lake levels throughout the Holocene and also show regional scale coherence for specific climatic events. A majority of the records witness a peak in monsoon strength between 9 and 5 kyr BP, corresponding to the globally recorded warm and wet period of the Holocene Climate Optima. After 4 kyr BP, a general trend in aridity is recorded throughout India. This assessment shows that 17 lake records have a reasonable stratigraphic resolution, and only 9 other lake records provide paleoclimate information for a duration extending more than 8 kyr. This study also emphasizes the importance of assessing the sensitivity of the lakes with respect to their geomorphic climatic settings. We suggest that several sites across the different geomorphic-climatic zones should be reoccupied to generate high fidelity records with a stronger chronological framework to strengthen the Holocene climatic reconstructions of the Indian sub-continent.

Here, we analyse a data set comprised of field measurements of physicochemical and biological variables in Lake Bourget covering the period from 2004 to 2011 and complement this data set with laboratory experiments, to gain an understanding of the changes in phytoplankton community structure during recent years and drivers of these changes. Between 1995 and 2008, Lake Bourget was characterised by the proliferation of the red-coloured filamentous and toxic cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens, comprising 34.1-52.6% of the total phytoplanktonic biomass between 2004 and 2008. In 2009, although the contribution of P.rubescens to the total biomass was still considerable (25.3%), it was significantly lower (P<0.05) compared with previous years. The cyanobacterium disappeared completely during the autumn to winter transition of 2009/2010 and has not been recorded since this time. Concomitantly, total phytoplanktonic biomass declined sharply and a new phytoplanktonic community occurred consisting predominantly of mixotrophic genera, such as Dinobryon spp., Rhodomonas, Cryptomonas and a variety of different diatoms such as Stephanodiscus, Cyclotella and Fragilaria. Our findings suggest declines in phosphorus concentration as a key variable in bloom termination, although a number of other factors could also be important, such as temperature-dependent water column mixing, light availability, zooplankton grazing and seasonal cyanobacterial inoculums.

Our studies were conducted during the summer and autumn months of three years - 2004-2006. The paper presents results on the phytoplankton abundance (numbers, biomass and carbon content) in combination with the indices of species diversity, evenness and dominance. Phytoplankton abundance was extremely high (average values of 1135 x 10(6) cells/L for the quantity and of 46mg/L for the biomass) and increased in the end of the studied period (years 2005-2006), when decrease of species diversity and increase of the dominance index values were detected. The carbon content of the phytoplankton was at an average value of 9.7mg/L and also increased from 2004 to 2006. Cyanoprokaryota dominated in the formation of the total carbon content of the phytoplankton, in its numbers (88%-97.8%), and in the biomass (62%-87.9%). All data on phytoplankton abundance and structural parameters in Vaya confirm the hypertrophic status of the lake and reflect the general negative trend in its development.

Ornithologists have reported on wintering waterbirds in the floodplain since the 1950s. However, an integrated analysis of the long-term changes in waterbird diversity is not available. Here, we synthesise existing information on changes in wintering waterbird abundance and distribution in the floodplain, summarise possible influencing factors and propose some priorities for further research. Waterbird richness and abundance have declined over the past 60 years. Declining trends have been observed in a number of areas and species. Nevertheless, a few areas and species showed different trends. In addition, waterbirds have become more concentrated in a few suitable areas such as Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake. Land reclamation, hunting, dam operation and extensive aquaculture are probably the four major threats to wintering waterbirds, while establishment of nature reserves is beneficial to waterbird conservation. Our study suggests that waterbirds in the floodplain are vulnerable, and that effective conservation measures are needed to protect and restore the waterbird diversity of this area.

Martin; Henn, Brian			Freezing Level Forecast Error Can Consume Reservoir Flood Control Storage: Potentials for Lake Oroville and New Bullards Bar Reservoirs in California	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The atmospheric freezing level (Z(FL)) determines the rain-snow transition zone at the surface, how much rainfall is available for runoff, and the flood risk during a precipitation event. An accurate Z(FL) forecast is thus critical for reservoir operation, especially in mountain watersheds with narrow elevation bands like the Feather and North Fork Yuba in California, where a 500-m elevation gain can amount to > 50% of the watershed area. Using a 350-m Z(FL) forecast error, we find inflow volume uncertainties of < 10% to > 50% of the flood pool storages at Lake Oroville and New Bullards Bar reservoirs, depending on the Z(FL), antecedent moisture condition, and the precipitation event magnitude. The uncertainties can increase by up to > 3% per inch (25.4 mm) of precipitation, depending on the Z(FL) and antecedent moisture condition. This result substantiates the significant impact of Z(FL) forecast error and the critical need of Z(FL) forecast accuracy to support reservoir flood control operations in the two watersheds. Plain Language Summary How much rain falls over California's Sierra Nevada mountains during winter storms is influenced by the atmospheric freezing level. Above this level, air temperature is below freezing, and precipitation falls as snow. Below this level, precipitation generally falls as rain. Thus, freezing level forecasts are critical for reservoir operation, particularly flood control, which must account for the fraction of event precipitation that will become runoff and that which will contribute to snowpack. However, as with all weather forecast products, freezing level prediction carries errors and uncertainties. In this study, we evaluate how sensitive the flood control storages of Lake Oroville and New Bullards Bar reservoirs are to the magnitude of freezing level forecast error. We find that even a conservative forecast error estimate of 350 m can result in the uncertainties of rainfall-runoff estimates that exceed half of either reservoirs' flood control capacity during heavy precipitation events. This result emphasizes the impact of freezing level forecast uncertainty on reservoir operations and the importance of reducing these forecast errors.

We use satellite remote sensing, historical observations and in situ data to follow the different stages of warm and cold anticyclonic eddy generation before and after vertical overturn; an aspect that has received little attention in previous works. Thermal satellite images for 1998-2022 indicate a stable repeating seasonal pattern which is classified into stage of eddy generation and development. Field observations complement satellite imagery to characterize the vertical structure of the eddies. The main source of eddy generation is the outflow from Barguzin Bay which interacts with the coastline. Subsequent eddy generation is driven by density gradients and geostrophic adjustment. In summer, this outflow is dominated by river inflow and lead to the formation of warm anticyclonic eddies. After autumnal vertical overturn, the outflow is forced by the wind bringing cold water from the bay to Middle Baikal and creating cold anticyclonic eddies. We suggest that in the autumn, when the surrounding water cools to a temperature below about 4 degrees C, these cold eddies sink and transform into intrathermocline lens-like eddies that persist under ice and can later create giant ice rings on the Baikal ice cover.

The Potential of Organic Sediments in Florida Spring Runs as Records of Environmental Change	SOUTHEASTERN GEOGRAPHER												The origin of modern spring flow in Florida is generally presumed to correspond with sea-level stabilization at or near present levels during the Middle Holocene. Low sea level and associated karstic aquifer drawdown have been assumed to have prevented artesian flow in current Florida spring systems throughout the Terminal Pleistocene. However, little paleoenvironmental work has been undertaken to test these assumptions. Substantial ecological changes within many of Florida's spring runs over the past two decades have raised interest in the use of sediment core analyses to characterize the nature, extent, timing, and potential triggers of these changes. We evaluated the extent and age of organic material accumulation in a broad sample of fifteen spring runs in central Florida. Radiocarbon dating of sediment cores indicated that many of these runs have accumulated organic material for thousands of years; five of the fifteen spring runs contain organic material that pre-dates Holocene sea-level stabilization. Therefore, either saturation or inundation of Florida's artesian spring runs was much more geographically and temporally variable than has been previously assumed. It is likely that paleoenvironmental reconstructions of those runs with lengthy sediment records will produce new knowledge about paleoclimate, paleobiology, and more recent ecological change.

Influence of habitat condition on shallow rocky reef fish community structure around islands and headlands of a temperate marine protected area	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Rocky reef fish assemblages in coastal areas are under increasing pressure from a range of human activities, including extraction via recreational and commercial fishing. Within Australia, spatial management of fish assemblages aims to protect habitats and regulate harvest pressure via the use of no-take areas (NTAs), where no extraction is permitted, and partially protected areas (PPAs), where limited fishing is allowed but higher impact activities (e.g. trawling) are prohibited. We used a novel combination of mini-baited remote underwater video (mini-BRUV) systems and in situ microhabitat assessments to assess whether reef fish community structure on shallow (6-9 m) rocky reefs varied with spatial management zone (NTAs versus PPAs), sampling season (autumn, spring) and benthic habitat condition around coastal islands and headlands within the Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park (established in 2007). While fish community composition and the relative abundance of fish species did not differ significantly across spatial management zones, there were significant differences among sampling season, and spatial variation at the site level that was partly explained by geomorphology (island/headland). Notably, there was a strong association between variation in fish community structure and site-level cover of canopy forming macroalgae among islands and headlands, which transcended management zones. Our study suggests that balancing habitat condition and geomorphological setting (islands, headlands) among management zones is key to the conservation and management of shallow-water reef fish assemblages. In particular, the percent cover of canopy-forming macroalgae may be a key habitat indicator for designing, monitoring and rebalancing spatial management zones.

Assessing the horizontal gradients in dissolved gas concentrations from large river reaches to connecting canals and wetland lakes remains a challenge in many deltaic systems. To elucidate the processes affecting local CO2 and CH4 concentrations in the Romanian part of the Danube Delta, we mapped dissolved O-2, N-2, He and Ar using a portable gas-equilibration membrane-inlet mass spectrometer (GE-MIMS), along with CO2, CH4, water temperature and conductivity. We measured the concentrations along the aquatic continuum from a small houseboat during two campaigns, in spring and autumn, to capture different hydrological and plant growth conditions. Delta-scale concentration patterns were comparably stable across seasons. Small connecting channels were highly influenced by the riparian wetland, which was strongest in the eastern part of the biosphere reserve. These sites represented the delta's CO2 and CH4 hotspots and showed clear signs of excess air, i.e., supersaturation of dissolved noble gases with respect to air-saturated water. As the adjacent wetland was permanently inundated, this signal was likely caused by root aeration of Phragmites australis, as opposed to traditional excess air formation via water table fluctuations in the unsaturated zone. The special vegetation setting with reed growing on floating peat coincided with the highest CO2 and CH4 concentrations (>700 mu mol/L CO2 and 13 mu mol/L CH4, respectively) observed in an adjacent channel. Shallow lakes, on the other hand, were major sites of photosynthetic production with O-2 oversaturation reaching up to 150% in spring. The observed deficit in non-reactive gases (He, Ar and N-2) indicated that the lakes were affected by O-2 ebullition from macrophytes. According to our estimations, this ebullitive flux decreased O-2 concentrations by up to 2 mg/L. This study highlights the effect of plant-mediated gas transfer on dissolved gas concentrations and supports recent studies stressing the need to account for ebullitive gas exchange when assessing metabolism parameters from O-2 in shallow, productive settings.
