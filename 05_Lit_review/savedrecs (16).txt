J	JOHNSON, JH; DROPKIN, DS				JOHNSON, JH; DROPKIN, DS			SUMMER FOOD-HABITS OF SPOTFIN SHINER, MIMIC SHINER, AND SUBYEARLING FALLFISH IN THE SUSQUEHANNA RIVER BASIN	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Summer diet composition and overlap in diet among spotfin shiners (Notropis spilopterus), mimic shiners (N. volucellus), and subyearling fallfish (Semotilus corporalis) from three sites in the Susquehanna River basin were examined. All three species fed heavily on aerial aquatic and terrestrial insects. Hymenopterans, adult chironomids, and emerging hydropsychids were the major prey. Subyearling spotfin shiners (10-17 mm, TL) fed almost exclusively on adult chironomids. Subyearling fallfish had the most diverse diets and utilized benthic prey more extensively than the other species. Summer diet overlap was high between spotfin shiners and mimic shiners (C-lambda = 0.718) and between spotfin shiner and fallfish (0.684). Diet overlap was moderate between mimic shiners and fallfish (0.495). Dietary analysis indicated that the three species fed variously on drifting prey and had similar diets.																			0270-5060					MAR	1991	6	1					35	42		10.1080/02705060.1991.9665273	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1991.9665273													WOS:A1991FJ43400004

However, the fate of RDOM derived from the primary production in inland lake is unclear. In this study of Erhai lake in China, used the combination of delta C-13, carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio, and optical spectroscopy analyses to constrain the variation of organic matter in the vertical direction (i.e., lake water -> trap sediments -> surface sediments -> core sediments), to trace the burial process of RDOM. Two autochthonous components (C1, C2) and two allochthonous components (C3, C4) were identified in the water. High concentrations of C2 in winter and spring indicate that these two seasons provide favourable burial conditions for autochthonous dissolved organic matter. Three autochthonous components (C1, C2, C5) and three allochthonous components (C3, C4, C6) were identified in the sediments. The contributions of autochthonous organic matter were similar to 49.9 +/- 5.84 % (based on PARAFAC analysis) and similar to 56.7 +/- 5.62 % (based on the C/N ratio) in the sediment trap samples; 43.4 +/- 8.84 % (based on PARAFAC analysis) and 40.8 +/- 14.26 % (based on the C/N ratio) in the surface sediments; and 44.5 +/- 14.4 % (based on PARAFAC analysis) and 48.4 +/- 6.04 % (based on the C/N ratio) in the core sediments. Additionally, C2, which is the autochthonous component after microbial mineralisation, was preserved as a significant part of the RDOM in the water. Our results suggest that the mineralisation of autochthonous organic matter (OM) in the core sediments did not promote bacterial mineralization, and that the burial of OM on long timescales dependents primarily on its concentration rather than on its origin. Our results provide a new perspective for studying the stability of autochthonous OM and highlight a new direction for the study of the carbon sink of inland lakes.

The total number of bacteria in samples was determined by a direct method, counting with an epifluorescence microscope after staining by acridine orange. The total number of bacteria ranged from 2.0x10(5) cells.ml(-1) in the purest basin (Vodozahvat), to 7.7x10(7) cells.ml(-1) in the most polluted one (Zlatari). The number of bacteria was highest in spring (March). and the lowest in winter (December). The bottom layer of water in the reservoir contained the highest number of bacteria, while the middle layer contained the lowest bacterial count. The difference between these two layers in the number of bacteria was statistically significant (p<0.05). The dominant morphotype were rods (52.5 to 68.0%), followed by cocci (28.0 to 40.0%) and curved forms (1.7 to 16.0%). Percentage of rods was the lowest, while that of cocci was the highest, in Vodozahvat. The number of rods was significantly higher at the bottom compared to surface and middle layers of the water column, p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively. Significant difference in the number of cocci occurred only between the middle and bottom layers (p<0.05), while the number of curved bacteria did not differ significantly between the layers.

Lake Trout population dynamics in the Northern Refuge of Lake Michigan: Importance of stocking rate	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												ObjectiveThe Northern Refuge of Lake Michigan was established under the auspices of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission in 1985 as an additional step toward restoring a self-sustaining Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush population to the lake. The overall goal of our study was to assess progress toward Lake Trout rehabilitation in the Northern Refuge through 2021.MethodsWe conducted annual (1992-2021) gill-net surveys in the fall to assess the adult population and beam trawl surveys in the spring to assess naturally reproduced age-0 Lake Trout.ResultSpawner abundance averaged 45 fish center dot 305 m of gill net-1 center dot day-1 during 1992-1999, just 4 fish center dot 305 m of gill net-1 center dot day-1 during 2000-2014, and then 67 fish center dot 305 m of gill net-1 center dot day-1 during 2018-2021. Sea Lamprey Petromyzon marinus wounding rate decreased by nearly 90% between the 2000-2014 and 2015-2021 periods. The average annual mortality rate of adult Lake Trout decreased from 43% during the 1990s and 2000s to 22% during 2015-2021. All of these population dynamics were partly driven by changes in Lake Trout stocking rates, which declined by roughly 50% during 1994-1996 but then increased roughly twofold during 2006-2010 and remained at this higher level during 2010-2018. In 2021, early signs of natural recruitment of Lake Trout became evident. Beam trawling during June 2021 yielded a wild age-0 Lake Trout, the first ever caught since the surveys began in 1992. In addition, 15 (4% of total catch) of the Lake Trout caught in the fall 2021 gill-net survey were unclipped (wild) fish. Estimated ages of these wild fish indicated that natural recruitment had begun sometime around 2015.ConclusionWith Alewife Alosa pseudoharengus abundance in Lake Michigan at record low levels, Sea Lamprey wounding rate greatly reduced, and Lake Trout spawner abundance at relatively high levels, the outlook for Lake Trout rehabilitation in the Northern Refuge holds promise. We documented significant progress toward the goal of establishing a self-sustaining Lake Trout population in the Northern Refuge of Lake Michigan during 2009-2021. Accomplishing this goal is a key step in stabilizing the ecosystem, but additional effort is still needed to reach the goal.Impact statement						Leonhardt, Benjamin/0000-0002-7140-4227; Dieter, Patricia M./0000-0003-1686-2679; O'Brien, Timothy/0000-0003-4502-5204													0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG	2023	43	4					1017	1034		10.1002/nafm.10915	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10915													WOS:001152312500009

Lithostratigraphic subdivisions of the Mesoproterozoic Copper Harbor Formation (Oronto Group) in Michigan and Wisconsin, USA	STRATIGRAPHY												The Copper Harbor Formation (CHF) of Michigan and Wisconsin, USA is subdivided into distinct lithostratigraphic units. We divide the CHF into four formal members. From oldest to youngest are the Great Conglomerate Falls Member (pebble to cobble clast supported conglomerate), the Gorge Falls Member (pebble to boulder clast supported conglomerate with sandstone lenses, containing two tongues), the Sandstone Falls Member (pebble conglomerate and sandstone, containing two named lenses and one named tongue), and the Union Bay Member (sandstone, containing one named lens). The designation of members will aid in mapping and structural interpretations, as well as future chronostratigraphic work. The largest flows of the Lake Shore Traps (LSTs) are also defined herein and are kept as units within the CHF. They are from oldest to youngest the Potawatomi Flows, Cloud Peak Flows, Brockway Flow, Hunters Point Flows, and Seven Mile Point Flow. The flows are included within the four sedimentary members and the term LSTs remains informal.																			1547-139X	2331-656X					2018	15	2					135	152		10.29041/strat.15.2.135-152	http://dx.doi.org/10.29041/strat.15.2.135-152													WOS:000445421100005
J	Weisse, T				Weisse, T			Growth and production of heterotrophic nanoflagellates in a meso-eutrophic lake	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The growth of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) in mesotrophic Lake Constance was measured in situ during a 13 month period. Experiments were conducted with 10 mu m pre-filtered lake water incubated in diffusion chambers at 3 m water depth at the sampling location for 24 h. Growth rates were calculated from changes in cell numbers occurring during the period of incubation. Growth rates of all dominant taxa showed pronounced seasonal variation (-0.13 to 1.76 day(-1)) and were generally highest in summer at high water temperatures. In situ growth rates were well below maximum growth rates known for the respective and similar species from laboratory experiments. While water temperature was a key parameter positively related to the growth of all HNF species, the effect of various potential food items was taxon specific and less clear. Bacterial abundance was equally important as temperature for growth in the small bacterivorous Spumella sp., but was insignificant for growth rates of the larger omnivorous Kathablepharis sp. In Spumella sp., 84% of the observed seasonal variation of its growth rate could be explained by temperature and bacterial food supply. Based on these results, a multiple linear regression equation with temperature and bacterial concentration as dependent variables was calculated for the growth rate of Spumella. Taxon-specific production rates were derived from growth rates and average biomass of these two species, and compared to total HNF production estimated from previously measured community growth rates and biomass in Lake Constance. Production peaks of Spumella sp. and Kathablepharis sp. alternated seasonally. Total HNF production ranged from -0.01 to 10 mg C m(-3) day(-1). The average seasonal production varied between 1.4 and 3.5 mg C m(-3) day(-1) over 6 consecutive years. These small protozoa thus contribute a substantial amount to total zooplankton production in Lake Constance.					; Weisse, Thomas/HTQ-1404-2023	Weisse, Thomas/0000-0001-6103-6558; 													0142-7873	1464-3774				JUN	1997	19	6					703	722		10.1093/plankt/19.6.703	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/19.6.703													WOS:A1997XE19900004

In this study, an increase of the Neotropic Cormorant (Phalacrocorax brasilianus) population in the Ecuadorian Andes was documented using census data from three high Andean lakes (Yahuarcocha, San Pablo and Yambo) for 2004-2010. In the 20th Century, only one record of the species existed for the study area. From 2005 onward, the species occurred regularly at all three lakes. At Yahuarcocha, the wintering population (October-February) grew at an annual rate of 0.382 +/- 0.05, reaching 307 in 2010. The population consists mainly of non-breeding migrants, and at the present time, the wintering distribution range of cormorant populations in Ecuador includes the high Andes. Given reports of cormorant predation at fish farms, potential conflicts on account of cormorant expansion are discussed. Received 21 December 2010, accepted 18 July 2011.

J	Morris, DP; Hargreaves, BR				Morris, DP; Hargreaves, BR			The role of photochemical degradation of dissolved organic carbon in regulating the UV transparency of three lakes on the Pocono Plateau	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The role of photochemical degradation of dissolved organic carbon (DOG) on UV transparency (280-300 nm) was investigated in three Pocono Plateau lakes. Diffuse attenuation coefficients (K-dUV) in the epilimnia of these lakes varied seasonally (39-81% decline from maximum Kd(320nm)), with minimum K-dUV values occurring near summer solstice. Declines in K-dUV corresponded to reductions in UV absorbance by dissolved material (a(dUV)), caused by declines in both DOC concentration and UV absorptivity (a(d):[DOC]). The seasonal decline in K-dUV was also accompanied by substantial increases in an absorption coefficient ratio (a(d250nm): a(d365nm)) and decreases in spectral slopes (S). Experimental studies of photochemical degradation were also performed using filtered lake water and natural sunlight. Exposure to solar radiation produced a number of changes in optical parameters and DOC that resembled those observed in the water column: a(dUV) (-35 to -52%), UV absorptivity (-31 to -48%), a(d250nm):a(d365nm) (0 to + 39%), spectral slope, S (0 to 27%), and DOC concentration 0 to 20%). Changes in a(dUV) were correlated with absorbed UV dose. The derived rate constants were used in a model to estimate the contribution of photochemical degradation of DOC to water column declines in K-dUV. Results suggest that rates of photochemical degradation were sufficient to account for the summer reductions in K-dUV. Results suggest that rates of photochemical degradation were sufficient to account for the summer reductions in K-dUV observed in the three lakes.																			0024-3590					MAR	1997	42	2					239	249		10.4319/lo.1997.42.2.0239	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1997.42.2.0239													WOS:A1997XK56100004

The Oka hydrothermal system, East Sayan mountains	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND SEISMOLOGY												The western flank of the Baikal Rift Zone contains the Oka hydrothermal system of the "volcanogenic type," which is related to the occurrence of basaltic volcanism. It consists of springs for the discharge of thermal and subthermal waters confined to the intersections of faults of various settings at the boundary of two major lithospheric blocks. Helium isotope data were used to find heat flow for all springs of the hydrothermal system; this heat flow is comparable with that across the bottom of the Baikal southern basin. Predicted hydrotherm temperatures were calculated at the depths of their generation using silica and cation thermometers. The average depth of generation of the springs that form the Oka hydrothermal system is 2.8 km, which is 1.1 km nearer to the ground surface than the h of the hydrothermal occurrences around Lake Baikal. The spatial coincidence between the location of the hydrothermal system and the area of young volcanism provides evidence of a common source of heat, while the thermal parameters of the system, its gas and chemical compositions, correlate with the age of the volcanism.

The Episodic Event Model (EEM) was used to simulate spring snowmelt events. Snow course data, precipitation data and lake acidification surveys were used to derive values for the EEM parameters. Spring snowmelt events were shown to have great impacts on the water quality of Sierran lakes. Lakes are likely to be most affected by the early-spring snowmelt event because the epilimnion depth is at a minimum, which indicates minimum dilution. Under annual average loading conditions, no Sierran lake has been reported as acidic although 29% of the lakes have alkalinities less than 40-mu-eq/L indicating a sensitivity to acidification. In simulations of early-spring snowmelt events, using present-day acidic loading conditions, it was estimated 79% +/- 9% of the lakes would experience shortterm lake alkalinity depressions to levels less than 40-mu-eq/L. The results provided by the model simulations are valuable in establishing upper and lower limits on the extent of possible episodic acidification to lake-resources-at-risk. The most critical parameters controlling the magnitude of lake alkalinity depressions during snowmelt episodic events are a) the lake area to watershed area ratio - a measure of input loading, and b) the epilimnion volume - a measure of dilution and mixing.

J	Masunaga, E; Komuro, S				Masunaga, Eiji; Komuro, Shunsuke			Stratification and mixing processes associated with hypoxia in a shallow lake (Lake Kasumigaura, Japan)	LIMNOLOGY												Physical processes associated with hypoxia events in a shallow lake, Lake Kasumigaura, Japan, are investigated with long-term mooring observations at the middle of the lake basin. Results show that strong stratification during the summer suppresses vertical mixing resulting in hypoxia in the bottom boundary layer. The dissolved oxygen decreases due to the limited oxygen supply under strongly stratified conditions. The intensity of the stratification is controlled by the ratio between surface wind stress and the surface incoming buoyancy flux. The Monin-Obukhov length scale explains the stratification and shows good agreement with the Froude number and Wedderburn number. The stratification is also enhanced by the heat flux towards the sediments, reaching O (100) W m(-2), during the summer season. In addition to field observations, this study conducted numerical simulations to further investigate mixing structure. Results from numerical simulations indicate that the bottom sediment heat flux significantly contributes to mixing and stratification in the lake. This study suggests that mixing processes associated with winds and heat flux at surface and bottom sediments are the key to understanding hypoxia events in Lake Kasumigaura.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				APR	2020	21	2					173	186		10.1007/s10201-019-00600-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-019-00600-3		NOV 2019											WOS:000498100600001

The excursion was part of a bilateral exchange of American scientists to the Institute for Extreme North Agricultural Research at Norilsk. Two field sites were visited: Lake Ayan (ca. 69.degree.N94.degree.30''E) in the mountainous Putorana Plateau 200 km east of Norilsk; and Pura River (approximately 72.degree.30N86.degree.E) in the rolling, moderately drained tundra of the western part of the Taimyr Peninsula. The ecosystems at each site are described, emphasizing associations between landforms, plant communities and fauna. Generalized profiles illustrate the landform/plant community relations. The main [58] plant species of each community are tabulated. Both study sites are important wildlife habitats. Lake Ayan is surrounded by Larix dahurica forest and snow-sheep (Ovis nivicola) live above the forest on the higher slopes and on the plateau surface. Of special interest is a bench landform on the valley sides which supports extensive lichen carpets used in winter by wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). The Pura River site is situated in Low Arctic tundra with a rich vascular but poor lichen flora. The site is similar to that at Meade River, Alaska, where there is a current extensive program of ecological research. Large numbers of wild reindeer and waterfowl are regular summer residents in the Pura River region.																			0004-0851						1977	9	3					305	315		10.2307/1550546	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1550546													WOS:A1977DW04800008
J	Smith, LK; Lewis, WM				Smith, Lesley; Lewis, William, Jr.			SEASONALITY OF METHANE EMISSIONS FROM FIVE LAKES AND ASSOCIATED WETLANDS OF THE COLORADO ROCKIES	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Methane emissions were measured over a 15-month interval for five lakes and five associated wetland sites in the Rockies of Colorado at elevations between 2800 and 3600 m. Three of the five lakes accumulated dissolved methane under ice; accumulation was as high as 53-fold above ice-free water column concentrations in the shallowest lake. The combination of high dissolved oxygen and low dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations within the water column during ice breakup suggests that methane emissions rather than methane oxidation led to the substantial loss of dissolved methane from the shallowest lake at the time of spring thaw. A pulsed release of methane to the atmosphere at the time of ice breakup within lakes may be widespread at high latitudes and may play a role in the observed increase in tropospheric methane concentrations in the northern hemisphere. During the ice-free season, the mean emission rate was 1.6 mmol m(-2) d(-1) over open water for the five lakes, but the mean was much higher (13 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) over the Nuphar lutea beds located in one of the lakes. Open water emissions occurred primarily through diffusion rather than bubbling. For wetlands near the lakes, average lake emissions ranged from negligible to almost 6 mmol m(-2) d(-1); the average across all sites was 2.1 mmol m(-2) d(-1) during the warm season. There was no measurable emission during the winter months. Surface dissolved methane explains 40% of the variation in emissions from the open water sites; the combination of soil organic C content and soil temperature explains 40% of variation in emissions from the wetland sites. The data from the Southern Rockies and information that has accumulated on other lake types over the last 15 years indicate that lakes may be a larger source strength of methane than reported estimates.																			0886-6236	1944-9224				DEC	1992	6	4					323	338		10.1029/92GB02016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/92GB02016													WOS:000211488800001

Seasonal effects and influence of water velocity in an open once-through seawater cooling system	APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING												The fouling is one of the main problems affecting industrial heat exchangers using water from natural sources (lakes, rivers and sea) as the cooling agent. Negative consequences of the fouling formation are the reduction in heat transfer, loss of cooling efficiency, premature deterioration of facilities and increased operation and maintenance costs. In order to minimize this undesirable phenomenon and its effects, antifouling treatments are applied to reduce the accumulation of deposits. A major concern among industrial facilities is the correct choice of a suitable antifouling treatment and its optimization in order to keep the cooling system in optimal conditions and, at the same time, minimize harmful discharges to the environment. This study evaluates the development of fouling in a condenser of a combined cycle power plant, cooled by seawater under actual operating conditions, which means: irregular chlorine treatment, seasonal influence and fluctuation of flow rate according to the number of circulating pumps in operation. The aim of the study was to determine the best operating conditions for improving antifouling treatment. The experiments were carried out in a pilot plant simulating the industrial condenser and operating as side-stream monitoring device on the cooling system while drawing water from the same point than the power plant. Fouling progression throughout an annual cycle and under actual operating conditions was monitored and evaluated. In all the seasons, the chlorine-based antifouling treatment reduced the amount of total solids by approximately 80-85% compared to the control. Control tubes as well as the rest of the test tubes, presented the maximum accumulated fouling in spring, while the lowest quantity of fouling was obtained in winter. The results under the different operating conditions showed that both, the solids accumulation as well as the heat transfer resistance were higher than the rest, when low water velocities were used.

To determine if purple loosestrife infestation alters aquatic invertebrate communities, the abundance and size distribution of aquatic invertebrates associated with purple loosestrife were quantified during the spring and summer and compared to those within stands of two other commonly occurring emergents, cattail (Typha latifolia) and bulrush (Scirpus acutus). Aquatic invertebrates representing 10 taxa (classes or orders) were collected using four different sampling techniques. Individuals from each taxa were collected in all three vegetation types, although the size of the individuals of some orders was smaller in Lythrum. Measurements of water quality indicated no significant (p less than or equal to 0.05) differences among the three vegetation types, despite the fact that Scirpus tended to be established in deeper water than Lythrum. Results indicate that monotypic stands of purple loosestrife are not lacking in aquatic invertebrates however, because our study was conducted in a mixed vegetation wetland at an intermediate stage of purple loosestrife infestation, our findings may not be representative of more extreme purple loosestrife invasions.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				DEC	2001	21	4					593	601		10.1672/0277-5212(2001)021[0593:AICAWP]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/0277-5212(2001)021[0593:AICAWP]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000172918700013

Freeze-Up Ice Jams and Channel Hydraulics Cause Hazardous Open Water Zones Within Winter Ice Cover on the Kuskokwim and Yukon Rivers and Their Tributaries	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Timing and completeness of freeze-up on northern rivers impact winter travel and indicate responses to climate change. Open-water zones (OWZs) within ice-covered rivers are hazardous and may be increasing in extent and persistence. To better understand the distribution, variability, and mechanisms of OWZs, we selected nine reaches totaling 380 river-km for remote sensing analysis and field studies in western Alaska. We initially identified 48 OWZs from November 2022 optical imagery, inventoried their persistence into late winter and interannual consistency over previous years, and at a subset measured ice thickness, water depth and velocity, and physicochemistry. The most consistent locations of OWZ formation occurred below sharp bends and channel constrictions, whereas locations associated with river bars and eroding banks were more transient. Of 359 OWZs identified in early winter over 6 years, 8% persisted into late winter & horbar;all on the Yukon River mainstem. Although several OWZs were in locations where we anticipated groundwater influence, we found no field data indication of groundwater upwelling. Observations of jumble ice upstream of many OWZs led us to examine freeze-up ice jam locations in optical imagery, which showed strong correspondence to downstream OWZs. We hypothesize that reaches downstream of ice jams are much slower to freeze-over due to restricted ice transport and high turbulence caused by channel form and ice-affected hydraulics. Future work should focus on evaluation of this and other competing hypothesis at both reach and river network scales to predict OWZ locations and occurrence relative to other processes affecting river freeze-up in northern climates.

Continuous earlywood vessels chronologies in floodplain ring-porous species can improve dendrohydrological reconstructions of spring high flows and flood levels	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Plants respond to environmental stimuli through changes in growth and development. Characteristics of wood cells such as the cross-sectional area of vessel elements (hereafter referred to as vessels) may store information about environmental factors present at the time of vessel differentiation. The analysis of vessel characteristics therefore offers a different time resolution than annual ring width because vessels in tree rings differentiate within days to a few weeks. Little research has been conducted on the sensitivity of earlywood vessels in ring-porous species in response to flooding. The general objectives of this study were to determine the plasticity of earlywood vessel to high flows and spring flooding in floodplain black ash (Fraxinus nigra Marsh.) trees and to assess the utility of developing continuous earlywood vessel chronologies in dendrohydrological reconstruction. In contrast, most dendrohydrological studies until now have mainly used vessel anomalies (flood rings) as discrete variables to identify exceptional flood events. The study area is located in the boreal region of northwestern Quebec. Vessel and ring-width chronologies were generated from F. nigra trees growing on the floodplain of Lake Duparquet. Spring discharge had among all hydro-climatic variables the strongest impact on vessel formation and this signal was coherent spatially and in the frequency domain. The mean vessel area chronology was significantly and negatively correlated to discharge and both the linearity and the strength of this association were unique. In floodplain F. nigra trees, spring flooding promoted the formation of more abundant but smaller earlywood vessels. Earlywood vessels chronologies were also significantly associated with other hydrological indicators like Lake Duparquet's ice break-up date and both ice-scar frequency and height chronologies. These significant relationships stress the utility of developing continuous vessels chronologies for hydrological reconstructions prior to instrumental data. Continuous earlywood vessel chronologies may also be useful in determining the impact of altered hydrological regime in floodplain habitat regulated by spring floods. Future research should involve quantifying the impact of high flows and flooding on other cell constituents and also determining the plasticity and utility of continuous anatomical series in floodplain diffuse-porous species.

Landslides triggered by the 8 October 2005 Kashmir earthquake	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The 8 October 2005 Kashmir earthquake triggered several thousand landslides. These were mainly rock falls and debris falls, although translational rock and debris slides also occurred. In addition, a sturzstrom (debris avalanche) comprising similar to 80 million m(3) buried four villages and blocked streams to create two lakes. Although landsliding occurred throughout the region, covering an area of > 7500 km(2), the failures were highly concentrated, associated with six geomorphic-geologic-anthropogenic settings, including natural failures in (1) highly fractured carbonate rocks comprising the lowest beds in the hanging wall of the likely earthquake fault; (2) Tertiary siliciclastic rocks along antecedent drainages that traverse the Hazara-Kashmir Syntaxis; (3) steep (> 50 degrees) slopes comprising Precambrian and Lower Paleozoic rocks; (4) very steep (>> 50 degrees) lower slopes of fluvially undercut Quaternary valley fills; and (5) ridges and spur crests. The sixth setting was associated with road construction. Extensive fissuring in many of the valley slopes together with the freshly mobilized landslide debris constitutes a potential hazard in the coming snowmelt and monsoon seasons. This study supports the view that earthquake-triggered landslides are highly concentrated in specific zones associated with the lithology, structure, geomorphology, topography, and human presence.

Multiple tracers demonstrate distinct sources of dissolved organic matter to lakes of the Mackenzie Delta, western Canadian Arctic	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Lakes of the Mackenzie Delta occur across a gradient that contains three clear end members: those that remain connected to river-water channels throughout the summer; those that receive only brief inputs of river water during an annual spring flood but contain dense macrophyte stands; and those that experience significant permafrost thaw along their margins. We measured dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, dissolved organic matter (DOM) absorption and fluorescence, and stable isotopes of DOM, DOM precursor materials, and bacteria to elucidate the importance of river water, macrophytes, and thermokarst as DOM sources to Mackenzie Delta lakes. Despite standing stocks of macrophyte C that are sevenfold to 12-fold greater than those of total DOC, stable isotopes indicated that autochthonous sources contributed less than 15% to overall DOM in macrophyte-rich lakes. Instead, fluorescence and absorption indicated that the moderate summertime increase in DOC concentration in macrophyte-rich lakes was the result of infrequent flushing, while bacterial delta(13)C indicated rapid bacterial removal of autochthonous DOC from the water column. In thermokarst lakes, summertime increases in DOC concentration were substantial, and stable isotopes indicated that much of this increase came from C released as a result of thermokarst-related processes. Our results indicate that these distinct sources of DOM to neighboring arctic Delta lakes may drive between-lake differences in C cycling and energy flow. Rapidly assimilated macrophyte DOM should be an important contributor to microbial food webs in our study lakes. In contrast, the accumulation of thermokarst-origin DOM allows for a significant role in physico-chemistry but indicates a lesser contribution of this DOM to higher trophic levels.					; Osburn, Chris/A-9339-2010; Tank, Suzanne/I-4816-2012	Osburn, Christopher/0000-0002-9334-4202; Gareis, Jolie/0000-0001-6199-6823; Tank, Suzanne/0000-0002-5371-6577													0024-3590					JUL	2011	56	4					1297	1309		10.4319/lo.2011.56.4.1297	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2011.56.4.1297													WOS:000294603400010

Dietary responses of Sahul (Pleistocene Australia-New Guinea) megafauna to climate and environmental change	PALEOBIOLOGY												Throughout the late Quaternary, the Sahul (Pleistocene Australia-New Guinea) vertebrate fauna was dominated by a diversity of large mammals, birds, and reptiles, commonly referred to as megafauna. Since ca. 450-400Ka, approximately 88 species disappeared in Sahul, including kangaroos exceeding 200kg in size, wombat-like animals the size of hippopotamuses, flightless birds, and giant monitor lizards that were likely venomous. Ongoing debates over the primary cause of these extinctions have typically favored climate change or human activities. Improving our understanding of the population biology of extinct megafauna as more refined paleoenvironmental data sets become available will assist in identifying their potential vulnerabilities. Here, we apply a multiproxy approach to analyze fossil teeth from deposits dated to the middle and late Pleistocene at Cuddie Springs in southeastern Australia, assessing relative aridity via oxygen isotopes as well as vegetation and megafaunal diets using both carbon isotopes and dental microwear texture analyses. We report that the Cuddie Springs middle Pleistocene fauna was largely dominated by browsers, including consumers of C-4 shrubs, but that by late Pleistocene times the C-4 dietary component was markedly reduced. Our results suggest dietary restriction in more arid conditions. These dietary shifts are consistent with other independently derived isotopic data from eggshells and wombat teeth that also suggest a reduction in C-4 vegetation after similar to 45 Ka in southeastern Australia, coincident with increasing aridification through the middle to late Pleistocene. Understanding the ecology of extinct species is important in clarifying the primary drivers of faunal extinction in Sahul. The results presented here highlight the potential impacts of aridification on marsupial megafauna. The trend to increasingly arid conditions through the middle to late Pleistocene (as identified in other paleoenvironmental records and now also observed, in part, in the Cuddie Springs sequence) may have stressed the most vulnerable animals, perhaps accelerating the decline of late Pleistocene megafauna in Australia.					; Wroe, Stephen/A-4462-2010; Field, Judith/C-7677-2011	DeSantis, Larisa/0000-0003-1159-9154; Wroe, Stephen/0000-0002-6365-5915; Field, Judith/0000-0001-6807-1858; 													0094-8373	1938-5331				MAY	2017	43	2					181	195		10.1017/pab.2016.50	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/pab.2016.50													WOS:000399414600002

Either (NH4+)-N-15 or a mixture of N-15-labelled amino acids (both at 4 muM N final concentration) was added to Lake Michigan water. Net fluxes were measured over 24 h under natural light and dark conditions using deck-top incubators and compared to microbial food web characteristics. Isotope dilution experiments showed similar light and dark NH4+ regeneration rates at lake ( 6 versus 5 nM N h(-1)) and river-influenced ( 20 versus 24 nM N h(-1)) sites. Ammonium uptake rates were similar to regeneration rates in dark bottles. Dark uptake ( attributed mainly to bacteria) accounted for -70% of total uptake ( bacteria plus phytoplankton) in the light at most lake sites but only -30% of total uptake at river-influenced sites in or near the St. Joseph River mouth (SJRM). Cluster analysis grouped stations having zero, average, or higher than average N-cycling rates. Discriminant analysis indicated that chlorophyll concentration, oligotrich ciliate biomass, and total P concentration could explain 66% of N-cycling rate variation on average. Heterotrophic bacterial N demand was about one third of the NH4+ regeneration rate. Results suggest that, with the exception of SJRM stations, bacterial uptake and protist grazing mediated much of the N dynamics during spring transition. Since NH4+ is more available to bacteria than NO3-, regenerated NH4+ may have a strong influence on spring, lake biochemical energetics by enhancing N-poor organic matter degradation in this NO3--replete ecosystem.

The analytical parameters included pH, conductivity, and cation (Na+, NH4+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+) and anion (Cl-, NO3-, SO42-) concentrations. The monthly volume-weighted mean pH of the rainwater ranged from 3.9 to 5.1, with a mean of 4.5, thus showing moderate to strong acidification. Factor analysis indicated that the possible sources for the major ions in the precipitation were anthropogenic/crustal, marine and biomass burning products. Wet deposition varied with season; the highest flux of inorganic nitrogen (NO3--N + NH4+-N) occurred in the summer and averaged 160 mg/m(2)/month. Less nitrogen was delivered by dry deposition which was highest in spring 2004 (March-May, 23 and 50 mg/m(2)/month for NO3--N and NH4+-N, respectively). The total annual atmospheric deposition of NH4+-N (1100 mg/m(2)/yr) was about twice that of NO3--N (560 mg/m(2)/yr). The combined direct deposition to the lake proper was 7.1 x 10(7) g-N/yr while the estimated annual flux to the entire Lake Sihwa basin was 7.9 x 10(8) g-N/yr. Of the total atmospheric inorganic N entering Lake Sihwa (2.7 x 10(8) g-N/yr), 26% was from direct deposition and 74% from indirect deposition. To estimate the potential impact of atmospheric nitrogen oil primary production in the lake, chlorophyll-a equivalents were calculated assuming Redfield stoichiometry; this was estimated to be about 8% of the total chlorophyll-a produced in 2004.																			0016-7002	1880-5973					2009	43	5					305	314		10.2343/geochemj.1.0027	http://dx.doi.org/10.2343/geochemj.1.0027													WOS:000271141900002

Furnas lake is located in Furnas Volcano, the easternmost of the three active central volcanoes of the Sao Miguel island. The lake has an area of 1.87 km(2) and a maximum length and width equal to 2025 and 1600 m, respectively. The maximum depth of the water column is 15 m and the estimated water storage is 14 x 10(6) m(3). Lake water temperature is cold, with temperature values between 13 degrees C and 15 degrees C in the winter period and 18.9 degrees C to 19.3 degrees C in early autumn, and the variation along the water column suggests a monomictic character. The major-ion relative composition is in decreasing order Na+ > K+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ for cations and HCO3- > Cl- > SO42- for anions, and conductivity and pH measurements, respectively in the range of 152 to 165 mu S cm(-1) and 53 to 8.7, suggests that Furnas has neutral-diluted waters and can be classified as a non-active lake. Diffuse CO2 flux measurements were made using the accumulation chamber method with a total of 1537 and 2577 measurements performed in two different sampling campaigns. The total amount of diffuse CO2 emitted to the atmosphere was estimated between 28 and 321 t km(-2) d(-1), respectively, in the second and first sampling campaigns, corresponding to similar to 52 and similar to 600 t d(-1). The main anomalous degassing area identified over the Furnas lake during both surveys is probably associated to a WNW-ESE trending tectonic structure. Other secondary areas are also suggested to be tectonically influenced. Identified anomalous areas showed similarities to the ones observed during previous soil CO2 degassing studies.

The long-term water temperature was related to climate variability by means of a multivariate regression model. Results revealed atmospheric connections that have been elusive so far, and showed that over the period from 1959 to 2000, summer thermal conditions in Lake Geneva appear tightly linked to the long-term variability of the subtropical Atlantic climate. The multivariate model revealed high skills and tight correlations, which suggest the possibility of assessing future thermal changes in Lake Geneva from the Atlantic climate variability. The implications of such climatic forcing on the functioning of the pelagic ecosystem in Lake Geneva were illustrated by analysing the long-term changes in abundance of the summer-dominant carnivorous cladocerans Bythotrephes longimanus and Leptodora kindtii during the period 1974 to 2000. Again, the multivariate model revealed high skills and excellent correlations between the interannual changes in abundance of these species and the variability of summer climate. Our approach provides a general understanding of the interrelations between large- and regional-scale climates, local environmental conditions and the ecological responses in Lake Geneva during summer, and is therefore applicable to other retrospective studies.

Following this development, reindeer densities within a 4-km radius declined gradually during winter to 8% of pre-development densities without significant changes in undeveloped control sites. During summer, reindeer gradually reduced use of areas within 4 km distance from roads and power lines to 36% of predevelopment density, with subsequent 217% increase in use of the few remaining sites located >4 km from infrastructure. Reindeer reproduction declined progressively as habitat was lost. Assessments of individual development projects seriously underestimate the long-term effects of the entire expanding infrastructure network. Piecemeal development has resulted in an estimated 70% loss of undisturbed reindeer habitat across the last century in Norway. During this time the reindeer population has become fragmented into 26 isolated sub-populations. Our results show that any further infrastructure development will put the remaining European population of wild mountain reindeer at great risk, as further habitat fragmentation will make the remaining undisturbed patches too small for holding viable populations. A general model of impacts of infrastructure on wildlife is presented. We discuss the importance of controlling piecemeal development in infrastructure for conservation of wildlife and argue that minimizing infrastructure development is likely one of the largest challenges in wildlife conservation ahead.

This upland region remained ice-free throughout the last glacial cycle and the two lake basins retain sediments deposited during the previous interglacial period as well as during the Holocene period, but they did not accumulate sediment during most of the glacial period. Midge remains are abundant and well preserved at both sites. Midge-inferred summer surface water temperatures and mean July air temperatures were estimated using an inference model built on modem samples spanning a geographic range extending from Devon Island, Canada to Maine, USA. Data from twenty-nine new surface samples from Baffin Island were added to an existing inference model. The new weighted averaging (WA) model for summer surface water temperature yields r(jack)(2)=0.88 and RMSEP=2.22 degrees C for summer water temperatures, and r(jack)(2)=0.88 and RMSEP=1.53 degrees C for mean July air temperatures. Reconstructions at both sites indicate that summer temperatures during the last interglacial were higher than at any time in the Holocene, and 5 to 10 degrees C higher than present. Peak Holocene temperatures occurred in the first half of the period, and have decreased since about the mid-Holocene. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All fights reserved.

A 900-year pollen-inferred temperature and effective moisture record from varved Lake Mina, west-central Minnesota, USA	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Drought is endemic to the North American Great Plains, causing severe economic consequences. However, instrumental climate data only exist from ca AD 1890, and limited tree-ring, paleolimnological, archeological and eolian records document the last two millennia. To address this lack of monitoring and paleoclimatic data, the pollen preserved in the varved sediments of Lake Mina, Minnesota, on the northeastern border of the Great Plains, were analyzed. May and February mean monthly temperatures and "annual precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration" were reconstructed at a 4-year resolution using a pre-settlement pollen-climate calibration set. The period of the so-called Little Ice Age (LIA) (AD 1500-1870) was colder than the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) (AD 1100-1500) in west-central Minnesota. Winter temperatures in the LIA declined more than summer ones. The pollen record suggests that the LIA occurred in three phases: an initial cold phase from AD 1505 to AD 1575, a warmer phase, and then a very cold phase from AD 1625 to AD 1775. There were severe droughts detected in the Lake Mina record from AD 1660 to AD 1710 and AD 1300 to AD 1400, suggesting that high-resolution pollen records can detect events previously defined from the tree-ring records. This latter century-scale drought is concurrent with the widely reported "AD 1250-1400 mega-drought", which exceeds the severity of 20th century droughts. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In the past, analyses of their population structure have been limited by the prevailing use of allozyme markers, which in general do not allow for the distinction of individual clones. In this study, we used 10 microsatellite markers to track changes in the taxonomic and clonal composition of Daphnia populations, and traced the abundance of the most common clones in two European reservoirs. One of the localities was inhabited by a single species of the Daphnia longispina complex (D. galeata), the other by two parental species (D. galeata and D. longispina) and their interspecific hybrids. The study took place during the transition from summer stratification to autumn mixing, representing a period of major environmental change within lake habitats. Results: In both reservoirs, we observed temporal (generation-to-generation) and spatial (along the heterogeneous reservoir environment) changes in Daphnia community structure. In the single-species reservoir, the clonal diversity of D. galeata increased with time, as a few dominant clones were replaced by a higher number of less common clones. A loss in selective advantage for the dominant clones may have been due to gradual changes in the environment, or due to selection acting in a negative frequency-dependent manner. In the multispecies reservoir, there were no apparent temporal trends in clonal diversity but we observed significantly lower clonal diversity in the interspecific hybrids than in the coexisting parental species, supporting the existence of reproductive barriers between the parental genomes. Conclusions: Our study, tracing clonal lineages of Daphnia in time and space by the fine-resolution markers, contributes to the understanding of how clonal reproduction impacts community structure in cyclically parthenogenetic organisms.					; Wolinska, Justyna/N-6455-2014; Yin, Mingbo/E-3677-2017; Seda, Jaromir/F-9072-2014; Petrusek, Adam/A-3510-2008	Wolinska, Justyna/0000-0003-2913-2923; Yin, Mingbo/0000-0002-0742-5031; Petrusek, Adam/0000-0001-5150-4370													1471-2148					JAN 27	2012	12								12	10.1186/1471-2148-12-12	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-12-12								22280487					WOS:000301890800001

Seasonality of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes within the pelagic food web of Taihu Lake	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Particulate organic matter (POM), dissolved organic matter (DOM), bacteria and cladoceran were sampled seasonally at Zhihugang Estuary and Lake Center in Taihu Lake. The delta(13)C of the four organic matter fractions showed consistent temporal variation, with heaviest values in summer and lower at other times of the year. The cladoceran delta(13)C showed a significant correlation with that of POK reflecting a heavy dietary dependence on POM during the study period. The bacteria became enriched in (13)C compared with that of DOM throughout the sampling dates, although no significant relationship was found between the two fractions. delta(13)C values of POM, cladoceran and bacteria were all negative significantly correlated with oxidation and reduction potential (ORP), and specific conductivity (SpCond). As for delta(15)N, the seasonal pattern of food web components was variable. The POM delta(15)N signature exhibited the most enriched isotope ratios during the summer months when dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) nutrients were at their lowest concentrations. The consumption of DIN in summer can explain in part the progressive accumulation of heavy nitrogen isotopes during this period. Spatially, delta(13)C and delta(15)N of the food web components were all slightly depleted at Estuary than that at Lake Center during the study period, possibly due to large allochthonous inputs at Zhihugang Estuary. Relatively wide ranges of stable isotopic values from both sites suggest that seasonality should be considered when attempting to establish food web structures in a eutrophic lake.					; Zhang, Youchi/M-6989-2016	TAN, Xiao/0000-0003-3109-9114; Zhang, Enlou/0000-0002-8057-7760; 													0003-4088						2008	44	1					1	6		10.1051/limn:2008019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn:2008019													WOS:000254637800001
J	Nishri, A; Rimmer, A; Lechinsky, Y				Nishri, Aminadav; Rimmer, Alon; Lechinsky, Yury			The mechanism of hypolimnion warming induced by internal waves	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The measured temperature of the hypolimnion of Lake Kinneret, Israel, reveals an average rise of similar to 0.6 +/- 0.3 degrees C between April and December. Three mechanisms are suggested as the cause of this rise: (i) direct radiation; (ii) an entire-lake vertical diffused heat transfer; and (iii) a mechanism of indirect warming, which is investigated here for the first time. The indirect warming mechanism prevails in the sublittoral zones, which are affected by internal seiche activity, including Poincare and Kelvin waves with cycle periods of similar to 12h and similar to 24h, respectively. During part of the seiche's time span, the warm epilimnetic water comes into contact with the underlying bottom sediments and heats them. During the rest of the seich's cycle, part of the sublittoral bed sediments become overlain by cold hypolimnetic water and cause the previously heated sediments to emit most of their heat, slightly warming the hypolimnion. The daily cycle of this indirect warming mechanism is superimposed on the seasonal cycle of the sublittoral bed sediments, which are cold in the winter and warm in the summer, in accordance with the seasonal pattern of the epilimnion's temperature. Empirical evidence that suggests that indirect warming actually takes place in response to well-documented seiche water motions is presented in this article. For example, according to the proposed analysis of sediment temperature changes, in the month of June a daily heat flux of 7.88 W m(-2) (0.68 MJ m(-2) d(-1)) was estimated. It was found that during the first 5 months of stratification this mechanism contributes similar to 41% of the thermal energy needed for the 0.6 degrees C temperature increase. This mechanism is expected to occur at any thermally stratified lake that is significantly affected by internal seiche activity.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2015	60	4					1462	1476		10.1002/lno.10109	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10109													WOS:000357894500027
J	Sheikh, Z; Yazdani, MR; Nia, AM				Sheikh, Zahra; Yazdani, Mohammad Reza; Moghaddam Nia, Alireza			Spatiotemporal changes of 7-day low flow in Iran's Namak Lake Basin: impacts of climatic and human factors	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Low flow is very sensitive to climate change and human intervention, especially in arid regions. In this study, changes of the 7-day low flow along the most important rivers of Iran's Namak Lake Basin were investigated using nonparametric (Mann-Kendall and modified-Mann-Kendall) tests. A significant diminishing trend was observed in 72.2% of stations during the period of 1970-2012. The northern part of the basin lacked a significant trend, while in other parts of the basin, the descending trend was distributed uniformly. On the other hand, the changes of the annual rainfall during this period showed no clear trend (a significant trend in 36% and non-significant trend in 64% of stations), and the identified pattern of its changes was complicated on the basin scale and during the year. On a monthly scale, a significant decreasing trend was observed in March as one of the most productive months of the year in 49% of the stations. In addition, rainfall reduction was significant (over 35%) over the past 15 years in more than 71% of the stations. Also, changes in the proportion of seasonal rainfall and rainfall regime were considerable. The share of winter and spring rainfall showed a diminishing trend in 90% and 82% of stations, respectively. Also, rainfall regime based on precipitation concentration index (PCI) revealed a tendency to disorder (in 53% of stations). The annual temperature and temperature of October and February indicated a strong ascending trend in 92%, 71%, and 64% of stations, respectively, which can be effective during snow melting in basins with snow-rainy regimes and increasing evapotranspiration. Groundwater level changes also showed that, in the studied plains, the average water table drawdown was between 0.31 and 1.33 m/year. Therefore, the observed trend of low flow rates in this basin reflects the impact of climate change, where both direct and indirect human interference has led to the exacerbation of this situation.

J	Fox, AD; Madsen, J				Fox, Anthony D.; Madsen, Jesper			Threatened species to super-abundance: The unexpected international implications of successful goose conservation	AMBIO												Wild geese wintering in western Europe were declining by the 1930s probably due to loss of natural habitat and over exploitation through hunting, although the causes will never be known. Refuge provision and hunting restrictions from the 1950s enabled numbers to recover. Improved monitoring systems enabled the description of progressive increases and extensions of wintering range since that time, especially amongst those goose populations that increasingly exploited agricultural landscapes. This introductory article sets the scene for the special issue on the increasing interactions and conflicts created by recent increases in the range and abundance of wild geese throughout the northern hemisphere, especially with regard to agricultural damage, but including issues associated with air flight safety, human and animal health, ecosystem effects and conflicts with other biodiversity objectives. It also provides the context for finding common solutions to problems, presenting experiences from regional-, national- and flyway-coordinated management to find solutions to conflict.

The relationships between springtime Interior Alaska river ice breakup date and the large-scale climate are investigated for the Yukon, Tanana, Kuskokwim, and Chena Rivers for the 1949-2008 period. The most important climate factor that determines breakup is April-May surface air temperatures (SATs). Breakup tends to occur earlier when Alaska April-May SATs and river flow are above normal. Spring SATs are influenced by storms approaching the state from the Gulf of Alaska, which are part of large-scale climate anomalies that compare favorably with ENSO. During the warm phase of ENSO fewer storms travel into the Gulf of Alaska during the spring, resulting in a decrease of cloud cover over Alaska, which increases surface solar insolation. This results in warmer-than-average springtime SATs and an earlier breakup date. The opposite holds true for the cold phase of ENSO. Increased wintertime precipitation over Alaska has a secondary impact on earlier breakup by increasing spring river discharge. Improved springtime Alaska temperature predictions would enhance the ability to forecast the timing of river ice breakup.					; Zhang, Xiangdong/A-9711-2009; Bhatt, Uma/D-3674-2009	Zhang, Xiangdong/0000-0001-5893-2888; Bhatt, Uma/0000-0003-1056-3686; Bieniek, Peter/0000-0003-1227-2313													0894-8755	1520-0442				JAN	2011	24	1					286	297		10.1175/2010JCLI3809.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/2010JCLI3809.1													WOS:000286659600017

Evaluation of Satellite-Derived Estimates of Lake Ice Cover Timing on Linnevatnet, Kapp Linne, Svalbard Using In-Situ Data	REMOTE SENSING												Arctic lakes are sensitive to climate change, and the timing and duration of ice presence and absence (i.e., ice phenology) on the lake surface can be used as a climate indicator. In this study of Linnevatnet, one of the largest lakes on Svalbard, we compare inferences of lake ice duration from satellite data with continuously monitored lake water temperature and photographs from automatic cameras. Visible surface reflectance data from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used to observe the change in the lake-wide mean surface reflectance of Linnevatnet from 2003-2019, and smoothing splines were applied to the to determine the date of summer ice-off (also called "break-up end"-BUE). Similarly, BUE and fall ice-on (or "freeze-up end"-FUE) were determined from lake-wide mean time series of Sentinel-1 microwave backscatter from 2014-2019. Overall, the ice timing dates identified from the satellite observations agree well with the in-situ observations (RMSE values of approximately 2-7 days for BUE and FUE, depending on the method and in-situ dataset), lending confidence to the accuracy of remote sensing of lake ice phenology in remote Arctic regions. Our observations of Linnevatnet indicate that BUE dates do not have a significant trend, while FUE dates have been occurring approximately 1.5 days later per year during the study period. These results support an overall decrease in annual duration of lake ice cover in this part of Svalbard.

We have combined fluorescence of the endogenous photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll a and phycocyanin with a phosphate deficiency (beta-deficiency) related stain (enzyme-labelled fluorescence, ELF97) that yields green fluorescent precipitates at the site of phosphatase activity, referred to as ELF alcohol (ELFA) fluorescence, to sort phytoplankton from Lake Loosdrecht (The Netherlands). Stable isotope labelling with C-13-enriched CO2 enabled assessment of specific growth rates of sorted populations by pyrolytic methylation-gas chromatography and in-line compound specific isotope-ratio mass spectrometry. The dominant population in the lake, the filamentous cyanobacterium Limnothrix sp., was growing under beta-deficiency in spring, but the availability of phosphate increased in summer. Continuous flow of phosphate-rich medium into a laboratory-scale enclosure of lake water resulted in washout of the cells with ELFA fluorescence, and increased growth rates. In addition, this study revealed population heterogeneity within the cluster of phycocyanin-containing cyanobacteria. ELFA fluorescence thus reflects the level of beta-deficiency of freshwater cyanobacteria and microalgae, but is modulated by metabolic activity of cells within the population.																			0948-3055					NOV 11	2004	37	2					159	169		10.3354/ame037159	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame037159													WOS:000225503700005

N and P species in the dusts were determined. Results indicated that the annual ADD flux (ADDF) of dusts was 215.64 g m (2) yr(-1), 48% of which occurred in March and April. The annual ADDF of N was 7.98 kg ha (-1)yr(-1), 49% of which was water-soluble total nitrogen, including 23%, 16%, and 10% of water-soluble NH4+-N, NO3- N, and organic N, respectively. The annual ADDF of the total P was 1.72 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), only 6% of which was water-soluble. The dusts as well as the N and P in the dusts primarily originated from western Inner Mongolia and northern Gansu, driven by the winter monsoon. However, relatively high concentrations of N and P in the dusts in summer might be related to the southeast Asian monsoon from southern Gansu and northern Sichuan. Overall, the ADDF of the total N was about half of the atmospheric wet deposition flux (AWDF) of N, while the ADDF of the total P was approximately equal to the AWDF of P. However, most of the P in the dusts was not water-soluble and thus not readily bioavailable. Therefore, N and P wet deposition provides most of the readily available nutrients to phytoplankton in Lake Qinghai.					zhang, xuan/GQO-8953-2022														1309-1042					JUL	2022	13	7							101481	10.1016/j.apr.2022.101481	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apr.2022.101481		JUN 2022											WOS:000824461800005
J	Jiang, Z; Shao, MQ; Wang, JY				Jiang, Zeng; Shao, Mingqin; Wang, Jianying			Simulation of Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Suitable Wintering Habitat for Hooded Crane (Grus monacha) Under Climate and Land Use Change Scenarios	ANIMALS												In the context of global warming and intensified human activities, the loss and fragmentation of species habitats have been exacerbated. In order to clarify the trends in the current and future suitable wintering areas for hooded cranes (Grus monacha), the MaxEnt model was applied to predict the distribution patterns and trends of hooded cranes based on 94 occurrence records and 23 environmental variables during the wintering periods from 2015 to 2024. The results indicated the following. (1) The elevation (Elev, 43.7%), distance to major water (DW, 39.5%), minimum temperature of the coldest month (Bio6, 9.7%), and precipitation of the wettest month (Bio13, 2.6%) were dominant factors influencing the wintering distribution of hooded cranes. (2) Under current climate and land use scenarios, highly suitable areas for hooded cranes in China cover approximately 1.274 x 105 km2, primarily located in inland lakes such as Dongting Lake, Liangzi Lake, Poyang Lake, Shengjin Lake, and Caizi Lake in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, as well as in coastal wetlands such as Chongming East Beach, Shandong Peninsula, Bohai Bay, and Liaodong Peninsula. (3) Under future climate and land use scenarios, the suitable habitat areas (high and moderate suitability) for hooded cranes are projected to contract substantially in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and expand slightly in the areas of Shandong Peninsula, Bohai Bay, and Liaodong Peninsula. Under the SSP126 (low emissions), SSP245 (medium emissions), and SSP585 (high emissions) scenarios, the average area reduction percentages were 29.1%, 28.8%, and 31.6%, respectively. (4) The increases in Bio6 and water areas in northern China were the main reasons for the shift of the wintering distribution centroid for hooded cranes toward northeastern China. The minor expansion of suitable habitat in the north covers mainly cultivated land, and this singular foraging habitat could intensify both intraspecific and interspecific competition among waterbirds, thus exacerbating the survival risks for hooded cranes. To more effectively protect the wintering population of hooded cranes in China, the restoration of natural habitats and population monitoring in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River should be strengthened. Additionally, nature reserves or protected areas should be established in the northern expansion regions.																			2076-2615					JAN	2025	15	1							6	10.3390/ani15010006	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani15010006								39794949					WOS:001393513300001
J	LABAUGH, JW				LABAUGH, JW			WATER CHEMISTRY CHANGES DURING ARTIFICIAL AERATION OF SPRUCE-KNOB LAKE, WEST-VIRGINIA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The water mass below 3.5 m in Spruce Knob Lake was artificially aerated with a modified full lift aerator during 2 consecutive summers (1974 and 1975) of an investigation that began in July of 1973 and ended in Sept. 1975. Artificial aeration increased water temperature below 3.5 m without causing destratification. Several chemical parameters were significantly affected by artificial aeration, especially from July to autumnal overturn in 1974 and 1975. Below 3.5 m, total inorganic C, total alkalinity, nitrite, soluble reactive P and total P were lower during aeration than in the summer of no aeration (1973). Although artificial aeration lowered soluble reactive and total P, there was no significant impact on the P budget of the impoundment. In 1975, continuous aeration from vernal overturn to autumnal overturn resulted in higher nitrate concentrations below 3.5 m than in the preceeding summers. Lower pH values encountered through the whole water column in 1975 followed a brief isothermal interruption of summer stratification in early June. There was no direct effect of artificial aeration on either temperature or water chemistry parameters in the epilimnion. Significantly lower chlorophyll concentrations observed in 1975 were related to destratification in June. Primary production was unaffected by aeration.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1980	70	3					201	216		10.1007/BF00016762	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00016762													WOS:A1980JV14300002

We examined winter drawdown effects on macroinvertebrate abundance and community composition in reservoirs while accounting for localized physical variables that might explain additional variability. We hypothesized that drawdown would affect the abundance and the community composition of macroinvertebrates because of the exposure of organisms to freezing and desiccation. However, we expected the detection and magnitude of these responses to be conditional on localized physical habitat variables (i.e., fetch, thermal condition and slope), which also influence abundance and community composition of macroinvertebrates. To test these hypotheses, we applied generalized linear mixed effects models and multivariate analyses to data collected from 118 samples in 15 temperate reservoirs. Sampling stations from reservoirs that experienced high winter drawdown and/or were below the thermocline showed significantly lower macroinvertebrate abundances. Changes in community composition across sites were muted as chironomids, oligochaetes and sphaeriids dominated all assemblages. Decreases in macroinvertebrate abundances with drawdown amplitude and lower temperatures (i.e., hypolimnion) could have implications for food web structure, as they substantially contribute to fish diet, and ecosystem functions (e.g., nutrient cycling).

The state of Lake Simcoe (Ontario, Canada): the effects of multiple stressors on phosphorus and oxygen dynamics	INLAND WATERS												Lake Simcoe, the largest lake in southern Ontario outside of the Laurentian Great Lakes, is affected by numerous stressors including eutrophication resulting from total phosphorus (TP) loading, climate change, and invasions of exotic species. We synthesized the long-term responses of Lake Simcoe to these stressors by assessing trends in water quality and biological composition over multiple trophic levels. Evidence for climate change included increasing thermal stability of the lake and changes in subfossil diatom communities over time. Although the deep water dissolved oxygen (O-2) minimum has increased significantly since TP load reductions, it is still below estimated historical values and the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan end-of-summer target level of 7 mg O-2 L-1. Low deep water O-2 concentrations corresponded with a decline in coldwater fish abundance. Since 1980, some nutrient concentrations have decreased (spring TP) while others have increased (silica), but many show no obvious changes (ice-free TP, nitrate, ammonium). Increases in water clarity, combined with declines in chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biovolumes in Cook's Bay, were temporally consistent with declines in TP loading and the lake-wide establishment of dreissenid mussels as a major component of the Lake Simcoe ecosystem. Using an investigative tool, we identified 2 periods when abrupt shifts potentially occurred in multiple parameters: 1986 and 1995-1997. Additional ecosystem level changes such as declines in zooplankton, declines in offshore benthic invertebrate abundance, and increased nearshore invertebrate abundance likely reflect the effects of invasive species. The interaction of these multiple stressors have significantly altered the Lake Simcoe ecosystem.					; Jarjanazi, Hamdi/B-6221-2011; Smol, John/A-8838-2015; Longstaffe, Fred/A-6843-2008	Schwalb, Astrid/0000-0001-8567-5012; Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; Rennie, Michael/0000-0001-7533-4759; Longstaffe, Fred/0000-0003-4103-4808; 													2044-2041	2044-205X					2013	3	1					51	74		10.5268/IW-3.1.529	http://dx.doi.org/10.5268/IW-3.1.529													WOS:000318267100006

Egg size data, obtained by water-displacement during hatchery egg inventories, ranged from 4.2 to 6.6 eggs/mL over the 23years. However, linear regression of data from either pooled lots of eggs (y = 0.0035x - 1.8116; P = 0.727) or individual spawns (y = 0.0003x + 5.3037; P = 0.907) indicated no significant change in mean egg size over time. The lack of change in egg size of Lake Oahe fall Chinook Salmon over the 23years of this study indicates there was no hatchery-induced evolutionary impacts on egg size.

J	Ke, D; Healy, T; Lü, SC				Ke, Dong; Healy, Terry; Lu Shi-Cheng			Carrying Capacity of Red-crowned Cranes in the National Yancheng Nature Reserve, Jiangsu, China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY & DEVELOPMENT												The coastal-zone wetland in Yancheng, Jiangsu Province is the largest winter habitat of the Red-crowned Crane (Grus japonensis) in the world. The essential research question addressed in this paper is: What is the carrying capacity for Red-crowned Cranes in this habitat? Since water is ample in the salt marsh, the two vital limiting factors for the crane habitat are food and shelter. In this study, based upon crane numbers and their distribution during the winter of 2004-2005, the authors adopt the "Neu technique" to analyze habitat selection of Red-crowned Cranes to 8 types of tidal flat environments in the Yancheng Nature Reserve. Applying the "heat quantity method", we find corn feed distributed by the nature reserve staff cannot support survival of wild cranes. Subsequently, using the "gravimetric method", with the crane utilization of each habitat as a weighting, we estimate that total food supply in the nature reserve is far greater than required by the crane population in one winter season. This indicates that food supply is not a determining factor for this particular habitat selection. Moreover, from analysis of food selectivity it is evident that the preferred food comprises vegetal paddy chaff and supplemental corn feed, with natural vegetation occupying only a small proportion of their total food consumption. The spatial distribution of cranes was between 0.8-2.5 individuals per km(2), so that an optimum habitat of 1000 km(2) may contain 800-2500 cranes. Observations from the present study show that preferred spatial location has shrunk in the past 10 years toward a core area surrounded by a buffer area (641 km(2) in all), so that potentially the entire nature reserve could support similar to 570-2000 cranes. In addition, some 500 cranes are contained within an artificial waterfowl lake. In total it appears that the carrying capacity of the Yancheng Nature Reserve is of order 2500-3000 cranes, and they prefer to roost in a coastal habitat of lower salinity where food supply is plentiful, and which is distant from human disturbance.																			0972-9984	0973-7308				WIN	2009	12	1					75	87																WOS:000420124100007

We present the results of multi- proxy analyses of a middle-late Holocene aeolian section in the SETP, together with the probability density of the ages of various cultural sites within and around the study area. Quartz optically stimulated luminescence dating provides a reliable chronology for this section, and analyses of geochemical elements, color and grain size are used to reconstruct the pattern of climate change during the middle-late Holocene. The results suggest a trend of gradually decreasing moisture from the middle Holocene (similar to 6 ka) onwards, followed by a slight increase at similar to 2 ka, which is supported by TraCE-21 ka simulation results. These changes were closely related to variation in the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) caused by decreasing Northern Hemisphere summer insolation and an increase in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. The variations in dust activity are inversely related with moisture and there was a significant decrease in dust activity after similar to 2 ka. The drought conditions during the 4.2 ka event recorded within the section appear to be a continuation of the trend of middle-late Holocene climatic deterioration, which is superimposed on a weakening trend of the ISM. The permanent human occupation of the study area after similar to 2 ka corresponded to an interval of mild and wet climate when dust activity was relatively weak. An observed correlation between the intensity of human activity and dust storms suggests that the enhancement of human activities played a significant role in increasing the occurrence of dust storms. Overall, our results provide new insights into human-environmental interactions in the SETP.

J	Pitt, KA; Kingsford, MJ				Pitt, KA; Kingsford, MJ			Reproductive biology of the edible jellyfish Catostylus mosaicus (Rhizostomeae)	MARINE BIOLOGY												The reproductive biology of the jellyfish Catostylus mosaicus (Quoy and Gaimard 1824) (Scyphozoa: Rhizostomeae) was investigated in New South Wales, Australia. Medusae were gonochoristic. There was a 1:1 ratio of male and female medusae and there was no evidence of sexual dimorphism. Oocytes arose from the gastrodermis and maintained contact with the gastrodermis, via trophocytes, throughout gametogenesis. Spermatogenesis occurred within follicles that arose from invagination of the gastrodermis. Detailed sampling of gonads over a period of 3.25 yr in Botany Bay, and over 2.5 yr in Lake Illawarra, indicated that gametogenesis occurred almost continuously during the year. Oocytes were smaller, or were absent from the ovaries during 3 of the 4 winters sampled at Botany Bay and during all 3 winter periods sampled at Lake Illawarra. Comparisons were made with other locations, although these were sampled less frequently. When medusae were present at a location, similar trends were observed. The size at which medusae matured varied, but during non-winter periods and at two locations, all medusae exceeding 130 mm diam were considered mature.

J	PENNAK, RW				PENNAK, RW			THE DYNAMICS OF FRESH-WATER PLANKTON POPULATIONS	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												The general composition arid nutritional interrelationships of the fresh-water plankton ecosystem are discussed, with emphasis on the role of bacteria. Although a bimodal annual plankton curve, with spring and autumn pulses, is characteristic of some lakes of medium to large area and depth, conditions in smaller and shallower lakes may be highly variable. Year-round studies on northern Colorado lakes showed no pulses, or 1, 2, or 3 pulses at various other times of the yr. Recent trends in the study of environmental factors influencing the quantitative and qualitative composition of the plankton are based on the interaction of many factors, some of which are difficult to measure. The significance of nutrients as limiting factors, ratios of ions, trace elements, and the probable biochemical significance of some of the many dissolved organic compounds are emphasized. The major portion of the food of zooplankters consists of detritus rather than living algae. There is little evidence that the grazing of zooplankton has an important effect on the control of phytoplankton populations under natural conditions, and there are seldom any numerical relationships between pulses of zooplankton and phytoplankton. Much fundamental research remains to be done on food requirements and special food habits of zooplankters, reproductive rates of all groups of plankters under varying environmental conditions, intra- and interspecific competition, and optimum densities. Representative measurements of plankton production should be based on a consideration of year-round, rather than seasonal, conditions. The mean annual standing crop is a general index which reflects the sum total of ecological conditions in a lake. It may be expressed in a variety of ways, including total seston per liter or hectare of lake surface, number of algae per liter, and zooplankters per liter. Total seston is probably the most significant means of expression for purposes of comparative limnology. When more details of the dynamics of the plankton ecosystem have been established, it should be possible to utilize mean annual standing crop data for the calculation of rate of production at the various trophic levels with reasonable accuracy.																			0012-9615	1557-7015					1946	16	4					339	355		10.2307/1961640	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1961640													WOS:A1946YF70700004

In south-west France, the increasing abundance of gravel pits has allowed several bird species to colonize the region. These "new" wetlands have become substitutes for the natural habitats of waterbirds. Coots (Fulica atra L. 1758) colonised the Midi-Pyrenees area when gravel pits were created in the 1970's. Coot populations were censused weekly from October 1996 to February 1997 and from October 1997 to February 1998 on three gravel pits near Toulouse, SW France. Each winter, the number of coots was recorded on each gravel pit, and the microhabitat used by coots identified according to environmental variables (water depth, bank slope, bank vegetation, vegetation between watermarks, macrophytes, human disturbance, zones of open water or near the bank). Open water, which constitutes a secure habitat for this species during the wintering period, abundance of macrophytes (Characea) and presence of lawn on the bank appear as the most important factors influencing coot distribution. This information will be useful for site acquisition for nature conservation and management purposes.					mastrorillo, sylvain/T-4432-2019	Santoul, Frederic/0000-0002-2932-2172													0777-6276					JAN	2004	134	1					5	8																WOS:000220600000001

Comparison of Size, Terminal Fall Velocity, and Density of Bighead Carp, Silver Carp, and Grass Carp Eggs for Use in Drift Modeling	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Invasive Asian carp established in the United States spawn in the turbulent water of rivers, and their eggs and early larvae develop while drifting in the current. The eggs, which are believed to perish if they settle before hatching, are slightly denser than water and are held in suspension by water turbulence. It is possible to use egg drift modeling to assess the capability of a river to support the survival of Asian carp eggs. Detection of spawning and estimation of egg abundance in the drift are typically assessed by ichthyoplankton trawls. Correct sampling design and interpretation of trawl data require knowledge of the vertical distribution of eggs in the drift, which can be accomplished with particle transport models. Data that are required to populate models of egg drift and vertical distribution include physical properties of assessed rivers and information on egg size, density, and terminal fall velocity, but data on these egg characteristics have not been previously available. Physical characteristics of the eggs are presented as a function of postfertilization time. We recorded mean egg diameter and terminal fall velocity for eggs from each Asian carp species during the first 5 h of development and at approximately 12 and 22 h postfertilization. Eggs of all species reached their maximum size before 4 h. Water-hardened eggs of Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Grass Carp Ctenopharyngodon idella were similarly sized in our trials, and water-hardened eggs of Bighead Carp H. nobilis were the largest. After water hardening, Silver Carp eggs sank slowest, and Bighead Carp eggs sank fastest. For a given species, smaller-diameter eggs generally had faster terminal fall velocities and higher specific gravity than larger eggs. We provide regression models of egg density and diameter for all three species, discuss usage of these data in modeling the drift and dispersion of Asian carp eggs, and discuss implications for egg sampling design.					; Chapman, Duane/JOK-2415-2023	George, Amy/0000-0003-1150-8646; Garcia, Tatiana/0000-0002-1979-7246; Chapman, Duane/0000-0002-1086-8853													0002-8487	1548-8659					2017	146	5					834	843		10.1080/00028487.2017.1310136	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2017.1310136													WOS:000408773500002

The experimental comparative work included a geographic gradient covering Baltic, Mediterranean, and NE Atlantic waters and a NE Atlantic gradient in state of eutrophication. COMWEB has been an experimental approach to coastal eutrophication, studying effects of enhanced nutrient supply on components and flows of the entire lower pelagic food web. Flow network representations of pelagic food webs has been a framework of data reduction and flows were established by sophisticated inverse modelling. Fundamental information on physiological properties of functional key species in the pelagic food web was used to constrain flow estimations. A main conclusion derived from the flow networks was that very little energy and materials were transferred from the microbial food web to the main food chain. The lower food web could therefore be described as two parallel food chains with relatively limited interaction between heterotrophic groups. Short-term effects of nutrient perturbations were examined in mesocosms along the geographic gradient. The response was comparable in all systems, with a stronger effect on the activity and biomass of autotrophic groups than those of heterotrophic ones. Mediterranean waters showed much lower autotrophic biomass response than Baltic and NE Atlantic waters, which responded almost equally. The response of primary production was, however, more comparable. High phytoplankton lysis rate explained this low accumulation of biomass in Mediterranean waters. The study of Atlantic coastal waters of different eutrophic states revealed that the ecological response was higher in the closed nutrient perturbed mesocosms than in open systems exposed for > 4 summer months (summer/autumn season). The Atlantic lagoon evolved gradually from the natural oligotrophic situation towards the more eutrophicated North Sea during fertilisation. The responses observed on seasonal and long-term scale (> 10 years) may therefore be equal. The differences between short-term (weeks) and intermediate-term (seasonal) responses is most likely a result of the different time scales of perturbation and observation and the variable exchange rates with surrounding waters (water dilution rate). The analysis of pelagic flow networks provided a framework of diagnostic criteria for state and quality assessment of coastal waters. The nutrient loading rates related better to estimates of biotic fluxes than to concentrations of biotic compartments and total nutrients. On the contrary, the concentration of biotic compartments, or the biomasses, related better to total nutrient concentrations. Primary production, mesozooplankton grazing and growth, fraction of primary production consumed by grazers, bacterial production relative to primary production, cycling indices, and path lengths were all well related to nutrient loading rate. Autotrophic biomass, ratio of autotrophic to heterotrophic biomass, and fraction of picocyanobacteria of total autotrophic biomass were all related to total nutrients. Some of these variables, which responded equally in all systems, have the potential of becoming unified response functions in a management model for European coastal waters. COMWEB has provided further insight into the mechanisms behind coastal eutrophication. A main achievement is the conceptual framework for unified response functions, important components of management models for nutrient emission to coastal waters. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This makes it difficult to assess whether some ice shelves are close to thresholds of stability under climate warming. Here, we present the first observations of SGLs across the entire East Antarctic Ice Sheet over multiple melt seasons (2014-2020). Interannual variability in SGL volume is >200% on some ice shelves, but patterns are highly asynchronous. More extensive, deeper SGLs correlate with higher summer (December-January-February) air temperatures, but comparisons with modelled melt and runoff are complex. However, we find that modelled January melt and the ratio of November firn air content to summer melt are important predictors of SGL volume on some potentially vulnerable ice shelves, suggesting large increases in SGLs should be expected under future atmospheric warming. Antarctic supraglacial lakes (SGLs) have been linked to ice-shelf collapse and the subsequent acceleration of inland ice flow, but observations of SGLs remain relatively scarce and their interannual variability is largely unknown. This new study shows that lake area and volume vary substantially from year-to-year around the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and between ice shelves.

J	Fernández-Aláez, C; Fernández-Aláez, M				Fernandez-Alaez, Camino; Fernandez-Alaez, Margarita			Seasonal changes in tissue nutrient concentrations of macroalgae and aquatic angiosperms in Mediterranean ponds (North-Western Spain)	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Seasonal changes in nitrogen and phosphorus content in two aquatic angiosperm species (Myriophyllum alterniflorum and Potamogeton natans) and two species of macroalgae (Chara fragilis and Nitella translucens) were investigated in three ponds located in north-western Spain. The aim of the study was to determine whether nutrient contents exhibit species-specific seasonal variation, and whether the macronutrient levels are related to the respective growth phase of the species. We hypothesized that angiosperms, due to a more developed root system contribute more to the retention of nutrients. Above-ground biomass was usually collected once a month between May 1996 and June 1997, and water samples were collected seasonally. Total nitrogen and total phosphorus in the sediment and the concentration of orthophosphate in sediment interstitial water were measured in July 1996. Both angiosperms and macroalgae presented lowest nutrient levels in summer and highest contents before or at the beginning of the growing season. In all three ponds, seasonal changes in the standing stock of nutrients were consistent with biomass development. Changes in biomass over time was the principal factor affecting the seasonal variation in macrophyte nutrient content. Macrophyte growth form and the presence of rhizoids in charophytes, in contrast to a well developed root system in angiosperms, affected the nutrient content of the different macrophyte species. We showed that in the Mediterranean ponds studied the angiosperms were able to accumulate a greater quantity of phosphorus in their biomass than the macroalgae, despite the fact that some Charophytes prolonged their growth into winter. The greater production of biomass by the angiosperms, particularly P. natans, and the greater capacity of M. alterniflorum to take up phosphorus suggests that charophytes act less as nutrient sinks in these Mediterranean ponds.

Modern coupling of atmospheric circulation and the hydrological cycle over and on the plateau can be observed and delineated, and the factors that control lake levels can be identified. Recent monitoring of lakes has shown that many have grown for decades due to higher meltwater inflow or stronger rainfall from different sources, depending on the location. The long-term dynamics of lakes, however, can be best described by using high-resolution climate archives. We focus here on the often controversial discussion of Holocene lake development and use the Bangong Co drainage basin on the western Tibetan Plateau as a case study. We aim to identify the factors that influence lake level, such as monsoonal or convective precipitation and meltwater. To accomplish this, shells of the aquatic gastropod genus Radix were collected from an early Middle Holocene sediment sequence in the Nama Chu subcatchment of the eastern Bangong Co, and sclerochronlogical isotope patterns for five shells were obtained at a weekly to submonthly resolution. Our data suggest that at ca. 7.5 ka, monsoonal rainfall was higher than it is today. However, summer precipitation was not continuous but occurred as extended moisture pulses. This result implies that the northern boundary of the SW Asian monsoon was similar to that today. We identify convective rainfall events significantly stronger than today and relate these events to higher soil moisture and larger lake surface areas under higher insolation conditions. The regional amount of meltwater corresponds with the westerly derived winter snowfall. Exceptionally heavy delta C-13 values archived in the shells were likely, at least partly, triggered by biogenic methane production. We suggest that our approach is suitable for studying other lake systems on the Tibetan Plateau from which fossil Radix shells can be obtained.

ENVI-met simulation was carried out as a key method in the study. The feasibility of such method was verified by comparing the simulation results with the actual measurement results. In the case of changes in solar radiation during the day,overall results of the study show that under the influence of the water body in Xi'an in winter, the temperature of the downwind area of the water body decreases and the relative humidity increases during 10:30am and 4:30pm, the temperature of such area increases and the relative humidity decreases during 5pm and 9am in the next day. Such effects persist as the distance to the water body is larger.

Elevational gradients during the Late-Glacial/Holocene vegetational transition in southern Bulgaria	VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY												The Late Glacial and early-Holocene vegetational history of a newly dated pollen and macrofossil diagram from Besbog, a cirque lake at 2250 m just above the forest limit in the Pirin Mountains of southwestern Bulgaria, is compared with a newly dated pollen diagram for the mire Shiroka Polyana at 1400 m in the conifer forest of the nearby Rhodope Mountains in order to investigate the chronology of major changes in the vegetation at different elevations. In the Lake Besbog record the non-arboreal pollen assemblage of the Late Glacial changed abruptly to that of Betula, Quercus and other deciduous types. The date for this change is about 11.6 ka cal B.P. The Quercus assemblage may be composed of pollen blown from intermediate elevations, to which deciduous forest had expanded because of higher summer temperatures related to high summer insolation. At Shiroka Polyana (1400 m) in the modern conifer belt, a similar change did not occur until about 8.8 ka cal B.P. The persistence of the dry steppe or steppe forest in the early Holocene at this lower site can also be attributed to high summer insolation. Thus as atmospheric temperature increased at the end of the Late Glacial, deciduous forests expanded first at intermediate elevations in the Pirin Mountains and only later in the Rhodope Mountains at lower elevations as summer insolation decreased.																			0939-6314	1617-6278				SEP	2006	15	4					333	343		10.1007/s00334-006-0049-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-006-0049-7													WOS:000239958900010

The occurrence of any refuge effect in relation to the seasonal impact of both macrophyte development and recruitment of zooplanktivorous fish was monitored over the summer months (May to September) in three lakes (Cromes Broad, Hoveton Little Broad/Pound End, and Upton Broad) of variable trophic status, fish community structure and nature and extent of macrophyte cover, in the Norfolk Broads in Eastern England. At all sites, Daphnia spp. exhibited a early summer peak of abundance but had declined rapidly by July probably as a result of predation from underyearling fish. In extensive macrophyte stands (Cromes Broad) Daphnia spp. persisted after its elimination in open water, indicating some refuge effect. At sites with macrophyte cover and/or low fish predation pressure, Daphnia spp. was replaced by Ceriodaphnia spp., both with and without Simocephalus sp., thus maintaining large populations of grazing Cladocera, apparently capable of exerting a high grazing pressure on phytoplankton. This occurred, even under high predation pressure from a relatively high density of zooplanktivorous 0+ fish (Cromes Broad), consistent with the refuge hypothesis. In addition, at this site, significant positive associations of cladoceran abundance with increasing macrophyte cover were apparent throughout the summer. From information on the distribution of fish it is suggested that dense macrophytes offer the most suitable refuge through provision of predator-free space.																			0018-8158					JAN 17	1997	342						229	240		10.1023/A:1017091407556	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017091407556													WOS:A1997WZ13900026

To a large extent, knowledge about the ecology of lake-rearing juvenile sockeye salmon has emerged from studies of commercially important runs returning to deep nursery lakes, yet information from shallow nursery lakes (mean depth10m) is limited. We examined seasonal and ontogenetic variation in diets of juvenile sockeye salmon (N=219, 30-85mm) and an abundant potential competitor, threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus; N=198, 42-67mm), to understand their foraging ecology and potential trophic interactions in a shallow Alaska lake. This study revealed that adult insects made up 74% of all sockeye salmon diets by weight and were present in 98% of all stomachs in Afognak Lake during the summer of 2013. Diets varied temporally for all fishes, but small sockeye salmon (<60mm) showed a distinct shift in consumption from zooplankton in early summer to adult insects in late summer. We found significant differences in diet composition between sockeye salmon and threespine stickleback and the origin of their prey indicated that they also separated their use of habitat on a fine scale; however, the two species showed overlap in size selectivity of zooplankton prey. Considering that aquatic insects can be a primary resource for juvenile sockeye salmon in Afognak Lake, we encourage the development of nursery lake carrying capacity models that include aquatic insects as a prey source for sockeye salmon.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				OCT	2017	26	4					586	601		10.1111/eff.12302	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12302													WOS:000409505000008

Nitrate, an important compound for water quality assessment, has received little attention in estimates made from satellite measurements, even though it can be estimated using models generated from multispectral images. Since nitrate is a non-optically active parameter that can be correlated with optically active parameters, it was related to bands of the visible and infrared spectrum, captured in Landsat-8 images, and used to generate empirical models to estimate the spatio-temporal variation of nitrate concentration in the Playa Colorada Bay, in the state of Sinaloa Northwest Mexico. Four sampling campaigns were performed, two in spring and two in fall. Nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) concentration ranged between 0.69 and 1.80 mg/L, values higher than those recommended in the Mexican ecological criteria of water quality for the protection of marine aquatic life in coastal areas. Generated models showed a significant relationship (P < 0.05) between NO3-N and band reflectance in the infrared (band 5) and short-wave infrared (band 6 and band 7) spectra of Landsat-8 imagery. The B6 band appeared in all models selected to estimate NO3-N in the bay. These results evidence the potential of Landsat-8 images for the estimation of nitrate in the coastal waters of Sinaloa, Mexico.					; Torres-Bejarano, Franklin/AAB-6324-2022; Gonzalez Marquez, Luis Carlos/F-5164-2019; Márquez, Luis/F-5164-2019	Hansen-Rodriguez, Ivette Renee/0000-0002-0060-5304; Ahumada Cervantes, Ramiro/0000-0001-7657-9205; Gonzalez Marquez, Luis Carlos/0000-0002-3635-4201; Torres-Bejarano, Franklin/0000-0003-3144-7289													0167-6369	1573-2959				JAN	2023	195	1							108	10.1007/s10661-022-10735-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-10735-z								36376485					WOS:000883495600003
J	Straub, JO				Straub, JO			Concentrations of the UV filter ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate in the aquatic compartment: a comparison of modelled concentrations for Swiss surface waters with empirical monitoring data	TOXICOLOGY LETTERS												UV filters in Sunscreens and cosmetics protect the skin from damage through UV radiation. Many tonnes per year of UV filters are being used in Europe and will be present, at least seasonally, in detectable concentrations in surface waters similar to common pharmaceutically active substances. Predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) of ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHMC; CAS 5466-77-3) were extrapolated for Switzerland, taking into consideration substance-specific environmental fate data and marketing estimates, by crude worst-case reckoning and by applying two environmental models (Mackay Level III; USES 3.0), both configured for Swiss hydrological and area data. By worst-case reckoning the summer PEC is 70.8-81.3 ng/l while for the remaining 8 months of the year the PEC is 13.1-15.1 ng/l. The Level III model results in concentrations of 2.4 ng/l during the summer and 0.44 ng/l during the rest of the year, while the USES 3.0 model gives an average PEC for the whole year of 7.6 ng/l. Pooling summer monitoring data (90 single analyses) from the River Rhine below Basel in the year 1997 (Water Protection Board of Basel) and From Lakes Zurich and Huttner in 1998 (Poiger et al., in preparation) allowed a derivation of a probabilistic median concentration of 4.6 ng/l, a 95th-percentile concentration of 18.6 ng/l and a 99th-percentile concentration of 33.5 ng/l. The 6-fold range from the median value to the maximum calls for caution in interpreting published monitoring concentrations. Comparison of modelled PECs with realistic median concentrations shows that crude reckoning overestimates actual concentrations by a factor of about 10, probably through insufficient consideration of (further) degradation of EHMC in sewage works, surface waters, sediments or river batiks. Both computer models, in contrast, are within the same order of magnitude as the actual summer concentrations. Based on the available data, both these environmental fate and distribution models give realistic PECs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Watson, A; Nedwell, DB				Watson, A; Nedwell, DB			Methane production and emission from peat: The influence of anions (sulphate, nitrate) from acid rain	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												The influence of sulphate concentrations on the production and emission of methane in two contrasting peal sites was determined. Seasonal changes in sulphate concentrations appeared to influence the amount of organic carbon oxidised to carbon dioxide by sulphate reduction at both peat sites. For the majority of the year at both sites the amount of carbon mineralised through sulphate reduction exceeded that being transformed to methane by methanogenic bacteria, except when sulphate reduction became sulphate limited. In order to sustain the high sulphate reduction rates measured in the peat sulphide formed from dissimilatory sulphate reduction must be reoxidised rapidly to sulphate within;the peat. Laboratory experiments showed that addition of 500 mu M sulphate and 100 mu M nitrate to peat samples significantly inhibited methanogenesis. Sulphate appeared to be the more important inhibitor of methanogenesis since inhibition of methane formation occurred with additions of sulphate reflecting in situ concentrations. Supplements of either acetate and/or hydrogen in combination with molybdate to pear samples revealed that methanogenesis was hydrogen limited and that the majority of active methanogens were hydrogen-utilising methanogens. Methanogenesis in peat samples appeared to be dependant on sulphate reducing bacteria for provision of substrates. Great Dun Fell, receiving the largest sulphate loading, had the lower rates of microbial activity (methane formation and sulphate reduction rates) than Ellergower, which received less than half the annual sulphate deposition of Great Dun Fell. This implied that some other factor-possibly organic matter lability, was limiting microbial rates of methane formation and sulphate reduction at Great Dun Fell. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The whole of this inventory has been centralized and synthesized in the form of data sheets; each glacier having presented at least one event has a data sheet, containing a description of the glacier (localization and a photograph), and the description of the various listed events. The data sheets were gathered by massif (mont Blanc, Vanoise, Ecrins and the South Alps massif). After having indexed the events of glacial origin, it appeared necessary to classify them; 3 principal categories thus are distinguished: drainings of glacial lakes, falls of ice (distinguishing the falls from seracs, repetitive, from the glacial tongues ruptures or the falls of suspended glaciers, much rarer), ruptures of water pockets.																			0018-6368						1999	54	5					47	53																WOS:000081225100006
J	Higuera, PE; Briles, CE; Whitlock, C				Higuera, Philip E.; Briles, Christy E.; Whitlock, Cathy			Fire-regime complacency and sensitivity to centennial-through millennial-scale climate change in Rocky Mountain subalpine forests, Colorado, USA	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Key uncertainties in anticipating future fire regimes are their sensitivity to climate change, and the degree to which climate will impact fire regimes directly, through increasing the probability of fire, versus indirectly, through changes in vegetation and landscape flammability. We studied the sensitivity of subalpine forest fire regimes (i.e. fire frequency, fire severity) to previously documented climate variability over the past 6000years, utilizing pollen and macroscopic charcoal from high-resolution lake-sediment records in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. We combined data from the four lakes to provide composite records of vegetation and fire history within a 200km(2) study area. Rates of forest burning were relatively complacent to millennial-scale summer cooling and decreased effective moisture. Mean return intervals between fire episodes, defined over 500-year periods, generally varied between 150 and 250years, consistent with tree-ring-based estimates spanning recent centuries. Variability around these long-term means, however, was significantly correlated with variability in summer moisture (i.e. more burning with drier summers), inferred from existing lake-level and supporting palaeoenvironmental records. The most pronounced change in fire regimes was in response to decreased subalpine forest density ca. 2400cal. year BP, itself a response to regional cooling. This indirect impact of climate was followed by a decrease in charcoal production per fire, a proxy for crown-fire severity, while the long-term rate of burning remained unchanged. Over the last 1500years, increased summer evaporation and drought frequency were associated with increased fire severity, highlighting a direct link between fire and climate.Synthesis. Subalpine forest fire history reveals complacency and sensitivity of fire regimes to changing vegetation and hydroclimate over the past 6000years. Complacency is highlighted by non-varying fire frequency over millennia. Sensitivity is evident through changes in biomass burned per fire (and inferred fire severity), in response to climate-induced changes in forest density and, more recently, increased summer drought. Overall, the palaeo record suggests that (i) fire severity may be more responsive to climate change than fire frequency in Rocky Mountain subalpine forests and (ii) the indirect impacts of climate on vegetation and fuels are important mechanisms determining fire-regime response to climate change.					; Briles, Christy/B-2402-2015; Higuera, Philip/B-1330-2010	Briles, Christy/0000-0003-2596-6349; Higuera, Philip/0000-0001-5396-9956													0022-0477	1365-2745				NOV	2014	102	6					1429	1441		10.1111/1365-2745.12296	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.12296													WOS:000344333800008

Flight Activity of Cyrtobagous salviniae Calder and Sands1 in Louisiana	SOUTHWESTERN ENTOMOLOGIST												Little is known of and no flight activity has been documented for the salvinia weevil, Cyrtobagous salviniae Calder and Sands, in the United States. A bucket-type blacklight was used to determine the flight activity of the salvinia weevil in Louisiana from 2013-2015. One trap was operated during summer and early fall 2013 at the LSU AgCenter weevil rearing facility at Houma, LA. Number of weevils captured in the trap ranged from 30 (18 July) to zero (11 September). Weevils per kilogram of salvinia from the adjacent pond ranged from 9.1 (15 August) to 41.5 (8 October). Another trap was run on Cross Lake at Shreveport, LA, during 2013-2015 in conjunction with weevil releases for biological control of giant salvinia, Salvinia molesta Mitchell. During 2013, nine and six weevils were captured in the light trap on 11 and 18 September, respectively. No weevils were captured in the light trap in 2014 because of the late release of weevils in August. During 2015, weevils captured in the trap ranged from eight (week ending 1 July) to a peak of 29 weevils for the week ending 30 July. Weevils per kilogram of salvinia increased from 7.2 (27 May) to 28.4 (2 September). Weevil flight activity might occur almost continuously when abundance and nighttime temperatures are sufficiently warm. Peak flight activity, as indicated by captures in light traps, occurred mid-to late-July. More research is needed on the factors influencing weevil flight activity, duration, and distance.																			0147-1724	2162-2647				JUN	2016	41	2					313	319		10.3958/059.041.0207	http://dx.doi.org/10.3958/059.041.0207													WOS:000379227800002
J	Tibby, J				Tibby, J			Development of a diatom-based model for inferring total phosphorus in southeastern Australian water storages	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Diatom-based transfer functions for inferring epilimnetic total phosphorus (TP) have been developed from a data set of 33 southeastern Australian water storages. Regular institutional monitoring of these sites has allowed comparison of models developed from TP data covering different time periods. A model based on mean annual TP performs better than models derived from winter maximum TP, spring minimum TP or TP nearest the time of diatom sampling. A mean annual TP model (WA-PLS 2 component) has a jack-knifed diatom-inferred versus measured TP correlation coefficient (r(jack)(2)) of 0.69 and a root-mean-square-error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.246 log(10)mug TP1(-1), while alternative models have RMSEP > 0.27. Deletion of two samples with uncharacteristic species composition and environmental conditions improved performance of the mean annual TP model (r(jack)(2) = 0.74; RMSEP = 0.233 log(10) mug TP 1(-1)). Comparison with other published diatom-TP calibration models indicates that this model performs relatively well, with possible contributing factors including the extensive characterisation of TP ( with an average 15 determinations making up the annual mean) and the dominance of planktonic diatoms in most sites. Downcore application of the model will allow the reconstruction of reservoir nutrient histories since commissioning, and thus provide a basis for understanding and management of reservoirs.

Phosphorus dynamics in a small eutrophic Italian lake	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Phosphorous dynamics within Lake Sirio (NW Italy) were investigated, considering both water and sediments. The total phosphorus (TP) concentration in the water is about 79 mu g l(-1) after the winter mixing, that is in homogeneous conditions; then TP content increases up to an average of 360 mu g l(-1) in late autumn in the deep hypolimnium (30-45 m). This deep lake portion accounts for only 1/12 of the water volume. Close to the water-sediment interface, TP concentrations up to 530 mu g l(-1) are observed. Sediment sampled at depths of 20 and 33 m contains less than 2,000 mg kg(-1) of TP, whereas cores from the deepest sediments (46 m) display TP values of 2,000-4,000 mg kg(-1) at the water-sediment interface, increasing with depth to 16,000 mg kg(-1) at about 60-100 cm. In these deep sediments the main chemical form is the Al-Fe-Mn bound P (about 90% in the high TP cores) and Fe and Mn are also highly enriched (3 and 9 times more than in the shallow sediments respectively). The P-Fe association is confirmed by SEM-EDS and XRD analyses. The vertical distribution of the P content in the water column is consistent with its release from sediments, but in this hypothesis an unrealistic P release rate from 8.1 to 3.0 g m(-2)y(-1) was estimated. A more complex model is therefore proposed, involving a process of P concentration in the sediments of the central (deepest) part of the lake, and a short term sediment-water exchange. The TP vertical variability and speciation in the cores suggests a change in the sediment retention capacity, connected to the lake shift to more eutrophic conditions.

Fall diets of red-breasted Merganser (Mergus serrator) and walleye (Sander vitreus) in Sandusky Bay and adjacent waters of Western Lake Erie	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Although published studies indicate the contrary, there is concern among many sport anglers that migrating red-breasted mergansers (Mergus serrator) and other waterbirds pose a competitive threat to sport fish species such as walleye (Sander vitreus) in Lake Eric. We quantified the diet of autumn-migrant mergansers and walleye during 1998-2000 in Sandusky Bay and adjacent waters of western Lake Erie. We hypothesized that the diets of both predators would be similar in species composition, but because of different foraging ecologies their diets would differ markedly in size of prey consumed. In addition to predator samples, we used trawl data from the same general area as an index of prey availability. We found that mergansers fed almost exclusively on fish (nine species). Gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), emerald shiner (Notrapis atherinoides) and round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) were consumed in the greatest numbers, most frequently and comprised the greatest biomass. Walleye fed exclusively on fish: gizzard shad, alewife (Alosa psuedoharengus) and emerald shiner were consumed in the greatest numbers, most frequently and comprised the greatest biomass. Diet overlap between mergansers and walleye was 67% by weight and 66% by species frequency. Mean total lengths of gizzard shad, emerald shiner and round goby found in walleye stomachs exceeded those captured in trawls by 47%, on average. Mean total lengths of gizzard shad, emerald shiner and round goby were greater in walleye stomachs than in merganser stomachs. Mean total lengths of emerald shiner and round goby were less in merganser stomachs than in trawls. Our results suggest that although the diets of walleye and mergansers overlapped considerably, mergansers generally consumed smaller fish than walleye. Given the abundance and diversity of prey species available, and the transient nature of mergansers on Lake Eric during migration, we conclude that competition for food between these species is minimal.

An Evaluation of the Ichthyofauna of Old Woman Creek Estuary, a Unique Aquatic Resource	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Old Woman Creek (OWC) National Estuarine Research Reserve and State Nature Preserve is one of only a handful of protected freshwater estuaries in the nation and is one of the few undisturbed natural areas found along the Ohio shore of Lake Erie. Located at the mouth of Old Woman Creek, about 5 km. east of the city of Huron, OWC estuary represents a remnant of a once extensive costal marsh ecosystem that provides spawning and nursery habitat for many Lake Erie fishes. Fishes were collected nine times from four sites during a two year time period extending from late July 2002 to early August 2004. A total of 34 species of fish representing I I different families was collected. Two species never observed in the OWC system were collected including the invasive Apollonia melanostomus (round goby). The absence of larger piscivorous fish previously reported as common in the estuary, such as Esox lucius (northern pike) and Amia calva (bowfin), may be a result of the cumulative effects of years of siltation and the resulting habitat alteration. Spawning Oncorhynchus mykiss (rainbow trout) were observed in the estuary in April followed by the collection of juveniles the following spring and fall, providing the first documentation of successful rainbow trout reproduction in this system. This work provides current data concerning fish present in OWC estuary and contrasts this with historical data, providing a benchmark by which the effects of future environmental impacts may be assessed.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				DEC	2009	24	4					521	527		10.1080/02705060.2009.9664328	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2009.9664328													WOS:000271835100001
J	SOMMER, U				SOMMER, U			DISTURBANCE-DIVERSITY RELATIONSHIPS IN 2 LAKES OF SIMILAR NUTRIENT CHEMISTRY BUT CONTRASTING DISTURBANCE REGIMES	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Phytoplankton diversity was studied in two North German lakes of comparable nutrient chemistry but different exposure to winds. In both lakes, phytoplankton was primarily N-limited but diatoms were Si-limited. Plusssee had a very constant mixing depth during summer, while week-to-week changes of several meters were quite common in the more exposed Behler See. In Plusssee, phytoplankton biomass during summer came closer to the carrying capacity as defined by the available total N. In Plusssee there was a marked decline of diversity during the summer maximum of biomass, while this decline was less pronounced in Behler See. It is concluded that disturbances which prevented phytoplankton from reaching the carrying capacity also maintained a high level of diversity. A negative response of diversity to undisturbed conditions became apparent, after phytoplankton biomass had exceeded about 5 % of the carrying capacity.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN 10	1993	249	1-3					59	65		10.1007/BF00008843	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008843													WOS:A1993KN39000008

Water, percolating through the upper lake substrate, is charged with CO2 by bacterial oxidation of organic matter in the sediment or by microbial and root respiration in the poorly developed soil zones of the upper lake''s basin. The water is transported along faults and fractures, through quartz latite basement rock, dissolving calcium carbonate and leaching Ca2 and Na1 from andesine feldspar. Calcite is more rapidly weathered, exceeding andesine at a mole ratio from 2-3:1. Saturation of the water with respect to calcite is approached before discharge as perennial springs at 10,200 ft elevation. During subsequent surface flowage, the spring water re-equilibrates, isotopically and chemically, with atmospheric CO2.																			0022-4472						1977	47	4					1634	1642																WOS:A1977EG43600020

The response of major food-web constituents to combinations of nutrient addition and zooplanktivorous fish abundance was tested during two subsequent years in the shallow charophyte-dominated lake Naardermeer in the Netherlands, using in situ enclosures. 2. Treatment effects differed sharply between study years. In 1998, when the summer temperature was low (17-21degreesC), high algal biomass only developed at high nutrient levels in the presence of fish, but with no major effect on Chara biomass. In 1999, when the summer temperature was relatively high (20-25degreesC), algal blooms occurred at high nutrient levels regardless of fish abundance, and were associated with a drastic decline in Chara biomass. 3. Differences between years in temperature and initial zooplankton composition and biomass were likely to contribute to the varying relative importance of top-down and bottom-up effects in these enclosure experiments. 4. The results suggest that when nutrient loads are increased towards levels where the macrophyte-dominated state is being destabilised, a 'switch' is more likely to occur in warm summers.					; van Donk, Ellen/B-7272-2008	van de Bund, Wouter/0000-0002-2749-0850; van Donk, Ellen/0000-0003-3279-4936													0046-5070					DEC	2004	49	12					1565	1573		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01301.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01301.x													WOS:000225316100005

There is no consensus on the moisture sources of precipitation in the Yellow River source region during summer season. This study presents delta H-2 and delta O-18 data from 111 water samples collected from tributaries, mainstream, lakes, and groundwater across the Yellow River source region during summertime. Measured delta O-18 values of the tributaries range from -13.5 parts per thousand to -5.8 parts per thousand with an average of -11.0 parts per thousand. Measured delta O-18 values of the groundwater samples range from -12.7 parts per thousand to -10.5 parts per thousand with an average of -11.9 parts per thousand. The delta O-18 data of tributary waters display a northward increase of 1.66 parts per thousand per degree latitude. The delta O-18 data and d-excess values imply that moisture sources of the Yellow River source region during summertime are mainly from the mixing of the Indian Summer Monsoon and the Westerlies, local water recycling, and subcloud evaporation. Analysis of tributary delta O-18 data from the Yellow River source region and streamwater and precipitation delta O-18 data from its surrounding areas leads to a best-fit second-order polynomial relationship between delta O-18 and elevation over a 4,600 m elevation range. A delta O-18 elevation gradient of -1.6 parts per thousand/km is also established using these data, and the gradient is in consistence with the delta O-18 elevation gradient of north and eastern plateau. Such relationships can be used for paleoelevation reconstructions in the Yellow River source region.

However, the detailed spatial variations of the SML in mainland China over the past 2000 years are uncertain due to the lack of high-resolution paleoclimate archives. As a result, the accurate location of the SML during the transition from the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) to the Little Ice Age (LIA), as well as its impacts on ecology and society, are poorly understood. Here, we report a potential location of the SML during the late Holocene by combining data from a lake sedimentary record and a compilation of paleoclimate records from arid northern China. We find that EASM intensity was strong during the MWP and that the SML in arid northern China was roughly located along the Yinshan Mountains, Yabulai Mountains, and north of Lake Qinghai. EASM intensity dramatically weakened during the MWP-LIA transition, and the SML retreated southeastward significantly, which may have primarily but nonlinearly been a response to the reduction in solar irradiance and its associated changes in atmospheric circulation (e.g., El Nino-Southern Oscillation and Siberian High) and could have had profound impacts on hydrology, ecology, and human civilization across northern monsoonal Asia.

Due to limited use in Canada, its occurrence in the Canadian environment is likely associated with transboundary flow from the United States where 100 times more dacthal is used. To investigate its atmospheric distribution and possible sources, two sampling strategies were applied. First, polyurethane foam-disk passive air samplers were deployed across the country from the spring to summer of 2004 and 2005. Results showed highest dacthal concentrations at two sites in southern Ontario (max: 50 pg m(-3)) and much lower concentrations in other agricultural regions across Canada. Second, daily high-volume air samples were collected at a field site in north Toronto (Downsview). Sampling at this site was triggered by real-time meteorological forecast models that indicated when air flow to the site originated in the United States. Two such events, one in late June and one in late September 2005, were sampled. In both cases, elevated dacthal concentrations were captured (e.g., up to 319 pg m-3 in the June event) and they were well correlated with transboundary flow from the United States. Finally, the octanol-air partition coefficient (K-OA) of dacthal and other current-use pesticides was measured. KOA was used to derive a particle-gas partitioning coefficient (K-P) for dacthal (Log K-P = -4.1), indicating that this compound should exist mainly in the gas phase.					; Yao, Yuan/A-9150-2017; jiang, min/D-2531-2009	Tuduri, Ludovic/0000-0003-1930-6192; 													0013-936X					FEB 1	2007	41	3					688	694		10.1021/es061725r	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es061725r								17328171					WOS:000244002800014

Identifying Non-point Sources of Endocrine Active Compounds and Their Biological Impacts in Freshwater Lakes	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Contaminants of emerging concern, particularly endocrine active compounds (EACs), have been identified as a threat to aquatic wildlife. However, little is known about the impact of EACs on lakes through groundwater from onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTS). This study aims to identify specific contributions of OWTS to Sullivan Lake, Minnesota, USA. Lake hydrology, water chemistry, caged bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus), and larval fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) exposures were used to assess whether EACs entered the lake through OWTS inflow and the resultant biological impact on fish. Study areas included two OWTS-influenced near-shore sites with native bluegill spawning habitats and two in-lake control sites without nearby EAC sources. Caged bluegill sunfish were analyzed for plasma vitellogenin concentrations, organosomatic indices, and histological pathologies. Surface and porewater was collected from each site and analyzed for EACs. Porewater was also collected for laboratory exposure of larval fathead minnow, before analysis of predator escape performance and gene expression profiles. Chemical analysis showed EACs present at low concentrations at each study site, whereas discrete variations were reported between sites and between summer and fall samplings. Body condition index and liver vacuolization of sunfish were found to differ among study sites as did gene expression in exposed larval fathead minnows. Interestingly, biological exposure data and water chemistry did not match. Therefore, although results highlight the potential impacts of seepage from OWTS, further investigation of mixture effects and life history factor as well as chemical fate is warranted.					; Rosenberry, Donald/C-2241-2013	Kiesling, Richard/0000-0002-3017-1826; Rosenberry, Donald/0000-0003-0681-5641; Martinovic-Weigelt, Dalma/0000-0002-9973-4965; Schoenfuss, Heiko/0000-0001-5464-992X; WRITER, JEFFREY/0000-0002-8585-8166; 													0090-4341	1432-0703				OCT	2014	67	3					374	388		10.1007/s00244-014-0052-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-014-0052-4								24974177					WOS:000341826300006

The loss of this key component can result in turbid conditions and a loss of important ecosystem functions and services, particularly in shallow lakes. Benthivorous fish, which can increase in abundance during eutrophication, can adversely affect macrophytes through physical disturbance, cascading effects on turbidity, suspended and attached algae (phytoplankton and periphyton) and direct consumption. However, whether warming amplifies their effects on macrophytes and can trigger regime shifts remains unexplored. Here, we tested the single and combined effects of warmer water (+4.5 degrees C) and the widespread benthivorous juvenile common carp Cyprinus carpio on two different types of aquatic macrophytes in 24 mesocosms (2,500 L each). We monitored phytoplankton, periphyton, turbidity and the abundance of the submerged curly leafed pondweed Potamogeton crispus and the floating-leaved water chestnut Trapa bispinosa during their growing season. These species dominated successively in spring and summer. Warming alone advanced the growing season of P. crispus by 17 days. Juvenile carp decreased the abundance of the more palatable P. crispus, but promoted the abundance of T. bispinosa, supporting an ecosystem shift to a dominance of floating-leaved macrophytes. Fish also substantially increased water turbidity and the biomass of phytoplankton and periphyton. Warming amplified juvenile carp effects on turbidity and submerged macrophytes, but also decreased the abundance of floating-leaved macrophytes leading to an overall macrophyte decline and increase in water turbidity. Synthesis and applications. Our study provides the first experimental evidence for a warming-induced regime shift from clear-water conditions dominated by submerged or floating/floating-leaved macrophytes to a turbid state in shallow aquatic ecosystems. The regime shift was triggered by the impacts of warming on benthivorous fish (juvenile common carp) rather than on macrophytes. Lowering nutrient loading and other measures to reduce the abundance of benthivorous fish (e.g. fish removal and piscivorous fish restocking) thus may become increasingly important for the management of shallow lakes under global climate change.					; Hilt, Sabine/IUQ-1586-2023; zhang, huan/MSW-4327-2025; zhang, yan/KHC-3163-2024	Zhang, Peiyu/0000-0002-9551-3882; 													0021-8901	1365-2664				JAN	2022	59	1					165	175		10.1111/1365-2664.14040	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.14040		OCT 2021											WOS:000711233500001

The most abundant invertebrate taxonomic groups were oribatid mites, cyclopoid copepods, naidid oligochaetes, chydorid cladocerans, and chironomid larvae. The epiphytic invertebrates had seasonal patterns of abundance that were markedly different from those in temperate lakes where abundances tend to peak in the summer. In Lake Padgett, invertebrates showed strong peaks in abundance in September and October, with weaker, secondary peaks in December, March, and April. The only taxa that were most abundant in summer were oribatid mites and cyclopoid copepods. Invertebrate densities were higher on senescent shoots. In temperate lakes, abundances of epiphytic algae and invertebrate grazers tend to show strong temporal correlations, whereas, in Lake Padgett, they tended to be weakly correlated.																			0887-3593					MAR	1993	12	1					27	39		10.2307/1467682	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1467682													WOS:A1993KR24300004

Design: A random sample of abstracts for residency years 2004-2007 was selected from the American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP) Fall and Spring meetings and the regional resident conferences including: Alcalde, Great Lakes, Eastern States, Southeastern, Midwestern, and Western States. Based on an expected publication frequency of 10% and a 95% confidence interval, 161 national conference abstracts and 1335 regional conference abstracts were assessed for publication using a standardized strategy for searching for published articles in PubMed, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and Google Scholar. Assessment: The overall publication rate of residency project abstracts presented at national and regional pharmacy meetings front 2004 to 2007 was 7.3%. The publication rate of abstracts presented at ACCP meetings was 13% while the rate of those at regional residency conferences was 6.6%. Among published abstracts, 74% had pharmacy residents as fast author, 32% had pharmacy residents as corresponding authors, and 54% of publications were authored by a multidisciplinary team. Overall, 61% of these abstracts were published in peer-reviewed pharmacy journals, and 39% were published in peer-reviewed medical journals. Approximately 90% of articles were indexed in PubMed and the median time to publication was 24 months. Conclusion: Abstracts presented at national pharmacy meetings were associated with higher publication rates when compared to regional meetings. Future studies should focus on identifying barriers to publication of pharmacy resident projects and strategies to overcome them. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Contrasting cyanobacterial communities and microcystin concentrations in summers with extreme weather events: insights into potential effects of climate change	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Current climate change scenarios predict that aquatic systems will experience increases in temperature, thermal stratification, water column stability and in some regions, greater precipitation. These factors have been associated with promoting cyanobacterial blooms. However, limited data exist on how cyanobacterial composition and toxin production will be affected. Using a shallow eutrophic lake, we investigated how precipitation intensity and extended droughts influenced: (i) physical and chemical conditions, (ii) cyanobacterial community succession, and (iii) toxin production by Microcystis. Moderate levels of nitrate related to intermittent high rainfall during the summer of 2013-2014, lead to the dominance of Aphanizomenon gracile and Dolichospermum crassum (without heterocytes). Microcystis aeruginosa blooms occurred when ammonium concentrations and water temperature increased, and total nitrogen:total phosphorus ratios were low. In contrast, an extended drought (2014-2015 summer) resulted in prolonged stratification, increased dissolved reactive phosphorus, and low dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations. All A. gracile and D. crassum filaments contained heterocytes, M. aeruginosa density remained low, and the picocyanobacteria Aphanocapsa was abundant. A positive relationship (P < 0.001) was identified between microcystin quotas and surface water temperature. These results highlight the complex successional interplay of cyanobacteria species and demonstrated the importance of climate through its effect on nutrient concentrations, water temperature, and stratification.					; Hamilton, David/F-5039-2012; Atalah, Javier/AAV-9077-2021; Biessy, Laura/J-2068-2015; Dietrich, Daniel/AAP-8698-2021; Atalah, Javier/AFX-4822-2022; Borges, Hugo/KBC-4765-2024; Hamilton, David P/F-5039-2012	Puddick, Jonathan/0000-0001-7000-9180; Hawes, Ian/0000-0003-2471-6903; Atalah, Javier/0000-0003-0625-3431; Biessy, Laura/0000-0001-8749-1495; Hamilton, David P/0000-0002-9341-8777; Wood, Susanna/0000-0003-1976-8266													0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2017	785	1					71	89		10.1007/s10750-016-2904-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-016-2904-6													WOS:000388173000006

Five oligotrophic lakes in southern Sweden were sampled in late autumn. Phosphate-P and glucose-C alone or in combination (0.01 and 0.3 mg L-1, respectively) was added to 1.0 mu m filtered lake water and incubated in darkness at 20 degrees C. Additions of glucose (C) and phosphorus (P) alone did not lead to changes in the rates of bacterial metabolic processes, whereas bacterial respiration and bacterial production responded positively to C + P enrichment for most of the lakes sampled. Bacterial growth efficiency showed a wide range (2.5-28.7%) and low mean value (12%). These variations were not correlated with the DOC concentration. Our results show that heterotrophic bacterial carbon mineralization in this kind of system during autumn is conditioned by the combined availability of labile carbon and phosphorus, with the assimilated carbon mainly transformed to inorganic carbon in respiration, contributing to CO2 supersaturation in these systems.

Effects of water withdrawal from ice-covered lakes on oxygen, temperature, and fish	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												In northern regions, large volumes of water are needed for activities such as winter road construction. Such withdrawals, particularly from small lakes, can reduce oxygen concentrations and water levels, potentially affecting aquatic organisms. Withdrawal limits have been developed by regulatory agencies, but are largely theoretical. Water withdrawal thresholds were tested in two small lakes by removing 10% and 20% of their respective under-ice volumes and comparing oxygen parameters, temperature, overwintering habitat, and northern pike (Esox lucius) abundance to reference conditions. Because of a milder winter, oxygen parameters were elevated in reference lakes in the period following withdrawal compared to the prewithdrawal period. The 10% withdrawal resulted in a -0.2 m shift in the oxygen concentration profile at 4 mg/l in that lake, but had no effect on total volume-weighted oxygen, or volume of over-wintering habitat. In contrast, the 20% withdrawal caused 0.7 m reduction in the oxygen concentration profile at 4 mg/l compared to the previous year, a 26% decline in the volume-weighted oxygen concentration, and a 23% reduction in the volume of over-wintering habitat compared to prewithdrawal conditions. Water temperatures were slightly (<= 10%) colder in the upper strata in the year following the withdrawal in both withdrawal and reference lakes. Northern pike abundance was not impacted by water withdrawals in either of the lakes. The results of this study show that the effects of water withdrawal on the parameters investigated reflected the characteristics of the lakes, and would therefore be expected to vary from lake to lake. Policy development to mitigate impacts must therefore reflect the site-specific nature of water withdrawal.

Full annual cycle climate change vulnerability assessment for migratory birds	ECOSPHERE												Climate change is a serious challenge faced by all plant and animal species. Climate change vulnerability assessments (CCVAs) are one method to assess risk and are increasingly used as a tool to inform management plans. Migratory animals move across regions and continents during their annual cycles where they are exposed to diverse climatic conditions. Climate change during any period and in any region of the annual cycle could influence survival, reproduction, or the cues used to optimize timing of migration. Therefore, CCVAs for migratory animals best estimate risk when they include climate exposure during the entire annual cycle. We developed a CCVA incorporating the full annual cycle and applied this method to 46 species of migratory birds breeding in the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes (UMGL) region of the United States. Our methodology included background risk, climate change exposure x climate sensitivity, adaptive capacity to climate change, and indirect effects of climate change. We compiled information about migratory connectivity between breeding and stationary non-breeding areas using literature searches and U. S. Geological Survey banding and re-encounter data. Climate change exposure (temperature and moisture) was assessed using UMGL breeding season climate and winter climate from non-breeding regions for each species. Where possible, we focused on non-breeding regions known to be linked through migratory connectivity. We ranked 10 species as highly vulnerable to climate change and two as having low vulnerability. The remaining 34 species were ranked as moderately vulnerable. In general, including non-breeding data provided more robust results that were highly individualistic by species. Two species were found to be highly vulnerable throughout their annual cycle. Projected drying will have the greatest effect during the non-breeding season for species overwintering in Mexico and the Caribbean. Projected temperature increases will have the greatest effect during the breeding season in UMGL as well as during the non-breeding season for species overwintering in South America. We provide a model for adaptive management of migratory animals in the face of projected climate change, including identification of priority species, research needs, and regions within non-breeding ranges for potential conservation partnerships.					; Thogmartin, Wayne/A-4461-2008; Cohen, Emily/AAB-4246-2020	Cohen, Emily/0000-0002-4978-4278; Thogmartin, Wayne/0000-0002-2384-4279; , Amy/0000-0003-0192-2296; Marra, Peter/0000-0002-0508-7577													2150-8925					MAR	2017	8	3							e01565	10.1002/ecs2.1565	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.1565													WOS:000397102400007
J	CHORUS, I; SCHLAG, G				CHORUS, I; SCHLAG, G			IMPORTANCE OF INTERMEDIATE DISTURBANCES FOR THE SPECIES COMPOSITION AND DIVERSITY OF PHYTOPLANKTON IN 2 VERY DIFFERENT BERLIN LAKES	HYDROBIOLOGIA					8TH WORKSHOP OF THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOC OF PHYTOPLANKTON TAXONOMY AND ECOLOGY	JUL 05-15, 1991	BAJA, HUNGARY	INT ASSOC PHYTOPLANKTON TAXON & ECOL, KERESKEDELMI BANK, HUNGARIAN SIL GRP				Species composition and diversity of phytoplankton were studied for several years in two lakes which differ with respect to mixing conditions and nutrient limitation: Schlachtensee regularly stratifies very stably. In contrast, size and wind-exposure predispose Lake Tegel to deeper mixing; additionally, stratification is artificially destabilized by aeration. As the duration of aeration was varied, the study period includes interannual changes in mixing conditions. For both lakes, it also covers trophic change due to restoration; this was especially pronounced in Schlachtensee. Results show that mixing conditions affect species composition on two levels: on a superordinate level, lake morphology or hydrology govern stability of stratification and susceptibility to perturbation, and hence the extent to which motile species can develop. In Schlachtensee, species with some means of actively seeking preferred depths usually dominated during summer stratification: Planktothrix agardhii during the hypertrophic phase, and flagellates since restoration. In contrast, in Lake Tegel deeper mixing as a generally prevailing condition favored non-motile species. Their seasonal pattern was remarkably constant from year to year. Although changes in the extent of mixing were pronounced during the four years studied (1987-1990), these were within a range that affected species composition only slightly: in summer, cyanobacteria and diatoms represented 'climax species' whose dominance was not offset by additional, weather-induced increases of turbulence. On a subordinate level, and within the constraints set by nutrient limitation as well as by grazing pressure, small-scale changes in mixing conditions caused by meteorological cycles were shown to strongly affect species composition and in consequence diversity: Results for the fouryear post-restoration study period at Schlachtensee show that considerable interannual variations of species composition and diversity can be attributed to variations in the frequency of meteorological changes. In accordance with the 'intermediate disturbance hypothesis' (IDH), diversity was lowest during 1989, the year with the longest and most pronounced cycles of fair weather (14 to 27 fair days on end). However, the mechanism for this was rarely a decline of diversity caused by competitive exclusion within single long phases of stable conditions, as conceived by the 'intermediate disturbance hypothesis'. Instead, diversity responded to changes in mixing conditions with a variety of patterns - often with low values during phases of increased mixing and with high values under quiescent conditions, especially during the first calm days just after increased mixing. Thus, not disturbance as such, but rather the rate of change between phases of disturbance and quiescence appears to determine the frequency of high diversity indices. In Lake Tegel, high diversity indices were somewhat more frequent in 1989, the year during which thermal stratification was most stable. For species adapted to frequent or continuous mixing, interjected calm phases with unusually high stability of thermal stratification may represent a 'disturbance' of accustomed conditions. Thus, in turbulent Lake Tegel, meteorological cycles appear to act in reversal to the IDH, in a sense which may be termed 'intermediate quiescence hypothesis'. Phosphorus limitation due to successful restoration was found to decrease winter and vernal diversity in Schlachtensee. Presumably, without nutrient constraints, new populations could grow more rapidly in response to the rapid changes of physical parameters during this season. In contrast, restoration has increased summer diversity, as phosphorus concentrations no longer allow the virtual monocultures of Planktothrix agardhii which prevailed previously. In Lake Tegel, the reduction of phosphorus concentration down to 60 mug/l P in 1989 limited biomass, but this level was still too high to significantly alter species composition or diversity.

Due to excellent water clarity, and consistent temperatures and flows, a diverse community of native and nonnative aquatic plants have developed, including Hydrilla verticillata. Samples were collected quarterly of floating plant fragments to determine biomass loadings, fragment counts and establishment of propagules. The biomass loadings and establishment will be discussed in this paper. Hydrilla fragment biomass loadings were significantly greater in March for site 1 (downstream of Spring Lake) due to the presence of a harvester on Spring Lake, which are the headwaters of the San Marcos River. Additionally, there was a significant increase in plant fragment biomass at site 3 which is located directly below several high recreational use areas on the San Marcos River for the September and June sampling periods. Hydrilla fragments collected from the river, transported to the LAERF and planted, were able to establish between 70 and 83% of all plants.																			0146-6623					JAN	2001	39						75	79																WOS:000174564800020
J	van Someren, VD				van Someren, VD			The factors conditioning the rising of trout (Salmo trutta) in a small fresh water lake	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												Observations were made daily during the late spring and early summer for 2 yrs. of the evening rising of trout after surface food, mainly insect imagos. Correlations were made with various ecol. conditions. Since the most of the food of the trout is obtained below the surface of the water, chiefly insect larvae, crustaceans, and snails, the rising involves both a change of diet and of behavior. The rise may involve many fish simultaneously and usually occurs the 2d half hr. after sundown. Good rising is favored by low temps., 52[degree]-61[degree]F, and high O2 content of the water, and is limited by the reverse of these factors and by low number of surface organisms. The abundance of these latter are reduced by strong winds, mist over the water, rain at the time of rise, and perhaps turbidity. When other conditions are unfavorable, rain during the day is beneficial but has the reverse effect when the other conditions are favorable. A thundery atmosphere is detrimental to rising but its action is obscure. Direction of wind, surface ripple, state of the sky, barometric pressure, and phases of the moon are unimportant. Light is the most important factor regulating the time of rising if other conditions are favorable. A combination of favorable factors is important in influencing a rise; any 1 factor may limit its occurrence.																			0021-8790	1365-2656					1940	9						89	107																WOS:000201318000008
J	White, MD				White, MD			Horizontal distribution of pelagic zooplankton in relation to predation gradients	ECOGRAPHY												An investigation was conducted examining the horizontal and vertical distribution of zooplankton in Lake Miramar. a southern California reservoir. Daphnia and Mesocyclops clops populations were most abundant offshore and in deeper water during the day but appeared to move toward shore and upward at night. The results of inshore zooplankton sampling provided no evidence that the diel horizontal migration pattern was a result of sampler avoidance by zooplankton. Inshore-offshore differences in Daphnia and Mesocyclops abundance and diel migrations were reduced during winter and early spring. Rotifer zooplankters exhibited less seasonal variation in their horizontal distributions than did the large crustacean zooplankters at all times of the year. It is hypothesized that the spatial distribution of zooplankton is related to predation gradients in Lake Miramar. The dominant planktivore in the reservoir. young-of-the-year Micropterus salmoides, was abundant from late May through December and much less so from January to early May, They were largely restricted to the littoral zone and this produced horizontal gradients of planktivory which varied in strength seasonally and from day to night. It appears that crustacean zooplankton in Lake Miramar avoid areas with abundant planktivores during the day but migrate into these areas at night when the intensity of planktivory is reduced. Rotifers exhibit less horizontal heterogeneity and no significant diel migrations, which is attributed to the reduced risk of predation that rotifers experience relative to crustacean zooplankters. A graphical model is proposed to integrate our understanding of diel vertical and horizontal migrations of zooplankton. In this model, gradients of predation are completely vertical in offshore areas and strongly horizontal in near shore areas. Gradients of food availability are roughly similar to those of predation intensity. Plankters respond to these gradients by migrating in a path parallel to gradients of predation at dawn and parallel to gradients of food availability after dark.

Results were correlated with winter survivals in the lake itself. The organisms were more resistant to extended anaerobiosis at 0[degree] and 5[degree] than at 10[degree]. Specimens of Chaoborus, Chironomus, Palpomyia and Tubifex were able to survive 120 days of anaerobiosis in mixed populations at the lower temps. The 3 most common spp. of Chironomus showed the following order of tolerance: plumosus > decorus > lobiferus. Microbenthic organisms gradually disappeared with extended anaerobiosis; certain colorless flagellates appeared to be most resistant. The results indicated that none of the organisms studied are able to endure anaerobiosis indefinitely, with the possible exception of certain colorless flagellates.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				JAN	1942	23	1					1	13		10.2307/1930867	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1930867													WOS:000200150000001

To improve understanding of multi-temporal patterns of riverine N and P export and their hydro-biogeochemical controls over both episodic events and long-term trend, we analyzed and interpreted high -frequency data of total nitrogen (TN), ammonia-nitrogen (NH4-N), and total phosphorus (TP) provided by an automatic water quality monitoring station in a typical agricultural catchment draining to Lake Chaohu, China. Mann-Kendall test revealed a significant decreasing trend of riverine N and P concentration most of the time during 2018-2020. At the sub-daily scale, intraday TN concentrations varied by more than 1 mg/L in 31.8% of the period. Monthly TN and TP concentrations were particularly high in December 2019, indicating combined effect of hydrologic (long dry antecedent period and subsequent intensive rainfall events) and anthropogenic controls (fertilization and agricultural drainage). Significantly higher TN concentrations in winter and TP con-centrations in summer reflected coupled dominances of precipitation and temperature on hydrologic and biogeochemical processes. Rainfall events with very heavy intensity drove disproportionate N and P loads (more than 20% of the total export) in only 3.2% of the period. Moderate and very heavy events registered the highest TN and TP concentrations, respectively. Our results highlighted the importance of automatic water quality monitoring station to reveal dynamics of riverine N and P export, which may imply future nutrient loading abatement plans for lake-connected catchment.

However, due to limitations in monitoring technologies and interdisciplinary research, most existing studies have mostly been confined to specific media (e.g., surface water) or individual pollutants. As a result, comprehensive screening and risk assessment of hormone-disrupting chemicals (HDCs) across the entire aquatic ecosystem chain in megacities remains lacking. To address this gap, we developed high-throughput sample pretreatment methods and established a suspect screening and identification strategy based on a custom-built electronic identity database for 86 HDCs. This strategy was first validated in a typical megacity. The results showed that 17.85% of 406 samples collected from four rivers and three lakes tested positive, with 24 different HDCs identified. Estrogens were detected in all matrices, while glucocorticoids showed significant concentrations in surface water, sediments, and suspended solids. Spatiotemporal analysis indicated higher concentrations in spring and summer, showed a progressive increase downstream. Source-sink analysis identified domestic sewage, medical wastewater, and aquaculture wastewater as the primary pollution sources. Hexestrol, Penbutolol, and Cortisone acetate were identified as priority control targets. This study enhances our understanding of HDCs and supports their assessment and management in global megacity aquatic ecosystems.

However, its stopover habitat receives little attention and is not well known or protected even. Here, we present the spatial distribution of the stopover habitats for hooded cranes in the East Asia. A machine learning modeling algorithm of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) weas applied and evaluated with Stochastic Gradient Boosting and Random Forests based on 115 every year used occurrence points (1990-2013) and 14 environmental layers as predictors. Results show that the Songnen Plain and Korea Peninsula are the most important stopover habitats. Four other major areas are also suitable for stopover: (i) the coastal area of the Bohai Sea, (ii) the Three Rivers Plain-Amur River Basin, (iii) the Torey Lake Basin and the (iv) Zeya River-Heilongjiang River. The gap analysis revealed that existing nature reserves conserve merely 16.7% of the suitable habitat and 26.7% of the core habitat. However, much more suitable habitat is still located widely outside nature reserves. Based on our predictions, a total of 22 priority areas should be considered when developing new nature reserves or expanding the existing nature reserves. In addition, we suggest that seven regions located at the Korean Peninsula are also suitable for dispersing hooded cranes from Izumi, Japan. Artificial feeding, including setting up feeding stations with grain, artificial cranes (decoys) and artificial flowing water impoundments can be used to attract wintering hooded cranes at these seven sites. Theoretically, our models show that these habitats can accommodate approximately 3,713 wintering individuals (ca. 35% of the wintering population in Izumi).

By comparison of independent data sets, general climatic changes were demonstrated. Lithological, chemical and stable isotope data reveal two significant climatic oscillations at ca. 12 200-12 000 and ca. 11 000-10 200 yr BP respectively. Continental climatic conditions, indicated by evaporative enrichment of O-18 in lake marl, characterise parts of the early lake history, including the Older Dryas Stadial. Distinct variations of deltaC-13 in organic material is discussed in terms of climatically induced changes in lake-water chemistry. Different types of photosynthetic assimilation of dissolved inorganic carbon is proposed as a contributing factor influencing lake marl deltaC-13. The universal application of a positive correlation between lake marl deltaO-18 and mean annual air temperature is questioned. Quantifications of mean summer and winter temperatures based on beetle analysis show a climatic optimum around 12 000 yr BP, a marked cooling around 11 000 yr BP and a strong amelioration at ca. 10 200 yr BP. These climatic events were accompanied by distinct changes in aquatic vegetation. Plant macrofossil and insect analyses indicate an open vegetation during the entire period studied. Biostratigraphical data reflecting local limnic and terrestrial vegetation and regional climate facilitate the interpretation of stable isotope data.					; Hammarlund, Dan/B-9698-2008	Hammarlund, Dan/0000-0001-7147-8173; 													0267-8179					MAR	1994	9	1					13	31		10.1002/jqs.3390090103	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jqs.3390090103													WOS:A1994NF74100002

Duration and severity of Medieval drought in the Lake Tahoe Basin	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Droughts in the western U.S. in the past 200 years are small compared to several megadroughts that occurred during Medieval times. We reconstruct duration and magnitude of extreme droughts in the northern Sierra Nevada from hydroclimatic conditions in Fallen Leaf Lake, California. Stands of submerged trees rooted in situ below the lake surface were imaged with sidescan sonar and radiocarbon analysis yields an age estimate of similar to 1250 AD. Tree-ring records and submerged paleoshoreline geomorphology suggest a Medieval low-stand of Fallen Leaf Lake lasted more than 220 years. Over eighty more trees were found lying on the lake floor at various elevations above the paleoshoreline. Water-balance calculations suggest annual precipitation was less than 60% normal from late 10th century to early 13th century AD. Hence, the lake's shoreline dropped 40-60 m below its modern elevation. Stands of pre-Medieval trees in this lake and in Lake Tahoe suggest the region experienced severe drought at least every 650-1150 years during the mid- and late-Holocene. These observations quantify paleo-precipitation and recurrence of prolonged drought in the northern Sierra Nevada. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Statistical modeling of the PM2.5-Albedo-Streamflow relationship in Parley's Creek, Utah using MODIS albedo data	World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2015: Floods, Droughts, and Ecosystems					World Environmental and Water Resources Congress	MAY 17-21, 2015	Austin, TX	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm and Water Resources Inst				There has been growing focus on the impact of dust deposition on the hydrology of snowmelt-fed watersheds. Recent studies have indicated that dust deposition can vary the albedo or reflectivity of snow, leading to changes in the melt dynamics and subsequent variations in the flow rates of mountain streams. Lower albedo causes the snow to melt sooner, causing spring snowmelt to occur as early as late winter. Such variations can throw water management plans into disarray, and might also lead to events such as floods and droughts. This study aims to demonstrate the suitability of using NASA's MODIS dataset, particularly the MCD43 suite of albedo products, in understanding past patterns and predicting future variations in stream flows from watersheds impacted by urban air pollution. Satellite data allows researchers to avoid expensive and time-consuming ground measurements, and also to understand spatial and temporal phenomena in difficult-to-reach mountain watersheds. Two statistical models are developed for Parley's Creek, located near Salt Lake City, relating stream flow observations to an air quality parameter (PM 2.5) and MODIS albedo data. The Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) framework is used to develop these models, and robust optimization using k-fold cross validation is used to find the best fit that will generalize to new data.

Electroplating with Ag provides a mirror-like surface essential for optimal performance. Miniature sensors were constructed using disposable pipette tips with 0.6 mm outer diameter. The reproducibility was +/- 0.11% (n = 9) and the response time (tau(90)) was 3-5 s. Selectivities for interfering anions were extremely high, and no interference by HS- was observed. The detection limit was determined with a continuous flow gradient dilution system and was found to be around 10(-20) moles S2- l(-1). The sensor was applied to the in situ measurements of sulfide concentration gradients at the sediment-water interface of a highly eutrophic lake. Concentration profiles from below the detection Limit up to several micromoles were recorded within a layer of 2 mm. The flux of S(-II) from the sediment to the adjacent water was 0.5 x 10(-4) to 1.0 x 10(-4) moles (S-II) m(-2) per day in winter when oxygen was mixed down to the sediment surface, and 1.8 x 10(-2) (S-II) m-2 per day in summer when the bottom water was devoid of oxygen.

J	Forsey, ES; Baggs, EM				Forsey, ES; Baggs, EM			Winter activity of mammals in riparian zones and adjacent forests prior to and following clear-cutting at Copper Lake, Newfoundland, Canada	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												A study of winter tracks was carried out to determine mammal usage of boreal habitats in response to clear-cutting on three headwater streams. species considered were the endangered Newfoundland marten (Martes americana atrata). short-tailed weasel (Mustela erminea). red fox (Vulpes vulpes). red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). and the snowshoe hart: (Lepus americanus). Track abundances were significantly (p<0.05) higher in the forest interior than in riparian habitats. A shift in activity on the transects was noted following prescribed cutting. Tracks were more abundant along transects within riparian buffers than along those within clear-cut/open areas. A significant change in activity (displacement) of the pine marten was recorded. The results suggested that for environmentally sensitive species, i.e., American marten, small disturbances or alterations in habitat caused immediate and significant effects. <(c)> 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The Case Study of Lake Garda	WATER												The nematode Eustrongylides excisus is a parasite of freshwater fish- and fish-eating birds, with known differences on prevalence values among fish species. Thus, the present study aims to explore the hypothesis that the feeding behavior and the size of fish belonging to different trophic levels could explain such differences. For that, 14 sampling sites were selected to perform a fish parasitological survey on Lake Garda (Italy) during spring-summer 2020. Amplification of nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA sequences of nematodes morphologically ascribable to the genus Eustrongylides allowed to identify them as E. excisus. From the five studied fish species (Perca fluviatilis, Lepomis gibbous, Coregonus lavaretus, Alosa fallax lacustris and Micropterus salmoides), only three presented the parasite E. excisus: P. fluviatilis, L. gibbous and M. salmoides, with significant differences in prevalence values among species (p = 0.002). Additionally, there were differences in prevalence values within the same fish species captured from different sampling sites. Findings showed that mainly piscivorous fish were positive for E. excisus and how the prevalence was highest in M. salmoides. As regard the fish size, a negative correlation between body size and E. excisus was found in P. fluviatilis due to the feeding habit of juvenile perch which feed mainly zooplankton and benthic invertebrates (i.e., oligochaetes, which are the first intermediate hosts of E. excisus). The study findings advance novel knowledge in the field of pathogens of zoonotic importance in the aquatic environment.					; Tedesco, Perla/AAD-8243-2022; Prearo, Marino/AAF-3369-2021; menconi, Vasco/ABH-1632-2020; Esposito, Giuseppe/HKE-1040-2023; Pastorino, Paolo/T-5288-2019; Mugetti, Davide/AAM-2277-2021; gustinelli, andrea/X-6057-2019	menconi, Vasco/0000-0003-1176-6995; Mugetti, Davide/0000-0002-4666-6823; FIORAVANTI, MARIALETIZIA/0000-0002-8234-432X; Esposito, Giuseppe/0000-0001-6665-2712; Gustinelli, Andrea/0000-0002-4249-4278; Tedesco, Perla/0000-0001-8962-9929; Prearo, Marino/0000-0002-2847-6006; Pastorino, Paolo/0000-0002-0585-1168; PIZZUL, ELISABETTA/0000-0001-9916-5005; 														2073-4441				DEC	2021	13	24							3581	10.3390/w13243581	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13243581													WOS:000778385700001

Structure and Production Potential of Summer Phytoplankton of Lake Baikal in the Present Period	WATER RESOURCES												A study of the structure and production parameters of phytoplankton (biomass, photosynthesis rate, chlorophyll a content, and assimilation numbers) in the coastal and pelagic zones of the southern and central basins of Lake Baikal in the summer period 2018 has been performed. In the rivers and estuarine areas of the lake, the maximum concentration of dissolved organic matter reached 12.95 mg L-1 and was recorded near the southwestern coast, in the pelagic zone-in the central part of Maloye More-from 2.26 to 3.18 mg L-1. At the pelagic stations, the quantitative indicators of phytopicoplankton were higher. The nanoplankton phytoflagellates, the development of which was facilitated by high concentrations of dissolved organic matter were the main producers of the coastal zone. The chlorophyll content in the phytoplankton at sampling most stations did not exceed the values revealed earlier for the summer phytoplankton of the lake (from 0.1 to 4 mu g L-1), and the average rate of photosynthesis in the surface layer of the lake was 26.3 +/- 8.7 mu g C L-1 day(-1) and exceeded the values of 18.5 +/- 5.9 mu g C L-1 day(-1) published for the summer phytoplankton of the southern and central Baikal basins developing at the same depth. High production characteristics are provided both by an additional influx of nutrients and by the vegetation of small forms of microalgae.

Variability of hydrochemical parameters of small boreal lakes under natural and anthropogenic factors (case study of NW Russia)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Small lakes of the boreal zone are highly sensitive indicators of both global environmental change and local anthropogenic pressure. This work presents the results of multidisciplinary study of three small, seasonally stratified lakes of NW Russia, conducted since 2002 to the present time. These lakes were subjected to various degree of impact by rural population and agricultural activity since the beginning of twentieth century but the population and anthropogenic pressure have decreased since 1990s. To monitor the recovering of these lakes from human impact and to relate the evolution of their hydrochemical parameters to short-term weather events and global climatic trend, we measured the lake water temperature and chemical composition (carbon, macro- and micronutrients, trace elements) in summer and winter over full depth of the water column. The pH and concentration of DIC, SO4 and H2S decreased over past decade. Concentrations of Si and nitrite increased over past 15 years, probably linked to progressive replacement of diatoms by cyanobacteria. We also recorded an increase in concentration of Cl and major cations in all lakes, likely linked to increasing connection to groundwater reservoirs. Some trace elements (Fe, Mn, Al, Zn, As, Pb) can serve as suitable indicators of on-going natural processes controlling lake response to external factors. Unlike widely reported global trend of DOC and Fe concentration increase in boreal surface waters of Europe and Northern America, such trend was not discernable in studied Fe-rich humic lakes. We conclude on the necessity of complex, multidisciplinary studies of small humic lakes in the boreal zone, because these "model" lakes can serve as important proxies of on-going environmental changes in highly abundant aquatic ecosystems of poorly characterized regions of NW Russia.					; Klimov, Sergey/B-2191-2014; Kokryatskaya, Natalia/V-4986-2017; Chupakov, Artem/A-9191-2014; Pokrovsky, Oleg/C-8078-2016; Титова, Ксения/HHZ-2774-2022; Vorobieva, Taisia/AAZ-2832-2020; Moreva, Olga/A-8591-2014; Zabelina, Svetlana/A-8851-2014	Vorob'eva, Taisia/0000-0002-3410-0240; Moreva, Ol'ga/0000-0002-5114-8481; Chupakov, Artem/0000-0001-6424-5582; , Ksenia/0000-0001-7664-7706; Zabelina, Svetlana/0000-0001-7160-0618; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				DEC	2020	847	21			SI		4653	4670		10.1007/s10750-020-04193-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-020-04193-2		FEB 2020											WOS:000515865200001

The lake snow and ice thicknesses were modelled applying a thermodynamic model, and the results were compared with observations. Regression equations were derived for the relationships between meteorological parameters and modelled snow and ice properties. The composite differences of large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns between seasons of thin and thick ice were analysed. The air temperature had an increasing trend (statistical significance p<0.05) during the freezing season (1.0 degrees C/decade), associated with an increasing trend of liquid precipitation (p<0.05) in winter. Both observed and modelled average and maximum ice thicknesses showed a decreasing trend (p<0.05). The model results were statistically more reliable (1) for lake ice than snow and (2) for seasonal means than maxima. Low temperature with less precipitation prompted the formation of columnar ice, whereas strong winds and heavy snowfall were in favour of granular ice formation. The granular (columnar) ice thickness was positively (negatively) correlated with precipitation. The seasonal mean and maximum modelled lake ice and snow thicknesses were controlled by precipitation and temperature history, with 58-86 % of the inter-annual variance explained. Using regression equations derived from data from 1980 to 2013, snow and ice thickness for the following winter seasons was statistically forecasted, yielding errors of 9-12 %. Among large-scale climate indices, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation was the only one that correlated with interannual variations in the seasonal average ice thickness in Lake Unari.

Interannual Changes in the Spring Zooplankton of the Pelagic Zone of Lake Sevan (Armenia) in the Course of Increasing Fish Biomass	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												It is shown that increasing fish biomass due to planktivorous whitefish Coregonuslavaretus L. in Lake Sevan leads to a reduction in the number of species, abundance, and biomass of spring ZP. In addition, quantitative characteristics of large species of Cladocera, Daphnia (Ctenodaphnia) magna Straus, and a decrease in the Shannon index value are changing as well. A decrease in the number of filter-feeding cladocerans contributes to a decrease in water transparency and an increase in the proportion of Rotifera in the total abundance and biomass of the community.

Middle Pleistocene climate and hydrological environment at the Boxgrove hominin site (West Sussex, UK) from ostracod records	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS					Annual Discussion Meeting of the Quaternary-Research-Association	JAN 08-10, 2008	ENGLAND	Quaternary Res Assoc				The sediments of the Slindon Formation at the junction of the Chalk South Downs and the West Sussex Coastal Plain, as revealed and studied at Boxgrove, contain evidence for early Middle Pleistocene environments in southern England around half a million years ago The archaeological importance of the deposits is attested to by the recovery of stone and organic tools, butchered fauna and fossil hominin remains. We combine palaeoecological and geochemical analyses of ostracods from the coastal plain deposits to reconstruct the climate and environment at one period of the hominin occupation The stratigraphy of our study area is indicative of a terrestrial environment surrounding a small lake or pond. Ostracod assemblages from the sediments indicate that the ponds were shallow but permanent, and fed by groundwater and springwater. However, the species alone cannot confirm that these ponds were completely fresh. Application of Mutual Climatic Range (MCR) techniques shows that summer temperatures were similar to present-day values and winter temperatures were probably colder, whereas mean annual air temperature was similar to present or perhaps slightly cooler. Trace-element and strontium-isotope analyses of ostracods from the sediments support the conclusion that the ponds were fed largely by fresh groundwater derived from the chalk, although there may have been a minor seawater input. The carbon-isotope ratios of the ostracod shells arc consistent with a groundwater source, although they also indicate that the dissolved inorganic carbon most likely did not reach equilibrium with atmospheric carbon dioxide, suggesting that the ponds had short residence time. The combination of palaeotemperature estimates with oxygen-isotope values from ostracod shells allowed us to reconstruct the oxygen-isotope ratio of the Pond water, which was close to the value of early Middle Pleistocene precipitation at this site Values were similar to present day, suggesting that there may have been a change in seasonality or precipitation source, since the mean air temperatures might have been lower.

A technique for detecting pathogens in environmental water samples has recently been developed. In the present work, the monitoring of pathogenic viruses in Lake Erhai and Lake Dianchi (Yunnan, China) was performed. Yunnan possesses a rich diversity of cyprinid fish, and the aquaculture of freshwater fish is a highly prosperous industry in this region. Thus, Cyprinid herpesvirus 1, 2, and 3 as well as three rhabdoviruses, Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus, Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, and the Spring viremia of carp virus, all of which have severe impacts on aquaculture, were targeted. Viruses in lake surface water were concentrated and then quantified/detected by real-time PCR/real-time reverse transcription PCR. Five of the six tested viruses were detected in lake water. Although there has been no reported viral outbreak in the survey lakes, our results indicate a potential risk for these viral diseases.

The lake has gone through several changes in its state which are well represented in its sediments: section 1 (4.52-4.97 m) represents the subbase; section 2 (3.0-4.57 m) corresponds to a "shallow lake" stage and contains two sublayers; section 3 (0-2.25 m) illustrates an increase in erosion of the shoreline and corresponds to a "deep lake" stage. The extrapolation of radiocarbon dates suggests that the most significant changes in the state of the lake occurred at about 6.5-7.1 ka BP (transition from a small lake to a large one with intensified coastal erosion) and at about 5.69 and 3.5 ka BP (increase in the organic component). The results of sequential extraction of elements correspond to chemical changes occurred in a certain time of the lake state by changing in their distribution level and fraction type along the core. The results of lake water evaporation and organic matter degradation modelling performed in Phreeqc for oxic and anoxic condition showed the following stages of chemical divides could be expected in case of further lakes desiccation: Halite-Epsomite-Bischofite/Carnalite with possibility of Nahcolite precipitation in carbonate enriched periods (summer and autumn periods of organic matter degradation). Water-rock interaction processes in combination with biogeochemical reactions affect drastically not only the migration features of elements in water and sediments, but also the type of mineral crystallization in lake sediments.

Consequently, the Dutch Flow Model (DUFLOW) based water quality model "Spreewald" and results from the emission model "Modelling Nutrient Emissions in River Systems" (MONERIS) were used to estimate to which extent wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) could contribute to the NO3- concentration in surface waters if they were operated without denitrification. It is demonstrated that an effective phosphorus retention in sediments by means of surface water NO3- is possible only under specific conditions, i.e. (i) a sufficient supply of surface water to the sediment by advective fluxes, (ii) a sufficient amount of sediment iron to provide phosphorus binding sites in the case of sediment oxidation, (iii) a redox system not leading to a rapid NO3- and FeOOH depletion and to phosphorus release from organic pools by high microbial activities. Model results show that in-stream denitrification processes counteract a significant increase of NO3- surface water concentrations from WWTPs operated without denitrification during summer, when eutrophication risk through phosphorus is highest. The increase of NO3- surface water concentrations in winter due to decreased denitrification in the surface water is of minor relevance for phosphorus release from sediments.					; Schilling, Christian/AFK-2026-2022	Zessner, Matthias/0000-0003-1231-4253; 													0323-4320					AUG	2006	34	4					333	345		10.1002/aheh.200500633	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aheh.200500633													WOS:000240038700004

Stratospheric warming and long-term blocking processes in troposphere over Europe and Yakutia preceded the development of deep high-latitude cyclones over Siberia and the Urals. High-latitude convergence over Siberia was accompanied by a strong cyclonic wind shift and intensification of jet stream. On the whole, weakening of western transfer within the significant layer of atmosphere, decrease of a number of deep cyclones in the Western Arctic, as well as stratospheric warming create a high level of predictability of short-period climatic changes over Siberia in winter.

J	PITLICK, J				PITLICK, J			RESPONSE AND RECOVERY OF A SUB-ALPINE STREAM FOLLOWING A CATASTROPHIC FLOOD	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												The July 15, 1982, Lawn Lake flood in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, was caused by the failure of a 79-yr-old earthen dam. Peak discharges of the flood far exceeded naturally occurring flows, and it caused severe channel disturbance along most of Roaring River and some parts of Fall River. This study documents the geomorphic response of a 5-km reach of Fall River in the 5 yr following the flood. In 1983, the first year after the Lawn Lake flood, snowmelt flows were well above average. These high flows together with very high sediment yields from Roaring River resulted in significant geomorphic changes on reaches of Fall River downstream. During the 1983 snowmelt runoff, approximately 15.5 X 10(6) kg of bed-load sediment was eroded from the upper part of the study area. These loads were at least 1,000 times higher than before the Lawn Lake flood. Most of this sediment was then deposited in a highly sinuous reach of Fall River in the lower part of the study area. This reach had not been much affected by the Lawn Lake flood, but sedimentation during the period of high flow in 1983 completely filled in the channel, resulting in the formation of a continuous 2.3-km-long depositional zone. In 1984, sediment yield from Roaring River declined dramatically, and this trend continued for the next 3 yr. By 1987, the bed-load sediment yield in the upper reaches of Fall River was only about 0.4 X 10(6) kg/yr. The decline in sediment loads resulted in progressive erosion and recovery of the original channel of Fall River in the depositional zone reach. Recovery in the upstream part of the depositional zone was complete by 1985. Recovery in the downstream part of the depositional zone took longer because of the continued supply of sediment and because the sediment was mobile less of the time. As of 1987, about 80% of the material initially stored in the sedimentation zone had been eroded. Bed-load sediment yields at a sampling site 1 km downstream of the terminus of the depositional zone ranged from 5 X 10(6) to 11 X 10(6) kg/yr, but showed no significant decline over the 5-yr study period. The average rate of bed-load transport through this reach was at least 100 times greater than before the Lawn Lake flood, but few discernible channel changes resulted from the higher loads.																			0016-7606					MAY	1993	105	5					657	670		10.1130/0016-7606(1993)105<0657:RAROAS>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0016-7606(1993)105<0657:RAROAS>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1993LB11100006

Here, a ubiquitous hydrophyte in southern China (Alternanthera philoxeroides, A. philoxeroides) was selected to identify the processes and mechanisms of sedimentary P release in late autumn or early spring by laboratory incubation. The results showed that the physio-chemical interactions changed quickly during the beginning of the incubation, where the redox potential and dissolved oxygen at the water-sediment interface decreased rapidly, reaching reducing (299 mV) and anoxic (0.23 mg center dot L-1) conditions, respectively. Soluble reactive P, dissolved total P and total P concentrations in overlying water all increased with time from 0.011, 0.025 and 0.169 mg center dot L-1 to 0.100, 0.100 and 0.342 mg center dot L-1 on average, respectively. Furthermore, the decomposition of A. philoxeroides induced sedimentary organic P release to overlying water, including phosphate monoester (Mono-P), and orthophosphate diesters (Diesters-P). The proportions of Mono-P and Diesters-P were higher at 3 to 9 days than at 11 to 34 days, being 29.4% and 23.3 for Mono-P, 6.3% and 5.7% for Diesters-P, respectively. Orthophosphate (Ortho-P) increased from 63.6 to 69.7% during these timeframes, which indicated the transformations of both Mono-P and Diester-P to bio-available orthophosphate (Ortho-P), causing the rising P concentration in the overlying water. Our results revealed that hydrophyte debris decomposition in river systems might lead to autochthonous P contribution even without external P import from the watershed, accelerating the trophic state of receiving waterbodies.																			0007-4861	1432-0800				JUN	2023	110	6							103	10.1007/s00128-023-03744-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-023-03744-2								37284960					WOS:001002998300003
J	Byrne, M				Byrne, M			Reproduction of river and lake populations of Hyridella depressa (Unionacea: Hyriidae) in New South Wales:: implications for their conservation	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The freshwater mussel Hyridella depressa is an important component of the macrobiota of freshwater systems of south-eastern Australia. This species has declined in river habitats but is abundant in impounded water storages. Reproduction of river and lake populations of H. depressa was investigated to document details of their gametogenic cycle and to determine when the females incubate embryos in their gill marsupia. Four populations in Lake Burragorang and two populations in the Hawkesbury-Nepean River were studied over two breeding seasons. Reproduction was documented by anatomical and histological examination of the gonads. The study sites differed in anthropogenic influence and trophic status and the influence of these factors on reproduction in H. depressa was assessed. A skewed sex ratio in favour of females was common in the populations and histology revealed that some of these females were microhermaphrodites. It appears that sexuality in H. depressa is labile with the potential for self-fertilisation by individuals that largely function as females. H. depressa is a long-term brooder with progeny present in the marsupia for up to eight months of the year from mid-winter to late summer. Across all sites brooding started in July or August and finished in January or February of the following year. In parallel with the prolonged spawning pattern, gametogenesis in H. depressa was continuous. At the eutrophic sites the gonads contained advanced gametes throughout the year. H. depressa at these sites had a high annual reproductive output with the females producing several clutches each year. In contrast, gametogenesis in mussels at the oligotrophic sites was more seasonal. At one of the oligotrophic sites reproductive failure was common and in 1996 most females failed to brood a single clutch. Implications of this research for conservation of H. depressa are discussed.

J	Tang, PP; Chen, FL; Zhu, XK; Zhou, W				Tang, Panpan; Chen, Fulong; Zhu, Xiaokun; Zhou, Wei			Monitoring Cultural Heritage Sites with Advanced Multi-Temporal InSAR Technique: The Case Study of the Summer Palace	REMOTE SENSING												Cultural heritage sites are rare and irreplaceable wealth of human civilization. The majority of them are becoming unstable due to a combination of human and natural disturbances. High-precision, efficient deformation monitoring facilitates the early recognition of potential risks and enables preventive diagnosis of heritage sites. In this study, an advanced Multi-Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MTInSAR) approach was developed by jointly analyzing Persistent Scatterers (PSs) and Distributed Scatterers (DSs) using high-resolution SAR images. Taking the World Heritage Site of Summer Palace in Beijing as the experimental site, deformation resulting from PSs/DSs showed that overall the site was generally stable except for specific areas and/or monuments. Urbanization (construction and demolition) triggered new subsidence in the vicinity of East and South Gate of the site. Slight to moderate (mm/cm-level) instabilities of ruins and monuments on Longevity Hill were detected, perhaps due to a combination of destructive anthropogenic activities and long-term natural decay. Subsidence was also detected along the Kunming Lakeside and was probably attributable to variation of the groundwater level, excessive visitor numbers as well as lack of maintenance. This study presents the potential of the MTInSAR approach for the monitoring and conservation of cultural heritage sites.

J	Stapanian, MA; Waite, TA				Stapanian, MA; Waite, TA			Species density of waterbirds in offshore habitats in western Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												Offshore censuses of birds are lacking for inland seas, such as the Laurentian Great Lakes, but may provide valuable information for managing species that are in conflict with human interests. Birds were counted along 31 established transects in four habitats in western Lake Erie: offshore of waterbird refuges, offshore of beaches with human development, on reefs and shoals, and in open water. A total of 161 10-min counts were conducted between 24 April and I September 2000. The mean number of aquatic bird species/km(2) (species density) was greater offshore of refuges than on open water. For all habitats combined, species density increased over time. This was mainly due to the arrival of Bonaparte's Gulls (Larus philadelphia) and Great Black-backed Gulls (L. marinus), two fall and winter residents that do not breed in the study area, and increased use of open water and reefs and shoals by Herring Gulls (L. argentatus) and Ring-billed Gulls (L. delawarensis) after the nesting season. Species density was not strongly spatially autocorrelated, either for all species or for only those species that were floating on the water when recorded. Neither Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) nor Herring Gulls exhibited spatial autocorrelation. In contrast, Bonaparte's and Ring-billed gulls exhibited positive spatial autocorrelations. Unlike marine studies, species density was only weakly associated with water depth. This result was due mainly to Double-crested Cormorants, the only diving bird species that lived year-round in the area, which preferred reefs and shoals (depth 3-6 m) over open water ( greater than or equal to10 m). The results suggest that offshore habitat influences species density in this area during the breeding and immediate post-breeding seasons.

Spatial and temporal variability of contaminants of emerging concern in a drinking water source	RSC ADVANCES												The spatial-temporal behaviour of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) are not well-documented in drinking water sources, including in Quebec, Canada. In this study, a set of seven contaminants, which are more frequently reported in water sources, were monitored from May 2016 to August 2017 at ten locations within an urbanized watershed (lakes and rivers) in Quebec, Canada. Samples were collected between a wastewater plant discharge (upstream) and the intake of a drinking water plant (downstream). The results showed that three (acetaminophen, salicylic acid, caffeine) out of seven CECs were consistently detected at a range of up to a few hundred ng L-1 at all sampling stations throughout the sampling period with a detection frequency between 51% and 94%. Upstream of two wastewater plant discharge locations, six CECs were measured above the detection limit compared to other locations where only three CECs (acetaminophen, salicylic acid, caffeine) were detected. Most of the CEC concentrations were higher (a few ng L-1) during late winter in comparison with the summer, in both years 2016 and 2017. The results highlight that the wastewater effluents and septic system effluents are significant sources of CECs that are released into the surface water. Moreover, the results help to identify the spatio-temporal patterns, which is a crucial element to understand the fate of CECs in water sources submitted to extreme weather conditions during the year. This research also provides baseline data for CEC occurrence at different points across lakes, rivers, and tributaries which will be useful for future ecotoxicological studies.					; Pulicharla, Rama/AAY-3237-2021; Rodriguez, Manuel/P-3713-2015	Rodriguez, Manuel J/0000-0003-2010-6438; 														2046-2069				JUL 14	2022	12	32					20876	20885		10.1039/d2ra02962f	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ra02962f								35919150					WOS:000829708100001

Major food items of the catfish comprised undigested important fisheries species, such as Hypomesus nipponensis, Salangichthys microdon, Gymnogobius urotaenia and Macrobrachium nipponense, frequently occurring also in the fyke-net catches. Mean stomach fullness index in each size class larger than 20 cm SL was extremely high (6.7.8.8) compared to those in the natural environment. It is therefore highly possible that individuals larger than 20 cm SL ate small fishes and shrimp in the fyke-net. The estimated proportion of predation on each species by the catfish in the fyke-net throughout the study period was 73.7., 80.1., 36.6. and 33.3. for H. nipponensis, S. microdon, G. urotaenia and M. nipponense entering the net, respectively. Thus, predation by the cat fish on important fisheries species inside the fyke-net was considered to be a major problem in local lake fisheries.																			0021-5392	1349-998X					2021	87	6					652	661		10.2331/suisan.21-00010	http://dx.doi.org/10.2331/suisan.21-00010													WOS:000720206300006

These two varieties used in the experience have been distinguished by both vegetation period (125 days and May King and 85 days at Great Lakes 118), as well as by specific reaction to the treatments application. Plant growth was influenced differently by the two foliar fertilizers, the biggest differences from the control was on V3 (Agriphyte) for the variety May King and on V2 (Folimax) for Great Lakes 118. Plant height has increased on average by 1-1.5 cm; diameter rosette of leaves has reached 32 cm, respectively 28 cm; average weight of the lettuce head has exceeded the control with 17% for variety May King and with 4% for Great Lakes 118. Concerning the production of lettuce (t/ha) the influence of experimental treatments was similar to that observed on plant growth. From the control, the greatest differences in production were obtained in variant treated with Agriphyte (17.5 %) for the variety May King and to the fertilizer with Folimax, in the case of the variety Great Lakes 118 (4 %). The smallest production differences for both varieties was registered at V4 (P&R). The results show that for the variety May King the yield was 24 t/ha (V1 control) to 28 t/ha (V3 Agriphyte. Variety Great Lakes 118, gives yield average by 26 t/ha (Vlcontrol) to 27 t/ha (V2 Folimax).																			2285-5653	2286-1580					2012	56						225	231																WOS:000450194200039

In the proposed methodology, daily normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series data with 30 m resolution were first generated based on the constructed pixel-by-pixel downscaling models between the simultaneously acquired MODIS-NDVI and Landsat-NDVI data. In the compositing process, a Minimum Value Composite (MinVC) algorithm was used to generate monthly minimum NDVI time series, which were then segmented into a seamless SWE time series of the years 2000-2020 with 30 m resolution from the cloud background. A comparison with the existing Landsat-derived JRC (European Joint Research Centre) monthly surface water products and altimetry-derived water level series revealed that the proposed methodology effectively provides reliable descriptions of spatio-temporal SWE dynamics. Over Lake Victoria, the average percentage of valid observations made using the JRC's products was only about 70% due to persistent cloud cover or linear strips, and the correlation with the water level series was poor (R-2 = 0.13). In contrast, our derived results strongly correlated with the water level series (R-2 = 0.54) and efficiently outperformed the JRC's surface water products in terms of both space and time. Using the derived SWE data, the long-term and seasonal characteristics of lake area dynamics were studied. During the past 20 years, a significant changing pattern of an initial decline followed by an increase was found for the annual mean SWE, with the lowest area of 66,386.57 km(2) in 2006. A general seasonal variation in the monthly mean lake area was also observed, with the largest SWE obtained during June-August and the smallest SWE observed during September-November. Particularly in the spring of 2006 and the autumn of 2020, Lake Victoria experienced intense episodes of drought and flooding, respectively. These results demonstrate that our proposed methodology is more robust with respect to capturing spatially and temporally continuous SWE data in cloudy conditions, which could also be further extended to other regions for the optimal management of water resources.					; Fan, Xingwang/H-6348-2019	Fan, Xingwang/0000-0003-0099-1839; LIU, Yuanbo/0000-0002-8780-927X														2072-4292				JUL	2023	15	14							3500	10.3390/rs15143500	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15143500													WOS:001037581600001
J	Pan, H; Avissar, R; Haidvogel, DB				Pan, H; Avissar, R; Haidvogel, DB			Summer circulation and temperature structure of Lake Kinneret	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY												A three-dimensional lake model driven by wind stress and heat flux fields derived from an atmospheric model is applied to Lake Kinneret, Israel. The summer wind field over the lake has a strong diurnal and large spatial variation due to complex terrain surrounding the lake, the sharp temperature contrast between the arid land and the lake, and due to the penetration of the Mediterranean sea breeze (MSB) into the lake area. The daily mean wind curl field, which is predominantly determined by the penetration of the MSB, is responsible for the generation of three lake gyres. One of them dominates most of the lake and rotates counterclockwise. It is flanked to the north and to the south by two smaller ones that rotate clockwise. During the summer, the diurnal variation of the wind over the lake is repeated daily due to consistent forcing conditions during that season. Numerical tests show that the rectified flow induced by the diurnal winds plays a minor role in the lake circulation. The thermocline oscillation, which was believed to be the free propagation of internal Kelvin waves, mainly responds to the surface elevation set up by the time-dependent winds, and it appears that no systematic counterclockwise propagating waves with large thermocline displacements exist in the lake. The intense MSB over the lake in the late afternoon pushes the heated surface water toward the east, forcing the deep cooler water to be advected westward, and creating strong mixing over the shallow western shore. This results in higher temperature off the eastern shore and lower temperature off the western shore. However, a strong mean flow is constantly eliminating the temperature difference by counterclockwise transfer of the western cooler water eastward. The results are in good agreement with available observations.																			0022-3670	1520-0485					2002	32	1					295	313		10.1175/1520-0485(2002)032<0295:SCATSO>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0485(2002)032<0295:SCATSO>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000173257700016

This study aims to identify an accurate means to estimate reservoir evaporation with simple meteorological inputs during the open-water season, using long-term eddy covariance observations from two boreal hydropower reservoirs with contrasting morphometry as reference. Unlike the temperate water bodies on which the majority of other studies have focused, northern reservoirs are governed by three distinct periods: ice cover in the cold season, warming in the summer and energy release in the fall. The reservoirs of interest are Eastmain-1 (52 degrees N, mean depth of 11 m) and Romaine-2 (51 degrees N, mean depth of 42 m), both located in eastern Canada. Four approaches are analysed herein: a combination approach, a radiation-based approach, a mass-transfer approach, and empirical methods. Of all the approaches, the bulk transfer equation with a constant Dalton number of 1.2 x 10(-3) gave the most accurate estimation of evaporation at hourly time steps, compared with the eddy covariance observations (RMSE of 0.06 mm h(-1) at Eastmain-1 and RMSE of 0.04 mm h(-1) at Romaine-2). The daily series also showed good accuracy (RMSE of 1.38 mm day(-1) at Eastmain-1 and RMSE of 0.62 mm day(-1) at Romaine-2) both in the warming and energy release phases of the open-water season. The bulk transfer equation, on the other hand, was incapable of reproducing condensation episodes that occurred soon after ice breakup. Basic and variance-based sensitivity analyses were conducted, in particular to measure the variation in performance when the bulk transfer equation was applied with meteorological observations collected at a certain distance (similar to 10-30 km) from the reservoir. This exercise illustrated that accurate estimates of open water evaporation require representative measurements of wind speed and water surface temperature.

Ecological effects of multiple stressors on a deep lake (Lago Maggiore, Italy) integrating neo and palaeolimnological approaches	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												To understand interactions of lake physical characteristics, trophic dynamics and climate in Logo Maggiore, we compare long-term limnological and meteorological monitoring data and results from sediment cores. We include analyses of nutrients, pigments, diatoms and cladoceran microfossils. Over the past decades, caloric content increased. Eutrophication from the 1960s to early 1980s was followed by oligotrophication. DDTs, PCBs and Hg showed high contamination in the '60s, compared to point source inputs in the '90s. Algal biomass was predicted by total pigments and some algal specific carotenoids Following nutrient enrichment, Chydorus sphaericus, and total abundance of cladocerans changed inversely with trophic status. Fewer large Daphnia since the late '80s matched on increase in with subfossil Eubosmina mucro lengths. Both were explained by the 10-fold increase in Bythotrephes longimanus from 1987 to 1993, when an increase of its mean annual population density occurred during warmer winter and springs. Bythotrephes remained abundant and fort her increased during the following 10 years as water temperature increased. We conclude that warmer water affects food chains indirectly by changing habitat use and predator-prey interactions. Relative abundances of Daphnia and its peak population density in the warm year of the oligotrophic period (2003) were close to the record from the mesotrophic period in 1982, supporting the hypothesis that warming can produce a eutrophication-like signal. The study illustrates the complexity of biological responses to synchronous changes in multiple drivers (e.g., eutrophication, fish introduction, ban of fish harvesting, chemical pollution, and climate) and, despite this complexity, how Logo Maggiore responded to multiple stressors.

Vanishing river ice cover in the lower part of the Danube basin - signs of a changing climate	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Many of the world's largest rivers in the extra tropics are covered with ice during the cold season, and in the Northern Hemisphere approximately 60% of the rivers experience significant seasonal effects of river ice. Here we present an observational data set of the ice cover regime for the lower part of the Danube River which spans over the period 1837-2016, and its the longest one on record over this area. The results in this study emphasize the strong impact of climate change on the occurrence of ice regime especially in the second part of the 20th century. The number of ice cover days has decreased considerably (-28days/century) mainly due to an increase in the winter mean temperature. In a long-term context, based on documentary evidences, we show that the ice cover occurrence rate was relatively small throughout the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), while the highest occurrence rates were found during the Maunder Minimum and Dalton Minimum periods. We conclude that the river ice regime can be used as a proxy for the winter temperature over the analyzed region and as an indicator of climate-change related impacts.

Microblade technology and the rise of serial specialists in north-central China	JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL ARCHAEOLOGY												Though present before the Last Glacial Maximum, microblade technology is uncommon in the lithic assemblages of north-central China until the onset of the Younger Dryas (12,900-11,600 calBP). While it is clear that microblades here and elsewhere were connected with mobile adaptations organized around hunting, the attendant assumption that they served primarily in hunting weaponry is not. The archaeological record of north-central China, including excavations at Pigeon Mountain (QG3) and Shuidonggou Locality 12 (SDG 12) in Ningxia Autonomous Region, and Dadiwan in Gansu Providence, and a handful of bone/antler tools slotted for microblade inserts, indicate a more direct linkage to mobility. These data suggest the rise of microblade technology in Younger Diyas north-central China was mainly the result of microblades used as insets in composite knives needed for production of sophisticated cold weather clothing needed for a winter mobile hunting adaptation akin to the residentially mobile pattern Binford termed "serial specialist."

This study aimed to determine whether repeated cold-water exposure leads to the up-regulation of antioxidant defenses and whether or not this leads to a reduction in basal and/or acute pulses of oxidative distress in humans. The study group consisted of 28 healthy male members of the WS club (average age 39.3 +/- 6.1 years). The study sessions occurred at the beginning and the end of the WS season. During the WS season, the participants took 3-min cold-water baths in a cold lake once a week. Blood samples were collected three times during each session: before the bath, 30 min after the bath, and 24 h after the bath. The activity of selected antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), as well as the concentration of lipid peroxidation (LPO) products, including thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and conjugated dienes (CD), were determined in erythrocytes. The concentration of TBARS, CD, retinol, and alpha-tocopherol were determined in the blood plasma, whereas the level of other LPO products, including 4-hydroxynonenal and 8-iso-prostaglandin F2 alpha, were determined in the blood serum. The repeated cold exposure up-regulated most antioxidant defenses, and this led to an attenuation of most indicators of oxidative stress at the baseline and acute pulses in response to cold exposure. In conclusion, due to regular cold exposure, the antioxidant barrier of winter swimmers was stimulated. Thus, short cold-bath sessions seem to be an effective intervention, inducing promoting positive adaptive changes such as the increased antioxidant capacity of the organism.					; Sutkowy, Pawel/G-9282-2014; Wesolowski, Roland/F-4134-2014; Szewczyk-Golec, Karolina/E-9110-2014; Wozniak, Alina/H-4699-2014; Woźniak, Alina/H-4699-2014; Mila-Kierzenkowska, Celestyna/F-1858-2014; Pawłowska, Marta/Q-8361-2019; Sutkowy, Paweł/G-9282-2014	Saletnik, Lukasz/0000-0001-7847-4351; Pawlowska, Marta/0000-0003-1640-9196; Sutkowy, Pawel/0000-0002-3479-7738; Wesolowski, Roland/0000-0003-2673-8313; Szewczyk-Golec, Karolina/0000-0001-8123-3882; Wozniak, Alina/0000-0002-4492-4796; 														2218-1989				FEB	2023	13	2							143	10.3390/metabo13020143	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/metabo13020143								36837762					WOS:000940026100001

Impacts of freshwater aquaculture on fish communities: A whole-ecosystem experimental approach	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Aquaculture is a growing global industry; freshwater aquaculture has significant potential for expansion in Canada, but growth of the freshwater sector has been slow due to concerns over potential environmental impacts and a lack of information on potential impacts to native fish communities. To provide guidelines and target variables for evaluating aquaculture impacts on freshwater fish communities, we operated an experimental aquaculture farm as a whole-lake experiment where 10,000 rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were raised annually from 2003 to 2007. Impacts were assessed using up to 8years of pre-impact and 8-10years of post-impact data. Prey fish abundance increased dramatically during aquaculture but declined sharply following the experiment. High abundance of littoral minnows in autumn was not observed during spring and, combined with size distribution data, suggests high overwinter mortality of adult minnows. White sucker (Catostomus commersonii) abundance and body condition declined during and after aquaculture, with evidence of overwinter juvenile recruitment failure in the last 2 years of operation, although size-at-age increased. The adult abundance of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) doubled during aquaculture, due to a combination of (a) increased growth rates of young trout and (b) earlier age and larger sizes at maturation. Within 2years following aquaculture, lake trout abundance declined by nearly 50% to background levels, suggesting a large increase in lake trout mortality once operations ceased. These changes were not observed in nearby reference lakes. While aquaculture appeared to benefit some species (slimy sculpin [Cottus cognatus], minnows, lake trout), prolonged declines in white sucker abundance and condition and continued depression of Mysis densities and optimal oxythermal habitat availability nearly a decade following operations suggest potentially long-term impacts at this magnitude. Importantly, this experiment highlights important indicator species and life history traits for monitoring of freshwater aquaculture impacts on native fish communities.

AQUATIC SCIENCES												Road salt (NaCl) is commonly used as a deicer during winter to improve road safety, resulting in freshwater salinization. Such elevated chloride concentrations may have a strong effect on zooplankton, which are key elements in freshwater food webs. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of chloride ion concentration and inter-pond environmental variability on zooplankton density in four urban ponds over 3 years differing in winter conditions. Analysis of variance showed significant differences in chloride ion concentration and zooplankton density regarding study year and ponds. Redundancy analysis of column water data showed that both the environmental variables (including chloride ion concentration) and the pond location significantly contributed to the model explaining the variability in zooplankton densities. However, the environment variable (referring to the environmental variables) had a smaller contribution (11%) than the POND variable (related to the spatial configuration of the ponds), which contributed 62%, indicating that the dynamics of zooplankton density depended primarily on ecosystem characteristics. Even so, although chloride content was not the main determinant of zooplankton density, their presence in aquatic ecosystems and potential interactions with other types of pollutants could have negative biological and ecological effects.					; Szklarek, Sebastian/AAC-1776-2022; Kukuła, Krzysztof/IVH-4929-2023	Wojtal-Frankiewicz, Adrianna/0000-0003-3509-6076; Kukula, Krzysztof/0000-0002-9685-7994; Szklarek, Sebastian/0000-0003-1363-4806; Frankiewicz, Piotr/0000-0003-1782-9539; Gorecka, Aleksandra/0000-0002-7573-2180													1015-1621	1420-9055				OCT	2023	85	4							111	10.1007/s00027-023-01009-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-023-01009-y													WOS:001081519600001

Saugeye were stocked into 336-ha Richmond Lake, South Dakota, an impoundment that contained an overabundant black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus) population. Small fingerling (circa 3-4 cm) stockings in 1992 and 1993 had relatively low survival; fall electrofishing catch per unit effort (CPUE) values for age-0 saugeye were 5/hr and 3/hr. In 1994 and 1995, larger (circa 14-19 cm) fingerlings were stocked, and fall CPUE values were 185/hr and 33/hr. In addition, the fingerlings stocked in 1994 were collected during fall 1995 electrofishing as age-1 fish at a rate of 41/hr. At northern latitudes, small fingerling saugeye grow slowly and likely remain vulnerable to predation by and competition with overabundant black crappie populations. Stocking larger saugeye fingerlings may overcome this problem.

J	Gerdeaux, D; Perga, ME				Gerdeaux, Daniel; Perga, Marie-Elodie			Changes in whitefish scales δ13C during eutrophication and reoligotrophication of subalpine lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We measured the isotope composition of whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) scales from 50-yr collections to determine the pattern of change of delta C-13 during the eutrophication and reoligotrophication of two subalpine lakes: Lakes Constance and Geneva. The isotope composition of scales from Lake Annecy, a subalpine lake that has been protected from eutrophication, was also determined, to provide a control value for modifications in the values of whitefish scale delta C-13 in the absence of any significant changes in the trophic status of the lake. In Lakes Constance and Geneva, changes in whitefish scales delta C-13 were closely correlated with those in the mean annual phosphorus concentrations and, to a lesser extent, also reflected the efficiency of winter mixing in Lake Geneva. In contrast, in Lake Annecy, whitefish 313 C exhibited only minor changes during the survey. Changes in whitefish scale delta C-13 with the trophic status of Lakes Geneva and Constance were not linked to either a shift in whitefish feeding behavior or to alterations in the length of the pelagic trophic chain. Hence, the pattern of variation of whitefish delta C-13 during the last decades mirrored the lakes' trophic history. The responses of the Lakes Geneva and Constance to changes in P-tot were strictly synchronous and parallel, with a response during restoration that may have been the result of the antagonism between the effects of the falling phosphorus concentration and increasing temperature.

Thermal regimes of Rocky Mountain lakes warm with climate change	PLOS ONE												Anthropogenic climate change is causing a wide range of stresses in aquatic ecosystems, primarily through warming thermal conditions. Lakes, in response to these changes, are experiencing increases in both summer temperatures and ice-free days. We used continuous records of lake surface temperature and air temperature to create statistical models of daily mean lake surface temperature to assess thermal changes in mountain lakes. These models were combined with downscaled climate projections to predict future thermal conditions for 27 high-elevation lakes in the southern Rocky Mountains. The models predict a 0.25 degrees C.decade(-1) increase in mean annual lake surface temperature through the 2080s, which is greater than warming rates of streams in this region. Most striking is that on average, ice-free days are predicted to increase by 5.9 days.decade(-1), and summer mean lake surface temperature is predicted to increase by 0.47 degrees C.decade(-1). Both could profoundly alter the length of the growing season and potentially change the structure and function of mountain lake ecosystems. These results highlight the changes expected of mountain lakes and stress the importance of incorporating climate- related adaptive strategies in the development of resource management plans.

The cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii is facilitated by copepod selective grazing	HARMFUL ALGAE												Blooms of the toxin-producing cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii occur in tropical and subtropical lakes during spring-summer but the mechanisms behind bloom formation are unclear. This study tests the hypothesis that C raciborskii accumulations in freshwater systems are facilitated by selective copepod grazing. Prey selection was examined in a series of experiments with C raciborskii and the green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, as well as within natural phytoplankton assemblages. Clearance rates of the copepod Boeckella sp. on a C raciborskii diet were 2-4 times lower than that of a common cladoceran Ceriodaphnia sp. when both grazers had prey choice. More C raciborskii was cleared by Boeckella sp. when in mixed natural phytoplankton assemblages, but the clearance rate declined when nutrient replete C reinhardtii was added, demonstrating that when alternate "high quality" algae were present, so did C raciborskii consumption. The clearance rates of Boeckella sp. on two toxic C raciborskii strains were significantly lower than on a non-toxic strain, and on C raciborskii with low cellular P content. When we tested the grazing preference of a copepod dominated mixed zooplankton community on C raciborskii during the early bloom period, clearance rates were relatively low (0.05-0.20 ml individual(-1) h(-1)), and decreased significantly as the proportion of C raciborskii increased above 5%. These results suggest that C raciborskii persistence could be promoted by copepods preferentially grazing on other algae, with significant loss of top-down control as C raciborskii abundance increases.

J	Sammons, SM; Maceina, MJ; Partridge, DG				Sammons, SM; Maceina, MJ; Partridge, DG			Population characteristics of largemouth bass associated with changes in abundance of submersed aquatic vegetation in Lake Seminole, Georgia	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												Population characteristics of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides L.) including growth, body condition (relative weight), survival, and egg production were examined in relation to abundance of submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) coverage (primarily hydrilla [Hydrilla verticillata L.f. Royle]) in three embayments of Lake Seminole, GA, and compared to a previous study conducted in 1998. Hydrilla in the Spring Creek arm was reduced by a drip-delivery fluridone (1-methyl- 3-phenyl-5-[3-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]-4(1H)-pyridinone) system beginning in May 2000; total SAV coverage declined from 76% to 22% between 2000 and 2001. In contrast, SAV in the Flint River arm increased slightly from 1997 to 2000 (32% to 40%) then declined again in 2001 (28%). Plant coverage in the Chattahoochee River arm remained similar between 1997 and 2000 (26%) and declined in 2001 (15%). Following hydrilla reduction in Spring Creek, relative weight increased 3% to 7% between 1998 and 2003 for two of four length groups of largemouth bass. In the other two reservoir arms relative weight either declined or remained the same between the time periods. Growth of age 1-3 largemouth bass was higher in Spring Creek than in the other embayments and time to reach 305 mm and 406 mm decreased by 17% and 33%, respectively, between 1998 and 2003. Time to reach 305 mm and 406 mm remained similar between 1998 and 2003 in the Chattahoochee River arm but declined by 19% and 11%, respectively, in the Flint River arm. Mean annual survival of largemouth bass declined 21% to 23% in all three reservoir arms of Lake Seminole between 1998 and 2003. With faster growth, egg production of largemouth bass doubled in Spring Creek after the SAV reduction; whereas, egg production increased 65% between 1998 and 2003 in the Chattahoochee River and increased only 33% in the Flint River, which was lowest among embayments in 2003. The large reduction of hydrilla in Spring Creek was associated with faster growth, higher relative weights, greater egg production, and lower survival for largemouth bass. However, survival declined throughout Lake Seminole; thus, reduced survival in Spring Creek was likely not related to the fluridone treatment. Abundance of SAV continues to be a strong structuring factor influencing largemouth bass population characteristics in Lake Seminole. Our study demonstrated initial benefits in growth and condition of largemouth bass can result from large-scale removal of SAV in heavily vegetated reservoir systems.

An in situ investigation, using artificial substrata, was started after extremely high spring flooding and was carried out during long-lasting summer floods (July August 2010). The physical and chemical environment was variable and large stands of metaphyton, submersed and floating macrophytes were spread along the lake. The periphyton development was initiated on the first day of exposition and algal abundance increased exponentially till day 27. Directional changes in the relative abundance of algal species, shown by the results of the non-metric multidimensional scaling, indicate a pattern of short-term sequences in algal colonization. The initial attachment of planktonic cyanobacteria and unicellular diatoms (initial phase, days 1-3) to the biofilm matrix was followed by the development of the filamentous chlorophytes, Cladophora glomerata and Oedogonium spp. (intermediate phase, days 6-15) and then by stalk-forming diatoms particularly Gomphonema spp. (late phase, days 18-33). According to the redundancy analyses, water temperature and oscillations of Danube water level that define the flooding pattern had the most significant influence on algal colonization. Flood-induced spreading of metaphyton firstly supported the rapid progress of algal colonization towards a climax community, while later, metaphyton together with macrophytes disrupted algal community by increasing the mechanical injuries, shading and grazing pressure. Consequently, algal abundance and community structure were returned to the intermediate phase of colonization.

Oxygen isotope analysis of multiple, single ostracod valves as a proxy for combined variability in seasonal temperature and lake water oxygen isotopes	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Paleoclimate studies in lakes typically use oxygen isotopic ratios in samples that consist of multiple ostracod specimens, to obtain an average delta O-18 value that reflects the mean temperature and delta O-18 of lake water over the life spans of the combined individuals measured. This approach overlooks potential information on seasonal climate variability that is recorded in the single valves of short-lived ostracods. Here we estimate seasonal variability in ostracod delta O-18 by measuring 10-30 individual carapaces of Cyprideis torosa in selected stratigraphic levels of a sediment core from paleolake Riwasa in Haryana, India. The mean delta O-18 values of ostracod populations show a general decrease from 9.6 to 8.3 kyr BP, which was interpreted previously as resulting from strengthening of the Indian summer monsoon during the early Holocene. The delta O-18 measurements of single ostracods within samples show a large range (up to 15 aEuro degrees) and standard deviation (up to +/- 3.3), suggesting high seasonal variability in the hydrology of this playa lake. The great variability is ascribed to changes in both seasonal temperature (16 A degrees C) and delta O-18 of lake water in a drying water body. The latter is attributable to the Rayleigh distillation process, described using a Craig-Gordon model for isotopic fractionation during evaporation from an open water body. Our results suggest that the range of delta O-18 values measured in single ostracod carapaces is useful to evaluate seasonal changes in lake temperature and hydrology. Even with great intra-sample delta O-18 variability, however, the mean delta O-18 of multiple (more than 10) ostracods can be used to infer long-term climate trends.					; Petrie, Cameron/ABB-8528-2021; SINHA, RAJIV/AAC-6250-2022	Dixit, Yama/0000-0002-0700-5918; Petrie, Cameron/0000-0002-2926-7230; Hodell, David/0000-0001-8537-1588; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				JAN	2015	53	1					35	45		10.1007/s10933-014-9805-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-014-9805-3													WOS:000347293900003

Branchinectella media occurred during the winter at low water temperatures ranging between 5 and 16 degrees C and a salinity between 2.24 and 44 ppt (g/L), while P. spinosus preferred spring with a temperature range between 18 and 22 degrees C and a salinity from 12.08 to 48.6 ppt. The presence of both species overlapped only in March in the four sites. Phallocryptus spinosus always occurred with higher monthly densities between 5.2 +/- 0.99 and 27.7 +/- 3.81 ind.L-1 versus 1.65 +/- 0.64 to 10.55 +/- 0.78 ind.L-1 for B. media. Phallocryptus spinosus was two times larger than B. media (F = 26.80, P < 0.001) and its females were two times more fertile (t = 12.89, P < 0.0001) in the four sites. From the present study, we concluded that B. media, which is considered as a rare species according to the literature, was sensitive to environmental factors, mainly the temperature, and was dominated by P. spinosus, making it vulnerable, especially to the effects of the predicted climate warming.

J	Brisco, S; Ziegler, S				Brisco, S; Ziegler, S			Effects of solar radiation on the utilization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from two headwater streams	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The effect of solar radiation on dissolved organic matter (DOM) utilization was studied in 2 contrasting streams in Arkansas, USA, from June 2002 through July 2003. Moores Creek is an agricultural stream with elevated nutrient and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. Huey Hollow is a forest stream with low nutrient and DOC concentrations. A series of in situ experiments were conducted seasonally in both streams to assess how exposure of DOM to solar radiation impacted its utilization, measured as bacterial production following exposure and subsequent inoculation with whole stream water. Exposure of DOM to solar radiation significantly decreased its utilization during most seasons in both streams. Both streams experienced one period when exposure of DOM significantly increased bacterial production; during these periods, DOM appeared to be the least bioavailable and most photochemically reactive. In spring, ultraviolet absorption coefficients, normalized to DOC concentration, suggested a greater proportion of photoreactive DOM in Huey Hollow. Additionally the delta(13)C signature of DOM (delta(13)C(DOM)) suggested the largest terrestrial input occurred in spring when exposure of DOM significantly increased bacterial production. Both the proportion of photoreactive DOM and delta(13)C(DOM) exhibited little seasonal variation in Moores Creek; however, the relative bioavailability of DOM did vary, suggesting some change in DOM composition. In spring the relative bioavailability of DOM was lowest in Moores Creek, and DOM exposure appeared to have further reduced its bioavailability. Elevated ammonium concentrations at this time suggest photochemically enhanced humification may be an important mechanism influencing DOM cycling, and warrants study in streams impacted by agricultural land use.

The participants were brought together serendipitously through a course organized by academic researchers and 'biohackers' from the community laboratory, Hackuarium. After discussion about lifeguards' gastrointestinal and dermatological ailments each season, the decision to pursue this participatory research project was made. In order to assess water quality, thereby testing the hypothesis that unsuspected pollution enters the lake each summer season, microbiological plating of water samples was proposed. Volunteers collected and analysed water samples over summer seasons (8 weeks in 2016, 2017 and 2020) from three sites around Montreux Bay, with tap and local river water samples as controls. Contamination of lake water was measured using standard microbiological methods, with growth media allowing quantitative assessment of abundance of several bacterial species. In particular, the focus was to quantify Escherichia coli, the classic bioindicator organism for raw sewage contamination. These open science data reveal peaks of bioindicator and other bacterial pollution in lake water samples during all sampling years. For the initial two sampling campaigns, increased microbial burdens occurred during a popular music festival, and were not simply dependent upon rainfall. In contrast, only scattered, lower level bioindicator pollution events occurred across the sampling period during the pandemic summer of 2020, when the festival was cancelled. This study confirms the power of participatory research: dedicated people on a budget can do meaningful environmental monitoring. These analyses suggest that better management, both to support water quality monitoring and for event organization, is essential, as sewage treatment facilities near many popular festivals, internationally, may need to cope with increased wastewater from visitors.

J	Dietrich, D; Arndt, H				Dietrich, D; Arndt, H			Benthic heterotrophic flagellates in an Antarctic melt water stream	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Investigations on the abundance, biomass and position of heterotrophic flagellates (HF) in the benthic microbial food web of a melt water stream on King George Island, Antarctic Peninsula, were undertaken during the Antarctic summer from 23rd December 1997 until 13th March 1998. Abundance and biomass of potential HF resources ( picophotoautotrophic and non-photoautotrophic bacteria) as well as potential predators on HF (ciliates and meiofauna) were also investigated. HF abundance ranged from approximately 9 x 10(3) to 81 x 10(3) cells cm(-3), values which fall into the same range as those found in lower latitudes. Numerically important benthic HF were euglenids, kinetoplastids, thaumatomastigids and especially chrysomonads. Most species identified have been shown to have a worldwide distribution. Abundance of the benthic ciliates ranged from 27 to 950 cells cm(-3). Mean bacterial abundance was 1.9 x 10(7) and 5.2 x 10(8) cells cm(-3) for picophotoautotrophic and non-photoautotrophic benthos, respectively. The well-developed microbial community was able to support the large number of nematods, gastotrichs, tardigrads and rotifers with abundances reaching more than 1000 individuals cm(-3). The largest portion of heterotrophic biomass was formed by the meiofauna with a mean of 63 mug C cm(-3), followed by that of the heterotrophic bacteria with 4.80 mug C cm(-3). Picophotoautotrophic bacteria contributed a mean of 1.37 mug C cm(-3). HF and ciliates mean biomass was 0.61 and 1.99 mug C cm(-3), respectively, with the HF biomass comprising between < 10 and 70% of the total protozoan biomass. The data obtained in this study identify the melt water stream as a hot-spot of heterotrophic microbial and meiofaunal activity during the austral summer. The HF in the melt water stream formed a diverse group in terms of taxa and potential feeding types. Chrysomonads, kinetoplastids, euglenids and thaumatomastigida were the most abundant taxa. A classification into feeding types identified an average of 34% of the total HF as bacterivorous while all others were able to utilise other, larger organisms as resources. Potential trophic interactions between HF and bacteria and higher trophic levels are discussed.

J	Voge, M				Voge, M			Plant size and fertility of Isoetes lacustris L in 20 lakes of Scandinavia: A field study	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												A relationship between the individual size and fertility of Isoetes lacustris in the habitat centres of different lakes was found. The maximum (mean) rosette size was 202.2 cm(2) and the maximum (mean) number of macrospores in a sporangium was 113.4; the minimum (mean) values were 13.8 cm(2) and 30.6 spores. Further correlations between vitality and fertility parameters were established. It is suggested that the main ecological factors responsible for the differences found in the lakes are effects of climate (including water temperature and duration of seasonal growth), which cause the differences in rosette size and fertility. The percentage of individuals with fertile sporangia was lowest in the slightly humic lakes with boreal climate and short summers, and highest in the clear lakes with temperate climate and long summers. Isoetes individuals showed increased size with depth.																			0003-9136						1997	139	2					171	185																WOS:A1997XC27100003

Across all lakes and fish sizes over the austral spring-summer period, shortfin eel guts were dominated numerically by fish prey (57% occurrence cf 42% in brown bullhead), while Diptera larvae were most commonly encountered in guts of brown bullhead (45% cf 14% in eels). Significant differences in % composition of animal contents in guts were detected between fish species and sampling occasions (n=4) but not between lakes. In contrast, stable isotope signatures of brown bullhead and shortfin eel did differ significantly between lakes but not between sampling occasions, indicating enduring sources of nutrition despite apparently differing ingestion patterns over time. The R mixing model MixSIAR indicated that shortfins likely assimilated higher proportions of fish prey carbon compared to brown bullheads, which appeared to show greater assimilation of invertebrates, consistent with the results of gut content analyses. Isotopic niche regions, calculated in nicheROVER using probabilistic ellipses, indicated that shortfin eels occupied at least c.60% of brown bullhead trophic niche, which occupied less than 30% of eel trophic niche in all but one lake. These estimates suggest that brown bullhead has higher potential to influence shortfin eel nutrition than vice versa, or that a broad trophic niche occupied by eels provides resilience to the effects of overlapping consumption patterns with invasive omnivores.

J	Harper, K				Harper, Kyle			The Environmental Fall of the Roman Empire	DAEDALUS												Global environmental history is currently being enriched by troves of new data, and new models of environmental variability and human impact. Earth scientists are rapidly expanding historians' knowledge of the paleoclimate through the recovery and analysis of climate proxies such as ice cores, tree rings, stalagmites, and marine and lake sediments. Further, archaeologists and anthropologists are using novel techniques and methods to study the history of health and disease, as revealed through examination of bones and paleomolecular evidence. These possibilities open the way for historians to participate in a conversation about the long history of environmental change and human response. This essay considers how one of the most classic of all historical questions-the fall of the Roman Empire-can receive an answer enriched by new knowledge about the role of environmental change.

Altogether, 63 zooplankton species were identified, with 40 Rotifera, 15 Cladocera, and eight Copepoda. Among the Rotifera, 23 species were considered to be rare (< 25%), 11 were considered as frequent (25-75%), and seven as constant (> 75%). Regarding the Cladocera, seven species were considered rare, seven frequent, and just one was considered as constant. One Copepoda species was considered rare, four were frequent, and three constant. An increase in diversity of the zooplankton groups was found during the spring and summer months. The most abundant Rotifera species were: Conochilus unicornis, Kellicotia bostoniensis, and Polyarthra vulgaris, all above 18,000ind.m(-3). Among the Cladocera, Bosmina hagmanni was the most abundant species, with an average value of 20,313ind.m(-3), followed by Ceriodaphnia cornuta var. rigaudi with 3,912ind.m(-3). Among the Copepoda, nauplii of Cyclopoid prevailed, with an average value of 47,756ind.m(-3). For adults, higher abundances (above 1,300ind.m(-3)) were observed for Thermocyclops minutus, Thermocyclops decipiens, and Microcyclops anceps; for Calanoida, Notodiaptomus spiniger was the most abundant. The richness of species of zooplankton found in the present study was consistent with that expected for oligo-mesotrophic reservoirs.

Examining the factors that influence collective vigilance and exploring how individual vigilance is organized at the group level can help to understand how prey groups respond to potential threats. We quantified collective vigilance and determined its temporal pattern in a natural wintering population of the hooded crane Grus monacha in the Shengjin Lake reserve in China. We examined the role of flock size and anthropogenic disturbances in the human-dominated landscape on collective vigilance and level of synchronization. The proportion of time during which at least one individual scanned the surroundings (collective vigilance) increased with flock size and was higher in the more disturbed buffer zone of the lake. Synchronization of vigilance occurred more frequently in the smaller flocks but was not related to the risk of disturbance. Synchronization implies that individuals tend to monitor and copy the vigilance of neighbors. In the degraded wetlands, the wintering hooded crane benefits from foraging in groups and synchronizing their vigilance in response to human disturbances.

J	Mohanty, D; Adhikary, SP				Mohanty, Debabrata; Adhikary, Siba Prasad			Study on the salinity gradient of Chilika lake before and after opening of new mouth to sea and its impact on seaweed diversity	INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES												Chilika lake, popularly known as chilka lake showed wide variation in salinity in its 4 sectors varying from almost zero in the Northern sector to 33 ppt in the Outer channel sector during the last decade of the 20th Century. Changes in the salinity gradient of Chilika at its different sectors after opening of a new mouth to Bay of Bengal in 2001 and it influence on seaweed diversity of the lagoon was assessed. Due to influx of seawater from the Bay of Bengal the Outer channel sector, especially after opening of the mouth remained higher throughout the year in all the seasons showing 8 to 15.7 ppt in post-monsoon, 22 to 28.5 ppt in winter and 32 to 35 ppt in summer seasons which was much higher than the salinity level of the lake in 2000. Comparative study of qualitative and quantitative occurrence of seaweeds in different sector in 2011 with the earlier reports up to 2000 showed that Chaetomorpha linum was recorded in all the sectors of the lagoon though earlier it was not recorded in the Northern sector prior to opening of the new mouth. Similarly Enteromorpha compressa recorded in Northern sector and Central sector at low to moderate salinity which was earlier confined to Central sector only. Enteromorpha intestinalis presently occurring all through the lake in abundance was earlier recorded in lower quantity in the Central and Southern sectors at moderate salinity levels. Growth of Gracilaria verrucosa was earlier recorded from Southern and Central sector only, however, it appeared in the Outer channel sector due to increase in salinity all through the lagoon. RAPD analysis showed that the two different of Gracilaria verrucosa occurring in the lagoon are genetically different, hence, could be two different ecophene of the species.

Various leisure activities are involved during these visits, including cleaning and 'airing' the cottage after long-winters, activities at the lakes and dock building etc, exposing the Canadians to moist soil and decaying woods - a source of white or tan mould Blastomyces dermatitidis that may cause a flu-like illness to severe pneumonia that often remains a diagnostic challenge and results in delay in diagnosis and appropriate treatment thereby increasing associated morbidity and mortality. Case Presentations: Five cases of overwhelming acute blastomycosis pneumonia are presented. Four of the five patients presented within few weeks of their visit to the cottages and surrounding lakes and all were initially treated as "community acquired pneumonia" that resulted in delay in diagnosis and poor outcome in the first patient. The first case, however, taught an important lesson that led to high-index of suspicion in the others with early diagnosis and improved outcomes. Interestingly, all patients were obese and had a shorter incubation period and severe clinical course. The possible mechanism for early and severe disease in association with obesity is speculated and literature is reviewed. Conclusion: High-index of suspicion is important in the early diagnosis and appropriate management acute blastomycosis pneumonia to improve associated morbidity and mortality.

J	Walraevens, K; Bakundukize, C; Mtoni, YE; Van Camp, M				Walraevens, Kristine; Bakundukize, Charles; Mtoni, Yohana Enock; Van Camp, Marc			Understanding the hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater in Precambrian basement aquifers: A case study of Bugesera region in Burundi	JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION												This study investigates hydrogeochemical processes controlling groundwater evolution in a Precambrian basement aquifer situated in northeastern Burundi, in Bugesera region. The hydrogeochemistry has been evaluated based on the analytical results of 143 water samples comprising 66 samples from shallow wells, 61 samples from springs, and 16 samples from the shallow lakes. While the stability diagrams, the evolutionary sequence of groundwater inferred from the Piper diagram and bivariate plots highlight the weathering of aluminosilicates as the primary process controlling groundwater chemistry in this aquifer, the increasing trend of chloride levels between the highlands (recharge area) and the depression of Bugesera (discharge area) and the random distribution of high nitrate content even in water samples from springs suggest that additional processes such as evaporative concentration and anthropogenic pollution play a secondary role in the hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater. The spatial distribution of different hydrogeochemical parameters shows a general increasing trend from the highlands where water samples, mainly from springs, show low mineralisation (TDS = 26-152 mg/l) and low pH (field pH = 4.6-6.6), towards the depression of Bugesera where higher values of mineralisation (TDS = 44-3229 mg/l) and pH (field pH = 5.6-7.7) are observed. The overriding control of aluminosilicates weathering on the hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater in Bugesera region is clearly demonstrated by the predominance of NaHCO3 and CaHCO3 water types and the cross-plots which show an increasing trend of alkaline and alkaline earth cations (Na+ + K+ + Ca2+ + Mg2+) released from the weathering of aluminosilicates along the flow line. Moreover, the poor correlation between the concentrations of SiO2 and Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, HCO3- and TDS reflects the incongruent character of the weathering of aluminosilicates which causes part of the silica released from the weathering of silicates to be taken up into the neoformation of clay minerals. The anthropogenic pollution is reflected by the occurrence of NaNO3, CaNO3, KNO3 and NaSO4 types even in spring water.																			0375-6742	1879-1689				MAY	2018	188						24	42		10.1016/j.gexplo.2018.01.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gexplo.2018.01.003													WOS:000428134600003

Despite the high annual evaporation to precipitation ratio in the area, lake water electrical conductivity is usually lower than 1000 mu S/cm, this may be due to high seepage from the floor of the lake. Therefore, the hypothesis of possible underground connections between Namdan Basin, where the lake is located, and the surrounding basins with lower elevation (Aspas and Dehbid Basins) was investigated. Hydrogeology, hydrochemistry, and stable isotopes data of the lake and surrounding basins along with the lake water balance study were applied to test the hypothesis. Results indicate that Kaftar Lake has no connection with Aspas Basin in south, but it is hydraulically connected to Dehbid Basin. In Dehbid Basin, Ghasr_e_Yaghoob spring (average discharge 1200 L/s) emerges from a small outcrop (about 0.8 km2) of Daryan limestone Formation, where this outcrop is much smaller than the required recharge area for such average discharge rate. The study shows that this spring is recharged by Kaftar Lake and Namdan Basin aquifer, through Daryan Formation of Gandboee Syncline located to the northern part of the lake.

Analysis of the chemistry data from these samples provides information that allows description of the basic characteristics of the source waters when the dilution effects of surface runoff are lowest. During the late winter, the water in Yukon streams consists entirely of groundwater. Most of the dissolved constituents are at their highest concentrations during this period. This pattern persists from year to year. The data set was analysed using cluster analysis. The different groups of variables suggests that different mechanisms control each group. These groups show that geology, maritime influence and erosion dominate the patterns of observed water chemistry. The cluster analysis of stations produced groups of stations that have similar chemistry.

J	BOSTROM, B; PETTERSSON, K				BOSTROM, B; PETTERSSON, K			SPRING DEVELOPMENT OF PHYTOPLANKTON IN LAKE ERKEN	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												In Lake Erken (Sweden) there is a regular phytoplankton peak at ice breakup in the spring. Pechlaner (1970) studied the spring outburst of 1960. A similar study was done in 1973, when the climatic factors were different, having only 10 cm of ice and almost no snow. Thus, due to light penetration, there was a high phytoplankton biomass under the ice as early as March. Stephanodiscus astraea (Ehr.) Grun. and Asterionella formosa Hass. dominated the biomass during the spring development in 1973 instead of the normally dominating S. hantzschii var. pusillus Grun. The nutrient decrease was slower in 1973 than in 1960. A comparison of C assimilation and the decrease of nitrate and phosphate indicated sufficient nutrient supply in 1973. In 1960, the population grew logarithmically until the nutrients became limiting. In 1973, the average biomass was greater, but the mean probable primary production was half that of 1960. From the activity coefficients for the 2 yr it showed that, in 1960, S. hantzschii var. pusillus was highly productive during its short and intensive growth period. Its minute size and high surface/volume ratio enabled it to take up nutrients rapidly and efficiently. The chlorophyll content of S. astraea in 1973 was half as much as that of S. hantzschii var. pusillus in 1960. Since the light conditions under the ice in March 1973 were more unfavorable than during the exponential phase of 1960, production was much lower.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1977	7	4					327	335		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1977.tb01680.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1977.tb01680.x													WOS:A1977DS27400003

Field observations and model results of the dynamic and water-quality parameters indicated that the triggering mechanism of the hypoxia was strong stratification formed by the freshwater discharge from both dykes, which limited the dissolved oxygen (DO) supply in bottom water. Beneath the pycnocline, DO was consumed by sediment oxygen demand (SOD) during the summer. To investigate these processes, model experiments were conducted using a simplified DO budget model coupled with a 3D hydrodynamic model. The DO concentration in the northern part of CSB reached hypoxic conditions very quickly after 3.4 days of discharge and lasted 18 days until normal conditions resumed. In sum, in the CSB, marked stratification and its maintenance played a critical role in hypoxia in bottom water. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Informants living near navigable rivers and large lakes perceive movement by water as one of the ordinary components of the transport system, while those living far from water bodies treat water transport with caution and prejudice, emphasizing the dan-ger of the water element. The most vivid impressions of dialect speakers about move-ment in space are associated with air trans-port. The narrative of this event is clothed in the genre form of a "story-plate", which occu-pies an intermediate position between eve ry-day and folklore non-fairy-tale prose. How-ever, such stories, as a rule, tell about the fi rst or only air fl ight in the life of the informant.

Climate induced birch mortality in Trans-Baikal lake region, Siberia	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The Trans-Baikal (or Zabailkal'e) region includes the forest-steppe ecotones south and east of Lake Baikal in Russia and has experienced drought for several years. The decline and mortality of birch (Betula pendula) stands within the forest-steppe ecotone Trans-Baikal region was studied based on a temporal series of satellite data, ground measurements, and tree ring analysis. During the first decade of the 21st century birch stands decline and mortality were observed on about 5% of the total area of stands within our 1250 km(2) study area. Birch forest decline and mortality occurs mainly at the margins of stands, within the forest-steppe ecotone on slopes with direct insolation. During the first decade of the 21st century summer (June-August) precipitation was about 25% below normal. Soil water content measurements were lowest within dead stands and highest within healthy stands and intermediate within damaged stands. Drought impact on stands was amplified by an increase in summer air temperatures (+0.9 degrees C) in comparison with the previous decade. Tree ring data of "surviving" and "dead" tree groups showed a positive correlation with summer/annual precipitation and negative correlation with summer air temperatures. Temperature and precipitation extreme anomalies tend to occur in the region with a period of about 27 years. The observed anomaly was the most severe since the beginning of meteorological observations in the year 1900. Data for the other sites showed a positive climate impact on the growth and expansion of Siberian forests. That is, the same species (B. pendula) showed considerable increase (1.4 times both in height and stem volume) during 20th-21st centuries as temperature increased but precipitation remained at adequate levels.

Reducing the impact of summer cattle grazing on water quality in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California: a proposal	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												The Sierra Nevada Mountain range serves as an important source of drinking water for the State of California. However, summer cattle grazing on federal lands affects the overall water quality yield from this essential watershed as cattle manure is washed into the lakes and streams or directly deposited into these bodies of water. This organic pollution introduces harmful microorganisms and also provides nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus which increase algae growth causing eutrophication of otherwise naturally oligotrophic mountain lakes and streams. Disinfection and filtration of this water by municipal water districts after it flows downstream will become increasingly costly. This will be compounded by increasing surface water temperatures and the potential for toxins release by cyanobacteria blooms. With increasing demands for clean water for a state population approaching 40 million, steps need to be implemented to mitigate the impact of cattle on the Sierra Nevada watershed. Compared to lower elevations, high elevation grazing has the greatest impact on the watershed because of fragile unforgiving ecosystems. The societal costs from non-point pollution exceed the benefit achieved through grazing of relatively few cattle at the higher elevations. We propose limiting summer cattle grazing on public lands to lower elevations, with a final goal of allowing summer grazing on public lands only below 1,500 m elevation in the Central and Northern Sierra and 2,000 m elevation in the Southern Sierra.

Submerged macrophytes enhance carbon emission (CO2 and CH4) from the freshwater wetland in Keibul Lamjao National Park, Manipur, India	LIMNOLOGICA												Worldwide, the exacerbation of global warming has accelerated the growth of submerged macrophytes in wetlands, thereby substantiating the supply of labile substrates for carbon (CH4 and CO2) emissions. Nevertheless, limited studies have been conducted on carbon emission from tropical wetlands with submerged macrophytes. In the current study an attempt has been made to reveal the role of submerged macrophytes in influencing carbon flux from a natural wetland in the Indo-Burma Biodiversity hotspots. The submerged macrophytes colonising the shallow freshwater wetland of Keibul Lamjao comprise of Hydrilla verticillata, Ceratophyllum demersum, and Potamogeton crispus, with primary productivity at community level ranging between 20.72 and 152.53 g m-2 d-1 (mean, 95.6 +/- 54.66 g m-2 d-1). This study gives a comparative analysis of the carbon gases (CH4 and CO2) emission in two distinct zones of the wetland: areas with profuse submerged macrophytic growth and water free of macrophytes. The mean CO2 and CH4 emissions from the zone with submerged macrophytes were 8362.64 +/- 2935.57 and 227.90 +/- 73.50 mg m-2 d-1, respectively, compared to 5558.07 +/- 1222.05 and 149.72 +/- 20.44 mg m-2 d-1 from those without macrophytes. The CO2 and CH4 emissions peak during the summer and wane in the following seasons, with minimum emissions occurring during the winter. It is apparent from the results that the generation of the gases in the wetland was temperature dependent, plus the macrophytic detritus availability. The carbon emissions were significantly correlated with the physicochemical properties of the water and the lake bottom sediment. A significantly positive correlation between carbon emission and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and organic matter (OM) was established in the zone with macrophytes, thereby revealing that the growth of submerged macrophytes in the wetland enhances atmospheric carbon emissions.					; Khoiyangbam, R S/ABE-7358-2021	RS, Khoiyangbam/0000-0002-6508-8782; 													0075-9511	1873-5851				NOV	2023	103								126125	10.1016/j.limno.2023.126125	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2023.126125		NOV 2023											WOS:001115520200001

Walleye Sander vitreus (Mitchill) are relatively resistant to experimental infection with VHSV IVb and extant walleye strains vary in susceptibility	JOURNAL OF FISH DISEASES												Compared to fathead minnow, walleye demonstrate low susceptibility to experimental infection with VHSV IVb, regardless of route of exposure or water temperature at time of infection. In triplicate and duplicate groups, walleye were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected (10(2)-10(8)pfu/fish) or waterborne-exposed (w; 1.4x10(7)pfumL(-1)) with VHSV IVb. High cumulative mortality (64-100%) and severe gross lesions associated with VHSV IVb infection were evident only in fish i.p. injected with 10(8)pfu at 12 degrees C. These fish had multifocal necrosis of several tissues including the gill and heart. There was no difference in mortality between walleye infected (w or i.p.) at 12 degrees C (spring stocking) compared with a declining temperature profile from 18 to 12 degrees C (fall stocking). There were significant differences (P<0.05) in mortality between four extant walleye strains following i.p. infection, indicating that the choice of walleye strain for stocking might be an important consideration. Viral antigen was found in both i.p. and w-exposed walleye using immunohistochemistry, mostly within the gill and skin of w-exposed fish and most prominently in dermal fibrocytes. VHSV IVb was detected in multiple tissues from 6 to 21days post-infection using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).

The focus of the investigations were two meromictic pit lakes and their adjacent aquifers. In order to follow hydrodynamic processes between lake and groundwater, mixing patterns within the lakes as well as ages of lake and groundwater, water samples of ground- and lake water were collected at three occasions, representing summer and winter conditions in the aquatic systems. The water samples were analysed for stable isotopes (deuterium, oxygen-18) and tritium and sulphurhexafluoride (SF6 concentration). Lake water profiles of conductivity and 18O could validate the permanent stratification pattern of both the lakes. Groundwater data sets showed a heterogeneous local distribution in stable isotope values between rain and lake water. A two-component mixing model had been adopted only from 18O data to determine lake water proportions in the surrounding groundwater wells in order to correct measured tritium and SF6 concentrations in groundwater samples. This procedure had been hampered by upstream-located wells indicating strong 18O enrichment in groundwater samples. However, rough groundwater ages were estimated. For both study sites, Piston flow ages between 12.9 and 27.7 years were calculated. The investigations showed the good agreement between two different environmental dating tools, considering the marginal data sets.																			1025-6016						2010	46	3					291	298	PII 924563583	10.1080/10256016.2010.502592	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10256016.2010.502592								20645204					WOS:000281851900004
J	Gervais, F				Gervais, F			Ecology of cryptophytes coexisting near a freshwater chemocline	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. A deep chlorophyll maximum dominated by Cryptomonas phaseolus, Cryptomonas undulata and often also by Cryptomonas rostratiformis was observed near the summer chemocline of the dimictic, meso-eutrophic lake Schlachtensee from 1990 to 1996. 2. The cryptophyte populations occupied a stratified water column of about 2 m thickness just below the oxycline. They were never observed in the summer epilimnion. In their habitat, oxygen concentration was always lower than 1 mg L-1 and light was growth-limiting, whereas nitrogen and phosphorus were available at high concentrations. 3. A very large portion of the populations stayed in the anaerobic, sulphide-containing water layer. Below the chemocline, purple and green sulphur bacteria coexisted. 4. The cryptophyte populations were maintained by in situ growth due to low-light adapted photosynthesis and not due to phagotrophy. 5. Short-term changes in the light climate near the chemocline could explain the coexistence of different cryptophyte species.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				FEB	1998	39	1					61	78		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00260.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00260.x													WOS:000072105100006

Means of genic heterozygosity (H) and polymorphism (P) were very low in Cyprinodon tularosa and C. pecosensis (.hivin.H = .017-.027; .hivin.P = .04 - 0.7). In C. bovinus and C. elegans the values for those indices of variability were higher (.hivin.H = .045-.050; .hivin.P = .13-.15) and near the averages previously reported for fishes. The highest variability (H = .084-.123; P = .25-.29) occurred in two widely separated samples from the Pecos River in Texas where C. pecosensis has hybridized with introduced individuals of C. variegatus. Spatial heterogeneity in allelic frequencies was low (FST = .011) in C. bovinus, the species occupying the most continuous, and geographically most restricted habitat (small spring system). The higher heterogeneities in C. tularosa (.19) and C. pecosensis (.08) are associated with relatively strong geographic isolation of subpopulations. High heterogeneity (.11) also occurred in C. elegans, a species of a single complex of springs and irrigation canals. On the average, approx. 8% of the total genic diversity in C. elegans is explained by differences between samples from within the four major populations of the species (three spring systems and an associated creek), while only 3% is due to differences between subpopulations. The difference between populations of C. elegans is primarily due to divergence of the one in Phantom Lake Spring.																			0045-8511	1938-5110				AUG 5	1987		3					668	681																WOS:A1987J603400010

Until recently, fossil collections from the area were not stratigraphically controlled, owing to the lack of a detailed stratigraphic and chronologic framework. Our field studies reveal at least nine exposed thin rhythmic fining- upward depositional packages, most separated by disconformities. Analysis of interbedded tephras reveals that the Rye Patch Dam (-646 ka), Dibekulewe (-610 ka), Tulelake T64 (-95 ka), Marble Bluff ( 47 ka), and Trego Hot Springs ( 23.2 ka) tephra layers are present in the section, indicating deposition from more than -646 ka to less than 23 ka, which includes both the late Irvingtonian and Rancholabrean North American land mammal ages, a much longer time span than previously believed. Bones analyzed from eight of the defined units have distinctly different rare earth element ( REE) signatures. Fossils obtain REE during early diagenesis, and signatures are probably closely related to lake water compositions. REE signatures in fossils from lower packages suggest uptake from neutral pH waters. In contrast, REE signatures become increasingly heavy REE-enriched up-section, with positive Ce anomalies in the upper units. REE signatures in fossils from the upper units are very similar to waters from modern alkaline lakes, such as Lake Abert, Oregon, suggesting diagenetic uptake in increasingly alkaline and saline waters. These REE changes suggest increasing aridity up-section, a contention reinforced by the habitat preferences of the terrestrial vertebrates preserved.

However, they are also frequently associated with toxic blooms, named cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs). This paper reports on an unusual out-of-season cyanoHAB and its dynamics during the COVID-19 pandemic, in Lake Avernus, South Italy. Fast detection strategy (FDS) was used to assess this phenomenon, through the integration of satellite imagery and biomolecular investigation of the environmental samples. Data obtained unveiled a widespread Microcystis sp. bloom in February 2020 (i.e., winter season in Italy), which completely disappeared at the end of the following COVID-19 lockdown, when almost all urban activities were suspended. Due to potential harmfulness of cyanoHABs, crude extracts from the "winter bloom" were evaluated for their cytotoxicity in two different human cell lines, namely normal dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) and breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7). The chloroform extract was shown to exert the highest cytotoxic activity, which has been correlated to the presence of cyanotoxins, i.e., microcystins, micropeptins, anabaenopeptins, and aeruginopeptins, detected by molecular networking analysis of liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) data.

The 32-year record-high surface melt in 2019/2020 on the northern George VI Ice Shelf, Antarctic Peninsula	CRYOSPHERE												In the 2019/2020 austral summer, the surface melt duration and extent on the northern George VI Ice Shelf (GVIIS) was exceptional compared to the 31 previous summers of distinctly lower melt. This finding is based on analysis of near-continuous 41-year satellite microwave radiometer and scatterometer data, which are sensitive to meltwater on the ice shelf surface and in the near-surface snow. Using optical satellite imagery from Landsat 8 (2013 to 2020) and Sentinel-2 (2017 to 2020), record volumes of surface meltwater ponding were also observed on the northern GVIIS in 2019/2020, with 23% of the surface area covered by 0.62 km(3) of ponded meltwater on 19 January. These exceptional melt and surface ponding conditions in 2019/2020 were driven by sustained air temperatures >= 0 degrees C for anomalously long periods (55 to 90 h) from late November onwards, which limited meltwater refreezing. The sustained warm periods were likely driven by warm, low-speed (<= 7.5 m s(-1)) northwesterly and northeasterly winds and not by foehn wind conditions, which were only present for 9 h total in the 2019/2020 melt season. Increased surface ponding on ice shelves may threaten their stability through increased potential for hydrofracture initiation; a risk that may increase due to firn air content depletion in response to near-surface melting.					; Brucker, Ludovic/ACJ-3763-2022; Moussavi, Mahsa/B-4051-2016; Dell, Rebecca/MXM-0655-2025; Banwell, Alison/W-8180-2018; Picard, Ghislain/D-4246-2013	Dell, Rebecca/0000-0001-6617-3906; Datta, Rajashree Tri/0000-0003-2241-0687; Stevens, Laura A./0000-0003-0480-8018; Banwell, Alison/0000-0001-9545-829X; Brucker, Ludovic/0000-0001-7102-8084; Picard, Ghislain/0000-0003-1475-5853													1994-0416	1994-0424				FEB 25	2021	15	2					909	925		10.5194/tc-15-909-2021	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-909-2021													WOS:000627572900001
J	Findikakis, AN; Law, AWK				Findikakis, AN; Law, AWK			Wind mixing in temperature simulations for lakes and reservoirs	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												A one-dimensional mathematical formulation for simulating the wind mixing of the surface layers in reservoirs and lakes is developed. Emphasis is placed on the estimation of the net available wind-supplied energy for mixing by taking into consideration the variability of the wind in time. The formulation of the dynamics of the wind-mixed layer presented in this paper is implemented in a modified version of the one-dimensional Massachusetts Institute of Technology reservoir model. The model was used to predict the annual cycle of the thermal structure of Spada Lake in northwestern Washington State. A complete record of inflow and outflow water temperatures, temperature profiles in the reservoir, and meteorological data at the site over a 16-month period provided the basis for verifying the model. Special effort was made to screen and analyze these data to assure their quality. The application of the temperature model in Spada Lake produced good agreement between simulated and observed temperature profiles. Noticeable features of this application are the accurate simulation of the growth of the wind-mixed layer in the fall and the prediction of the exact time of formation and melting of the ice cover in the winter. These features could not have been predicted accurately without accounting for the variability of the wind pattern and its effect on the net available energy for mixing, as it was found in earlier simulations with simpler formulations of the wind-mixing effect.

J	Hurwitz, S; Lowenstern, JB				Hurwitz, Shaul; Lowenstern, Jacob B.			Dynamics of the Yellowstone hydrothermal system	REVIEWS OF GEOPHYSICS												The Yellowstone Plateau Volcanic Field is characterized by extensive seismicity, episodes of uplift and subsidence, and a hydrothermal system that comprises more than 10,000 thermal features, including geysers, fumaroles, mud pots, thermal springs, and hydrothermal explosion craters. The diverse chemical and isotopic compositions of waters and gases derive from mantle, crustal, and meteoric sources and extensive water-gas-rock interaction at variable pressures and temperatures. The thermal features are host to all domains of life that utilize diverse inorganic sources of energy for metabolism. The unique and exceptional features of the hydrothermal system have attracted numerous researchers to Yellowstone beginning with the Washburn and Hayden expeditions in the 1870s. Since a seminal review published a quarter of a century ago, research in many fields has greatly advanced our understanding of the many coupled processes operating in and on the hydrothermal system. Specific advances include more refined geophysical images of the magmatic system, better constraints on the time scale of magmatic processes, characterization of fluid sources and water-rock interactions, quantitative estimates of heat and magmatic volatile fluxes, discovering and quantifying the role of thermophile microorganisms in the geochemical cycle, defining the chronology of hydrothermal explosions and their relation to glacial cycles, defining possible links between hydrothermal activity, deformation, and seismicity; quantifying geyser dynamics; and the discovery of extensive hydrothermal activity in Yellowstone Lake. Discussion of these many advances forms the basis of this review.

J	Sahu, SN; Hossain, S; Sen, S; Ghoshal, K				Sahu, Sweta Narayan; Hossain, Sourav; Sen, Sumit; Ghoshal, Koeli			Sediment transport in ice-covered channel under non-equilibrium condition	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Many rivers and lakes located at high altitudes in different parts of the world experience ice conditions during the winter for prolonged period and an ice cover on the top causes a transition from an open flow state to a closed underflow one. The distribution of the suspended sediment concentration is presented under such condition where the concentration is a function of spatial coordinates along with time. Existing expressions of eddy viscosity and settling velocity are used that contain the combined effects of both the lower channel bed and the upper ice cover boundary. The flow is considered sediment free initially and assumes a uniform inlet condition. No mass transfer is taken on the ice cover surface and a constant reference concentration is assumed at the reference level. Numerical method (ADI method) has been utilized for the solution of the PDE in conjunction with the given initial and boundary conditions. It is found that with increasing time and downstream distance, concentration values first increase along a vertical and then reach a stable value. Following this, the solution is compared with the available experimental data at large time under far-field conditions. At the end, the concentration profiles are analysed by varying different parameters. It is seen that as the dimensionless correction coefficient present in the settling velocity expression increases, the concentration values also increase. An opposite result is found when the dimensionless proportionality constant present in the eddy viscosity expression is varied and in comparison to lower times, the amount of concentration change occurs rapidly with higher times.

The study covered three reservoirs in an agricultural area of Wielkopolska (central-western part of Poland). Assessing the agricultural impact required a network of piezometers around the reservoirs, used to determine the degree of groundwater pollution from nutrients supplied to the reservoirs. Moreover, the analysis covered the quality of water in streams flowing into the reservoirs, and in the reservoirs themselves. Field research was conducted every month of the growing season from March to November. The analysis covered land inclination, ground permeability, and soil type. Detailed objectives included: (1) assessment of the agricultural impact on the chemical parameters of ground and surface water quality, and (2) evaluation of the impact of different sources of agricultural pollution on water quality in artificial reservoirs in regards to their management. This study revealed high dynamics of nutrient concentrations, particularly for nitrates and phosphates, in groundwater and surface water. A significant effect of maize cultivation on an increase in nitrate concentrations in the groundwater of the catchment of the Przebedowo Reservoir was evidenced, as well as a substantial effect of the functioning of an animal farm on the quality of groundwaters in the catchment of the Lachotka Reservoir. The nutrient load of agricultural origin in the catchment of the Miedzichowo Reservoir was relatively low. Our study revealed elevated amounts of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, detected more frequently in groundwater than in running waters, which confirms our hypothesis of the importance of groundwater analysis in detecting the source of pollution of the studied lakes. High nutrient concentrations recorded in groundwater leached from arable fields were also observed in the summer period, failing to confirm the hypothesis that the greatest effect of factors would be related to the spring effect of arable fields on water quality (lack of compact vegetation cover, high water level, etc.). Our study also indicated a greater importance of the type of land use than lithology or permeability of deposits.

Is there anybody out there? Occupancy of the carnivore guild in a temperate archipelago	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY												Carnivores are important components of ecological communities with wide-ranging effects that vary with carnivore size, natural history, and hunting tactics. Researchers and managers should strive to understand both the presence and distribution of carnivores within their local environment. We studied the carnivore guild in the Apostle Islands, where the distribution and occupancy of carnivores was largely unknown. We monitored 19 islands with 160 functioning camera traps from 2014-2017, from which we collected 203,385 photographs across 49,280 trap nights. We documented 7,291 total wildlife events with 1,970 carnivore events, and detected 10 of the 12 terrestrial carnivores found in Wisconsin. Detection rates for species were generally higher in summer than winter, except for coyotes (Canis latrans) and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes). Finite-sample occupancy estimates for carnivores varied across islands, with mean estimated occupancy across islands varying from a high of 0.73 for black bears to a low of 0.21 for gray wolves. Of the potential island biogeography explanatory variables for carnivore occupancy we considered, island size was the most important, followed by distance to the mainland, and then inter-island distance. We estimated that terrestrial carnivore species varied in the number of islands they were detected on from 1 island for gray wolves to 13 islands for black bears. Estimated carnivore richness across islands (i.e., the number of carnivores occupying an island) also varied substantively from 1 species on Michigan Island to 10 species on Stockton Island. Island size and connectivity between islands appear important for the persistence of the carnivore community in the Apostle Islands.

J	Leesch, D; Müller, W; Nielsen, E; Bullinger, J				Leesch, Denise; Mueller, Werner; Nielsen, Ebbe; Bullinger, Jerome			The Magdalenian in Switzerland: Re-colonization of a newly accessible landscape	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												During the Last Glacial Maximum, Switzerland was almost entirely covered with ice. However, in the ice-free region situated less than 50 km north of the glaciers, human occupation is confirmed as early as 23,000 cal BP. Numerous sedimentary sequences in lakes and mires have produced a wealth of proxy data indicating that environmental conditions improved rapidly after the melting of the glaciers that liberated the Swiss Plateau at least at c. 17,500 cal BP, offering severe but possible life conditions to plant, animal and human communities. Contrary to what has long been the prevailing opinion, Magdalenian re-colonization of Switzerland did not start with the onset of the warming of Greenland Interstadial 1e, but well before. According to most of the recently obtained AMS dates, the Magdalenian occupation falls within the cold, treeless, environment of the Oldest Dryas period; it is even conceivable that it did not extend into Greenland Interstadial 1 e. More than 50 sites, among which famous caves and rockshelters such as Kesslerloch and Schweizersbild, as well as large open-air campsites like Monruz and Moosbuhl, have produced different techno-assemblages that find good comparisons in the rest of Europe. In contrast to the exploitation of mainly local and regional flint sources, the use of "exotic" ornamental/symbolic objects - fossil mollusks, amber and jet - shows widespread, multidirectional long-distance connections with the upper Danube basin, the Mainz basin, the Paris Basin, the Atlantic coast, the Mediterranean and even the Baltic regions.

Bottomfast ice mapping and the measurement of ice thickness on tundra lakes using C-band synthetic aperture radar remote sensing	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Industrial activity in Canada's north is increasing, placing demands on the use of water from lakes to build ice roads. Winter water withdrawal from these lakes has the potential to impact overwintering fish. Removal of water from small lakes can decrease oxygen and habitat available to fish. To address this issue, a protocol has been developed by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans outlining water withdrawal thresholds. Bathymetric surveys are the traditional method to determine lake depth, but are costly given the remoteness of northern lakes. This paper investigates the use of satellite C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing technology as a potential alternative or complement to traditional survey methods. Previous research has shown that a SAR can detect the transition from grounded to floating ice on lakes, or if a lake is completely frozen. Grounded ice has a dark signature while floating ice appears very bright in contrast. Similar results were observed for the datasets acquired in the study area. This suggests that lakes that freeze completely to the bottom can be identified using SAR. Such water bodies would not be viable fish overwintering habitat and can therefore be used as water sources without thresholds necessary. However, attempts to accurately calculate the depth of the ice at the grounded-floating ice boundary using bathymetric profiles acquired in the summer and lake ice thickness measurements from a reference lake near Inuvik proved to be unreliable.

The main goal of our contribution is to understand the climatic significance of the oxygen-isotope variations in and between the different carbonate species and ideally provide a quantitative estimate of the oxygen isotopic composition of meteoric precipitation, which then could be translated to mean temperature estimates. Corrected for the respective vital offsets, the different carbonates show almost identical oxygen-isotope ratios for the time preceding and after the rapid transition from Greenland climate stages GS2 to GI1, indicating low and seasonally constant water temperatures at the sediment-water interface for this period. In the following the difference between cold season and warm-season carbonates increases gradually, pointing to a summer-winter temperature difference of roughly 10 K at the end of GI1. We conclude that this gradual water-temperature increase is independent of climate and is mainly due to sedimentation, shallowing the sediment-water interface, eventually accentuated by a gradual decrease of Gerzensee's water level during GI1. Corrected for the isotope fractionation induced by the long term trend of such water temperature change, the higher resolved delta O-18 record from the bulk carbonates allows calculation of the presumed oxygen-isotope ratio of former lake water (delta O-18(L)), which shows striking similarity to the record from Ammersee. Introducing a tentative hydrological correction close to the present day offset between delta O-18(L) and the oxygen-isotopes in meteoric precipitation (delta O-18(P)), we propose a quantitative delta O-18(P) and mean air temperature record for the Gerzensee region.

J	George, DC; Hewitt, DP				George, DC; Hewitt, DP			The impact of year-to-year changes in the weather on the dynamics of Daphnia in a thermally stratified lake	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												The factors influencing the seasonal dynamics of Daphnia in a thermally stratified lake (Esthwaite Water) are described and related to long-term changes in the weather. The Daphnia produced three cohorts in the year and the strength of the cohorts was determined by year-to-year variations in the physical characteristics of the lake and the abundance of edible algae. Food was most abundant in early summer when small, fast-growing flagellates were particularly common. In late summer, the phytoplankton community was dominated by large, inedible species but edible forms re-appeared when nutrients were entrained by wind mixing. Examples are presented to demonstrate the effect that year-to-year variations in the weather have on the growth of the phytoplankton and the dynamics of the Daphnia. In 'good' years, when the lake stratifies early and there are periods of episodic mixing in summer, there are two pulses' of edible algae and two strong cohorts of Daphnia. In 'bad' years when stratification is delayed and there is little episodic mixing, the growth of the edible algae is suppressed and the Daphnia produce two weak cohorts. The results are discussed in relation to the impact of intermediate disturbances on growth of phytoplankton and current theories of population regulation in Daphnia. The evidence suggests that the dynamics of the Daphnia in the lake are strongly influenced by seasonal variations in the mixing regime, the recycling of nutrients and the episodic growth of edible algae.																			1386-2588	1573-5125				MAR	2006	40	1					33	47		10.1007/s10452-005-9013-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-005-9013-3													WOS:000235545900004

Survival, reproduction, and recruitment of gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) at the northwestern edge of its native range	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												South Dakota (SD) represents the northwestern edge of gizzard shad's (Dorosoma cepedianum) native range. However, with recent climate warming the gizzard shad is experiencing a natural range expansion northward. Little knowledge exists regarding temperatures that are required for overwinter survival, and less is known regarding population dynamics of gizzard shad in these populations. The objectives of this research were to determine the extent of reproduction, recruitment, and overwinter survival after annual introductions of adult gizzard shad in two northeastern SD glacial lakes relative to other SD systems. Prior to spawning, the gizzard shad was introduced into East Krause Lake and Middle Lynn Lake and successfully spawned during 2008 and 2009. Mean (+/- SE) peak larval abundances (number/100 m(3)) were 3.87 (+/- 1.87) and 1.72 (+/- 0.89) in East Krause Lake and 0.79 (+/- 0.22) and 0.17 (+/- 0.11) in Middle Lynn Lake in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Larval abundances were lower than those observed in most other SD populations. Survival to fall age-0 was documented in both years in Middle Lynn Lake, but only during 2008 in East Krause Lake. No overwinter survival was documented. Low water temperatures and rapidly cooling water likely caused overwinter mortality of gizzard shad in these systems. Temperature at the sediment water interface during the winter of 2009-2010 was below 2.2 degrees C for 114 and 62 consecutive days in East Krause Lake and Middle Lynn Lake, respectively.

In this study, we reconstructed the hydrological and climate changes of the paleolake since similar to 40 ka based on multiple organic matter geochemical (total organic carbon, total nitrogen, C/N ratios, and delta C-13) and grain size proxies. The results show that in the Hetao Basin, the lake level was relatively high with a high aquatic productivity and a flourishing aquatic ecosystem between similar to 40 ka and 27 ka. The climate was warm and humid during the late MIS 3 period. The abrupt decrease in the productivity of the aquatic plants after 27 ka indicates that the lake level dropped or the lake dried up as the climatic conditions deteriorated and the passage of the Yellow River together. The deteriorating climatic conditions after 27 ka were caused by the weakness of the Asian summer monsoon, which was caused by the low summer insolation in the Northern Hemisphere in the Hetao Basin since the late MIS 3.

J	Henderson, AK; Shuman, BN				Henderson, Anna King; Shuman, Bryan Nolan			Differing controls on river- and lake-water hydrogen and oxygen isotopic values in the western United States	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Surface water oxygen and hydrogen isotopic values are commonly used as proxies of precipitation isotopic values to track modern hydrologic processes while proxies of water isotopic values preserved in lake and river sediments are used for paleoclimate and paleoaltimetry studies. Previous work has been able to explain variability in USA river-water and meteoric-precipitation oxygen isotope variability with geographic variables. These studies show that in the western United States, river-water isotopic values are depleted relative to precipitation values. In comparison, the controls on lake-water isotopic values are not well constrained. It has been documented that western United States lake-water input values, unlike river water, reflect the monthly weighted mean isotopic value of precipitation. To understand the differing controls on lake- and river-water isotopic values in the western United States, we examine the seasonal distribution of precipitation, evaporation and snowmelt across a range of seasonality regimes. We generate new predictive equations based on easily measured factors for western United States lake- water, which are able to explain 69-63% of the variability in lake- water hydrogen and oxygen isotopic values. In addition to the geographic factors that can explain river and precipitation values, lake- water isotopic values need factors related to local hydrologic and climatic characteristics to explain variability. Study results suggest that the spring snowmelt runs off the landscape via rivers and streams, depleting river and stream-water isotopic values. By contrast, lakes receive seasonal contributions of precipitation in proportion to the seasonal fraction of total annual precipitation within their watershed. Climate change may alter the ratio of snow to rain fall, affecting water resource partitioning between rivers and lakes and by implication of groundwater. Paleolimnological studies must account for the multiple drivers of water isotopic values; likewise, studies based on the isotopic composition of fossil material need to distinguish between species that are associated with rivers versus lakes.

The He-3/He-4 ratio of the injected mantle He is estimated at He-3/He-4 = 9.43 +/- 0.17 x 10(-6), which is close to the highest value reported for volcanic gases from the Japanese Islands. Accumulation of mantle He in the near-bottom water can be reasonably explained by a diffusion process with a constant He flux from the lake bottom of f(He-4) = 9.2 x 10(7) atoms/cm2/s and f(He-3) = 8.7 x 10(2) atoms/cm2/s. The heat/He-3 ratio (1.7 x 10(-7) J/atom) falls in the range of values reported for submarine hydrothermal systems (0.4-26 x 10(-7) J/atom) whereas the C/He-3 ratio (1.8 x 10(11)) is about two orders of magnitude higher than the MORB average (2 x 10(9)). The mantle He injected from the lake bottom has a fairly short mean residence time in the lake water, and is estimated at about 2-4 years. Overturn of the lake water, which occurs twice a year, probably plays an important role in the rapid transportation of the mantle He from the bottom to the surface.

Large variations are observed with values ranging from less than a tenth to over a hundred times saturation. There is a marked geographical change with median concentrations typically increasing from north (EpCO(2) < 1) to the south (EpCO(2) about 10) as the influence of industrial and urban pollution increases. This is most clearly indicated with median values being strongly and linearly correlated with pollution indicators such as dissolved organic carbon, ammonium, nitrite and (to a lesser degree) soluble reactive phosphorus and nitrate. The distribution of excess partial pressures changes from one of high skew for the cleaner rivers towards a normal distribution for the more polluted rivers. The broad features are explained in terms of the relationship between the biological effects of photosynthesis and respiration across the region. However, the detailed patterns observed are complex for each river: the data scatter is high and there is little relationship for EpCO(2) with the nutrients, flow and temperature. Broadly, the lowest concentrations are observed during the spring to autumn period when the rivers experience the highest algal activity. The majority of the rivers have CO2 concentrations above the atmospheric equilibrium and act as local sources to the atmosphere. Estimates of the rates of degassing of CO2 for one of the rivers, the Swale, show losses generally > 100 mmol/m(2)/day but reaching over 1000 mmol/m(2)/day at times. This loss is compensated for by tributary inputs and in-stream generation such as respiration of labile organic compounds derived from effluents, thus explaining the good correlation between dissolved organic carbon and EpCO(2).

This study combines a three-dimensional numerical thermo-hydrodynamic model with the Omega-vortex identification method to investigate the evolution patterns of hydrodynamics and thermal structures in the Liujiaxia Reservoir (a deep dimictic reservoir in the upper reaches of the Yellow River), under two actual and two projected operation schemes. The results reveal that the phase relationship between water level and velocity exhibits a rope-like temporal variation, controlled by the operation scheme and influenced by upstream inflows. Different schemes impact surface heat accumulation and thermal stratification, where optimised schemes can alleviate stratification intensity. Large-scale vortices influence the distribution of water temperature by elevating the surface water temperature in their central regions during summer and lowering it during winter, while also enhancing the temperature gradient within the thermocline in the vortex-affected areas. Furthermore, the spatiotemporal distribution of vortices is influenced by the operation scheme through its alteration of the backwater effect on the downstream water level. This study elucidates the coupling mechanisms of hydrodynamics and thermal structures under varying schemes, providing insights into optimising reservoir regulation and ecological management strategies.					wang, yuanjian/OEO-3446-2025														1994-2060	1997-003X				DEC 31	2025	19	1							2517313	10.1080/19942060.2025.2517313	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19942060.2025.2517313													WOS:001518334700001

Changes in stratification and iron redox cycle of an acidic pit lake in relation with climatic factors and physical processes	JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION												Nuestra Senora del Carmen (NSC) mine pit located in the northwest of Huelva province in the Iberian Pyrite Belt has been entirely flooded for several decades. The pit lake dimensions are 110 m x 80 m, with a depth of 34 m and a volume of 79,500 m(3). Lake water is acidic (average pH 2.7) with high concentrations of sulfate (8.5 g/L), magnesium (1.0 g/L) and metals (Fe 760 mg/L, Al 230 mg/L, Mn 88 mg/L and Cu 29 mg/L). As with the majority of mining lakes of the Iberian Pyrite Belt, this lake develops chemical stratification (meromictic lake) but unlike the rest, it has occasionally showed circulation throughout the entire water column at the beginning of some winters, displaying total homogenization (holomictic lake). The lake regains chemical stratification during periods of high precipitation due to freshwater runoff contribution from the basin (ectogenic meromixis). Furthermore, another unusual period of mixing was observed in the summer period. Evapoconcentration of the warmer upper layer has been identified as the reason for the chemical destabilization observed in the water column. This work presents the processes (evapoconcentration), parameters (temperature and electric conductivity) and climatic factors (runoff, precipitation and wind) that influence the development of chemical stratification or mixing of the water column in the lake.

The effects of CO2 level and temperature on embryos and free embryos of the Patagonian pejerrey Odontesthes hatcheri (Actinopterygii, Atherinopsidae)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Climate Change includes an increase of both the concentration of atmospheric CO2 and of global temperature. Embryos (= eggs) of Odontesthes hatcheri were collected in spring-summer from the littoral of Lake Morenito (Andes of Argentina). Embryos and free embryos were exposed to different temperatures (within a currently natural thermal range) and CO2 levels (obtained by bubbling lake water with gaseous CO2). High temperature and high CO2 led to low embryonic survival. Embryonic abnormalities were observed. Incidence of colorless blood cells and delayed dorsal pigmentation increased significantly at high CO2 level. Free embryo survival decreased with time, being particularly low at high CO2 level. Free embryo body shape also signaled the effects of high CO2. The combined effect of temperature and CO2 was additive. As temperature and atmospheric pCO(2) increasing continues, the best survival at hatching observed in our experiments (50-60%, pH 7.5, 14 degrees C) will deteriorate (< 20% at 18 degrees C and pH 7.0). These Climate Change-related results and the fact that the species is already threatened by translocated species suggest a fragile situation. Spatial variation of temperature and pCO(2) led us to reconsider the suitability of shallow littoral vegetated areas of the lakes as anti-predatory refuges for fish early life periods.

J	Elzi, L; Villa, E; Patocchi, N				Elzi, Lisa; Villa, Edoardo; Patocchi, Nicola			Correlation between Phragmites australis growth and seasonal lake level variations in Lake Maggiore (Italy/Switzerland): common reed management guidelines	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The present study investigates the impact of water level regulation on the growth of common reed (Phragmites australis), a globally widespread helophytic plant. The investigation has been carried out in the Bolle di Magadino (municipalities of Locarno, Gambarogno, Gordola and Tenero; Ticino, Switzerland), a lacustrine-riparian nature reserve in the context of the Lake Maggiore (that stretches between Italy and Switzerland). This is an oligotrophic, artificially regulated lake. Our initial hypothesis was that variation in water table regulation is the most influential factor for explaining observed local reed dieback. To test this, culm height of P. australis was measured at each significant change in lake water level (water table height increase greater than 20 cm), or monthly in the case of a relatively constant lake level. The study took place between 2020 and 2022, monitoring 14 plots of 400 m(2), placed at three different relative elevation classes with respect to the level of the lake (5 plots at low elevation, <193.475 m; 7 plots at intermediate elevation, 193.476-193.700 m; 2 plots at high elevation, >193.701 m). The results showed that P. australis growth is significantly influenced by the lake water level and thus the relative elevation of the stands, with lower lake levels leading to better growth, especially during the early phases of the growing season. On the other hand, prolonged flooding of shoots significantly impaired common reed growth. The study identifies two relevant relative elevation thresholds for winter mowing, a management practice that enhances reedbeds health. Mowing below 193.20 m elevation is considered risky, as no healthy reedbeds have been observed below this threshold. Mowing below an elevation of 193.50 m was defined as possibly risky, due to observed dieback in some areas as well as healthy reedbeds in other locations at the same or lower elevations. The research also discussed the potential impact of future changes in water level regulation, including the planned change in the spring regulation threshold (+1.50 m above the hydrometric zero in Sesto Calende). This is expected to result in a further rearrangement in lacustrine vegetation, with the growth optimum for P. australis becoming higher and an increase in clumping habit. In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the impact of water level regulation on the growth of P. australis in the Bolle di Magadino nature reserve. The research highlights the need for careful management of water level regulation to preserve the reedbed ecosystem and identifies relevant elevation thresholds for winter mowing to mitigate the risks of reed dieback. The findings can inform future management strategies for the Bolle di Magadino reserve and other similar ecosystems facing the challenges of artificial regulation of water levels.

Investigating the transfer of DIC from karst waters to the atmosphere is important to further our understanding of carbon cycling in karst environments. There is still considerable uncertainty about the controls of DIC transfer in karst waters because of challenges associated with investigations that aim to mimic the continuum of changes in DIC concentrations to equilibrium with atmospheric CO2 in natural settings. Laboratory simulations can create controlled conditions that allow targeted investigations. In this study, four tanks were taken to investigate the variations of pCO(2), DIC and delta C-13(DIC) when karst spring-waters were exposed to the atmosphere from 40 to 360 h as: (1) agitated water containing Hydrilla verticillata; (2) static water containing Hydrilla verticillata; (3) agitated water without Hydrilla verticillata; and (4) static water without Hydrilla verticillata. The rates of photosynthesis/respiration of submerged plants, CO2 outgassing and carbonate precipitation/dissolution were quantified by a time-stepping chemical/isotopic mass balance model. This experiment was designed to create ideal conditions to estimate the temporal evolution of DIC and delta C-13(DIC), and investigate mechanisms that control their evolution when karst spring-waters interact with atmospheric CO2. Results show: (1) generally a steep decrease in DIC concentrations and delta C-13(DIC) enrichment; (2) DIC loss and delta(CDIC)-C-13 enrichment are faster in the agitated waters with submerged plants; (3) DIC evolution is mainly controlled by the metabolism of aquatic plants; (4) carbonate precipitation/dissolution and CO2 outgassing has a lower effect on the DIC evolution in waters with submerged plants; (5) delta C-13(DIC) evolution is mainly controlled by the metabolism of submerged plants; (6) CO2 evasion, photosynthesis and delta C-13(DIC) enrichment are accelerated by the agitation of waters. Our analyses show that more than 40% of the total DIC resulting from carbonate weathering was used for photosynthesis by submerged aquatic plants thereby transforming the DIC into organic carbon (OC), suggesting that intense aquatic photosynthetic activities in continental surface water systems could play an important role as natural carbon sinks.					; Lei, Jiaqi/LSM-1020-2024	Ali, Hendratta/0000-0002-7797-049X; Jiang, Yongjun/0000-0002-9936-698X; Xiao, Qiong/0000-0003-4910-2895; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				APR	2020	583								124294	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124294	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124294													WOS:000527388300009
J	Li, Y; Zhang, CQ; Wang, Y				Li, Yu; Zhang, Chengqi; Wang, Yue			The verification of millennial-scale monsoon water vapor transport channel in northwest China	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Long-term changes of the Asian summer monsoon water vapor transport play a pivotal role in the variability of monsoon precipitation. Paleo-climate simulations have shown that there is an important monsoon vapor transport channel in western China. Previous studies mostly focused on the correlation between monsoon precipitation and intensity. Little research has been done on the verification of the water vapor channel. Compared with speleothem and lacustrine systems, the hydrological cycle of land surface sediments is more directly related to the monsoon water vapor. In this study, we used carbonate delta O-18 and organic matter delta C-13 of the surface eolian sediments from the piedmont of the northern Qilian Mountains to verify the monsoon water vapor on the Holocene millennial-scale. Two surface sedimentary sections were selected to study paleo-monsoon water vapor transport. Proxy data, including carbonate delta O-18 and organic matter delta C-13 of surface eolian sediments, as well as total organic matter and carbonate content were obtained from the two eolian sections. We also synthesized transient simulations of the CCSM3 and the Kiel climate models. The PMIP 3.0 project and TRACE isotopic simulations were also compared with the reconstructed monsoon water vapor transport. Our findings indicate that the strength of the Holocene Asian summer monsoon is consistent with the water vapor transport in western China that has significant impacts to long-term monsoon precipitation in northern China. This study verifies a significant millennial-scale correlation between the monsoon strength and monsoon water vapor transport intensity along the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Schettler, G; Liu, Q; Mingram, J; Negendank, JFW				Schettler, G; Liu, Q; Mingram, J; Negendank, JFW			Palaeovariations in the east-asian monsoon regime geochemically recorded in varved sediments of lake sihailongwan (Northeast China, Jilin Province). Part 1: Hydrological conditions and dust flux	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The varved sediments of the dimictic Lake Sihailongwan (Long Gang mountain area, Jilin Province, Northeast China) represent a palaeoclimatic archive which documents the local precipitation frequency during the summer monsoon, and variations in the aeolian flux of dust with their remote sources in the arid and semi-arid regions of inner Asia. Based on a detailed discussion of sediment genesis in Lake SHL, dust flux rates and palaeohydrological conditions were reconstructed on a decadal scale over the past 220 years. The aeolian influx by dry and wet deposition was quantified and characterised in its chemical composition. Photosynthetic production in the lake is positively correlated with the inflow of nutrient-rich groundwater. The groundwater discharge largely reflects the strength of the summer monsoon. Net accumulation rates for biogenic silica were determined for annually laminated sediments from the centre of the U-shaped lake basin based on sediment data. In a Si-balance model of the modern lake, the depositional flux of biogenic silica could be independently quantified on the base of hydrochemical monitoring data. Comparison of the both estimates allowed to asses the focussing of the particle flux in the lake. Though water retention in Lake SHL is rather high (ca. 30 years), changes in the hydrological conditions are sensitively recorded in the sediments because (i) nutrient-rich groundwater discharges into the productive zone of the lake, (ii) a substantial proportion of the total dissolved Si-inventory of the mixed lake (ca. 30%) is annually consumed by diatom growth, and (3) sediment accumulation is substantially focussed towards the flat bottom of the lake basin. The bulk siliciclastic sediment fraction (ca. 75 wt.%) largely originates from influx of dust of remote provenance. In sediment thin-sections, the dry-deposited dust fraction is microscopically identifiable as seasonal silt layer. Aeolian input by wet-deposition shows a distinctly higher variability than the influx of dust by dry-deposition. As diatom production, wet-deposition of dust is positively correlated with the rainfall during the summer monsoon. The inferred positive correlation between rainfall and dust flux during the summer monsoon implies that dust deposition is determined by the out-wash efficiency of mineral particles for a permanent high atmospheric dust concentration over Northeast China in the last 220 years.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				FEB	2006	35	2					239	270		10.1007/s10933-005-0096-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-005-0096-6													WOS:000234730300002

The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which atmospheric deposition alters the uptake and cycling of S and N in five analogous northern hardwood forests located along one of the most pronounced regional gradients of SO42--S and NO3--N deposition in the United States. We tested the hypothesis that acidic deposition would alter foliar S and N ratios and nutrient cycling in aboveground litter fall. Sulfate in both wet deposition and throughfall increased by a factor of two across the 800-km deposition gradient. The July concentration of S in sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) leaves increased from about 1600 mug.g-1 at the northern research sites to 1800-1900 mug.g-1 at the southern sites. Differences in leaf litter S concentration were even more pronounced (872-1356 mug.g-1), and a clear geographic trend was always apparent in litter S concentration. The 3-year average S content of leaf litter was 63% greater at the southern end of the pollution gradient. Nitrate and total N deposition were also significantly greater at the southern end of the gradient. The concentration of N in both summer foliage and leaf litter was not correlated with N deposition, but the content of N in leaf litter was significantly correlated with N deposition. The molar ratios of S:N in mid-July foliage and leaf litter increased as atmospheric deposition of SO42--S increased. Ratios of S:N were always much greater in leaf litter than in mid-July foliage. The molar ratios of S:N retranslocated from the canopies of these northern hardwood forests were less than those in mid-July foliage or litter fall and showed no geographic trend related to deposition, suggesting that S and N are retranslocated in a relatively fixed proportion. Significant correlations between SO42--S deposition and foliar S concentration, S cycling, and the molar ratio of S:N in foliage suggest that sulfate deposition has altered the uptake and cycling of S in northern hardwood forests of the Great Lakes region.

P.			Tributary Plunging in an Urban Lake (Onondaga Lake): Drivers, Signatures, and Implications1	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												A combination of long-term fixed-frequency and robotic monitoring information for a polluted urban lake, Onondaga Lake, New York, and two of its tributaries is used to resolve the propensity for, and occurrences of, tributary plunging. Cooler temperatures (T) and higher salinity (S) are primarily responsible for the elevated density and plunging of one of these polluted streams for the summer through early fall interval. In-lake transport of this plunging tributary, which receives inputs from combined sewer overflows (CSOs), is tracked by its high S during dry weather, its high turbidity (T-n) with associated lower S (dilution with rainwater) following runoff events, and by its characteristic ionic composition. These signatures are documented extending from the creek mouth, through a connecting navigation channel, through the inflow zone of the lake, and into metalimnetic depths of pelagic portions of the lake. The entry of this polluted tributary below the depth interval(s) of primary production and contact recreation has important implications for the ongoing major rehabilitation program for this lake. The plunging phenomenon diminishes the benefits previously expected for related features of the lake's water quality from ongoing management efforts to abate CSO inputs and reduce nonpoint nutrient loading from the tributary. Previously this tributary tended to instead enter the upper layers of the lake during the operation of an adjoining soda ash manufacturing facility (closure in 1986), as a result of high lake S caused by the industry's ionic waste discharge.

The total PAHs concentrations in sediment and water were 86.7-1790 ngg(-1) dry weight (dw) and 184-365 ng L-1 in summer and 184-3140 ng g(-1) dw and 410-1160 ng L-1 in winter. Two- and 3-ring PAHs were the predominant compounds in water, while PAHs with 4-6 rings dominated in the sediment at both upstream and downstream sites. PAHs concentrations in water and sediment correlated significantly. Diagnostic ratios and positive matrix factorization (PMF) analyses indicated a strong influence of pyrogenic sources, principally biomass combustion and vehicle emission, on the concentrations of PAHs. The distribution, source identification, and mean effects range median quotients (mERMQ) analyses suggested that the most contaminated area was located downstream and upstream of the Wushen Canal, followed by Lake Guchenghu and a commercial crab pond area. From an ecological point of view, PAHs posed a potential risk to drinking water sources as the concentrations exceeded the guideline value of 0.05 mu g L-1. The risk posed by sediment PAHs appeared to be low except for the downstream sites, which showed a low to medium ecotoxicological risk. The total incremental lifetime cancer risks ranged between 10(-7) and 10(-5), indicating a potential health risk for the local population when exposed to sediment from the area.

Lawrence			Timing and Structure of 10.9 and 10.3 ka BP Events Revealed by Annually Laminated Stalagmite Records From Shihua Cave, Northern China	PALEOCEANOGRAPHY AND PALEOCLIMATOLOGY												Studies have shown that East Asia experienced several abrupt centennial-scale weak monsoonal events in the early Holocene. However, the timing and structure of these climate events remain unclear due to the lack of precisely dated and highly resolved records. In this study, we present a well-dated high-resolution East Asia summer monsoon record from 11.32 to 10 ka BP based on two coeval stalagmites, one of which developed clear annual lamina, from Shihua Cave, northern China. Stalagmite 6180 records show 2 weak summer monsoon events at 10.9 and 10.3 ka. The 10.9-ka event occurred from 10.93 to 10.79 ka BP for similar to 140 years and features a "W"-shaped structure. The 10.3-ka event, also known as the ice-rafted debris event 7 in the North Atlantic, lasted similar to 260 years with an asymmetric double-plunging structure. The two events are concurrent with the cold conditions in Greenland ice core record, indicating a close correlation between East Asia summer monsoon and North Atlantic climate. Spectral analyses on Shihua Cave stalagmite delta O-18 time series and annually lamina thickness sequence both show a statistically significant periodicity of 200 years, indicating that anomalous climate events may be triggered by solar activity. The 10.3-ka event also coincides with three small freshwater outbursts in the high-latitude North Atlantic. This agreement suggests that freshwater outbursts may have played a role in reinforcing this weak 10.3-ka event in monsoonal China.

The emptying episode of September 2004 gave the possibility of performing many activities, up to the filling phases which occurred during spring and summer 2005. In situ tests and measurements and laboratory tests lead to a reliable reconstruction of the path of water recharge and draining and to the development of a numerical model of unsaturated-saturated groundwater flow to evaluate natural losses through the lake bed sediments. Results show that material at the bed of the lake has a low permeability and can be responsible for water losses of a few litres per second, very far from the discharge calculated during the rapid drawdown episodes. These results gave the experimental and numerical evidences to support the hypothesis that identifies sudden and temporary failure in the ice floor as the only possible cause of the rapid draining events historically occurred in Miage Lake. In the monitoring period the hydrological balance has also been assessed to evaluate the factors affecting the main recharge phase of the year. Calving was found to be the most important factor contributing to recharge, followed by direct melting and precipitation while water losses occurring through the lake bed sediments and evapotranspiration are much smaller even if not negligible.

J	Rao, YR; Murthy, CR				Rao, YR; Murthy, CR			Coastal boundary layer characteristics during summer stratification in Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY												Simultaneous measurements of Eulerian and Lagrangian currents along the north shore of Lake Ontario are analyzed to provide the mean flow properties and horizontal turbulent exchange characteristics in the coastal boundary layer (CBL). The summer coastal boundary layer is characterized by a frictional boundary layer (FBL) of a width of similar to3 km, in which shore and bottom friction affects the flow. In this regime the currents are predominantly shore parallel and persistent. The outer boundary layer also called an inertial boundary layer (IBL), typically of the order of 5-6 km wide, is a consequence of the adjustment of inertial oscillations to the lateral boundary. During the summer season within the CBL, the current motions are associated with thermocline displacements. The eastward (westward) wind stress causes thermocline elevation (depression) causing upwelling (downwelling). The mean subsurface westward currents associated with downwelling events are typically stronger in comparison to weak eastward flow during upwelling. Further, upwelling events are characterized by reduced low frequency motion (>1 day) and significant near-inertial (similar to 17 h) currents. The width of the CBL decreases during upwelling and increases during downwelling. Internal waves generated by baroclinic seiches during these events have periods from 11 to 17 hours. The near-surface horizontal exchange coefficients calculated from Lagrangian measurements are higher than those from subsurface Eulerian values. Upwelling events show that the turbulent kinetic energy is higher than mean flow kinetic energy (MKE) in the CBL, and cross-shore turbulent exchange increases in the IBL. During downwelling the alongshore exchange coefficients are higher in the FBL, whereas cross-shore exchanges are higher in the IBL. Downwelling events are also characterized by increased contribution from the MKE rather than the turbulent kinetic energy.

Eruptive origins of a lacustrine pyroclastic succession: insights from the middle Huka Falls Formation, Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS												Current and ancestral lakes within the central Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ) provide depocentres for pyroclastic deposits, providing a reliable record of eruption history. These lakes can also be the source of explosive eruptions that directly feed pyroclast-rich density currents. The lithofacies characteristics of pyroclastic deposits allow discrimination between eruption-fed and resedimented facies. The most frequently recognised styles of subaqueous eruptions in the TVZ are shallow-water phreatomagmatic and phreatoplinian eruptions that form subaerial eruption columns. However, deeper source conditions (>150 m water depth) could generate subaqueous explosive eruptions that feed water-supported pyroclast-rich density currents, similar to neptunian eruptions. Such deep-water eruptions have not previously been recognised in the TVZ. Here we study a subsurface deposit, the middle Huka Falls Formation (MHFF), in the Wairakei-Tauhara Geothermal Fields (Wairakei-Tauhara), TVZ, which we interpret to be the product of a relatively deep-water pyroclastic eruption (150-250 m). The largely subsurface Huka Falls Formation records past sedimentary and volcaniclastic deposition in ancient Lake Huka. Deposits examined from eight drill cores reveal a lithic-rich lower unit, a middle volumetrically dominant pumice lapilli-tuff and an upper thinly bedded suspension-settled tuff unit.

The KO eruption has a conservatively estimated tephra volume of 140-170 km(3) making it the largest Holocene eruption in the Kurile-Kamchatka volcanic arc and ranking it among the Earth's largest Holocene explosive eruptions. The eruptive sequence consists of three main units: (1) initial phreatoplinian deposits; (11) plinian fall deposits, and (111) a voluminous and extensive ignimbrite sheet and accompanying surge beds and co-ignimbrite fallout. The KO fall tephra was dispersed over an area of >3 million km(2), mostly in a northwest direction. It is a valuable stratigraphic marker for southern Kamchatka, the Sea of Okhotsk, and a large part of the Asia mainland, where it has been identified as a, similar to6 to 0.1 cm thick layer in terrestrial and lake sediments, 1000-1700 km from source. The ignimbrite, which constitutes a significant volume of the KO deposits, extends to the Sea of Okhotsk and the Pacific Ocean on either side of the peninsula, a distance of over 50 km from source. Fine co-ignimbrite ash was likely formed when the ignimbrite entered the sea and could account for the wide dispersal of the KO fall unit. Individual pumice clasts from the fall and surge deposits range from dacite to rhyolite, whereas pumice and scoria clasts in the ignimbrite range from basaltic andesite to rhyolite. Ignimbrite exposed west and south of the caldera is dominantly rhyolite, whereas north, east and southeast of the caldera it has a strong vertical compositional zonation from rhyolite at the base to basaltic andesite in the middle, and back to rhyolite at the top. Following the KO eruption, lliinsky volcano formed within the northeastern part of the caldera producing basalt to dacite lavas and pyroclastic rocks compositionally related to the KO erupted products. Other post-caldera features include several extrusive domes, which form islands in Kurile Lake, submerged cinder cones and the huge silicic extrusive massif of Dikii Greben' volcano.

The factors which govern the occurrence and seasonal development of such blooms in surface waters are imprecisely understood and little is known about the origins of the bloom-forming populations within particular water bodies. Using 15N as tracer, the appearance of Microcystis in the phytoplankton of an experimental enclosure in the summer of 1977 correlated directly with the presence of particulate 15N which could only have been sediment-derived and which originated mainly from Microcystis cells deposited on the sediment surface the previous year. The most plausible explanation is that Microcystis overwinters on the sediment surface and by so doing provides an inoculum of colonies from which the epilimnetic population develops the following summer. Possible mechanisms which allow the mass recruitment of Microcystis to the plankton are considered elsewhere.

J	Kwak, DH; Jeon, YT; Hur, YD				Kwak, Dong-Heui; Jeon, Young-Tae; Hur, Young Duck			Phosphorus fractionation and release characteristics of sediment in the Saemangeum Reservoir for seasonal change	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH												Periodical algal blooms result in deposition and release of phosphorus (P) from the sediment into the water. Therefore, during seasonal changes when algal particles begin to settle to the bottom, understanding the behavior and distribution characteristics of the P in sediment is the most important key to manage the water quality of the Saemangeum Reservoir. In this study, the variation of water quality and sediment composition including chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and P was investigated to determine the interaction between water and sediment. The study focused primarily on algal particle sedimentation that affects the P release and mineralization of sediment. The Chl-a concentration in water showed a sharp decline in October when the algae began to die in the fall, and afterward the concentration of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total P (TP) in the sediment increased due to the sedimentation of decaying algal particles in November. During the same period of time, the readily bio-available P (RAP) in the sediment showed a drastic increase in the upper region where the Chl-a concentration of water was high. In sequence, the high RAP zone shifted from the upper region to the lower region in the early winter. The RAP shift was considered to be derived from the physical flow of the overlying water from which the decomposing algae settled on the surface of the sediment. The Saemangeum Reservoir was constructed recently; therefore, all the types of inorganic P fractions except soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) that exist on the bottom surface of the lake and the marsh's sediment layer were not sufficient to significantly influence the overlying water. On the other hand, the released P from the algae was distinct and sensitive to the seasonal change. In conclusion, the algal particle sedimentation was important to control eutrophication rather than P release from the mineralized inorganic P of the sediment surface layer in the Seamangeum Reservoir.

Nonlinear multidecadal trends in organic matter dynamics in Midwest reservoirs are a function of variable hydroclimate	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) and particulate organic matter (POM) can influence biogeochemical processes in aquatic systems. An understanding, however, of the source, composition, and processes driving inland reservoir organic matter (OM) cycling at a regional scale over the long term is currently unexplored. Here, we quantify decadal patterns (> 20 yr) of DOM quantity and composition and POM in 40 reservoirs in the midcontinent United States. We built 184 Random Forest models to identify how the relative influence of watershed characteristics and limnological parameters on OM dynamics may vary over time and in synchrony with hydroclimatic anomalies. The reservoir OM quantity and composition varied nonmonotonically through time and in contrast to lake browning observed in the northern hemisphere. Reservoir DOM composition switched from humic and aromatic during wet summers to aliphatic, potentially autochthonous DOM during particularly prolonged dry summers in the mid-2000s. The shift in reservoir DOM quantity and composition could be attributed to the change in time-varying control of watershed and limnological factors mediated by the hydroclimatic conditions. Watershed control (e.g., percent crops) was predominant during wet summers, while the effect of reservoir morphology (e.g., maximum depth) and water quality parameters (e.g., Secchi depth, chlorophyll a) were evident during dry summers. Thus, future predictions of drier conditions may promote "greening" with negative implications for reservoir water quality and treated drinking water. Considering the nonlinear nature of reservoir OM dynamics and its controls will help to better mitigate water quality issues in these constructed systems increasingly impacted by global changes.

J	Bryant, MD				Bryant, M. D.			Global climate change and potential effects on Pacific salmonids in freshwater ecosystems of southeast Alaska	CLIMATIC CHANGE												General circulation models predict increases in air temperatures from 1A degrees C to 5A degrees C as atmospheric CO2 continues to rise during the next 100 years. Thermal regimes in freshwater ecosystems will change as air temperatures increase regionally. As air temperatures increase, the distribution and intensity of precipitation will change which will in turn alter freshwater hydrology. Low elevation floodplains and wetlands will flood as continental ice sheets melt, increasing sea-levels. Although anadromous salmonids exist over a wide range of climatic conditions along the Pacific coast, individual stocks have adapted life history strategies-time of emergence, run timing, and residence time in freshwater-that are often unique to regions and watersheds. The response of anadromous salmonids will differ among species depending on their life cycle in freshwater. For pink and chum salmon that migrate to the ocean shortly after they emerge from the gravel, higher temperatures during spawning and incubation may result in earlier entry into the ocean when food resources are low. Shifts in thermal regimes in lakes will change trophic conditions that will affect juvenile sockeye salmon growth and survival. Decreased summer stream flows and higher water temperatures will affect growth and survival of juvenile coho salmon. Rising sea-levels will inundate low elevation spawning areas for pink salmon and floodplain rearing habitats for juvenile coho salmon. Rapid changes in climatic conditions may not extirpate anadromous salmonids in the region, but they will impose greater stress on many stocks that are adapted to present climatic conditions. Survival of sustainable populations will depend on the existing genetic diversity within and among stocks, conservative harvest management, and habitat conservation.																			0165-0009	1573-1480				JUL	2009	95	1-2					169	193		10.1007/s10584-008-9530-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-008-9530-x													WOS:000267365400011

In particular, a distinctive pattern is exhibited by salt-succulent species in the Amaranthaceae wherein Allenrolfea occidentalis occurs in monospecific stands at the highest topographic position in the playa, Sarcocornia utahensis occurs in monospecific stands in the middle position, and Salicornia rubra occurs in monospecific stands at the lowest topographic position. Because salt playas feature a shallow, temporary winter lake that recedes as it evaporates throughout the summer and because vegetation zones closely follow the contours of the temporary lake, we hypothesized that factors relating to the hydrology of the system could be used to predict vegetation zonation. Indeed, we found multiple environmental gradients associated with hydrology that could contribute to the topographical zonation of the 3 plant species, including gradients in soil salinity, pH, redox potential, and water content, but not soil texture. A multinomial logistic regression model incorporating soil pH, redox potential, and water content was able to predict the correct vegetation zone with 100% accuracy. Surprisingly, the gradient in soil NaCl concentration did not contribute significantly to the regression model. These results suggest that soil pH, redox potential, and water content are factors that could be further explored as niche axes that distinguish members of salt playa vegetation.

J	Özler, HM				Ozler, Halil Murat			Carbonate weathering and connate seawater influencing karst groundwaters in the Gevas-Gurpinar-Guzelsu basins, Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												There are 59 springs at the Gevas-GurpA +/- nar-Guzelsu basins, 38 of these springs emerge from the fractured karst aquifers (recrystallized limestone and travertine) and 21 emerge from the Yuksekova ophiolites, KA +/- rkge double dagger it formation and alluvium. The groundwater samples collected from 38 out of the total of 59 springs, two streams, one lake and 12 wells were analyzed physico-chemically in the year 2002. EC and TDS values of groundwater increased from the marble (high altitude) to the ophiolites and alluvium (toward Lake Van) as a result of carbonate dissolution and connate seawater. Five chemical types of groundwater are identified: Ca-Mg-HCO(3), Mg-Ca-HCO(3), Mg-Na-HCO(3), Na-Ca-HCO(3) and Mg-Ca-Na-HCO(3). The calculations and hydrochemical interpretations show that the high concentrations of Ca(2+), Mg(2+) and HCO(3) (-) as predominant ions in the waters are mainly attributed to carbonate rocks and high pCO(2) in soil. Most of the karst springs are oversaturated in calcite, aragonite and dolomite and undersaturated in gypsum, halite and anhydrite. The water-rock interaction processes that singly or in combination influence the chemical composition of each water type include dissolution of carbonate (calcite and dolomite), calcite precipitation, cation exchange and freshening of connate seawater. These processes contribute considerably to the concentration of major ions in the groundwater. Stable isotope contents of the groundwater suggest mainly direct integrative recharge.																			1866-6280					JUL	2010	61	2					323	340		10.1007/s12665-009-0345-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-009-0345-5													WOS:000279080600009

Mixing-driven changes in distributions and abundances of planktonic microorganisms in a large, oligotrophic lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Temperate lakes experience variation in mixing and stratification that affects the distributions, activities, abundances, and diversity of plankton communities. We examined temporal and vertical changes in the composition of planktonic microorganisms (including Bacteria and Archaea) in oligotrophic Flathead Lake, Montana. Using a combination of approaches that included 16S rRNA gene sequencing and flow cytometric determination of cell abundances, we found that the microbial community was responsive to variations in stratification and mixing at time scales ranging from episodic (scale of days) to seasonal. However, the impact of such physical dynamics varied among taxa, likely reflecting taxa-specific responses to environmental changes that coincide with stratification and mixing (e.g., light availability and nutrient supply). During the early spring, periods of relatively short-term (< 7 d) intermittency in stratification and mixing influenced the vertical distributions of specific microbial taxa, notably including the cyanobacteria. These events highlight time scales of biological responses to high-frequency variations associated with lake stratification and mixing, particularly during the transition to the growing season in the early spring.					; Wear, Emma/L-1525-2013	Church, Matthew/0000-0002-6166-8579; Ranieri, John/0000-0003-0363-5119; Wear, Emma/0000-0002-4811-5363; Evans, Kate/0000-0002-5336-9632													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2024	69	3					604	620		10.1002/lno.12509	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.12509		JAN 2024											WOS:001145106800001
J	Danielescu, S; Barbecot, F; Morand, V				Danielescu, Serban; Barbecot, Florent; Morand, Victor			Groundwater contributions to surface water in the Assiniboine Delta Aquifer (ADA): A water quantity and quality perspective	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In the Lake Winnipeg Basin (LWB), at both basin and regional scales, there are currently gaps regarding the significance of groundwater as a mediator of nutrient and contaminant fluxes to Lake Winnipeg. During 2018, surface water and groundwater samples were collected from various locations across the largest sand and gravel aquifer (Assiniboine Delta Aquifer [ADA]; 3800 km(2)) in the LWB as well as from surface water courses flowing above this aquifer. The samples collected during spring and fall were analyzed for anions and cations as well as for a series of isotopic and geochemical tracers (e.g. water isotopes, carbon 14, artificial sweeteners, pesticides, etc.). The results reveal that groundwater and the small watercourses flowing above the ADA have a similar chemical composition, which is in contrast with the chemical composition of the main watercourse flowing above the aquifer (Assiniboine River [AR]). When corroborated with stream discharge measurements this indicates that groundwater plays a significant role at local scale in controlling both the flow and the chemical composition of the AR tributaries. Nitrate showed low to non-detectable concentrations in both groundwater and surface water. With respect to groundwater, this could be related to the reducing conditions in the deeper aquifer in conjunction with relatively large groundwater travel times of up to 2400 years.

It plays a meaningful role in inland and coastal biogeochemical processes and aids in determining water quality. Four data-gathering expeditions were conducted in Lake Hongze (HZL), China, between 2015 and 2017. Based on the in situ optical and biological data, we constructed and evaluated a band ratio model for retrieving K-d (490) of HZL from MODIS/Aqua images between 2002 and 2016. Our results are as follows: (1) The developed algorithm, using the visible bands (R-rs (red)/R-rs(green)), performs robustly for K-d (490) estimation, with R-2 of 0.82 and p < 0.0001 for the modeling data. By validating with the in situ observed data, the mean absolute percentage error is determined to be 17.82%, and the root means square error is 1.52 m(-1). (2) The spatial distribution of K-d (490) strong relates with the input river that formed a cone-shaped distribution with the vertex at Huai River Estuary, decreasing from the southeast (RC) to the northern (NE) and western bays in HZL. The largest K d (490) value is in RC, with 7.10 +/- 3.03 m(-1), followed by NE and WL (wetland) with values of 6.10 +/- 2.58 m(-1) and 5.32 +/- 2.09 m(-1), respectively. (3) K-d (490) reaches high values in winter and low values in the summer although the variance is quite different in different lake areas. The seasonal distribution of K-d (490) in HZL is driven by the runoff produced by precipitation. (4) K-d (490) decreased systematically as the East Asian monsoon weakened from 2002 to 2012 that means wind has great influence on K-d (490) variation from year scale. However, human activity like sand-mining disrupted this trend, leading to the rise of K-d (490) during 2012 and 2016.

J	Koutaniemi, L				Koutaniemi, L			Twenty-one years of string movements on the Liippasuo aapa mire, Finland	BOREAS												The movements of four 80-100 m long strings crossing a 750 m long aapa mire were measured, and two pools were drained and local snow depth and ground frost conditions were observed in order to test the role of water pressure and ground frost in string motions. Located close to the Arctic Circle, Liippasuo is characterized by a maximal snow depth of about 1 m, a mean annual temperature of -1 degrees C and a maximal variation in temperature of over 75 degrees C. The strings moved at the rate of 50-150 cm in the course of 21 years. The most active parts were those located in the area of steepest gradient. Periods with normal annual shifts in the range 2-5 cm were interrupted from time to time by moves of abnormally high magnitude. This resulted in swelling of the nearby pools and increased curving of the strings, giving rise to a small-scale zigzag course in the strings. The principal factors responsible for the motion were ice/frozen peat push, solifluction and water pressure. Movements occurred not only during the thawing period but also in summer-time. They were as common in the direction of the contours as when following the slope. The unexpected uphill direction of movements is explained by winter-time freezing and expansion of the whole mire, in the same way as the ice cover on a lake will expand as a result of temperature changes.																			0300-9483	1502-3885				DEC	1999	28	4					521	530		10.1080/030094899422019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030094899422019													WOS:000084336000007

Minor shifts towards more natural conditions in captivity improve long-term survival among reintroduced Atlantic salmon	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Elevating winter water temperatures is a common practice when rearing salmonids for supplementation or reintroduction. Doing so elevates developmental rates, producing larger juveniles with greater smolt-to-adult survival, but does not guarantee improved adult returns to stocked tributaries. To test whether more natural developmental conditions improve adult returns to stocked tributaries, three consecutive cohorts of yearling (age 1+) landlocked Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were released into two tributaries of Lake Champlain. Cohorts were reared under two winter thermal conditions (seasonal surface water and above-seasonal groundwater) and (or) two release times (early and normal). Relative to standard hatchery practices, modelled returns to experimental tributaries increased over replicate cohorts by 286% on average following exposure to seasonal rearing temperatures, but decreased by 89% on average when release dates were advanced. By utilizing cost-effective shifts towards hatchery rearing techniques that more closely resemble natural growth conditions, we demonstrate how hatchery programs may improve long-term survival and returns for fish species with complex life histories involved in supplementation and reintroduction programs.

Carbonates in the Calciaquoll accumulated from groundwater additions. Soil water monitoring during a year with near-normal rainfall and temperatures showed that an upward soil water flux existed during a 13-wk period from late spring through midsummer. Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (UHC) values indicated that the 2BC horizon controlled upward water flux in this soil. Upward water movement through this horizon during the 14-wk period was estimated to be 36 mm. In late summer, evapotranspirative demand far exceeded the UHC of the horizon. As the soil dried, UHC values were further reduced. Assuming time of soil formation of 4000 to 9000 yr and detrital carbonate mineral levels of 10 to 15% by weight, annual additions of calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE) to the calcic horizon range from 0.1 to 0.2 mol m-2 yr-1 in this soil based on the amount of carbonate in the calcic horizon. Annual average levels of CCE in rising groundwater must be between 2.6 and 8.2 mmol kg-1 for the observed amount of carbonate to accumulate. The current amount of CCE in calcic horizon soil solution, as estimated by mathematically concentrating saturation past soluble ions to the observed constant water content, was 3.5 mmol kg-1, a value within the range estimated.																			0361-5995	1435-0661				MAR-APR	1989	53	2					495	499		10.2136/sssaj1989.03615995005300020032x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1989.03615995005300020032x													WOS:A1989U575900032

An alternative strategy is to enrich such microorganisms in their native environment by allowing them to exchange electrons with polarized solid electrodes. The use of this approach is currently limited because of a lack of available tools. We developed a low-cost, battery-operated potentiostat that is capable of controlling the potential of a working electrode and can be deployed and operated remotely, allowing the enrichment of microorganisms on electrodes in their native environment. The device was tested in four alkaline hot springs in Heart Lake Geyser Basin in Yellowstone National Park (with a temperature ranging from 45 degrees C to 91 degrees C and a relatively constant pH of 8.5-8.7). Microbial community analysis showed a change in microbial community structure after 32 days of polarization. The impact of polarization on microbial community was most substantial on the electrodes that generated the highest cathodic and anodic currents, suggesting a direct impact of polarization on electrode microbial community.

Eutrophic waters, such as Lake Taihu, historically has been suffered from cyanobacterial (Microcystis spp.) blooms, exhibiting heightened sensitivity to climate change. Nevertheless, the quantitative responses of this highly productive lake to future warming remains poorly predicted. This study employes a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model coupling a lake thermal model and cyanobacterial biomass model to project future water temperatures and associated phytoplankton biomass in Lake Taihu under multiple Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), comparing scenarios for 2100 against current conditions (2015-2022 multi-year average). Results indicate that annual mean Lake Water Column Temperature (LWCT) will rise by 1.12 degrees C, 2.15 degrees C, 4.18 degrees C, and 4.97 degrees C under respective SSP scenarios, which is much higher than the global average increase of inland waters. The most pronounced warming occurs during autumn, while winter thermal stratification stability is projected to decline (vertical temperature deviation approach zero). Algal bloom intensity (by chlorophyll-a concentration) is projected to increase by 12.0%, 22.2%, 46.2% and 62.5%, indicating that climate warming may trigger extensive and severe blooms in highly productive waters. Sensitivity analyses reveal that a 40% nutrient reduction effectively controls cyanobacterial concentrations during 2060-2090 in all but the warmest scenario. These findings demonstrate that targeted nutrient mitigation can counteract the amplifying effects of climate warming on cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic waters.					; Liu, Zhao/B-2189-2012	Qin, Boqiang/0000-0003-3977-4903; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				NOV	2025	661		B						133716	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.133716	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.133716													WOS:001519170200005
J	Hatch, LK				Hatch, LK			Factors affecting Iowa lake and reservoir water quality	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												lowalake and reservoir water quality data collected during the summers of 1990 and 1992 were analyzed according to origin (lake vs. reservoir) and location, updating previous synoptic surveys. Morphometric comparisons between Iowa regions indicate unique characteristics for reservoirs, glacial lakes, oxbow lakes, and waterbodies on the Des Moines glacial lobe. All Iowa takes and reservoirs are eutrophic although there is a significant range of water quality and within region variability. Parameters such as chlorophyll a, total phosphorus (TP), and total nitrogen (TN) summer mean concentrations were highest on the Des Moines glacial lobe (means of 64 mug . L-1, 164 mug . L-1, and 4.4 mg.L-1, respectively). A comparison of northern Iowa versus southern Minnesota lakes and southern Iowa versus northern Missouri reservoirs indicated that Iowa water quality is more eutrophic in both instances. Northern Iowa lakes had higher TN (3.0 mg . L-1), total suspended solids (TSS, 39 mg . L-1), and non-volatile suspended solids (NVSS, 18 mg . L-1) summer mean concentrations than southern Minnesota lakes (2.1 mg . L, 14 mg . L-1, and 3 mg . L-1, respectively). Southern Iowa reservoirs had higher TP (149 mug . L-1), TN (1.8 mg .

J	Toetz, D				Toetz, Dale			Nitrate in ground and surface waters in the vicinity of a concentrated animal feeding operation	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Non-point source pollution by nitrates (NO3) from fertilizers and animal wastes has potential effects on human health and eutrophication of surface waters. Until now one problem in determining sources of NO3 has been the difficulty of identifying origin. Stable isotopes of nitrogen can be used as a signature of NO3 to identify origin from animal wastes. NO3 derived from animal waste has a delta(15) N signature of +10 +20 parts per thousand, which is uniquely high compared to delta(NO3)-N-15 from other sources. The purpose of this research was to describe the distribution of delta(NO3)-N-15, NO3 and Cl in wells, springs, seeps and lakes in the vicinity of a concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO), which was the suspected source of contamination. Nitrate concentrations and delta(NO3)-N-15 were higher in wells just below the waste spray area of the CAFO than above it. Chloride ion concentrations in wells confirmed a contaminated area below the waste spray area. Surface water samples had a wide range of NO3 concentrations and were uncontaminated, except for samples from one seep and one spring. However, the mean delta(NO3)-N-15 in samples from springs were +3.9 to +5.0 parts per thousand, values that are in a range reported for soil NO3. Thus, although data are not available on groundwater movement, both stable isotope signatures and chloride concentrations indicate that animal wastes were the source of NO3 contamination.																			0003-9136					MAY	2006	166	1					67	77		10.1127/0003-9136/2006/0166-0067	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2006/0166-0067													WOS:000238757500004

Carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionation under continuous light: implications for paleoenvironmental interpretations of the High Arctic during Paleogene warming	OECOLOGIA												The effect of low intensity continuous light, e.g., in the High Arctic summer, on plant carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionations is unknown. We conducted greenhouse experiments to test the impact of light quantity and duration on both carbon and hydrogen isotope compositions of three deciduous conifers whose fossil counterparts were components of Paleogene Arctic floras: Metasequoia glyptostroboides, Taxodium distichum, and Larix laricina. We found that plant leaf bulk carbon isotopic values of the examined species were 1.75-4.63aEuro degrees more negative under continuous light (CL) than under diurnal light (DL). Hydrogen isotope values of leaf n-alkanes under continuous light conditions revealed a D-enriched hydrogen isotope composition of up to 40aEuro degrees higher than in diurnal light conditions. The isotope offsets between the two light regimes is explained by a higher ratio of intercellular to atmospheric CO2 concentration (C (i)/C (a)) and more water loss for plants under continuous light conditions during a 24-h transpiration cycle. Apparent hydrogen isotope fractionations between source water and individual lipids (epsilon(lipid-water)) range from -62aEuro degrees (Metasequoia C-27 and C-29) to -87aEuro degrees (Larix C-29) in leaves under continuous light. We applied these hydrogen fractionation factors to hydrogen isotope compositions of in situ n-alkanes from well-preserved Paleogene deciduous conifer fossils from the Arctic region to estimate the delta D value in ancient precipitation. Precipitation in the summer growing season yielded a delta D of -186aEuro degrees for late Paleocene, -157aEuro degrees for early middle Eocene, and -182aEuro degrees for late middle Eocene. We propose that high-latitude summer precipitation in this region was supplemented by moisture derived from regionally recycled transpiration of the polar forests that grew during the Paleogene warming.					; Pagani, Mark/B-3233-2008	LePage, Ben/0000-0003-3155-7373; 													0029-8549	1432-1939				JUN	2009	160	3					461	470		10.1007/s00442-009-1321-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-009-1321-1								19352720					WOS:000266010800006

Also, a new interpolation procedure is developed and used jointly with the advanced bio-optical and standard window-split algorithms to generate from SeaWiFS and AVHRR data the time series of spatial and temporal (seasonal and interannual) variations of chl, sm, doc and water surface temperature (T-S) for the period 1998-2004 in Lake Ladoga, the largest European fresh water body. Obtained for the first time, the spaceborne fields of the above variables have revealed at an unprecedented time and space resolution some intrinsic features and interdependence of thermal and biogeochemical processes in the lake. Rates of thermobar displacement from the littoral zone to the central deep water area are quantified during periods of lake warming and cooling. From spring to mid-summer, the dynamics of phytoplankton biomass spatial distribution are evidenced to follow the retraction of the cold water zone bordered by the thermobar. Importantly, along with the thermobar dynamics, the zones of the most enhanced phytoplankton concentration are concurrently governed by the lake bathymetry, and thus gradually move from south to north along the eastern coast line. Brought with fluvial input, suspended minerals and allochthonous dissolved organics are not only restricted to the zones of major river deltas but also driven northward by coastal cyclonic currents prevailing in Lake Ladoga. The obtained space data allows the interplay of the above factors to be explicitly revealed and explains the observed interannual variations in the surficial expressions of biogeochemical processes inherent in Lake Ladoga.

The study, based on numerical simulations and field data, focuses on two different campaigns: the first in autumn 2006, when the stratification was weak and there was a mild prevailing northeasterly wind, and the second in autumn 2013, when the stratification was strong and there was a mild easterly wind. Between these two campaigns, the sea surface level decreased by 3.2 m. The periods of the fundamental modes were identified as 36 and 14 h, respectively. In both years, either second or third vertical modes were found. In general, the vertical modes in 2013 were higher because of the broad and strong pycnocline. For both years, it was found that the deep quasi-homogeneous mixed upper layer could sustain internal waves under mild wind conditions. The observed first and second vertical modes in 2006 are the first and second horizontal modes and the second and third vertical modes in 2013 are the second and third horizontal modes. The results suggest that, due to sea level variations, the neck connecting the Chernyshev Bay to the main body of the lake can become a critical location for the development of a nodal line for all principal oscillation modes. Rotation effects on waves were not analyzed in this study.

Diel flow pulses drive particulate organic matter transport from microbial mats in a glacial meltwater stream in the McMurdo Dry Valleys	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Many glacial meltwater streams in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV) of Antarctica contain abundant microbial mats, representing hot spots of primary production in a barren landscape. These mats persist through the winter in a freeze-dried state and grow in the summer, experiencing a dynamic hydrologic regime as streamflow varies on a diel cycle and with weather conditions. During diel peaks in flow these streams transport particulate organic matter (POM) to the downstream closed-basin lakes. We investigated the spatial and temporal dynamics of POM transport derived from the scouring of microbial mats in Von Guerard Stream of the MDV. The results show clockwise hysteresis effects in POM concentration over diel flood pulses and suggests that POM transport in the MDVs is supply limited. Further studies are required to confirm this and to identify the potential contributing sources of POM. The hysteresis effect was modeled using an approach derived from models of sediment transport in streams. Spatial variations in POM transport indicate that patch-scale variations in bed shear stress and benthic biomass also influence transport which is integrated downstream over several 100's of meters. Large variations in the POM transport dynamics between different diel flood pulses were found to be related to the time since a resetting flood event and the regrowth of potentially mobile benthic biomass, providing further evidence of the importance of supply limitation and flow variability in controlling the organic matter flux of stream ecosystems.

Oxygen isotopes from both species show identical values and track the general North Atlantic and European temperature history since deglaciation in great detail. Values of ostracode 8180 values suggest that about 16 cal ka the average annual air temperatures were about 11 degrees C colder than today. Carbon isotopic values from both species of ostracodes are similar during the Lateglacial and early Holocene, and show an overall decrease from -4 parts per thousand to -7 parts per thousand that is probably related to an increase in photosynthetic productivity in the water column, as suggested by an increase in organic carbon, delivering C-13-depleted organic matter to the bottom waters (carbon pump). About 9 cal ka only L mirabilis delta C-13 values decreased about -2.5 parts per thousand within 300 years. Higher delta C-13 variability and ecological evidence suggests that L mirabilis represents a summer signal, whereas L sanctipatricii displays a more subdued annual average. After about 7 cal ka another -1.5% decrease for both species, accompanied by an increase in magnetic susceptibility, a decrease in carbonate content, and more positive bulk carbonate isotope values followed, suggesting higher detrital-clastic input into the lake. In order to provide a possible mechanism explaining the negative L mirabilis delta C-13-values, sediment pore water profiles of O-2 and CH4 in short cores collected from sites distal to proximal to the Alpine Rhine River delta, were inspected. Sediments in cores from more proximal sites to the Rhine delta become anoxic at shallower sediment depth due to the decay of high allochthonous organic carbon input to the sediment, which greatly increases concentrations of methane in pore waters closer to the Rhine inflow. When methane is oxidized close to the sediment-water-interface, C-13-depleted carbon is added to pore water DIC that is then available for incorporation into ostracode shells. This mechanism suggests that about 9 cal ka the oxygen supply to the bottom waters, especially in summer, decreased. This stimulated methanogenesis close to the sediment-water-interface, and provided delta C-13-depleted carbon to benthic dwellers. Independent evidence for methanogenesis is provided by the increase in concentration of tetrahymanol after about 9 cal ka coincident with the decrease in delta C-13 of L mirabilis. We suggest that about 9 cal ka the northward retreat of the Northern Hemisphere Ice Sheets, and consequently the polar front, left the alpine region affected by a more oceanic climate, characterized by warmer winters as they occur today especially during the positive North Atlantic Oscillation Index phase. More frequently incomplete mixing of the water column may have shifted the decay of organic matter faster to anaerobic conditions in surficial sediments especially during summer. By about 7 cal ka the North Atlantic region had probably warmed sufficiently to increase precipitation in Central Europe and consequently detrital-clastic runoff to lake Constance.

Contrasting effects of nutrients and climate on algal communities in two lakes in the Windermere catchment since the late 19th century	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Disentangling the role of nutrient pollution and climate change on lake ecosystem functioning is paramount to protect water quality in lake catchments worldwide. For more effective management, however, we need to determine whether these two forcing factors interact at different spatial and temporal scales. This study compares centennial-scale archival data and lake sediment records of eutrophication from Blelham Tarn and previously published data from Lake Windermere's North Basin in the English Lake District. We aimed to quantify how lake morphometry, catchment characteristics and landscape position influence the relationship between climate, local land use and algal community change. Redundancy analysis revealed that increases in cyanobacterial pigments and stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon in sediments of Blelham Tarn from the 1970s onwards correlate strongly with rising densities of sheep and cattle in the catchment. Concomitant installation of piped water and sewage processing facilities appeared to lead to the expansion of filamentous cyanobacteria. In contrast, elevated fossil pigments from siliceous algae after 1990 were related inversely to winter precipitation, suggesting seasonal changes in hydraulic flushing also influenced the algal community response to centennial-scale fertilisation. Abundance of vernal algae increased synchronously in Blelham Tarn and Lake Windermere's North Basin after regional agricultural intensification in the mid-nineteenth century. In contrast, differences in timing of wastewater disposal and treatment at each site led to asynchronous changes in summer taxa such as filamentous cyanobacteria. This study highlights that lake catchments can act as local filters to regional climate change, both due to differences in localised land-use and intrinsic hydrological features (e.g. catchment:lake area, flushing rate). Further, this paper highlights the ability of palaeolimnology to aid identification of significant nutrient sources over different spatial scales for effective catchment water management. 10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2427					; Barker, Philip/J-5938-2012; McGowan, Suzanne/GZB-0118-2022; Moorhouse, Heather/NJR-9693-2025; Jones, Matthew/JXM-5303-2024; Leavitt, Peter/A-1048-2013	Barker, Philip/0000-0002-5334-9201; Jones, Matthew/0000-0001-8116-5568; Leavitt, Peter/0000-0001-9805-9307													0046-5070	1365-2427				DEC	2014	59	12					2605	2620		10.1111/fwb.12457	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12457													WOS:000344778800013

Air and water samples were collected between March and August 2017 (autumn-winter) and analyzed for concentrations of OCPs (alpha-HCH, beta-HCH, gamma-HCH and HCB) and PCBs (PCB-28,-52,-101,-118,-153,-158,-180) using gas chromatography coupled with an electron capture detector. The direction of air-water exchange direction was evaluated using a fugacity approach (f(w) f(a)(-1)), and net diffusive exchange fluxes (F-AW, ng m(-2) d(-1)) were also estimated. Total Sigma 4OCP levels in air ranged from 0.31 to 37 pg m(-3), with a maximum for beta-HCH, while Sigma 7PCB levels ranged from 3.05 to 43 pg m(-3). The most abundant congener was PCB-153, accounting for 60% of the total PCBs in air. Surface water Sigma(4)OCPs measured in this study ranged from 1.01 to 3.9 pg L-1, with gamma-HCH predominating, while surface water Sigma 7PCB levels ranged from 0.32 to 24 pg L-1, with PCB-101, PCB-118, and PCB-153 presenting the highest levels. Diffusive air-water exchanges of HCB, alpha-HCH, gamma-HCH and PCBs in the form of volatilization from the lake to air predominated; in contrast, for beta-HCH net deposition dominated during the sampling period. Estimates suggested faster microbial degradation in the dissolved phase compared to atmospheric degradation for all analyzed POPs. Overall, these results could indicate that the oligotrophic lakes of northern Patagonia act as a secondary source of atmospheric POPs, mainly PCBs and some OCPs. This study is a first attempt to understand the occurrence of POPs in air and water, as well as their dynamics in oligotrophic lakes in the southern hemisphere.					; Tucca, Felipe/J-9628-2015; Galbán-Malagón, Cristóbal/ABU-7252-2022; NIMPTSCH, JORGE/O-4030-2018; Dachs, Jordi/LOU-0520-2024; Casas, Gemma/JYP-3405-2024; Pozo, Karla/D-3822-2012; Nimptsch, Jorge/B-8638-2008; Barra, Ricardo/A-5543-2009; Galban Malagon, Cristobal/J-2384-2015; Chiang, Gustavo/ABA-9349-2020	Tucca Diaz, Felipe/0000-0002-1692-8116; Pozo, Karla/0000-0001-7747-7518; Gemma, Casas/0000-0002-4197-2151; Chiang, Gustavo/0000-0003-4504-355X; Nimptsch, Jorge/0000-0001-5419-7361; Woelfl, Stefan/0000-0001-5580-2383; Dachs, Jordi/0000-0002-4237-169X; Galban Malagon, Cristobal/0000-0001-8397-5804; 													0013-9351	1096-0953				MAR	2022	204		B						112042	10.1016/j.envres.2021.112042	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.112042		SEP 2021						34555404					WOS:000704705800001

Hydrological variability, zooplankton availability and the shift between planktivore-benthivore feeding behaviour in the visual predator fish, Odontesthes bonariensis	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Hydrology is a key factor in the dynamic of zooplankton community in lakes with high water renewal rate. Crustaceans' zooplankton biomass can sharply decline during flooding periods as consequence of wash-out effect. The hydrologically induced changes in zooplankton community may certainly affect the feeding behaviour of planktivorous fishes, but this has not been studied yet. The inland silverside, Odontesthes bonariensis (Valenciennes, 1835), is the main visual planktivorous fish in temperate shallow lakes of South America. We analyzed the diet composition and feeding strategy of O. bonariensis in a large run-of-the-river shallow lake, along two consecutive spring-summer periods with contrasting hydrological conditions. Water residence time varied one order of magnitude between flood and drought period. As it was expected, silversides showed size selective feeding on large cladocerans during drought period when zooplankton biomass was high. On the other hand, during high flushing period, zooplankton abundance decreased noticeable and silversides drastically changes its feeding behaviour from visual planktivore to benthivore. The analysis of the feeding strategy of O. bonariensis showed that this species largely behaves as a specialist irrespective of the hydrological conditions. However, the main involved prey varied from large Daphnia during low flow conditions to large Ostracoda during floods. Our study reveals that the variation in the availability of suitable prey induced by hydrological variability is associated with a drastic change in feeding grounds and prey selection of O. bonariensis. This flexible predatory behaviour may have consequences on food web dynamics of shallow lakes that are further discussed.

J	Ekblom, A; Stabell, B				Ekblom, Anneli; Stabell, Bjorg			Paleohydrology of Lake Nhaucati (southern Mozambique), ∼400 AD to present	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												This paper investigates the correlations between lake level change, rainfall variability and general atmospheric forcing in southern Africa. The analysis of fossil diatom assemblages in a sediment sequence from the small, rain-fed Lake Nhaucati, southern Mozambique, is presented and discussed in relation to regional palaeoclimate data. The accumulation of organic sediments in Lake Nhaucati began 1,600 years ago when the lake level was rising. Lithology and pollen suggest a low stand at 800 AD, which correlates with other climate proxies from the summer rainfall region of southern Africa. The diatom assemblage suggests that lake levels were high between 900 and 1300 AD, with shorter low stands at c.1100 and 1200 AD. The period after 1400 AD was marked by a slow rate of accumulation and consequently a low temporal resolution. The correlation with other climate proxies in the summer rainfall region, written sources, and pollen data suggests repeated droughts corresponding to the Little Ice Age, though the driest periods may have caused complete desiccation of the lake. Higher lake levels are suggested after 1800 AD, though written sources suggest droughts in the beginning of the twentieth century. The analysis shows a good correlation with palaeoclimate data from the summer rainfall region and confirms the presence of an anti-phase relationship between the summer rainfall region of southern Africa and the bi-modal rainfall region of east tropical Africa. It also supports the general hypothesis that variation in the intensity of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone is the main agent modulating rainfall over southern and eastern Africa on centennial timescales.

Seventy-seven were retrieved from emergence traps, six from pan traps and 40 were collected with sweep net and/or aspirator. They contained 420 dolichopodid flies that belonged to 64 species in 22 genera. Four species, Campsicnemus umbripennis, Hercostomus chetifer, Liancalus virens and Syntormon pallipes, accounted for over half of the yields. Contrary to most species that were found in largest numbers in rivers, and their beds in particular, S. pallipes and Hercostomus gracilis were considerably more abundant at springs. Fifty-five species could be added to the national checklist which raises the total number to 94 species. All species records are given, the habitat of each species is described, if possible, and taxonomic notes are provided for some dubious species. Finally, elements are presented to support the assumption that the extant dolichopodid species richness of Croatia is at least three- to fourfold of the current number.					; Ivković, Marija/AAB-1756-2020	Ivkovic, Marija/0000-0003-3188-5676; 													1175-5326	1175-5334				AUG 3	2018	4455	3					401	428		10.11646/zootaxa.4455.3.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.11646/zootaxa.4455.3.1								30314191					WOS:000441334600001

Nitrate uptake was highest during midsummer when the concentration of chlorophyll a was highest, and inorganic N was low. The algal flora was dominated by diatoms during early and late summer and by flagellates during midsummer. Highest rates of NO3- uptake occurred when flagellates were relatively more abundant than diatoms. Nitrate uptake occurred at relatively low irradiances. Inhibition of NO3- and NH4+ uptake was observed. Ks [Michaelis-Menten half saturation constant] for NO3- uptake was 3.27 .mu.moles/l. The seasonal pattern of NO3- uptake was discussed relative to results of other studies. Flagellates, diatoms and other algae make major use of NO3-, but blue-green algae do not.																			0003-9136						1977	79	2					182	192																WOS:A1977CZ75900003

Isotopic seasonality of fluvial-derived greenhouse gases implies active layer deepening	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Climate change in the northern circumpolar regions is rapidly thawing organic-rich permafrost soils, leading to the substantial release of dissolved CO2 and CH4 into river systems. This mobilization impacts local ecosystems and regional climate feedback loops, playing a crucial role in the Arctic carbon cycle. Here, we analyze the stable carbon (delta 13C) and radiocarbon (F14C) isotopic compositions of dissolved CO2 and CH4 in the Sagavanirktok and Kuparuk River watersheds on the North Slope, Alaska. By examining spatial and seasonal variations in these isotopic signatures, we identify patterns of carbon release and transport across the river continuum. We find consistent CO2 isotopic values along the geomorphological gradient, reflecting a mixture of geogenic and biogenic sources integrated throughout the watershed. Bayesian mixing models further demonstrate a systematic depletion in 13C and 14C signatures of dissolved CO2 sources from spring to fall, indicating increasing contributions of aged carbon as the active layer deepens. This seasonal deepening allows percolating groundwater to access deeper, older soil horizons, transporting CO2 produced by aerobic and anaerobic soil respiration to streams and rivers. In contrast, we observe no clear relationships between the 13C and 14C compositions of dissolved CH4 and landscape properties. Given the reduced solubility of CH4, which facilitates outgassing and limits its transport in aquatic systems, the isotopic signatures are likely indicative of localized contributions from streambeds, adjacent water saturated soils, and lake outflows. Our study illustrates that dissolved greenhouse gases are sensitive indicators of old carbon release from thawing permafrost and serve as early warning signals for permafrost carbon feedbacks. It establishes a crucial baseline for understanding the role of CO2 and CH4 in regional carbon cycling and Arctic environmental change.

J	Nakano, D; Kobayashi, T; Sakaguchi, I				Nakano, Daisuke; Kobayashi, Takuya; Sakaguchi, Isamu			Differences in larval dynamics of golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei between dam reservoirs with and without an aeration system	LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei is a freshwater bivalve that adheres to water intake facilities, leading to problems of several kinds. Biofouling problems have been increasing recently in East Asia and South America, and the planktonic stage of this species is considered to play an important role in its dispersal. We investigated the larval dynamics of L. fortunei in two reservoirs, Lake Ohshio and Lake Takenuma, which are connected by a headrace channel. An aeration system for water quality conservation was present in the former reservoir but not in the latter. Larval density in Lake Ohshio was more than 10,000 individuals/m(3) with a maximum of 80,000 individuals/m(3) in summer. The density in Lake Takenuma was much lower, with a maximum of around 200 individuals/m(3). Water temperature (WT) and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration were almost uniform regardless of water depth in Lake Ohshio because of destratification due to continuous aeration. Summer WT and DO in the lake were considered to be suitable for survival and reproduction of L. fortunei. On the other hand, stratification was found for WT and DO in Lake Takenuma throughout the summer. The low WT and DO found in the deep areas of the lake in summer were considered to be not suitable for survival and reproduction of this species. Thus, the population of L. fortunei larvae differed widely even in two adjoining lakes, and WT and DO are considered to be critical factors, especially for reproduction.

J	Liu, DW; Bertrand, S; Vandekerkhove, E; Renson, V				Liu, Dawei; Bertrand, Sebastien; Vandekerkhove, Elke; Renson, Virginie			Provenance of Baker River sediments (Chile, 48°S): Implications for the identification of flood deposits in fjord sediments	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Floods are among the most destructive natural hazards on Earth. In paleohydrology, sediments are generally considered as one of the best archives to extend flood records to pre-historical timescales. Doing so requires being able to identify flood deposits from sediment archives and decipher between flood types. The latter is particularly important in glacierized regions, where meteorological floods frequently co-occur with glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). In Patagonia, results from a recent study suggest that GLOFs are recorded in downstream fjord sediments as fine-grained and organic-poor layers, representing the high amount of glacier rock flour transported during lake outbursts, whereas meteorological floods are represented by coarser and more organic deposits. However, not all fine-grained organic-poor deposits could be associated with historical GLOFs. Here, we reconstruct the provenance of these Baker River flood deposits using Sr-87/Sr-86 and epsilon Nd, taking advantage of the clear lithological differences that exist between both sides of the watershed. Our results show that both Sr-87/Sr-86 and epsilon Nd are suited to reconstruct sediment provenance in the Baker River watershed but that epsilon Nd is the most effective and the least affected by grain-size variations. Our provenance results confirm that the 21st-century fine-grained and organic-poor deposits represent GLOFs and that the largest winter meteorological flood on record has a distinct coarse and organic-rich signature. However, our results show that rain-on-snow events that occur in summer, and therefore primarily affect the western glacierized part of the watershed, have the same fine-grained organic-poor signature as GLOFs. Therefore, this study shows that the sedimentary signature of rain-on-snow floods in partially glacierized watersheds depends on the season during which they occur. We anticipate that our findings will contribute to a better interpretation of flood records from partially glacierized watersheds.					; Bertrand, Sebastien/G-9744-2011	Liu, Dawei/0000-0003-2129-8793; Bertrand, Sebastien/0000-0003-0374-4040														1096-9837				MAR 15	2022	47	3					825	838		10.1002/esp.5287	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/esp.5287		NOV 2021											WOS:000723060100001
J	Gardner, JE; Tait, S				Gardner, JE; Tait, S			The caldera-forming eruption of Volcan Ceboruco, Mexico	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												Volcan Ceboruco (Mexico) erupted similar to 1000 years ago, forming a caldera similar to 4 km in diameter. The pyroclastic deposit (Jala pumice) produced was studied at 75 sites, where thicknesses of all tephra layers were measured and, at many sites, the five coarsest lithics in each fall layer were measured. Several fall layers were also sieved for component analysis. White (rhyodacite) and gray (dacite) pumices occur in every tephra layer. The eruption began by dispersing a thin, narrowly distributed fall layer (P0) to the north. Next, a widely dispersed, coarse, Plinian fall deposit (P1), the most voluminous layer in the Jala pumice, erupted. The rest of the eruption alternated between pyroclastic surges and flows (including the Marquesado pyroclastic flow, southwest of the volcano) and Plinian falls (P2-P6). In all, 3-4 km(3) of magma erupted, similar to 95% of which was deposited as fall layers. During most of the deposition of P1, eruptive intensity (mass flux) was almost constant at 4-8x10(7) kg s(-1), producing a Plinian column 25-30 km in height. Size grading at the top of P1 indicates, however, that mass flux waned dramatically, and possibly that there was a brief pause in the eruption. During the post-pi phase of the eruption, a much smaller volume of magma erupted, although mass flux varied by more than an order of magnitude. We suggest that caldera collapse began at the end of the P1 phase of the eruption, because along with the large differences in mass flux behavior between P1 and post-P1 layers, there were also dramatic changes in lithic content: (P1 contains similar to 8% lithics; post-P1 layers contain 30-60%) and magma composition (P1 is 98% rhyodacite; post-P1 layers are 60-90% rhyodacite). However, the total volume of magma erupted during the Jala pumice event is close to that estimated for the caldera. These observations appear to conflict with models which envision that, after an eruption is initiated by overpressure in the magma chamber, caldera collapse begins when the reservoir becomes underpressurized as a result of the removal of magma. The conflict arises because firstly, the P1 layer makes up too large a proportion (similar to 75%) of the total volume erupted to correspond to an overpressurized phase, and secondly, the caldera volume exceeds the post-P1 volume of magma by at least a factor of three. The mismatches between model and observations could be reconciled if collapse began near the beginning of the eruption, but no record of such early collapse is evident in the tephra sequence. The apparent inability to place the Jala pumice eruptive sequence into existing models of caldera collapse, which were constructed to explain the formation of calderas much greater in volume than that at Ceboruco, may indicate that differences in caldera mechanics exist that depend on size or that a more general model for caldera formation is needed.					; Tait, Stephen/E-8258-2017; Gardner, James/H-1713-2011	Gardner, James/0000-0001-7078-5876; 													0258-8900					MAY	2000	62	1					20	33		10.1007/s004450050288	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004450050288													WOS:000087400100002

However, if cyanobacteria bloom outbreaks can be predicted in advance, there is enough time to implement various measures to reduce ecological harm and health risks and greatly reduce economic losses. Yuqiao Reservoir was a typical shallow-water lake reservoir that was also faced with a greater risk of cyanobacteria bloom outbreaks in summer and autumn. In this study, a BP neural network model and a two-dimensional hydrodynamic numerical model were constructed based on meteorological, hydrological, water quality, and terrain data for Yuqiao Reservoir. The neural network model was used to simulate the biogeneration and extinction processes of cyanobacteria bloom biomass, while the two-dimensional hydrodynamic numerical model was used to simulate the migration and accumulation processes of cyanobacteria. The two models were coupled by an algal attenuation coefficient for the short-term warning of algal bloom. The results of the Nash coefficient evaluation showed that the coupled model had good overall efficiency and could effectively simulate the algal density both in time and space. The results of scenario analysis showed that the change in flow field in a shallow water reservoir had a great influence on algae migration and accumulation, and water transfer, wind speed, and direction all affected the flow field distribution and then the formation of bloom. The model application results showed that the short-term bloom prediction method constructed in this study had advantages in forecasting accuracy and displayed an effect.					luo, na/KOC-3893-2024; Wang, Zilu/K-8460-2013														1230-1485	2083-5906					2025	34	1					227	235		10.15244/pjoes/186001	http://dx.doi.org/10.15244/pjoes/186001													WOS:001401865700001

In this study, a comprehensive dynamic phosphorus (P) model that integrates hydrodynamic, wind wave and sediment transport is proposed to assess the importance of internal P cycling due to sediment resuspension on water column P levels. The primary contribution of the model is detailed modeling and rigorous coupling of sediment and P dynamics. The proposed model is applied to predict the P behavior in the shallow Taihu Lake, which is the third largest lake in China, and quantitatively estimate the effects of wind waves and lake currents on P release and distribution. Both the prevailing southeast winds in summer and northwest winds in winter are applied for the simulation, and different wind speeds of 5 m/s and 10 m/s are also considered. Results show that sediment resuspension and the resulting P release have a dominant effect on P levels in. Taihu Lake, and likely similar shallow lakes. Wind-driven waves at higher wind speeds significantly enhance sediment resuspension and suspended sediment concentration (SSC). Total P concentration in the water column is also increased but not in proportion to the SSC. The different lake circulations resulting from the different prevailing wind directions also affect the distribution of suspended sediment and P around the lake ultimately influencing where eutrophication is likely to occur. The proposed model demonstrates that internal cycling in the lake is a dominant factor in the lake P and must be considered when trying to manage water quality in this and similar lakes. The model is used to demonstrate the potential effectiveness of remediation of an area where historical releases have led to P accumulation on overall lake quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, three data-gathering expeditions were conducted in Lake Hongze (HZL), China, between 2016 and 2018. Based on the in situ optical and biological data, a multivariate linear stepwise regression method was applied for retrieval of the surface horizontal distribution of TSM (TSM0.2) using GOCI (Geostationary Ocean Color Imager) data. Then, the estimation model of vertical structure of underwater TSM was constructed using layer-by-layer recursion. This study drew several crucial findings: (1) the approach proposed in this paper generated very high goodness of fit results, with determination coefficients (R-2) of 0.83 (p < 0.001, N= 54), and with smaller prediction errors (the mean absolute percentage error is determined to be 16.34%, the root mean square error is 9.01 mg(-1), and the mean ratio is 1.00, N = 26). (2) The monthly surface TSM and the column mass of suspended matter (CMSM) are affected by both wind speed and precipitation in HZL. In addition, the hourly variation of surface TSM and CMSM are driven by local wind, most especially in spring and winter. (3) Compared with the non-uniform hypothesis, the CMSM derived by conventional vertical uniformity hypothesis was underestimated by almost 10% in HZL during 2016. This should warrant the attention of lake managers and lake environmental evolution researchers. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The model was used to assess the potential effect on water quality of increasing inter-basin transfer of water from an upstream reservoir into the Qu'Appelle River system. Although water is currently transferred, the need for increased transfer is a possibility under future water management scenarios to meet water demands in the region. Output from the model indicated that flow augmentation could decrease total ammonia and orthophosphate concentrations especially at Buffalo Pound Lake throughout the year. This is because the water being transferred has lower concentrations of these nutrients than the Qu'Appelle River system, although there is complex interplay between the more dilute chemistry, and the potential to increase loads by increasing flows. A global sensitivity analysis indicated that the model output for the lake component was more sensitive to input parameters than was the model output of the river component. Sensitive parameters included dissolved organic nitrogen mineralization rate, phytoplankton nitrogen to carbon ratio, phosphorus-to-carbon ratio, maximum phytoplankton growth rate, and phytoplankton death rate. Parameter sensitivities on output variables for the lake component were similar for both summer (open water) and winter (ice-covered), whereas those for the river component were different. The complex interplay of water quality, ice behaviors, and hydrodynamics of the chained river-lake system was all coupled in WASP7. Mean absolute error varied from 0.03-0.08 NH4-N/L for ammonium to 0.5 to1.7 mg/L for oxygen, and 0.04-0.13 NO3-N/L for nitrate.

Aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) is a key indicator of grassland health and function, which is highly sensitive to variabilities in large-scale atmospheric circulations, commonly referred to as teleconnections (TCs). In this study, we analyzed the spatial and temporal variations of ANPP and their response to local meteorological and large-scale climatic variabilities across the MPG from 1982 to 2015. Our analysis indicated the following: (1) Throughout the entire study period, ANPP displayed an overall upward trend across nine ecoregions. In the Sayan montane steppe and Sayan alpine meadow ecoregions, ANPP displayed a distinct inflection point in the mid-1990s. In the Ordos Plateau arid steppe ecoregion, ANPP continuously increased without any inflection points. In the six other ecoregions, trends in ANPP exhibited two inflection points, one in the mid-1990s and one in the late-2000s. (2) Precipitation was the principal determinant of ANPP across the entire MPG. Temperature was a secondary yet important factor influencing ANPP variations in the Ordos Plateau arid steppe. Cloud cover affected ANPP in Sukhbaatar and central Dornod, Mongolia. (3) The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation affected ANPP by regulating temperature in the Ordos Plateau arid steppe ecoregion, whereas precipitation occurred in the other ecoregions. The Pacific/North America, North Atlantic Oscillation, East Atlantic/Western Russia, and Pacific Decadal Oscillation predominantly affected precipitation patterns in various ecoregions, indicating regional heterogeneities of the effects of TCs on ANPP fluctuations. When considering seasonal variances, winter TCs dominated ANPP variations in the Selenge-Orkhon forest steppe, Daurian forest steppe, and Khangai Mountains alpine meadow ecoregions. Autumn TCs, particularly the Pacific/North America and North Atlantic Oscillation, had a greater impact in arid regions like the Gobi Desert steppe and the Great Lakes Basin desert steppe ecoregions. This study's findings will enhance the theoretical framework for examining the effects of TCs on grassland ecosystems.

J	Rojas-Aguirre, AF; Bray, EN; Dozier, J				Rojas-Aguirre, Andres F.; Bray, Erin N.; Dozier, Jeff			Evaluating the effects of climate change on managed lowland rivers in the California Bay Delta Watershed	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Water that is released from reservoirs can affect the downstream thermal regimes of rivers. During the summer months, these flow releases can lower the river temperature downstream of dams in an extension that mainly depends on the volume and temperature of these releases and the energy exchange with the overlying atmosphere. The benefit of this cooling effect has been suggested as an approach to mitigate the effects of climate change in downstream-regulated rivers. However, anticipated climate change conditions may weaken these cooling benefits, especially in managed lowland rivers (MLRs), as they are subjected to large withdrawals, are shallow, and convey clear water. Here, we show that MLRs in the California Bay Delta Watershed are vulnerable to water temperature increases, especially during future summer months subjected to a future high-emission greenhouse scenario. Low-flow conditions exacerbate this vulnerability, especially at locations downstream of high-flow diversions. By using a physical energy balance model (FLUVIAL-EB) paired with a downscaled climate regional model (CRCM5-RCP8.5), we found that for summer months between 2030 and 2100, longwave and latent heat fluxes will contribute to water temperature increases, while absorbed solar radiation will likely decrease under future climate scenarios. Despite the warming effects of climate change on MLRs in the California Bay Delta Watershed, our findings suggest that increasing the release of hypolimnetic water from reservoirs during summer months can be a viable solution to mitigate the river temperature increase.

The discharges are associated with the filling of Lake Powell, the last large reservoir to be constructed on the river, and with ENSO cycles that bring extra winter and spring precipitation to the watershed. The discharges below Morelos Dam produce overbank floods that germinate new cohorts of Populus fremontii and Salix gooddingii trees. Relatively little flood water from the United States is required to support a pulse flood regime that can result in regrowth of native vegetation in the delta. Based on analysis of past flows and existing tree populations, we estimate that a February-April flow of 3 x 10(9) m(3) at 80-120 m(3) s(-1) is sufficient to germinate and establish new cohorts of native trees. However, there was a positive correlation between frequency of flows and total vegetation cover over the years 1992-1999, showing that more frequent flows would further increase vegetation cover. The results support the importance of pulse floods in restoring the ecological integrity of arid-zone rivers. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

Using the delta(18)O composition of surface water and groundwaters, the contribution of Ioannina Lake and the channel draining the lake water to the Kalamas River to the recharge of springs and boreholes was confirmed and quantitatively defined. In contrast, the Voidomatis and Vikos Rivers are not sources for recharge of the big springs along their banks. However, water from the Aoos River does replenish the aquifer in the unconsolidated deposits underlying the plain of Konitsa. In addition, limestones of Senonian-Late Eocene ages, dolomites, and limestones of the "Vigles" facies are hydraulically interconnected, and the limestones of the "Pantokrator" facies are hydraulically isolated from the other carbonate formations.																			1431-2174					APR	1999	7	2					219	226		10.1007/s100400050194	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s100400050194													WOS:000080109600009

This paper presents the atmospheric occurrence and distribution of pesticides including organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), organophosphate pesticides (OPPs), acid herbicides (AHs), and neutral herbicides (NHs) during the spring to summer of 2004 and 2005 across agricultural regions in Canada. Atmospheric concentrations of pesticides varied within years and time periods, and regional characteristics were observed including the following: (i) highest air concentrations of several herbicides (e.g., mecoprop, triallate, and ethalfluralin) were found at Bratt's Lake, SK, a site in the Canadian Prairies; (ii) the west-coast site at Abbotsford, BC, had the maximum concentrations of diazinon; (iii) the fruit and vegetable growing region in Vineland, ON, showed highest levels for several insecticides including chlorpyrifos, endosulfan, and azinphos-methyl; (iv) high concentrations of atrazine and metolachlor were measured at St.Anicet, QC, a corn-growing region; (v) the Kensington site in PEI, Canada's largest potato-producing province, exhibited highest level of dimethoate. Analysis of particle- and gas-phase fractions of air samples revealed that most pesticides including OCPs, OPPs, and NHs exist mainly in the gas phase, while AHs exhibit more diversity in particle-gas partitioning behavior. This study also demonstrated that stirred up soil dust does not account for pesticides that are detected in the particle phase. The estimated dry and wet deposition fluxes indicate considerable atmospheric inputs for some current-use pesticides (CUPs). This data set represents the first measurements for many pesticides in the atmosphere, precipitation, and soil forgiven agricultural regions across Canada.					; Yao, Yuan/A-9150-2017	Tuduri, Ludovic/0000-0003-1930-6192; 													0013-936X					AUG 15	2008	42	16					5931	5937		10.1021/es800878r	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es800878r								18767647					WOS:000258439600018

The method was validated in Lake Kinneret (Israel) over 10 days in summer to early winter 2001, Valle de Bravo Reservoir (Mexico) on 1 July 2004 and Winam Gulf (Kenya) on 1 May and 12 August 2005. The method was applied for cases where the horizontal pressure gradient in the surface layer was negligible, the photic depth was deeper than the diurnal surface layer and the increment in temperature in photic region was considerably larger than the thermistor's precision. In all these tests, the errors of the estimated values of Kd(PAR) were mostly within 10% of the actual direct measurements. Investigations of the sensitivity of the model revealed that the accuracy of the method depended primarily on the precision and accuracy of the thermistors as well as the vertical resolution of the temperature measurements in the surface layer; all of these determine the rate of convergence of the optimisation scheme.

C	Hebbink, A		Marino, MA; Simonovic, SP		Hebbink, A			WINBOS: a decision support system for deriving water management strategies for the northern part of The Netherlands	INTEGRATED WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT	IAHS PUBLICATION				International Symposium on Integrated Water Resources Management	APR, 2000	UNIV CALIF, DAVIS, CA	Int Assoc Hydrol Sci, Int Commiss Wate Resourced Syst	UNIV CALIF			A project entitled "Water management in the northern part of The Netherlands" (WIN) has been started to develop a strategy for future water quantity management of the IJsselmeer region and the North Sea canal and Amsterdam-Rhine canal. The strategy must be one with political and social support approved by the majority of organizations using these water systems. It is a complex process because the IJsselmeer region has many functions (safety, recreation, fishery, nature, etc.), which means that there are many organizations involved with different and sometimes conflicting interests. The strategy is also of concern for the regional water systems of the surrounding areas which depend on Lake IJsselmeer for their water supply in summer, and for discharge in winter. To achieve this goal the Dutch Ministry of Transport and Public Works has decided to use two tools: a collaborative planning process and a decision support system (DSS). The emphasis of this paper is the role of the decision support system in this process. The DSS, called WINBOS, has to show the outcome (costs) of changes in water quantity management on all the functions of the IJsselmeer region and the two canals. It provides information for a clear and well-founded discussion between decision makers and users.																			0144-7815		1-901502-71-6				2001		272					63	68																WOS:000177182900010

Quantitative, medium- to long-term studies are needed to understand how some common agricultural practices, such as the discharge of crop irrigation in the vicinities of large lakes, may affect lake salinization. In this study, hydrological, hydrodynamics, water quality and meteorological datasets were used to analyze the long-term spatial-temporal variations of water salinities of a major lake, the Chagan Lake, in Northeast China. An integrated hydrodynamics-salinity model was used to simulate lake water salinity changes taking place at different times and locations, including (i) salt accumulations during a non-frozen period, and (ii) the time when water salinity may reach a significant threshold (1 psu) that jeopardizes a major environmental and economic value of this lake (i.e., the cultivation of local fish species). The results confirmed that Chagan Lake was indeed undergoing salinization in the ten year period between 2008 and 2018. The spatial-temporal patterns of the salinization processes were identified. For instance, (i) the mean salinity of the lake water was found to be 0.55 psu in the summer season of the region and 0.53 psu in the winter, and (ii) between May to October the salinity was up to 0.62 psu in the western region of the lake. The rate of salt accumulation was found to be 97 ton per annum during the non-frozen period. The simulation predicted that by 2024 the lake water will become sub-saline (salinity > 1.07 psu) which is toxic to fish species, if the current practice of irrigation discharge into the lake continues. In the scenario that the amount of irrigation discharges into the lake doubles, the western region of the lake will become sub-saline within one year, and then the whole lake within three years. Overall, this study has produced results that are useful to authorities around the world, for balancing the risks and benefits of developing crop irrigation fields in areas surrounding large freshwater lakes.					; Wu, Yao/HSG-5577-2023; Xu, Y.

To date, N. limnetica had only been detected in small German and North American inland water bodies. On determination of the 18S rDNA sequence, the three new strains were found to be identical to each other and to the type strain KR 1998/3 (GenBank accession no. AF251496). Rapid analysis of polymorphic DNA-PCR revealed that the genotypes were different, although the Baikalian eustigmatophycean strains were more similar to each other compared with the type strain KR 1998/3 from Germany. Ecophysiological differences were also evident between the new strains from Lake Baikal and the type strain from growth rate determinations. The morphological characteristics were similar to that of a previous description of the species. However, although the cells of Eustigmatophyceae usually propagate by autosporulation, in these newly detected species germination of single daughter cells from thick-walled cells was observed for the first time. Based on pigment analysis, the occurrence of Eustigmatophyceae in Lake Baikal was estimated. Eustigmatophyceae were established to be common members of the phytoplankton community of this large oligotrophic Siberian lake and occurred throughout the year, even under the ice cover during winter. Moreover, they peaked during early summer and in the South Basin. Hence, the widely accepted opinion that Chlorophyceae solely comprise the eukaryotic picoplankton should be changed and the Eustigmatophyceae considered.

J	Pöckl, M				Poeckl, Manfred			Success of the invasive Ponto-Caspian amphipod Dikerogammarus villosus by life history traits and reproductive capacity	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS					15th International Conference on Aquatic Invasive Species (ICAIS)	SEP 23-27, 2007	Nijmegen, NETHERLANDS					Dikerogammarus villosus originates from the Ponto-Caspian basin. In the Austrian stretch of the River Danube it was not found before 1989, and not before 1992 in the Bavarian Danube. It very quickly spread to Germany, the Netherlands, and France via the so called "Southern Corridor". The invader also migrates via the "Central Corridor", reaching as far west as the Vistula River. The species has been reported from a number of lakes. Reasons for the quick spread and high abundance are, beside others, its life history traits. A population of this invasive species was studied from 2002 to 2004 in the Austrian stretch of the Danube. The following life-history traits are important in the invasion success: long reproductive period, early sexual maturity, short generation time, a life span not exceeding 1 year (up to three generations and 14 cohorts being present at the same time), high growth rates resulting in large body size, short duration of embryonic development, large numbers of comparatively small eggs in the brood pouch, large reproductive capacity, and optimal timing to release the maximum number of neonates per female in May/June (maximising rapid growth at high summer temperatures and at times of plentiful food), increasing mating privilege for large specimens of both sexes with decreasing water temperatures during winter. These life cycle characteristics together with its predatory behaviour and its ability to cope with variation in oxygen, temperature and salinity, give this invader a potential to become distributed in freshwater ecosystems of the temperate climate zone all over the world. Additionally, several indications seem to prove the tendency that biological invasion and global warming have a positive feed-back on each other. This combined scenario is a huge threat to the indigenous aquatic fauna, and might contribute to bio-monotony.																			1387-3547	1573-1464				NOV	2009	11	9			SI		2021	2041		10.1007/s10530-009-9485-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-009-9485-5													WOS:000270646300004

Cold water temperatures and an ambush hunting strategy may constrain Northern Pike Esox lucius, limiting their postrelease movements to a small area near the capture location. We used manual acoustic telemetry to track 15 Northern Pike ranging from 56 to 98.5 cm total length for up to 7 d after catch-and-release ice angling in Buffalo Pound Lake, Saskatchewan, Canada. All of the fish but one moved unexpectedly long distances of several km over the tracking period. For the fish that were tracked over all 7 d, path lengths traveled ranged from 1.4 to 18.4 km. The minimum daily distance traveled ranged from 0 to 4.6 km and varied significantly by tracking day; the fish moved shorter distances on day 4 postrelease. There was a significant interaction between fish size and day postrelease; larger fish moved shorter minimum daily distances and dispersed shorter distances from the release site over the first 2 d of tracking. In contrast, by 5 d after release, both the largest and smallest fish had dispersed the longest distances from the release site and intermediate-sized fish dispersed the least. The cumulative path length traveled by day 5 of tracking did not reveal any significant size-based patterns. Our study raises the possibility that relatively large movements may be common for Northern Pike in the winter despite cold water temperatures and their expected foraging behavior. In addition, postrelease behavior varies with fish size. Habitat and space requirements for Northern Pike in the winter can encompass much larger areas and more habitat features than has been previously envisioned.					; Somers, Christopher/AAE-6390-2019; Fisher, Ryan/LNR-2693-2024	Fisher, Ryan/0000-0002-6398-2334; Goncin, Una/0000-0002-2058-1194; 													0275-5947	1548-8675				OCT	2021	41	5					1341	1350		10.1002/nafm.10638	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10638		JUN 2021											WOS:000668195300001

Effects of a rock-ramp fishway on summer fish assemblage in a Lake Huron tributary	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												The use of nature-like fishways to increase ecosystem connectivity has increased in recent years, but their effectiveness has rarely been evaluated. A rock ramp was constructed in the Shiawassee River in 2009, and post-construction effects (2011-2012) were evaluated on the summer fish assemblage by comparing fish assemblage composition to a nearby free-flowing river and a nearby river with a dam. Patterns of fish species richness, mean catch-per-unit-effort and proportional abundance in reaches upstream and downstream of the rock ramp, dam and comparable sites in the free-flowing river were evaluated. Overall, species richness by site and proportional abundance in the rock-ramp river were more similar to the free-flowing river, while species richness by reach was more similar to the dammed river. These findings suggest that the rock ramp has improved connectivity for the summer fish assemblage, but has not fully restored conditions to the level observed in a free-flowing river.																			0969-997X	1365-2400				OCT	2016	23	5					407	417		10.1111/fme.12183	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fme.12183													WOS:000384672400007

Geographic isolation of Escherichia coli genotypes in sediments and water of the Seven Mile Creek - A constructed riverine watershed	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Escherichia coli is used to indicate fecal contamination in freshwater systems and is an indicator of the potential presence of human pathogens. However, naturalized E. coli strains that persist and grow in the environment confound the use of this bacterium as a fecal indicator. Here we examined the spatial and temporal distribution of E. coli in water and sediments of the Seven Mile Creek (SMC), a constructed, ephemeral watershed. E. coli concentrations showed variation by site and date, likely due to changes in temperature and rainfall. Horizontal fluorophore enhanced rep-PCR (HFERP) DNA fingerprint analyses indicated that E. coli populations were very diverse and consisted of transient and naturalized strains, which were especially prevalent in sediment. E. coli fingerprints from water and sediment collected in the same year clustered together with significant overlap, indicating exchange of strains between matrices. Isolates obtained during periods of flow, but not during non-flow conditions, clustered together regardless of sample site, indicating that transport between sites occurred. Naturalized E. coli strains were found in the SMC and strains become geographically isolated and distinct during non-flow conditions. Isolates collected during late spring to fall clustered together at each site, suggesting that temperature and growth of naturalized strains are likely factors affecting population dynamics. Results of this study show that newly introduced and naturalized E. coli strains are present in the SMC. Results of this study highlight an important concern for resource managers using this species for water quality monitoring. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	TALBOT, MR				TALBOT, MR			PALEOHYDROLOGY OF THE LATE MIOCENE RIDGE BASIN LAKE, CALIFORNIA	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Uppermost Miocene lacustrine deposits of the Ridge basin, California, contain benthic microbial carbonates as fragmentary crusts on clasts in resedimented conglomerates of the Violin Breccia, deposited adjacent to the fault-controlled southwestern margin of the basin, and as fragments and more extensive, in situ stromatolitic units within the Ridge Route Formation around the northeastern part of the basin. Ridge Route microbialites formed in the open waters of the Ridge basin paleolake and have delta(18)O values that are significantly higher than those from the Violin Breccia. The latter may have formed in warm, littoral pools or in streams maintained by local runoff. Their delta(18)O compositions are consistent with carbonate precipitation from meteoric waters supplied by rainfall dominated by 67%-75% winter precipitation at temperatures of 16-17 degrees C. Ridge Route Formation microbialites have a wide range of delta(13) and delta(18)O values and indicate that the lake fluctuated between hydrologically open and closed conditions. Light carbon isotopic compositions for carbonate that precipitated during periods of open-basin conditions suggest that inflow waters came from a fluvial system with a well-vegetated flood or delta plain. Relatively high delta(18)O values imply that the lake was not maintained by local rainfall but depended on inflow that came either from an upstream lake or from a region to the east or northeast where the rainfall regime was dominated by isotopically heavy summer precipitation.																			0016-7606					SEP	1994	106	9					1121	1129		10.1130/0016-7606(1994)106<1121:POTLMR>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0016-7606(1994)106<1121:POTLMR>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1994PE28900002

The turbidity in Lake Imha which is the eighth largest multipurpose dam in Korea has been the cause of major water quality problems for use as drinking water. The turbidity rose to 882 NTU, and it remained over 30 NTU continuously for 170 days during 2002, as the result of significant amounts of soil erosion from the watershed during the Asian monsoon typhoon. In this study, characteristics of suspended sediment loadings under the Asian summer monsoon climate was investigated by comparing the variation of yearly suspended sediment loads and the ratio of maximum suspended sediment loads in a single event to yearly suspended sediment load from Lake Imha watershed using the Hydrologic Simulation Program-FORTRAN (HSPF). The model calibration is performed according to the 2009-2010 events, and simulation results characterized suspended sediment loadings under the Asian summer monsoon climate for 2001-2010. Water sampling and flow rate measurements were performed every 4-6 h, and calibration was performed using hourly simulated sediment loads. The calibration results demonstrated good agreement with the observed data. The characteristics of suspended sediment loadings under the Asian summer monsoon climate are a high variance of the yearly suspended sediment load and a significant of amount of suspended sediment load during a single event influenced by the typhoon intensity. The maximum yearly suspended sediment load was 10 times higher than the minimum yearly value. About half of the yearly suspended sediment load was loaded with a single event under the Asian summer monsoon climate and the ratio of suspended sediment loads by a single event to total yearly loads ranged from 29% to 90%. Structural best management practices (BMPs) to trap suspended sediment in stormwater such as stormwater ponds or wetlands rely on much more storage volume or area and non-structural BMPs to minimize soil erosion by source control such as mulching or revegetation in disturbed areas, which are important BMPs, especially in the Asian summer monsoon region.																			2071-1050					JAN	2017	9	1							44	10.3390/su9010044	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su9010044													WOS:000394842700044

Threadfin shad represented 88% of the fish consumed and represented a similar proportion, by volume, of the stomach contents. Threadfin shad made up the majority of the diet except during spring when they were infrequently preyed upon. Invertebrates, including crustacean zooplankton, crayfish, and chironomid larvae, were common in the diet during spring. Composition of the diet was similar in both years of our study (1981 and 1982), but fewer prey, especially threadfin shad, were consumed in 1982.																			0038-4909	1943-6262				MAR	1989	34	1					118	123		10.2307/3671816	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3671816													WOS:A1989U168800012

To mitigate shipping emissions, China introduced the Domestic Emission Control Area (DECA) policy in phases: DECA 1.0 in 2016 and DECA 2.0 in 2019. DECA 1.0 mandated low-sulfur fuels (0.5 %) at berth and near major ports, down from 1.5 %, and this requirement was extended to a 12-nautical-mile emission control zone in DECA 2.0. In this study, we conducted long-term online measurements of shipping emission tracer of vanadium (V) and nickel (Ni), at the Dian Shan Lake (DSL) supersite, located approximately 50 km from Shanghai waters. The observed V concentration exhibited a strong dependence on wind direction, with higher levels from spring to summer due to more frequent marine winds compared to other seasons. The long-term measurement showed a significant decrease in V concentrations, dropping from an annual mean of 7.08 ng m-3 during DECA 1.0 to 2.64 ng m-3 during DECA 2.0. The represents a year-on-year reduction of 63 % based on measurement. To remove the meteorological impact on the measured concentration, a Random Forest (RF) machine learning model and the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ 5.4) model were applied under a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario. Both models produced consistent results, showing a reduction of up to 82 % in V concentrations in April with more frequent marine winds, confirming regional air quality improvements post-DECA 2.0. Additionally, we found that Ni has other sources that require further control beyond shipping. The study highlights the importance of long-term measurements for understanding the impact of air quality policies on emission patterns.

J	KOHLER, J				KOHLER, J			INFLUENCE OF TURBULENT MIXING ON GROWTH AND PRIMARY PRODUCTION OF MICROCYSTIS-AERUGINOSA IN THE HYPERTROPHIC BAUTZEN RESERVOIR	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												In the hypertrophic, soft-water Bautzen Reservoir the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa contributed 72.2 +/- 13.3% to the total phytoplankton biomass (369 +/- 163 mg chla m-2) from mid June to the beginning of September in 1986. In this shallow (mean depth 5.0 m), wind-exposed reservoir the weak thermal stratification was frequently interrupted by mixing periods. Due to active rising of Microcystis colonies, 79.2 +/- 4.2% of phytoplankton biomass was concentrated under calm conditions in the euphotic layer compared with 54.8 +/- 12.3% in turbulent mixing. Under the former conditions the population was able to convert photosynthetically 2.80 +/- 0.50% of incident PhAR into chemical energy, under the latter only 1.60 +/- 0.76%. Photosynthesis of phytoplankton dominated by Microcystis aeruginosa was light-saturated at 253 +/- 81.7-mu-E m-2 s-1. The I(k)-values of spring phytoplankton (mainly centric diatoms) were lower (133 +/- 75.5-mu-E m-2 s-1). Under light limited conditions, Microcystis fixed only 2.9-5.6 mg C mg chal-1 E-1 m2 compared with 5.6-11.5 mg C per mg chla E-1 m2 assimilated by spring populations. Under conditions of turbulent mixing the primary production and the portion of fixed carbon lost by exudation were reduced in July - August. Positive growth rates of the Microcystis population were limited to periods with thermal stratification of the water column. Despite reduced primary production, the biomass of M. aeruginosa often still remained high in mixing conditions (growth rates near zero). The specific primary productivity of M. aeruginosa in the surface samples was inhibited by PhAR > 1100-mu-E m-2 s-1 during or immediately after mixing periods but no longer after two or more calm days. The mean daily production of Microcystis amounted to 4.4 (maximum 10) g C m-2 though free CO2 was never detectable in epilimnion because of high pH (summer mean 8.85). During the 10 weeks of Microcystis dominance 71% of the annual primary production (498 g C m-2) was yielded.

P concentrations were also determined in the corresponding interstitial water. Enzyme Labeled Fluorescence (ELF) was used for localizing extracellular phosphatase on phytoplankton cell membranes in April. The increase in phytoplankton density was paralleled by a significant increase in soluble reactive P (SRP) concentrations in the water column and interstitial water at all sites from January to April, with chlorophyte gradually becoming dominant. In February, at the undredged site, more algae dominated by chlorophyte occurred in overlying water, rather than in the surface, coinciding with higher SRP concentrations in overlying and interstitial water. Therefore, P status in the bottom is important to phytoplankton development in terms of density and composition. Undredged sites had higher SRP concentrations in interstitial water than dredged sites. Furthermore, Higher APA was observed, accompanied by higher dissolved organic P (DOP) and lower total P at the undredged site in February. Enzymatic hydrolysis of DOP may have been an additional source of P for phytoplankton. In April, Schroederia sp. was ELF labeled in surface water at the dredged site, which showed markedly lower SRP concentration, but not at the undredged site with higher SRP concentration. Thus, the dredging might regulate algal density and composition in water column by reducing P bioavailability.																			0018-8158					MAY	2007	581						287	295		10.1007/s10750-006-0516-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0516-2													WOS:000244992800029

The Ebinur Lake Basin has experienced a serious ecological crisis in recent years, which is majorly due to excess use of its water. Therefore, in this study, we used Ebinur Lake as a research object, and used Geographic Information System and remote sensing technology, Landsat, Sentinel, and MODIS images, the Google Earth Engine platform, and the water body index method to determine the changes in lake area from April to October of 2011-2020. Daily data from the Alashankou and Jinghe meteorological stations from 2011 to 2020 were collected. The center of gravity-geographically and temporally weighted regression model was used to analyze the factors changes in surface area. The results showed obvious spatial and temporal heterogeneities for the surface area. Except for 2016, which had unusual/extreme weather, in the last decade, the lake surface area generally showed a monthly decreasing trend from April to October. When Ebinur Lake is one water body, the surface area ranges between 530 and 560 km(2). We concluded that the spatio-temporal characteristics of Ebinur Lake can be divided into two levels. When the southeast and northwest regions of the lake merge, it represents the largest possible surface area of Ebinur Lake; this was called the "water storage level ". Historically, Ebinur Lake has lost significant amounts of water, and there is no water body connecting the two main parts of the lake (thereby dividing the lake into two areas); this was called "water demand level ". The trajectory of the center of gravity of the lake is linear, with a slope of 45 & DEG; and a direction of northwest to southeast. The lake gravity center has different aggregation states. According to the season, it can be divided into spring gathering and autumn gathering. The variation in the surface area of Ebinur Lake is highly correlated with the meteorological and hydrological variation during the year. The highest correlation was observed between lake surface area and wind speed. This study aimed to supplement other studies that explore the lake annually and provide a reference for future water resources management and planning.					; Wang, Lei/GXG-9534-2022; Yao, Junqiang/O-7681-2019	Yao, Chenglong/0009-0007-5964-1709; 														2296-665X				SEP 6	2022	10								994260	10.3389/fenvs.2022.994260	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.994260													WOS:000860568400001
J	Lewis, WM; McCutchan, JH; Roberson, J				Lewis, William M., Jr.; McCutchan, James H., Jr.; Roberson, Jennifer			Effects of Climatic Change on Temperature and Thermal Structure of a Mountain Reservoir	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												A 35-year monitoring record for the water column of Lake Dillon, a reservoir of the southern Rocky Mountains, shows near-surface warming of 0.76 degrees C/decade and warming at all greater depths (55 m); warming was progressively smaller with depth. Annual heat budget of the lake increased (67 cal.cm(-2).year(-1); 0.089 W/m(2)) as did Schmidt stability (41%). The mixed layer was affected by climatic conditions at the high elevation of the lake (2,750 m above mean sea level); heat fluxes were high during both the seasonal warming and cooling. Density gradients below the mixed layer were weak because of low water temperatures associated with high elevation. Annual cooling of the mixed layer was rapid following a brief initial stabilization and showed high interannual variability across years for a given month, which obscured any trend in mixed layer thickness that might have been caused by heat accumulation. The hypolimnion was warmed by advective heat exchange from tributary inflow and deep water withdrawal, not by carryover of fall or spring warming; advective warming by tributaries can be expected in many reservoirs. Plain Language Summary Lake Dillon, a mountain reservoir in Colorado, showed a high degree of surface warming (2.5 degrees C) over a 35-year interval as a result of climate change. Reservoirs have not been studied for response to climatic warming. Release of water from the bottom of the lake, which is common for reservoirs, caused Lake Dillon to show warming of deep water caused by replacement of cool water withdrawn through the outlet by inflowing river water, which showed climatic warming over the 35 years. Lake Dillon, which has higher elevation (2,750 m above mean sea level) than other lakes that have been studied for response to warming, did not show change in thickness of its surface layer (epilimnion) in response to warming, as expected at lower elevation, because the low surface temperatures of Lake Dillon cause irregularity in thickness of the mixed layer that overwhelms any tendency for the epilimnetic thickness to change in response to climate warming.

J	BAK, F; PFENNIG, N				BAK, F; PFENNIG, N			MICROBIAL SULFATE REDUCTION IN LITTORAL SEDIMENT OF LAKE CONSTANCE	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Porewater concentrations of SO4(2-) and NO3-, the depth distribution of FeS, FeS2 and organically bound sulfur, and the spatial distribution and intensity of dissimilatory microbial sulfate reduction were studied at a littoral site in Lake Constance. Porewater sulfate concentrations dropped steeply from about 300-mu-M at the surface to 10-20-mu-M at 5-6 cm depth. Free H2S could not be detected in porewater samples. Of the total sediment sulfur 53% was present in an organically bound form, 41% as pyrite and S(o) and only 6% as acid volatile sulfur (FeS). The concentrations of dissolved anions and the rates of sulfate reduction showed intensive short- and long-term variations consistent with the strong seasonal changes of temperature and water level. Sulfate reduction rates were lowest just after the spring thaw (ca. 300-400 nmol cm-2 day-1), but increased strongly toward summer and reached a maximum of more than 2000 nmol cm-2 day-1 in September. The zone of most intense sulfate reduction was restricted to the upper 3 cm of the sediment with a distinct maximum at a depth of 1-2 cm. In deeper zones sulfate reduction rates declined markedly. The apparent activation energy of sulfate reduction, determined by slurry experiments, was 54.1 kJ mol-1; the corresponding Q10-value was 2.25 (between 5 and 15-degrees-C). Concentrations of sulfate greater 60-mu-M did not increase rates in sediment slurries. The relation between sulfate reduction rates and sulfate concentration was not in accordance with Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics. Thiosulfate or nitrate added to sediment slurries was rapidly consumed with rates of 2620 nmol cm-3 day-1 and 59800 nmol cm-3 day-1, respectively. Sulfate was formed parallel to the decrease of thiosulfate, most likely due to bacterial thiosulfate disproportionation.																			0168-6496					FEB	1991	85	1					31	42		10.1016/0378-1097(91)90629-O	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0378-1097(91)90629-O													WOS:A1991FB27400005

Artifact Ingestion in Sea Ducks Wintering at Northeastern Lake Ontario	WATERBIRDS												The incidence of lead shot, ingestion in waterfowl has declined in the lower Great Lakes (LGL) following the 1999 Canada-wide ban on use of toxic shot for waterfowl hunting, but few data exist on ingestion frequencies of spent shot or fishing weights for sea ducks wintering at the LGL. Artifact ingestion was evaluated in 269 Buffleheads (Bucephala albeola), 224 Common Goldeneyes (B. clangula) and 256 Long-tailed Ducks (Clangula hyemalis) collected at Lake Ontario during winter 2002-03 and 2003-04. Long-tailed Ducks ingested total shot (lead and steel shot combined) more frequently (6.6%) than did Common Goldeneye (1.8%) and Bufflehead (0.4%). Lead shot was ingested by Long-tailed Ducks (5.1%) and Buffleheads (0.4%), but not by Common Goldeneyes. One Long-tailed Duck, 0.1% of all specimens, ingested one lead fishing weight. Substrate type influenced artifact ingestion frequency and diving ducks that specialize on prey associated with hard substrates may continue to ingest artifacts more than ducks using soft substrate marshes. The results suggest lead toxicosis from spent shotgun pellets is presently non-existent to low in sea ducks wintering at northeastern Lake Ontario and that further restrictions on use of lead fishing tackle may have little implication for sea ducks in this region.

Effects of Rossby Waves Breaking and Atmospheric Blocking Formation on the Extreme Forest Fire and Floods in Eastern Siberia 2019	FIRE-SWITZERLAND												In 2019, the southern region of Eastern Siberia (located between 45 degrees N and 60 degrees N) experienced heavy floods, while the northern region (between 60 degrees N and 75 degrees N) saw intense forest fires that lasted for almost the entire summer, from 25 June to 12 August. To investigate the causes of these natural disasters, we analyzed the large-scale features of atmospheric circulation, specifically the Rossby wave breaking and atmospheric blocking events. In the summer of 2019, two types of Rossby wave breaking were observed: a cyclonic type, with a wave breaking over Siberia from the east (110 degrees E-115 degrees E), and an anticyclonic type, with a wave breaking over Siberia from the west (75 degrees E-90 degrees E). The sequence of the Rossby wave breaking and extreme weather events in summer, 2019 are as follows: 24-26 June (cyclonic type, extreme precipitation, flood), 28-29 June and 1-2 July (anticyclonic type, forest fires), 14-17 July (both types of breaking, forest fires), 25-28 July (cyclonic type, extreme precipitation, flood), 2 and 7 August (anticyclonic type, forest fires). Rossby wave breaking occurred three times, resulting in the formation and maintenance of atmospheric blocking over Eastern Siberia: 26 June-3 July, 12-21 July and 4-10 August. In general, the scenario of the summer events was as follows: cyclonic Rossby wave breaking over the southern part of Eastern Siberia (45 degrees N-60 degrees N) caused extreme precipitation (floods) and led to low gradients of potential vorticity and potential temperature in the west and east of Lake Baikal. The increased wave activity flux from the Europe-North Atlantic sector caused the anticyclonic-type Rossby wave breaking to occur west of the area of a low potential vorticity gradient and north of 60 degrees N. This, in turn, contributed to the maintenance of blocking anticyclones in the north of Eastern Siberia, which led to the intensification and expansion of the area of forest fires. These events were preceded by an increase in the amplitude of the quasi-stationary wave structure over the North Atlantic and Europe during the first half of June.					; Devyatova, Elena/AAD-7640-2020; Krupchatnikov, Vladimir/A-4933-2014; Martynova, Yuliya/J-9067-2013; Antokhin, Pavel/A-5025-2014; Arshinov, Mikhail/A-5953-2014; Pustovalov, Konstantin/H-7407-2017; Tarabukina, Lena/P-6598-2015; Belan, Boris/A-6506-2014	Antokhin, Pavel/0000-0003-4064-5594; Martynova, Yuliya/0000-0002-1144-5393; Gochakov, Aleksander/0000-0001-9909-9730; Tarabukina, Lena/0000-0003-2290-1320; Belan, Boris/0000-0003-1481-6847; Pustovalov, Konstantin/0000-0002-2423-0543													2571-6255					MAR	2023	6	3							122	10.3390/fire6030122	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fire6030122													WOS:000955604300001
J	Wan, WJ; Zhou, LZ; Song, YW				Wan, Wenjing; Zhou, Lizhi; Song, Yunwei			Shifts in foraging behavior of wintering Hooded Cranes (Grus monacha) in three different habitats at Shengjin Lake, China	AVIAN RESEARCH												Background: Wetland loss and degradation result in a reduction in the availability and quality of food for wintering waterbirds. Birds normally modify their foraging behavior to adapt to variations in food availability. In this study, we compared shifts in foraging behavior of Hooded Cranes (Grus monacha) in three different habitats at Shengjin Lake, China to understand the response of these cranes to changes in habitat. Methods: We investigated the food density and foraging behavior of Hooded Cranes in Shengjin Lake National Nature Reserve from November 2014 to April 2015. We used regression equations to describe the changes in food density. A total of 397 behavioral observations were used in the analyses of their foraging efforts. We fitted a candidate set of generalized mixed linear models to analyze the relationship of foraging efforts and food density. We used a method of information theory to guide the selection of the model and Akaike's Information Criterion to calculate the value of each model. The relationship between food density, disturbances and foraging behavior was illustrated using a generalized linear model. Results: Along with the temporal variation and exploitation of food biomass, the food density varied widely among foraging sites. During the early winter period, foraging efforts were more pronounced in the paddy fields and meadows but not significantly different among the three habitats. The cranes spent more foraging effort in the paddy fields and meadows during the middle stage and in the meadows and mudflats during the late winter. The results of the generalized linear model showed that food density and disturbances had different effects on the rate of foraging success during the winter, while the effect of foraging effort was not significant. Furthermore, the rate of feeding success was markedly affected by disturbances in the paddy fields. The combined action of food density and disturbances had a significant effect on the rate of foraging success in the meadows, while the effect of foraging effort was also not significant in three habitats. Conclusions: Changes in foraging behavior were significant in three habitats, which were affected by food density and disturbances. The rate of foraging success increased in the habitat with low food density and low disturbances to increase the foraging efficiency in the lake. With abundant food and a high level of disturbance, the rate of foraging success decreased to ensure more secure access to food.					; Zhou, Lizhi/AAF-4535-2021	zhouZhou, li zhiLizhi/0000-0002-5702-4658; 													2053-7166					AUG 17	2016	7								13	10.1186/s40657-016-0047-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40657-016-0047-0													WOS:000386796600001

The following oil spill treatments were considered: no treatment, dispersant alone, mineral fines (MF) alone, and dispersant+MF. The aim was to determine their influences on the fate of spilled CLB at sea. When dispersant alone was used, the highest dispersion effectiveness (DE) was noted, and DE ranged from 45% to 59% under the selected environmental conditions. With no treatment and treatment of MF alone, CLB DE was insufficient under tested conditions. Total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) concentration in the water column was highest for the dispersant alone, followed by that of dispersant+MF. TPH concentration for the dispersant alone increased abruptly with time. Droplet size distribution (DSD) resulting from dispersant alone had a unimodal shape, which was different than previously observed when conventional oils were treated with the dispersant. Cases of dispersant+MF were thus characterized by a broader DSD compared with dispersant only and a gradual increase in TPH concentration. This suggests that MF could be used with dispersant as a means to control the release of toxic compounds into the water column and for better engineering the response.

J	BUIJSE, AD; SCHAAP, LA; BULT, TP				BUIJSE, AD; SCHAAP, LA; BULT, TP			INFLUENCE OF WATER CLARITY ON THE CATCHABILITY OF 6 FRESH-WATER FISH SPECIES IN BOTTOM TRAWLS	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Bottom trawl surveys are carried out every autumn to estimate the relative abundance of six major fish species, especially that of pikeperch (Stizostedion lucioperca) and Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis), in the 182 000-ha Lake IJssel, The Netherlands. The catchability of these species is influenced by light intensity at the bottom and therefore by water clarity and water depth. In autumn, water clarity can differ greatly from day to day because of wind-mediated resuspension of sediments. Catchability of ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernua) and age 0 pikeperch showed a significant inverse relationship with light intensity at the bottom, and therefore, a correction should be made when catch data for these species are used to estimate population size or year-class strength. Results were not consistent for perch, while for smelt (Osmerus eperlanus), roach (Rutilus rutilus), and bream (Abramis brama) the influence of light intensity on catchability was not significant. Corrected and uncorrected estimates of the abundance of age 0 pikeperch, based on trawl samples, were compared to demonstrate the effect of water clarity on the estimation of year-class strength. Increased water clarity can lead to zero catches and consequently diminish the effectiveness of sampling programmes.																			0706-652X					MAY	1992	49	5					885	893		10.1139/f92-099	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f92-099													WOS:A1992HT32800005
J	Szklarek, S; Górecka, A; Wojtal-Frankiewicz, A				Szklarek, Sebastian; Gorecka, Aleksandra; Wojtal-Frankiewicz, Adrianna			The effects of road salt on freshwater ecosystems and solutions for mitigating chloride pollution-A review	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Road salt (mainly NaCl) is commonly used during the winter to ensure road and pavement safety; however, the long-term application of NaCl has negative consequences on soil and the water environment. The aims of the present review were to evaluate the impact of road salt on catchment processes which accelerate the eutrophication of waters, and to identify a possible approach for reducing the impact of winter salt treatments of roads and sidewalks, on water body quality. The objectives were implemented in accordance with the ecohydrological approach, which recommends using hierarchical steps to solve problems. The first step was the monitoring of threats, in which the causes of high chloride (Cl) concentrations in groundwater and surface water were identified. The results indicate that long-term winter application of road salt increases the annual mean concentrations of Cl in rivers and lakes, due to Cl entering groundwater. The second step was a cause-effect analysis of the impact of NaCl on the abiotic processes in soil and water, and on the biotic response to chloride exposure. Chlorides appear to decrease the biodiversity of aquatic animals and plants but favour the growth of phytoplankton, especially cyanobacteria. Moreover, Cl reduces the self-purification processes of water by decreasing nutrient accumulation in macrophytes, decreasing the denitrification rate and reducing organic matter decomposition. The third step was to evaluate possible solutions for reducing the negative impact of NaCl on the environment, and to improve the effectiveness of alternative de-icing agents. An analysis of available literature indicates that a system-based approach integrating engineering knowledge with an understanding of biological and hydrological processes is necessary to indicate solutions for reducing environmental risks from road salt use.

The lack of long, continuous paleo-records prevents an examination of terrestrial responses to climate change with sufficient detail to answer questions about how systems behaved in the past and may alter in the future. We use high-resolution records of pollen, clay mineralogy, and particle size from a drill core from Lake Malawi, southeast Africa, to examine atmosphere-biosphere-geosphere interactions during the last deglaciation (similar to 18-9 ka), a period of dramatic temperature and hydrologic changes. The results demonstrate that climatic controls on Lake Malawi vegetation are critically important to weathering processes and erosion patterns during the deglaciation. At 18 ka, afromontane forests dominated but were progressively replaced by tropical seasonal forest, as summer rainfall increased. Despite indication of decreased rainfall, drought-intolerant forest persisted through the Younger Dryas (YD) resulting from a shorter dry season. Following the YD, an intensified summer monsoon and increased rainfall seasonality were coeval with forest decline and expansion of drought-tolerant miombo woodland. Clay minerals closely track the vegetation record, with high ratios of kaolinite to smectite (K/S) indicating heavy leaching when forest predominates, despite variable rainfall. In the early Holocene, when rainfall and temperature increased (effective moisture remained low), open woodlands expansion resulted in decreased K/S, suggesting a reduction in chemical weathering intensity. Terrigenous sediment mass accumulation rates also increased, suggesting critical linkages among open vegetation and erosion during intervals of enhanced summer rainfall. This study shows a strong, direct influence of vegetation composition on weathering intensity in the tropics. As climate change will likely impact this interplay between the biosphere and geosphere, tropical landscape change could lead to deleterious effects on soil and water quality in regions with little infrastructure for mitigation.

Indoor Household Particulate Matter Measurements Using a Network of Low-cost Sensors	AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH												The World Health Organization estimates that 4.3 million deaths globally in 2012 were attributable to household air pollution, of which particulate matter (PM) with a diameter of 2.5 mu m or less (PM2.5) is a significant contributor. When integrated with a wireless network, low-cost PM measurements potentially provide personalized information on indoor concentrations in real time so that individuals can take action. The objectives of this study were to (1) deploy a network of research-grade instruments and low-cost sensors in a home environment and evaluate the performance, (2) characterize activities and conditions that increase PM concentrations, and (3) identify how these activities affect the PM levels in different rooms of a home. The wireless sensor network included low-cost PM sensors, a gateway, and a database for storing data. Based on the commercially available Dylos DC1100 Pro (Utah Modified Dylos Sensor) and Plantower PMS sensor (AirU), the low-cost sensors were compared to three research-grade instruments-the GRIMM, DustTrak, and MiniVol-in two households in Salt Lake City during summer and winter, with the results suggesting that the low-cost sensors agreed well with the DustTrak. Of the activities, frying food and spraying aerosol products generated the largest increase in PM, both in the room of the activity (the kitchen and bedroom, respectively) and the adjacent rooms. High outdoor PM concentrations during a cold air pool episode also caused indoor levels to rise. In addition, different PM sources triggered different sensor responses. Consequently, obtaining accurate estimates of the mass concentration in an indoor environment, with its wide variety of PM sources, is challenging. However, low-cost PM sensors can be incorporated into an indoor air-quality measurement network to help individuals manage their personal exposure.					; Patwari, Neal/C-7949-2009; Hegde, Shruti/AAG-5070-2019	Lundrigan, Philip/0000-0002-8276-4842; 													1680-8584	2071-1409				FEB	2020	20	2					381	394		10.4209/aaqr.2019.01.0046	http://dx.doi.org/10.4209/aaqr.2019.01.0046													WOS:000518390700014

Hydroclimatic conditions and fishing practices at Late Paleolithic Makhadma 4 (Egypt) inferred from stable isotope analysis of otoliths	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					23rd Biennial Meeting of the Society-of-the-Africanist-Archaeologist (SAfA)	JUN 26-JUL 02, 2016	Univ Jean Jaures, Toulouse, FRANCE	Soc Africanist Archaeologist	Univ Jean Jaures			The late Paleolithic site of Makhadma 4, located along the Nile River in Upper Egypt, yielded an important ichthyofauna characterized by a very high proportion of tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). We used isotopic analysis (delta O-18) of well-preserved otoliths ("ear stones") of tilapia to reconstruct the former hydrological conditions, as well as the fishing strategies of the site's inhabitants. Otoliths from two modern fish captured in the Nile River near Esna were also examined to test how accurately tilapia otoliths reflect their ambient environment. All otoliths were sequentially micromilled to recover high resolution isotopic profiles along the main growth axis. Comparison of the modern otolith profiles with environmental data shows that tilapia delta O-18 values record seasonal variations of the modern Nile hydroclimate but that their values are offset. The archaeological otoliths record very large intra-individual cyclical variations in delta O-18 values, with relatively consistent amplitude, as well as very high seasonal maximum values (up to thorn8.3%), compared with the modern otoliths. The hydrological regime of the water body in which the archaeological fish lived was characterized by a reduced Nile water inflow that could not negate the effect of local evaporation during spring. The reconstructed hydrological conditions are in accordance with a new model of Nilotic behavior that assumes the creation of lakes by damming of the Nile as a result of a high eolian activity during hyper-arid periods of the Late Pleistocene. Although large seasonal evaporation may have resulted in a severe seasonal reduction in the lake's volume and extent, the lake was, nevertheless, maintained for several years. Cyclic variations in otolith delta O-18 values permit reconstruction of the period of the hydrological cycle during which the fish were captured. Fishing of young individuals occurred mostly after the maximum input of inflow water from the Nile, when evaporitic conditions were at their lowest, i.e. during fall. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Foraminiferal species densities and environmental variables of Pulicat Lake, southeast coast of India	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA												Total (Dead + live) foraminiferal species have been studied for four seasons viz., pre monsoon (July-Sept), monsoon (Oct-Dec), post monsoon (Jan-Mar) and summer (April-June) in relation to ecological variables of Pulicat Lake. Total population ranges from 298 to 1480 / 100 gms of sediment with an average of 615 per sample. Living crop ranges from 20 to 240 / 100 gms with an average of 86 per sample for the whole lake. The lowest L/D ratio (4.3%) was noticed at station 19 in monsoon and the highest (54.7%) was recorded at station 29 in pre monsoon. There is no much significant difference in variability for all the four seasons with co-efficient of variation (CV) ranging from 41 to 46%. Out of 50 species recorded, only 35 had living representatives, while the rest occurred as dead. The prominent stained (live) species in the decreasing importance are Ammonia beccarii, A. tepida, Elphidium hispididum, Quinqueloculina agglutinans, Elphidium excavatum, Quinqueloculina hadai, Q. oblonga and Elphidium milletti. The coefficient correlation values for dissolved oxygen versus living fauna in monsoon (g = 0.33) and in summer (g = -0.26) are slightly below the significance level (g=0.36) at 95% confidence level. A high positive correlation and a high inverse relationship have been demonstrated between salinity and microbiota in monsoon and summer respectively. With the increase in organic matter fauna decreased in diversity and abundance in both the seasons. It may be concluded that in the Pulicat Lake as a whole, the environmental conditions are moderately favorable for the growth and survival of benthic foraminifera.																			0016-7622	0974-6889				NOV	2007	70	5					829	836																WOS:000252756400014

Here, we used two complementary approaches (0-diversity partitioning, and phylogenetic and functional null models) to explore the processes structuring wintering waterbird communities in the floodplain lakes of middle-lower Yangtze River (MLYR), China. We found that 1) neutral assembly might be the predominant process shaping the composition of wintering waterbird communities in MLYR; 2) compared to environmental factors, spatial variables, in particular those describing the large scale spatial structure among lakes, contributed more in explaining the functional and phylogenetic composition variations across the region, indicating dispersal constraints might strongly mediate neutral processes. The dispersal constraint could be imposed by movement barriers caused by anthropogenic landscape modification, site fidelity, or both; and 3) strong dispersal constraints could lead to competitive exclusion superimposed over neutrally assembly isolated communities, a hypothesis confirmed by the alpha-and 0-null models. These findings provide strong support for the importance of conserving and improving ecological connectivity at the regional scale as well as habitat quality enhancement at lake scale.

J	Wang, LP; Liu, LS; Zheng, BH				Wang, Liping; Liu, Lusan; Zheng, Binghui			Eutrophication development and its key regulating factors in a water-supply reservoir in North China	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												Yanghe Reservoir is an important source of drinking water for Qinhuangdao City, North China; however, in recent decades this water source has been eutrophic with recurrent summer cyanobacterial blooms. The trophic grade of the system in summer was mesotrophiceutrophic in 1990 and became hypertrophic in 2011. The nutrient availability is extremely high during the entire year, and the water temperature should be the primary driver of the summer blooms. In May October of 2010 and 2011, abrupt variations were observed in the Secchi depth (SD) and chlorophyll a (Chl-a), and both the correlated analysis of Chl-a-SD and trophic status indices (TSI) deviation (TSIchl-a-TSISD) showed that algal cell density dominated light attenuation. During the algal bloom outbreak, the microcystin concentration was found to vary between 0.35-2.12 mu g/L in 2010 and 0.11-1.86 mu g/L in 2011. The maximum microcystin content was more than two times the safety limit required for drinking water. Inflow discharges were most concentrated in the summer, with periods of lower residence time and the largest water level fluctuation over the entire year. When a high availability of nutrients promoted a high CM-a concentration in the whole system, it appeared that the instability caused by the decrease in residence time could not produce effective changes in the cyanobacterial abundance. The results indicated that nutrient enrichment in the aquatic systems of Yanghe Reservoir is the most serious problem and that the status would not been modified effectively by increasing hydrological fluctuations (e.g., decreasing the residence time). Therefore, decreasing the nutrient concentrations is the only route to improve the water quality of this reservoir.																			1001-0742	1878-7320				MAY 1	2013	25	5					962	970		10.1016/S1001-0742(12)60120-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(12)60120-X								24218826					WOS:000319635900014

Seven cloud-event samples were collected at the Puy de Dome summit, and cultivation was performed leading to the isolation of 71 bacterial, 42 fungal and 15 yeast strains. Most of the fungi isolated were of Cladosporium or Trametes affiliation, and yeasts were of Cryptococcus affiliation. Bacteria, identified on the basis of their 16S rRNA gene sequence, were found to belong to Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria (Alpha, Beta and Gamma subclasses) and Bacteroidetes phyla, and mainly to the genera Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas, Staphylococcus, Streptomyces, and Arthrobacter. These strains appear to be closely related to some bacteria described from cold environments, water (sea and freshwater), soil or vegetation. Comparison of the distribution of Gram-negative vs. Gram-positive bacteria shows that the number of Gram-negative bacteria is greater in summer than in winter. Finally, a very important result of this study concerns the ability of half of the tested strains to grow at low temperatures (5 degrees C): most of these are Gram-negative bacteria, and a few are even shown to be psychrophiles. On the whole, these results give a good picture of the microbial content of cloud water in terms of classification, and suggest that a large proportion of bacteria present in clouds have the capacity to be metabolically active there. This is of special interest with respect to the potential role of these microorganisms in atmospheric chemistry.					; Amato, Pierre/E-8912-2018; Mailhot, Gilles/ABC-7180-2020	Amato, Pierre/0000-0003-3168-0398; Laj, Paolo/0000-0002-6586-0664; 													0168-6496	1574-6941				FEB	2007	59	2					242	254		10.1111/j.1574-6941.2006.00199.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2006.00199.x								17328765					WOS:000243506800004
J	Yang, L; Zhao, JH; Hu, P; Qu, SL; Feng, GL				Yang, Liu; Zhao, Jun-Hu; Hu, Po; Qu, Shu-Lin; Feng, Guo-Lin			The Major Interannual Modes of Late-Summer Precipitation Over the Northern China Monsoon Region	ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN												Summer precipitation in the northern China monsoon region (NCMR; 35 degrees-55 degrees N, 108 degrees-135 degrees E) shows significant intraseasonal variability. The early-summer (June) and late-summer (July-August) precipitation patterns show clear differences in their formation mechanisms and the systems that affect them. We used empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis to investigate the two leading modes of July-August precipitation over the NCMR and their associated atmospheric circulation anomalies using linear regression. The results show that the first (EOF1) and second (EOF2) modes correspond to a pan-NCMR precipitation variation pattern and a precipitation oscillation pattern between North China (NC) and Northeast China (NEC), respectively. These two modes account for 22.1% and 10.1% of the total variance, respectively. The associated principal components (PCs) both have significant inter-annual variability with a period of 2-4 years. In addition, PC1 has significant interdecadal variability with a period of 20-30 years. Further analysis suggests that EOF1 and EOF2 clearly have a different relationship with the summer monsoon circulation system. In the positive phase of PC1, the East Asian subtropical westerly jet stream (EAWJS) shows a northward trend with higher intensity than normal the blocking high at mid- to high latitudes is inactive; and the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) is located to the north of its normal position. The NCMR is controlled by stronger southerly winds, which cause the convergence of water vapour, favouring more precipitation in this region and vice versa. In the positive phase of PC2, the EAWJS swings to the south of Lake Baikal. Significant positive height anomalies exist from western NC to NEC. Significant negative height anomalies occur to the subtropical northwestern Pacific. This indicates that the cold vortex in Northeast China is inactive, the WPSH tends to be weaker and located to the south of its normal position, and NEC (NC) is dominated by anomalous northeasterly (southeasterly) winds. The convergence (divergence) of water vapour in NC (NEC) favours more (less) precipitation in NC (NEC) and vice versa. Therefore, EOF1 is related to the large-scale circulation anomalies over East Asia and the northwest Pacific in July and August, whereas EOF2 is more closely related to the anomalies in the regional circulation over the NCMR and the subtropical northwestern Pacific.																			0705-5900	1480-9214					2019	57	4					295	306		10.1080/07055900.2019.1670612	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07055900.2019.1670612													WOS:000620695300004

ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Artificial water-level fluctuations (WLF) seriously threaten the biodiversity and functioning of littoral zones in lake ecosystems. The use of artificial floating islands (AFI) to compensate for the deleterious effects of WLF on littoral habitats has been of increasing interest to environmental managers. Yet, the ecological efficiency of this solution is still very poorly documented. AFI are usually designed as simple vegetated floating mats. In this study, we designed an artificial Floating Littoral Zone (FLOLIZ), which mimics a natural littoral zone composed of a terrestrial section vegetated with helophytes and several underwater levels containing soil and hydrophytes. Next, we aimed to assess the effectiveness of FLOLIZ in supporting macroinvertebrate communities. Three FLOLIZs were installed in three bays of a French hydroelectric reservoir marked by high WLF. Taxonomic and functional metrics of macroinvertebrate communities in the three FLOLIZs were compared with control littoral stations over four seasons of one year. The cumulated abundance, taxonomic richness and diversity were significantly higher in the FLOLIZs than in the control littoral stations, particularly when water level rose abruptly (i.e., in spring) and during the post-drawdown season (i.e., in summer). Functional profiles of macroinvertebrate communities significantly differed between FLOLIZs and control littoral stations. More specifically, communities in littoral control stations were dominated by highly mobile and resistant taxa (e.g., Beetles, Bugs, Chironomids), while communities in the FLOLIZs were dominated by less mobile species with longer life cycles (e.g., Hydra sp., Oligochaeta). These findings show that FLOLIZs were more successfully colonized by original, diversified, and abundant macroinvertebrate communities with respect to littoral control stations. These preliminary results suggest that FLOLIZs could provide suitable, biogenic habitats for macroinvertebrates in reservoirs exhibiting high WLF. Longer term monitoring, including of other compartments than macroinvertebrates (e.g., fish), could provide additional evidence that FLOLIZs mitigate the deleterious effects of high WLF on aquatic biodiversity.					; westrelin, samuel/JEO-8076-2023	COLAS, FANNY/0000-0002-5485-6715; SALMON, Quentin/0000-0003-0151-0208; 													0925-8574	1872-6992				MAR	2022	176								106509	10.1016/j.ecoleng.2021.106509	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2021.106509													WOS:000807886600002

AMC has been suggested to be an important mineral,a major process of CO2 fixation in alkaline saline lakes.Understanding the role of AMC for carbon fixation in alkaline lakesrequires knowledge of the solubility of AMC under the full range ofrelevant environmental conditions, but its solubility is poorly knownfor low water temperatures. In this study, the solubility of AMC at7 degrees C was measured in laboratory experiments and compared withchemical analyses of water samples from Olgoy Lake, a natural alkalinesaline lake in Mongolia. Laboratory measurements using both supersaturationand undersaturation methods provided very similar solubility productsof AMC (log K (sp) = -5.20 +/- 0.02) at 7 degrees C, which was markedly higher than the solubilityproduct at 25 degrees C (log K (sp) =-5.59). The temperature dependence of the solubility of AMCis much greater than that of monohydrocalcite, another important authigeniccalcium carbonate in alkaline lakes. Analyses of water from OlgoyLake consistently showed a significant temperature dependency of ionactivity products with respect to magnesium carbonate. The relativelyhigh solubility of AMC at low temperatures implies that the formationof AMC requires relatively high concentrations of dissolved componentsin lakes. Our results suggest that the formation of AMC is favoredmore in summer than in winter.

On the slopes of megadunes in the desert, there are physical and chemical deposits produced by surface runoff. In addition, we have observed rarely-seen infiltration-excess surface runoff in the megadune depressions as well as spring streams at the base of megadunes. We used electron microscopy, energy spectrum analysis, infiltration experiments, moisture content determinations and grain-size analysis to study the mineral and chemical composition of the runoff precipitates, and grain-size of the deposits associated with the runoff, together with the hydrological balance in the megadune area, and the atmospheric precipitation mechanism responsible for groundwater recharge and for supplying water to lakes. The observations of shallow runoff and infiltration-excess surface runoff indicate the occurrence of strong and effective precipitation in summer, which would provide an important source for groundwater recharge. Several lines of evidence, such as the physical and chemical deposits resulting from shallow subsurface runoff, spring streams, infiltration-excess runoff, and gravity capillary water with a moisture content of 3-6%, demonstrate that precipitation reaches the base of the megadunes through infiltration and subsequently becomes groundwater. The chemical deposits, such as newly-formed calcite and gypsum, and gray-black physical deposits, as well as different stages in the development of fan-shaped landforms resulting from shallow subsurface runoff, indicate that groundwater recharge in the area is the result of long-term precipitation, rather than intermittent individual major rainfall events. Fine sand layers with a low infiltration capacity lead to subsurface runoff emerging at the ground surface. Five factors play an important role in maintaining a positive water balance and in replenishing groundwater via rainfall: effective rainfall as a water source, the high infiltration capacity of the sands enabling rainfall to rapidly become capillary water in the dunes, low evapotranspiration rates due to the sparse vegetation, the fact that the depth of the sand layer influenced by evaporation is shallow enough to maximize the deep infiltration of rainfall, and rapidly-moving gravity capillary water in the sandy dunes. These five factors together constitute a mechanism for groundwater recharge from rainfall, and explain the origin of the groundwater and lakes in the area. Our findings represent a significant advance in research on the hydrological cycle, including groundwater recharge conditions and recharge mechanisms, in this desert region.					shao, tianjie/AGK-6783-2022; Zeng, Xiaolong/KHD-7133-2024; Ma, Yandong/H-6903-2016														1674-7313	1869-1897				APR	2017	60	4			SI		707	719		10.1007/s11430-016-9019-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11430-016-9019-2													WOS:000400551300009
J	Ashworth, AC; Nelson, RE				Ashworth, Allan C.; Nelson, Robert E.			The paleoenvironment of the Olympia beds based on fossil beetles from Discovery Park, Seattle, Washington, USA	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Two fossil insect assemblages with ages of 17,959 and 19,786 cal BP are reported from cross-laminated silts and sands within the Olympia beds at Magnolia Bluff, Discovery Park, Seattle, Washington (N 47 degrees 39', W 122 degrees 25'). The silts accumulated during MIS 2 at a time when the Puget Lobe of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet was advancing southward. Eventually the Olympia beds were buried sequentially by lacustrine beds, outwash sands and gravels and finally till. The depositional environment based on paleoecology and sedimentary facies was a floodplain of a large braided river. The fossils are disarticulated skeletal parts representing a diverse fauna of 132 beetle species, all extant. The habitats represented by fossils include sparsely vegetated sand and gravel bars (Opisthius richardsoni), open muddy areas (Elaphrus californicus), and vegetation-shaded banks (Elaphrus clairvillei and Elaphrus purpurans). Outside of the floodplain, the habitat was grassland (Carabus taedatus) with occasional stands of coniferous trees indicated by scolytids (bark beetles). Large mammals probably used the river as awatering hole, based on the abundance of dung-feeding Aphodiinae (scarabs) and staphylinid beetles (Tachinus). Most of the beetle species have modern geographic ranges which include northern Washington State. Notably, however, species characteristic of the temperate rainforest of the Pacific Northwest are absent. For the older of the two fossil assemblages, mean summer temperature is estimated to be 17 degrees C, or similar to Seattle today. The climate was more continental and winters would have been colder than at Seattle today. The occurrence of the northern species Pelophila borealis and Olophrum boreale in the younger of the two assemblages indicates a colder climate estimated to represent a lowering of mean summer temperature by 1-2 degrees C. The climatic cooling is possibly associated with the advance of the Puget Lobe. Both pollen and fossil beetle evidence are in agreement that there was less available moisture, possibly one half of today's precipitation. Palynologists have referred to the MIS 2 vegetation as tundra, cold steppe, or subarctic parkland. None of the Discovery Park fossils are obligate tundra species, and because the majority of taxa have ranges which overlap in northern Washington State today, we prefer to use the term prairie for the temperate to cold-temperate MIS 2 grassland.

The area of study was Lake Serwy, located in northeastern Poland. Two artificial neural network (ANN) multilayer perceptron (MLP) and multiple linear regression (MLR) models were built. The following explanatory variables were considered: maximal and minimal temperature (Tmax, Tmin) wind speed (WS), vertical circulation (VC) and water level from previous periods (WL). Additionally, a binary variable describing the period of the year (winter, summer) has been considered in one of the two MLP and MLR models. The forecasting models have been assessed based on selected criteria: mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean squared error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2) and mean biased error. Considering their values and absolute deviations from observed values it was concluded that the ANN model using an additional binary variable (MLP_B+) has the best forecasting performance. Absolute deviations from observed values were the determining factor which made this model the most efficient. In the case of the MLP_B+ model, those values were about 10% lower than in other models. The conducted analyses indicated good performance of ANN networks as a forecasting tool for relatively small lakes located in temperate climate zones. It is acknowledged that they enable water level forecasting with greater precision and lower absolute deviations than the use of multiple linear regression models.

H.; Scherer, Dieter			Prominent Midlatitude Circulation Signature in High Asia's Surface Climate During Monsoon	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												High Asia has experienced strong environmental changes in recent decades, as evident in records of glaciers, lakes, tree rings, and vegetation. The multiscale understanding of the climatic drivers, however, is still incomplete. In particular, few systematic assessments have evaluated to what degree, if at all, the midlatitude westerly circulation modifies local surface climates in the reach of the Indian Summer Monsoon. This paper shows that a southward shift of the upper-tropospheric westerlies contributes significantly to climate variability in the core monsoon season (July-September) by two prominent dipole patterns at the surface: cooling in the west of High Asia contrasts with warming in the east, while moist anomalies in the east and northwest occur with drying along the southwestern margins. Circulation anomalies help to understand the dipoles and coincide with shifts in both the westerly wave train and the South Asian High, which imprint on air mass advection and local energy budgets. The relation of the variabilities to a well-established index of midlatitude climate dynamics allows future research on climate proxies to include a fresh hypothesis for the interpretation of environmental changes.					; Maussion, Fabien/B-9814-2013; Mölg, Thomas/I-8131-2013; Chiang, John/AAK-6169-2021	Collier, Emily/0000-0001-7314-3000; Moelg, Thomas/0000-0001-8029-8887; Scherer, Dieter/0000-0002-3670-0864; Maussion, Fabien/0000-0002-3211-506X; Chiang, John/0000-0001-7723-9544; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				DEC 16	2017	122	23					12702	12712		10.1002/2017JD027414	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017JD027414													WOS:000419396500026

Initiation of turion formation on lateral and terminal stem apices occurred in Sept. or Oct. and the turions then elongated gradually, becoming heavier during Oct. and Nov. During the winter, turions became less buoyant and by April had sunk to the bottom and assumed the U-shape characteristic of the base of plants grown from turions. Turions remained attached to the previous season''s growth until released by decay of the parent plant. No abscission layer at the base of turions was found. It was the onset of turion formation and the prolonged period of turion dormancy that limited the growing season of M. exalbescens. A winter vernalization period for turions appeared to be essential for normal plant development the following season.																			0304-3770	1879-1522					1979	6	4					357	363		10.1016/0304-3770(79)90074-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(79)90074-3													WOS:A1979HT40700004

Metals and trace elements are among the most common causes of these teratological forms. Metal enrichment in water bodies can be attributed to the geological setting of the area or to pollution. The widespread benthic diatom Achnanthidium minutissimum (ADMI) is one of the most metal-tolerant species. In the present study, ADMI teratologies were defined from samples taken from eight very diverse, widely-distributed inlandwater habitats: streams affected by active and abandoned mining areas, a metal-contaminated stream, a spring in an old chalcopyrite mine, a mineral-water fountain, and a sediment core taken from a lake affected by metal contamination in the past. Deformed frustules of ADMI were characterised mainly by one (sometimes two) more or less bent offending, conferring to the specimens a cymbelloid outline (cymbellidinum-like teratology, CLT). Marked teratologies were distinguished from slight deformities. Hydrochemical analyses, including metals and trace elements, were carried out and enrichment factors (EF) relative to average crustal composition were calculated. To improve-our knowledge-on-the potential of different metals and trace elements to trigger the occurrence of ADMI CLT, we carefully selected 15 springs out of 110 (CRENODAT dataset) where both ADMI and above-average metal or metalloid concentrations occurred, and re-analysed these samples. The results from the eight widely-distributed core sites as well as from the 15 selected CRENODAT springs led to the hypothesis that two metals (copper and zinc) and a metalloid (antimony) were the most likely triggers of ADMI CLT formation. From a quantitative point of view, it is worth noting that the lowest concentrations triggering ADMI CLT can be fairly low, particularly in the case of copper contamination. The antimony-rich site was characterised by a marked-teratology variant where both ends of ADMI were bent off. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J	Carter, VA; Shinker, JJ; Preece, J				Carter, Vachel A.; Shinker, Jacqueline J.; Preece, Jonathon			Drought and vegetation change in the central Rocky Mountains and western Great Plains: potential climatic mechanisms associated with megadrought conditions at 4200 cal yr BP	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Droughts are a naturally re-occurring phenomena that result in economic and societal losses. Yet, the most historic droughts that occurred in the 1930s and 1950s in the Great Plains and western United States were both shorter in duration and less severe than megadroughts that have plagued the region in the past. Roughly 4200 years ago, a similar to 150-year long megadrought occurred in the central Rocky Mountains, as indicated by sedimentary pollen evidence documenting a brief and unique change in vegetation composition from Long Lake, southeastern Wyoming. Neighbouring the central Rocky Mountains, several dune fields reactivated in the western Great Plains around this time period illustrating a severe regional drought. While sedimentary pollen provides evidence of past drought, paleoecological evidence does not provide context for the climate mechanisms that may have caused the drought. Thus, a modern climate analogue technique was applied to the sedimentary pollen and regional dune reactivation evidence identified from the region to provide a conceptual framework for exploring possible mechanisms responsible for the observed ecological changes. The modern climate analogues of 2002/2012 illustrate that warm and dry conditions persisted through the growing season and were associated with anomalously higher-than-normal geopotential heights centred over the Great Plains. In the spring, higher-than-normal heights suppressed moisture transport via the low-level jet from the Gulf of Mexico creating a more southwesterly component of flow. In the summer, higher-than-normal heights persisted over the northern Great Plains resulting in a wind shift with an easterly component of flow, drawing in dry continental air into the study region. In both cases, lower-than-normal moisture in the atmosphere (via 850mbar specific humidity) inhibited uplift and potential precipitation. Thus, if the present scenario existed during the 4.2 ka drought, the associated climatic responses are consistent with local and regional proxy data suggesting regional drought conditions in the central Rocky Mountains and western Great Plains.					; Carter, Kraklow, Vachel/A-8583-2018; Carter, Vachel/P-6884-2019	Preece, Jonathon/0000-0002-4463-7770; Carter, Kraklow, Vachel/0000-0002-0610-0091; 													1814-9324	1814-9332				AUG 15	2018	14	8					1195	1212		10.5194/cp-14-1195-2018	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-14-1195-2018													WOS:000441623800002

Weekly or daily measurements may miss some important events in the hydrodynamic process, resulting in inaccurate evaluations of the impacts of hydrodynamics on phytoplankton. In this study, high-frequency (15-min interval) measurements were used to analyze the effect of water column stability on surface chlorophyll a (Chl a) and lag time under different nutrient backgrounds during a cyanobacterial bloom in the Three Gorges Reservoir, China. Cross-correlation analysis between the relative water column stability (RWCS) and Chl a was performed at different stages. The results showed that the RWCS above the euphotic depth influenced the surface Chl a concentration most significantly. A lower RWCS (<20) limited the increase in the Chl a concentration, and a higher RWCS caused a significant increase in Chl a only when nutrients were not limited (TN/TP < 29) and light and temperature conditions were suitable. It took a short time for a higher RWCS to significantly increase the surface Chl a concentration compared with a lower RWCS. When the waterbody had a very low Chl a concentration (almost 0), approximately 2 days were needed to significantly increase the Chl a concentration, while approximately only half an hour was needed when the background concentration of Chl a was slightly higher. During the bloom period, a decline in the RWCS significantly decreased the Chl a in a very short time (approximately half an hour). Reducing the water column stability could be a good approach to control cyanobacterial blooms.					; XU, Yaoyang/J-9809-2012; Cai, Qinghua/F-8176-2015	QU, Xiaodong/0000-0002-4090-4982; Zhipan, Niu/0000-0001-8679-382X; Cai, Qinghua/0000-0002-0224-7256; 													2073-4441					JUL	2019	11	7							1504	10.3390/w11071504	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11071504													WOS:000480632300189

A variety of benthic microbial mats develop within these creeks. The composition of these microbial communities has not been studied in detail. In this report, clone libraries of bacterial and cyanobacterial 16S rRNA genes were used to describe the microbial community structure of four mats near a shoreline of Drake Passage. Samples were collected from four microbial mats, two at an early developmental stage (December) and two collected latter in late summer (April). Sequence analysis showed that filamentous Cyanobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Betaproteobacteria were the most abundant ribotypes. Diversity indices were comparable for the four mats. Bacterial libraries from mat samples collected in December represented primarily Alphaproteobacterial and Betaproteobacterial ribotypes. In contrast, filamentous Cyanobacteria as well as Alphaproteobacteria were most abundant in libraries derived from samples collected in April. Differences in relative abundances may reflect the succession of microbial communities during the austral summer. Composition of cyanobacterial orders in bacterial libraries obtained from mats collected in late summer were different compared with their corresponding cyanobacterial libraries. This may be the result of divergence in primer specificities. Nostocales, Oscillatoriales, and Synechococcales orders were the dominant ribotypes represented in cyanobacterial libraries. Some taxa of cyanobacteria identified using this strategy coincided with previous studies of others in the same region using microscopic techniques. Future work should combine microscopy, culture-dependent and culture-independent strategies to better describe microbial mats in maritime Antarctica.

In this study, we investigated the episodic acidification of a stream at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire with high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and naturally occurring organic acids. We studied three events in 2001: spring snowmelt, which occurred from 6 April to 14 May and resulted in two distinct melt events; and two rain events, one on 17 June and the other on 17 July. During snowmelt events organic acids were a minor contributor to the short-term acidification of stream water, with increases in NO3- and dilution of base cations being the dominant mechanisms. During summer rainfall events, however, increases in inputs of organic acids were the dominant mechanism of episodic acidification when soil water was the dominant contributor to stream discharge (59 to 66% of peak stream discharge). We also found that precipitation events occurring after relatively wet antecedent conditions (17 July event) resulted in more severe acid episodes than events that followed drier antecedent conditions (17 June event). The minimum acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) was only -19 mueq l(-1) for the 17 June event, whereas the minimum ANC for the 17 July event was much lower (-62 mueq l(-1)) although the total rainfall amount was similar for the two events.

J	Gierlowski-Kordesch, EH				Gierlowski-Kordesch, EH			Carbonate deposition in an ephemeral siliciclastic alluvial system: Jurassic Shuttle Meadow Formation, Newark Supergroup, Hartford Basin, USA	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY					1st Limno-Geological Congress on Research and Methods in Methods in Ancient and Modern Lacustrine Basins	AUG 21-25, 1995	COPENHAGEN, DENMARK					Nonmarine carbonate accumulation, from a sedimentologic perspective, has multiple possible origins: elastic load, springs, groundwater discharge, soil development, biochemical seasonal changes, cave speleothems, and eolian influx. Many of these carbonates contain diagnostic textures from which origin is easy to ascertain. However, differentiating between elastic and spring/groundwater carbonates, especially in depositional systems dominated by siliciclastics, is not always simple; here criteria for recognition are developed. Subsurface hydrology and tectonic origin of the depositional basin, source rocks surrounding the basin, sedimentologic packaging and extent of the carbonates in question, as well as their sedimentary structures and fossil content, and stable isotopic analyses of the carbonates can all aid in determining carbonate origin and correctly assessing sedimentary and basin evolution. The present study focuses on a nonmarine carbonate deposit found within the Jurassic Shuttle Meadow Formation of the Hartford Basin, one of many rift basins which formed as a result of the opening of the North Atlantic Ocean during the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic. The upper 50 m of the formation at Plainville, Connecticut, is interpreted as continental in origin and is composed of five facies: red ripple cross-laminated muddy siltstones to sandstones (Fr, Sr), massive red siliciclastic mudstones (Fm), buff fine- to medium-grained horizontally laminated sandstones (Sh), red to white disrupted calcareous shales (Fl(3)), and rare micritic carbonates (Pm). Facies Fr, Sr, Sh, and Fm are interpreted as an alluvial plain system in an ephemeral setting with bedload sheetflooding as the dominant depositional mechanism, similar to the Channel Country drainage system of central Australia. In addition, preservation of lateral accretion sandstone sheets (accretionary benches) indicate that the Shuttle Meadow alluvial system was rapidly accreting. The anomalous existence of carbonate beds tin Facies Fl(3) and Pm) in the SMF bedload-dominated siliciclastic sequence is attributed mainly to the unique nature of the elastic sediment load in the basin; no direct evidence for a spring/groundwater input is apparent. The shallow carbonate lake margin or a pond with vegetation and periodic exposure is envisioned as the depositional environment. The intraclastic texture of the micrites with rare primary relict lamination indicates early diagenetic alteration from root penetration, desiccation cracks, and burrowing.

This study was conducted in such seasonally ice-covered lake (Lake Limnopolar, Byers Peninsula, Livingston Is., Antarctica), which exhibits a microbial dominated pelagic food web. An important feature is also the occurrence of benthic mosses (Drepanocladus longifolius) covering the lake bottom. Plankton dynamics were investigated during the ice-thawing transition to the summer maximum. Both bacterioplankton and viral-like particles were higher near the lake's bottom, suggesting a benthic support. When the lake was under dim conditions because of the snow-and-ice cover, autotrophic picoplankters dominated at deep layers. The taxaspecific photopigments indicated dominance of picocyanobacteria among them when the light availability was lower. By contrast, larger and less edible phytoplankton dominated at the onset of the ice melting. The plankton size spectra were fitted to the continuous model of Pareto distribution. Spectra evolved similarly at two sampled depths, in surface and near the bottom, with slopes increasing until mid-January. However, slopes were less steep (i.e., size classes more uniformly distributed) at the bottom, thus denoting a more efficient utilization of resources. These findings suggest that microbial loop pathways in the lake are efficiently channelized during some periods to the metazoan production (mainly the copepod Boeckella poppei). Our results point to that trophic interactions may still occur in these lakes despite environmental harshness. This results of interest in a framework of increasing temperatures that may reduce the climatic restrictions and therefore stimulate biotic interactions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR.

Therefore, in Lake Buritis, which is a leisure area for the population of the city of Goiatuba, Goias, Brazil, the quality of the water was analyzed, carrying out quantitative tests of the water samples at six different points between the source and the outlet of the lake that flows into the stream, Chico A Toa. Physical-chemical tests (turbidity, pH, alkalinity, electrical conductivity, color, nitrate and hardness parameters), microbiological tests for species identification, analysis of the antimicrobial susceptibility profile, metals analysis and Allium cepa test, were performed. The total coliforms number in water samples was higher than the maximum value established by Brazilian legislation, demonstrating high fecal contamination during the spring in samples from an artesian well. The bacterial diversity found was large and there were many pathogenic bacteria. The A. cepa test demonstrated a cytotoxic potential for water from the source and outlet of Buritis Lake. Statistical tests were applied to verify existing correlations between parameters. Among the analyzed data, the highest correlation was between the color and turbidity parameters and the grouping between the metals (lead, iron, cadmium and magnesium).

Year-Round Presence of Microcystins and Toxin-Producing Microcystis in the Water Column and Ice Cover of a Eutrophic Lake Located in the Continuous Permafrost Zone (Yakutia, Russia)	TOXINS												This study aimed to test the hypothesis of the year-round presence of toxigenic Microcystis and cyanotoxins in the water and ice of the shallow eutrophic Lake Ytyk-Kyuyol located in the continuous permafrost zone. Three independent approaches-mass-spectrometry, molecular methods and light microscopy-were applied in the study. The cyanobacterial biomass ranged from 1.0 x 10(-4) to 4.8 mg L-1. Microcystis flos-aquae and M. aeruginosa were the dominant morphospecies in plankton throughout the observation. In environmental DNA, the presence of M. aeruginosa was supported and mcy gene regions responsible for microcystin biosynthesis were detected through a BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) search and phylogenetic estimation based on newly obtained 16S rRNA, 16S-23S ITS rRNA, mcyA and mcyE nucleotide sequences. The intracellular microcystin concentration ranged from <0.1 to 803 ng L-1, and the microcystin quota in the Microcystis biomass was extremely low. For the first time, it was shown that Microcystis cells containing mcy genes and microcystins presented permanently in the water column, both during the ice-free period and under ice, as well as inside thick ice covers within 7 months of severe winter. We hypothesized that minor pelagic and ice populations of Microcystis could participate in increasing cell density in the spring. However, further studies are needed to confirm the viability of the overwintering Microcystis colonies in the water and inside the ice of Lake Ytyk-Kyuyol.

J	Heinen, EA; McManus, J				Heinen, EA; McManus, J			Carbon and nutrient cycling at the sediment-water boundary in western Lake Superior	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Organic carbon and nutrient settling rates, benthic recycling rates, and material burial rates were measured in the western arm of Lake Superior. Organic carbon settling rates, measured using particle- intercepting sediment traps, averaged 2.3 mmol m(-2) day(-1) over the course of the experiment. Measured particle settling fluxes exhibit a minimum during winter and a maximum during spring. Sediment oxygen uptake rates measured throughout the basin average 2.2 +/- 0.8 mmol m(-2) day(-1) (n = 16) and nitrate, soluble reactive phosphorus, and silicic acid efflux rates average 0. 15 +/- 0.07 (n = 25), 0.005 +/- 0.006 (n = 23), and 1.34 +/- 0.4 mmol m(-2) day(-1) (n = 26), respectively. Sediment solid-phase, particle settling rate, and benthic efflux data demonstrate that organic carbon, nitrogen, and biogenic silica are recycled at the sediment-water interface with an efficiency of similar to 60% or greater in western Lake Superior. In contrast to these constituents, phosphorus recycling efficiency is lowest at sites close to the two major river inputs of (similar to 10%) and highest at our deepest site (similar to 40%). Despite these low recycling efficiencies for phosphorus, the benthic flux of phosphorous is an essential and dominant component to the lake's annual internal budget contributing similar to 50% of the total annual phosphorus inputs to the water column.

A solution has been found in a design to build an exotic restaurant and conference facility in two caverns excavated into the rock slope of the nearby hill of Huhmarisvaara, overlooking Lake Hoytiainen. The clientele is envisaged as consisting mainly of companies and organizations, but the facility could also be used for private functions. The restaurant is designed for 70 persons and the conference and sauna facilities for 50 persons. Each cavern will have an average width of 12 m, and the height of the roof arch will be 5 m, to give the rooms a feeling of spaciousness. The lighting in the restaurant and conference facilities will be indirect, i.e. the roof and walls will be illuminated as required. The kitchen is designed for preparing meals on location, with sufficient storage space for food supplies. The sauna section is grouped around a "relaxation room" which has a pool in the centre. The surface coverings and materials will be of a high standard, with signs of real craftsmanship to be seen everywhere. The facade will be of glass, providing a view of Lake Hoytiainen through the trees. Access for pedestrians and service vehicles will be via a narrow road cut into the hillside. The materials and structural solutions have been chosen with the aim of concealing the whole building in the hill as far as possible, so that it will be small and inconspicuous when viewed from the lake but much more impressive inside. Work began on site in the autumn of 2000, and the building will be ready for use in the summer of 2001.																					90-2651-821-8				2001							697	699																WOS:000169876300114

Combined investigation of the current water and P budgets of a 70 ha lake (Norreso, Fyn, Denmark) in a clayey till-dominated landscape and of the lake's Holocene trophic history demonstrates a potential significance of geogenic (natural) groundwater-borne P. Nor reso receives water from nine streams, a groundwater-fed spring located on a small island, and precipitation. The lake loses water by evaporation and via a single outlet. Monthly measurements of stream, spring, and outlet discharge, and of tracers in the form of temperature, delta O-18 and delta H-2 of water, and water chemistry were conducted. The tracers indicated that the lake receives groundwater from an underlying regional confined glaciofluvial sand aquifer via the spring and one of the streams. In addition, the lake receives a direct groundwater input (estimated as the water balance residual) via the lake bed, as supported by the artesian conditions of underlying strata observed in piezometers installed along the lake shore and in wells tapping the regional confined aquifer. The groundwater in the regional confined aquifer was anoxic, ferrous, and contained 4-5 mu mol/L dissolved inorganic orthophosphate (DIP). Altogether, the data indicated that groundwater contributes from 64% of the water-borne external DIP loading to the lake, and up to 90% if the DIP concentration of the spring, as representative for the average DIP of the regional confined aquifer, is assigned to the estimated groundwater input. In support, paleolimnological data retrieved from sediment cores indicated that Norreso was never P-poor, even before the introduction of agriculture at 6000 years before present. Accordingly, groundwater-borne geogenic phosphorus can have an important influence on the trophic state of recipient surface water ecosystems, and groundwater-borne P can be a potentially important component of the terrestrial P cycle.

Tributary discharge, lake circulation and lake biology as drivers of water quality in the Canadian Nearshore of Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A combination of data from shipboard and deployed sensors, nutrient and major ion concentration data, and tributary discharge and current data was used to assess water quality patterns on the Canadian nearshore of Lake Ontario in 2008 and the factors that impact these patterns. Mixing areas at tributary mouths were characterized by high spatial and temporal variability in water quality. Conductivity at sensors offshore from tributaries was variably correlated with discharge, with the correspondence most evident during high spring flow. Tracers of land runoff were positively correlated with tributary discharge at three of five study locations. The spatial distribution of water quality was strongly influenced by the predominating alongshore circulations, with gradients frequently observed parallel to the shoreline away from tributary mouths. Upwelling, evident from temperature bands along the coastline, periodically created onshore-offshore gradients in chlorophyll a and dissolved inorganic nitrogen. Lake whiting, starting in July, further enhanced the effect of upwelling by accentuating differences in water clarity, suspended solids, and ionic composition between surface and bottom strata. In general, turbidity decreased and water clarity increased with lake depth. Gradients in water clarity and chlorophyll a suggestive of dreissenid mussel feeding were uncommon. Interacting land- and lake-based factors contributed to heterogeneous water quality over the coastline of Lake Ontario highlighting needs for water resource assessment methods sensitive to the temporal and spatial scales of problems as well as the connectivity between the land and the lake.

Rapid vegetation response to Lateglacial and early Holocene climatic fluctuation in the South Carpathian Mountains (Romania)	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												High-resolution pollen, conifer stomata and plant macrofossil analyses of two glacial lake sediments (1740 and 1990 m a.s.l..) are used to reconstruct Lateglacial (LG) and early Holocene (EH) vegetation and tree line changes in the Retezat Mountains. Our results show that during the LG, tree line was between 1750 and 1800 m a.s.l. formed by Lath decidua, Pinus mugo and Picea abies. Early LG spread to high altitudes suggests refugia of these tree species in the mountain. The Younger Dryas cooling resulted in regional steppe-tundra expansion, but tree line position and composition showed little change. The abundance of trees and shrubs decreased at 1740 m a.s.l., but species richness increased with the arrival of Pinus cembra. Our data support climate-model hindcasts for only modest decrease in accumulated growing season heat at mid-high altitudes. Regionally the pollen records suggest enhanced aridity and seasonality. In the EH, tree line reached 2000 m a.s.l. (higher than today) by similar to 11,100 cal yr BP. P. mugo, P. cembra, P. abies established around the upper lake suggesting rapid increase in summer temperatures. The EH maximum of L decidua between 11,200-10,600 cal yr BP was connected to high summer insolation. High altitude expansion of Abies alba between 10,600-10,300 cal yr BP suggested summer mean temperatures similar to 2.8 degrees C higher then today. In comparison with other mountain sites in Europe, LG interstadial tree line was at similar altitude in the S Alps and similar to 350 m higher in the Pirin Mountains. LG tree line fluctuation had similar low amplitude in the SE Alps, Retezat and Pirin Mts suggesting relatively weak influence of the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation changes on growing season temperatures.

Aquatic ecosystems in Northern Europe are expected to face increases in temperature and water colour (TB) in future. While effects of these factors have been studied separately, it is unknown whether and how a combination of them might affect phenological events and trophic interactions. 2. In a mesocosm study, we combined both factors to create conditions expected to arise during the coming century. We focused on quantifying effects on timing and magnitude of plankton spring phenological events and identifying possible mismatches between resources (phytoplankton) and consumers (zooplankton). 3. We found that the increases in TB had important effects on timing and abundance of different plankton groups. While increased temperature led to an earlier peak in phytoplankton and zooplankton and a change in the relative timing of different zooplankton groups, increased water colour reduced chlorophyll-a concentrations. 4. Increased TB together benefitted cladocerans and calanoid copepods and led to stronger top-down control of algae by zooplankton. There was no sign of a mismatch between primary producers and grazers as reported from other studies. 5. Our results point towards an earlier onset of plankton spring growth in shallow lakes in future with a stronger top-down control of phytoplankton by zooplankton grazers.					; Hansson, Lars-Anders/HCI-2735-2022	Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317; Persson, Anders/0000-0001-5961-3651													0046-5070	1365-2427				APR	2012	57	4					684	695		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2012.02733.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2012.02733.x													WOS:000301227000005

Waters of Hanczanska Bay and the areas adjoing Wigry Lake	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES												This work comprises the results of examinations of a number of indicator bacteria on the degree of pollution (TVC 20 degreesC, TVC 37 degreesC), sanitary state (TC, FC, FS), and usefulness for recreation of Hanczanska Bay and areas adjoining Wigry Lake. Adequate studies were made in 1997, a year after the start of 3rd degree sewage treatment in the Wastewater Treatment Plant in Suwalki. Air of these bacteria in general were more numerous in the water of Hanczanska Bay, especially in spring-summer. In the waters of northern Ploso of Wigry Lake numbers of bacteria were only periodically numerous at some water samples. The highest percentage of pure water samples fulfilling the requirement for bathing waters was found at sites on the border between Hanczanska Bay and the waters of Northern Ploso of Wigry Lake; the lowest percentage was found at sites in Hanczanska Bay. Gradual decrease of TVC 20 degreesC ( sometimes 37 degreesC) with the distance from the mouth of the Czarna Hancza River towards south-east sites shows this direction of the movement of main water masses of the Czarna Hancza River. No significant differences in percentage of unpolluted water samples stated in Hanczanska Bay and areas adjoing Wigry Lake with a comparison of data from 1994-1996 years of investigation.																			1230-1485						2001	10	3					167	174																WOS:000168961600006

Based on morphological and molecular analyses of the partial LSU rDNA gene, we identified four species of monogeneans, Cichlidogyrus tilapiae, C. thurstonae, C. mbirizei, and Scutogyrus longicornis on the gills of O. niloticus, whereas individuals of C. rendalli were infested only with C. papernastrema. This is the first record of C. mbirizei and C. papernastrema in tilapias from Brazil. The ecological consequences of the introduction of exotic species of tilapia such as O. niloticus and C. rendalli along with their monogenean parasites in a wild environment represented by a river spring are discussed.

To test these hypotheses, we measured mean temperature and short-term (<2 days) temporal variability in water temperature at 23 shallow littoral sites in four basins of Lake Opeongo, Ontario, Canada. Water temperature in the littoral zone was most variable, both spatially and temporally, in the spring. Spring water temperature differed by as much as 7-15 degreesC among littoral sites in different basins (median difference among sites = 2-4 degreesC). Downwind sites were generally warmer and had more constant temperature than upwind sites, but the magnitude of these differences varied among basins of different sizes and shapes. Simple calculations of growth rates and of fish hatching times suggest that the observed variability in water temperature would result in differences in the productivity of different portions of the littoral zone.

J	Eary, LE				Eary, LE			Predicting the effects of evapoconcentration on water quality in mine pit lakes	JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION					4th International Symposium on Environmental Geochemistry (4th ISEG)	OCT 05-10, 1997	VAIL, COLORADO	US Geol Survey, AEG, Soc Environm Geochem & Hlth, Int Assoc Geochem & Cosmochem				For mine pit lakes that are hydrologic sinks, evapoconcentration can be an important process affecting long-term water quality. Based on the concept of chemical divides, pit lakes may be categorized according to the ratio of Ca to alkalinity. Lakes with 2m(Ca) < m(alkalinity) can be expected to evolve to alkaline pH, Na-HCO3-CO3-(+/-SO4)-(+/-Cl)-dominated solutions. Most predictions of long-term chemistry for pit lakes fall into this first category. Lakes with 2m(Ca) > m(alkalinity) will to evolve to near-neutral pH, Ca-Na-(+/-SO4)-(+/-Cl)-dominated solutions. Most existing pit lakes fall into the second category. This comparison suggests that the models used for predicting long-term pit lake chemistry may overestimate rates of alkalinity-generating processes. The distinction between the two evapoconcentration pathways is important for predicting the concentrations of trace constituents, such as As and Se, that ape often chemicals of concern for eco-risk assessments. Pit lakes falling into the first category can reach pH > 9, at which anionic As and Se species are not adsorbed, hence accumulate in solution over time. Pit lakes falling into the second category remain at near-neutral pH, under which most of the anionic As and Se species are adsorbed, hence do not accumulate in solution. Observations of solute compositions in existing pit lakes combined with consideration of evapoconcentration pathways in natural lakes can provide useful analogies for understanding the long-term chemical evolution of pit lakes.

J	Arp, G; Hofmann, J; Reitner, J				Arp, G; Hofmann, J; Reitner, J			Microbial fabric formation in spring mounds ("Microbialites") of alkaline salt lakes in the Badain Jaran Sand Sea, PR China	PALAIOS												The large sandy desert of Badain Jaran Shame, Inner Mongolia, has several salt lakes Located among megadunes with crests as high as 400 m. Most of the lakes are hypo- to hypersaline and alkaline, with pH values between 8.5 and 10. Because of their reef-lihe aragonitic pinnacles rising from the lake floor, Lake Nuoertu and Lake Huhejaran have been investigated in detail. The porous limestones of the tufa pinnacles ("spring mounds") result from a hydrochemically forced, exopolymer-mediated calcification of cyanobacteria-dominated microbial mats at sublacustrine springs. The development of their enigmatic fabrics is documented for the first time. Sickle-cell-like and bubble-shaped fabrics reflect successive mineralization. during degradation, shrinkage of the organic mucus, and gas formation by bacteria. Fossil analogues are known from the Pleistocene and Miocene (Ries-crater Lake), but older non-marine, Phanerozoic examples are expected. To the extent that these textures are associated exclusively with alkaline environments, they can be wed to test the hypothesis of an alkaline ocean early in Earth history.																			0883-1351	1938-5323				DEC	1998	13	6					581	592		10.2307/3515349	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3515349													WOS:000077240100007

Ian			Chemical composition and source apportionment of size fractionated particulate matter in Cleveland, Ohio, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												The Cleveland airshed comprises a complex mixture of industrial source emissions that contribute to periods of non-attainment for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and are associated with increased adverse health outcomes in the exposed population. Specific PM sources responsible for health effects however are not fully understood. Size-fractionated PM (coarse, fine, and ultrafine) samples were collected using a ChemVol sampler at an urban site (G.T. Craig (GTC)) and rural site (Chippewa Lake (CLM)) from July 2009 to June 2010, and then chemically analyzed. The resulting speciated PM data were apportioned by EPA positive matrix factorization to identify emission sources for each size fraction and location. For comparisons with the ChemVol results, PM samples were also collected with sequential dichotomous and passive samplers, and evaluated for source contributions to each sampling site. The ChemVol results showed that annual average concentrations of PM, elemental carbon, and inorganic elements in the coarse fraction at GTC were 2, 7, and 3 times higher than those at CLM, respectively, while the smaller size fractions at both sites showed similar annual average concentrations. Seasonal variations of secondary aerosols (e.g., high NO3- level in winter and high SO42- level in summer) were observed at both sites. Source apportionment results demonstrated that the PM samples at GTC and CLM were enriched with local industrial sources (e.g., steel plant and coal-fired power plant) but their contributions were influenced by meteorological conditions and the emission source's operation conditions. Taken together the year-long PM collection and data analysis provides valuable insights into the characteristics and sources of PM impacting the Cleveland airshed in both the urban center and the rural upwind background locations. These data will be used to classify the PM samples for toxicology studies to determine which PM sources, species, and size fractions are of greatest health concern. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

NOV (BACILLARIOPHYTA), A NEW DIATOM GENUS FROM DYSTROPHIC AND INTERMITTENTLY WET TERRESTRIAL HABITATS	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												A new freshwater benthic diatom genus, Microfissurata gen. nov., was identified from light and scanning electron micrographs. The most characteristic morphological feature (referred to also by the name of the new genus) is the structure of the striae/alveoli, which are simple, mostly uninterrupted, transapical slits. The combination of characteristics of the new genus is unique. It includes two new species: Microfissurata paludosa Cantonati et Lange-Bert. sp. nov. and M. australis Van de Vijver et Lange-Bert. sp. nov., distributed in Europe and on an austral island, respectively. The new genus occurs in freshwater dystrophic lakes, pools, seepage springs, mires, and in intermittently wet terrestrial habitats. It is not abundant but widespread wherever these habitat types are well developed, in Nordic-alpine and sub-Antarctic areas. Overall, the new genus appears to be mostly epiphytic (bryophilous) and capable of tolerating a wide range of moisture conditions (xerotolerant). The finding of the type species (M. paludosa) in a well-investigated area like central Europe highlights the diatom species richness of dystrophic habitats and their importance for diatom biodiversity conservation.

Weak vortex states, often associated with sudden stratospheric warmings (SSW), have been shown to increase the risk of cold-spells especially over Eurasia, but its role for North American winters is less clear. Using cluster analysis, we show that there are two dominant patterns of increased polar cap heights in the lower stratosphere. Both patterns represent a weak polar vortex but they are associated with different wave mechanisms and different regional tropospheric impacts. The first pattern is zonally symmetric and associated with absorbed upward-propagating wave activity, leading to a negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and cold-air outbreaks over northern Eurasia. This coupling mechanism is well-documented in the literature and is consistent with the downward migration of the northern annular mode (NAM). The second pattern is zonally asymmetric and linked to downward reflected planetary waves over Canada followed by a negative phase of the Western Pacific Oscillation (WPO) and cold-spells in Central Canada and the Great Lakes region. Causal effect network (CEN) analyses confirm the atmospheric pathways associated with this asymmetric pattern. Moreover, our findings suggest the reflective mechanism to be sensitive to the exact region of upward wave-activity fluxes and to be state-dependent on the strength of the vortex. Identifying the causal pathways that operate on weekly to monthly timescales can pave the way for improved sub-seasonal to seasonal forecasting of cold spells in the mid-latitudes.					; Kretschmer, Marlene/Q-1548-2018; Coumou, Dim/ABE-6666-2020	Runge, Jakob/0000-0002-0629-1772; Wendt, Vivien/0000-0003-1806-4507; Coumou, Dim/0000-0003-2155-8495; Kretschmer, Marlene/0000-0002-2756-9526; 													2397-3722						2018	1								44	10.1038/s41612-018-0054-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41612-018-0054-4													WOS:000468007700044
J	Seppälä, M				Seppälä, M			Surface abrasion of palsas by wind action in Finnish Lapland	GEOMORPHOLOGY					5th International Conference on Geomorphology	AUG, 2001	TOKYO, JAPAN	Int Assoc Geomorphologists, Japanese Geomorphol Union, Chuo Univ				Palsas at Lake Ahkojavri (69degrees35'N, 26degrees11'E), western Utsjoki, Finnish Lapland, display very marked effects of surface erosion. Mainly westerly winds have caused the removal of a layer of peat, in some cases more than 40 cm thick, from the palsa surface. The surface peat of one eroded palsa is radiocarbon dated to 2710 +/- 70 years BP. Many palsas with heights of 1.5-3 m are almost bare of vegetation. Cracks typical of vegetated palsa surfaces are either worn away or filled with wind-drifted peat. Erosion takes place in winter by wind-drifted snow and ice crystals abrading the peat surface. Some recently formed palsas have been found on the same palsa mires. They are located among the eroded mature palsas and range from 60 to 80 cm in height and 20 to 30 m(2) in area. The new palsas also imply strong wind activity in winter. No unusual development in the depth of the active layer on palsas has been noticed. New permafrost is also found in small peat hummocks called pounus. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Sun, FD; Ma, RH; Liu, CX; He, B				Sun, Fangdi; Ma, Ronghua; Liu, Caixia; He, Bin			Comparison of the Hydrological Dynamics of Poyang Lake in the Wet and Dry Seasons	REMOTE SENSING												Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake connecting the Yangtze River in China. It undergoes dramatic dynamics from the wet to the dry seasons. A comparison of the hydrological changes between the wet and dry seasons may be useful for understanding the water flows between Poyang Lake and Yangtze River or the river system in the watershed. Gauged measurements and remote sensing datasets were combined to reveal lake area, level and volume changes during 2000-2020, and water exchanges between Poyang Lake and Yangtze River were presented based on the water balance equation. The results showed that in the wet seasons, the lake was usually around 1301.85-3840.24 km(2), with an average value of 2800.79 km(2). In the dry seasons, the area was around 618.82-2498.70 km(2), with an average value of 1242.03 km(2). The inundations in the wet seasons were approximately quadruple those in the dry seasons. In summer months, the lake surface tended to be flat, while in winter months, it was inclined, with the angles at around 10 ''-16 ''. The mean water levels of the wet and dry seasons were separately 13.51 m and 9.06 m, with respective deviations of around 0-2.38 m and 0.38-2.15 m. Monthly lake volume changes were about 7.5-22.64 km(3) and 1-5.80 km(3) in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. In the wet seasons, the overall contributions of ground runoff, precipitation on the lake surface and lake evaporation were less than the volume flowing into Yangtze River. In the dry seasons, the three contributions decreased by 50%, 50% and 65.75%, respectively. Therefore, lake storages presented a decrease (-7.42 km(3)/yr) in the wet seasons and an increase (9.39 km(3)/yr) in the dry seasons. The monthly exchanges between Poyang Lake and Yangtze River were at around -14.22-32.86 km(3). Water all flowed from the lake to the river in the wet seasons, and the chance of water flowing from Yangtze River in the dry seasons was only 5.26%.					; He, Bin/F-8497-2014; ma, rong/GVU-3096-2022	liu, cai xia/0000-0001-5851-6374; He, Bin/0000-0002-7224-9214; Ma, Ronghua/0000-0002-4485-4636; 														2072-4292				MAR	2021	13	5							985	10.3390/rs13050985	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13050985													WOS:000628503000001

Role of Aquatic Plants in Carbon Dioxide Exchange Between the Littoral Zone of a Eutrophic MidLatitude Lake and the Atmosphere	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Inland water is a crucial component of the land-atmosphere carbon exchange. The role of aquatic plants in carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange has been understudied, and few studies have considered their influence on diel variation. This study analyzed 2 years of eddy covariance CO2 flux data obtained in the littoral zone of a eutrophic midlatitude lake with differing aquatic plant cover. In the summer of 2022, when floating-leaved plants were abundant, marked CO2 uptake was observed during the day, whereas in the summer of 2020, with minimal floating-leaved plant cover, daytime uptake was less pronounced. When averaged, the maximum CO2 uptake occurred in the afternoon in the summer of 2020, when CO2 exchange at the air-water interface likely dominated the total exchange, and uptake was enhanced due to a high gas transfer velocity and presumably low dissolved CO2 concentrations in the afternoon. By contrast, CO2 uptake reached a maximum around noon in the summer of 2022, in phase with solar radiation. The leaves of plants protruded into the air, and direct uptake, due to the leaf photosynthesis, likely caused the cooccurrence of the peak CO2 uptake and solar radiation. The estimated annual CO2 exchange was 14 +/- 7 gC m-2 in 2020 and -170 +/- 4 gC m-2 in 2022. This study found that the abundance of aquatic plants determined the diel environmental dependence of the summer CO2 exchange in the littoral zone of a midlatitude lake, as well as the magnitude and direction of the annual CO2 exchange.																			2169-8953	2169-8961				SEP 3	2025	130	9							e2025JG009029	10.1029/2025JG009029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2025JG009029													WOS:001562444800001

Random positioning of paralyzed grasshoppers near entrances constituted genus-atypical behavior A single paralyzed prey was placed commonly head inward and ventral side upward in the one-celled nest The wasp's egg was laid transversely across the grasshopper's pro- and mesosternum Some females completed two nests per day under favorable weather conditions Sarcophagid flies of the tribe Miltogrammini (Spluxapata rubriventris, S vigilans, S trilineata, Sphenometopa tergata, Taxigramma heteroneura) were major enemies of this wasp.																			1092-6194						2008	15						33	66		10.1656/1092-6194(2008)15[33:INBOTP]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/1092-6194(2008)15[33:INBOTP]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000207523800002

Exceptional mixing events in meromictic Lake Lugano (Switzerland/Italy), studied using environmental tracers	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The deep northern basin of Lake Lugano was permanently stratified over the last 4 decades because of mineralization in response to strong eutrophication. However, two consecutive cold and windy winters (2004-2005 and 2005-2006) destabilized the water column and led to two exceptionally strong mixing events. The conductivity, temperature, and depth time-series data from 1995 to 2006 allowed the reconstruction of the evolution of the water body that made deep convective mixing possible. Over the years 1995-2006, the stability of the water column decreased continuously in winter, reaching a neutral stability at the end of the study period. The Schmidt stability values observed in the winters of 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 were virtually zero. Analyses of helium isotopes, tritium, sulfur hexafluoride, and chlorofluorocarbons in water samples collected immediately after the two mixing events revealed large changes in the tracer concentration profiles and permitted comparisons of the apparent water ages in Lake Lugano with previous measurements. Tracer concentration profiles became more homogeneous and approached atmospheric equilibrium concentrations in the time series. The tracer data, along with changes observed in the physical parameters of the water column, demonstrate the considerable deep-water renewal and gas exchange with the atmosphere that has taken place.

J	Cremona, F; Laas, A; Noges, P; Noges, T				Cremona, Fabien; Laas, Alo; Noges, Peeter; Noges, Tiina			High-frequency data within a modeling framework: On the benefit of assessing uncertainties of lake metabolism	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												We used a Bayesian metabolic model for assessing the gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER) and their uncertainties in lake Vortsjarv, a large eutrophic lake in Estonia (North-eastern Europe). Diel cycle modeling was based on high-frequency (10-min) measurements of irradiance, water temperature and dissolved oxygen during most of the growing season (from May to August 2011). Posterior distribution of production and respiration was successfully simulated with the model and displayed with highly credible intervals (2.5 and 97.5 percentiles). Considering the mean GPP and ER values, the lake was autotrophic from May to June, at equilibrium in July, and heterotrophic in August. However, adding the uncertainty to metabolism estimates revealed that an ambiguous metabolic state (no clear monthly predominance of auto- or hetero-trophy) represented between 12 and 32% of the period. It is thus incautious to conclude about lake metabolic state in these conditions. A comparison with the existing classical model based on dissolved oxygen measurements showed that metabolic dynamics differed between the two approaches. Though the classical model recorded highest ecosystem productivity in midsummer, the Bayesian model predicted that productivity peaked earlier in the season and gradually declined as the irradiance dropped and the water temperature rose. Coupling between GPP and ER during the whole study period was very variable, resulting that, depending on the month, 50-100% of primary production was consumed in the lake. This coupling variability was caused by extensive diel fluctuation of irradiance-dependent production compared to relatively stable water temperature and respiration. The background respiration was high in spring and declined progressively in summer, reflecting lower inputs of allochthonous organic matter to the lake. With a wider use of high-frequency techniques for measuring lake ecological parameters, this kind of performant models that are able to assess lake productivity within small time steps and take into account the uncertainty, will be increasingly needed in the future.

We exposed lesser scaup to background (0.8 mu g/g), moderate (8.1 mu g/g) and high (20.7 mu g/g) levels of dietary Se in captivity and measured survival rates and indices of health in relation to hepatic Se concentrations. There was 100% survival in scaup exposed to Se for 10-weeks (average staging duration at Great Lakes), but ducks in the high treatment group had less lipids. There was 93% survival after 23-weeks (average wintering duration at Great Lakes), but no differences among treatment groups in body composition. There were no effects of Se on oxidative stress and cell-mediated immunity; rather we recorded immuno-stimulatory effects on antibody production. Results from our captive study suggest Se alone did not cause the continental decline in scaup populations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Cherts are common in this formation and contain abundant fossilized microorganisms. These microfossils occur as individual spheres and clots in chert layers (laterally continuous and commonly parallel to the laminae of the host rocks) and nodules (chert grains formed by shrinkage and desiccation of chert layers). Carbonaceous cell walls have been well preserved in chert layers. Based on petrological and geochemical analyses of chert and their host rocks, the mechanisms of cyanobacterial cell silicification and their significance for hydrocarbon exploration have been discussed. A high concentration of dissolved inorganic silica in brine and high pH values are the premise for microorganism blooms and chert deposition. Hot springs may be an important silica source for chert deposition. Hot springs also create extreme conditions for algal blooms in brine with high temperatures, high salinities and toxic and anoxic conditions. Spheroidal cyanobacterial cells were rapidly silicified, and cell structures, e.g., cell walls and inner division patterns (reproduction of cells), were well preserved. Chert with fossilized spheroidal microorganisms can be considered hydrocarbon source rocks.

This hydrodynamic model takes into account the diurnal variability of the heat fluxes on the lake surface and the effects of wind and the Earth's rotation. The results of numerical modeling show that the variability of the total heat flux over 24 h plays a significant role in the variation of the thermal bar movement rate that contributes to the rapid mixing of impurities entering with river water.

The study was conducted in two parts: (1) calculation of the residence time (t(r)) of illite adsorbent, and (2) evaluation of the adsorption time (t(a)) of illite adsorbent. t(r) was calculated based on physical properties (e.g., density, diameter, shape, and roughness) of the illite adsorbent at designated depth of surface water. Subsequently, t(Q) was measured for 4 illite adsorbents (Korea01-Illite, Korea02-Illite, USA-Illite, and China-Illite) at 100 and 100,000 Ig/L Cs, via kinetic adsorption experiment. Upon spraying of illite adsorbents with 50-150 um diameter to locations where lake depth was between 6.5 m and 25.5 m, tr ranged from 0.132 to 3.300 h tQ of 4 illite adsorbents was shorter than 0.6 and 2.5 h, for respective tests using 100 and 100,000 Ig/L Cs. Based on the two characteristic times (t(r) and t(a)), the optimal particle diameter for the 4 illite adsorbents were evaluated at available lake depths in Lake Paldang. The study revealed that the USA-Illite is the efficient adsorbent at 100 itg/L Cs; in contrast, China-Illite could serve as the effective adsorbent at 100,000 Ig/L Cs. Also, it was suggested that adsorbent efficiency had seasonal variations; tr was 2 h longer in winter than summer. In general, the study suggests that in the event of Cs-137 contamination at Lake Paldang, Korea01-Illite is likely the best adsorbent to remove Cs-137 due to its removal efficiency and accessibility from the illite deposit in Korea.																			0301-4797	1095-8630				SEP 1	2020	269								110739	10.1016/j.icarus.2020.110739	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2020.110739								32560984					WOS:000541757200026
J	ROULET, NT; ADAMS, WP				ROULET, NT; ADAMS, WP			SPECTRAL DISTRIBUTION OF LIGHT UNDER A SUB-ARCTIC WINTER LAKE COVER	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This study examines the spectral distribution of light penetrating the snow and ice cover of a lake in subarctic Labrador [Canada]. Using a large sample under a range of cover conditions, the role of distinct layers, (snow, white or snow ice, black or clear ice) commonly found in subartic and temperate lake winter covers, was investigated. Measurement and analysis were restricted to wavelengths between 450 nm and 720 nm. Snow and white ice light transmittance was greatest at 450 and 470 to 500 nm respectively. Absorption was greatest in the red portion of the measured spectrum; white ice showing greater red absorption than snow. Black ice light transmittance showed only a slight wavelength dependence. The differential spectral absorption of light by snow and white ice layers produced a marked spectral distribution of the light that reaches the lake water surface. The importance of a spectral, rather than polychromatic, approach to the study of light, in winter biological limnology studies, is stressed.

Holocene changes in monsoon precipitation in the Andes of NE Peru based on δ18O speleothem records	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Two well-dated delta O-18-speleothem records from Shatuca cave, situated on the northeastern flank of the Peruvian Andes (1960 m asl) were used to reconstruct high-resolution changes in precipitation during the Holocene in the South American Summer Monsoon region (SASM). The records show that precipitation increased gradually throughout the Holocene in parallel with the austral summer insolation trend modulated by the precession cycle. Additionally the Shatuca speleothem record shows several hydro climatic changes on both longer- and shorter-term time scales, some of which have not been described in previous paleoclimatic reconstructions from the Andean region. Such climate episodes, marked by negative excursions in the Shatuca delta O-18 record were logged at 9.7-9.5, 9.2, 8.4, 8.1, 5.0, 4.1, 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 2.1 and 1.5 ka b2k, and related to abrupt multi-decadal events in the SASM. Some of these events were likely associated with changes in sea surface temperatures (SST) during Bond events in the North Atlantic region. On longer time scales, the low delta O-18 values reported between 5.1-5.0, 3.5-3.0 and 1.5 ka b2k were contemporaneous with periods of increased sediment influx at Lake Pallcacocha in the Andes of Ecuador, suggesting that the late Holocene intensification of the monsoon recorded at Shatuca site may also have affected high altitudes of the equatorial Andes further north. Numerous episodes of low SASM intensity (dry events) were recorded by the Shatuca record during the Holocene, in particular at 10.2, 9.8, 9.3, 6.5, 5.1, 4.9, 2.5 and 23 ka b2k, some of them were synchronous with dry periods in previous Andean records.

Algal blooms, circulators, waterfowl, and eutrophic Greenfield Lake, North Carolina	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Lake rehabilitation measures can sometimes have unintended consequences, including increasing certain eutrophication symptoms. An example involves Greenfield Lake, an urban blackwater impoundment within the City of Wilmington, North Carolina. This popular recreational impoundment has experienced noxious phytoplankton and macrophyte blooms, anoxia and hypoxia, and fish kills for many years. Chlorophyll a and biological oxygen demand are strongly correlated within the lake, indicating that decaying algal blooms are an important source of oxygen demand resulting in low dissolved oxygen. Nutrient addition bioassays demonstrated that the phytoplankton strongly responded to nitrogen (N) inputs. Spatially, ammonium, nitrate, and N/P ratios were higher in the upper lake compared with the lower lake, indicating tributary input of inorganic N, whereas phosphorus (P) was higher in the lower lake. A year-long survey indicated that waterfowl, especially cormorants, contributed somewhat to the lake's total N load but a considerable amount of P, particularly in winter. The lake sediments apparently function as P reservoirs, supplying P to the water column during summer, setting the stage for runoff-induced nitrate pulses and subsequent algal blooms. Lake restoration measures initiated in 2005 included installation of solar-powered circulators, introduction of grass carp, and herbicide treatments. These measures resulted in loss of surface macrophyte and algal mats and reduced dissolved oxygen violations but led to a significant increase in phytoplankton chlorophyll a and a tripling of chlorophyll a standard violations in comparison with pre-restoration years. The increased chlorophyll a violations have led to inclusion of the lake on the North Carolina 303(d) list of impaired waters.

Dian Lake in south-western China was selected to demonstrate the impacts of Indian summer monsoon-induced water and sediment availabilities on land surface changes and human behaviours. A new sediment core from Dian Lake in the vicinity of Hebosuo village was analyzed by grain size composition, geochemical content, and minerals to detect land-lake processes that responded to hydroclimatic variations and human impacts through the Holocene. Our data suggest that Dian Lake levels during the last 9.8 cal. ka BP were controlled by the variations of the Indian summer monsoon moisture supply according to the displacements of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. A low lake level stage of similar to 4 m lower than present was determined between 3.1 and 1.73 cal. ka BP, allowing the residents of the Dian culture to occupy the low terrains for settlement and farmland cultivation. With lake level rise at around 1.73 cal. ka BP (220 CE) the high input of clay-fine silt-sized sediments rich in rubidium and barium indicates intensified soil erosion in the Dian Lake basin. Former paddy farmlands and mountain slopes were drained by artificial and natural channels towards the lake in response to strengthened rainfalls covering low terrains by coarse and red alluvial sediments that fostered the residents to abandon the lowlands in the southern basin until 1368 CE. However, the surface erosion process during this period promoted the elevation of the south-eastern delta so that it could be re-occupied since Ming Dynasty. The Indian summer monsoon influence comparable to the modern pattern was responsible for lake level rise to the present level since then but also triggered high seasonality in flood and drought events to foster manual regulation of flood discharge during the last centuries.

Small numbers of Canada geese were found in many locations but only .apprx. 12 sites were used by 1000+ birds. Peak populations in southern Manitoba varied from about 15,000-30,000 Canada geese. The Interlake region between Lake Manitoba and Winnipeg contained the most geese and was the site of an estimated 45% of the kill by hunters. Giant Canada geese (B. c. maxima) predominated in the harvest in most of the Interlake, in southeast and west-central Manitoba. B. c. interior and a similar goose were the major forms killed in the southern Interlake near where the redeveloped Oak Hammock Marsh now attracts autumn peak populations of up to 120,000 migrant Canada geese. Small Canada geese (B. c. hutchinsii and similar forms) predominated in the kill on the Red River, at Delta and in southwest Manitoba.																			0008-3550						1981	95	3					276	280																WOS:A1981MJ42800009

Hydrogeology of the deepest underwater cave in the world: Hranice Abyss, Czechia	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Little is known about water mixing in deep underwater cave shafts of hypogene karst. The Hranice Abyss (HA) in Czechia is currently the deepest underwater cave in the world. It shares a thermal and CO2-rich water source with an adjacent spa. Based on chemical and isotope composition, water in the HA is a mixture of shallow and thermal groundwaters. The shallow local groundwater is distinctly different from the adjacent Becva River water in its elemental chemistry and sulfate delta S-34 values. The thermal water is mixed with 5-10% of modern water, based on tritium content and chlorofluorocarbons. Vertical profiling and deep sampling in the HA showed distinct changes with depth in temperature and TDS. Density-driven flow controls the mixing. In winter, the shallow water of the open HA lake is efficiently cooled; the denser surface water sinks to greater depths, which mixes the water column in the HA. During the summer the shallow water stagnates at the depth of 0-15 m. Periods of stagnation and of accelerated water flow and mixing in the HA perfectly fit with the periodic occurrence of CO2 evasion in the lake and the overall characteristics of the microbial communities, which showed the absence of any functional stratification. Ferric oxyhydroxide precipitation is the major cause for turbidity in the HA. Elevation-specific hydraulic responses of the HA groundwater, caused by the adjacent river's level pulses, enabled a determination of the points along the river course at which the river is connected to groundwater by karst conduits.

Our study of the ice and snow cover of Gossenkollesee (Tyrolean Alps) during 2 complete winter periods, with special emphasis on the relationship between slush layers and the water column, confirms the hypothesis that the drastic changes in the physical and chemical structure of the cover determine biomass and composition of microbial assemblages. The temporal pattern previously described in the Pyrenees applies to the Alps, and we could distinguish 3 periods of winter cover: formation, growth and ablation. During the formation period (November to December), the ice sheet forms and slush layers start to develop. In the growth period (January to May), slush layer assemblages are mainly influenced by organisms deriving from lake plankton, predominantly flagellated chrysophytes, which peaked at different times and depths. During the ablation period (May to June/July), however, the cover assemblages are shaped by organisms and processes in the catchment. Microbial communities are characterized by the appearance of new species, such as Gymnodinium sp., red volvocales and large ciliates. The mutual influence between lake water and winter cover assemblages affects only the upper 1 to 2 m of the water column, while changes in the microbial composition of deeper water layers are slow and poorly related to slush layer assemblages. The appearance of '2 systems in 1 lake' is restricted to ca. 6 mo yr(-1) and the reciprocal influence seems to be even more limited by space and time. During the ablation phase, i.e. when the influence of the catchment is much stronger than that of lake plankton, the slush microbial communities in the Alps and the Pyrenees are more similar to each other than during the growth phase of the cover. Over the whole winter period, the ice and snow cover appeared to be more dynamic, vertically variable and sporadically richer in biomass than the water column.

Biogeochemical redox cycling of arsenic in mine-impacted lake sediments and co-existing pore waters near Giant Mine, Yellowknife Bay, Canada	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Lacustrine sediments, submerged tailings, and their pore waters have been collected at several sites in Yellowknife Bay, Great Slave Lake, Canada, in order to investigate the biogeochemical controls on the remobilization of As from mining-impacted materials under different depositional conditions. Radiometric dating confirms that a mid-core enrichment of Pb, Zn, Cu and Sb corresponds to the opening of a large Au mine 60 a ago. This was evident even in a relatively remote site. Arsenic was enriched at mid-core, coincident with mining activity, but clearly exhibited post-depositional mobility, migrating upwards towards the sediment water interface (SWI) as well as down-core. Deep-water (15 m) Yellowknife Bay sediments that contain buried mine waste are suboxic, relatively organic-rich and abundant in microbes with As in pore waters and sediments reaching 585 mu g/L and 1310 mg/kg, respectively. Late summer pore waters show equal proportions of As(III) and As(V) (16-415 mu g/L) whereas late winter pore waters are dominated by As(III) (284-947 mu g/L). This can be explained by As(III) desorption mechanisms associated with the conversion of FeS to FeS2 and the reduction of As(V) to As(III) through the oxidation of dissolved sulfide, both microbially-mediated processes. Processes affecting As cycling involve the attenuating efficiency of the oxic zone at the SWI, sediment redox heterogeneity and the reductive dissolution of Fe(hydr)oxides by labile organic matter, temporarily and spatially variable.

J	MORIN, JO; KIMBALL, KD				MORIN, JO; KIMBALL, KD			RELATIONSHIP OF MACROPHYTE-MEDIATED CHANGES IN THE WATER COLUMN TO PERIPHYTON COMPOSITION AND ABUNDANCE	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Dense growth of Myriophyllum heterophyllum influenced temperature, dissolved O2, pH and light levels in the littoral waters of Lake Winnipesaukee, a soft-water, New England [USA] lake. Periphyton species composition and abundance (algal units cm-1 stem) were related to the macrophyte-mediated changes in the physicochemical environment. During early summer, M. heterophyllum occupied only the lower part of the water column. Limnetic and littoral waters exchanged readily and were chemically similar. Early summer periphyton species composition was dominated by diatoms from the phytoplankton, entangled in the finely dissected leaves of M. heterophyllum. By mid-summer, M. heterophyllum occupied the entire water column of the littoral zone. The metabolic and photosynthetic activity and dense foliage of M. heterophyllum created marked vertical gradients in physicochemical conditions. Mid-day temperature, dissolved O2, pH and light levels were maximal in the surface waters of the M. heterophyllum mat during the summer. Concurrently, periphyton species composition shifted to blue-green and then to a filamentous green alga on the apex and mid-stem. On the lower stem, diatoms consistently dominated the periphyton. Periphyton abundance on the apex was inversely related to apical elongation. Temporal fluctuations of periphyton abundance on the lower and mid-stem were small throughout the study. Periphyton abundance was lowest on the lower stem, where the deteriorating leaves provided less surface area for colonization.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1983	13	5					403	414		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1983.tb00001.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1983.tb00001.x													WOS:A1983RL26500001

Geochemistry of Holocene sediments from Chilika Lagoon, India: inferences on the sources of organic matter and variability of the Indian summer monsoon	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												We present bulk organic carbon isotopic composition (delta 13C), total organic carbon (TOC) content, and total organic carbon to total nitrogen (C/N) ratio along with major and trace element geochemistry of an AMS radiocarbon-dated Holocene sediment core collected from Chilika Lagoon, India. The data are used to understand changes in the organic matter (OM) sources and the strength of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM). Our results indicate that during early to middle Holocene (10.4-4.9 ka), terrestrial (23-65%) and macrophyte (24-32%) sources were significant contributors to the sediment OM; marine component contributed <= 23%. An abrupt shift in the OM sources was observed at -4.0 ka, marked by a significant decrease in OM contributions from the terrestrial (5%) and macrophyte (14%) end-members, and an increase in the marine end-member source (70%) into the lagoon. The period from -4.0 to 2.1 ka recorded the lowest and highest contribution from the terrestrial (5-11%) and marine (50-70%) sources, respectively. This was followed by a gradual increase in the terrestrial and decrease in the marine contribution to 21% and 25% till the present, respectively. During this period, phytoplankton became the major source (31-40%) of OM to the lagoon. This period also experienced increasing anthropogenic activities in the catchment. In this study, proxy records show a strong ISM during early Holocene (10.4-9.0 ka), which was followed by a gradual weakening until 4.9 ka. At -4.0 ka, an abrupt and pronounced weakening of ISM occurred that was followed by an amelioration of ISM precipitation towards 1.1 ka. Later, the ISM gradually weakened to the present-day condition. Overall, Chilika Lagoon core records exhibit that changes in the Northern Hemisphere summer insolation regulate the long-term trend of ISM during the Holocene.

J	Magnuszewski, A				Magnuszewski, Artur			APPLICATION OF SATELLITE SENTINEL-1 RADAR IMAGES FOR DESCRIPTION OF ICE PHENOMENA ON DEBE RESERVOIR	ACTA SCIENTIARUM POLONORUM-FORMATIO CIRCUMIECTUS												Winter conditions of low air temperature cause development of ice phenomena at rivers and reservoirs, creating often problems in their exploitation. There is a need to continuously monitor the spatial extension of ice phenomena and their different forms. Local water authority (RZGW Warszawa) prepares for rivers under their administration a daily reports on ice conditions in winter. Ice reports are prepared from visual inspection of the RZGW personnel visiting selected sections of the river course. This is specially problematic in holidays and weekends when usually data from observations are missing. In this study it is tested application of microwave remote sensing data from Sentinel-1 platform to observe the development and recession of the ice cover at the Debe reservoir in winter 2017. Satellite Sentinel-1 radar images are distributed by the European Space Agency (ESA) on the open access policy. These are two satellites A and B which every 2 days collect images in SAR active remote sensing technique. Debe reservoir was created in 1963 by closing by the barrage Narew river below its confluence with Bug river. Maximum water head is 7.10 m, and average 6.8 m. Area of the reservoir is 30.3 km(2) average discharge of Bug river at Wyszkow gauge is 162 m(3). s(-1), and Narew river at Zambski Kokielne gauge 139 m(3). s(-1). Retention time of water in the reservoir is 3-4 days. Comparison of the average water temperature at gauge Zambski Kokielne and Wyszkow from the winter half-year of the period 1963-1981 shows the increase of water temperature by 0.5-1 C after the year 1972 when Ostroleka power station was put in to operation.. This difference in the temperature between Narew and Bug rivers is reflected by the ice conditions at the end of winter season. Sentinel-1 SAR instrument emits electromagnetic wavelength of 6 cm (C band), and are use two polarizations VH and VV. Using SNAP program geometric correction and color composite was created for selected images at the beginning and end of ice cover at Debe reservoir on Narew river, covering period January 5-March 6, 2017. It has been found that interpretation of the Sentinel-1 images is most problematic if we want to detect boundary between open calm water and new fast ice. The flow of pancake ice on January 5, 2017 had been recorded and the pattern of ice distribution compared to flow lines calculated by the hydrodynamic CCHE2D model. Result of the hydrodynamic modeling shows circulation pattern in the widest part of the reservoir where are also the most favorable conditions for lake type of ice cover formation.

Understanding the long-term moisture evolution pattern and its forcing mechanisms on the TP during the Holocene may provide insights into the interaction between low-latitude climate systems and midlatitude westerlies. Here, we synthesized 27 paleoclimate proxy records covering the past 9500 years. The results of the rotated empirical orthogonal function analysis of the moisture variation revealed spatial-temporal heterogeneity, which was classified into 5 subregions. Proxy records were then compared with the results from the Kiel Climate Model and other paleorecords. The results showed that moisture evolution on the western-southern-central TP was controlled by the Indian summer monsoon (ISM). On the south-eastern TP, moisture change was affected by the interplay between the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and the westerlies, as well as the ISM. With diverse patterns of circulation system precipitation, moisture changes recorded in the paleorecords showed spatial-temporal discrepancies, especially during the early to middle Holocene. Moreover, given the anti-phase pattern of summer precipitation in the EASM area under El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions and the unstable relationship between the ISM and ENSO, it is reasonable to conclude that relatively strong ENSO variability during the late Holocene has contributed to these discrepancies as Asian summer monsoon precipitation has declined.					zheng, zeyu/A-3867-2013; Zhang, Xiaojian/M-7184-2015														2095-0195	2095-0209				DEC	2023	17	4					981	996		10.1007/s11707-022-1049-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11707-022-1049-3		DEC 2023											WOS:001132079500001

The way light stress controls the recruitment of aquatic plants (phanerogams and charophytes) is a key process controlling plant biodiversity, although still poorly understood. Our aim was to investigate how light stress induced by phytoplankton, that is, independent from the aquatic plants themselves, determines the recruitment and establishment of plant species from the propagule bank. The hypotheses were that an increase in light stress (i) decreases abundance and species richness both of established aquatic plants and of propagules in the bank and (ii) decreases the recruitment success of plants from this bank. 2. These hypotheses were tested in 25 shallow lakes representing a light stress gradient, by sampling propagule banks before the recruitment phase and when the lakes are devoid of actively growing plants (i.e. at the end of winter), established vegetation at the beginning of the summer and phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) during the recruitment and establishment phase. 3. The phytoplankton biomass was negatively correlated with the richness and abundance of established vegetation but was not correlated with the propagule bank (neither species richness nor propagule abundance). The similarity between the propagule bank and established vegetation decreased significantly with increasing phytoplankton biomass. 4. The contrast in species composition between the vegetation and the propagule bank at the highest light stress suggests poor recruitment from the propagule bank but prompts questions about its origin. It could result from dispersal of propagules from neighbouring systems. Propagules could also originate from a persistent propagule bank formerly produced in the lake, suggesting strong year-to-year variation in light stress and, as a consequence, in recruitment and reproductive success of plants.					; bornette, gudrun/J-6404-2017	Arthaud, Florent/0000-0002-9632-264X; Mousset, Mathilde/0000-0002-3839-395X; bornette, gudrun/0000-0002-2242-0060; Wezel, Alexander/0000-0001-5088-5087													0046-5070	1365-2427				APR	2012	57	4					666	675		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2011.02730.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2011.02730.x													WOS:000301227000003

A comparative examination of recent changes in nutrients and lower food web structure in Lake Michigan and Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The lower food webs of Lake Huron and Lake Michigan have experienced similar reductions in the spring phytoplankton bloom and summer populations of Diporeia and cladocerans since the early 2000s. At the same time phosphorus concentrations have decreased and water clarity and silica concentrations have increased. Key periods of change, identified by using a method based on sequential t-tests, were 2003-2005 (Huron) and 20042006 (Michigan). Estimated filtration capacity suggests that dreissenid grazing would have been insufficient to directly impact phytoplankton in the deeper waters of either lake by this time (mid 2000s). Despite some evidence of decreased chlorophyll:TP ratios, consistent with grazing limitation of phytoplankton, the main impact of dreissenids on the offshore waters was probably remote, e.g., through interception of nutrients by nearshore populations. A mass balance model indicates that decreased phosphorus loading could not account for observed in-lake phosphorus declines. However, model-inferred internal phosphorus dynamics were strongly correlated between the lakes, with periods of increased internal loading in the 1990s, and increased phosphorus loss starting in 2000 in Lake Michigan and 2003 in Lake Huron, prior to dreissenid expansion into deep water of both lakes. This suggests a limited role for deep populations of dreissenids in the initial phosphorus declines in the lakes, and also suggests a role for meteorological influence on phosphorus dynamics. The high synchrony in lower trophic level changes between Lake Michigan and lake Huron suggests that both lakes should be considered when investigating underlying causal factors of these changes.

J	Singh, P; Nakamura, K				Singh, Prasamsa; Nakamura, Kenji			Diurnal variation in summer precipitation over the central Tibetan Plateau	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The diurnal cycle of rainfall over the central Tibetan Plateau was investigated by examining data acquired by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Precipitation Radar during the summer monsoon season (June-August) from 1998-2007. High-spatial-resolution data (similar to 5 km X 5 km) were used to identify the role of complex topographic features of the plateau. Diurnal variations in rain rate, frequency of rain, conditional rain rate, and storm-height were analyzed on a monthly basis to determine the characteristics of precipitation. The results are interpreted as precipitation characteristics in a semiarid region with weak prevailing winds. Distinct diurnal variation was seen over hilly regions, valleys, and lakes. Precipitation activity over the hilly region is generally strongest during the late afternoon. But in contrast, valleys and lakes show dominant late-evening peaks, and a secondary morning rainfall peak is distinctly evident over large lakes. However, the time of peak rain rate is delayed with increasing lake size. The shift in rain peak location toward lakes and valleys also appeared clearly.																			2169-897X					OCT 23	2009	114								D20107	10.1029/2009JD011788	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2009JD011788													WOS:000271131700001
J	Hayashi, M; van der Kamp, G; Rudolph, DL				Hayashi, M; van der Kamp, G; Rudolph, DL			Water and solute transfer between a prairie wetland and adjacent uplands, 1. Water balance	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The hydrology and water quality of lakes and wetlands are controlled by the exchange of water and solutes with adjacent uplands. We studied a small catchment in Saskatchewan, Canada, to evaluate the mechanisms of water and solute transfer between the wetland and the surrounding upland. Detailed measurements of hydrologic processes (precipitation, runoff, evapotranspiration, and subsurface flow) and chloride distribution are combined to improve the estimate of the transfer flux. This paper describes hydrologic processes and Part 2 describes the solute transport processes. Large snowmelt runoff occurs in the catchment, which transfers 30-60% of winter precipitation on the upland into the wetland to form a pond in the center. Snowmelt water and summer precipitation infiltrate under the central pond. Infiltration accounts for 75% of water leaving the central pond and evapotranspiration accounts for 25%, Most of the infiltrated water flows laterally in the shallow subsurface to the wet margin of the pond and further to the upland, where it is consumed by evapotranspiration without recharging deep groundwater. The net recharge rate of the aquifer underlying the catchment is only 1-3 mm year(-1). Snowmelt runoff transfers water from the upland to the wetland, and shallow subsurface flow transfers water in the opposite direction. When the two processes are combined, they provide the paths for cyclic transport of solutes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Included were 4 ox-bows, 4 playas and 24 reservoirs. The parts of the lake basins investigated comprised drift lines, flood surcharge zone, summer pool level, recession zone, and continuous water area. A total of 48 plant communities was observed, distr. according to habitat as follows: terrestrial, 13; wetland, 15; and aquatic, 20. Only terrestrial communities were present on drift lines but terrestrial, wetland, and aquatic aggregations were noted in the flood surcharge zone, at summer pool level, and in the recession zone. In the continuous water area, pleustonic, floating leaf, floating mat, and submerged aggregations were encountered. Of the 420 spp. observed, 182 each were terrestrial and wetland plants and only 56 were aquatic spp. The 420 spp. sampled were dispersed throughout 245 genera and 83 families. The relation of rooted plants to wildlife production and methods of controlling lake plants are discussed.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1953	34	3					561	583		10.2307/1929728	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1929728													WOS:A1953UZ51800011

The lake's shrinking over the past decades has attracted considerable attention and several studies have addressed its water balance. Yet, evaporation of shallow groundwater from the dried-up lake bed has not been fully quantified - despite the appreciable size of these areas (approx. 4000 km(2) in summer 2015). Here, we target this water cycle component by combining column experiments with upscaling and regionalisation techniques. In the experiments, we studied evaporation from two undisturbed soil cores from the exposed lake bed in a climate chamber, mimicking diurnal temperature and humidity variations in the three summer months of the study area. Despite the dropping water levels in the columns and the formation of salt crusts, evaporation rates remained remarkably constant (0.12 and 0.20 mm d(-1)). This suggests that the system is not driven by slow vapour diffusion, but controlled by capillary rise in the fine-grained sediments, ensuring steady water supply to the column surface. Thus, evaporation from the dried-up lake bed can be assumed to be largely independent from the unsaturated zone thickness (within the observed water level range) and evaporation rates can be simply upscaled and regionalised by considering the satellite-derived development of dried-up lake bed areas (1998-2020). In this time-period, estimated summer evaporation from the exposed lake bed reached maximum values of 0.04 and 0.07 km3 (summer 2015). While these absolute numbers are significant (comparable to the catchment's annual urban drinking water consumption), they correspond to only 4 and 7 % of the evaporation from the open lake surface (1.06 km(3)).

Snowpack and water temperature are highly correlated in mountain lakes, but we lack a complete understanding of underlying mechanisms. Motivated by predicted declines in snowfall with future temperature increases, we investigated how surface heat fluxes and lake warming responded to variation in snowpack, ice-off, and summer weather patterns in a high elevation lake in the Sierra Nevada, California. Ice-off timing determined the phenology of lake exposure to solar radiation, and was the dominant mechanism linking snowpack to lake temperature. The relative importance of heat loss fluxes (longwave radiation, latent and sensible heat exchange) varied among wet and dry years. Declines in snowpack and ice cover in mountain systems will reduce variability in lake thermal responses and increase the responsiveness of lake warming to atmospheric forcing.					; Sadro, Steven/AGC-7944-2022	Smits, Adrianne/0000-0001-9967-5419; Sadro, Steven/0000-0002-6416-3840; 														2378-2242				JUN	2020	5	3					271	279		10.1002/lol2.10147	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lol2.10147		JAN 2020											WOS:000507511600001

The C20 highly branched isoprenoid biomarker - A new diatom-sourced proxy for summer trophic conditions?	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The exact biological source of the C-20 highly branched isoprenoid (HBI) present in sediments from aquatic systems is unclear. We therefore examined the relationship between the distribution of fossil diatoms and the concentration of the C-20 HBI in a Late Glacial sedimentary record from the Hasseldala Port paleolake in southern Sweden. Using Bayesian multiple linear regression analysis, we show that its concentration is linked primarily to the production of the diatom taxon Gomphonema acuminatum, which accounts for the largest proportion of the temporal variability in the biomarker. By analogy with modern observations, we argue that an increasing amount of Gomphonema acuminatum biomass in our sedimentary record reflects increasing oligotrophy in the paleolake during the summer growing season, especially at times defined by subdued hydrologic flow. Our conclusions are corroborated by the delta C-13 composition of the C-20 HBI biomarker, which points to a negative photosynthetic fractionation between atmospheric CO2 and the pool of dissolved inorganic carbon during diatom bloom, a distinct phenomenon at times of inhibited hydrological flow. Accordingly, we suggest that the C-20 HBI biomarker can be effectively used to reconstruct the trophic state of the paleolake at Hasseldala Port, while its stable isotope composition can provide physicochemical information about the lake conditions during the dry summer season. Moreover, we note that the major hydrological shifts recorded in the Gomphonema acuminatum-C-20 HBI stratigraphy do not coincide with the pollen zone boundaries. We thus infer that aquatic and terrestrial environmental responses to climate change are substantially decoupled through the hydrological system, which highlights the necessity for multi-proxy investigations to decipher past climate events.

Influence of summer flood on the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 in a temperate sedge-grass marsh	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Characteristics Of CO2-C exchange were studied in a temperate herbaceous wetland in 2006 and 2007, years with contrasting hydrological regimes. The wetland Mokre Louky (the "Wet Meadows" near Trebon), Czech Republic (49 degrees 01'30 '' N, 14 degrees 46'20 '' E) is a sedge-grass marsh dominated by Carex acuta L The site is situated in the inundation area of a large human-made lake (Rozmberk fishpond, 5 km(2)). The water table is near the soil surface and is fairly stable throughout the year (+/- 0.1 m), except for flood events, when it can reach up to 2 m above the soil surface. Net ecosystem production (NEP) was calculated from the CO2 fluxes measured by the eddy-covariance technique and was compared with the seasonal course of plant live aboveground biomass. The results show that: (1) the annual net uptake Of CO2-C Was 199 and 220 g C m(-1) yr(-1) in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The daily net CO2-C uptake reached 12-20 g C m(-2) day(-1) in sunny summer days. These values are among the highest values reported for wetlands of the northern hemisphere. (2) Although the observed wetland is adapted to floods, the summer flood substantially reduced its net CO2-C uptake. The daily courses of net CO2-C uptake point to reduced rates Of CO2-C fixation by the vegetation cover. (3) A recovery growth of plant biomass was associated with a second peak of NEP in September 2006.

An increase in mean annual water temperature in the lake by 0.24 degrees C per 10 years also occurred. An increase in air and water temperature in winter months caused a reduction of the period of occurrence of ice cover.

We measured the delta C-13(celluiose) and delta O-18(cellulose) values of bulk cellulose and moss fragments from similar to 11.4ka-long core obtained from a shallow, productive, spring-fed, hardwater lake, Antu Sinijarv, Estonia (593.8 ' N; 2614.5 ' E; 94.6 m a.s.l.; maximum depth 7.3 m), in order to reconstruct regional Holocene climate and lake-basin evolution. Isotopically, the modern waterbody is a well-behaved, open, hydrological system with negligible evaporative effects. Cellulose-isotope records were compared with down-core measurements of loss-on ignition (LOI), carbonate and mineral contents, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), C/N ratio, delta C-13(roc), biomarker indices (P-aig and P-aq), published palaeoecological data and a delta O-18(carbonate) record from the same palaeolake. Green microalgae, freshwater macroalgae (Chara) and aquatic bryophytes were important sources of sedimentary cellulose during different phases in the environmental history of the lake. Although a strong palaeoclimatic imprint can be detected in the delta O-18(carbonate) record from Antu Sinijarv, notably the Preboreal oscillation, the 8.2ka event and an unnamed cold oscillation similar to 3.25ka BP, the isotopic signal of these events may have been amplified by increases in O-18-depleted spring snow melt. In contrast, delta C-13(cellulose) was tightly coupled to the Holocene evolution of terrestrial ecosystems and soils by significant inputs of biogenic carbon from the catchment and sublacustrine springs. During the early Holocene, similar to 11 - 9ka BP, the delta O-18(cellulose) and delta O-18(carbonate) records diverge markedly, which can be attributed to "no-analogue" seasonal, climatic, hydrological and isotopic conditions resulting from orbital forcing and residual ice-sheet impacts.

J	Migal, MG				Migal, Moshe Gophen			The cladoceran trophic status in the nitrogen limited ecosystem of lake Kinneret (Israel)	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												The impact of cladocerans metabolic activities on the carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) dynamics in Lake Kinneret (Israel) is presented. The study, is based on the incorporation of field data and experimental measurements. Grazing, respiration and production rates of Diaphanosoma spp.., Ceriodaphnia spp. and Bosmina spp. were experimentally measured at three temperatures, and the results were extrapolated to the field biomass distibution at these respective temperatures, and the total lake capacity was calculated using the following equation: consumption = respiration + production + excretion. The field capacity of consumption, respiration and production were found to be most correlated with biomass density, but the temporal fluctuation of the percent of excretion from consumed energy differed. The increase in P, decline in N and decrease in the TN/TP mass ratio in the epilimnion of Lake Knneret during 1969-2004 created N limitation. An increase in C and decline in TN, with a consequential increase in the C/TN ratio were documented. TP was augmented but the C/TP ratio was only slightly increased. During 1975-2004, P was probably, a minor limitation for cladoceran growth. The positive impact of recycled P by cladocerans under the N limitation in Lake Knneret is discussed. There is a current threat on the water quality, derived from N limitation (mostly in summer-fall) and consequent Cyanophyta blooms. Thus, the role of recycled P by grazers may be significant.																			0254-8704					JUL	2011	32	4					455	462											22315824					WOS:000292069300008

Recently, this lake has been treated by ultrasonic radiation and jet circulation which were integrated with flushing with river water. This treatment was most likely sufficient for the destruction of cyanobacterial gas vacuoles. In order to confirm whether Microcystis viridis was still present, a molecular genetic monitoring technique on the basis of DNA direct extraction from the sediment was applied. Three primer sets were used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based on rRNA intergenic spacer analysis (RISA), the DNA dependent RNA polymerase (rpoC1) and a Microcystis sp.-specific rpoC1 fragment. The results from each primer were demonstrated on the basis of single strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCP). Using the RISA primer showed different results from the rpoC1 and Microcystis sp.-specific rpoC1 fragment; meanwhile, the rpoC1 Microcystis sp.-specific fragment was more specific than the RISA primer. Therefore, the Microcystis sp.-specific rpoC1 fragment was further analysed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The DNA pattern representing M. viridis could not be detected in any of the sediment samples. However, the results were confirmed with another technique, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (T-RFLP). Although T-RFLP patterns of 16S rDNA in sediment at 91 bp and 477 bp lengths were matched with the T-RFLP of M. viridis (HhaI and MspI endonuclease digestion, respectively), the T-RFLP pattern of 75 bp length was not matched with M. viridis (both of HhaI and MspI endonuclease digestion) which were the major T-RFLP pattern of M. viridis. Therefore, the results most likely indicated that M. viridis seems to have disappeared because of the addition of the ultrasonic radiation and jet circulation to the flushing treatment.																			0959-3993	1573-0972				DEC	2005	21	8-9					1559	1568		10.1007/s11274-005-7893-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-005-7893-y													WOS:000234411400036

Site use, diet and foraging behaviours in two similarly sized geese wintering in China	ARDEA												Competition may occur when two species with similar feeding ecologies exploit the same limited resources in time and space. In recent years, the Eastern Tundra Bean Goose Anser fabalis serrirostris and Greater White-fronted Goose Anser albifrons frontalis have increased in wintering numbers at Shengjin Lake, China. To examine the potential for coexistence and possible avoidance strategies, we studied (1) their habitat use, (2) foraging behaviours and (3) diets of birds foraging in mixed-and single-species flocks. Both species extensively exploited sedge meadows, where they showed considerable overlap in spatial distribution and diet. The percentage feeding time and diet of both species were unaffected by the presence of the other. Greater White-fronted Geese appeared diurnal sedge meadow specialists, almost never feeding in other habitats. Eastern Tundra Bean Geese were less selective, exploiting other habitats, which they increasingly exploited at night in mid-winter. The use of alternative habitats and night feeding may have avoided interspecific competition. While the specialised feeding ecology of Greater White-fronted Geese may make them particularly vulnerable to loss of sedge meadow habitat, Eastern Tundra Bean Geese may be able to adjust because of their use of alternative habitats and a less restricted diet.

Electrolytic cells with spiral electrodes and the big multiwire proportional chamber were used for low tritium concentration measurements on expeditions. With the new design of the cell the enrichment factor of 64.0 +/- A 1.5 % was obtained during the electrolytic process. Correlation of tritium concentration is observed in mud volcanoes and spring water with regional seismicity. The long-term tritium data are shown in natural waters in South Russia.

The area was usedby al least 25 000 birds; 5 species were the dominant: 3 anatids (Anas clypeata, A. platyrhynchos diazi y Oxyura jamaicensis), 1 shorebird (Limnodromus scolopaceus) and 1 coot (Fulica americana). The abundance of A. plazyrhynchos diazi, a threatened endemic subspecies, was remarkable because the 2 200 individuals observed represent 4% of its population.The best represented species showed a differential spatial use, with 3 patterns: I) species with homogeneous use (A. clypeata y E americana), 2) with affinity to a single portion of the wetland (A. p. diazi y O. jamaicensis), and 3) with affinity for both portions of the wetland (L. scolopaceus). The Cienega de Tlahuac is an important wetland for birds in the region; during the winter 6 species protected by the Mexican Government occur there; however, there are human factors that threaten its integrity, so that protective and conservation actions are necessary.																			1870-3453	2007-8706				MAR	2013	84	1					327	337		10.7550/rmb.28632	http://dx.doi.org/10.7550/rmb.28632													WOS:000318380500022

Whilst essential to observe long-term change, satellite images do not provide information on the thermal environment at depth, thus limiting our understanding of lake thermal responses to a warming world. Long-term in situ observational data can fill some of the information gap, with depth-resolved field measurements providing a detailed view of thermal change throughout the water column. However, many previous studies that have investigated multi-decadal changes in lake temperature, both at the surface and at depth, have typically focused on north temperate lakes. Relatively few studies have investigated temperature variations in lakes situated north of the Arctic Circle, which is one of the most rapidly warming regions on Earth. Here, using a 60-year (1961-2020) observational data set of summer water temperature (July-September) from Lake Inari (Finland), we investigate changes in the thermal environment of this pristine lake. Our analysis suggests a statistically significant summer warming trend at the lake surface (+0.25 degrees C decade(-1), p-value <0.1), whilst deepwater temperatures remain largely unchanged. This contrasting thermal response of surface and bottom water temperature to climatic warming has likewise resulted in a strengthening of summer stratification in this high latitude lake. Implications of the observed change in both temperature and stratification on the lake ecosystem will likely be extensive, including impacts on aquatic organisms which this lake supports. Our work builds on the ever-growing literature regarding lake thermal responses to climate change.																			0043-1397	1944-7973				SEP	2022	58	9							e2021WR031543	10.1029/2021WR031543	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021WR031543													WOS:000860580600001

Pollen reconstruction and vegetation dynamics of the middle Holocene maximum summer monsoon in northern China	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Understanding the evolution of the Holocene East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and vegetation response regimes can help predict the climatic variability and vegetation change of future warming. Here, we reconstructed Holocene vegetation and climate change based on pollen, grain size and percent organic matter from a lake sediment profile in Huitengxile Plateau of central Inner Mongolia, northern China. We found that temperate deciduous forest steppe and temperate mixed forest steppe prevailed under maximum EASM during the middle Holocene (similar to 8.3-5.9 cal. kyr BP), with more open vegetation and a weak EASM prior to and following this period. The vegetation succession is consistent with regional records, suggesting a regional vegetation pattern, i.e., oak forest replacing birch and elm forest during the middle Holocene and pine forest expanding at the expense of birch and oak forest since similar to 6.0 cal. kyr BP. A regional synthesis suggests the maximum EASM began at 8.3-7.8 cal. kyr BP in northern China, indicating a significant delay when compared with published records from southern China. The maximum EASM in northern China ended at 5.9-5.5 cal. kyr BP, being similar or slightly delayed from that in southern China.					李, 艳艳/AAX-2977-2021; Liu, Lina/B-3957-2019; Ma, Yuzhen/AAF-6498-2019														0031-0182	1872-616X				AUG 15	2019	528						204	217		10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.05.023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.05.023													WOS:000472123900015

Here, we investigated life history characteristics potentially explaining the invasion success ofPotamopyrgus antipodarum, a small parthenogenetic and ovoviviparous freshwater snail that was recently added to the top "hundred worst" alien species in Europe. We monitored monthly, over the course of 1 year, shell size, number of brooded embryos, and the presence of castrating parasites at three Northeast German sites: a lake (the Kiessee), a stream (Hohen Sprenz), and a small spring brook (Rugen) (N = 1165). We found that (1) despite sharing the same clonal lineage, drastic differences in space and time for size and fecundity were observed, and these differences were linked to specific environmental variables (water temperature, salinity, and current); (2)P. antipodarumreproduces all year around, except at one of our sites, the spring Rugen, where the reproduction was seasonal; (3) none of our dissected specimens was infected by parasites. Together with ovoviviparity and the ability to reproduce parthenogenetically while being released from parasite pressure, the ability to adapt readily to a wide range of habitat conditions is likely paramount for the invasive success ofP. antipodarum.

In particular, western Lake Erie (WLE) is the site of harmful algal blooms (HABs) which are suspected of being driven by excessive nutrient (phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N)) inputs. During 2022 and 2023, in situ nutrient dilution and addition bioassays were conducted at a WLE bloom-impacted location to investigate whether a nutrient reduction regime would be effective in limiting phytoplankton growth during the June diatom-dominated spring blooms and August cyanobacteria-dominated summer blooms. The primary objectives of this experiment were to (1) Determine if a proposed 40% P-alone reduction would effectively reduce phytoplankton growth and mitigate blooms and (2) assess whether reductions in both P and N are more effective in controlling phytoplankton biomass than exclusive reductions in either N or P. Samples were analyzed for nutrient concentrations and growth rate responses for specific algal groups, utilizing diagnostic (for major algal groups) photopigments. Results indicated that although both 20% and 40% dilutions led to lower phytoplankton biomass and growth rates, 40% reductions were more effective. Our results support the USA-Canada Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement recommendation of a 40% P reduction, but also indicate that a parallel reduction of N input by 40% would be most effective in controlling bloom magnitudes. Overall, our findings underscore the recommendation that a year-round dual N and P 40% reduction is needed for long-term control of eutrophication and algal blooms, including cyanobacteria and diatoms, in Lake Erie.

S	Helvaci, C		Pirajno, F; Unlu, T; Donmez, C; Sahin, MB		Helvaci, Cahit			Turkish Borate Deposits: Geological Setting, Genesis and Overview of the Deposits	MINERAL RESOURCES OF TURKEY	Modern Approaches in Solid Earth Sciences											Boron is widely distributed in the earth's crust and the element boron does not exist freely by itself in nature, rather it occurs in combination with oxygen and other elements in salts, commonly known as borates. Boron is a rare element in the Earth's crust, but extraordinary concentrations can be found in places. Four main continental borate provinces are recognized at a global scale. They are located in Anatolia (Turkey), California (USA), Central Andes (South America) and Tibet (Central Asia). The origin of borate deposits is related to Cenozoic volcanism, thermal spring activity, closed basins and arid climate. Borax is the major commercial source of boron, with major supplies coming from Turkey. Colemanite is the main calcium borate and large scale production is restricted to Turkey. Main borax (tincal) deposits are present in Anatolia (Kirka), California (Boron), and two in the Andes (Tincalayu and Loma Blanca). Colemanite deposits with/without probertite and hydroboracite are present in west Anatolia, Death Valley, California, and Sijes (Argentina). Quaternary borates are present in salars (Andes) and playa-lakes and salt pans (USA and Tibet). The Karapinar playa-lake is located in central Turkey. The formation of borate deposits consisting of a sodium- and calcium-borate hydrates group associated with playa-lake sediments and explosive volcanic activity. Some conditions are essential for the formation of economically viable borate deposits, playa-lake volcano-sedimentary sequences: formation of playa-lake environment; concentration of boron in the playa lake, sourced from andesitic to rhyolitic volcanics, direct ash fall into the basin, or hydrothermal solutions along faults; thermal springs near areas of volcanic activity; arid to semi-arid climatic conditions; and lake water with a pH of between 8.5 and 11. A large number of minerals contain boric oxide, but the three that are most important from a worldwide commercial standpoint are borax, ulexite, and colemanite, which are produced in a limited number of countries. Turkey has the largest borax, ulexite and colemanite reserves in the world and all the world's countries are dependent upon the colemanite and ulexite reserves of Turkey. The main borate districts are located in Bigadic, Kestelek, Sultancayir, Emet, Kirka and Gocenoluk areas. Most of the world's commercial borate deposits are mined by open pit methods. Boric acid is one of the final products produced from most of the processes. Further research on the mineralogy and chemistry of borate minerals and associated minerals will the production and utilization of borate end-products. Many modern industries need industrial borate minerals, and many individuals use their products. Therefore, borates and associated products are critical for the sustainable development of the world.																			1876-1682		978-3-030-02950-0; 978-3-030-02948-7				2019	16						535	597		10.1007/978-3-030-02950-0_11	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-02950-0_11	10.1007/978-3-030-02950-0												WOS:000626351700012

Recognizing these signals of impending eruption and their timing is essential for adequate volcanic forecasting. The Popocatepetl eruptions that began on December 21, 1994, were preceded by increases in volcano-tectonic seismic events VTs, increasing temperature and sulfate and chloride concentrations in the crater lake, decreasing pH as well as rising pCO(2) in the spring water. Long period seismic events also increased before many of the eruptions and harmonic tremor episodes as well as negative magnetic anomalies precede dome formation and are linked to magma ascent. The VT cumulative seismic energy rose sharply preceding the main eruptions. Clear precursors were detected before the December-January 2001 eruptions. Two months before the eruption, negative magnetic anomalies correlated with increased seismicity, as well as small changes in the spring water were observed. Additionally, a few days before the eruption, episodes of high amplitude tremor and high SO2 flux were detected and together with the analysis of the RSAM data were the bases for the adequate evaluation and forecasting of the 2000 eruption.					; Martin-Del-Pozzo, Ana Lillian/GRF-1505-2022	Martin-Del-Pozzo, Ana Lillian/0000-0003-4364-3762; 													0016-7169					JAN-MAR	2012	51	1					87	107																WOS:000298741200007

Trace elements (REE plus Y) reveal marine, subaerial, and hydrothermal controls on an early Archean habitat for life: The 3.48 Ga volcanic-caldera system of the dresser formation, Pilbara Craton	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Host to some of Earth's earliest evidence of life, the fossiliferous lowermost chert-barite sequence (DFc1) in the-3.5 Ga Dresser Formation of the Pilbara Craton, Western Australia is interpreted to have deposited within a dynamic volcanic-hydrothermal caldera. To date, three end-member fluid compositions (marine, hydrothermal, and subaerial) have been identified using trace and rare earth elements. However, this data has been limited to a few, single rock units, providing only snapshots at various depositional time intervals, and does not represent a synthesis of habitat evolution over time. Here, we present a systematic trace and rare earth element study of 31 whole-rock samples from 10 lithofacies across the entire stratigraphic sequence. Samples include bedded cherts (silicified chemical and clastic sedimentary rocks), hot spring geyserite and sinter terracettes, jaspilitic chert, and silicified volcaniclastic siltstone. Four lithostratrigraphically-defined assemblages (A1-A4) in DFc1 illustrate a transition from marine (underlying pillowed North Star Basalts, deep marine cherts) to shallow water and subaerial conditions (evaporitic carbonate-chert couplets, hot spring geyserite and sinter terracettes, channelized conglomerates and basaltic-evolved volcaniclastics)(A1-A2), followed by a return to deep marine conditions (jaspilitic chert, volcaniclastic siltstone and sandstone)(A3-A4). Our trace and rare earth element data enhance the four-stage model (reflecting, A1-A4 respectively) as follows: stages 1-2, crustal inflation generated the emplacement of a deep-rooted magmatic chamber, leading to surface uplift and a transition from deep water to hydrothermally-influenced semi-restricted lakes, stromatolites, and subaerial hot springs. Trace and rare earth element patterns of A2 geyserite indicate the circulation of low-temperature near-surface, non-marine geothermal fluids through basaltic to more evolved volcaniclastic rocks. REE + Y patterns of sinter terracettes may indicate the formation of hot spring travertine in DFc1; stages 3-4, hydrothermally-influenced jaspilites and volcaniclastic sediments deposited in marine basins driven by caldera collapse. This stifled stromatolite growth and represents the end of subaerial exposure. This work contributes to ongoing efforts to reconstruct Earth's early life habitats, which inform the search for life on Mars and origin of life studies.					; Brengman, Latisha/J-5823-2019	Djokic, Tara/0000-0002-2063-3695; 													0009-2541	1872-6836				JAN 20	2024	644								121865	10.1016/j.chemgeo.2023.121865	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2023.121865		DEC 2023											WOS:001135538100001

However, the dynamics of these changes remain inadequately understood. In this study, we present a 28.6 thousand-year record of precipitation hydrogen isotopes (SDp) derived from sedimentary leaf wax n-alkanoic acids (C30, SDwax) from Mang Co Lake, a lake in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. Our analysis interprets SDp as a proxy for Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) intensity, revealing its strongest phase during both the early Holocene and 28.6-26.5 calibrated thousand years before present (Cal ka BP), as well as its weakest during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). We find that summer insolation is the primary driver of ISM variability on the orbital scale over the past 28.6 ka. Millennial scale SDp variability reflects interactions between the summer monsoon and the westerly jet (WJ). The SDp record reveals that in the periods of 5-3 Cal ka BP and 1-0 Cal ka BP, a weakened ISM coincided with the WJ's prolonged residence south of the Tibetan Plateau. Abrupt cooling events due to albedo feedback of ice and snow in high latitudes are inferred to have played a critical role in modulating the atmospheric circulation patterns, including the position and intensity of the WJ and ISM. Our findings emphasize the high sensitivity of the southeastern Tibetan Plateau's hydroclimate to global climate changes, necessitating future reconstructions with improved temporal and spatial resolution.

These records show the presence of phases of increased effective moisture, while regional vegetation was dominated by steppe species. The longest lake record comes from La Salineta, one of the saline lakes in the Los Monegros area; the other lake sequence comes from a sinkhole in the Gallego River floodplain. The slope deposit from Valmadrid is the only periglacial deposit found in the central Ebro valley. Our data indicate that, at least for some intervals during full glacial times, when cold steppe vegetation dominated the region, some lakes experienced more positive water balance than today, and run-off was also high. The data are coherent with the hypothesis that, at least for some periods, the ice-age climate of the western Mediterranean was characterized by cold winters, with relatively higher effective moisture (precipitation minus evaporation ratio) and summer droughts. Increased flow from the Pyrenean rivers during the early deglaciation could also have played a significant role in the paleohydrological cycle in the central Ebro valley. However, La Salineta records also show evidence for and periods during glacial times, indicating the complex evolution of hydrology and moisture availability in the central Ebro valley during the LGM.

High orbital-scale resolution records spanning across the Mid-Brunhes event in the arid deserts provide a climate analogue since the formation of deserts. However, there was no definite work in the deserts so far. Here, we present the results of a chronological and paleo-environmental study of a 122.63 m-long core drilled in the largest lake basin in the central Tengger Desert (northern China), located in the northwestern margin of East Asian Summer Monsoon regions. Following comprehensive paleomagnetism analysis, the Matuyama/Brunhes boundary was detected at a core depth of 87.5 m, and the basal age of the core is estimated at-940 ka based on orbital tuning. The lithology, grain size, carbonate and total organic carbon content were analyzed to examine the sedi-mentary facies and reconstruct the paleoenvironmental evolution. Ten relatively humid layers were identified by sedimentary facies, further results confirmed by fine grain size, high carbonate, and total organic carbon content, which generally developed during interglacial and were controlled by the East Asian summer monsoon precipitation during the past 940 ka. Since-500 ka, the interglacial climate regime displayed an intensified aridification manifested as shrinking lakes and persistent mobile dunes in the Tengger Desert. We argue that this aridification was caused by the combination of a massive supply of clastic material for the desert and the occurrence of higher potential evapotranspiration during warmer interglacials after the Mid-Brunhes Event. This research finding provides geological evidence for the aridification of the deserts in the East Asian Summer Monsoon margin under global warming.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Here such relationships are further examined and the possible mechanisms are explored via numerical sensitivity experiments with a regional climate model (RegCM4.5). The positive/negative sensible heat flux (SH) anomalies were added as a forcing to a key region near 50 degrees N of East Asia in RegCM4.5 to simulate the observed ground surface temperature (GST) anomalies. The model results suggest that the nonuniform land surface warming over the Lake Baikal area (50 degrees-60 degrees N, 90 degrees-120 degrees E) can indeed cause the weakening of the extratropical cyclogenesis and affect the decadal weakening of the EASM. Warm (cold) GST forcing over the key GST region can lead to decreasing (increasing) atmospheric baroclinicity and related energy conversion of the EC activity over the key EC region (40 degrees-50 degrees N, 90 degrees-120 degrees E), resulting in an evidently weakening (enhancing) of the ECs over East Asia. Meanwhile, precipitation shows a dipole pattern with significantly suppressed (enhanced) precipitation in northern and northeastern China, and slightly enhanced (suppressed) rainfall south of 40 degrees N of East Asia, mainly over the East China Sea. Lake Baikal and its adjacent areas are occupied by a strong anticyclonic (cyclonic) circulation while the southeast coastal areas of China have a relatively weak cyclonic (anticyclonic) circulation accompanied with an anomalous northeasterly (southwesterly) wind to the southeast of the anticyclonic circulation, which is opposite to (coincident with) the atmospheric circulation anomalies that are associated with the second mode of the EASM.

Origins of hatchery-reared lake trout Salvelinus namaycush to Lake Michigan's sport fishery reflect trends in regional relative survival	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Fisheries management depends on understanding fish movements, especially in large systems. In Lake Michigan, lake trout are stocked for rehabilitation and to support a diverse, multi-million dollar sport fishery. We described the contributions of lake trout stocked at offshore and onshore locations to Lake Michigan's sport fishery at multiple spatial scales. We also assessed lake trout relative survival and age-related seasonal movements. Offshore reefs, which historically were important sources of lake trout recruitment and are currently fishery refuges, served as source-populations for nearshore fisheries, as offshore-stocked lake trout comprised 58% of recoveries lakewide and were predominant in fisheries from 9 of 13 management units. By contrast, lake trout stocked onshore primarily had local importance, consistent with the management aim to directly benefit nearshore fisheries. Lake trout relative survival significantly differed among stocking regions but not between the two genetic strains compared. Lake trout stocked at two of the three offshore regions, Julian's Reef and Southern Refuge, had higher relative survival (0.022-0.038 fish/sampling day/100,000 fish stocked) compared to the three onshore stocking regions (0.001-0.013) and the offshore Northern Refuge (0.011), which helps explain the predominance of offshore-stocked fish in fisheries at most locations. In addition, offshore-stocked fish were most available to sport fisheries in multiple regions during summer, while mature fish generally returned to their stocking region in fall, presumably to spawn. This study demonstrated that stocking at offshore locations in Lake Michigan supported both lake trout rehabilitation efforts and sport fisheries, and illustrates how spatial ecology can help inform fisheries management.

J.; Williamson, David			Climatic patterns in equatorial and southern Africa from 30,000 to 10,000 years ago reconstructed from terrestrial and near-shore proxy data	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												As part of a wider study of last glacial and deglacial climates in the Southern Hemisphere continents, we here review terrestrial and near-shore marine records from equatorial and southern Africa between 30,000 and 10,000 years ago (30-10 ka). This time interval covers the lead-up to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM: 21 +/- 2 ka), the LGM proper, and the ensuing deglacial. Records selected for review needed to meet three requirements: continuity or near continuity over the period; a well-established chronology; and at least one but preferably several unambiguous proxy(ies). We aim to show how regional climates of the sub-continent have responded to orbital forcing as opposed to other global glacial-interglacial boundary conditions, and how they are related to high latitude climates, sea and land surface conditions, positions of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and of the westerly belt. Evidence of past climates derived from many independent proxies is given from west to southwest Africa (moisture from the Atlantic Ocean), then from equatorial East Africa to the southern subtropical summer rainfall domain (moisture mainly from the Indian Ocean). The LGM was cooler than today, and generally drier in the tropics. North of 8-9 degrees S, glacial to Holocene increase in monsoonal precipitation, primarily related to orbitally-induced summer insolation in the northern hemisphere, occurred by steps of increasing amplitude (similar to 17-16, 14.5, 11.5 ka). Major wet-dry spells coincide with abrupt warm-cold events in high northern latitudes and related ITCZ migrations. In the southern tropics, the main post-glacial increase in tropical rainfall generally appears more gradual and in phase with Antarctic warming. Data suggest a restricted northward migration of the ITCZ and concentration of tropical rainfall well south of the Equator during the LGM and the Younger Dryas. Drier glacial conditions prevailed in southeastern Africa, while parts of southwestern Africa point to enhanced humidity during the LGM, suggesting that the winter westerly belt was either stronger than today or displaced further north possibly as a result of more extensive Antarctic sea-ice. Inferred African climatic fluctuations show the competing influences of tropical and high latitude climates of both hemispheres, and suggest changes in both meridional and zonal circulation modes. This review also reveals major geographical and methodological gaps, and a number of unresolved issues providing pointers for future research. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Addressing agricultural phosphorus loss in artificially drained landscapes with 4R nutrient management practices	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Agricultural phosphorus (P) loss has been linked to the eutrophication of surface water bodies throughout the world. As a result, minimizing offsite P transport has become a priority in many rural watersheds. In the US Midwest and other subsurface tile-drained regions, there is a critical need to identify nutrient management practices that decrease P loss in both surface and subsurface discharge. An edge-of-field (EOF) network monitoring 38 agricultural fields was established in northwest Ohio, United States, to quantify the impacts of prevailing and novel crop production and conservation management practices on surface and subsurface P concentrations and loads. In this study, we evaluate nutrient management practices across these fields with varying characteristics in order to identify a suite of management practices within the 4R nutrient management framework (right source, right rate, right time, and right place) that reduce agricultural P loss in artificially drained landscapes. EOF monitoring data indicate that applying organic fertilizers at P-based rates, soil testing and following recommended application rates, avoiding fertilizer application during wet periods of the year (e.g., winter and early spring) and prior to large precipitation events, and placing fertilizer below the surface are all practices that result in decreased P loss. Findings also highlight the importance of field hydrology on surface and subsurface P transport and suggest that water management practices may also be effective at decreasing P loss. While the effectiveness of the nutrient management practices evaluated in this study will likely vary across fields with different characteristics, implementation of these practices should be considered a directionally correct (i.e., will reduce nutrient loss) approach for addressing excess P loss from artificially drained landscapes.					; Pease, Lindsay/AAS-5464-2020	Williams, Mark/0000-0002-8081-8018; Pease, Lindsay/0000-0002-1276-8493; 													0022-4561	1941-3300				JAN-FEB	2018	73	1					35	47		10.2489/jswc.73.1.35	http://dx.doi.org/10.2489/jswc.73.1.35													WOS:000419360900007

Density-Dependence and Environmental Conditions Regulate Recruitment and First-Year Growth of Common Carp in Shallow Lakes	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Recruitment dynamics of fishes can determine their abundance and subsequent effects of adult populations on ecosystem properties. Common Carp Cyprinus carpio is a widespread invasive species that can exert negative density-dependent effects on aquatic food webs. However, little is known concerning processes that regulate their recruitment. We used summer-through-fall electrofishing catch rates of age-0 Common Carp to investigate the importance of biotic (stock size, prey availability, egg and juvenile predation, intraspecific competition) and abiotic (water level fluctuation, temperature, wind events) factors on recruitment and growth in 13 lakes across eastern South Dakota from 2008 to 2010. Mean relative abundance of age-0 Common Carp was highly variable spatially and temporally, ranging from 0 to 152.2 fish per hour of electrofishing. Ricker stockrecruitment models indicated that peak production of age-0 Common Carp occurred when adult Common Carp relative abundance was low. Recruitment also increased with springsummer temperatures, decreased with wind events, and was affected by annual water level fluctuations. Age-0 Common Carp growth, estimated by mean size in August, was highly variable (mean TL = 42165mm) and influenced by the abundance of conspecifics and wind events, indicating that density-dependent interactions may have occurred during early life stages. Combined, our results suggest that the early life history of Common Carp is regulated by density-dependent processes and abiotic environmental conditions, which provide new insights into mechanisms regulating recruitment of this widespread invasive species.

J	Bergman, O; Be'eri-Shlevin, Y; Ninio, S				Bergman, Oded; Be'eri-Shlevin, Yaron; Ninio, Shira			Sodium levels and grazing pressure shape natural communities of the intracellular pathogen Legionella	MICROBIOME												Background Legionella are parasites of freshwater protozoa, responsible for Legionellosis. Legionella can be found in a variety of aquatic environments, including rivers, lakes, and springs, as well as in engineered water systems where they can potentially lead to human disease outbarks. Legionella are considered to be predominantly freshwater organisms with a limited ability to proliferate in saline environments. Exposure of Legionella to high sodium concentrations inhibits growth and virulence of laboratory strains, particularly under elevated temperatures. Nonetheless, Legionella have been identified in some saline environments where they likely interact with various protozoan hosts. In this work, we examine how these selection pressures, sodium and grazing, help shape Legionella ecology within natural environments. Utilizing Legionella-specific primers targeting a variable region of the Legionella 16S rRNA gene, we characterized Legionella abundance, diversity, and community composition in natural spring clusters of varying sodium concentrations, focusing on high sodium concentrations and elevated temperatures. Results We observed the highest abundance of Legionella in spring clusters of high salinity, particularly in combination with elevated temperatures. Legionella abundance was strongly related to sodium concentrations. The Legionella community structure in saline environments was characterized by relatively low diversity, compared to spring clusters of lower salinity. The community composition in high salinity was characterized by few dominant Legionella genotypes, not related to previously described species. Protozoan microbial community structure and composition patterns resembled those of Legionella, suggesting a common response to similar selection pressures. We examined Legionella co-occurrence with potential protozoan hosts and found associations with Ciliophora and Amoebozoa representatives. Conclusions Our results indicate that selection forces in saline environments favor a small yet dominant group of Legionella species that are not closely related to known species. These novel environmental genotypes interact with various protozoan hosts, under environmental conditions of high salinity. Our findings suggest that alternative survival mechanisms are utilized by these species, representing mechanisms distinct from those of well-studied laboratory strains. Our study demonstrate how salinity can shape communities of opportunistic pathogens and their hosts, in natural environments, shedding light on evolutionary forces acting within these complex environments.					; Ninio, Shira/HSD-7221-2023	Ninio, Shira/0000-0002-9433-2182; 													2049-2618					JUL 31	2023	11	1							167	10.1186/s40168-023-01611-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40168-023-01611-0								37518067					WOS:001040279000001

We transferred age-1 hatchery fall Chinook salmon to net-pens in October 2005 and age-0 fall Chinook salmon in May 2006. Indices of smolt development were assessed in the hatchery and after 3 and 14 d in net-pens. Based on gill Na+, K+-ATPase activity and plasma thyroxine (T4) concentration, age-1 Chinook salmon were not developing smolt characteristics in the hatchery during October. Fish transferred to the river or lake had increased plasma cortisol in response to stress and increased T4 accompanying the change in water, but they did not have altered development. Variables in the age-0 Chinook salmon indicated that the fish in the hatchery were smolting. The fish in the river net-pens lost mass and had gill ATPase activity similar to that of the fish in the hatchery, whereas the fish transferred to the lake gained mass and length, had reduced condition factor, and had higher gill ATPase than the fish in the river. These results, along with environmental variables, suggest that the conditions in the lake were more conducive to smoltification than those in the river and thus accelerated the development of Chinook salmon. No Chinook salmon in the hatchery or either net-pen became infected with the myxosporean parasite Ceratomyxa shasta (the presence of which in the river and lake was confirmed) during either trial or when held for 90 d after a 10-d exposure in net-pens (2006 group). We concluded that that there is little evidence of physiological impairment or significant upriver vulnerability to C. shasta among this stock of fall Chinook salmon that would preclude them from being reintroduced into the Upper Klamath River basin.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				DEC	2009	29	6					1743	1756		10.1577/M08-230.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M08-230.1													WOS:000277113800021

Amino acid racemization in lacustrine ostracodes, part II: Paleothermometry in Pleistocene sediments at Summer Lake, Oregon	QUATERNARY GEOCHRONOLOGY												The extent of amino acid racemization in fossil ostracodes of known age has served as a valuable proxy indicator of Pleistocene temperatures in the Great Basin of the western U.S. Here we assess the utility of this technique for estimating paleotemperatures in the Summer Lake basin of south-central Oregon. The enantiomeric composition (D/L values) of aspartic acid and glutamic acid was measured in Candona and Limnocythere ostracode valves collected from 32 sedimentary horizons within a similar to 16-m section of lacustrine sediments associated with pluvial Like Chewaucan and exposed along the Ana River. independent geochronologic control spanning the past 250,000 years is provided by a recently revised age-depth model for the Ana River section. Measured D/L values in the fossil ostracodes generally increase down-section, but the trend is not monotonic and contains stratigraphic reversals. The D/L values from the Ana River section are significantly lower than those measured in ostracodes of comparable age from Lake Bonneville sediments, implying that the Summer Lake basin was colder than the Bonneville basin during the middle and late Quaternary. Although a higher north-south temperature gradient during the Pleistocene is expected considering the proximity of the Ana River site to former ice sheets, published amino acid paleothermometry equations for Candona yield unreasonably cold Pleistocene temperatures at Summer Lake. Measurements of fossil Candona valves from deposits across the western U.S. and northern Sonora reveal abnormally high amino acid concentrations in the subset of Ana River ostracodes analyzed, possibly related to unusual preservation and environmental factors at this site. This suggests that ostracode preservation has an influence on rates of racemization which complicates the application of amino acid paleothermometry at the Ana River site. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This data set will ultimately be used,to interpret and calibrate data acquired from lake sediment cores with the goal of reconstructing past climate. Species assemblages and isotope values can be assigned to three groups: (1) springs, seeps and streams, (2) permanent ponds and lakes, and (3) ephemeral ponds and lakes. Springs, seeps and streams are characterized by Darwinula sp., Heterocypris incongruens, Eucypris fontana, Amphicypris nobilis and Ilyocypris ramirezi. Ostracode and water isotope values range between -13 and -5parts per thousand for oxygen, and between -15 and -3parts per thousand for carbon. They are the most negative of the entire sample set, reflecting ground water input with little or no evaporative enrichment. Limnocythere patagonica, Eucypris labyrinthica, Limnocythere sp. and Eucypris aff. fontana are typical species of permanent ponds and lakes. Isotope values indicate high degree of evaporation of lake waters relative to feeder springs and streams and range between -7 and +5parts per thousand for oxygen, and -5 and +4parts per thousand for carbon. Limnocythere rionegroensis is the dominant species in ephemeral ponds and lakes. These systems display the most enriched isotope values in both ostracodes and host waters, extending from -5 to +7parts per thousand for oxygen, and from -5 to +6parts per thousand for carbon. Living ostracodes show a positive offset from equilibrium values of up to 2 parts per thousand for oxygen. Carbon isotope values are up to 6 parts per thousand more negative than equilibrium values in highly productive pools. Comparison of ostracode and host water isotope signals permits assessment of the life span of the aquatic environments. Valves from dead ostracodes collected from ephemeral ponds and lakes show a wide scatter with each sample providing a snapshot of the seasonal history of the host water. The presence of the stream species L ramirezi and a wide range of ostracode isotope values suggest that ephemeral ponds and lakes are fed by streams during spring run-off and seasonally dry. A temporary character of waters is also indicated by H. incongruens, a drought-resistant species that occupies most springs and seeps. In addition, L. rionegroensis has adjusted its reproduction strategies to its environment. Whereas only females were collected in fresh host waters, males were found in ephemeral ponds and lakes with higher solute content. Sexual reproduction seems to be the more successful reproduction strategy in waters with high and variable salinities and affected by seasonal droughts. The temporary character of the aquatic environments shows that the availability of meteoric water controls the life span of host waters and underlines the sensitivity of the area to changes in precipitation.

Results show that U-238 activity varies between 4.5 and about 309 mBq l(-1) in wells, 0.6 and 8.5 mBq l(-1) in hot springs, 9.7 and 28 mBq l(-1) in rivers, 2.5 and 16 mBq l(-1) in tap waters and between 6 and 24 mBq l(-1) in lakes. The U-234/U-238 activity ratio varies in the range 0.87-3.35 in all analyzed water samples except for hot springs where it reaches values higher than 7. Unlike well water, mineral water samples present low U-238 activities and high U-234/U-238 activity ratios and Ra-226 activities. The highest activity of radium in mineral water is 150 times higher than the highest activity of Ra-226 found in well water, Ra-226/U-238 activity ratios are in the ranges 0.07-1.14 in wells, 0.04-0.38 in rivers. 0.04-2.48 in lakes, and 1.79-2115 in springs. The calculated equivalent doses to all the measured activities are inferior to the maximum contaminant levels recommended by the International Commission of Radioprotection and they do not present any risk for public health in Morocco.

However, if the local water cycling processes and balance remains unclear, it will in turn hinder effective water utilization and management. Surface water leakage concurs with groundwater overexploitation at the largest shallow grassy lake in the North China Plain, i.e., Baiyangdian Lake (BYDL). Simultaneously, evapotranspiration of the lake is another major factor causing water loss due to the widely distributed reeds. Since the establishment of Xiong'an New Area around BYDL in 2017, the lake water has been regularly replenished by artificial water diversion projects in autumn and winter, maintaining the year-round lake water level between 6.5 and 7.5 m. Many prior studies have measured the leakage or evapotranspiration in BYDL, but none of them has measured and compared both the leakage and evapotranspiration simultaneously. This study aims to better understand the contribution of these two aspects to lake water losses. The water level or hydraulic head, temperature of both the lake water and groundwater at different depths, and evapotranspiration rate were observed from August, 2019 to February, 2020, covered by the artificial water diversion. Using heat tracer method and eddy covariance technique, the lake leakage and evapotranspiration rates were evaluated and compared. It is found that during the monitoring period the average leakage rate (5.60 mm days(-1)) is more than twice of that (2.46 mm days(-1)) of the evapotranspiration. Furthermore, the lake water loss volume by leakage notably exceeded the average total lake capacity, which can be mostly attributed to the severe groundwater overexploitation in the underlying plain. These new findings will promote more accurate water diversion amount settings, groundwater recharge and wetland recovery assessments.

Greatest phytoplankton biomass (mostly algae) was attained in April and May under thick ice and snow. The zooplankton was sparse; Cyclops was most abundant in winter, but cladocerans and rotifers had no seasonal maxima. The lake had a total water replacement of 38.7 times/yr. Heavy June runoff flushes out more than 99% of the plankton. On an annual basis, about twice as much plankton biomass is lost through the outlet as comes in through the inlet. Total monthly organic seston sedimentation (fallout) rates for the whole lake ranged from 16.1 kg in Oct. to 730.8 kg in June. Total annual seston production (balance) was 8.0 g organic matter of 4.24 g C/m2.																			0020-9309						1977	62	2					255	278		10.1002/iroh.1977.3510620205	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.1977.3510620205													WOS:A1977DP13300005
J	Schaetzl, RJ				Schaetzl, RJ			A spodosol-entisol transition in northern Michigan	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Soils in northern lower Michigan, all formed in sandy glacial out-wash, were examined to determine the effects of vegetation and fire frequency vs. climate on their development. To accomplish this, soil development was quantified for 13 pedons that span a region known as the Grayling Fingers. Next, a GIS was used to examine spatial interrelationships among the following data sets for the Fingers area: soils, climate, and presettlement vegetation. The 13 sampled pedons span a major pedologic ecotone between an area of strongly expressed spodic morphology (with hardwood forests, low fire frequencies, and deep snowpacks) and one where soils are Psamments. The Psamment area is dominated by jack pine and oak barrens, which frequently burned in presettlement time, and have much less snow cover in winter. The texture and mineralogy of all pedons are generally similar, thereby, ruling out parent material as a controlling factor in their development. The relationships among vegetation patterns and soil development remain unclear in this area. Spatial relationships among snowfall amounts and snowpack thicknesses, however, correlate extremely well to soil development patterns. Thus, I conclude that in this region, patterns of soil development are related primarily to the influence of snowmelt infiltration and its previously documented impact on podzolization. Overstory vegetation may provide a strong, reinforcing influence or may be reacting in turn as a dependent variable to soil development and soil moisture during spring, as impacted directly by snowmelt infiltration.																			0361-5995	1435-0661				JUL-AUG	2002	66	4					1272	1284		10.2136/sssaj2002.1272	http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2002.1272													WOS:000176588300022
J	Stack, J				Stack, John			The Mississippi River Basin Compact: A New Governance Structure to Save the Mississippi River	MINNESOTA LAW REVIEW												The Mississippi River is one of the most significant and yet one of the most imperiled water bodies in the United States. It faces a myriad of problems, from rampant pollution, widespread flooding, wildlife habitat loss, and considerable droughts. Indeed, this is a critical time for the Mississippi River. Fall of 2023 saw River levels drop to extreme lows, with commercial barges grounded and cities deploying emergency measures to protect their municipal water intakes from saltwater intrusion. Meanwhile, polluted Mississippi River water created a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico spanning hundreds of square miles, just as it has every summer over the past few decades. Only months prior, record winter precipitation brought major flooding to cities along the upper part of the Mississippi. As demands on the River increase as climate change worsens and the population of the United States grows, these stresses will compound. Droughts will become more consequential, and floods will become more devastating. Impairments to barge traffic will have growing impacts on the economy of the whole United States. Thus, the window of time the country has to put in place preventative measures is slipping and a solution must be implemented quickly. This Note traces the issues facing the Mississippi back to a problem of governance. Existing state and federal initiatives have failed to make a marked dent in many of these problems by failing to work together in a consistent manner. States individually face a collective action problem, lacking the power or the will to effectuate solutions within their borders. The federal government under existing legislation has also been unable to regulate the Mississippi effectively and now has diminished authority to do so after Sackett v. EPA. . In the face of this interstitial power vacuum, this Note proposes a solution that passes legal muster: an interstate compact. Compacts between states are explicitly enshrined in the Constitution, favored by the Supreme Court, and have a track record of success when it comes to regulating water bodies. Specifically, the Great Lakes Water Compact and the Delaware River Basin Compact provide strong models for watershed governance that could well be scaled to the Mississippi River Basin. These compacts draw upon the legal authority of each sovereign signatory, harmonically regulating their respective waterbodies. This Note broadly outlines an interstate compact for the Mississippi River that combines the powers and interests of the states in the Mississippi River basin as well as the federal government, creating an interstate agency that has the legal authority necessary to effectuate proper and timely decisions. While not purporting to provide a silver bullet to the problems faced by the River, this Note argues that such an interstate compact is the best mechanism from which effective solutions can be borne to sustain this great American body of water for future generations.																			0026-5535						2024	108	5					2703	2753																WOS:001331695400007

Response of the Phytoplankton Community in an Alpine Lake to Drought Conditions: Colorado Rocky Mountain Front Range, USA	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Lakes may serve as sentinels for the impacts of changing climate in alpine areas. In the Rocky Mountain region, 2002 was a year with extremely low snowpack. We examined the summer phytoplankton community in Green Lake 4 for a 6-year period that included the summer of 2002. The phytoplankton community variation was examined in the context of the changes in physical and chemical properties of Green Lake 4. The physical changes associated with the 2002 drought included warmer surface water temperatures and greater hydraulic residence times; whereas the chemical changes included higher concentrations of acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) and major ions. During the summer of 2002 the phytoplankton community was dominated by Synedra sp. and Ankyra sp.; two previously rare species. The growth of Synedra sp. was sufficient to cause a decrease in silica concentrations, which has not been observed in other summers in the water quality monitoring record. The results of a redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that concentrations of major ions and ANC were aligned with Synedra sp. and Ankyra sp. during the 2002 drought year. Following the 2002 drought year, Chrysococcus sp. and Chlorococcum sp., which became abundant, were aligned with nitrate in the RDA. These results indicate that the response of the phytoplankton community to the extreme drought was most strongly correlated with water quality changes the occurred, rather than temperature and hydraulic residence time. The dominant species in the post-drought phytoplankton community were found to be associated with nitrate, which is brought to the watershed by atmospheric deposition and may represent an anthropogenic driver of phytoplankton community composition.					; Miller, Matthew/A-4928-2016	LIPTZIN, DANIEL/0000-0002-8243-267X; Flanagan Pritz, Colleen/0000-0002-0466-2103; Miller, Matthew/0000-0002-2537-1823; MCKNIGHT, DIANE/0000-0002-4171-1533													1523-0430	1938-4246				MAY	2009	41	2					191	203		10.1657/1938.4246-41.2.191	http://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1938.4246-41.2.191													WOS:000266252900005
J	SERVOS, MR; MACKIE, GL				SERVOS, MR; MACKIE, GL			THE EFFECT OF SHORT-TERM ACIDIFICATION DURING SPRING SNOWMELT ON SELECTED MOLLUSCA IN SOUTH-CENTRAL ONTARIO	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Limestone and sulfuric acid were used to manipulate the pH of water in three artificial channels in the outflow of Plastic Lake, south-central Ontario, during the spring of 1982. Using artificial channels allowed the manipulation of pH during a natural pH depression (i.e., spring snowmelt) while minimizing confounding factors such as mobilization of metals from aquatic sediments. Addition of sulfuric acid extended and exaggerated the natural pH depression (from pH 5.8 to 4.8) to as low as pH 3.5 over 5 days, while addition of limestone prevented depression of pH below 6.4. Survival and reproduction of the pisidiid clams Pisidium equilaterale Prime and Pisidium casertanum (Poli) and the hydrobiid snail Amnicola limosa Say held in artificial channels were not significantly different (p > 0.05) among treatments. The survival and reproduction of A. limosa was also not affected by exposure to short-term pH depressions (e.g., 5.8 to 4.8; 4.8 to 4.3) in three south-central Ontario streams during spring snowmelt. For various life stages of both P. equilaterale and A. limosa, 96-h LC50 values were below pH 4.0, which was well below the pH observed in any stream in this study. These results suggest that recruitment failure and elimination of A. limosa from acidifying lakes noted in other studies was not a direct result of short-term pH depression during snowmelt.

On the frequency of lake-effect snowfall in the Catskill Mountains	PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY					75th Eastern Snow Conference (ESC)	JUN 05-08, 2018	NOAA Ctr Weather & Climate Predict, Climate Predict Ctr, College Park, MD		NOAA Ctr Weather & Climate Predict, Climate Predict Ctr			Meltwater from snow that falls in the Catskill/Delaware watershed in the Catskill Mountains in south-central New York contributes to reservoirs that supply drinking water to approximately nine million people in and near New York City (NYC). Using the Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) 4-km snow maps from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Ice Center, we identified and tracked 28 lake-effect (LE) storms that deposited snow in the Catskills (2004-2017). These storms, which generally originated from Lake Ontario, but sometimes from Lake Erie, represent an underestimate of the number of LE storms that contribute snowfall to the Catskills snowpack because snowstorms are not visible on IMS maps when they travel over already-snow-covered terrain. Using satellite, meteorological (including NEXRAD and National Weather Service Cooperative Observer Program), and reanalysis data, we identified conditions that contributed to the LE snowstorms and mapped snow-cover extent (SCE) following the storms. We show that LE snow makes an important contribution to the Catskills snowpack because of the frequency of events, even though the total amount of each event may, on average, be small. The IMS 4-km maps tend to overestimate SCE compared to MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Landsat snow maps. Climate change could impact LE storms and the distribution of rain versus snow in the Catskills, which may affect future reservoir operations in the NYC Water Supply System and winter recreation in the Catskills.

J	FitzGerald, DM; Buynevich, IV; Davis, RA; Fenster, MS				FitzGerald, DM; Buynevich, IV; Davis, RA; Fenster, MS			New England tidal inlets with special reference to riverine-associated inlet systems	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Tidal inlets along the glaciated coast of New England exhibit a diverse morphology due to widely different physical and geological settings and sediment abundance. Except for the glacial sediment coasts of Cape Cod, Nantucket Island, and Martha's Vineyard, most regions of New England are rocky, and barrier and tidal inlet development is related to isolated glacial and riverine sediment supplies. Inlet-connected bays and marshes encompass many different origins, including drowned river valleys, glacial lake discharge channels, indented bedrock and glacial sediment coasts, kettles, and groundwater sapping channels. Generally, inlet size is correlated to tidal range; the largest inlets (width >300 m) occur along mesotidal coasts, whereas most inlets along microtidal coasts are small (width <100 m). Exceptions occur along microtidal coasts where large bay areas produce large tidal prisms. In spite of their diversity, New England tidal inlets can be grouped into three broad categories based on their morphology, hydrographic regime, and sediment transport characteristics. These classes include the wave-dominated and mixed-energy tidal inlets, and riverine-associated tidal inlets. Wave-dominated inlets tend to occur in microtidal settings and are found primarily in southern New England. They contain flood-tidal deltas of variable morphology and poorly developed or absent ebb-tidal deltas. They have histories of migration, closure, and reopening during storms. Mixed-energy tidal inlets occur mostly along the mesotidal shorelines of central and northern New England. These inlets exhibit well-developed ebb- and flood-tidal deltas. They are backed by extensive marshes and tidal creeks and, in some cases, by a broad system of tidal flats. Riverine-associated tidal inlets coincide with major rivers that have significant freshwater discharge, especially during late winter and early spring. The throat cross-sections are large in comparison to other inlets in New England and are a function of their tidal prism. They contain well-developed subtidal ebb-tidal deltas and variable developed flood-tidal deltas. Ebb-oriented bedforms, grain size, and mineralogical analyses of channel sediments, and hydraulic data have been used to demonstrate that the estuaries are exporting sand to the nearshore, a process that has likely been ongoing since deglaciation. The mechanism for downstream movement of sand in the estuaries is moderate to large spring freshets and major floods when freshwater discharge supplants the saltwater tidal prism. During these periods, there are unidirectional seaward currents in the estuaries that may last for several days or weeks. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Hydrological (in)stability in Southern Siberia during the Younger Dryas and early Holocene	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Southern Siberia is currently undergoing rapid warming, inducing changes in vegetation, loss of permafrost, and impacts on the hydrodynamics of lakes and rivers. Lake sediments are key archives of environmental change and contain a record of ecosystem variability, as well as providing proxy indicators of wider environmental and climatic change. Investigating how hydrological systems have responded to past shifts in climate can provide essential context for better understanding future ecosystem changes in Siberia. Oxygen isotope ratios within lacustrine records provide fundamental information on past variability in hydrological systems. Here we present a new oxygen isotope record from diatom silica (delta O-18(diatom)) at Lake Baunt (55 degrees 11'15 '' N, 113 degrees 01,45 '' E), in the southern part of eastern Siberia, and consider how the site has responded to climate changes between the Younger Dryas and Early to Mid Holocene (ca. 12.4 to 6.2 ka cal BP). Excursions in delta O-18(diatom) are influenced by air temperature and the seasonality, quantity, and source of atmospheric precipitation. These variables are a function of the strength of the Siberian High, which controls temperature, the proportion and quantity of winter versus summer precipitation, and the relative dominance of Atlantic versus Pacific air masses. A regional comparison with other Siberian delta O-18(diatom) records, from lakes Baikal and Kotokel, suggests that delta O-18(diatom) variations in southern Siberia reflect increased continentality during the Younger Dryas, delayed Early Holocene warming in the region, and substantial climate instability between similar to 10.5 to similar to 8.2 ka cal BP. Unstable conditions during the Early Holocene thermal optimum most likely reflect localised changes from glacial melting. Taking the profiles from three very different lakes together, highlight the influence of site specific factors on the indi-vidual records, and how one site is not indicative of the region as a whole. Overall, the study documents how sensitive this important region is to both internal and external forcing.					; Bezrukova, Elena/O-9114-2015; Tarasov, Pavel/ABG-3993-2020; Kostrova, Svetlana/AAF-7889-2021; Meyer, Hanno/E-2870-2016; Shtenberg, Mikhail/C-2255-2014; Shchetnikov, Alexander/L-1032-2017; Lacey, Jack/AAL-3601-2020	Harding, Poppy/0000-0002-2184-9455; Meyer, Hanno/0000-0003-4129-4706; Kostrova, Svetlana/0000-0003-1124-5559; Lacey, Jack H./0000-0002-6329-2149; Shtenberg, Mikhail/0000-0002-4795-4771; 													0921-8181	1872-6364				DEC	2020	195								103333	10.1016/j.gloplacha.2020.103333	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2020.103333													WOS:000592360800006

Here, for the first time, we use meteoric Be-10 isotope measurements performed on sediments from a drill core collected at the Kunlun Pass (KP) on the northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (NETP) to investigate hydroclimate changes during the Holocene. The Be-10 flux suggests relative low levels in the Early Holocene, followed by a sharp increase to high values at around 4 ka BP (4 ka BP - 4000 years before present). Afterwards, the Be-10 flux remains on a high level during the Late Holocene, but decreases slightly towards today. These Be-10 deposition patterns are compared to moisture changes in regions dominated by the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM), East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM), and the Westerlies. Different from the gradual changes in monsoon patterns, the Be-10 data reveal low levels during the Early Holocene until similar to 4 ka BP when an obvious increase is indicated and a relative high level continues to this day, which is relatively more in agreement with patterns of the Westerlies. This finding provides a new evidence fora shift in the dominant pattern of atmospheric circulation the KP region from a more monsoonal one to one dominated by the Westerlies. Our results improve the understanding of non-stationary interactions and spatial relevance of the EASM, the ISM and the Westerlies on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Nine sediment samples were taken below and above these lacustrine deposits to determine periods of changing lake level using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) applying a multiple-aliquot regeneration (MAR) protocol. According to facies and stratigraphy, samples below the carbonate banks indicate a rising and samples from above a falling lake level. The results indicate that the rising lake level of Tangra Yumco passed the sampling location at 10.5 and 2.1 ka while a falling lake level passed the sampling location at 0.9 ka. The rising lake level of Xuru Co passed the sampling location at 7.9 and 1.7 ka and a falling lake level at 0.5 ka showing a similar trend as at Tangra Yumco. Combining these results with recalculated cosmogenic nuclide ages and previously published feldspar luminescence data allows the establishment of a Holocene lake level reconstruction for Tangra Yumco, which is unique for the southern-central Tibetan Plateau. The lake level of Tangra Yumco crested a lake level highstand of 181-183m above the recent lake level prior to 8.5 ka and has generally fallen after 8.5 ka, with a minor lake level rise at 2.1 ka. Lake level variations at Tangra Yumco occur simultaneously with other lakes on the Tibetan Plateau indicating that variations were controlled by monsoonal dynamics with a moist early Holocene and a successive reduction of available moisture thereafter. The average rate of the lake level rise between 10.5 and 8.5 ka is at least 0.05m a(-1) (compared with a modern value of 0.38m a(-1)), providing valuable insights in the monsoonal impact on lake level change on the southern-central Tibetan Plateau.					; Haberzettl, Torsten/AAV-9216-2021; Zhu, Liping/AAC-4284-2022; Frenzel, Peter/F-5247-2012; Wang, Junbo/IVH-8446-2023	Haberzettl, Torsten/0000-0002-6975-9774; Zhu, Liping/0000-0002-4234-8748; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				FEB	2016	26	2					176	187		10.1177/0959683615596840	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683615596840													WOS:000368332200002

The cyanobacterial blooms primarily occupied the western region of Lake Chaohu, and the direction and speed of the prevailing wind determined the spatial distribution of these blooms. The cyanobacteria in Lake Chaohu were dominated by species of Microcystis and Anabaena. Microcystis reached its peak in June, and Anabaena had peaks in May and November, with an overall biomass that was higher than that of Microcystis. Microcystis generally occupied the western region of the lake in summer, whereas Anabaena dominated in other regions and seasons. Temperature may be responsible for these seasonal shifts. However, total phosphorus (TP), pH, temperature, turbidity and nitrate/nitrite nitrogen determined the coexistence of the two genera in different regions in summer. TP was correlated with Microcystis dominance, and pH and light availability were correlated with Anabaena dominance. Our results contribute to the understanding of shifts in bloom-forming cyanobacteria and are important for the control of cyanobacterial blooms.

Ten carbonate facies comprise the bulk of the tufas, which accumulated at spring vents, in swamps and shallow lakes, along fissures, and along fluvial channels. The tufas contain diatoms dominated by shallow-water, swamp and fluvial taxa associated with fresh to mildly saline conditions. delta C-13 isotopes are relatively enriched (0.25 to 1.96 parts per thousand) compared with other East African tufas, but uniform within each set of tufa deposits, suggesting similar sources of CO2 derived from similar plants and soil organic matter during each interval of deposition. 8130 ranges from -7.17 parts per thousand to +5.16 parts per thousand suggesting variable evaporation and rainfall/groundwater sources or changing water temperatures. Variable REE patterns suggest spatial and/or temporal contrasts in groundwater chemistry. The former springs may have developed in response to climate changes, but there are no clear correlations with known East African wet phases. The deposition of tufa probably also relates to basin breakup and faulting, which likely influenced groundwater movements. Increased permineralized silica in plants in tufas and non-carbonate sediments reflects the introduction of deeper groundwaters than those during earlier Olorgesailie Formation times. Whether climatically or tectonically controlled, the tufa spring sites would have provided a supply of potable water, at least intermittently, during the Pleistocene, and would have provided attractive places for wildlife and possibly for Middle Stone Age human inhabitants of the region, especially during relatively dry times.

However, seagrass ecosystems face the looming threat of degradation, necessitating effective monitoring. Remote -sensing technology offers significant advantages in terms of spatial coverage and temporal accessibility. Although some remote sensing approaches, such as water column correction, spectral index -based, and machine learning -based methods, have been proposed for seagrass detection, their performances are not always satisfactory. Deep learning models, known for their powerful learning and vast data processing capabilities, have been widely employed in automatic target detection. In this study, a typical seagrass habitat (Swan Lake) in northern China was used to propose a deep learning -based model for seagrass detection from Landsat satellite data. The performances of UNet and SegNet at different patch scales for seagrass detection were compared. The results showed that the SegNet model at a patch scale of 16 x 16 pixels worked well, with validation accuracy and loss of 96.3 % and 0.15, respectively, during training. Evaluations based on the test dataset also indicated good performance of this model, with an overall accuracy >95 %. Subsequently, the deep learning model was applied for seagrass detection in Swan Lake between 1984 and 2022. We observed a noticeable seasonal variation in germination, growth, maturation, and shrinkage from spring to winter. The seagrass area decreased over the past four decades, punctuated by intermittent fluctuations likely attributed to anthropogenic activities, such as aquaculture and construction development. Additionally, changes in landscape ecology indicators have demonstrated that seagrass experiences severe patchiness. However, these problems have weakened recently. Overall, by combining remote sensing big data with deep learning technology, our study provides a valuable approach for the highly precise monitoring of seagrass. These findings on seagrass area variation in Swan Lake offer significant information for seagrass restoration and management.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				APR 1	2024	919								170936	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170936	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170936		FEB 2024						38360328					WOS:001188078700001

Major postglacial summer temperature changes in the central coniferous boreal forest of Quebec (Canada) inferred using chironomid assemblages	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Chironomid head capsules preserved in lake sediments were used to reconstruct 8200 years of summer temperatures in the boreal forest of north-eastern Canada. Two training sets were used derived from Canadian and Eastern Canadian transfer functions. Both models reconstructed similar climate patterns, but the Canadian model provided temperatures generally 2-3 degrees C lower than the Eastern Canadian model. Three main thermal changes inferred by chironomids were: (i) the Holocene Thermal Maximum, which occurred between 8 and 5 k cal a BP, with temperatures generally higher than today's, maximum temperatures between 8 and 6.5 k cal a BP, and an average of +0.9 degrees C; (ii) the Medieval Climate Anomaly around 1.1-1.2 k cal a BP with an amplitude of + 0.7 degrees C; and (iii) a colder period reconstructed between the 14 th and 19 th centuries, corresponding to the Little Ice Age, with summer temperatures on average -0.5 degrees C lower than the climate normal. For each of these three climatic events, the timing and the amplitude of changes were similar with other published regional, North American and Northern Hemisphere records.

Investigation of the pelagic bottom deposits revealed hybernating cyclops of fifth copepodite stage. The cyclops in the condition of diapause were found at the sites with soft bottom untouched by outflowing currents. Diapause is assumed to regulate the abundance of C. scutifer and ensure the resistance of the species to unfavourable environmental conditions during the winter period.

Occurrence and Environmental Distribution of 5 UV Filters During the Summer Season in Different Water Bodies	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Organic UV filters are used worldwide in various personal care products as well as textiles, paints, plastic, food, and adhesives. They are main ingredients in sunscreen lotions that are used heavily by beachgoers in the summer season. There is thus an increasing concern regarding the fate of organic UV filters in the environment and their impact on living organisms. Many of the UV filters in use are hydrophobic and are expected to accumulate in the sediment phase in aquatic systems, but this has yet to be validated in situ. We targeted the UV filters benzophenone 3 (BP3), butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (BMDBM), diethylhexyl butamido triazone (DBT), bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine (BEMT), and methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol (MBBT) in a freshwater lake and in a coastal bay in order to understand their distribution during summer 2016. Further, we examined their environmental partitioning by collecting samples from the surface water, the sediment phase, and water surface microlayer (SML). We show for the first time the presence of DBT, BEMT, and MBBT in environmental matrices (water, SML, and sediment). Notably, these UV filters were detected at low amounts in surface waters with maximum concentrations of 9.9ng/L for DBT, 18.4ng/L for BEMT, and below detection limits for MBBT and somewhat higher concentrations in the SML, with maximum concentrations of 43.3ng/L for DBT, 5625.4ng/L for BEMT, and 45.6ng/L for MBBT. These filters were detected at even greater concentrations in the sediments, with maximum concentrations of 652.6ng/g for DBT, 115.0ng/g for BEMT, and 75.2ng/g for MBBT (dry weight sediment). We also performed controlled laboratory experiments to determine their partitioning behavior, and we verified the actual solubility of many of the filters. This will help in determining the environmental fate and finally lead to a better risk assessment of these compounds. Together, these results corroborate the hypothesis that hydrophobic UV filters accumulate in the sediment phase and highlight the importance of discerning whether these UV filters impact the benthic community and their potential for bioaccumulation.					; Fagervold, Sonja/G-5609-2013; Rodrigues, Anderson/V-4069-2019	Stien, Didier/0000-0002-9950-5361; Lebaron, Philippe/0000-0002-8520-9078; Rodrigues, Alice/0000-0001-7671-1261													0049-6979	1573-2932				JUL	2019	230	7							172	10.1007/s11270-019-4217-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-019-4217-7													WOS:000475632700006
J	Wang, Y; Consi, TR; Hansen, T; Janssen, J				Wang, Yu; Consi, Thomas R.; Hansen, Tom; Janssen, John			The relationship between coastal Mysis diluviana abundance and spring thermal bar dynamics	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We studied the density and age structure of Mysis diluviana in Lake Michigan with respect to spatial structure relating to spring thermal bar dynamics. The thermal bar is a zone of sinking 4 degrees C water that separates warmer inshore water from colder offshore water. The thermal bar migrates offshore as inshore water warms. The density of Mysis did not differ statistically between inshore (about 6 degrees C, as shallow as 17 m bottom depth) and offshore of the spring thermal bar, but the percentage of Mysis that were juveniles (<10 mm length) was significantly higher inshore (P = 0.011). Our data suggested that inshore Mysis may have an advantage in growth, but an impact on the entire population is unlikely. This study has important implications for both the predators and competitors of Mysis. First, the thermal bar period may be the most extended time that M. diluviana and the invasive Hemimysis anomala overlap spatially. Second, at the only well-studied Great Lakes lake trout nursery, a Lake Superior shallow reef, juvenile Mysis are important prey for lake trout fry (Salvelinus namaycush) which emerge and begin feeding in spring. Our study shows that Mysis are often abundant in coastal Lake Michigan water during the period when the lake begins to warm. Hence, lake trout restoration efforts for coastal spawning areas of the other Great Lakes may have potential Mysis-based nursery grounds essentially "on site," at or adjacent to spawning reefs.

Preserved ruminant dung from archaeological layers offers a unique possibility for the reconstruction of past fodder management strategies, and further for studying the impact of fodder acquisition and pasturing on forests. In this case study we investigate the impact of Late Neolithic livestock keeping on the forest around the "Mooswinkel" pile dwelling at the Austrian lake Mondsee through the analysis of botanical macroremains, insect remains as well as microhistological analyses of botanical remains in animal dung. Seasonal plant parts in the dung point out that cattle, goats, and/or sheep were evidently kept inside the settlement during the winter for protection. During the daytime, they were allowed to forage around the settlement. Winter fodder consisted of dried leaf hay, hay from grasses and herbs, male flowers of early blooming bushes, and fresh twigs of evergreen species, such as fir (Abies alba), ivy (Hedera helix), and mistletoe (Viscum album).					; Heiss, Andreas G./K-5393-2013; Heiss, Andreas/K-5393-2013; Rosner, Sabine/AAE-9211-2022	Jakobitsch, Thorsten/0000-0001-9951-7445; Heiss, Andreas G./0000-0002-2989-7259; Dworsky, Cyril/0000-0001-7044-5898; Rosner, Sabine/0000-0003-1708-096X													1866-9557	1866-9565				MAR	2023	15	3							20	10.1007/s12520-023-01724-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12520-023-01724-5													WOS:000926049500001

Significance of natural treatment systems to enhance reuse of treated effluent: A critical assessment	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												This paper summarizes the results of the recently completed India-wide survey of 108 wastewater treatment facilities based on natural treatment systems (NTSs) engaged in wastewater treatment and reuse. During assessment of NTSs, a questionnaire survey was administered for collection of vital data on the shortlisted 41 treatment facilities - especially to obtain insights about the technical, economical and social issues influencing the success and failure of the given facility. Further, five case studies based on the most commonly practiced NTSs were selected for in-depth evaluation and the critical issues including effectiveness of technology and the socioeconomic aspects were studied. The treatment performance of these systems was assessed for one year by collecting primary data during January, June and August corresponding to the three seasons viz. winter, summer and monsoon. The effectiveness of the facilities was assessed in terms of percentage removals as well as the mass removal rate for commonly used parameters. As of today, the total load of sewges including sullages serviced by NTSs in India adds up to be around 1838 million liters a day. The most commonly practiced NTS in India has been the waste stabilization ponds (74 facilities) when compared with the phyto-remediation based systems (19 facilities) followed by the polishing ponds (15 facilities). Among the 41 facilities, nearly 75% facilities were compliant and managed to produce treated sewages suitable for irrigation, discharged into wastewater canals or percolated in the riparian zone of the river. All the five systems that were selected for in-depth evaluation were found compliant during assessment. Also, two facilities (Sewage-fed Aquaculture Karnal and Duckweed Pond Ludhiana) were found to be operating on the public private partnership model and generating revenue for operation and maintenance along with ample benefits to the operating agencies. The study also reveals the associated socioeconomic benefits of various practiced NTSs. Finally, strategies for achieving improved performance of NTSs were articulated - especially focusing the potential for recycling and reusing of treated wastewaters. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated the effects of herbicide use (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, diquat dibromide, copper-ethylenediamine complex) and vegetation reduction on movements and population characteristics of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides at six sites (5-10 hectares) in this 27,479-hectare impoundment. Fish were sampled by electrofishing, and relative vegetation density was monitored periodically through a 100-d period in late summer and fall of 1989. The locations and movements of 29 largemouth bass were monitored at four study sites with radiotelemetry. Three sites were treated with herbicides applied from airboats, and three control sites were traversed by airboats to simulate herbicide application. Largemouth bass catch rates (catch/1,000 s of electrofishing) did not change in response to herbicide treatment; mean total length of largemouth bass did not differ by site or time relative to herbicide treatment. Largemouth bass condition declined during the study period, and the rate of decline did not differ among sites. Movements of radio-marked largemouth bass were limited (< 300 m) and largely confined to the study sites. Differences among sites, herbicide treatments, and vegetation density had no measurable effect on the movements of largemouth bass. Overall, the results of this study provide no evidence that localized herbicide applications changed the abundance, size structure, condition, or movement of largemouth bass.																			0002-8487					JAN	1992	121	1					94	103		10.1577/1548-8659(1992)121<0094:EOAPCO>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1992)121<0094:EOAPCO>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1992HR39900009

Type of litter and depth of water were the most important factors regulating the rate of decomposition. The percentage composition of cellulose and hemicellulose showed little variation and only a minor fall was noted in their values towards the end of the study period. The lignin percentage increased steadily at all the stations except the deepest station. The sugar and amino acid concentration dropped appreciably during the initial phase and stabilized during later periods. The general trend of change in N percentage was initial fall-increase-fall-stabilization at a near original value. The rate of decompositon was faster when compared with similar studies in Canada and Europe.

MODERN TRAVERTINE PRECIPITATION AT LYSUHOLL HOT SPRINGS, SNAEFELLNES, ICELAND: IMPLICATIONS FOR CALCITE CRYSTAL GROWTH	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												Three thermal springs, at Lysuholl on Sn ae fellnes Peninsula on the west coast of Iceland, with vent water temperatures of 20 to 46 degrees C are characterized by thriving microbial mats that mediate the precipitation of opal-A, Fe-rich opal-A, Fe-rich reticulate coatings, and calcite that are intermixed with each other at micro-to macro-scales. Although many of the microbes are preserved by silicification, there is no evidence of preservation by calcification. The calcite crystals that grew in the confines of the microbial mats, despite not being perfectly formed and, 1 mm long, can be divided into prismatic forms (types I to III), trigonal prisms, dodecahedrons, plates, rhombic forms (types I to III), and dendrites. Apart from the dendrites, all of the other crystals are mesocrystals formed of nanocrystals that are aligned in perfect crystallographic registers. All of these crystals grew through the non-classical crystal growth model, which is a particle-based system. In this case, the growth of the nanocrystals and the development of the mesocrystals took place in the microdomains that developed in the biofilms. Recognition of this type of crystal growth in older spring deposits may be difficult because (1) the mesocrystals may be transformed to monocrystals by fusion of the nanocrystals, (2) evidence of the microbes and biofilms may be missing because they are commonly lost to decay before preservation by calcification can take place, and/or (3) these mesocrystals may become the main nucleation centers for larger calcite crystals that grow via the classical crystal growth model. Irrespective of these nuances, the possibility that calcite crystals initially developed as mesocrystals should be a critical consideration in the evaluation of any spring system where calcite is being precipitated.

J	Regnell, O; Ewald, G; Lord, E				Regnell, O; Ewald, G; Lord, E			Factors controlling temporal variation in methyl mercury levels in sediment and water in a seasonally stratified lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Total mercury (total Hg) levels were low in the water (2.5-7.5 pM) and in the sediment (150-300 pmol g (DW)(-1)), indicating an absence of significant local sources of Hg. During summer stratification, methyl mercury (MeHg) levels increased below the thermocline, reaching 2.5 pM in the anoxic hypolimnion, whereas;in the epilimnion levels remained low (0.25-0.6 pM) throughout the study period (late April-late October 1993). On October 27 (the last sampling date), the lake was totally mixed and MeHg in the entire water column had returned to low levels. Within the part of the basin turning anoxic during summer stratification, the MeHg levels in the surficial sediment (0-0.5 cm) and those in the overlying water were negatively correlated (r-= -0.87, P < 0.05). Sediment MeHg decreased during summer stratification until August and then increased. In the sediment, total organic carbon was significantly correlated with total Hg (r = 0.86, P < 0.05), MeHg (r = 0.90, P < 0.01), and total Mn (r = 0.88, P < 0.01). A mechanism for the partitioning of MeHg between water and sediment is discussed, involving the Mn redox cycle. Budget calculations indicated that exchanges of a fixed amount of MeHg between the water and sediment could not explain the observed seasonal Variation in MeHg levels. Other processes that may have contributed to the variation in MeHg levels in the sediment and water are methylation, demethylation, mass dilution, and uptake of MeHg in the biota.																			0024-3590					DEC	1997	42	8					1784	1795		10.4319/lo.1997.42.8.1784	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1997.42.8.1784													WOS:000073407700014

Lawrence; Cheng, Hai			Early-Holocene monsoon instability and climatic optimum recorded by Chinese stalagmites	HOLOCENE												The timing and duration of the Holocene East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) maximum and the interpretation of Chinese stalagmite delta O-18 records have long been disputed. Notably, interpretations of Holocene EASM variations are frequently based on a single record or study area and are often contradictory. In this study, we conducted stable isotope analyses of four Holocene stalagmites from Chongqing, southwest China. The results reveal differences in the timing of the Holocene EASM maximum and to try to resolve the inconsistency we analyzed and statistically integrated a total of 16 Holocene stalagmite records from 14 caves in the EASM region. The resulting synthesized Holocene stalagmite delta O-18 (delta O-18(syn)) record is in agreement with other EASM records and confirms that stalagmite delta O-18 records are a valid indicator of EASM intensity, rather of local precipitation amount. The delta O-18(syn) record shows that the EASM intensified rapidly from the onset of the early Holocene; notably, however, there were distinct EASM oscillations in the early Holocene, consisting of three abrupt millennial-scale events. This indicates that, contrary to several previous interpretations, the early Holocene EASM was unstable. Subsequently, during 8-6 kyr BP, the EASM was relatively stable and strong, with the strongest monsoon occurring during 8-7 kyr BP. This evidence of a stable and strong mid-Holocene EASM in eastern China is in accord with the classical view of a mid-Holocene Optimum in China.

Appropriate direct calorimetric techniques were applied to: (i) measure the heat energy dissipated by the mat community and by the free bacterioplankton in the water column below it; and (ii) differentiate between the heat flows by the heterotrophic and the phototrophic components of the community. It was shown that Cladophora biomass reached a peak of 579.5 g C m(-2), contributing more than 99.6% of the total mat community. Throughout the spring, the total bacterial energy transfer (6 to 23 mW m(-2)) was as little as 1.1 to 2.6% of the total heat dissipated by the microplankton community. The rest of the estimated heat energy (584 to 1488 mW m(-2)) was associated with Cladophora metabolism. In the spring community: (i) the rate of biomass accumulation in the lake photic layer significantly exceeded its heterotrophic mineralisation; (ii) the efficiency of the microbial loop was too low to process even a minor part of the accumulated organic matter. The microcalorimetric technique was shown to be a highly promising approach for further studies of natural microbial mats and biofilms, biological systems with complex metabolism that involves not only aerobic processes but also anaerobic catabolism under local hypoxic/microxic conditions.

J	Mensing, SA				Mensing, SA			Late-Glacial and Early Holocene vegetation and climate change near Owens Lake, eastern California	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Pollen and algae from Owens Lake in eastern California provide evidence for a series of climatic oscillations late in the last glaciation. Juniper woodland, which dominated the Owens Valley from 16,200 to 15,500 cal yr B.P., suggests much wetter conditions than today. Although still wetter and cooler than today, the area then became fairly warm and dry, with woodland being replaced by shrubs (mainly sagebrush) from 15,500 to 13,100 cal yr B.P. Next, Chenopodiaceae (shadscale) increased, woody species declined, and lake levels fell-all evidence for a brief(ca. 100-200 yr) drought about 13,000 cal yr B.P. The climate continued to oscillate between wet and dry from 13,000 to 11,000 cal yr B.P. After 11,000 cal yr B.P., low lake levels and the increased dominance of desert shrubs indicate the beginning of warm, dry Holocene conditions. The region's climate was unstable during the Younger Dryas but uncertainities in dating prevent identification of the Younger Dryas interval in the Owens Lake record. Comparison of the Owens Lake record with studies in the Sierra Nevada and Great Basin suggest that the climate was generally wetter between 13,000 and 11,000 cal yr B.P., with warmer summers, although no consistent pattern of climate change emerges.

J	STAUFFER, RE; ARMSTRONG, DE				STAUFFER, RE; ARMSTRONG, DE			CYCLING OF IRON, MANGANESE, SILICA, PHOSPHORUS, CALCIUM AND POTASSIUM IN 2 STRATIFIED BASINS OF SHAGAWA LAKE, MINNESOTA	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Geochemical studies of Fe, Mn, Si, P, Ca, and K were made in two basins of Shagwa Lake, Minnesota during summers 1977-1979. Within the metalimnion, upward and laterally diffusing Fe(II) oxidizes and co-precipitates a large fraction of soluble P. Nevertheless, the soluble Fe/P ratio decreases while progressing upward through the oxidation zone. The mean particulare Fe/Si ratio is 3.0 .+-. 0.5 in the thermocline, but because of the stoichiometric excess of dissolved Si over Fe, and preferential associations between Fe and P, the oxidation of Fe has a negligible effect on the dissolved SiO2 profiles. The lake sediments are net sources of Ca, K, and P during summer stratification. These elements are transported upward through the thermocline and exported from the lake. Despite the very active sediment release of dissolved SiO2, and upward transport through the thermocline, the lake acts as a net sink for biogenic opal in summer. The prominent soluble Mn maxima in the thermocline of the east basin result from antecedent sediment release (Mn2+) and vertical transport (primarily in the west basin), followed by dispersion and oxidation in the epilimnion, and finally downward settling and dissolution within the east basin thermocline. Rhodochrosite solubility does not influence Mn2+ profile development. Very large percentage increases in epilimnetic Fe, Mn, Si, and P occur simultaneously during episodes of wind-activated entrainment of metalimnion water. These increases are in stoichiometric agreement with the entrained water mass, provided account is also taken of the performed slurries overlying the metalimnetic shelf sediments in mid-summer. The bathylimnetic soluble Fe/P ratio remains low since the cultural inputs of P were terminated in early 1973. This geochemical stability is explained by the large reserve of potentially mobile P in the upper post-cultural sediments. Phosphorus release from these sediments and transport phenomena account for the persistent eutrophic condition of the lake during mid-late summer, despite the 80% reduction in external P loading.																			0016-7037	1872-9533				FEB	1986	50	2					215	229		10.1016/0016-7037(86)90171-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(86)90171-7													WOS:A1986A096000004

Study focus: Potential for downstream delivery of contaminants via Athabasca River floodwaters to lakes of the PAD has raised local to international concern. Here, we quantify enrichment of eight metals (Be, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, V, Zn) in aquatic biota, relative to sediment-based pre-industrial baselines, via analysis of biofilm-sediment mixtures accrued on artificial substrate samplers deployed during summers of 2017 and 2018 in > 40 lakes. Widespread flooding in the southern portion of the delta in spring 2018 allows for assessment of metal enrichment by Athabasca River floodwaters. New hydrological insights: River floodwaters are not implicated as a pathway of metal enrichment to biofilm-sediment mixtures in PAD lakes from upstream sources. MANOVA tests revealed no significant difference in residual concentrations of all eight metals in lakes that did not flood versus lakes that flooded during one or both study years. Also, no enrichment was detected for concentrations of biologically inert metals (Be, Cr, Pb) and those related to oil-sands development (Ni, V). Enrichment of Cd, Cu, and Zn at non-flooded lakes, however, suggests uptake of biologically active metals complicates comparisons of organic-rich biofilm-sediment mixtures to sediment-derived baselines for these metals. Results demonstrate that this novel approach could be adopted for lake monitoring within the federal Action Plan.

In addition, sequential oxygen isotope analyses along the growth spiral of the shell provides indications of seasonal variability in the life span of the organisms. Such data were collected for some freshwater gastropods collected from two lakes and two springs in the Afar region of Ethiopia, spanning late Pleistocene to modern age. Episodes of high rainfall in the Ethiopian highlands were clearly evident in the depleted .delta.18O values in some shells, while arid spells produced enriched levels in others. Hot springs introduced an added complication to the isotope record. This study, on a region of particularly complex hydrology and highly variable environmental history, indicates the utility of stable isotope analyses as proxies for past climates, but also emphasizes the problems involved.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				NOV 30	1989	74	3-4					265	278		10.1016/0031-0182(89)90065-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(89)90065-5													WOS:A1989CE14000006
J	Hammarlund, D; Björck, S; Buchardt, B; Israelson, C; Thomsen, CT				Hammarlund, D; Björck, S; Buchardt, B; Israelson, C; Thomsen, CT			Rapid hydrological changes during the Holocene revealed by stable isotope records of lacustrine carbonates from Lake Igelsjon, southern Sweden	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A Holocene sediment sequence from Lake Igelsjon, south central Sweden, was studied by stable oxygen- and carbon-isotope analyses of different carbonate components. The deposit, which covers the time-span from ca 11,500 cal BP to the present, was laid down in a small, kettle-hole lake, the hydrological balance of which is presently dominated by groundwater flow. Isotopic records obtained on bulk carbonates originating mainly from summer-produced, calcitic algal encrustations exhibit several rapid shifts of more than 2parts per thousand, likely reflecting pronounced hydrological variations. Corresponding isotopic data obtained on calcitic gastropod opercula from parts of the profile show subdued responses to major climatic shifts, probably related to an extended calcification season. The isotopic records were complemented by studies of modern isotope hydrology, and our interpretations are based on a simplistic climate-hydrology model in which variations in groundwater generation within the lake catchment produce changes in groundwater level and related adjustments of lake level and surface/volume ratio of the basin during the ice-free season. Assumed periods of decreased lake volume in a relatively dry climate (low lake level) are characterised by enrichment in O-18 and C-13 resulting from increased evaporation/inflow ratio and atmospheric equilibration, respectively. In clear contrast to this situation, intervals of more humid climatic conditions give rise to increased lake volume (high lake level), possibly surface over flow, and relatively depleted isotopic ratios. Relatively humid conditions, which may correlate to a wide-spread cooling event recorded by various proxies across the North Atlantic region, are indicated by distinct isotopic shifts at ca 8300 and 8000 cal BP, bracketing a period of O-18-depletion. The period between ca 8000 and 4000 cal BP was characterised by relatively dry and stable climatic conditions, whereas the subsequent part of the Holocene experienced a more humid and variable climate following marked and coherent depletions in O-18 and C-13 at ca 4000 cal BP.

The present study provides new insights and understanding of the social impact of the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics on Heber Valley. Using the well-established systemic model of community and quantitative survey data from 1999 until 2003, as well as waves from 2007, 2012, and 2018 data, we investigate, first, if community attachment, satisfaction, and desirability changed over time and, second, how enduring feelings about the Olympics affected community sentiment. Our research finds that there were some changes in residents' community experience over time; community attachment decreased during 2018, community satisfaction decreased in 2001, 2007, and 2018, and community desirability increased slightly in 2002.

J	Zielinski, GA				Zielinski, GA			A classification scheme for winter storms in the eastern and central United States with an emphasis on nor'easters	BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												A classification scheme for nor'easters and other winter storms (November-April) in the eastern and central United States provides real-time information on die potential impact of these storms. This scheme also may be applied to winter storms over the last century to provide a time series of trends and cycles in specific magnitude nor'easters along the East Coast and Colorado lows that migrate northward toward the Great Lakes (i.e., Witches of November). The classification scheme follows a 1-5 hierarchy with category 1 storms being the least severe and category 5 storms the most severe. Winter storm/nor'easter category is determined through the development of an intensity index (1) from surface synoptic charts. The 1-5 scale classification scheme of die storm's intensity is determined from the sum of central low pressure difference from 1013 mb, the deepening rate (millibars per 12 hours) and the maximum pressure gradient in millibars per 1000 kilometers. A five-scale (1-5) duration factor (DF), inversely related to the storm's forward speed, is combimed with intensity in the classification scheme in the form I.DF. The DF takes into account the potential for high precipitation totals (snow or rain depending on storm track) from slow-moving weal, to moderate storms. This twofold categorization allows a general estimation of potential snowfall/rain amounts and rates, wind speed, and the impact on communities (i.e,, infrastructure, schools, businesses) with different intensity and storm duration. Impact on marine/coastal interests along the eastern seaboard and in the Great Lakes region also may be inferred from this classification scheme.																			0003-0007					JAN	2002	83	1					37	+		10.1175/1520-0477(2002)083<0037:ACSFWS>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0477(2002)083<0037:ACSFWS>2.3.CO;2													WOS:000173428600008

Collapse and recovery of the European smelt (Osmerus eperlanus) population in a small boreal lake - an early warning of the consequences of climate change	BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												We used warm summer temperatures as an analogue of climate change to estimate the potential impacts on a population of smelt (Osmerus eperlanus) in a boreal lake. A combination of hydroacoustics, seine and gillnet catches with temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles was used to study the changes in the abundance, vertical distribution and age structure of the smelt population. Smelt were squeezed between their temperature and dissolved oxygen tolerance limits during most summers. Conditions in 2002 were, however, extreme and mean surface-water temperatures exceeded 21 degrees C while at the same time waters below 6 m had low (< 0.5 mg l(-1)) dissolved oxygen concentration. Pelagic fish density during summer declined from 5000 to 200 fish ha(-1). However, some young-of-the-year smelt survived in 2002, leading to a recovery in abundance to 4500 fish ha(-1) by 2004. A similar recovery is not likely if the high temperature and low oxygen conditions persist during critical periods over a generation time.

J	Richter, N; Russell, JM; Garfinkel, J; Huang, YS				Richter, Nora; Russell, James M.; Garfinkel, Johanna; Huang, Yongsong			Impacts of Norse settlement on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in Southwest Iceland	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Norse colonization of North Atlantic islands in the 1st millennium of the Common Era led to drastic prehistoric environmental changes in these previously "pristine" landscapes. In Iceland, Norse settlement is associated with a rapid decline in birch trees and heightened soil erosion, yet the timing of Norse exploration in the North Atlantic coincided with large climate changes that also influenced Icelandic environments. To date, there are few records that disentangle climatic and human impacts on terrestrial ecosystems, and there has been very little work on the impacts of Norse arrival on Iceland's aquatic ecosystems. Here we use a high-resolution lake-sediment record from Vestra Gislholtsvatn (VGHV), southwest Iceland to investigate these processes during the last 2,000 years. Norse arrival (c. 870 CE) in Iceland is followed by a rapid increase in sedimentation rate and a transition in leaf wax n-alkanes indicating a decrease in trees and expansion of grasses. This transition coincides with limnological changes, including increased primary productivity (i.e. C(17)n-alkane and biogenic opal fluxes) and shifts in the haptophyte algal community. Many of these changes are still apparent today. Comparisons with a new winter-spring alkenone temperature reconstruction from VGHV and marine sea surface temperature records show little to no correlation between terrestrial and aquatic ecological changes and climate at this time. Similarly, volcanic eruptions recorded in VGHV are not associated with any long-term environmental changes. Rather, the VGHV record suggests that human settlement had a lasting impact on the catchment area of VGHV and changes within the lake ecosystem.

Analyses of lake records from Europe show that there are regionally-coherent patterns of change in lake status (a qualitative index of changes in water depth, area or volume) through the Holocene, reflecting climatically-induced. changes in regional water budgets. Rapid changes in lake status occur in many regions of Europe between 9500-9000, 7500-7000 and 4500-4000 yr BP This apparent synchroneity in the timing of changes, although the direction varies from region to region, indicates that the changes in lake status are driven by changes in regional water balance caused by major reorganisations of the atmospheric circulation. Modelling studies indicate that changes in precipitation are the most important cause of changes in lake behaviour across Europe, because the lake water balance in temperate humid regions is largely controlled by runoff from the catchment. Changes in winter precipitation produce a much larger change in runoff and hence in lake response, than changes during the summer growing season. Sensitivity to precipitation changes is enhanced where solar radiation receipts are high: a given change in precipitation will therefore produce a larger response in the lake water balance in southern and eastern Europe than in northern or western Europe. The sensitivity of the lake water balance to changes in precipitation is dependent on the ratio of lake area to catchment area: sensitivity increases as the ratio becomes larger. The lake area to catchment area ratio at which a lake become sensitive varies with the magnitude of the precipitation change. Lake studies have the potential to contribute significantly to documenting and explaining Holocene climate changes across Europe. Continued improvements to the existing lake data base (including improvements to the lake chronologies), coupled with the application of geostatistical and modelling techniques will be required in order to exploit these archives fully.					; Vassiljev, Jüri/J-2597-2018; Wefer, Gerold/S-2291-2016; Vassiljev, Juri/J-2597-2018; Harrison, Sandy/ADX-4692-2022	Harrison, Sandy/0000-0001-5687-1903; Wefer, Gerold/0000-0002-6803-2020; Vassiljev, Juri/0000-0002-1518-2041; 															3-540-43201-9				2002							191	204																WOS:000177315300013
J	Fawley, KP; Fawley, MW				Fawley, Karen P.; Fawley, Marvin W.			Observations on the diversity and ecology of freshwater Nannochloropsis (Eustigmatophyceae), with descriptions of new taxa	PROTIST												The genus Nannochloropsis is well known from the marine environment but has only recently been reported from fresh and brackish waters. A single species, N. limnetica, was first documented from shallow lakes in Germany, where it produced spring blooms. A second unnamed isolate from a river in the United States has been characterized by sequence analysis and light microscopy. All of the Nannochloropsis species that have been described, both marine and freshwater, are small spheres with essentially no distinguishing morphological characteristics. Therefore, they must be characterized using molecular techniques. We have cultured numerous isolates of Nannochloropsis from a series of lakes on the James River in the Arrowwood National Wildlife Refuge, North Dakota, USA, and 1 isolate from a pond in Itasca State Park, Minnesota, USA. The diversity among these isolates was determined by light microscopy and DNA sequence analysis. Seven distinct haplotypes of Nannochloropsis were found, one of which possesses 18S rDNA and rbcL sequences identical to those of N. limnetica from Europe. The 6 new haplotypes vary in rbcL sequences and some are morophologically distinct from each other and from N. limnetica. These types are described as the new taxa N. limnetica var. globosa, N. limnetica var. irregularis, N. limnetica var. dystrophica, and N. limnetica var. gutta. All of the Nannochloropsis isolates from Arrowwood and Itasca were cultured only from samples taken during cold-water periods. These results suggest that Nannochloropsis species may be better adapted to cold water conditions, including temperatures near 0 degrees C and ice cover. (c) 2007 Elsevier GmbH.

For fish, a host of studies have found a strong correlation between aquatic vegetation abundance, fish density, and species richness, and postulate that this positive effect is due primarily to aquatic vegetation providing refuge from predation. However, detailed behavioural examination of how different fish species use aquatic vegetation and the mechanisms behind the resulting general positive impact are lacking. To address this knowledge gap, detailed real-time video analysis of behaviours of fish using aquatic vegetation was conducted along with seasonal line census surveys of aquatic vegetation and fish in Lake Nojiri, Japan, which is currently dominated by an invasive piscivore smallmouth bass. The aquatic plant community comprised five native species, which generally increased in density in late summer and autumn, and the fish community was comprised of three native and four invasive species. Overall, aquatic plant density was found to have a positive effect on total fish density. Fish behaviour analysis showed that aquatic plant density was negatively associated with total foraging effort across all fish species. However, a notable behavioural change was observed in young-of-the-year individuals (goby and bluegill) in the presence of a potential predator (primarily smallmouth bass), as both species shifted from frequent water column foraging with body positions suspended above the aquatic vegetation to infrequent aquatic plant stalk foraging with body positions near the aquatic vegetation. These results indicate that the positive effects of aquatic vegetation refuge likely outweigh the negative effects of aquatic plant density on fish foraging, leading to the observed overall positive effect of aquatic plant density on fish density. Consequently, patchy aquatic vegetation habitats with varying plant densities in close proximity are likely valuable foraging grounds for juvenile fish as they are able to forage in the water column at high rates when predators are absent but can quickly retreat to adjacent vegetation cover when predators arrive.

Stratification, sulfide, worms, and decline of the Eared Grebe (Podiceps nigricollis) at the Salton Sea, California	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Over the last half century the Salton Sea has been an important migratory stopover site for the Eared Grebe (Podiceps nigricollis). However, in recent years there have been sporadic mass mortalities (i.e., 150,000 in 1992) and a great reduction in the number of grebes visiting during the winter. We propose that a worsening food supply is causing the decline and that starvation may be a major cause of the unexplained mortalities. While at the Sea, grebes forage almost exclusively on a benthic polychaete, the pileworm (Neanthes succinea). This resident pileworm population has increasingly been subject to periodic crashes driven by exposure to anoxic, sulfide rich, hypolimnetic water following lake mixing events. A set of interlocking mechanisms seem to be operating. These involve, in particular, increasing lake salinity, weather events favoring lake stratification, and booms and busts in tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus x O. urolepis hornorum) and plankton populations, including those of toxic cyanobacteria. In spring, Eared Grebes arrive from the Gulf of California and many arrive in need of food to fuel the remainder of their migration. When pileworms are scarce, many grebes are able to continue on toward their northern breeding grounds, but those that lack sufficient energy stores are forced to stay and may eventually perish. This analysis is surely incomplete, and definitive explanations of the excessive drinking and waterlogged plumage often exhibited by Eared Grebes during mass dieoffs have yet to be found.																			1040-2381						2007	23	5					500	517		10.1080/07438140709354034	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140709354034													WOS:000207177800003
J	Craig, IP				Craig, I. P.			Comparison of precise water depth measurements on agricultural storages with open water evaporation estimates	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												A simple technique to determine evaporation and seepage losses of agricultural water storages is described. Evaporation is calculated from automatic weather station (AWS) variables using the Penman-Monteith equation, and seepage is determined as the difference between this and accurate water depth measurements made using a pressure sensitive transducer (PST). The accuracy of the PST devices (1 mm) was far greater than any flow metering equipment available, so analysis only took place when there was no pumping in and out of the dam. Calibration tests were carried out during the summer of 2004/2005 at a dam site where seepage was very close to zero, as total evaporation plus seepage loss over the winter months there was independently determined to be less than 1 mm/day. Summertime PST depth traces were compared to the Penman 1948 equation, Penman-Monteith (PM) ETo calculated according to the FAO56 method and Penman-Monteith (PM) with surface resistance set to zero to simulate a open water surface. The first two produced the best correlations (within 10% agreement with the water depth trace), but PM open water over predicted by 40%. This technique has provided a useful tool to more accurately apportion total water loss into evaporation and seepage components. Similar to the evapotranspiration of different crop types, it is suggested that that the evaporation of open water can be similarly related to the international standard FAO56 PM via a simple dam factor.

J	Waltham, NJ; Connolly, RM				Waltham, Nathan J.; Connolly, Rod M.			Artificial tidal lakes: Built for humans, home for fish	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The construction of artificial, residential waterways to increase the opportunities for coastal properties with waterfrontage is a common and widespread practice. We describe the fish community from the world's largest aggregation of artificial, estuarine lakes, the Burleigh Lake system that covers 280 ha on the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia. Fish were collected from 30 sites in winter and spring of one year, and water salinity was measured 3-monthly for a 10 year period. Fish are not present in deep, bottom waters and the intensive sampling focussed on the shallow waters around lake margins. The fish fauna consisted of 33 species. All but three species are marine species that can tolerate some brackishness. The other three are freshwater species, normally found in rivers but also occurring in the upper reaches of estuaries. Fish communities differed among the lakes, reflecting a weak gradient in salinity in lakes at different distances from the single connection to the natural estuary and thus marine waters. Overall, the deeper (to 28 m), wider (700 m) characteristics of lake estates, and their incorporation of partial barriers to tidal exchange with natural reaches of estuaries, remove some of the hydrological concerns with very extensive canal estates. The shallow lake margins are habitat for a subset of fish species inhabiting adjacent natural wetlands. Where the lakes occupy space that was formerly land, this is novel habitat for fish. In place, however, where lakes have replaced natural wetlands, further comparisons of fish in lake and adjacent natural wetlands will be useful. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Larue, P; Bélanger, L; Huot, J				Larue, Pierre; Belanger, Louis; Huot, Jean			Amounts of white-tailed deer in winter: selection of site or pure coincidence?	ECOSCIENCE												In north-east North America, it has been often reported that white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmermann) preferentially locate their winter yards along streams and lakes. However, it has never been determined if this pattern of habitat use was related to the distribution of coniferous stands associated with more humid, down slope sites along waterways or if deer preferentially use riparian stands in their winter yard. An experimental design to discriminate the effect of stream or lake proximity from other habitat features, was established in the lac des Baies deer yard, near Rimouski (eastern Quebec). Using pellet-group counts as an index of habitat use, the use of mature coniferous stands (3.75 ha balsam fir-northern white-cedar stands) contiguous to water (n = 8) was compared with similar fir-cedar stands (n = 8) located in the same deer yard but away (> 300 m) from streams or lakes. According to this index, riparian stands were used almost twice as much as the non-riparian stands (P = 0.02). Because of the similarity between the two groups of stands, neither the nature of the cover nor the nature of the shrub layer could explain this difference in use. Also, there was no evidence of a gradient in use according to distance in the first 150 m from the riparian ecotone. However, pellet-groups were particularly concentrated on small hillocks bordering the riparian zone. The exact cause for the greater use of riparian stands has not been established but could be related to an anti-predatory strategy, in this case, to habitats sought for bedding. In the context of the integrated forest management of winter deer yards, riparian stands should be given high priority as prime habitats for deer.																			1195-6860	2376-7626					1994	1	3					223	230		10.1080/11956860.1994.11682246	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11956860.1994.11682246													WOS:000208105300004

Importance and predictability of cannibalism in rainbow smelt	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Cannibalism is a key interaction between young of year (age-0) and older fish in many freshwater ecosystems. Density and spatial overlap between age-groups often drive cannibalism. Because both density and overlap can be quantified, the magnitude of cannibalism may be predictable. Our study considered cannibalism in rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax in Lake Champlain (New York-Vermont, United States, and Quebec, Canada). We used acoustic estimates of the density and distribution of age-0 and yearling-and-older (age-1+) rainbow smelt to predict cannibalism in the diets of age-1+ fish during 2001 and 2002. Experienced density, a measure combining density and spatial overlap, was the strongest predictor (R-2 = 0.89) of the proportion of cannibals in the age-1+ population. Neither spatial niche overlap (R-2 = 0.04) nor age-0 density (R-2 = 0.30) alone was a good predictor of cannibalism. Cannibalism among age-1+ rainbow smelt was highest in June, lowest in July, and high in September owing to differences in thermal stratification and habitat shifts by age-0 fish. Between July and September, age-1+ rainbow smelt consumed 0.1-11% of the age-0 population each day. This resulted in a 38-93% mortality of age-0 fish due to cannibalism. These estimated mortality rates did not differ significantly from observed declines in age-0 rainbow smelt abundances between sampling dates. Age-1+ rainbow smelt are probably the primary predators on age-0 rainbow smelt during the summer and early fall in Lake Champlain.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				JAN	2007	136	1					227	237		10.1577/T05-280.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T05-280.1													WOS:000244312900020

Magadi is a perennial lake but with an extensive trona crust. Thermal springs occur at many points around the lake. The northern Suguta Valley has surface water only intermittently, apart from the very small Lake Logipi. Thermal springs tend to discharge onto sediment fans. Chemical and stable isotopic data from the springs of each basin have revealed some fundamental differences. Chemically these can be summarised as a greater loss of carbonate in the Suguta and a major loss of sulphate at Magadi, while isotopically the waters of the Suguta are more evaporated than those of Magadi. The hydrogeological habitat of the Suguta promotes the recirculation of waters, leading both to the removal of carbonate in surface crusts and to a well-oxygenated system in which sulphate can flourish. The latter does not occur at Magadi, leading to large amounts of sulphate reduction.																					90-2651-824-2				2001							95	98																WOS:000172263500012
J	Li, J; Xia, CL				Li, Jian; Xia, Chunlin			Drivers of Spatial and Temporal Dynamics in Water Turbidity of China Yangtze River Basin	WATER												The sustainable development of the water environment in the Yangtze River basin has become a critical issue in China. Turbidity is a comprehensive element for water quality monitoring. In this study, the baseline of water turbidity in the Yangtze River was constructed using 36 years of Landsat images from 1986 to 2021. The spatial and temporal dynamics of turbidity and its driving factors were explored. The results show that (i) the proposed Landsat-based turbidity model performs well, with a correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.68 and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 7.83 NTU for the whole basin. (ii) The turbidity level in the Yangtze River basin is spatially high in the upper reaches (41.7 NTU), low in the middle reaches (30.9 NTU), and higher in the lower reaches (37.6 NTU). The river turbidity level (60.1 NTU) is higher than the turbidity in lakes and reservoirs (29.6 NTU). The turbidity in the Yangtze River basin shows a decreasing trend from 1986 to 2021, with the most significant decrease in the mainstream of the Yangtze River. Seasonally, the mean turbidity in the Yangtze River basin shows a "low in summer and high in winter" trend, but opposite trends were revealed for the first time in rivers and lakes, such as Dongting Lake, Poyang Lake, and Taihu Lake, etc. (iii) Natural factors, including precipitation and natural vegetation cover (woodlands, grasslands, and shrubs) could explain 58% of the turbidity variations, while human activities including impervious surfaces, cropland, and barren land are lower impact. Annual precipitation was negatively correlated with water turbidity, while cropland and barren land showed a significant positive correlation. The study is of great practical value for the sustainable development of the water environment in the Yangtze River basin and provides a reference for remote sensing monitoring of the water environment in inland water bodies.																				2073-4441				APR	2023	15	7							1264	10.3390/w15071264	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15071264													WOS:000970443400001

In order to fill this gap, the diurnal activities of the species were monitored over a period of four years. In addition, data were collected on its nocturnal behaviour during the wintering season 1999-2000. Location: Lac des Oiseaux, northeast Algeria. Results and Discussion: Results indicated sleeping as the main diurnal activity whereas feeding dominated during the night. Diurnal feeding, peaking at the start of the wintering period, exhibited a marked seasonal decline, mirrored by an increase in sleeping and swimming. Nocturnal feeding and sleeping were inversely correlated and they displayed, respectively, a progressive increase and decrease between October and March. Feeding peaked in the middle of the night when sleeping reached its lowest values. Flight was most prominent around dawn.

Here, we examine changes in sulfur speciation of lamination couplets from Lake Titicaca, South America using X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. The dark-colored layer of each lamination couplet contains a significant fraction of reduced organic sulfides, with smaller fractions of iron sulfides and sulfate. In contrast, the light-colored layer of each couplet is primarily composed of sulfate. In all laminae, the sulfate is present as inorganic sulfate substituted in calcite. The differences in speciation likely reflect changes in productivity during sediment deposition. During the warm, productive summer months, micritic calcite precipitation was induced in oxidized surface waters due to pH changes induced by consumption of dissolved CO2-this calcite incorporates dissolved sulfate and forms the light-colored layers. This pulse of productivity creates organic matter that partially decomposes during the austral winter months, consuming oxygen and delivering organic-rich sediment to the lake bottom. This decomposition, and the possible presence of a halocline, kept bottom waters low in oxygen, and lead to the production of organic matter rich in reduced sulfur. These data suggest that these laminations are deposited annually and illustrate the utility of S K-edge XANES for the analysis of laminated sediments. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Isotopic niches of Silver Carp and two native planktivores in a large reservoir	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Human-mediated biological invasions can greatly reduce native species diversity. More than 138 nonnative fishes have been introduced to the United States. Many of these nonnative species can alter ecosystem dynamics and compete with native species. The planktivorous Silver Carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix Valenciennes in Cuvier and Valenciennes, 1844) is a nonnative species of concern that is currently expanding its range across the Greater Mississippi River Basin in the Midwestern United States. The objective of our study was to determine the degree of potential competition among invasive Silver Carp and the native planktivores, Gizzard Shad (Dorosoma cepedianum Lesueur, 1818) and Threadfin Shad (Dorosoma petenense Gunther, 1867), in Kentucky Lake, a large reservoir located in western Kentucky and Tennessee. We used data derived from N and C isotopes to model isotopic niches, calculate quantitative metrics to describe variability within and among isotopic niches and trophic positions, and qualitatively assess seasonal shifts in trophic positions. Our results suggest that in the spring, older (>= 1 y old) Silver Carp share resources with older and young-of-year (YOY; <1 y old) Gizzard Shad, whereas YOY Silver Carp only share resources with YOY Gizzard Shad. Additionally, our analyses showed that older Silver Carp and older Gizzard Shad share resources in the summer. In contrast, we found no overlap in resource use between YOY Threadfin Shad and YOY or older Silver Carp. Furthermore, we provide evidence of intraspecific ontogenetic shifts in isotopic niche area and overlap between invasive and native fishes (measured by sample-size corrected standard ellipse area). If resources become limiting, invasive Silver Carp may compete with multiple life stages of Gizzard Shad in Kentucky Lake and alter foodweb dynamics.

High resolution environmental conditions of the last interglacial (MIS5e) in the Levant from Sr, C and O isotopes from a Jerusalem stalagmite	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The southern Levant region at the fringe of the Saharan-Arabian deserts is particularly vulnerable to warming and desertification, therefore reconstruction of the hydroclimate conditions of this region during periods of past climate change provide important insight on what may occur in the future. Here we report on high temporal resolution Sr-87/Sr-86, delta C-13 and delta O-18 isotope data of a stalagmite from the Har Nof cave in Jerusalem, demonstrating major climate changes during the last interglacial MIS5e between similar to 131-116 ka. We combine also data from other caves in Israel and the ICDP Dead Sea deep drill core. The following palaeoenvironmental history is observed: At 131-127.5 ka, Jerusalem experienced moderate Mediterranean climate conditions. Desert dust accumulated above the cave, while salt deposition occurred in the Dead Sea. At 127.5-122 ka, across the MIS5e insolation peak and Sapropel S5 interval in the Mediterranean, highly negative speleothem delta O-18 indicate both Mediterranean and southern (tropical) derived rains. Surface cover diminished, and by 122 ka the Sr-87/Sr-86 and delta C-13 values indicate complete soil removal above the cave. Very high temperatures and intensive fires caused the removal of C-3 vegetation. The rainfall season shifted from winter to summer with tropical-sourced precipitation. At 122-120.5 ka, the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios indicate contributions of sea salts. Extremely high speleothem delta C-13 values indicate no vegetation. At similar to 120.5-118 ka there was higher rainfall and lower temperatures, associated with reestablishment of vegetation, including savannah-like C-4 pioneer grasses that appeared on soil patches. At 118-116 ka, the sedimentation rate of Har Nof AF12 stalagmite is extremely low, indicating regional aridity, coinciding with massive salt deposition in the Dead Sea.					; Frumkin, Amos/AGN-6695-2022	Goldstein, Steven L/0000-0001-7252-8064; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				JAN 15	2022	586								110761	10.1016/j.palaeo.2021.110761	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2021.110761													WOS:000813033900003

Evidence is presented that this nitrogen is cycled within the mountainous aquifers eventually outflowing to the Jordan River and later to Lake Kinneret as nitrate. Within the watershed, there are additional sources of nitrogen that add almost half of the total annual riverine load. These include "old" N previously buried in peat within the historic Hula Lake and marshes as well as N in fertilizers and N resulting from cattle excretion. The drying out of the Hula Valley water bodies some 60 years ago resulted in the oxic degradation of this peat and the conversion of organic N to NH4+ which is later nitrified and the NO3 product is transported in the watershed waterways. At some stage, particularly during the 1970s, peat dust was spread over all of the drainage basin, including Lake Kinneret, through aeolian transport. This is indicated by high levels of organic C and N in the northern tributaries and in the Jordan River itself as well as in Lake Kinneret. As a result of the additional respiratory processes induced by the large amounts of this allochthanous organic matter, those waterways and Lake Kinneret surface water showed lower pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) levels than in the following decades. The two main external sources of phosphorus to Lake Kinneret are riverine and dust. In accordance with water discharge, the riverine source predominates in winter, while the dust source is more important in the dry season that follows. Isotopic (oxygen) evidence suggests that most of the P in dust originates from P fertilization of cultivated soils. Notice that in this relatively dry climate, aeolian transport of nutrients plays an important role, particularly in summer.																			1573-4595	2543-005X	978-94-017-8944-8; 978-94-017-8943-1				2014	6						329	346		10.1007/978-94-017-8944-8_19	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-8944-8_19	10.1007/978-94-017-8944-8												WOS:000459771400020

The connectivity of the channel connecting Poyang Lake and the Yangtze River not only ensures the regular migration of fish but also makes Poyang Lake a feeding and fattening ground for them. Unfortunately, human activities have dramatically changed the hydrodynamic conditions of Poyang Lake, which is experiencing severe drought due to the obvious decline in the water level in autumn and winter, especially since 2003. However, the possible impacts of the changes in the water level on the habitats of migratory fish remain unclear due to the limitation of traditional techniques in spatiotemporal analysis. Here, we combined a hydrodynamic model and habitat suitability model to simulate variations in the suitable habitat area and their connectivity under different water-level conditions. The conditions for the migration pathway of the target fish were obtained by a hydroacoustic survey using the Simrad EY60 echosounder. The results showed that the change in water level will significantly affect the spatiotemporal change in the suitable habitats and their connectivity. In particular, we found the existence of two thresholds that play a dominant role in illuminating the connectivity of effective suitable habitats (HC). Firstly, the maximum value of the weighted usable area (WUA) and HC can be achieved when the water level is more than 16 m. Secondly, when the water level is between 10 and 16 m, the changes in the HC are sensitive and rapid, and the area flooded at this stage is called the sensitive area. HC is a crucial element in fish migration and habitat conditions. Under the condition of continuous drought in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, our research contributes to clarifying the influence of water level on key habitats for fish and optimizes the practice of river-lake ecological management.						, LI/0000-0001-7396-8432														2073-4441				JUL	2022	14	13							2076	10.3390/w14132076	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14132076													WOS:000825651600001

We utilized the unique setting of Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee, northern Israel) in which most of the Ra and Th nuclides are introduced into the lake by saline springs with high Ra-226 activities and a high Ra-224/Ra-228 ratio of 1.5. The mixing of the Ra enriched saline waters and freshwater in the lake causes the Ra-224/Ra-228 ratio to drop down to 0.1 in the Kinneret due to preferential adsorption of Th-228. These conditions constitute a "natural experiment" for estimating adsorption rates. We developed a simple mass-balance model for the radionuclides in Lake Kinneret that accurately predicted the Ra isotope ratios and the Ra-226 activity in the lake. The model is comprised of simultaneous equations; one for each radionuclide. The equations have one input term: supply of radionuclides from the saline springs; and three output terms: adsorption on particles in the lake, radioactive decay and outflow from the lake. The redundancy in the analytical solutions to the mass balance equations for the relevant nuclides constrained the values of Ra and Th adsorption rate constants to a very narrow range. Our results indicate that the adsorption rate constant for Ra is between 0.005 d(-1) and 0.02 d(-1). The rate constant for Th is between 0.5 d(-1) and 1 d(-1), about fifty to a hundred times higher. The estimated desorption rate coefficient for Ra is about 50-100 times larger than its adsorption rate constant. The mass-balance equations show that the residence times of all Ra isotopes (Ra-226, Ra-228, Ra-223, Ra-224) and of Th-228 in the lake are about 95, 92, 14, 6 and 1 d, respectively. These residence times are much shorter than the residence time of water in the lake (about 5.5 y). The steady state activity ratios in Lake Kinneret depend mainly on the adsorption rate constants, decay constants, the outflow rate from the lake and the activity ratios in the saline springs. The activity ratios are independent of the saline springs flow rate. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We hypothesize that these heatwaves contributed to HABs formation and expansion. Leveraging Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data, we employed clustering and machine learning methods to quantify the HABs distribution and area. Concurrent meteorological and water quality data aided in uncovering the effects of heatwave on HABs. When applying different methods to extract HABs from remote sensing images, random forest (RF) analyses indicated accuracies of 99.3% and 99.8% for Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data, respectively, while classification and regression tree (CART) analyses indicated 99.1% and 99.7% accuracies, respectively. Support vector machine (SVM) exhibited lower accuracies (83.5% and 97.4%). Thus RF, given its smaller differences between satellites and high accuracy, was selected for further analysis. Both satellites detected extensive HABs in 2022, with Sentinel-2 recording a peak area of 24.13 km 2 (44.6% of cloud-free water area) on August 11, 2022. Increasing trends with amplified durations were observed for summer heatwaves in Jiande and Tonglu around the Fuchunjiang Reservoir. Notably, these areas experienced extreme heatwaves for 63 and 58 days in 2022, respectively, more than double the 1980 -2022 average. From June 1 to October 8, 2022, water temperature peaks significantly coincided with expansive HABs and elevated chlorophyll a (Chl- a ) concentration from 4.8 mu g/L to 119.2 mu g/L during the summer heatwaves. Our findings indicated that the reservoir became more HAB-prone during heatwave events, escalating the drinking water safety risk. These results emphasize the challenges faced by reservoir managers in dealing with climate-induced extreme heatwaves and underscore the urgency for heightened attention from water source management departments.

A progressively wetter early through middle Holocene climate in the eastern lowlands of Guatemala	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Climate records from Central America and the Caribbean region reveal considerable spatiotemporal complexity in precipitation variability, with multiple hypotheses explaining the likely ocean-atmosphere processes influencing precipitation in the region. Here we report on findings from a 760-cm long sediment core from Lake Izabal, eastern Guatemala that affords insight on regional hydroclimate change over the last similar to 9,500 years. We utilized a radiocarbon-based age-depth model integrated with lithological, XRF elemental abundances, and principal component analyses to infer changes in erosion/precipitation, lake productivity, and lake water chemistry. Abundance of elements commonly associated with terrigenous sources increase from the early to the latest mid-Holocene, from ca. 9,500 to ca. 4,800 calibrated years before present (cal yr BP), suggesting a progressive increase in erosion/precipitation. This is followed by relatively stable and high erosion/precipitation conditions until ca. 1,200 cal yr BP, with an abrupt decrease in erosion/precipitation similar to 1,200 years ago. Comparison of the Izabal record with other paleoclimate records from Central America and the Caribbean region indicates substantial heterogeneity in hydroclimate, even across relatively short distances, likely due to a combination of topographic complexity and the combined influences of Atlantic and Pacific basin ocean-atmosphere dynamics. Our results suggest that the progressive increase in boreal autumn insolation throughout the middle and late Holocene may have driven an increase in Caribbean sea-surface temperatures (SST) during the late wet season, leading to increased moisture availability through enhanced evaporation and greater precipitation amounts associated with zonal convergence and orographic uplift along the eastern coast of Central America. However, other nearby records demonstrate hydroclimate changes that are at least partially at odds with the Izabal record, indicating that the modern SST relationships with atmospheric circulation, including Intertropical Convergence Zone dynamics, and precipitation alone cannot be used as a framework for explaining hydroclimate variability across Central America during the Holocene.

Given the strong role that wood plays in streams, factors that influence wood inputs, retention and transport are critical to stream ecology. Wood entrapment, the process of wood coming to rest after being swept downstream at least 10 m, is poorly understood, yet important for predicting stream function and success of restoration efforts. Data on entrapment were collected for a wide range of natural wood pieces (n = 344), stream geomorphology and hydraulic conditions in nine streams along the north shore of Lake Superior in Minnesota. Locations of pieces were determined in summer 2007 and again following an overbank stormflow event in fall 2007. The ratio of piece length to effective stream width (length ratio) and the weight of the piece were important in a multiple logistic regression model that explained 25% of the variance in wood entrapment. Entrapment remains difficult to predict in natural streams, and often may simply occur wherever wood pieces are located when high water recedes. However, this study can inform stream modifications to discourage entrapment at road crossings or other infrastructure by applying the model formula to estimate the effective width required to pass particular wood pieces. Conversely, these results could also be used to determine conditions (e. g. pre-existing large, stable pieces) that encourage entrapment where wood is valued for ecological functions.

B	Gandouin, E; Ponel, P		Dodson, J		Gandouin, Emmanuel; Ponel, Philippe			Rivers	CHANGING CLIMATES, EARTH SYSTEMS AND SOCIETY	International Year of Planet Earth											Quaternary insect subfossils preserved in river deposits allow for the reconstruction of past environmental and climate changes. During the last glacial period, warm climate periods such as Dansgaard/Oeschger events or the Late-Glacial Interstadial have been recorded by the reappearance of temperate faunas, typical of very shallow lakes or low-energy anastomosing rivers. Inference models indicate temperatures reaching values similar to those of the present day. During cold periods such as the Younger Dryas, insect faunas were characterized by the presence of numerous cold-adapted species. Summer air temperatures ranged between 9 and 11 degrees C. Winter temperatures were close to -11 to -12 degrees C. During the early Holocene, temperatures rapidly increased to reach a thermal optimum (about 18-20 degrees C) at around 8,000 year C-14 BP. From the Middle Holocene, climate reconstructions are biased by increasing local impact of human activities on river water bodies. In France, cultivation and pastoralism led to the clearance of alluvial forest around 5,000-4,000 BP. This induced the disappearance of riffle beetles due to the rise in load in fines in the stream resulting from soil erosion. The fossil fauna from 2,000 BP to the present is mainly made of ruderal grassland associated taxa, dung-beetles and synanthropic taxa associated with food stored products.

The work detailed in this paper involved a preliminary analysis pertaining to the possibility of using an isotopic index in association with the values for trophic and saprobic indicators in describing a dam reservoir experiencing a far-reaching eutrophication. The water samples for the physicochemical analysis were collected from three sites along the axis of the dam reservoir in Rz-eszow three times during the spring and summer of 2013. The results sustained the classification of the Reservoir's waters as hypertrophic, irrespective of the particular zone sampled. While phytoplankton blooms characterised by reference to the numbers of organisms per unit volume of water were also similar throughout the Reservoir, diversification in terms of taxonomic composition was to be noted, given the occurrence of cyanobacteria among the dominant diatoms in the area close to the dam. This presence was accompanied by enrichment of the Reservoir's suspended organic matter with carbon of the heavier C-13 isotope. On this basis, the delta C-13 isotopic index can be regarded as a potentially useful indicator allowing for more accurate identification of both the level and the nature of the ongoing trophic degradation in bodies of water.

These waterbodies are typical plateau wetlands with dense vegetation and vary in permanence and area (from 3.3 ha to 29.35 ha). Oxygen concentration, conductivity and pH were recorded at the time of sampling. Lake area, depth, water permanence and type of vegetation were also taken into account. Ninety two species were collected. Species richness was high in comparison with other wetlands in Spain. The assemblage structure was assessed in terms of three community parameters: richness, abundance and diversity (Shannon index). Their relationships with environmental variables were explored using correlation coefficients. The assemblage composition was analysed by multivariate techniques. First, the sites were classified by means of TWINSPAN. The presence of each species in the different TWINSPAN groups was used to assess their habitat preferences. Second, the sites and species were ordinated by Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) using the CANOCO statistical package. Richness was significantly correlated with water permanence, conductivity and aquatic macrophyte cover. The first DCA axis was significantly correlated with water permanence and conductivity, but not with any of the other parameters. Conductivity was significantly inter-correlated with permanence. Therefore, water permanence and aquatic vegetation cover seem to be the main factors influencing richness, but only water permanence appears to determine species composition.

A total of 29 ostracod species were recorded in 57 sites. Among the species, Trajancypris Iaevis (G.W. Muller 1900), is a new report for the Turkish ostracod fauna. First axis of Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) explained about 68% of the relationships between the 13 most abundant species and environmental variables. Four variables (redox potential, habitat type, pH and electrical conductivity) had the greatest effect on species composition (P < 0.01). Twenty-six species encountered from 38 stations were restricted between 1659 and 1750 m a.s.l. Above 1750 m a.s.l., the numbers of species were not significantly affected by altitude (P > 0.05). Three species (Heterocypris incongruens (Ramdohr, 1808), Hyocypris bradyi Sars, 1890 and Potamocypris villosa (Jurine, 1820)) occurred extensively from 1650 to 2350 m a.s.l. Spearman rank correlation revealed a negative relationship between Limnocythere inopinata (Baird, 1843) and altitude (r = -0.894, P = 0.05). while two species (I. MOO and Prionocypris zenkeri (Chyzer and Toth, 1858)) had a positive correlation to dissolved oxygen (P = 0.05). There was a significantly negative relationship between Hyocypris inermis Kaufmann, 1900 and electrical conductivity, and H. Mcongruens showed a significant correlation to station type. Five groups of species were determined by UPGMA analysis. Species in each cluster were grouped according to ecological conditions suitable for them. Results revealed that species ecological tolerances and optimum levels can be species-specific but species with cosmopolitan distributions tend to have high tolerance ranges to different variables, including altitudinal changes.					; KÜLKÖYLÜOĞLU, OKAN/A-6441-2018; Akdemir, Derya/B-2635-2019	Akdemir, Derya/0000-0003-1253-3376; 													0003-4088	2100-000X					2012	48	1					39	51		10.1051/limn/2011060	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2011060													WOS:000304431400006
J	STAUFFER, RE				STAUFFER, RE			ENVIRONMENTAL TRACER ANALYSIS OF WINTER PROFILE DEVELOPMENT IN 2 BASINS OF SHAGAWA LAKE, MINNESOTA	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Winter profile development was studied comparatively in two basins (z(max) = 14 m) separated by a 6 m sill in Shagawa Lake, Minnesota. Based on physical arguments and profile measurements, heat and solutes released from shelf sediments in the western basin cause convective instability at 8-11 m. After a mid-winter interval of instability, radon profiles indicate very low rates of vertical mixing in the benthic boundary layers following their stabilization by ferrous iron. Because of hydrographic features, two types of plunging inflows sometimes enter the western basin in late winter; one anthropogenic inflow alters the lower profiles by adding sodium, radon, and oxygen; the second modifies the mid-depth region by adding 'weathering tracers' (especially calcium and silicon) derived from the Ely greenstone. The oxidation of Fe2+ diffusing upward and laterally from the sediment-water interface is accompanied by near-complete coprecipitation of phosphorus. The oxidation of Fe2+ has only a minor effect on silicic acid, probably because of unfavorably large Si:P and preferential association of Fe(III) with phosphorus. Despite low pH and temperature, detectable amounts of Mn2+ oxidize and precipitate above iron in the water column. Solute profiles differentially register the complex effects of hydrodynamic vs. geochemical processes, and as a consequence, affect the estimation of solute budgets in ice-covered lakes.																			0022-1694					JUL	1992	135	1-4					175	200		10.1016/0022-1694(92)90088-D	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(92)90088-D													WOS:A1992JF93100011

Precipitation in the northern and the southern parts of the eastern monsoon region of China exhibits a centennial scale inverse relationship over the past 2000 years; however, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the temporal range of this dipolar pattern. In order to better understand this north-south pattern of precipitation variation and its driving mechanism, we analyzed isoGDGTs biomarker compounds in a sediment core from alpine Daye Lake, in the Qinling Mountains, in the north-south climatic transition zone of eastern China. Measurements of %Cren were used to reconstruct changes in lake level over the past 2000 years. The results show that, from 240 to 1300 CE, prior to the Little Ice Age, the lake level changes were consistent with the precipitation record for the northern part of eastern China, with the lake reaching its highest level of 25 +/- 7.17 mat 555 CE; subsequently, the lake fell to its lowest level of 12 +/- 7.17 m at 1030 CE. During the Little Ice Age, the water level maintained an increasing trend, especially during the last three centuries, when it remained above 20 +/- 7.17 m, which is consistent with the precipitation record from southern China. The results indicate that the climatically transitional Qinling region has a complex history of climate change. During the early part of the record (240-130 0 CE), the level of Daye Lake and the East Asian summer monsoon precipitation were in phase, controlled mainly by the strength of the East Asian summer monsoon. In contrast, since the Little Ice Age (1300 CE to the present), under the influence of ENSO, the westward extension and southward retreat of the West Pacific Subtropical High caused the rain belt to shift southward, decreasing the water vapor supply to the Qinling Mountains. The ascent of moisture-bearing air over the Qinling Mountains resulted in orographic rainfall, while the weakening of evaporation during the Little Ice Age reduced the evaporation of water vapor and also contributed to the continued rise of the level of Daye Lake. The abundant precipitation in the Qinling region during the Little Ice Age provided water resources to sustain human activities in the downstream Weihe Plain, but was also a major cause of flooding.

Phytoplankton abundance is a key indicator of the trophic and water quality status of lakes. Phytoplankton dynamics are characterized by high spatio-temporal variation, driven by physical, chemical and biological factors, that challenge the capacity of routine monitoring with conventional sampling techniques (i.e., boat-based sampling) to characterise these complex relationships. In this study, high frequency in situ measurements and multispectral satellite data were used in a synergistic way to explore temporal (diurnal and seasonal) dynamics and spatial distribution of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, a proxy of phytoplankton abundance, together with physico-chemical water parameters in a shallow fluvial-lake system (Mantua Lakes). A good agreement was found between Chl-a retrieved by remote sensing data and Chl-a fluorescence data recorded by multi-parameters probes (R-2 = 0.94). The Chl-a maps allowed a seasonal classification of the Mantua lakes system as eutrophic or hypertrophic. Along the Mantua lakes system an increasing gradient in Chl-a concentration was recorded following the transition from a fluvial to lacustrine system. There was significant seasonal heterogeneity among the subbasins, probably due to different hydrodynamics, influenced also by macrophyte stands. High-frequency data revealed the importance of rainfall events in the timing and growth dynamics of phytoplankton, particularly for spring and late summer blooms. Combining temporal and spatial data at high resolution improves the understanding of complex fluvial-lake systems. This technique can allow managers to target blooms in near-real time as they move through a system and guide them to localized hot spots enabling timely management action in ecosystems of high conservation and recreational value.

Cyanobacterial blooms in Ontario, Canada: Continued increase in reports through the 21st century	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Favot EJ, Holeton C, DeSellas AM, Paterson AM. 2023. Cyanobacterial blooms in Ontario, Canada: Continued increase in reports through the 21st century. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XXXXXX.The Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks samples algal composition in response to public reports of suspected algal blooms, which have been tracked since 1994. In a previous analysis, Winter et al. noted a significant increase in the number of reports of confirmed algal blooms dominated by cyanobacteria from 1994 to 2009. Here, we determined that this increasing trend in the yearly number of confirmed cyanobacterial bloom reports (CCBRs) has persisted in Ontario over the intervening decade, to 2019. More than half of CCBRs were from waterbodies on the Precambrian Shield, in the Georgian Bay (5E) ecoregion, known for cottaging and water-based tourism. Data from the Ontario Lake Partner Program (LPP) was used to investigate total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in waterbodies with CCBRs. Approximately 44% of the waterbodies with a CCBR (mean TP 12.99 mu g/L, n = 135) had average spring TP concentrations less than 10 mu g/L, compared to 64% for LPP waterbodies with no reported or confirmed cyanobacterial blooms (mean TP 9.79 mu g/L, n = 918). The most common taxon of cyanobacteria dominating bloom samples in inland waterbodies was Dolichospermum, followed by Aphanizomenon in waterbodies on the Precambrian Shield, and Microcystis in the Mixedwood Plains ecozone in southern Ontario. While an increase in public awareness cannot be ruled out in contributing to the rise in CCBRs across Ontario, the high proportion of cyanobacterial blooms occurring in oligotrophic waterbodies suggests that there may be a link to climate warming, rendering conditions more favorable for these blooms to occur.					; Holeton, Claire/GWU-9618-2022	Holeton, Claire/0000-0002-5806-1370; Paterson, Andrew/0000-0002-4296-9528; Favot, Elizabeth/0000-0002-3860-8658													1040-2381	2151-5530				JAN 2	2023	39	1					1	20		10.1080/10402381.2022.2157781	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2022.2157781		DEC 2022											WOS:000924010300001

During the past few decades, a series of Holocene palaeoclimatic records have been obtained from sediment cores from Lake Qinghai and from various other geological archives in the surrounding area of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. However, because of uncertainties regarding the sediment chronologies and the climatic significance of the proxies used, the nature of Holocene climatic changes in the region remains unclear and even controversial. Here we review all major classes of the published data from drilled cores from Lake Qinghai, as well as other evidence from lakes and aeolian deposits from surrounding areas, in order to reconstruct changes in moisture patterns and possible summer monsoon evolution in the area during the Holocene. Combining the results of moisture and precipitation proxies such as vegetation history, pollen-based precipitation reconstruction, aeolian activity, lake water depth/lake level changes, salinity and sediment redness, we conclude that moisture and precipitation began to increase in the early Holocene, reached their maximum during the middle Holocene, and decreased during the late Holocene- similar to the pattern of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) in northern China. It is clear that the region experienced a relatively dry climate and weak EASM during the early Holocene, as indicated by relatively low tree pollen percentages and fluctuating pollen concentrations; generally low lake levels of Lake Qinghai and the adjacent Lake Hurleg and Lake Toson in the Qaidam Basin; and widely distributed aeolian sand deposition in the Lake Qinghai Basin and the nearby Gonghe Basin to the south, and in the eastern Qaidam Basin to the west. We argue that the ostracod delta O-18 record, which is widely used as a proxy of effective moisture and summer monsoon intensity in lake sediments, at least in Lake Qinghai, and which exhibits light values in the early Holocene and heavier values thereafter, cannot be used to reflect the strength of the EASM or the intensity of monsoon precipitation- as is also the case for leaf wax delta H-2 records. Rather, we argue that as is the case of the Chinese speleothem delta O-18 record, which also is often interpreted as an EASM proxy, it reflects variation in the delta O-18 of precipitation. Overall, we suggest that the EASM significantly affected precipitation in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau during the Holocene; and that it increased in strength during the early Holocene, reached a maximum during the middle Holocene and decreased during the late Holocene.

Measurements of selected environmental parameters at sampling sites within four ecologically distinct regions of the lake were combined with direct experimental determinations of limiting levels of light and nutrients for phytoplankton growth to determine spatial and temporal variations in the relative roles of these limiting factors. Estimated mean light availability in the mixed layer, I-m, was significantly lower in the turbid central region of the lake than in other regions. Correlations between I-m and phytoplankton standing crops led to the conclusion that low light availability in the central region of the lake, and to a lesser extent in other areas, restricts phytoplankton standing crops to levels below the potential provided by the nutrients available. The results of the irradiance-growth experiments confirmed the conclusions of the correlation analyses that phytoplankton growth is restricted by the levels of Light availability experienced during the winter and spring in the central region of the lake. Bioassays indicated that nitrogen was the most frequently limiting nutrient for phytoplankton growth. High rates of nitrogen fixation were frequently observed in the lake, along with correspondingly high abundances of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria and nitrogen fixation activity. Elevated concentrations of soluble inorganic nitrogen appeared to suppress both nitrogen fixation and the relative abundance of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria.																			0142-7873					MAR	1997	19	3					319	342																WOS:A1997WR26000003
J	Mulderij, G; Van Nes, EH; Van Donk, E				Mulderij, Gabi; Van Nes, Egbert H.; Van Donk, Ellen			Macrophyte-phytoplankton interactions: The relative importance of allelopathy versus other factors	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Submerged aquatic macrophytes are important in shallow aquatic ecosystems because they stabilize the macrophyte- dominated state by increasing water transparency in various ways. one of these is the excretion of allelopathic substances inhibitory to phytoplankton, but it is still controversial whether this mechanism can be important in the field. We developed a model that describes phytoplankton growth including the effects of two different macrophytes (Chara sp. and Stratiotes aloides), which are both known to excrete allelopathic substances. With this model we analysed singular and combined effects of shading (1), sediment resuspension (2), competition for nutrients (3) and allelopathy (4) on the development of phytoplankton. Both macrophyte species had a considerable effect on phosphorus levels in the water. Shading of phytoplankton by Chara sp. was estimated to be negligible. This macrophyte species has a growth form close to the sediment. The allelopathic activity of Chara sp. caused a phytoplankton growth reduction of ca. 5-10%, while the most pronounced effect seems to be related to reduction of resuspension. S. aloides floats on the water surface during spring and summer. Therefore, it has a potentially high shading effect. Additionally, this species has a relatively strong allelopathic capacity, sometimes resulting in a reduction of phytoplankton between 50 and 80%. The model suggests that the relative contribution of allelopathy in situ is low or negligible for charophytes. Only for macrophyte species that have a high allelopathic potential, like S. aloides, it may be a significant effect.

A Holocene history of the Indian monsoon from Qilu Lake, southwestern China	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Understanding the magnitude, nature, and forcing mechanisms of past abrupt changes in Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) strength is central to characterizing future manifestations in the face of global climate change, particularly at centennial time scales. Here we summarize a 6200 year record of oxygen isotopes from Lake Qilu in Yunnan Province, China. The lake is sensitive to changes in precipitation-evaporation balance and precipitates calcite, potentially providing insight into past hydroclimate through oxygen isotope analysis. Beginning at 5200 cal years BP, oxygen isotopes shift to higher values, indicative of a period of aridity and lower lake levels which persist until 3600 cal years BP. Thereafter, lake levels are extraordinarily stable until 1500 cal years BP. At 1500 cal years BP, measurable anthropogenic impacts occur, resulting in the delivery of red, iron-rich catchment soil to the lake and higher oxygen isotope values. These changes are likely the result of land clearance for the expansion of agricultural activities. The Ojlu record is remarkably consistent with the record from Xingyun Lake, 10 km to the north, strongly suggesting that regional climate drivers are responsible for the changes after 5200 cal years BP and then the stability from 3600 to 1500 cal years BP. Comparison of both these records with Dongge Cave illustrate the importance of evaporative enrichment in driving higher oxygen isotope values from 5200 to 3600 cal years BP. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Lake hydrodynamics intensify the potential impact of watershed pollutants on coastal ecosystem services	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Watersheds deliver numerous pollutants to the coastline of oceans and lakes, thereby jeopardizing ecosystem services. Regulatory frameworks for stressors often focus on loading rates without accounting for the physical dynamics of the receiving water body. Here, we use a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model to simulate the transport of a generic tributary-delivered anthropogenic pollutant within Lake Michigan based on the location and timing of loading. Simulating pollutant plumes from 11 rivers, and their intersections with coastal ecosystem services, reveals strong mediation of potential impacts by lake physics. Trapped pollutants accumulate in nearshore waters during spring peak flows, and become diluted by spreading offshore during the summer. The threat to coastal ecosystem services posed by pollutant loading differs sharply among rivers; high potential impact arises from the spatiotemporal coincidence of tributary input rates, lake mixing dynamics, and multiple human uses of the shoreline. Simultaneous pollution from multiple rivers yields overlapping plumes, creating a second way in which lake hydrodynamics can amplify potential impacts on coastal ecosystem services. Our simulations demonstrate that the physical dynamics of large water bodies can create a dynamic stressor landscape arising from multiple independent sources of non-point-source pollution. The design and implementation of pollution regulations rarely account for spatial and temporal complexities of load processing in receiving waters, yet the resulting variability is likely to strongly mediate impacts on society. As hydrodynamic models improve, our analytical framework could be applied to a wide range of pollutants and waterbodies to enhance the sustainable use of coastal ecosystems.					; McKinley, Galen/IWU-5623-2023	McKinley, Galen/0000-0002-4072-9221; Gloege, Lucas/0000-0001-9062-6960; McIntyre, Peter/0000-0003-1809-7552													1748-9326					JUN	2020	15	6							064028	10.1088/1748-9326/ab7f62	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab7f62													WOS:000539742000001
J	Kleinhenz, A; Koenig, A				Kleinhenz, Anke; Koenig, Andreas			Home ranges and movements of resident graylag geese (Anser anser) in breeding and winter habitats in Bavaria, South Germany	PLOS ONE												In several countries in northwestern Europe, the number of resident greylag geese (Anser anser) has increased by up to 20% a year over the last few decades. The increasing numbers of geese are causing problems in tourism and agriculture. The number of resident greylag geese visiting the Altmuehlsee lake, a recreational area in the south of Germany, has also increased, especially in June and July. However, the geese leave the lake again at the beginning of August. 30 adult greylag geese were banded with telemetry transmitters during molting at the Altmuehlsee lake to determine when the geese leave the lake in August and what structures they need in their winter habitat. The distances the greylag geese flew from their resting sites to foraging sites were calculated, as well as the size of their home ranges and the proportions of each habitat type in the home range. It was found that the greylag geese used small home ranges while rearing their young, and fed close to the water. After molting, the size of their home ranges increased. They fed on fields and meadows around the lake. In the winter habitat, the geese also had a small home range, and they preferred eating grain and corn and the availability of an open body of water. In addition, one group of geese remained in the city of Munich during the winter, benefiting from supplementary food from people. This information helps us to understand the different requirements of resident greylag geese. It can be used to inform management decisions aimed at preventing agricultural damage. Special goose areas can for example be designated for the different periods in a goose's life cycle.

Quantifying vigilance patterns, investigating the trade-off among various activities, and examining the underlying mechanisms will help us understand how waterbirds adapt to human-caused disturbances. During two successive winters (November-February of 2012-13 and 2013-14), we studied the hooded crane, Grus monacha, in the Shengjin Lake National Nature Reserve (NNR), China, to investigate how the species responds to human disturbances through vigilance and activity time-budget adjustments. Our results showed striking differences in the behavior of the cranes when foraging in the highly disturbed rice paddy fields found in the buffer zone compared with the degraded natural wetlands in the core area of the NNR. Time spent vigilant decreased with flock size and cranes spent more time vigilant in the human-dominated buffer zone. In the rice paddy fields, the birds were more vigilant but also fed more at the expense of locomotion and maintenance activities. Adult cranes spent more time vigilant and foraged less than juveniles. We recommend habitat recovery in natural wetlands and community co-management in the surrounding human-dominated landscape for conservation of the hooded crane and, generally, for the vast numbers of migratory waterbirds wintering in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River floodplain.					li, chunlin/KFS-0761-2024; Beauchamp, Guy/KCX-9101-2024; Zhou, Lizhi/AAF-4535-2021	zhouZhou, li zhiLizhi/0000-0002-5702-4658													1932-6203					MAR 13	2015	10	3							e0118928	10.1371/journal.pone.0118928	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0118928								25768111					WOS:000351277500054
J	Sönmez, I; Çelik, M				Sonmez, Ilhan; Celik, Mehmet			Recent bloedite from Ishakli Lake, Cankiri-Corum Basin, Turkey: a mineralogical and hydrogeochemical investigation	CARBONATES AND EVAPORITES												Bloedite (Na2Mg(SO4)(2)center dot 4H(2)O), which is a sodium-magnesium sulfate mineral, has been determined for the first time in Turkey, in the A degrees shaklA +/- Lake within the CankA +/- rA +/--Corum Basin. The A degrees shaklA +/- Lake is a seasonal playa lake which is an east-west extending lake with an area of 0.22 km(2). Geochemical analyses (XRD, XRF, SEM) of the mineral crust samples indicate that they are composed chiefly of bloedite and thenardite (Na2SO4) minerals and lesser amounts of halite (NaCl) and gypsum (CaSO4 center dot 2H(2)O). In the blodite-thenardite association, thenardite mineral grows on bloedite crystals and it is crystallized after bloedite. The well and the spring (and fountain) waters in the vicinity of the lake are saturated with respect to calcite, dolomite, aragonite and talc minerals. In the waters of the A degrees shaklA +/- Lake, however, the degree of saturation of these minerals gradually increases and they become saturated with respect to anhydrite and gypsum as well. Lake waters represent a hydrochemical facies of Na-Mg-SO4-Cl (type I). Tritium data (H-3) indicate that lake waters have higher tritium content (7.55 TU) than the springs and fountains (5.45-6.15 TU), and although there is a thick rock-salt drilled at the bottom of lake (to a depth of 220 m), no recent halite precipitation is observed in the lake bottom. This is attributed to recent recharge and the absence of deep groundwater circulation. The delta O-18-delta H-2 data show that spring and fountain waters are in shallow circulation and have undergone a slight evaporation while waters of A degrees shaklA +/- Lake experienced an intense evaporation. According to Mineral Formation Model proposed herein, a portion of the rainfall reaches directly the lake. Additionally, there is recharge from springs, which travel through the BozkA +/- r Formation and reach the lake. During hot periods, evaporation process begins with carbonate and gypsum precipitation as a white-colored crust on the mud flat along the shore of the lake. Therefore, calcium deficit occurs in the lake water. Further evaporation and possible cation exchange process in clay and muds at the lake bottom might be responsible for the formation of Na-sulfate (bloedite + thenardite) mineralization.																			0891-2556	1878-5212				SEP	2017	32	3					295	313		10.1007/s13146-016-0290-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13146-016-0290-9													WOS:000408344200003
J	Antunes, SC; Pereira, R; Gonçalves, F				Antunes, Sara C.; Pereira, Ruth; Goncalves, Fernando			Evaluation of the potential toxicity (acute and chronic) of sediments from abandoned uranium mine ponds	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS												Background, Aim and Scope. The superficial aquatic system of the Cunha Baixa uranium mine area is comprised by the flooded mine pit (M), which receives the acidic mine effluent resultant from in situ leaching of pore ore, a pond where this effluent is neutralised (T), and a potential reference pond (Ref). As part of the first tiers of an ecological risk assessment that is being performed in this area, the aim of this work was to evaluate the potential sediment toxicity of these ponds. Methodology. To perform this work, elutriates were produced from sediments collected at the three ponds in two distinct seasons (Spring and Winter). Acute and chronic toxicity of elutriates was evaluated by standard assay protocols, using Daphnia spp. as test species (D. magna - standard species and D. longispina native species). Results. In opposition to what could be previewed based on total metal concentrations, results showed acute toxicity only in M site (low pH, high metal levels) in spring for both species with EC50=94.7% and 96.3% (D. longispina and D. magna respectively). A stimulatory effect (in growth and fecundity) was observed in the chronic assays, for almost all of the tested concentrations of the three elutriates tested - except for the highest concentrations of the M elutriate. Some differences were observed in the responses of Daphnia, both between test species and seasons. Differences between the two sampling periods were also found for pH. Discussion. Although some toxicity was observed in M, overall no toxicity was found for sediments of the aquatic system, corroborating previous results from our team (including whole-sediment tests). Differences in pH may explain the observed toxicity, acting both as a stressor and mobilizing contaminants. Stimulatory phenomena, typical when dealing with natural samples, worked as confounding factors. Several explanations should be considered for these stimulatory effects, however the role of radionuclides (not measured in this work) cannot be ignored. Conclusions. Supported by the results gathered in this study and in previous evaluations already performed, it is possible to state that in the present situation sediments plays a secondary role in the toxicity of the Cunha Baixa uranium mine, probably working more as a barrier than as a source of contaminants to the water column. However, future reclamation works in this area should carefully consider the remobilisation of sediments, especially from pond M. Recommendations and Perspectives. Radiochemical contamination is expected to be higher in field situations where radiation emitter isotopes are present in all the sediment compartment and overlying water, emitting radiations in all the directions. Thus whole-sediment and elutriate laboratory bioassays are not representative of long-term field exposures to radiation. Based on this supposition, these laboratory responses should be validated by field surveys of the benthic and planktonic freshwater communities of these ponds and freshwater receiving resources, at the higher tiers of the local ecological risk assessment.

N.			TEMPERATURE REACTIONS IN TWELVE SPECIES OF FRESHWATER CYCLOPOIDAE COPEPODS	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												The upper threshold of thermal resistance was first identified for twelve species of freshwater cyclops belonging to seven genera of the family Cyclopoidae using the method of critical thermal maximum (CTM). Cyclops were captured from one river, two lakes, eight ponds and one of the temporary reservoirs that are located in Central and North-Western Federal Districts of the Russian Federation in 2013-2015. The interspecies comparison of the CTM levels allowed dividing all the studied species into three groups - with low, medium and high values of this index. The analysis of own and literature data on temperature conditions for the development of the species in waterbodies showed that species with similar CTMs had the same requirements to the environment. Stenothermal winter cold-loving species (Cyclops insignis, C. kolensis, C. strenuus, Megacyclops gigas) were included to the group with low CTM values (30.3-33.3 degrees C). Eurybiontic cosmopolitan species (Macrocyclops albidus, Macrocyclops fuscus, Cyclops vicinus, Megacyclops viridis) were in the group with mean CTM values (34.9-36.6 degrees C). Summer eurythermic species (Eucyclops macrurus, Thermocyclops crassus, Mesocyclops leuckarti) were members of the group with high CTM values (37.2-39.6 degrees C). Extremely flexible, the eurytopic species Eucyclops serrulatus, which is active throughout the year within a wide temperature range, had the highest level of thermal resistance (40.0 degrees C), which confirms the hypothesis of southern tropical origin of the genus Eucyclops.					, Verbitskii/AAD-5232-2020; Medyantseva, Elena/O-4301-2014; Lazareva, Valentina/I-4530-2014; Grishanin, Andrey/J-2021-2016; Zhdanova, Svetlana/A-8802-2017	Medyantseva, Elena/0000-0003-1769-9068; Lazareva, Valentina/0000-0002-9620-9276; Grishanin, Andrey/0000-0002-6368-5807; 													0044-5134					JUL	2016	95	7					815	825		10.7868/S0044513416070138	http://dx.doi.org/10.7868/S0044513416070138													WOS:000385315300006

During sewage treatments, NP and OP were efficiently removed from the sewage effluents through activated sludge treatments. Greater removal for NP (93% on average) than OP (84% on average) was consistent. with their partitioning behavior to particles in primary and secondary effluents. NP concentrations in the river water samples ranged from 0.051 to 1.08 mug/L with higher concentrations in summer and spring than iii colder seasons. In the river water samples; similar to 20% of NP was found in the particulate phase. Organic. carbon-normalized apparent partition coefficients (K'(oc)) for NP (10(5.22 +/- 0.38)) and OP (10(4.65) (+/- 0.42)) Were 1 Order of magnitude higher than those expected from their octanol-water partition coefficients (K-ow), indicating strong affinity of APs tol aquatic particles. Among NP isomers, no significant differences in their K'(oc) values were suggested. This is consistent with surprisingly uniform isomer peak profiles among the technical standard and all the environmental samples analyzed. NP and OP were widely distributed in the river sediments in Tokyo, and relatively high concentrations (0.5-13.0 mug/g dry) of NP were observed in a long reach (similar to 10 km) in the Sumidagawa River. In situ production of APs in the river sediment was suggested. Seaward dec rea sing trend in APs concentration was observed from the estuary to the Tokyo Bay. APs were well preserved in a sediment core collected from the bay. The profile shows subsurface maximum of AP concentrations in the layer deposited around the mid-1970s. The recent decrease in AP concentrations can be attributed to the legal regulation of industrial wastewater in the early 1970s.

Experimental manipulations include whole lake and continuous stream fertilization as well as removal and addition of predators (copepods, lake trout, grayling, sculpin). Based on our evidence the following scenario is likely. Warming thaws the upper layers of permafrost and streams and lakes become enriched with phosphorus. Streams respond quickly with higher production of diatoms but animal grazers keep biomass changes to a minimum. Fish productivity also increases. If phosphorus levels are too high, mosses become the dominant primary producer and sequester all of the nutrients. Growth of Arctic grayling under the present conditions only occurs in summers with higher than average stream flow. The present population would be stressed by warmer temperatures. When higher phosphorus levels reach lakes and cause slight eutrophication, the number of trophic levels will increase, especially within the microbial food web. Warmer lake temperatures increase stratification and, combined with eutrophication, could decrease oxygen in the hypolimnion. Oxygen levels will also decrease in winter under the ice cover. Eventually this habitat change will eliminate the lake trout, a top predator. Removal of lake trout results in a striking increase in abundance and productivity of smaller fish, including small lake trout, and the emergence of burbot as an alternate top predator. Large species of zooplankton will become virtually extinct.

The Daily SST Variations within the South Eastern Mediterranean Sea	TWELFTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE MEDITERRANEAN COASTAL ENVIRONMENT (MEDCOAST 15), VOLS 1 AND 2					12th International Conference on the Mediterranean Coastal Environment (MEDCOAST)	OCT 06-10, 2015	Varna, BULGARIA	Mediterranean Coastal Fdn, Inst Oceanol, Inst Fish Resources, Republ Turkey, Promot Fund				Studying the behaviour of the sea surface temperature (SST) is important in the examination of many oceanographic activities. The variations in the SST are mainly controlled by atmospheric conditions. However, other physical parameters are also impacting on these variations, e.g. solar radiation, relative humidity, water depth, groundwater inflow and wind speed. Using a one year (04/02/99-04/02/00) data set, the present paper aims at describing the general behaviour of the daily SST variations within the south-eastern Mediterranean Sea region, off the Egyptian Mediterranean coast. The relationships between both the air temperature and wind speed, and the SST were built using regression techniques. The general pattern of the daily SST anomaly, produced in this research, reflects stability and homogeneity in the thermal distribution within the area of study. The seasonal presentation of the SST data reveals normal thermal variation behaviour, e.g. maxima in summer and minima in winter. There is a strong correlation between daily SST and air temperature variations, exceeding 0.91. The slightly differences between the produced mathematical constants may be attributed to both the change in the record periods and in the values of the recorded measurements. The inverse relationship between daily SST and wind speed variations is proved, with a correlation not exceeding -0.2. The observed odd behaviour of daily SST at location SST04, in the present study, is attributed to the shallowness of this station (7.8m depth) and also to the close position to the shore. Hence, seawater-seabed interaction and the shore processes may have their effects on the recorded SST. Moreover, SST04 is influenced by the dynamical process of the water exchange between Lake Manzalah and the Mediterranean Sea. The variations in the daily SST in the study area are more related to variations in air temperature rather than in wind speed.

Since that time, they have established themselves as permanent members of the Lake Superior ecosystem. Peak spawner densities were observed in the U.S. tributaries of Lake Superior in 1979 when many streams experienced runs of 10,000 fish or more. To better understand the population dynamics of pink salmon, population characteristics, fecundity, and egg deposition of spawners, egg and larval survival, and fry outmigration were studied in several Michigan and Minnesota tributaries in 1980. Population estimates indicate a significant decline of pink salmon in the U.S. waters of Lake Superior since 1979. This decline appears to be related to instream fry survival, which is in turn related to the hydrological conditions of the streams in fall and winter. Lake Superior pink salmon are phenotypically similar to their Pacific Coast counterparts, the major difference being age structure and smaller size of adults. Approximately 90% of the adults mature as 2-year-olds while the remaining 10% mature as 3-year-olds. Pink salmon maturing as 3-year-olds have different growth patterns than those maturing at 2 years of age. Two-year-old pink salmon average 390 mm in length, which is about 30% smaller than 2-year-olds from the Pacific Ocean. Three-year-old females have a lower fecundity and a poorer egg quality than 2-year-old females.																			0380-1330						1986	12	1					72	81		10.1016/S0380-1330(86)71701-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(86)71701-2													WOS:A1986A507400008

Shedding light on environmentally transmitted parasites: lighter conditions within lakes restrict epidemic size	ECOLOGY												Parasite fitness depends on a successful journey from one host to another. For parasites that are transmitted environmentally, abiotic conditions might modulate the success of this journey. Here we evaluate how light, a key abiotic factor, influences spatiotemporal patterns of zooplankton disease where light varies seasonally, across lakes, and with depth in a lake. In anin situexperiment using those three sources of variation, we tested sensitivity of spores of two parasites to ambient light. Infectivity of both parasites was lower when exposed to ambient light in comparison to parasites exposed to otherwise similar conditions in the dark. The more sensitive parasite (the fungus,Metschnikowia) was damaged even under lower ambient light during late fall (November). With this differential sensitivity established, we evaluated links between light environment and natural outbreaks in lakes. Consistent with the incubations, epidemics of the less sensitive parasite (the bacterium,Pasteuria) started earlier in the fall (under higher ambient light), and both parasites had smaller outbreaks in more transparent lakes. Overall, light environment may impact the timing and size of disease outbreaks. Outbreaks could thus become exacerbated by human activities that darken waters, including lake browning associated with climate change and eutrophication.

Network analysis reveals seasonal variation of co-occurrence correlations between Cyanobacteria and other bacterioplankton	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Association network approaches have recently been proposed as a means for exploring the associations between bacterial communities. In the present study, high-throughput sequencing was employed to investigate the seasonal variations in the composition of bacterioplankton communities in six eutrophic urban lakes of Nanjing City, China. Over 150,000 16S rRNA sequences were derived from 52 water samples, and correlation-based network analyses were conducted. Our results demonstrated that the architecture of the co-occurrence networks varied in different seasons. Cyanobacteria played various roles in the ecological networks during different seasons. Co-occurrence patterns revealed that members of Cyanobacteria shared a very similar niche and they had weak positive correlations with other phyla in summer. To explore the effect of environmental factors on species-species co-occurrence networks and to determine the most influential environmental factors, the original positive network was simplified by, module partitioning and by calculating module eigengenes. Module eigengene analysis indicated that temperature only affected some Cyanobacteria; the rest were mainly affected by nitrogen associated factors throughout the year. Cyanobacteria were dominant in summer which may result from strong co-occurrence patterns and suitable living conditions. Overall, this study has improved our understanding of the roles of Cyanobacteria and other bacterioplankton in ecological networks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Stored heat returning from the sediments warms adjacent water, which then sinks downslope. Water immediately beneath the ice moves laterally shoreward, picking up cryoconcentrated salts and sinking downslope. Displacement of deep waters upward at the lake center is postulated as completing the circulation. Rates of water movement are on the order of 10 m .cntdot. day in 2- to 10-ha lakes. This type of winter circulation is expected to be ubiquitous throughout the arctic.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1985	42	3					506	520		10.1139/f85-068	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f85-068													WOS:A1985AEK9300013

The lake water is acidified (pH=4.1) by the inflow of high-acidic thermal water (pH=1.2) from the Obuki Hot Spring, the main hot spring in the Tamagawa Hot Spring area. The vertical variations in Si, Al, Fe, Ti, and Pb contents of the sediment were determined by XRF, EPMA, and LA-ICP-MS in order to clarify the sedimentation processes of the lake sediment. The layers consisting of the sediment could be mostly classified into three types: dark brown, yellowish brown, and reddish layers. The contents of Si, Al, Fe, and Ti corresponded to the variation in color of each layer in the sample. Based on the Si, Al, and Fe contents in the sediment of Tamagawa Dam Lake, the sources of these elements were classified as detrital origin in dark brown and yellowish brown layers (Si, Al, and Ti) and chemical precipitate origin in reddish layers (Fe). Detrital components were derived from volcanic rocks in the watershed of Tamagawa Dam Lake. The variation of Pb content did not accord with the color of layers. The content of Pb in the sediment of Tamagawa Dam Lake ranges from 45 to 522ppm. The vertical variation of Pb content in sediment corresponded to the temporal variation of Pb content in thermal water from the Obuki Hot Spring from 1990 to 2012. A large influence of hydrothermal activity of the Tamagawa Hot Spring on the vertical distribution of Pb was found during the active period of the Obuki Hot Spring, resulting in high Pb content within layers at 5-8cm from the bottom of the sample. T-Fe2O3-rich reddish layers were also found in this range. Therefore, it is assumed that T-Fe2O3 and Pb originated from Obuki Hot Spring and precipitated in Tamagawa Dam Lake. However, no correlation was found between T-Fe2O3 and Pb contents for any of the dark brown, yellowish brown, and reddish layers. Some layers with high Pb content were also found to have high SiO2 and Al2O3 contents. These findings indicate that there are several possibilities for the sedimentation process of Pb. The sedimentation of Pb as well as that of T-Fe2O3 in Tamagawa Dam Lake provides a good example of the accumulation of elements by chemical precipitation away from the source of elements.

J	Harman, WN; Albright, MF				Harman, WN; Albright, MF			Trophic changes in Otsego Lake, NY following the introduction of the alewife (Alosa psuedoharengus)	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Changes at several trophic levels in Otsego Lake from the 1930s to present are described relative to changes in the planktivorous fish community. Prior to the late 1980s, cisco (Coregonus artedi) was the dominant planktivore. The alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) appeared in 1986 and subsequently became dominant. Two patterns emerged when we contrasted the pelagic flora and fauna under those two dominant planktivore populations. When cisco were the primary planktivores, cladoceran size and biomass was significantly greater in the epilimnion (primarily Daphnia pulex) than in the hypolimnion (primarily Bosmina coregoni). Phytoplankton were dominated by net and large nannoplankton (>0.03 mm), with cyanobacteria uncommon until late summer. From 1973-1988, mean summer chlorophyll a was 2.3+/-1.2 (S.D.) ug.L-1 (range 0.68-4.2). Mean summer Secchi transparency was 5.2+/-0.5 m (range 3.8-7.8). A real hypolimnetic oxygen deficits (AHOD; a measure of oxygen consumption during periods of stratification) were 0.076-0.080 mg.cm(-2).day(-1). Since alewife have dominated, Daphnia have become rare in the lake. Mean cladoceran size in the epilimnion and hypolimnion (essentially all Bosmina) is much more uniform and reduced from prior size distributions. Phytoplankton abundance has increased, as has the mean summer chlorophyll a (6.4+/-1.5 S.D ug.L-1, range 3-8.7). The dominant algae are now smaller nannoplankton (<0.03 mm) and cyanobacteria. Mean summer Secchi transparency decreased substantially to 3.2±0.3 m (range 2.5-4.0) and AHOD increased (range 0.090-0.102 mg.cm(-2).day(-1)). Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) and cisco have declined, while lake trout (Salvelinus namycush)have increased. All changes have occurred despite significant efforts to reduce non-point source nutrient loading to the lake. While the establishment of alewives has enhanced the production of Otsego Lake's salmonid fishery to date, it has increased the challenge to those interested in managing the lake in an ecologically sustainable manner.																			1040-2381					SEP	2002	18	3					215	226		10.1080/07438140209354150	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140209354150													WOS:000178771300004

Among these changes, rock glaciers release spring waters with rising solute concentrations, including nickel levels that significantly exceed drinking water limits. This study investigates the geochemical processes driving solute mobilization in five rock glaciers in the European Alps, focusing on nickel enrichment and transport pathways. Geochemical and petrographic analyses show that high nickel concentrations in spring waters originate from sulfide minerals and their weathering products. Sulfur and oxygen isotope analyses of dissolved sulfate confirm mineral weathering as the primary solute source, while inverse hydrogeochemical modeling accurately reproduces the chemical composition of these spring waters. The hydrogeology of rock glaciers plays a critical role in these processes, as deformation and ice melt expose fresh mineral surfaces, while extended residence times of water in the subsurface create favorable conditions for natural acid rock drainage. Our study demonstrates that rock glaciers are active chemical reactors, enriching alpine streams and lakes with metals and raising concerns about water quality and ecological impacts. This work advances understanding of climate-sensitive metal contamination, informing integrated water management strategies in mountain regions.

S.; Thakur, Biswajeet			Reconstructing climate variability during the last four millennia from trans-Himalaya (Ladakh-Karakoram, India) using multiple proxies	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												In this communication we reconstruct climate variability of Ladakh, Trans-Himalaya region, on sub-century timescale spanning the last four millennia (similar to 4130 to 260 cal yr 'before present' (BP)). To achieve this objective, we measured a suite of physical, biotic and inorganic proxies of a lacustrine sequence. In general, between similar to 4130 to similar to 2640 cal yr BP proxy records reveal climate variability following a typical pattern of the northern hemispheric climate and appear to be dominated by westerlies. Thereafter, the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) forcing appears to dominate regional climate. The former period appears to have experienced human presence as evidenced by an invasive species of diatom -Didymosphenia and charcoal, likely originating from human activities on trading routes with Central Asia, China and Tibet. After similar to 2640 cal yr BP, when ISM started governing the climate of the Ladakh-Karakoram region, it probably induced high-frequency climate variability leading to disasters related to landslides, debris flows, avalanches etc., eventually reducing the intra-boundary trade. A similar situation appears to be gripping the region again as meteorologically recorded precipitation data from Ladakh reveals arrival of high-frequency monsoonal variability in the region with recurrent flash floods (e.g., 2010, 2013).

The key mechanism is P sorption in soils. To provide some suggestions for increasing the sorption ability of P, the relationships between P sorption behavior and both land use patterns and distance from the shoreline were determined. Materials and methods In April, July, and October 2013, field investigations were carried out along the shoreline of Lake Chaohu. Eleven sections, including 36 sampling sites at different distances from the shoreline, were chosen, and these sections contained different types of riparian buffer strips, such as grassland, farmland, forest, wetland, and forest/grassland. The P species, sorption parameters, and dominant vegetation species were analyzed. Results and discussion The total P (TP) and P sorption maximum (Q(max)) showed no recognizable seasonal variation and were closely correlated with the distance from the shoreline. The further the distance from the shoreline, the higher the TP and Q(max) values, suggesting that soil traits could determine the P sorption extent. However, the Olsen-P content and equilibrium P concentration (EPC0) fluctuated greatly, with the peak occurring in spring and the minimum occurring in summer in the majority of the sampling sites. In addition, positive relationships existed between the TP content and the Q(max) value as well as the Olsen-P content and the EPC0 value. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) further showed that the Olsen-P content and EPC0 values were closely related to the dominant vegetation species, indicating that land use patterns played a decisive role in regulating the P sorption strength and the level of available P. Conclusions To effectively adsorb P (increase Q(max)) and prevent P leaching (reduce the EPC0), we recommend changing the land use patterns (more constructed wetlands and forests with grass) in riparian buffers.																			1439-0108	1614-7480				MAY	2019	19	5					2322	2329		10.1007/s11368-018-02232-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-018-02232-z													WOS:000464836300017

Population dynamics, distribution, and growth rate of tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) in the Salton Sea, California, with notes on bairdiella (Bairdiella icistia) and orangemouth corvina (Cynoscion xanthulus)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The Salton Sea is a highly saline lake that has long supported sportfishery and large populations of fish-eating birds. A study was initiated in 1999 to assess the status of orangemouth corvina (Cynoscion xanthulus), bairdiella (Bairdiella icistia) and tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus x O. urolepis). Multimesh (50 x 2 m) gillnets were set at nine stations in 1999, ten stations in 2000 and six stations in 2002. These stations were sampled every two months in 1999, every three months in 2000 and once in 2002. O. mossambicus was the most abundant of the four species, with a maximum mean catch per unit effort (CPUE) 13.8 kg net(-1) h(-1) or 29.9 fish net(-1) h(-1) being observed at the river mouth stations in August 1999. From spring to summer, tilapia CPUE increased at nearshore and river mouth stations and decreased at pelagic stations, apparently reflecting migration away from midlake areas in response to anoxia or hypoxia caused by periodic springtime overturn events in deep waters. Tilapia catches in nearshore, river mouth and pelagic habitats were 83 and 60% males in 1999 and 2000, respectively. Tilapia catches in rivers in August 1999 averaged only 6% male. During 1999-2000, the tilapia population consisted essentially of only the 1995 and 2000 year classes. Harsh conditions at the Salton Sea have led to erratic reproduction and survival rates and unstable age structures for its resident fishes. Massive parasite infestations of fry and physiological stressors such as anoxia, high sulfide levels, high salinity and high and low temperatures are potential causes of the irregular recruitment and periodic dieoffs of tilapia. The abundance of all fish species declined over the years of study. Between 1999 and 2002, the late summer mean CPUEs for tilapia, bairdiella and orangemouth corvina at four nearshore stations dropped from 16 fish to 0.02 fish, from 4.7 fish net to 0.23 fish, and from 0.08 fish to 0.02 fish, respectively. During 2000-2003, parallel declines occurred in estimated numbers of adult fish involved in mass mortality events at the Sea. The boom-and-bust dynamics of tilapia and other fish populations in the Sea have major consequences for fish-eating bird populations, for other components of the ecosystem, and for the recreational value of the lake.					; Costa-Pierce, Barry/H-5069-2011; Riedel, Ralf/AAK-3807-2021	Costa-Pierce, Barry Antonio/0000-0003-3059-1828; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2007	576						185	203		10.1007/s10750-006-0301-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0301-2													WOS:000243089500015

Very little work has been done studying the northern fluids, although yearly samples are collected from a handful of locations for monitoring purposes. In this study, we examine fluids from the Tikitere and Rotoma-Tikorangi geothermal fields, which are located along the northern OVC boundary near Lakes Rotoiti, Rotoehu and Rotoma and compare them to published, historical data from the region and more recent monitoring data where available. Samples taken from the lakeshores of Lake Rotoiti and at Waitangi Soda Springs indicate bicarbonate-chloride rich fluids that show minimal changes since 1970. Alkali geothermometer temperatures estimating reservoir temperatures range from around 220 at Waitangi Soda Springs to 290 degrees C at Manupirua Spring and show great consistency over the years despite their equilibrium immaturity. In contrast, slightly further south and higher in elevation, the Hells Gate Thermal Park, a popular tourist location, has a wider range of hotter geothermometer temperatures and features acid-sulfate fluids. There have been noticeable changes here since 1970, with new pools formed, and an evident enrichment in stable water isotopes, indicating greater water rock interactions and greater evaporation have occurred over time. Overall, hydrothermal fluids from the northern Okataina Volcanic Centre show good stability and low eruption risk at present time.

J	MATTHEWS, SB				MATTHEWS, SB			AN ASSESSMENT OF BISON HABITAT IN THE MILLS MINK LAKES AREA, NORTHWEST-TERRITORIES, USING LANDSAT THEMATIC MAPPER DATA	ARCTIC												Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper data were used to classify and map wood bison (Bison bison athabascae) habitat in an area of 3383.5 km2 in the vicinity of Mills and Mink lakes, Northwest Territories. Digital image analysis techniques were used to enhance and classify satellite data acquired 31 August 1986 to determine the distribution and extent of forage habitats. Visual interpretation of cover types was carried out using a radiometric enhancement, consisting of a power contrast stretch, applied to spectral bands 5 (shortwave), 4 (near infrared), and 3 (red) and displayed as a colour composite image (red/green/blue). A DIPIX Technologies ARIES III image analysis system was used to perform an unsupervised classification of 16 spectral classes using a maximum likelihood classifier. The resultant thematic map was used during the summer of 1988, when aerial and ground surveys of the study area were carried out. Colour infrared photographs (1:20 000 scale) obtained in 1988 were also used as part of the reference data set to assist in selecting training areas for use in a supervised classification. Ground data were also collected during the summer of 1989 to increase the number of training areas and provide test sites for an accuracy assessment. In the final habitat classification, the ten physiognomic cover types were water, aspen forest, coniferous/mixed forest, sedge meadow, willow savanna, hordeum meadow, wetland complex, peat plateau/burned meadow, burned peat plateau, and burn-aspen regeneration. The Thematic Mapper data was geometrically corrected and smoothed using a post-classification filter. Results of the digital image analysis were produced as hard copy thermatic maps and tabular summaries. Overall accuracy of the classification was 91% with the two important winter forage habitats - sedge meadow and willow savanna - having accuracies of 95% and 75% respectively. These forage habitats collectively represent 4.6% of the study area, or 153.3 km2. Digital image analysis of Landsat Thematic Mapper data proved to be an effective and cost efficient method of mapping bison habitat in a large area of the boreal forest.																			0004-0843						1991	44			1			75	80																WOS:A1991GV42500013

Humans and animals at Bugul'deika II, a Trans-Holocene habitation site on the shore of Lake Baikal, Russia	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												This paper examines Holocene tends in subsistence practices through the examination of archaeological faunal remains from the Bugul'deika II habitation site on the west shore of Lake Baikal, Russian Federation. This data indicates that the primary focus of subsistence activities at the site in almost all periods was the hunting of Baikal seals (Phoca sibirica). While some deer and other fauna are represented in most cultural layers, they appear to be supplementary resources throughout the Early and Middle Holocene period of site use. By similar to 2900 cal. BP, domesticated ungulates appear at the site, and become increasingly more relatively abundant through time. Humans using the site during these periods also continued to use wild fauna, particularly Baikal seals. Yearlings and other juveniles were the most commonly taken seals at the site, and most were killed in the late winter or early spring when the lake was ice covered. The overall pattern of fauna use at the site is very similar to that at other sites located on the open shoreline of Lake Baikal, but contrasts sharply with fauna use at sites located along the Little Sea shoreline of the lake, which focuses of littoral fish. Finally, while Middle Holocene human cemeteries in the study area have abundant remains of deer, and stable isotope data on human remains from them indicate some dietary reliance on such herbivores, remains of deer are not found in abundance in any local habitation site.

Understanding their variation is crucial for accurate evaluation and prediction of changes in water supply and for retrieval and analysis of climatic information. Data from previous research on 35 alpine lakes on the Tibetan Plateau were used to investigate changes in lake water level and area. In terms of temporal changes, the area of the 35 alpine lakes could be divided into five groups: rising, falling-rising, rising-falling, fluctuating, and falling. In terms of spatial changes, the area of alpine lakes in the Himalayan Mountains, the Karakoram Mountains, and the Qaidam Basin tended to decrease; the area of lakes in the Naqu region and the Kunlun Mountains increased; and the area of lakes in the Hoh Xil region and Qilian Mountains fluctuated. Changes in lake water level and area were correlated with regional changes in climate. Reasons for changes in these lakes on the Tibetan Plateau were analyzed, including precipitation and evaporation from meteorological data, glacier meltwater from the Chinese glacier inventories. Several key problems, e.g. challenges of monitoring water balance, limitations to glacial area detection, uncertainties in detecting lake water-level variations and variable region boundaries of lake change types on the Tibetan Plateau were discussed. This research has most indicative significance to regional climate change.

Changed cycling of P, N, Si, and DOC in Danish Lake Nordborg after aluminum treatment	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Loading, retention, and in-lake cycling of phosphorus (P), nitrogen, silica, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were studied 1 year before and 3 years after P-inactivation by aluminum (Al) hydroxide in Danish Lake Nordborg in 2006. Simultaneously, external P loading was reduced by 40% via establishment of precipitation ponds in two inlets. After Al treatment, the internal P loading (sediment P release) during summer declined 90%-94%, owing to adsorption to aluminum hydroxide. Also, silicate regeneration from the sediment was reduced by 69%-76%, and sediment oxygen uptake as well as ammonium release declined markedly. Consequently, lake water total P, dissolved inorganic P, silicate, and DOC decreased by 73%, 97%, 87%, and 46%, respectively. The Secchi depth increased in the summer period during the first post-treatment year, but declined afterwards to pre-treatment levels, even though the mean lake-water total P concentration during summer was reduced from similar to 240 mu g.L(-1) before treatment to 26-65 mu g.L(-1) in the first three post-treatment years. We conclude that a further reduction in external P loading is needed to obtain the full effect of the Al treatment in Lake Nordborg.

Diamond Lake is a large natural lake, located in the Cascade Mountain range of central Oregon, less than 20 miles from Crater Lake. The introduction of a non-native fish species has resulted in a biological change in the lake that has reduced water quality and changed the use patterns at the lake. Diamond Lake users are generally satisfied with their recreation experience, but some differences were noted between the summer 2001 and summer 2003 recreation seasons. Although several of the quality domains and satisfaction items were significantly different between the 2001 users and the 2003 users, overall quality remained the same.																									2004	326						139	144																WOS:000230926200021

Pools play an important role in the peatland carbon cycle by releasing carbon dioxide and methane to the atmosphere. However, the origin of this carbon is not well constrained. A hypothesis is that the majority of the carbon emitted from pools predominantly originates from mineralized allochthonous (i.e., plant-derived) dissolved organic matter (DOM) from peat rather than in situ primary production. To test this hypothesis, this study examined the origin, composition, and degradability of DOM in peat porewater and pools of an ombrotrophic boreal peatland in northeastern Quebec (Canada) for 2 years over the growing season. The temporal evolution of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, the optical properties, molecular composition (THM-GC-MS), stable isotopic signature (delta C-13-DOC), and degradability of DOM were determined. This study demonstrates that DOM, in both peat porewater and pools, presents a diverse composition and constitutes highly dynamic components of peatland ecosystems. The molecular and isotopic analyses showed that DOM in pools was derived from plants. However, DOM compositions in the two environments were markedly different. Peat porewater DOM was more aromatic, with a higher molecular weight and DOC : DON (dissolved organic nitrogen) ratio compared to pools. The temporal dynamics of DOC concentration and DOM composition also differed. In peat porewater, the DOC concentration followed a strong seasonal increase, starting from 9 mg L-1 and reaching a plateau above 20 mg L-1 in summer and autumn. This was explained by seasonal peatland vegetation productivity, which is greater than microbial DOM degradation. In pools, DOC concentration also increased but remained 2 times lower than in the peat porewaters at the end of the growing season ( similar to 10 mg L-1). Those differences might be explained by a combination of physical, chemical, and biological factors. The limited hydraulic conductivity in deeper peat horizons and associated DOM residence time might have favored both DOM microbial transformation within the peat and the interaction of DOM aromatic compounds with the peat matrix, explaining part of the shift of DOM compositions between peat porewater and pools. This study did not report any photolability of DOM and only limited microbial degradability. Thus, it is likely that the DOM might have been microbially transformed at the interface between peat and pools. The combination of DOM quantitative and qualitative analyses presented in this study demonstrates that most of the carbon present within and released from the pools originates from peat vegetation. These results demonstrate that pools represent a key component of the peatland ecosystem ecological and biogeochemical functioning.

During the fall and winter of 2001 - 2002, two single-point current meters (a Nobska MAVS-3SL and a Sontek Hydra) and an acoustic Doppler current meter (RD Instruments 1200 KHz Workhorse ADCP Waves Array) were deployed in the southwest end of Lake Ontario. All 3 units were deployed on bottom mounted support frames within 100 metres of each other in 12 metres of water. The single-point devices measured approximately one metre off the bottom and the lowest bin of the ADCP was 0.5 metres higher in elevation. Ambient water temperatures ranged from approximately 2.5 to 11degreesC over the deployment period. Mean currents for each system compared favourably. Analysis of the individual components of velocity indicated a good comparison between the single-point current meters but the agreement with the two lowest ADCP bins was not as good. Short-term (single burst) velocity spectra from the MAVS and the Hydra showed good agreement during significant events. However, during quiet periods, the Hydra spectra had a fairly high noise floor, probably due to the reduced number of reflecting particles in the water. Comparison of directional wave data between the three sensor types showed good agreement of the characteristic wave height and fair to good agreement of the peak period and the peak direction.																					0-7803-7534-3				2002							724	729																WOS:000182293200115
J	Trimble, RM; Appleby, ME				Trimble, RM; Appleby, ME			Comparison of efficacy of programs using insecticide and insecticide plus mating disruption for controlling the obliquebanded leafroller in apple (Lepidoptera: tortricidae)	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY												The relative efficacy of an insecticide program and an insecticide plus mating disruption program using a sprayable pheromone formulation or a hand-applied pheromone dispenser was compared for control of the obliquebanded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris) at three commercial apple farms in a production area along the north shore of Lake Ontario, Canada, during 2000, 2001,and 2002. The average rate of disruption ranged from 50 to 80% in blocks of orchard treated with sprayable pheromone and from 84 to 98% in blocks treated with the hand-applied dispenser. The average proportion of shoots with larval feeding injury ranged from 0.002 to 0.09, 0.001 to 0.09, and 0.005 to 0.13 in the insecticide. insecticide plus sprayable pheromone, and insecticide plus hand-applied dispenser treatments, respectively, during the 3-yr study. The percentage of fruit with damage caused by spring, summer and overwintering larvae ranged from 0.03 to 0.06, 0.01 to 0.02, and 0.01 to 0.03 in the insecticide, insecticide plus sprayable pheromone, and insecticide plus hand-applied dispenser treatments, respectively. The addition of sex pheromone-mediated mating disruption to a conventional, insecticide-based program did not provide additional control of C rosaceana feeding injury to shoots or fruit. The possible reasons for the failure of mating disruption to provide additional control are discussed.																			0022-0493	1938-291X				APR	2004	97	2					518	524		10.1603/0022-0493-97.2.518	http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-0493-97.2.518								15154476					WOS:000221038400046
J	Heyer, J; Berger, U; Kuzin, IL; Yakovlev, ON				Heyer, J; Berger, U; Kuzin, IL; Yakovlev, ON			Methane emissions from different ecosystem structures of the subarctic tundra in Western Siberia during midsummer and during the thawing period	TELLUS SERIES B-CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL METEOROLOGY												Methane emission was measured using a static chamber method at seven different ecosystem structures of the subarctic tundra oil the Yamal Peninsula (West Siberian Lowlands, Russia) in August 1995 midsummer) and June 1996 (spring thaw). The results obtained represent one of the most extensive data sets available for Siberian tundra and confirm the significance of this area as an important source of atmospheric methane. Mean midsummer emission rates (4.24-195.3 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) were higher than mean rates reported for wetlands between 65-70degreesN in Alaska, Sweden and Russia. The highest emission rates were measured ill a lake terrestrialization mire which was always flooded, the lowest rates at a dry site in a polygonal mire. Mean emission rates during spring thaw ranged from 0.16 to 56.2 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1). These rates increased at 4 out of 5 sites from 2.4-15.1 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) at the beginning of the measuring period to 24.2-156 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) at the end. The water-table level was the crucial parameter influencing spatial variation of methane emission rates, while temperature was the most important factor controlling temporal variation, especially during spring thaw. However, short-term changes of air temperature had no effect, and diurnal variation of methane emissions was never detected. In addition to the direct influence of temperature oil methanogenesis, the indirect effect on soil thawing was apparent. Increasing thawing depth was positively correlated with methane emission. Rapid alterations of the water table also resulted in large episodic methane emissions. Methane emission exceeded the calculated methane production in spring, suggesting that accumulated methane from the previous year was also released. The results show that considerable methane emission occurs even in the spring without an active vegetation cover and without plant-mediated methane transport. This is a consequence Of high methane production rates even at low temperatures, and of methane release via diffusion as the main transport pathway from the soil into the atmosphere.																			0280-6509					JUL	2002	54	3					231	249		10.1034/j.1600-0889.2002.01280.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0889.2002.01280.x													WOS:000176671600004
J	Pellicori, DA; Gammons, CH; Poulson, SR				Pellicori, DA; Gammons, CH; Poulson, SR			Geochemistry and stable isotope composition of the Berkeley pit lake and surrounding mine waters, Butte, Montana	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Samples of mine water from Butte, Montana were collected for paired geochemical and stable isotopic analysis. The samples included two sets of depth profiles from the acidic Berkeley pit lake, deep groundwater from several mine shafts in the adjacent flooded underground mine workings, and the acidic Horseshoe Bend Spring. Beginning in July-2000, the spring was a major surface water input into the Berkeley pit lake. Vertical trends in major ions and heavy metals in the pit lake show major changes across a chemocline at 10-20 m depth. The chemocline most likely represents the boundary between pre-2000 and post-2000 lake water, with lower salinity, modified Horseshoe Bend Spring water on top of higher salinity lake water below. Based on stable isotope results, the deep pit lake has lost approximately 12% of its initial water to evaporation, while the shallow lake is up to 25% evaporated. The stable isotopic composition Of SO4 in the pit lake is similar to that of Horseshoe Bend Spring, but differs markedly from SO4 in the surrounding flooded mine shafts. The latter is heavier in both 634 S and 6180, which may be due to dissolution of hypogene SO4 minerals (anhydrite, gypsum, barite) in the ore deposit. The isotopic and geochemical evidence suggests that much of the SO4 and dissolved heavy metals in the deep Berkeley pit lake were generated in situ, either by leaching of soluble salts from the weathered pit walls as the lake waters rose, or by subaqueous oxidation of pyrite on the submerged mine walls by dissolved Fe(III). Laboratory experiments were performed to contrast the isotopic composition Of SO4 formed by aerobic leaching of weathered wallrock vs. SO4 from anaerobic pyrite oxidation. The results suggest that both processes were likely important in the evolution of the Berkeley pit lake. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Since spawning of many resident species followed the spring freshet, yellow perch (Perca flavescens), darters, and many cyprinids sensitive to low pH would hatch and develop following the most serious spring changes in chemistry. Within a lake, the period of peak abundance occurred within a period of 2-9 wk during the 3 yr of study. Abundance of yoy was not strongly linked to lake pH or alkalinity. Diversity of yoy was strongly related to lake pH (r = 0.87) and alkalinity (r = 0.89). Monitoring the larval fish community appears to provide a responsive, reproducible measure of change for some of the fish communities sensitive to effects of acidic deposition and can be carried out with only moderate expenditure of time and resources.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1988	45			1			121	126																WOS:A1988Q784000015

This study focuses on the Corfu killifish (or toothcarp) Valencia letourneuxi (Sauvage, 1880) that is endemic to the western part of the Ionian Ecoregion, and reported in Albania in the past from a single location, Lake Butrinti. Recently, in June 2019, the species has been rediscovered at a very low population density (only 11 individuals collected) in a spring-fed stream in the vicinity of Lake Butrinti. Other fish present together with V. letourneuxi were the native Telestes pleurobipunctatus, Barbus peloponnesius, Anguilla anguilla and Pelasgus thesproticus and the translocated Alburnus sp. Our findings provide useful insights into the ecology and conservation of a Critically Endangered, range-restricted species and its habitats.

The first step to effectively, efficiently, and sustainably utilizing the services that the lake may provide is to understand its water balance using accurate estimations of its water balance parameters, including direct rainfall. Direct rainfall to Lake Tana is one of the most important water balance terms of the Lake that needs a precise estimate. This study tries to analyze the spatial and temporal variability of direct rainfall to the Lake and estimate the mean annual and mean monthly direct rainfall amount to the lake using sufficient data and appropriate methodologies. 30 years (1986-2015) monthly and mean annual data from 13 meteorological stations were collected and used to analyses the spatial and temporal variability. Spatial and statistical tools were used for data processing, analysis, and presentation. Five interpolation techniques:- Thiessen polygon, spline, isohyetal, inverse distance weighting, and Kriging were considered and their performances were assessed and compared using evaluation criteria. The results indicate that the Isohytal method is slightly better than the other four methods and it is also easy to implement in a geographic information system (GIS) with Geostatic Analysis in ArcGIS. Further, the analysis has shown that the mean annual direct rainfall to Lake Tana is 1313.43 mm with a standard deviation of 259.01. Besides, it has been seen that there is a significant spatial and temporal variability of direct rainfall on Lake Tana. In terms of spatial variability, the Lake gets maximum direct rainfall in its southeastern part with an annual mean value of 1720 mm and a minimum value in its northwest parts with an annual mean value of 860 mm. In terms of Temporal variability, maximum direct rainfall is estimated in July as 374.11 mm in the Summer season and the minimum is less than 12.3 mm depth in December, January, February, and March in Winter.

J	Granvik, M; Brown, P				Granvik, Mikael; Brown, Peter			Identification of meteorite source regions in the Solar System	ICARUS												Over the past decade there has been a large increase in the number of automated camera networks that monitor the sky for fireballs. One of the goals of these networks is to provide the necessary information for linking meteorites to their pre-impact, heliocentric orbits and ultimately to their source regions in the solar system. We re-compute heliocentric orbits for the 25 meteorite falls published to date from original data sources. Using these orbits, we constrain their most likely escape routes from the main asteroid belt and the cometary region by utilizing a state-of-the-art orbit model of the near-Earth-object population, which includes a size-dependence in delivery efficiency. While we find that our general results for escape routes are comparable to previous work, the role of trajectory measurement uncertainty in escape-route identification is explored for the first time. Moreover, our improved size-dependent delivery model substantially changes likely escape routes for several meteorite falls, most notably Tagish Lake which seems unlikely to have originated in the outer main belt as previously suggested. We find that reducing the uncertainty of fireball velocity measurements below similar to 0.1 km/s does not lead to reduced uncertainties in the identification of their escape routes from the asteroid belt and, further, their ultimate source regions. This analysis suggests that camera networks should be optimized for the largest possible number of meteorite recoveries with measured speed precisions of order 0.1 km/s. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Experiments exploring the effects of thermophysical properties and geometrical parameters on the droplet and jet flow patterns are described. Measurements of droplet and jet departure-sire spacing are reported for several fluids over a wide range of liquid flow rates, tube sizes and tube spicing. For the conditions of this study, departure-site spacing increased with decreasing Re for high-Ga fluids and was nearly independent of Re for low-Ga fluids. Departure-site spacing increased slightly with tube diameter for small tubes and was nearly independent or tube size for large tubes. Departure-site spacing was nearly independent of tube spacing for the entire range of experiments; however, a relation between jet shape, jet spacing and tube spacing was observed under some conditions. A qualitative study of liquid-jet shapes shows that this How feature depends strongly on tube spacing, and comparisons to existing models suggest that further work in this area is needed.

We compared taphonomic alteration among freshwater gastropods in live, dead (surficial shell accumulations), and fossil (late Pleistocene-early Holocene in situ sediments) assemblages from two Florida spring-fed systems, the Wakulla and Silver/Ocklawaha Rivers. We assessed taphonomy of two gastropod species: the nativeElimia floridensis(n= 2504) and introducedMelanoides tuberculata(n= 168). We quantified seven taphonomic attributes (aperture condition, color, fragmentation, abrasion, juvenile spire condition, dissolution, and exterior luster) and combined those attributes into a total taphonomic score (TT). FossilE. floridensisspecimens exhibited the greatest degradation (highest TT scores), whereas live specimens of both species were least degraded. Specimens ofE. floridensisfrom death assemblages were less altered than fossil specimens of the same species. Within death assemblages, specimens ofM. tuberculatawere significantly less altered than specimens ofE. floridensis, but highly degraded specimens dominated in both species. Radiocarbon dates on fossils clustered between 9792 and 7087 cal BP, whereas death assemblage ages ranged from 10,692 to 1173 cal BP. Possible explanations for the observed taphonomic patterns include: (1) rapid taphonomic shell alteration, (2) prolonged near-surface exposure to moderate alteration rates, and/or (3) introduction of reworked fossil shells into surficial assemblages. Combined radiocarbon dates and taphonomic analyses suggest that all these processes may have played a role in death assemblage formation. In these fluvial settings, shell accumulations develop as a complex mixture of specimens derived from multiple sources and characterized by multimillennial time-averaging. These findings suggest that, when available, fossil assemblages may be more appropriate than death assemblages for assessing preindustrial faunal associations and recent anthropogenic changes in freshwater ecosystems.					; Kowalewski, Michal/B-4263-2008	Portell, Roger/0000-0002-3306-2115; Kowalewski, Michal/0000-0002-8575-4711; Kusnerik, Kristopher/0000-0003-4511-6966; Means, Guy/0000-0003-3401-0891; Brenner, Mark/0000-0001-9837-012X													0094-8373	1938-5331				AUG	2020	46	3					356	378	PII S0094837320000251	10.1017/pab.2020.25	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/pab.2020.25													WOS:000566760700006
J	Wu, KS; Johnston, CA				Wu, Kangsheng; Johnston, Carol A.			Hydrologic comparison between a forested and a wetland/lake dominated watershed using SWAT	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is a physically-based hydrologic model developed for agricultural watersheds, which has been infrequently validated for forested watersheds, particularly those with deep overwinter snow accumulation and abundant lakes and wetlands. The goal of this study was to determine the applicability of SWAT for modelling streamflow in two watersheds of the Ontonagon River basin of northern Michigan which differ in proportion of wetland and lake area. The forest-dominated East Branch watershed contains 17% wetland and lake area, whereas the wetland/lake-dominated Middle Branch watershed contains 26% wetland and take area. The specific objectives were to: (1) calibrate and validate SWAT models for the East Branch and Middle Branch watersheds to simulate monthly stream flow, and (2) compare the effects of wetland and lake abundance on the magnitude and timing of streamflow. Model calibration and validation was satisfactory, as determined by deviation of discharge D and Nash and Sutcliffe coefficient values E that compared simulated monthly mean discharge versus measured monthly mean discharge. Streamflow simulation discrepancies occurred during summer and fall months and dry years. Several snow melting parameters were found to be critical for the SWAT simulation: TIMP (snow temperature lag factor) and SMFMX and SMFMN (melting factors). Snow melting parameters were not transferable between adjacent watersheds. Differences in seasonal pattern of long-term monthly streamflow were found, with the forest-dominated watershed having a higher peak flow during April but a lower flow during the remainder of the year in comparison to the wetland and lake-dominated watershed. The results suggested that a greater proportion of wetland and lake area increases the capacity of a watershed to impound surface runoff and to delay storm and snow melting events. Representation of wetlands and lakes in a watershed model is required to simulate monthly stream flow in a wetland/lake-dominated watershed. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Spatial Distribution of Water Composition of the Swamp Massif within the Kuchiger Discharge Area of Hydrothermal Waters	GEOCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL												Electric conductivity and the activities of the Na+, Ca2+, Cl-, and F- ions were determined in the thermal spring waters, the surface waters of the Kuchiger swamp massif, the waters accumulated on the soil surface after heavy rains in the concave topographic elements of the alluvial plains, the waters of a streamlet that originates in the Barguzin Range, the waters of the Indikhan River, and the groundwaters. Indicator parameters of different water types were determined to significantly vary within Ulyunkhan depression. Narrow ranges were determined for the variations in the composition of the hot springs and wide ones were found in the composition of the warm and cold springs. Statistical distributions of the measured parameters of the swamp waters were shifted toward higher values compared to those of the discharged thermal waters. The following three features of the spatial distribution of water composition indicators have been identified: (1) a spotty character, (2) a trend in the water composition in the direction of transit according to the general slope of the terrain, and (3) a trend of increasing salt content in the waters near the outer shoreline of the swamp massif and around islands within it.

L-1) in southeastern Alberta [Canada] to compare relationships between phosphorus, nitrogen, and phytoplankton standing crop with those in freshwater lakes. In 18 lakes, Na+, Mg2+, SO42-, and HCO3--CO32- were the dominant ions. In these lakes there was a significant positive correlation between Ca2+ and chlorophyll a (Chl a), and there were significant negative correlations between Chl a and conductivity, pH, Na+, Mg2+, SO42-, HCO3-, and CO32-. When all 20 lakes were considered there were no significant relationships between Chl a and phosphorus or nitrogen. Empirical relationships for freshwater lakes, based on spring or summer total phosphorus (TP) or total nitrogen (TN), overestimated Chl a in all the study lakes. However, in saline lakes with similar ionic composition and TN to TP ratios greater than 12 (by weight), there was a significant positive relatioship between TP and Chl a. For the saline lakes with TN to TP ratios greater than 12, the deviations between the Chl a levels predicted from models developed for freshwater lakes and the observed levels were positively correlated with conductivity, total dissolved solids, and Na+ (r2 = 0.78-0.82, P < 0.001). We developed the first empirical model that describes nutrient-Chl a relationships for inland saline lakes. The deviation of measured phytoplankton biomass from that predicted by models developed for freshwater lakes can be explained by conductivity or dominant ion concentration.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1985	42	10					1588	1594		10.1139/f85-199	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f85-199													WOS:A1985ASS5100003

A 420-Year Perspective on Winter Lake Erie Levels	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Here, we present a 420-year-long winter lake level reconstruction for Lake Erie based primarily on temperature-sensitive tree-ring chronologies from Alaska, Oregon, and California. This well-verified model explains more than 51% of the variance in winter lake levels over a 131-year calibration period (1860-1990) and shows strong decadal fluctuations related to changes in sea surface temperatures in the North Pacific and the North Atlantic, which alternate in terms of their relative influence. Decadal variability is superimposed on a persistent secular lake level rise that began in the mid-1900s coinciding with a growing influence of the Atlantic sector. In the context of the last 420 years, the instrumental period experienced extreme lake levels, with the lowest over the entire record during the Dustbowl and the highest in 2020. Fluctuations in Lake Erie water levels are primarily determined by climate, and their variability greatly impacts the region's infrastructure and ecosystems.

Similarity of structure of taxonomic bacterial communities in the photic layer of Lake Baikal's three basins differing in spring phytoplankton composition and abundance	DOKLADY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOPHYSICS												Pyrosequencing of amplicons V3-V4 of the 16S rRNA gene of 30 samples from the photic layer across the three basins of Lake Baikal has revealed 44 958 sequences of the domain Bacteria. The most representative phylums among all classified sequences in the samples were Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Cyanobacteria. As much as 38.5% of the total number of sequences has been determined to the level of genus. The taxonomic composition of bacterial communities was similar regardless of some differences in the composition and abundance of spring phytoplankton. Closely related or identical sequences of bacteria inhabiting the epilimnion of other lakes worldwide have been discovered for most sequences. This confirms the similarity of microbial communities in freshwater ecosystems.

The effects of cyanobacterial blooms on the immune system of Elliptio complanata in urban and agricultural areas in the Yamaska River watershed	ISJ-INVERTEBRATE SURVIVAL JOURNAL												The cumulative effects of cyanobacterial blooms at sites impacted by urban or agricultural activity, could be detrimental to local freshwater mussels. The purpose of this study was to examine and compare the resulting toxicity using an upstream-downstream approach at four sites in the Yamaska River. Mussels were caged and placed at a site where cyanobacterial blooms were present, a site that receives municipal effluent from a small city of 75,000 inhabitants, and a site that drains a large agricultural area-plus a reference site in Lake Saint-Pierre (Quebec, Canada) for four months spanning the summer and fall (June to October). Effects on immunocompetence were monitored by testing for hemocyte counts, viability, phagocytosis, production of nitric oxide (NO), lysozyme (LY), reactive oxygen species (ROS), thiol contents, and inflammation induced by cyclooxygenase (COX) activity and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity. Cyanobacterial blooms occurred at the target site only, reaching levels of 2.1 million cyanobacteria/L and 3 mu g/L of microcystin-LR in surface waters. Although most of the immune parameters were affected at the urban, agricultural and cyanobacteria sites, ROS and LY were the most responsive to cyanobacterial bloom, with a significantly greater response than the agriculture, urban and reference sites. The results also suggest that the effects of cyanobacterial blooms are spatially localized; they are not found at the downstream urban and agriculture sites in the Yamaska River.

Water columns and pore-waters from sediments were analysed for Fe species, trace elements (As, Cd, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn, Cr), sulphide, sulphate and bicarbonate. Inorganic reduced sulphur compounds (acid volatile sulphur, pyrite sulphur and elemental sulphur) and reactive Fe were determined in the sediments. A sequential extraction was also performed. Both reservoirs behave like holomictic and monomictic lakes, with a summer thermal stratification that disappears during winter. pH values between 4 and 7 can be observed along the water columns. Pore-water concentrations of up to 25 mg/l of Fe, 4 mg/l of Al, 1.3 mg/l of Zn, 170 mu g/l of Pb, 11 mu g/l of As, etc. have been found. The results suggest that toxic elements such as Cu, Zn, Co, Pb, Cr, As, etc. are mainly found in the bioavailable fraction which is the most hazardous for the environment. The calculated degree of sulphidization (DOS) and degree of pyritization (DOP) values indicates that removal of trace elements from anoxic pore-waters occurs by coprecipitation and/or adsorption on newly formed Fe sulphides (framboidal pyrite), attenuating the contamination. However oxidation of the sediments during turnover periods also occurs, which releases toxic elements back into the water column. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Assessing seasonal variation in counts and movements of Bonaparte's Gulls Larus philadelphia on the Niagara River, Ontario	WATERBIRDS												We assessed potential factors contributing to variation in counts of staging Bonaparte's Gulls (Larus philadelphia) on the Niagara River in southern Ontario. Much of the Mississippi Flyway population of this species stages each autumn at this site, en route to the Gulf coast and Mexico. Between 1986-96, weekly or bi-weekly counts were made of gulls flying to their nocturnal roost at the mouth of the Niagara River entering Lake Ontario, to assess the seasonal and temporal patterns of movement. Counts began each year in early October, corresponding to the 'second wave' of gulls. Generally, this second wave of autumn movements began in early October to late November (median 1 November) and continued until late January or mid-February (median 5 February). Model selection based on a repeated measures analysis (Generalized Estimating Equations) demonstrated a quadratic relationship between counts and time of year and a linear relationship with daily count duration. Less evidence existed for the role of mean daily temperature in explaining variation (positive relationship) in counts; more data, or inclusion of different weather variables (e.g., wind, cloud cover), may demonstrate that it is more important than our models suggest. Maximum counts were from early November to late January (median 6 December). Peak daily totals per season varied between 6,300 (1993/94) and 40,000 (1990/91). Migration counts may be useful to help monitor populations of this species, provided that variables affecting seasonality in counts are accounted for and the turn-over rate of individual gulls staging in the area is determined (e.g., through mark-recapture or radio-telemetry studies).

J	Wen, M; Yang, S; Higgins, W; Zhang, RH				Wen, Min; Yang, Song; Higgins, Wayne; Zhang, Renhe			Characteristics of the Dominant Modes of Atmospheric Quasi-Biweekly Oscillation over Tropical-Subtropical Americas	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												During the boreal summer (June-August), vigorous convection appears over the eastern Pacific, southern Mexico, and northern South America, and oscillates on a distinct time scale of 10-20 days. Extended empirical orthogonal function (EEOF) analysis shows that the quasi-biweekly oscillation (QBWO) of the convection has two major modes: a west-east-orientated mode (WEM) and a north-south-orientated mode (NSM). The WEM, which is explained by the first two EEOF modes, originates over the eastern Atlantic, propagates westward along 15 degrees N, and enhances over the Caribbean Sea before disappearing over the central Pacific. The NSM, explained by the third and fourth EEOF modes, originates over the western Pacific, moves eastward, and strengthens over the eastern Pacific. It shifts northward after arriving over the Caribbean Sea. Both modes have notable seasonal dependence, with the WEM more active in July and August and the NSM more active in June or earlier. The two distinct QBWO modes are linked to different rainfall patterns over the United States and Mexico. When the WEM is active in July and August, wet conditions occur over the southern central United States and dry conditions appear to the north. When the NSM is active in June, northern Mexico, the southwestern United States, the Missouri basin, and the northern Great Lakes are drier than normal, while southern Mexico and the eastern United States are wetter than normal. Significant variations in atmospheric circulation are found to be associated with the interannual variability of the NSM activity in June. However, these variations may not necessarily result from QBWO but, rather, provide a background for QBWO activity instead. In July and August, the association of QBWO with the precipitation pattern over North America may sometimes be related to hurricane activity.

Then, based on the feature parameters of activity path information, machine learning method (k-means) is used to classify the trajectories of spring Mongolian cyclone. Subsequently, the atmospheric circulation configurations of the three categories of Mongolian cyclones and their influence on the weather in China verify the reasonability of the classification method. Specifically: (1) eastward moving type, affecting Inner Mongolia and Northeast China (Clus-1). The circulation background of the Clus-1 cyclone displays a broad negative geopotential height anomaly centre over East Asia; (2) northeastward moving type, affecting northeast part of Northeast China (Clus-2). The circulation background of the Clus-2 cyclones shows a "positive-negative-positive" distribution of circulation anomalies in the European Plain, Lake Baikal and the Sea of Japan; (3) southeastward moving type, this type can move to the south of China (Clus-3). The circulation background of the Clus-3 cyclones is opposite to that of the Clus-2 cyclones. The three categories of Mongolian cyclones will cause dust weather and strong winds in different regions of China, mainly affecting Inner Mongolia and Northeast China.

In particular, attention to Hg species transfer between watershed components (upland soils, groundwater, wetlands, streams, and lakes) has been lacking. This study describes spatial and temporal distributions of total Hg and MeHg among watershed components of the Allequash Creek watershed (northern Wisconsin, USA). Substantial increases in total Hg and MeHg were observed as groundwater discharged through peat to form springs that flow into the stream, or rivulets that drain across the surface of the wetland. This increase was concomitant with increases in DOC. During fall, when the Allequash Creek wetland released a substantial amount of DOC to the stream, a 2-3 fold increase in total Hg concentrations was observed along the entire length of the stream. Methylmercury, however, did not show a similar response. Substantial variability was observed in total Hg (0.9 to 6.3) and MeHg (<0.02 to 0.33) concentrations during synoptic surveys of the entire creek. For the Allequash Creek watershed, the contributing groundwater basin is about 50% larger than the topographic drainage basin. Total Hg concentrations in groundwater, the area of the groundwater basin, and annual stream flow data give a watershed-yield rate of 1.2 mg/km(2)/d, which equates to a retention rate of 96%. The calculated MeHg yield rate for the wetland area is 0.6 to 1.5 mg/km(2)/d, a value that is 3-6 fold greater than the atmospheric deposition rate.

Shifts in Carbon Emissions Versus Sequestration From Hydropower Reservoirs in the Southeastern United States	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Reservoirs are a significant source of carbon (C) to the atmosphere, but their emission rates vary in space and time. We compared C emissions via diffusive and ebullitive pathways at several stations in six large hydropower reservoirs in the southeastern US that were previously sampled in summer 2012. We found that carbon dioxide (CO2) diffusion was the dominant flux pathway during 2012 and 2022, with only three exceptions where methane (CH4) diffusion or CH4 ebullition dominated. CH4 diffusion rates were positively associated with water temperature. However, we found no clear predictors of CH4 ebullition, which had extremely high variability, with rates ranging from 0 to 739 mg C m-2 day-1. For CO2 diffusion, the direction of the flux shifted between 2012 and 2022, where all but three stations across all reservoirs emitted CO2 in summer 2012, but every station sequestered CO2 in summer 2022. Here, indicators of greater algal production were associated with CO2 sequestration, including surface chlorophyll-a concentration, surface dissolved oxygen saturation, and pH. Additional sampling campaigns outside the summer season highlighted the importance of seasonal phenology in primary production on the direction of CO2 diffusive fluxes, which shifted to positive CO2 fluxes by the end of August as productivity decreased. Our results demonstrate the importance of capturing CO2 sequestration in field and modeling measurements and understanding the seasonal drivers of these estimates. Measuring C emissions from multiple pathways in reservoirs and understanding their spatiotemporal responses and variability are vital to reducing uncertainties in global upscaling efforts. Inland waters, including reservoirs used for many different purposes, contribute greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane to the atmosphere. With 34 times more global warming potential than carbon dioxide, methane is of particular concern since reservoirs emit disproportionally large amounts of it. However, our ability to quantify reservoir emissions is limited by high variability in these emissions over space and time. In this study, we measured emissions from several stations across six reservoirs and compared these emissions to a previous study from 2012 to understand potential longer-term variation in emissions and assess driver variables. Overall, we found that algal productivity was an important driver of fluxes among the reservoirs and could in fact lead to carbon dioxide sequestration. However, the seasonal phenology in algal productivity and related variables were also important to understand when considering emissions variability within a reservoir and over time. As we continue to collect emissions measurements from reservoirs, studies focused on multiple spatial and temporal scales (i.e., day and night) can improve upscaled estimates of greenhouse gas emissions to better quantify the role of reservoirs in the global carbon cycle. Reservoirs are a major source of carbon emissions, but spatial and temporal variability leads to uncertain modeled or upscaled estimates Across six reservoirs, summer CO2 diffusion was the dominant flux pathway and showed sequestration, linked to increased algal productivity Changes in algal productivity influence the direction of CO2 diffusion with key implications for assessing net reservoir emissions					; Griffiths, Natalie/C-3087-2012; Phillips, Jana/G-4755-2016; Matson, Paul/AAB-9767-2019; Hansen, Carly/AAW-5192-2021; Jager, Henriette/OGQ-5439-2025	Fortner, Allison/0000-0002-1871-1236; Pilla, Rachel/0000-0001-9156-9486; Hansen, Carly/0000-0001-9328-0838; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				JUL	2024	129	7							e2023JG007580	10.1029/2023JG007580	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023JG007580													WOS:001279882100001
J	Champagne, O; Arain, MA; Coulibaly, P				Champagne, Olivier; Arain, M. Altaf; Coulibaly, Paulin			Atmospheric circulation amplifies shift of winter streamflow in southern Ontario	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Flooding is a major concern for Canadian society as it is the costliest natural disaster type in Canada. Southern Ontario, which houses one-third of the Canadian population, is located in an area of high vulnerability for floods. The most significant floods in the region have historically occurred during the months of March and April due to snowmelt coupled with extreme rain events. However, during the last three decades, there has been a shift of flooding events to earlier months. The aim of this study was to understand the impacts of atmospheric circulation on the temporal shift of streamflow and high flow events observed in southern Ontario over 1957-2013 period. Predominant weather regimes over North America, corresponding to recurrent meteorological situations, were identified using a discretization of daily geopotential height at 500HpA level (Z500). A regime-normalized hypothetical temperature and precipitation dataset was constructed to quantify the contribution of atmospheric circulation on streamflow response. The hypothetical dataset was used as input in the Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS), a rainfall-runoff semi-distributed hydrological model, and applied to four watersheds in southern Ontario. The results showed an increase in the temporal frequency of the regime identified here as High Pressure (HP) close to eight occurrences per decade. Regime HP, characterized by a northern position of the polar vortex, is correlated with a positive phase of the NAO and is associated with warm and wet conditions over southern Ontario during winter. The temporal increase in HP contributed more than 40% of the increase in streamflow in winter and 30-45% decrease in streamflow in April. This atmospheric situation also contributed to increase the number of high flows by 25-50% in January. These results are important to improve the seasonal forecasting of high flows and to assess the uncertainty in the temporal evolution of streamflow in the Great Lakes region.

J	Weynell, M; Wiechert, U; Zhang, CJ				Weynell, Marc; Wiechert, Uwe; Zhang, Chengjun			Chemical and isotopic (O, H, C) composition of surface waters in the catchment of Lake Donggi Cona (NW China) and implications for paleoenvironmental reconstructions	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												The oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon isotope ratios and major and trace element concentrations of surface waters are reported for the catchment of Lake Donggi Cona, Qinghai Province, China. The chemistry of the surface waters in the southeastern catchment is reflecting the dissolution of carbonate rocks, whereas thermal waters add sodium and chlorine to the waters in the northern catchment. The Dongqu River, draining the southeast catchment, contributes 87 to 94% to the water budget of the lake. Thermal waters and waters from the northern catchment add 6 to 13%. The combination of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes provides evidence that only small amounts of recycled lake water contribute to the precipitation in the catchment. Most of the moisture may be transported by the East Asian summer monsoon or an eastern branch of the South Asian monsoon into the Donggi Cona region. From oxygen isotope ratios it is calculated that about 45% of the lake water input is evaporated and 55% leaves the lake through a channeled outflow. The carbon isotope ratios identifies microbial respiration of organic matter, probably in soils and sediments of the catchment, as the major source of dissolved inorganic carbon in most surface waters and the lake. An isotope effect, from biological processes, in the lake is minor, and can be neglected in order to explain isotope ratios of inorganic carbon in lake water. The results imply that oxygen isotope ratios in the lake sediment archives mainly mirror the relation between precipitation and evaporation (P/E), which may be controlled by changes in the global water cycle like monsoon intensity or by tectonically driven local changes affecting the outflow flux. A comparison between lake archives based on ostracod shells and the modern system indicates similar delta O-18 values for the lake water since 4.3 ka but different delta C-13(DIC) values. This discrepancy between carbon isotope ratios in ostracod shells andmodern lakewater samplesmay be due to thermal waters with high delta C-13(DIC) emerging near the coring site. It is suggested that carbon isotopes of ostracods from a sediment drill core reflect the activity of a local thermal spring at the lake bottom, whereas oxygen isotopes provide evidence for an open lake systemsince about 11 ka and that the climate and environment of theDonggi Cona region changed very little over the last 4300 years.

The hydrological shift has accelerated the early development of Carex spp.-dominated meadows, resulting in phenological mismatches between Carex brevicuspis (the primary food source for herbivorous geese) and the arrival of herbivorous geese. This mismatch has reduced suitable food resources for these geese during their wintering period. This study aimed to assess how mowing treatments mitigate this mismatch by improving the quality of C. brevicuspis. During the 2023/2024 wintering season, we studied the effects of mowing treatments on C. brevicuspis and the underlying mechanisms. Three treatments were applied: complete mowing (CM; stubble height < 0.3 cm), stubble mowing (SM; stubble height 15 cm), and no mowing (CK). The results showed that mowing treatments significantly increased leaf moisture and nitrogen content, reduced crude fiber content, and thereby increased the quality and food utilization rates by herbivorous geese. Additionally, mowing increased the quality of C. brevicuspis by stimulating compensatory growth responses, which relies on the resources of the belowground bud banks mechanisms. However, mowing treatments also significantly decreased plant height, density, aboveground biomass, and the biomass of belowground bud banks, which potentially impairs the long-term recovery and sustainability of plant. Therefore, while targeted mowing can effectively improve the food quality for herbivorous geese during wintering, careful consideration of the management of mowing frequency and intensity are essential to maintain balance between the wetland vegetation recovery and the sustainable food supply for herbivorous geese.

In this study, we investigate the response of the Great Lakes Basin to increasing greenhouse gas and aerosols emissions using an ensemble of sixteen climate change simulations generated by three different Regional Climate Models (RCMs): CRCM4, HadRM3 and WRFG. Annual and monthly means of simulated hydro-meteorological variables that affect Great Lakes levels are first compared to observation-based estimates. The climate change signal is then assessed by computing differences between simulated future (2041-2070) and present (1971-1999) climates. Finally, an analysis of the annual minima and maxima of the Net Basin Supply (NBS), derived from the simulated NBS components, is conducted using Generalized Extreme Value distribution. Results reveal notable model differences in simulated water budget components throughout the year, especially for the lake evaporation component. These differences are reflected in the resulting NBS. Although uncertainties in observation-based estimates are quite large, our analysis indicates that all three RCMs tend to underestimate NBS in late summer and fall, which is related to biases in simulated runoff, lake evaporation, and over-lake precipitation. The climate change signal derived from the total ensemble mean indicates no change in future mean annual NBS. However, our analysis suggests an amplification of the NBS annual cycle and an intensification of the annual NBS minima in future climate. This emphasizes the need for an adaptive management of water to minimize potential negative implications associated with more severe and frequent NBS minima.

Blackwater Creek supported a mean number of 112 (range 0-434) and Rock Springs Run 89 nymphs per m(2) (range 11-258). The mayfly species displayed a univoltine life history with adult emergence peaking in August. Productivity in Blackwater Creek was estimated at 4.688 g per m(2) and in Rock Springs Run at 3.123 g per m(2). Productivity/biomass ratios were estimated at 4.09 and 4.59 in Blackwater Creek and Rock Springs Run, respectively. The nymphal densities in both streams were positively correlated with water pH and negatively correlated with water volume. Apparently, water volume was the overriding abiotic factor in both streams, influencing several measured water parameters and as well as nymphal populations during the study period.

In this paper, we investigated the restoration process occurring consequently to the conversion of a drained area in a natural wetland system (NWS) (the partial top soil removal, the realization of a perimeter levee to contain the waters, the rewetting with the drainage waters coming from the of surrounding cultivated areas) and the capability of the spontaneous vegetation to catch nutrients acting as a vegetation filter. To follow the restoration process over time (2012-2016), we used a mixed approach merging phytosociological surveys with ortophotos taken by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). During the last year of observation (2016), we performed destructive sampling on the most widespread plant communities in the area (Phragmites australis and Myriophyllum aquaticum community) to quantify the biomass production and the uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus. Stands of Phragmites australis (Cay.) Trin. ex Steud. yielded more than Myriophyllum aquaticum (Veil.) Verdc. (4.94 kg m-2 vs 1.08 kg m-2). M. aquaticum showed higher nutrient contents (2.04% of N and 0.35% of P), however P. australis was able to take up more nutrients within the NWS because of its larger cover and productivity. In the perspective of maximizing the plant development and consequently the amount of nutrients extracted from treated waters, the authors suggest 4-5 year-long-harvesting turns, better occurring in spring-summer.

Predation by Northern Pikeminnow and Tiger Muskellunge on Juvenile Salmonids in a High-Head Reservoir: Implications for Anadromous Fish Reintroductions	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The feasibility of reintroducing anadromous salmonids into reservoirs above high-head dams is affected by the suitability of the reservoir habitat for rearing and the interactions of the resident fish with introduced fish. We evaluated the predation risk to anadromous salmonids considered for reintroduction in Merwin Reservoir on the North Fork Lewis River in Washington State for two reservoir use-scenarios: year-round rearing and smolt migration. We characterized the role of the primary predators, Northern Pikeminnow Ptychocheilus oregonensis and tiger muskellunge (Northern Pike Esox lucius x Muskellunge E. masquinongy), by using stable isotopes and stomach content analysis, quantified seasonal, per capita predation using bioenergetics modeling, and evaluated the size and age structures of the populations. We then combined these inputs to estimate predation rates of size-structured population units. Northern Pikeminnow of FL >= 300 mm were highly cannibalistic and exhibited modest, seasonal, per capita predation on salmonids, but they were disproportionately much less abundant than smaller, less piscivorous, conspecifics. The annual predation on kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka (in biomass) by a size-structured unit of 1,000 Northern Pikeminnow having a FL >= 300 mm was analogous to 16,000-40,000 age-0 spring Chinook Salmon O. tshawytscha rearing year-round, or 400-1,000 age-1 smolts migrating April-June. The per capita consumption of salmonids by Northern Pikeminnow having a FL >= 200 mm was relatively low, due in large part to spatial segregation during the summer and the skewed size distribution of the predator population. Tiger muskellunge fed heavily on Northern Pikeminnow, other nonsalmonids, and minimally on salmonids. In addition to cannibalism within the Northern Pikeminnow population, predation by tiger muskellunge likely contributed to the low recruitment of larger (more piscivorous) Northern Pikeminnow, thereby decreasing the risk of predation to salmonids. This study highlights the importance of evaluating trophic interactions within reservoirs slated for reintroduction with anadromous salmonids, as they can be functional migration corridors and may offer profitable juvenile-rearing habitats despite hosting abundant predator populations.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					2016	145	3					521	536		10.1080/00028487.2015.1131746	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2015.1131746													WOS:000379058600007

These blooms have become more severe, with record events occurring in 2011 and 2015, and have compromised public safety, leading to do-not-drink advisories and negatively impacting the economy of the Western Lake Erie basin. To determine the potential benefits of avoiding nutrient application during high rainfall events compared to dry periods, we analyzed scenarios using three Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological models developed for the Maumee River Watershed. These SWAT models were developed by three different institutes and calibrated for flow and nutrient loadings at the watershed outlet. The scenarios varied the timing of nutrient (fertilizer as well as manure) applications at the hydrological response unit (HRU; smallest unit of a model) level based on the risk of rainfall events and included a (1) worst-condition scenario, in which nutrients were applied just before rain events having a high-risk of runoff and a (2) best-condition scenario, in which nutrients were applied during periods carrying a low-risk of runoff. The results demonstrate that applying nutrients during low-risk rainfall events reduced nitrate runoff by 10.9 %, total phosphorus by 1.2 %, and dissolved reactive phosphorus by 3.8 % during the spring season compared to high-risk rainfall events. While, the nitrate, total phosphorus and dissolved reactive phosphorus reductions were 6 % 0.7 % and 2.6 %, respectively on the annual scale. Additionally, nutrient application during high-risk rainfall events led to a reduction in crop yields, with soybean yields decreasing by 4.4 %, corn and rye by 3 %, and winter wheat by up to 5.5 %. These findings underscore the importance of optimizing nutrient application timing to minimize nutrient runoff and enhance crop productivity, contributing to improved water quality in the Great Lakes region.

J	Lin, SQ; Huang, LF; Zhu, ZS; Jia, XY				Lin, Shiquan; Huang, Lingfeng; Zhu, Zhisheng; Jia, Xiaoyan			Changes in size and trophic structure of the nanoflagellate assemblage in response to a spring phytoplankton bloom in the central Yellow Sea	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												On a multidisciplinary investigation cruise from March 25 to April 14, 2009, the dynamics of the nanoflagellate (NF) assemblage in response to a spring phytoplankton bloom was observed in the central Yellow Sea (similar to 33.5-37 degrees N, similar to 120.5-124.5 degrees E). The water mass of the bloom was followed with a drifting buoy-guided Lagrangian tracing approach. The results showed that the abundance, biomass, cell size composition and trophic structure of NFs dramatically changed with the succession of the bloom. Compared with that in the Pre-bloom phase, the cell abundance and biomass of NFs increased more than two-fold in the Bloom phase and the Post-bloom phase in the water column, respectively, especially in the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) layer. NF cell abundance was composed mainly of 2-5 mu m pigmented photosynthetic nanoflagellates (PNFs), whose rapid growth in response to the bloom outbreak characterized the NF dynamics in the bloom phase. Although larger (5-20 mu m) flagellates constituted less than 20% of NF cell abundance in most samples, they accounted for a rather larger percentage in NF biomass, especially in the bloom decline phase, when the response of the NF assemblage to the spring bloom was characterized by a dramatic increase in NF biomass, mainly contributed by 10-20 mu m PNFs and non-pigmented heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNFs). Compared to PNFs, HNFs showed a rather mild response during the bloom, especially in the 2-5 mu m fraction, which decreased during the bloom, despite a significant increase of both HNFs and PNFs in the early stage of the bloom. However, when PNFs were declining in the Post-bloom phase, HNFs, especially the 5-10 mu m fraction, had in contrast shown an ascending trend. This is the first systematic report on short-term dynamics of different nano-sized flagellate components, and our results suggested an inherent mechanism associated with cell size as well as trophic strategies for the dynamics of the NF assemblage in response to the spring phytoplankton bloom, within which mixotrophy in PNFs might play a substantially important role.

The sediment traps were deployed at depths of 30 and 70 m. On a global scale, BSi fluxes in Lake Biwa were very high, ranging from 20 to 1087 mg Si.m(-2).d(-1) at the 30 m trap and 12-999 mg Si.m(-2).d(-1) at the 70 m trap throughout the observation period. The BSi fluxes at both traps increased significantly during the winter period and the ratio of BSi fluxes in the winter period to annual BSi fluxes ranged from 27 to 62%. In the winter period, when nutrients are supplied from the hypolimnion to the epilimnion, the distribution of photosynthetically active diatoms was almost homogeneous in all layers, including the aphotic layer. At this time, the diatoms assimilated dissolved silica (DSi) in a wider layer containing a part of aphotic layer in order to produce rigid frustules, which accumulated rapidly in bottom sediments as DSi concentration in the water column decreased. Thus, size of the silica sink in Lake Biwa is enhanced during the winter holomictic mixing period through interaction between physical (thermocline disruption: transfer of diatoms to deep layers by vertical convection), chemical (nutrient supply from deep layers) and biological (dominance of active diatoms in all layers) processes.																			0003-4088	2100-000X					2013	49	2					139	147		10.1051/limn/2013045	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2013045													WOS:000322859900007

At several travel destinations, climate represents a natural resource on which the tourism industry is predicated. Data covering the period 1985-2005 and from a dense network of 15 meteorological stations was used to compute the Physiologically Equivalent Temperature (PET) and 'tourism climate index' (TCI) in Northwest of Iran. The cities Maku, Ahar, Ardabil, Takab, Khoy, Ourimeh and Sarah have a summer peak distribution. Each of these locations has at least I month with a TO score above 80: this level can be classified to be an 'excellent' tourism climate. The cities Maku, Ardabli and Takab have TCI above 90, an 'ideal' tourism climate for the summer months. Among these cities, Ardabil has the most favourable climatic conditions for tourist attractiveness in the Summer. The cities Mahabad, Jolfa, Marageh, Sagez and Parsabad have a bimodal-shoulder peak distribution. In addition, based on calculations of PET in Ourmieh Lake coast it is shown that the months June, July and August are lying in the comfortable class representing the most suitable months for tourism and tourist activities.

Using multiple archives to understand past and present climate-human-environment interactions: the lake Erhai catchment, Yunnan Province, China	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY					10th International Paleolimnology Symposium	JUN, 2006	Duluth, MN					A 6.48 m sediment core sequence from Erhai lake, Yunnan Province, provides a multi-proxy record of Holocene environmental evolution and human activity in southwest China. These sedimentary records provide proxy time series for catchment vegetation, flooding, soil erosion, sediment sources and metal workings. They are complemented by independent regional climate time-series from speleothems, archaeological records of human habitation, and a detailed documented environmental history. The article attempts to integrate these data sources to provide a Holocene scale record of environmental change and human-environment interactions. These interactions are analysed in order to identify the roles of climate and social drivers on environmental change, and the lessons that may be learned about the future sustainability of the landscape. The main conclusions are: lake sediment evidence for human impacts from at least 7,500 cal year BP is supported by a terrestrial record of cultural horizons that may extend back to similar to 9,000 cal year BP. A major shift in the pollen assemblage, defined by detrended correspondence analysis, at similar to 4,800 cal year BP marks the transition from a 'nature-dominated' to a 'human-dominated' landscape. From 4,300 cal year BP, a change in river discharge responses may signal the beginning of hydraulic modification through drainage and irrigation. Major increases in disturbed land taxa and loss of forest taxa from 2,200 cal year BP onward, also associated with the start of significant topsoil erosion, register the expansion of agriculture by Han peoples. It is also the start of silver smelting linked to trade along the SW Silk Road with Dali becoming a regional centre. Peak levels of disturbed land taxa, topsoil and gully erosion are associated with the rise and fall of the Nanzhao (CE 738-902) and Dali (CE 937-1253) Kingdoms, and the documented environmental crisis that occurred in the late Ming and Qing dynasties (CE 1644-1911). The crisis coincides with a stronger summer monsoon, but exploitation of marginal agricultural land is the main driver. These historical perspectives provide insight into the resilience and sustainability of the modern agricultural system. The largest threat comes from high magnitude-low frequency flooding of lower dry farmed terraces and irrigated valley plains. A sustainable future depends on reducing the use of high altitude and steep slopes for grazing and cultivation, maintaining engineered flood defences and terraces, and anticipating the behaviour of the summer monsoon.

J	Hudson, AM; Quade, J				Hudson, Adam M.; Quade, Jay			Long-term east-west asymmetry in monsoon rainfall on the Tibetan Plateau	GEOLOGY												Variations in the strength and duration of the Asian Monsoon affect more than half the population of the planet, and there is intense interest in where, and how much, rainfall amounts will change regionally in response to warmer climate conditions. The modern monsoon region is divided into distinct subsystems, so the response may be regionally heterogeneous. Northern Hemisphere monsoon systems intensified during the early to mid-Holocene, increasing summer rainfall and creating wetter conditions across much of eastern Asia. In this study we use the area encompassed by high shorelines of early Holocene paleolakes in Tibet to reconstruct paleorainfall (and hence paleomonsoon) patterns during this very wet period. We found that the early Holocene relative paleolake expansions of 130 closed-basin lake systems in the central Tibetan Plateau display a strong east-west gradient. Paleolake areas expanded by approximately fourfold in the western plateau, compared to approximately twofold expansion in the eastern region. This early Holocene pattern mirrors the modern west-east climate division on the plateau: rainfall in the west is closely tied to the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) subsystem, and in the east is closely tied to a probable mix of ISM and East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) subsystems. Our results suggest that these modern climate divisions are an enduring feature of the plateau and that ISM rainfall increased much more than EASM rainfall in response to the same insolation forcing.

J	Zhang, X; Wu, BY; Ding, SY; Yu, QK				Zhang, Xiang; Wu, Bingyi; Ding, Shuoyi; Yu, Qikai			Combined effects of Arctic tropospheric warming and La Nina events on enhanced Eurasian cold anomalies	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												This study investigates the combined effects of Arctic tropospheric warming and La Nina events on climate variations in Eurasia during boreal winter by utilizing the reanalysis data and the output of CMIP6 models. Results show that the "Warm Arctic-Cold Eurasia" pattern emerges with enhanced intensity under the combined effects compared with the individual effect of Arctic tropospheric warming or La Nina events. The significantly intensified Eurasian cold anomaly is observed in the north of Lake Baikal during the combined years. However, this cold anomaly shrinks substantially in warm Arctic years while shifting southwestward with a weaker intensity in La Nin similar to a years. Additionally, the winter atmospheric variability under the combined effects is much stronger than that under the individual effect of these two factors. Further investigation reveals that the La Nin similar to a event is probably crucial to dominating the basic distribution of winter temperature variability and the associ-ated tropospheric circulation anomalies. Recent Arctic tropospheric warm anomalies are also essential, possibly amplifying the impact of the La Nin similar to a event on Eurasia through the weakened stratospheric polar vortex. These two factors jointly contribute to the enhanced " + -+ " wave train that displays over mid-high latitudes under the combined effects. This " + -+ " wave train exhibits alternative anticyclonic, cyclonic, and anticyclonic circulation anomalies over the Ural Mountains, Lake Baikal, and North Pacific, respectively. It guides wave energy from the Barents-Kara Seas (BKS) along the Ural Mountains to Lake Baikal and promotes the development of the Ural blocking anomaly that favors the intensified extreme cold temperature in Eurasia. The results of the CMIP6 models largely replicate some major features of the combined effects in the observations.

More detailed studies were provided on 19 lakes with daily hydrological and thermic observations in the calendar years 2000-2016. Climate warming is clearly observed in observational temperature data, with increases of 0.2-0.4 degrees C per decade. Slightly lower air temperatures and a higher annual sum of precipitation in relationship to neighboring regions are specific for the Polish Lakelands. Mean annual air temperature in the eastern part is 1.5 degrees C lower than in the western regions. Much greater variation of precipitation and climatic water balance was noted, where the Wielkopolskie and Lubuskie Lake Districts have a permanent water deficit that is not observed in the rest of the Lakelands. Polish postglacial lakes are characterized by generally small fluctuations in water level, whereas variations in artificially regulated lakes are higher than in lakes with a natural regime, as well as a higher frequency of decreasing water level trends. Only a few lakes have a statistically significant increase of lake water temperature, mostly in northeastern Poland. A simulation indicated that in year 2050 the annual lake water temperature will be 1.1-1.9 degrees C higher than at present. We can expect more evident changes in lake functioning in spring and summer, shifting lakes toward higher trophy, but dystrophic lakes will remain more humic when their hydrology is stable.																			1433-6863		978-3-030-12123-5; 978-3-030-12122-8				2020	86						1	25		10.1007/978-3-030-12123-5_1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-12123-5_1	10.1007/978-3-030-12123-5												WOS:000487329500003
J	Page, B; Badiou, P; Steele, O				Page, Bryan; Badiou, Pascal; Steele, Owen			Nutrient retention of newly restored wetlands receiving agricultural runoff in a temperate region of North America	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Globally, eutrophication is deemed to be the greatest threat to freshwater resources and is particularly problematic for large shallow lakes where the prevalence of cyanobacterial blooms has increased in recent decades. Restored wetlands have been identified as natural infrastructure that can reduce nutrient loads from agricultural landscapes, thereby reducing eutrophication in downstream freshwater systems. While restored wetlands are generally accepted as efficient nutrient transformers and processors, there are relatively few studies that examine nutrient retention based on detailed hydrological budgets across seasons. We determined the nutrient retention capacity for phosphorus and nitrogen species of newly restored wetlands (<8 years old) receiving nonpoint source agricultural runoff over two water years. These restored wetlands are located in an intensive agricultural region that contributes to the central and western basin of Lake Erie. Two-year mean TP and TN wetland retention capacities were 11.7 +/- 5.9 and 261.2 +/- 112.3 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Two-year mean TP and TN wetland retention efficiencies were 46 +/- 13 and 47 +/- 8%, respectively. The mean SRP retention capacity and reduction efficiency over the two-year monitoring period were 4.8 +/- 1.7 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) and 60 +/- 11%, respectively. Investigating data over two water years revealed that nutrient retention was noticeably different across seasons for both TP and TN, with the highest retention occurring in summer for TP (5.7 +/- 2.7 kg P ha(-1)) and in the spring for TN (99.9 +/- 50.0 kg N ha(-1)). Our findings demonstrate that restored wetlands in agriculturally intensive temperate regions designed primarily for wildlife habitat can effectively reduce nonpoint source nutrients under a range of hydrological conditions. However, further research is needed to investigate the long-term effectiveness of restored wetlands as natural infrastructure for nutrient reduction, and to evaluate the potential environmental trade-offs and economic benefits of their implementation.					; Badiou, Pascal/H-3841-2019	Badiou, Pascal/0000-0001-9753-943X; 													0925-8574	1872-6992				OCT	2023	195								107060	10.1016/j.ecoleng.2023.107060	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2023.107060		AUG 2023											WOS:001063151700001

Boron and lithium are incorporated in fertilizers for agriculture and they used in many industries. Economically lithium is considered a strategic element because it is important in energy markets. There are two main economically recoverable sources of lithium, those being mineral ores and the evaporate deposits (playa lakes, called "salars" in Spanish). Direct extraction of lithium from brines at the salars is a low cost method and generates byproducts such as boron. Salars with high concentrations of Li have been reported in the Andean region near the borders of Chile, Bolivia, and Argentina. In Chile, the brines at Salar de Atacama are considered an important commercial source of lithium. To the northeast of Salar de Atacama it is located Salar de Ascotan (21 degrees 27'01, 9 '' S; 68 degrees 15'8,5 '' W) where the commercial boron extraction has been done for many decades but lacks published information about lithium extraction. In this study concentrations and distribution of lithium and boron in the water, sediment and salt crust were analyzed in some of the east-side springs which have a high endemic biodiversity. The concentrations in the salt crust were higher than in water and sediment. Geographically, the concentration of lithium in salt crust increases from north to south, but the boron concentration was higher in the extreme north and south, in the southernmost spring, N degrees 11. The average concentration of B in the salt crust was 149 [mg/Kg] and for Li was 3000 [mg/Kg] at the east side of the salar, thus it is the area with the highest concentration of lithium and boron. The concentrations in the salt crust were high and geographically heterogeneous for using a non-invasive method, for environmental protection we propose an exploration superficial on the western side which lack spring water and present the higher concentration of lithium and boron of the salar.																			0717-9707					SEP	2019	64	3					4538	4541		10.4067/S0717-97072019000304538	http://dx.doi.org/10.4067/S0717-97072019000304538													WOS:000495892300007

J	Harasti, D; Williams, J; Mitchell, E; Lindfield, S; Jordan, A				Harasti, David; Williams, Joel; Mitchell, Emma; Lindfield, Steven; Jordan, Alan			Increase in Relative Abundance and Size of Snapper Chrysophrys auratus Within Partially-Protected and No-Take Areas in a Temperate Marine Protected Area	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are known to contribute toward the conservation of marine biodiversity, particularly targeted fishery species. Snapper Chrysophrys auratus are an important recreational and commercial fish species in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, and despite fishery management for this species, they are considered "growth overfished" in this region. To assess how C. auratus respond to the implementation of an MPA with several no-take and partially protected areas in temperate NSW, we monitored their populations over a decade (2006-2017) using baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVs). Surveys were conducted in the Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park with BRUVs deployed on rocky reefs in depths of 20-50 m. Long term seasonal sampling (winter vs. summer) was undertaken at two locations (Broughton and Fingal Island), and changes in C. auratus abundance prior to, and 8 years after zoning implementation, were assessed between these two locations. In total, we sampled five no-take areas within the marine park and five comparative nearby partially protected fished areas and three sites located outside the marine park boundaries. The most pronounced changes in abundance and size structure for C. auratus were observed in the Broughton Island no-take area where numbers increased almost 3-fold (2.91 times) over 8 years of protection. Relative abundance showed seasonal variation at two locations, and we consistently recorded increasing abundance within no-take areas at Broughton and Fingal Island compared to nearby sites open to fishing. Surveys across the five no-take areas found a significant increase in the abundance of C. auratus, whilst the five partially-protected locations in the marine park still recorded higher abundances than sites outside the marine park. In addition, length measurements from stereo-BRUVS indicated that C. auratus were significantly larger in no-take areas compared to partially-protected areas in the marine park and sites outside the marine park. This study demonstrates how the implementation of the marine park and the protection afforded by no-take and partially-protected areas provides refuge for this important fishery targeted species.

Land Cover and Land Use Change in the US Prairie Pothole Region Using the USDA Cropland Data Layer	LAND												The Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) is a biotically important region of grassland, wetland, and cropland that traverses the Canada-US border. Significant amounts of grasslands and wetlands within the PPR have been converted to croplands in recent years due to increasing demand for biofuels. We characterized land dynamics across the US portion of the PPR (US-PPR) using the USDA Crop Data Layer (CDL) for 2006-2018. We also conducted a comparative analysis between two epochs (1998-2007 & 2008-2017) of the CDL data time series in the North Dakotan portion of the US-PPR. The CDL revealed the western parts of the US-PPR have been dominated by grass/pasture, to the north it was spring wheat, to the east and southern half, soybeans dominated, and to the south it was corn (maize). Nonparametric trend analysis on the major crop and land cover types revealed statistically significant net decreases in the grass/pasture class between 2006 and 2018, which accounts for more than a quarter of grass/pasture area within the US-PPR. Other crops experiencing significant decreases included sunflower (-5%), winter wheat (-3%), spring wheat (-2%), and durum wheat (-1%). The combined coverage of corn and soybeans exhibited significant net increases in 23.5% of its cover; whereas, the individual significant net increases were 5% for corn and 11% for soybeans. Hotspots of increase in corn and soybeans were distributed across North and South Dakota. Other crop/land covers with huge significant increases include other hay/non-alfalfa (15%), and alfalfa (11%), which appear to be associated with the sharp increase in larger dairy operations, mostly in Minnesota. Wetland area increased 5% in the US-PPR, due to increased precipitation as well as inundation associated with Devils Lake in North Dakota. Hotspots of decreasing grass/pasture area were evident across the study area. Comparative trend analysis of two epochs (1998-2007 vs. 2008-2017) in North Dakota revealed that grass/pasture cover showed a negligible net trend (-0.3 %) between 1998 and 2007; whereas, there was a statistically significant decrease of more than 30% between 2008 and 2017. Combined coverage of corn and soybeans experienced statistically significant net increases in both epochs: 11% greater during 1998-2007 and 17% greater during 2008-2017. Recent sharp losses of grasslands and smaller wetlands combined the expansion of corn, soybeans, and alfalfa bode ill for wildlife habitat and require a re-examination of agricultural and energy policies that have encouraged these land transitions.

Starting from the late 1970s the P load has been gradually reduced, so that total phosphorus in-lake concentration is now below 10 mu g 1(-1) at winter mixing, compared to a maximum value of 30 mu g 1(-1) in 1978. Nearly two decades after the start of this reversal in trophic conditions, long-term analyses become fruitful, not least because of a scarcity of published long-term data on lake re-oligotrophication, and consequently of agreed predictions on specific points. This paper presents such an analysis, regarding some phytoplankton characteristics (numbers, biovolume, cell size, chlorophyll a, species richness and composition) and their mutual relations in the time series 1981-1995, as well as recent primary production compared with early observations. Notwithstanding phosphorus reduction, the phytoplankton remained quite stable for many years. Only after 1987, when TP concentration fell to about 15 mu g 1(-1) at mixing, definite changes in species diversity and composition appeared. At the same time, average cell size decreased abruptly and persistently, together with chlorophyll and total biovolume while cell numbers were unchanged or rising. Annual primary production was halved in comparison to a past reference period and the efficiency of the photosynthetic process was apparently enhanced.

J	CAMPBELL, JM; HAASE, BL				CAMPBELL, JM; HAASE, BL			AVAILABILITY OF SUITABLE PHYTOPLANKTONIC FOOD FOR ZOOPLANKTON IN AN ICE-COVERED LAKE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Edible phytoplankters were found throughout the winter in a shallow ice-covered lake in Pennsylvania, USA, in conjunction with a diverse population of zooplankton. Environmental conditions during the winter seemed to elimate large and nonmotile types of algae in favor of the smaller motile forms which may be the best foods for zooplankters. The phytoplankton were classified for study by systematic position and by size group. The total volume of phytoplankton comprising the group Chrysophyta and algae .gtoreq. 80 .mu. declined rapidly during the period of ice-cover, while algae .ltoreq. 15 .mu. and Chlorophyta maintained more stable volumes. During the latter weeks of ice-cover phytoplankton densities were low (50-200/ml) and bacteria, detritus or .mu.-algae (.ltoreq. 2 .mu.) not detected by the counting methods used may have been important foods for the zooplankters. The lack of suitable phytoplanktonic foods may have contributed to the decline of calanoid copepods during the late winter.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1981	79	2					113	119		10.1007/BF00006117	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006117													WOS:A1981LP99000002
J	HENAULT, M; FORTIN, R				HENAULT, M; FORTIN, R			STATUS OF THE SPRING SPAWNING CISCO POPULATION (COREGONUS SP) AT LAC DES ECORCES	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												Spring spawning is very rare in the genus Coregonus. Outside of the Great Lakes, it is known in Canada only in Lake des Ecorces (Quebec), for a population possibly linked to the Coregonus artedi complex. This population is distinguished from other local stocks by differences in meristic and morphometric characters, including a marked difference in the number of gill rakers. The abundance of the population seems to have remained the same since its discovery in 1981. However, Lake des Ecorces has been undergoing rapid eutrophication during the past twenty years, and general conditions will deteriorate if no action is taken. Spawning takes place in deep water, hence the sensitivity of the eggs to oxygen depletion and increased sedimentation. The Lake Cisco is a species which is generally vulnerable to predation and to the deterioration of the quality of its habitat. Based on these observations and on the uniqueness of the population it appears that the Spring Cisco of Lake des Ecorces is a vulnerable population in Canada.																			0008-3550					OCT-DEC	1993	107	4					402	409																WOS:A1993PG41500002

As a consequence, model predictions of regional methane emissions based on field campaigns from short eddy covariance towers or static chambers have large uncertainties, because measurements focused on a particular known source of methane emission will be biased compared to regional estimates with regards to magnitude, spatial scale, or frequency of these emissions. Given the relatively large importance of predicting future terrestrial methane fluxes for constraining future atmospheric methane growth rates, a clear need exists to reduce spatiotemporal uncertainties. In 2010, an Ameriflux tower (US-PFa) near Park Falls, WI, USA, was instrumented with closed-path methane flux measurements at 122 m above ground in a mixed wetland-upland landscape representative of the Great Lakes region. Two years of flux observations revealed an average annual methane (CH4) efflux of 785 +/- 75 mg C-CH4 m(-2) yr(-1), compared to a mean CO2 sink of -80g C-CO2 m(-2) yr(-1), a ratio of 1% in magnitude on a mole basis. Interannual variability in methane flux was 30% of the mean flux and driven by suppression of methane emissions during dry conditions in late summer 2012. Though relatively small, the magnitude of the methane source from the very tall tower measurements was mostly within the range previously measured using static chambers at nearby wetlands, but larger than a simple scaling of those fluxes to the tower footprint. Seasonal patterns in methane fluxes were similar to those simulated in the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM), but magnitude depends on model parameterization and input data, especially regarding wetland extent. The model was unable to simulate short-term (sub-weekly) variability. Temperature was found to be a stronger driver of regional CH4 flux than moisture availability or net ecosystem production at the daily to monthly scale.

PHYTOPLANKTON AND NUTRIENTS	ESTUARINE AND COASTAL MARINE SCIENCE												Nutrient levels, plant pigments, O2 balance and phytoplankton populations were studied for 2 yr in a brackish-water lagoon. The lagoon was supplied with abundant nutrients for plant growth by its freshwater inflow stream. Being shallow, it was frequently eutrophic in summer. The number of phytoplankton species found in the pool was low, but several species showed marked continuity over the study period. Phytoplankton diversity was low, as often found in eutrophic lakes, and on occasions extremely low owing to the dominance of Gyrodinium resplendens. This species formed dense blooms which showed uneven horizontal and vertical distributions. In early summer, G. resplendens accumulated in strongly stratified layers of water about 1.5 m below the surface and caused maxima of O2 and O2 production at this level. Over the period of study some marked changes of species composition occurred, but these did not conform to any clear seasonal pattern such as that typical of many temperate freshwater lakes.

J	Schofield, CL; Keleher, C				Schofield, CL; Keleher, C			Comparison of brook trout reproductive success and recruitment in an acidic Adirondack lake following whole lake liming and watershed liming	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Limestone applications to the catchment of one tributary to Woods Lake were highly effective in reducing stream acidity and stabilizing seasonal fluctuations in pH. The resulting improvement in stream water quality also led to a dramatic shift in reproductive strategy of the Woods Lake brook trout population. Prior to catchment liming, brook trout in Woods Lake were restricted to spawning on poor quality near shore substrate with limited ground water seepage. Reproductive success was limited by high mortality of eggs and larvae and recruitment from in lake spawning was not successful. Spawning brook trout did not utilize the tributary for spawning prior to watershed liming. Mitigation of acidity in the tributary, by catchment liming, effectively extended the spawning habitat available to the Woods Lake brook trout population and one year following treatment brook trout spawned successfully in the tributary for the first time in 6 years of observation. Significant recruitment of young trout into the lake population occurred from 1991 through 1993, although the absolute number of fish captured was relatively small. In the fall of 1993, four year classes of naturally spawned brook trout were present in the lake. Although reproductive success was enhanced by improving tributary spawning habitat in the Woods Lake basin, self maintenance of the population may be limited by low recruitment rates of young trout, due to high levels of summer mortality resulting from predation. Mitigation of this constraint would require substantially higher levels of fry production than were observed in Woods Lake and/or enhanced refugia for young trout. The results of this experiment suggest that re-establishment of tributary spawning populations of brook trout may be possible, with future reductions in acidic deposition, in acidic Adirondack lakes with limited in-lake spawning habitat.																			0168-2563	1573-515X				MAR	1996	32	3					323	337		10.1007/BF02187144	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02187144													WOS:A1996UT83000008

France, was contaminated by radionuclides after the Chernobyl accident in the first days of May 1986. Sediments from a small mountain lake in this area were collected, as well as forest soils in its vicinity, in order to obtain Cs-137 and Pb-210 profiles. Calculated from the Pb-210 inventory in a soil of a horizontal area, the flux is high in the area (0.06 Bq cm(-2) y(-1)) probably because of the great frequency of rain and uranium ores outcropping in the massif. The comparison of the Cs-137 Soil inventories and the unsupported Pb-210 suggests that the 137Cs fallout due to the Chernobyl accident in the study site (Boreon) was at least 3.5 Bq cm(-2), more probably the double. The recent lake sediments still undergo a rather strong contamination by Cs-137 and the sediment profiles show that the residence time of Cs-137 in the catchment area is long. The study area is frequented by many inhabitants of the city of Nice and other cities at the Mediterranean coast during week-end and during summer and winter holidays. Thus the Cs-137 external exposure impact was evaluated at 2 mSv y(-1) for 2002 in the most contaminated point, (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Lynn, DE; Waldren, S				Lynn, DE; Waldren, S			Survival of Ranunculus repens L. (creeping buttercup) in an amphibious habitat	ANNALS OF BOTANY												The turlough form of Ranunculus repens is subjected to several months' complete inundation with hard groundwater. Experimental flooding to the level of the soil surface had no effect on tLirlough or ruderal populations relative to drained controls. Experimental submergence resulted in direct tissue death of the ruderal population but did not affect the turlough population relative to drained controls. There was no detectable difference in the proportion of aerenchyma in drained, flooded and submerged roots of plants from either population. The proportion of aerenchyma increased with root age in the ruderal population. Up to twice the proportion of aerenchyma occurred in the lower third of the root in the turlough population relative to the middle and upper thirds. Submergence in artificially hardened tap water increased the amount of tissue death in the ruderal population, whereas it appeared to enhance the growth of plants from the turlough population relative to that of plants submerged in tap water. Only the ruderal population demonstrated a depth accommodation response in submerged conditions. Root concentrations of ethanol-soluble carbohydrates were up to three times higher in a field-collected turlough population during winter and autumn months than those in a ruderal population. Low levels of ethanol-insoluble carbohydrates were present in the turlough population but were absent from the ruderal population. Starch concentrations fluctuated greatly in the turlough population and were generally higher than those in the ruderal population. These results, together with those from previous investigations, suggest that the turlough population survives prolonged submergence by maintaining low levels of submerged photosynthesis, which may circulate oxygen within the plant tissues, and by utilizing storage carbohydrates for maintenance respiration.

Vegetation in western Central Mexico during the last 50 000 years: modern analogs and climate in the Zacapu Basin	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												The late glacial and the transition towards the Holocene marked a period of significant environmental change at a global scale. In western Central Mexico, few records span beyond the Holocene, and little is known about Pleistocene climatic and environmental variability. Here we report on the pollen record of a composite sequence made of three cores that cover the last 50 ka (thousands of calibrated radiocarbon years before present) in the Zacapu Basin, western Central Mexico (similar to 1970?m asl). The conjunction of modern pollen rain from the area with the composite fossil pollen sequence from cores Cantabria, Cantabria 1 and CEMCA Point-1 provided a detailed history of the vegetation of the area. Recognition of modern environmental patterns through individual modern pollen taxa proved difficult, but multivariate analysis separated different vegetation types. No-modern-analog communities relative to the modern vegetation cover of the area were evident, especially during periods of drought. Apparently, summer precipitation was significant before 40 ka and after the deglaciation. However, this moisture source declined from similar to 40 to 10 ka because tradewinds from the Gulf of Mexico were blocked by the eastern mountains of Central Mexico as a result of lower temperatures. By contrast, westerly and northerly winds were enhanced by maximum ice cover from similar to 19 to 17 ka, providing abundant winter precipitation and therefore preventing extreme drought in the area.

Dynamics of the intertropical convergence zone over the western Pacific during the Little Ice Age	NATURE GEOSCIENCE												Precipitation in low latitudes is primarily controlled by the position of the intertropical convergence zone, which migrates from south to north seasonally. The Little Ice Age (defined as AD 1400-1850) was associated with low solar irradiance and high atmospheric aerosol concentrations as a result of several large volcanic eruptions. The mean position of the intertropical convergence zone over the western Pacific has been proposed to have shifted southwards during this interval, which would lead to relatively dry Little Ice Age conditions in the northern extent of the intertropical convergence zone and wet conditions around its southern limit. However, here we present a synthesis of palaeo-hydrology records from the Asian-Australian monsoon area that documents a rainfall distribution that distinctly violates the expected pattern. Our synthesis instead documents a synchronous retreat of the East Asian Summer Monsoon and the Australian Summer Monsoon into the tropics during the Little Ice Age, a pattern supported by the results of our climate model simulation of tropical precipitation over the past millennium. We suggest that this pattern over the western Pacific is best explained by a contraction in the latitudinal range over which the intertropical convergence zone seasonally migrates during the Little Ice Age. We therefore propose that rather than a strict north-south migration, the intertropical convergence zone in this region may instead expand and contract over decadal to centennial timescales in response to external forcing.

Reconstructing warm-season temperatures using brGDGTs and assessing biases in Holocene temperature records in northern Fennoscandia	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Understanding Holocene climate variability is crucial for predicting future climate change, which will disproportionally affect high-latitude regions. Summer temperature (T-summer) reconstructions in regions such as northern Finland are mainly derived from microfossil data. We reconstructed T-summer spanning the interval 10-1 cal ka BP using branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) from lake-sediment record from Lake Annan Juomusjarvi (AJU) in northern Finland. The reconstruction shows cool early Holocene conditions, similar to 2 degrees C below the long-term mean (defined by the last 8.5 kyr), followed by persistent warming to a thermal maximum around similar to 7.0 cal ka BP, a relatively stable climate (similar to 0.5 degrees C above the long-term mean) from 7.0 to 3.5 cal ka BP, and then a long-term cooling trend (-0.1 degrees C center dot kyr(-1)) since 3.5 cal ka BP. This temperature history is remarkably well replicated by the nearby pollen-T-July reconstruction from Lake Loitsana. However, Lake Loitsana chironomid and macrofossil data argue for a much earlier thermal maximum at similar to 10 cal ka BP. Comparison of chironomid versus pollen records from across northern Fennoscandia confirms this inter-proxy discrepancy on the timing of Holocene peak warmth is a regional-scale phenomenon. Previous studies had raised the possibility that non-climatic noise in certain pollen records, due to local-scale overrepresentation of certain pollen types in the early and mid Holocene, may be contributing to an artificial lag in the thermal maximum. However, brGDGTs are unaffected by terrestrial flora and corroborate a mid-Holocene thermal maximum, which challenges the notion that pollen records are generally prone to misrepresenting the early to mid-Holocene climate history. Alternatively, proxy-specific environmental or mean seasonality biases may explain inter-proxy discrepancies in the timing of peak warmth. Continued diversification of the proxy network will help to better understand inter-proxy differences and refine knowledge of Holocene climate in northern Fennoscandia.

J	Labecka, AM; Domagala, J				Labecka, Anna Maria; Domagala, Jozef			Two pathways for spermatogenesis in Sinanodonta woodiana (Lea, 1834) (Bivalvia: Unionidae)	JOURNAL OF MOLLUSCAN STUDIES												The Chinese pond mussel, Sinanodonta woodiana, an invasive species indigenous to Asia, naturally colonizes new locations as a glochidium that parasitizes fish. Human activity has facilitated a continental-scale spread of S. woodiana in Europe, where it is found in artificial reservoirs and has begun to invade natural habitats. This study aimed to investigate the reproductive activity of males in a female-biased population of S. woodiana that lives in a riverine channel linked to a power plant with a cooling water system in NW Poland. Cells formed during spermatogenesis and morphological changes in reproductive follicles (acini) were analysed over a 2-year period using light microscopy. Typical and atypical spermatogenic pathways were identified. The atypical spermatozoa were released from multinucleated cysts and had significantly shorter heads than typical spermatozoa. Spermatozoa formed in the typical way occurred consistently in all months over the study period, while the atypical spermatozoa were recorded occasionally in the first year of the study and more frequently in the second study. The highest proportion of males with spent gonads was found in late summer and early autumn. Our data show that mussels produce spermatozoa year-round, but that the levels of typical and atypical spermatogenesis varied. The two pathways of spermatogenesis in S. woodiana provide an important insight into potential mechanisms underlying the evolution of doubly uniparental inheritance of mitochondrial DNA, a phenomenon observed in S. woodiana. Additionally, a detailed understanding of the reproductive cycle of this non-native species can help to understand its reproductive potential and predict the likely direction of population change in a newly colonized area. The breeding population of S. woodiana studied by us inhabits a tributary of the Odra River, one of Poland's largest rivers, and thus poses a threat to the natural environment. Riverine habitats like our study site are local heat islands and the mussels reproducing in them over time may colonize natural waters and expand the range of their distribution.

The South Mono eruption occurred in 594-648cal A.D., and its products consist of widespread Plinian and phreatomagmatic fall, surge and pyroclastic flow deposits. The explosive deposits can be broken into Basal, Orange-Brown (surge dominated) and Upper subunits. The eruptive phase represented by the Upper beds was the most intense and voluminous, dispersing tephra over a wide region of eastern CA and western NV. South Coulee was the only effusive product of the eruption, and comprises the vast majority of the c. 0.4 Cu km dense-rock equivalent (DRE) volume. The tephra overlies the deposits of Wilson Butte to the south, and is correlated herein with Wood's Tephra 2, and Walker Lake and Turupah Flats regional marker tephra layers. Other dates for these regional tephras may be the result of dating ash redeposited in debris flow events following fire. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Population dynamics and diversity of viruses, bacteria and phytoplankton in a shallow eutrophic lake	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												We have studied the temporal variation in viral abundances and community assemblage in the eutrophic Lake Loosdrecht through epifluorescence microscopy and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The virioplankton community was a dynamic component of the aquatic community, with abundances ranging between 5.5 x 10(7) and 1.3 x 10(8) virus-like particles ml(-1) and viral genome sizes ranging between 30 and 200 kb. Both viral abundances and community composition followed a distinct seasonal cycle, with high viral abundances observed during spring and summer. Due to the selective and parasitic nature of viral infection, it was expected that viral and host community dynamics would covary both in abundances and community composition. The temporal dynamics of the bacterial and cyanobacterial communities, as potential viral hosts, were studied in addition to a range of environmental parameters to relate these to viral community dynamics. Cyanobacterial and bacterial communities were studied applying epifluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Both bacterial and cyanobacterial communities followed a clear seasonal cycle. Contrary to expectations, viral abundances were neither correlated to abundances of the most dominant plankton groups in Lake Loosdrecht, the bacteria and the filamentous cyanobacteria, nor could we detect a correlation between the assemblage of viral and bacterial or cyanobacterial communities during the overall period. Only during short periods of strong fluctuations in microbial communities could we detect viral community assemblages to covary with cyanobacterial and bacterial communities. Methods with a higher specificity and resolution are probably needed to detect the more subtle virus-host interactions. Viral abundances did however relate to cyanobacterial community assemblage and showed a significant positive correlation to Chl-a as well as prochlorophytes, suggesting that a significant proportion of the viruses in Lake Loosdrecht may be phytoplankton and more specific cyanobacterial viruses. Temporal changes in bacterial abundances were significantly related to viral community assemblage, and vice versa, suggesting an interaction between viral and bacterial communities in Lake Loosdrecht.					; Laanbroek, Hendrikus/AAV-9215-2020; Simis, Stefan/B-1703-2008	Simis, Stefan/0000-0002-6296-9146; Laanbroek, Hendrikus/0000-0003-2400-3399													0095-3628					JUL	2008	56	1					29	42		10.1007/s00248-007-9321-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-007-9321-3								17924158					WOS:000256472700004

The impact of physico-chemical characteristics on bacterial structures was investigated through multivariate analysis. Samples were collected from 4 sampling stations along the Upper Vaal River during winter (June 2009) and summer (December 2010). Physico-chemical analysis was conducted on-site. Additional physico-chemical data were obtained from statutory bodies. DNA was directly isolated from water samples and PCR amplified using universal bacterial primer pairs. PCR products were subjected to DGGE fingerprinting and high-throughput sequencing, followed by Shannon-Weaver diversity calculations, cluster analysis and multivariate analysis. Physico-chemical parameters did not exceed the prescribed South African water quality standards for domestic use, aquatic ecosystems, livestock watering and irrigation. DGGE banding patterns revealed similar bacterial community structures for 3 of the 4 sampling stations. PCA and RDA indicated that pH, water temperature and inorganic nutrient concentrations could be used to explain changes in bacterial community structures. High-throughput sequencing data showed that bacterial assemblages were dominated by common freshwater groups: Cyanobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. Other freshwater phyla such as Deltaproteobacteria, Epsilonbacteria, Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Flavobacteria and Fibrobacteres were found in low proportions. This study provides an overview of the dominant bacterial groups in the Upper Vaal River and the impact of environmental changes on bacterial diversity.

Globally, freshwater ecosystems are warming at unprecedented rates and northern temperate lakes are simultaneously experiencing increased runoff of humic substances (brownification), with little known consequences for future conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. 2. We employed an outdoor mesocosm experiment during spring and summer to investigate the combined effects of gradually increasing warming and brownification perturbations on the phytoplankton community structure (biodiversity and composition) and functioning (biomass). 3. While we did not observe overall significant treatment effects on total phytoplankton biomasses, we show that predicted increases in warming and brownification can reduce biodiversity considerably, occasionally up to 90% of Shannon diversity estimates. Our results demonstrate that the loss of biodiversity is driven by the dominance of mixotrophic algae (Dinobryon and Cryptomonas), whereas several other phytoplankton taxa may be temporarily displaced from the community, including Cyclotella, Desmodesmus, Monoraphidium, Tetraedron, Nitzschia and Golenkinia. 4. The observed loss of biodiversity coincided with an increase in bacterial production providing resources for potential mixotrophs along the gradient of warming and brownification. This coupling between bacterial production and mixotrophs was likely a major cause behind the competitive displacement of obligate phototrophs and supports evidence for the importance of consumer-prey dynamics in shaping environmental impacts on phytoplankton communities. 5. We conclude that warming and brownification are likely to cause a profound loss of biodiversity by indirectly affecting competitive interactions among phytoplankton taxa. Importantly, our results did not show an abrupt loss of biodiversity; instead the reduction in taxa richness levelled off after exceeding a threshold of warming and brownification. These results exemplify the complex nonlinear responses of biodiversity to environmental perturbations and provide further insights for predicting biodiversity patterns to the future warming and brownification of freshwaters.

Specifically, small-scale experiments and current spatial distribution patterns suggested that this species is more abundant when lake mixing depths are shallower, but a direct test of this hypothesis at the whole-lake scale was lacking. We conducted a whole-lake mixing manipulation in a remote arctic lake that normally has relatively shallow thermal stratification and abundant D. stelligera populations during the summer. We employed a "Before-After-Control-Impact" design using an experimental lake and a control lake. Lake thermal structure and diatom populations were monitored in both lakes in summer 2013 without manipulating either lake, and again in summer 2014 when the experimental lake was manipulated to achieve deeper mixing depths. The abundance of D. stelligera declined during the manipulated period of deeper mixing in 2014, while it increased during the same time frame in the control lake. The same pattern was not observed for the four other diatom taxa found in both lakes in both years. Our results confirm the use of D. stelligera as an indicator of changing lake thermal structure, and suggest that the broader application of this tool to lake sediment records will yield greater insight into longer-term variability in the response of lake ecosystems to climate.

To investigate the characteristics of endogenous nitrogen and phosphorus release from urban rivers, the Yitong River, an urban river in northern China, was used as an experimental object. Eight sampling sites were set up in the upstream, urban, and downstream regions of an urban section. The nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient exchange fluxes at the sediment-water interface of the Yitong River were assessed by analyzing the sediment and overlying water, and the effects of environmental factors on nitrogen and phosphorus release were investigated using static release experiments. The results showed that the diffusive fluxes of endogenous total nitrogen (TN), ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), and total phosphorus (TP) in the urban section of the Yitong River ranged from -1.571 to 19.365 mg center dot(m(2)center dot d)(-1), -0.171 to 9.227 mg center dot(m(2)center dot d)(-1), and -0.052 to 0.595 mg center dot(m(2)center dot d)(-1), respectively. The diffusive fluxes of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients were all greater under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic conditions. The diffusive fluxes of nitrogen and phosphorus were influenced by changes in pH, DO, and temperature of the overlying water, and the release of phosphorus from the sediment was accelerated by high temperatures in the range of 5-25 degrees C. Acidic conditions favored the release of TN, whereas alkaline conditions favored the release of TP from the sediment. Furthermore, during the control of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution, it should be noted that fluxes are higher in spring and autumn. Thus, when appropriate techniques should be implemented to achieve better control. These findings are intended to provide a reference for the study of nitrogen and phosphorus diffusion fluxes at the sediment-water interface in urban rivers and other surface waters around the world.					zhao, ke/NRA-9166-2025															2071-1050				JAN	2023	15	2							1210	10.3390/su15021210	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15021210													WOS:000915670700001

Terrestrial export of highly bioavailable carbon from small boreal catchments in spring floods	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. We assessed the terrestrial export of organic carbon, which effectively supported aquatic bacterial production (BP), from small boreal catchments during spring flood. We analysed stream runoff from nine small catchments with different proportions of peat mires and coniferous forests by monitoring the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) flux in combination with conducting bacterial bioassays. 2. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that BP during 7-day-dark bioassays (BP7; mu g C L(-1)day(-1)) was explained by both the quantity and quality (low-molecular weight fractions) of the DOC. BP7 can be used as a measure of export of terrestrial organic carbon that is highly bioavailable. 3. Total export of DOC during spring flood from the different catchments ranged from 20 to 27 kg ha(-1) and was negatively correlated to forest cover (%). However, the export of BP7 carbon was positively correlated to forest cover and varied from about 0.1 kg ha(-1) in mire-dominated streams to about 0.2 kg ha(-1) in forest-dominated streams. 4. The high bioavailability of forest carbon suggests that forests are the main contributors of BP-supporting carbon in boreal streams although mires have higher area-specific export of DOC.

J	Zhang, X; Li, YH; Ren, SY; Zhang, XF				Zhang, Xu; Li, Yanhong; Ren, Siyuan; Zhang, Xiaofen			papers Soil CO2 emissions and water level response in an arid zone lake wetland under freeze-thaw action	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Freezing and thawing profoundly affect soil carbon cycling. Under the influence of climate change, rising temperatures and glacier shrinkage in arid regions have increased the spring river supply to lakes. However, intense evaporation in summer and seasonal fluctuations in lake water levels alter the magnitude and direction of carbon emissions. Yet, the mechanisms of temperature and groundwater level factors on arid zone lake wetlands remain unclear. This study, through field monitoring, found that during soil freezing periods, Phragmites reduced emissions by 95.21% and increased emissions by 3.91% during thawing periods. Tamarix Chinensis and bare land exhibited a decrease in carbon uptake of 42.77% and 85.25% during soil freezing periods, and a decrease in carbon uptake of 41.98% and 2.17% during thawing periods. By constructing a freeze-thaw simulation device, we simulated CO2 emissions characteristics under different water level conditions during freeze-thaw processes, including water injection at 10 cm, 20 cm, 30 cm, 40 cm (corresponding to water levels 40 cm, 30 cm, 20 cm, 10 cm below the soil surface), as well as scenarios of anhydrous and flooding periods. The results showed that under freeze-thaw conditions, Phragmites exhibited the strongest carbon uptake when water was injected at 20 cm, transitioning from emissions during the anhydrous period to carbon uptake. Tamarix Chinensis exhibited the strongest carbon uptake during freeze-thaw cycles when water was injected at 10 cm, showing a 93.69% increase compared to the anhydrous period. Meanwhile, the bare land exhibited the strongest carbon uptake during freeze-thaw cycles in the no water period. Lower temperatures and higher water levels favor increased carbon uptake in lake wetlands. This study identifies optimal water levels for carbon uptake in lake wetlands during freeze-thaw, and the important role of water level and temperature conditions on carbon emissions, providing valuable insights for assessing the carbon feedback mechanisms in lake wetlands under future climate change.

We review the evidence for climatic change that demonstrates the historical importance of extremes in north-south differences in summer temperatures and east-west differences in aridity across four large subregions. These physical driving forces alter density stratification, deoxygenation, decomposition and salinity. Biotic community composition and associated ecosystem processes of productivity and nutrient cycling respond rapidly to these climatically driven dynamics. Ecosystem processes also respond to cultural effects such as dams and diversions of water for irrigation, waste dilution and urban demands for drinking water and industrial uses. Distinguishing climatic from cultural effects in future models of aquatic ecosystem functioning will require more refinement in both climatic and economic forecasting. There is a need, for example, to predict how long-term climatic forecasts (based on both ENSO and global warming simulations) relate to the permanence and productivity of shallow water ecosystems. Aquatic ecologists, hydrologists, climatologists and geographers have much to discuss regarding the synthesis of available data and the design of future interdisciplinary research.

J	Feng, JW; Liu, HZ; Sun, JH; Wang, L				Feng, Jian Wu; Liu, Hui Zhi; Sun, Ji Hua; Wang, Lei			The surface energy budget and interannual variation of the annual total evaporation over a highland lake in Southwest China	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												The turbulence spectra and energy budget were investigated based on eddy covariance method over an open-water highland lake (Erhai Lake) in Southwest China. We estimated the annual total evaporation and CO2 emission from the lake, and the evaporation trend in the past few decades was also discussed. Due to the large thermal inertia of lake water, the surface water temperature lagged behind the air temperature. Maximum lake-air temperature difference of about 4 A degrees C had been observed in November. Water temperature profile measurements revealed that the stratification of lake water was not evident throughout the year. The spectra and cospectra of wind speed and temperature roughly satisfied the -2/3 and -4/3 rule in inertial subrange, respectively. The w spectra were observed to have a larger contribution from higher frequencies than other variables. Obvious shifts of spectra and cospectra peaks toward higher frequencies were observed as the atmospheric stratification became more stable. The lake acted as a heat sink from March through June and quickly released heat into the atmosphere from September through December. Average energy balance closure for the lake was about 80 % in 2012. The lake majorly acted as a source of CO2 to the atmosphere, but weak sinks of CO2 were observed in the summer and early fall. The total annual emission of CO2 was estimated to be 333.28 g C m(-2) year(-1). The annual evaporation over the lake decreased due to the increased amount of low cloud and precipitation, with the lower annual evaporation in the 1990s compared to that in the 1980s.

J	Hammerschmidt, CR; Fitzgerald, WF				Hammerschmidt, Chad R.; Fitzgerald, William F.			Sediment-water exchange of methylmercury determined from shipboard benthic flux chambers	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Benthic mobilization is an important pathway by which organisms in aquatic systems may be exposed to monomethylmercury (MMHg) produced in sediments. We have developed a shipboard method for measuring MMHg effluxes from undisturbed sediment cores. This approach was used at multiple locations in a temperate coastal system, New York/New Jersey Harbor, during summer (August 2003) and winter conditions (February 2004). MMHg fluxes at the sediment-water interface were determined with shipboard benthic flux chambers (SBFCs), an intact core of sediment and overlying water that is stirred inductively and incubated under it? situ conditions. For all locations and each period, sediments were a net source of MMHg; levels in water overlying sediments increased as a linear function of incubation time, and associated fluxes varied less than 10% relative standard error among replicate chambers with sediment from the same sampling location and period. Seasonality was evident with measured MMHg fluxes (pmol m(-2) d(-1)) ranging from 39 to 55 among locations in February and 71-92 in August. Fluxes determined with the SBFCs were compared with diffusional effluxes estimated from gradients of MMHg in pore water of the same sediments (SBFC:diffusional flux ratio). SBFC:diffusional flux ratios ranged from 0.9 to 1.4 in August and 2.3-4.3 in February. SBFC: diffusional flux ratios, which correlate positively with dissolved oxygen (DO) in bottom waters, suggest that MMHg mobilization is largely diffusional when DO is less than about 80% saturation and enhanced at greater levels. Further, increased MMHg fluxes are likely due to increased bioirrigation. This is consistent with the observed positive relationship between macrofauna abundance and DO. Thus, benthic MMHg fluxes, which are enhanced relative to diffusion when DO in bottom waters is near saturation, may be linked to increased abundance and/or activity of infauna that irrigate sediment. Improving oxygen conditions, therefore, could increase sediment-water effluxes of MMHg in NY/NJ Harbor and comparable coastal marine systems. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Cortés, A; MacIntyre, S				Cortes, Alicia; MacIntyre, Sally			Mixing processes in small arctic lakes during spring	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Small ice-covered lakes are stratified by temperature and solutes. Using time series measurements and profiles of temperature, specific conductance (SC), and dissolved oxygen obtained during spring 2014 and 2015, we identified the physical processes occurring under the ice and at ice-off in two similar to 2 ha, 10-m-deep arctic lakes. The lakes are distinguished from other freshwater, ice-covered lakes by solutes initially stabilizing the density stratification when temperature decreased in the lower water column and, with one exception, stabilizing it during warming. With an ice cover 1 m thick, wind-forced internal waves occurred, with 2nd vertical mode waves prevalent where stratification was weak. Snowmelt induced near-surface chemical stratification such that diurnal thermoclines formed with stable temperature stratification in a similar to 4-m-thick layer. Horizontal exchange was mediated by internal waves and gravity currents induced by greater heating near shore and as incoming snowmelt displaced water in shallow regions. Toward ice-off, the gravity currents reduced temperature stratification between the snowmelt-induced near-surface pycnocline and the bottom pycnocline but slight increases in SC precluded radiatively driven convection. Snowmelt retention was greater with rapid spring heating. The lakes did not mix by ice-off. With moderate winds, Wedderburn numbers decreased below 3 at ice-off, and the near-surface pycnocline upwelled and then deepened due to internal wave-induced mixing. The concomitant downward mixing of heat caused a rapid onset of thermal stratification, and that, combined with incomplete mixing under the ice, led to persistence of near-bottom depletion in oxygen and increased density and dissolved solutes.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				FEB	2020	65	2					260	288		10.1002/lno.11296	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11296		AUG 2019											WOS:000482567700001
J	Lora, JM; Ibarra, DE				Lora, Juan M.; Ibarra, Daniel E.			The North American hydrologic cycle through the last deglaciation	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												While the climate evolution of North America during the last deglaciation has received considerable attention, few detailed model-data comparisons of the deglacial hydroclimate have been conducted at the continental scale. Here we use a transient climate simulation of the last deglaciation and a synthesis of hydroclimate proxies from across the continent to broadly assess the moisture budget and its evolution, including the primary components and mechanisms for changes, and evaluate the level of agreement between model and data in order to inform areas of major discrepancy for attention in future work. At the broadest scale, the simulation indicates that North America was wetter than modern through much of the last deglaciation, with the exception of the Pacific Northwest. This was principally due to increased moisture convergence by the mean flow over the west of the continent, and by transient eddies over the east. We find that the simulation demonstrates considerable skill in comparison to proxy records in the coastal Southwest and Pacific Northwest, with limited success in other regions. The highest disagreement occurs in the North-central region, where the model and data disagree on the sign of changes. In addition, we find that the areas of agreement coincide with regions whose hydroclimate is dominated by winter precipitation, while regions of disagreement are those where summer precipitation is predominant, and where the model suggests dynamical changes are important. These results illustrate the impact of the ice sheet on the atmospheric dynamics, and therefore the importance of its accurate reconstruction, as well as that of model resolution. Our analysis and synthesis provide context for future transient climate simulations, and suggest numerous areas of priority for future research. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Yi, SH; Saito, Y				Yi, SH; Saito, Y			Latest Pleistocene climate variation of the East Asian monsoon from pollen records of two East China regions	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Pollen analyses performed on borehole cores from the present delta plains of the paleo-Changjiang incised valley and the paleo-Huanghe fluvial, China lead to reconstruction of the latest Pleistocene variation of the East Asian monsoon and permit direct correlation with the vegetation history of eastern China. From 13 000 to 11670 cal yr BP, the short-term climatic deterioration (STCD) possibly corresponding to the Younger Dryas, characterized by cold, dry conditions caused by a strengthened winter monsoon and a weakened summer monsoon, is reflected in the predominance of xerophytic herbaceous pollen (e.g. Arternisia) input, indicative of open grasslands. During the subsequent early post-glacial (PG) interval (11 670-11 270 cal yr BP), pollen of conifer forest-grassland taxa with thermophilous hardwood tree pollen indicate climatic warming (cool, humid conditions). Artemisia/Chenopodiaceae (A/C) ratios reveal that climatic changes led to increased precipitation at the transition between the STCD and the early PG intervals. Moreover, both the phytogeographic differences and the A/C ratios indicate that during the STCD episode, the humidity levels between the paleo-Changjiang incised valley and the paleo-Huanghe fluvial were different, because they were located in different monsoonal zones. Finally, the possible correspondence of the STCD episode to the YD cold event is believed to indicate that the YD is not confined to the Circum-North Atlantic region, but at minimum is a hemispheric climatic event.

T. clavata first appeared at the beginning of the study. Roach were heavily infected by both parasites, whereas the rudd contained very few specimens of either species. A small number of roach-rudd hybrids were examined, and appeared to have a susceptibility intermediate between the parental types. Levels of T. clavata in roach increased throughout the study. This parasite had a life span of .ltoreq. 1 yr in the fish, and was continuously lost from the population. This loss was balanced by a minor infection period in April/May and a major one extending from Aug. until Jan. The fish continued to accumulate infections until they reached a size of about 130 mm, but thereafter intensity fluctuated about the level reached. D. spathaceum infections similarly increased throughout the study period, and there was a suggestion of a wave of infection in the spring. This parasite has a much longer life span, and levels of infection increased with fish size, only falling in the largest, and therefore oldest, hosts. Major changes in parasite populations were reflected to a lesser extent in the rudd. Both species were over-dispersed, but the data from roach was too heterogeneous to fit to any theoretical models, whereas that from the rudd conformed to a negative binomial distribution.																				1095-8649					1978	13	1					19	32		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1978.tb03409.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1978.tb03409.x													WOS:A1978FP27600003

Soil and nutrient retention in winter-flooded ricefields with implications for watershed management	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												The ability of water resources to support aquatic life and human needs depends, in part, on reducing nonpoint source pollution amid contemporary agricultural practices. Winter retention of shallow water on rice and other agricultural fields is an accepted management practice for wildlife conservation; however, soil and water conservation benefits are not well documented. We evaluated the ability of four post-harvest ricefield treatment combinations (stubble-flooded, stubble-open, disked-flooded and disked-open) to abate nonpoint source exports into watersheds of the Mississippi Alluvial Valley. Total suspended solid exports were 1,121 kg ha(-1) (1,000 lb ac(-1)) from disked-open fields where rice stubble was disked after harvest and fields were allowed to drain, compared with 35 kg ha(-1) (31 lb ac(-1)) from stubble-flooded fields where stubble was left standing after harvest and fields captured rainfall front November 1 to March 1. Estimates of total suspended solid exports from ricefields based on Landsat imagery and USDA crop data are 0.43 and 0.40 Mg km(-2) day(-1) in the Big Sunflower and L'Anguille watersheds, respectively. Estimated reductions in total suspended solid exports front ricefields into the Big Sunflower and L'Anguille watersheds range from 26% to 64% under hypothetical scenarios in which 65% to 100% of the rice production area is managed to capture winter rainfall. Winter ricefield management reduced nonpoint source export by decreasing concentrations of solids and nutrients in, and reducing runoff volume from, ricefields in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley.																			0022-4561					MAY-JUN	2009	64	3					173	182		10.2489/jswc.64.3.173	http://dx.doi.org/10.2489/jswc.64.3.173													WOS:000267138100005

Feather mercury concentrations in omnivorous and granivorous terrestrial songbirds in Southeast Michigan	ECOTOXICOLOGY												Sublethal exposure to methylmercury (MeHg) can have consequences for the reproductive, neurological, and physiological health of birds. Songbirds, regardless of trophic position, are often exposed to mercury (Hg) and may be at risk for health effects - especially if they inhabit a place that is subject to high Hg atmospheric deposition and/or have local conditions that are prone to methylation. This study investigates Hg concentrations in terrestrial songbirds of Southeast Michigan, where historical and present-day anthropogenic emissions of heavy metals are elevated. We collected tail feather samples from 223 songbirds across four different species during summer and fall of 2018 and 2019. The mean (+/- SE) Hg concentration across all samples was 103 +/- 3.43 ng/g of dry feather weight. Mercury concentration varied significantly among species, and by age and site in some species, but not by sex. Mean concentrations were nearly seven times higher in two omnivore species, American robin (Turdus migratorius) and European starling (Sturnus vulgaris), than in the two granivore species, American goldfinch (Spinus tristus) and house sparrow (Passer domesticus). Juveniles had higher feather Hg concentrations than adults in all species except American goldfinches - which feed their young primarily seeds, further supporting a role of diet in exposure. We also found a negative correlation between Hg concentration and body condition in American robins, but further research is needed to verify this relationship. While our sample concentrations do not exceed the threshold for sublethal effects, our findings provide insight into the patterns of Hg concentrations in terrestrial songbirds, which may help in understanding Hg exposure pathways, bioaccumulation and risks in terrestrial species.

J	Yeates, PS; Gómez-Giraldo, A; Imberger, J				Yeates, Peter S.; Gomez-Giraldo, Andres; Imberger, Joerg			Observed relationships between microstructure patches and the gradient Richardson number in a thermally stratified lake	ENVIRONMENTAL FLUID MECHANICS												Microstructure profiles of velocity and temperature were collected in Lake Kinneret during the summer months of 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2001 using the Portable Flux Profiler. The profiles were analysed to determine the turbulent properties within statistically homogeneous microstructure patches that were identified in each profile. The nature of the turbulent properties and their distribution is discussed in terms of the dominant forcing mechanisms that exist through the water column. It was found that the properties of binned patch data collapsed reasonably into log-linear functions of the gradient Richardson number with changes in behaviour at and 0.2. For the observations were dominated by boundary turbulence and law-of-the-wall approximations were shown to provide a good description of the observed data near the lake surface. For 0.03 the microstructure appeared to represent turbulence generated primarily by shear instabilities in the interior of the lake that were sampled at various stages of their evolution from the initial stages of development at critical 0.2, where buoyancy frequency and internal shear peak. In terms of the mixing that results from the observed turbulence, both regimes suggest that mixing efficiency falls in a relatively narrow range from 0.07 to 0.16 over the large range 10. For supercritical , shear weakened and turbulence was dominated by strong buoyancy forces so that mixing was suppressed and decreased rapidly toward zero.

In the present work, a novel liquid chromatography electrospray ionization (ESI-MS) tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry method was developed to determine the trace amounts of major microcystin variants in waters. Solid phase extraction (SPE) consuming 10 mL of water samples was used for sample cleaning-up and analyte enrichment. A reverse phase LC separation system consisting a symmetry(300) C-18 column (4.6 mm x 75 mm, i.d., 3.5 mu m, pore size 300 A) and binary gradient methanol-water mobile phase was applied for the separation of microcystin variants (MC-RR, -LR, -LW and -LF). Formic acid was spiked into the mobile phase to enhance the ionization efficiency. Tandem MS/MS analysis was performed in multi-reaction monitoring mode (MRM). Product-ion traces at m/z 519.9 -> 135.0 for MC-RR, 498.4 -> 135.0 for MC-LR, 1025.8 -> 891.7 for MC-LW and 986.8 -> 852.5 for MC-LF was used for quantification of the corresponding microcystin variants, and trace at m/z 556.1 -> 278.0 used for internal standard enkephalin. Limits of quantification (LOQs) were 0.16, 0.04, 2.0, 1.0 and 0.10 mu g/L for MC-RR, MC-LR, MC-LW, MC-LF and enkephalin, respectively. Intra- and inter-day precisions for the determination of the four variants were better than 5 and 6% in relative standard deviations (R.S.D.s), and recoveries for the four variants were in the range of 95-105%. The developed approach has been applied for the determination of the trace amounts of miccocystins in water samples of Taihu Lake of eastern China. The results showed that MC-RR and MC-LR were major variants detected in the water samples, and their concentrations significantly increased with the season changing from Spring to Summer.

Part I: Hydroecological status and trends	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY												Groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs) include valuable ecosystems such as springs, wetlands, rivers, lakes and lagoons. The protection of these systems and services they provide is highlighted by international agreements, i.e. Ramsar convention on wetlands, and regional legislation, i.e. the European Water Framework Directive. Groundwater provides water, nutrients and a relatively stable temperature. However, the role of groundwater in surface ecosystems is not fully understood. The ecosystem can depend on groundwater directly or indirectly, and the reliance can be continuous, seasonal or occasional. This has implications for the vulnerability of ecosystems, as some may be easily affected by external pressure. Conceptual models and quantitative assessments of how groundwater interacts with the environment are needed. GDEs are also threatened by different land use activities and climate change. Hence, we need to understand how GDEs are affected by changes in groundwater quantity and quality, as severe groundwater changes have been observed in many regions. This study examines key aspects of GDEs (hydrogeology, geochemistry and biodiversity) in order to improve conceptual understanding of the role of groundwater in such ecosystems. The status and baseline of different types of GDEs are discussed, with particular emphasis on past evidence of environmental change and potential thresholds and threats in GDEs in various parts of Europe with different land use, climate and geology.

The influence of CO2 level on microcosms was greatest during the spring because of the high growth rate of phytoplankton. In this season, rising CO2 levels caused a pH reduction, and the maximum reduction was 0.6 units when CO2 level was enhanced from the present level to 750 mu atm. The doubling of CO2 level could increase the net primary production (NPP) by 65% during spring when the concentrations of other nutrients were maintained. The rise of NPP could cause a decline of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration, and CO2 enrichment might mitigate the extent of this decline. Meanwhile, higher CO2 may slow or prevent a loss of diversity of phytoplankton in microcosms in this season. During the other three seasons, Microcystis predominated, and the percentage of cyanobacteria did not alter with the change of CO2. We did not observe a significant increase in the abundance of any taxa with the rise of CO2 during the in situ microcosm experiments.					zhang, min/IYI-9869-2023; yang, zhou/JKI-3744-2023														0706-652X	1205-7533				MAY	2016	73	5					727	736		10.1139/cjfas-2015-0151	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2015-0151													WOS:000375425900001
J	Hood, E; McKnight, DM; Williams, MW				Hood, E; McKnight, DM; Williams, MW			Sources and chemical character of dissolved organic carbon across an alpine/subalpine ecotone, Green Lakes Valley, Colorado Front Range, United States	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												We investigated how the source and chemical character of aquatic dissolved organic carbon (DOC) change over the course of the runoff season (May-November, 1999) in Green Lakes Valley, a high-elevation ecosystem in the Front Range of the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Samples were collected on North Boulder Creek from four sites across an alpine/subalpine ecotone in order to understand how the transition from the lightly vegetated alpine to the forested reaches of the catchment influences aquatic DOC. Concentrations of DOC at the four sites peaked between 2.6 and 8.9 mg C L-1 on the ascending limb of the snowmelt hydrograph, with the higher concentrations at the two subalpine sites. Seasonally, the chemical fractionation of DOC showed that there was a large range (29-72%) in the fulvic acid content of DOC at the four sites, with the highest fulvic acid percentages on the ascending limb of the hydrograph. Yields of DOC at the two gauged sites ranged from 10 to 11 kg ha(-1) over the season with between 45 and 50% of the yield occurring as fulvic acid DOC and the remainder as nonhumic material. The fluorescence properties of DOC from all four sites indicated that during peak runoff, DOC was derived primarily from terrestrial precursor material. However, seasonal changes in the fluorescence properties of fulvic acids at the highest elevation sites suggest that DOC derived from algal and microbial biomass in the lakes is a more important source of DOC above tree line during late summer and fall. We hypothesize that much of the autochthonous DOC production is a result of algal growth in alpine lakes. Further, comparison to a forested control catchment suggests that processes in the alpine reach of the catchment may alter both the amount and chemistry of DOC incident to the downstream subalpine aquatic system.

J	Metcalf, JS; Banack, SA; Cox, PA				Metcalf, James S.; Banack, Sandra Anne; Cox, Paul Alan			Cyanotoxin Analysis of Air Samples from the Great Salt Lake	TOXINS												The Great Salt Lake in Utah is the largest saline lake in the Western hemisphere and one of the largest terminal lakes in the world. Situated at the eastern edge of the Great Basin, it is a remnant of the freshwater Lake Bonneville whose water level precipitously lowered about 12,000 years ago due to a natural break in Red Rock pass to the north. It contains a diverse assemblage of cyanobacteria which vary spatially dependent on salinity. In 1984, the waters of the Great Salt Lake occupied 8500 km2. Nearly four decades later, the waters occupy 2500 km2-a reduction in surface area of 71%. With predominantly westerly winds, there is a potential for the adjacent metropolitan residents to the east to be exposed to airborne cyanobacteria- and cyanotoxin-containing dust. During the summer and fall months of 2022, air and dried sediment samples were collected and assessed for the presence of BMAA which has been identified as a risk factor for ALS. Collection of air samples equivalent to a person breathing for 1 h resulted in BMAA and isomers being found in some air samples, along with their presence in exposed lakebed samples. There was no clear relationship between the presence of these toxins in airborne and adjacent lakebed samples, suggesting that airborne toxins may originate from diffuse rather than point sources. These findings confirm that continued low water levels in the Great Salt Lake may constitute an increasing health hazard for the 2.5 million inhabitants of communities along the Wasatch Front.						metcalf, james/0000-0003-3011-3973														2072-6651				NOV	2023	15	11							659	10.3390/toxins15110659	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxins15110659								37999522					WOS:001113753000001
J	Güsewell, S; Le Nédic, C				Güsewell, S; Le Nédic, C			Effects of winter mowing on vegetation succession in a lakeshore fen	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												To assess whether winter mowing in wetlands fulfils the aim of preventing succession towards drier communities, 34 permanent quadrats (15 m(2)) were surveyed annually from 1984-1985 to 2000 within large mown and unmown (control) areas (several ha) in a calcareous lake shore fen (W Switzerland). Three trends were noticed: decrease of aquatic species, spread of Cladium mariscus and establishment of woody species (especially Alnus glutinosa and Frangula alnus). None of these trends was prevented by mowing, but mowing did prevent the accumulation of C. mariscus litter and kept woody saplings small. Succession was generally slow and often occurred in the form of sudden, discrete changes. Plant species richness increased with mowing and remained constant without mowing. Soil disturbance by the mowing machine contributed more to the effects of management on species composition than the periodic removal of biomass. It is concluded that mowing every three years in winter is insufficient to preserve semi-aquatic communities against succession but sufficient to maintain the plant species richness of a low productive, regularly flooded fen.																			1402-2001					MAY	2004	7	1					41	48		10.1111/j.1654-109X.2004.tb00594.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1654-109X.2004.tb00594.x													WOS:000221960200006

The average concentrations of arsenic (As), selenium, and fluorine for each water category decreased in the following order: arsenic (in g/L: hot spring 241.37 > lake 27.46 > stream 22.11 > shallow well 11.57 > deep well 6.22), selenium (in g/L: deep well 0.85 > shallow well 0.68 > stream 0.62 > hot spring 0.39 > lake 0.36), and fluorine (in mg/L: hot spring 2.10 > lake 1.06 > deep well 0.45 > stream 0.20 > shallow well 0.15). The distribution of arsenic in Tibetan waters ranged between 77.35 g/L in Ali prefecture and 1.17 g/L in Chamdo prefecture, with intermediate values of 4.39, 2.52, 2.10, 1.68, and 1.51 g/L in the prefectures of Shigatse, Nagchu, Lhasa, Lhoka, and Nyingchi, respectively. Carbonatite is a major source of elements in these waters. The non-carcinogenic risk in Tibet caused by heavy metals in drinking water is low overall, except in Ali prefecture's surface and shallow ground waters, which contain high levels of As. Thus, deep well water in Tibet is safe to drink.

However, little is known regarding the roles of viruses in the succession, such as in huge reservoirs. Here, we investigated the viral infection characteristics of phytoplankton and bacterioplankton during the summer bloom succession in Xiangxi Bay of Three Gorges Reservoir, China. The results indicated that three distinct bloom stages and two successions were observed. From cyanobacteria and diatom codominance to cyanobacteria dominance, the first succession involved different phyla and led to a Microcystis bloom. From Microcystis dominance to Microcystis and Anabaena codominance, the second succession was different Cyanophyta genera and resulted in the persistence of cyanobacterial bloom. The structural equation model (SEM) showed that the virus had positive influence on the phytoplankton community. Through the Spearman's correlation and redundancy analysis (RDA), we speculated that both the increase of viral lysis in the eukaryotic community and the increase of lysogeny in cyanobacteria may contributed to the first succession and Microcystis blooms. In addition, the nutrients supplied by the lysis of bacterioplankton might benefit the second succession of different cyanobacterial genera and sustain the dominance of cyanobacteria. Based on hierarchical partitioning method, the viral variables still have a marked effect on the dynamics of phytoplankton community, although the environmental attributes were the major factors. Our findings suggested that viruses played multiple potential roles in summer bloom succession and may help the blooms success of cyanobacteria in Xiangxi Bay. Under the background of increasingly serious cyanobacterial blooms worldwide, our study may have great ecological and environmental significance for understanding the population succession in phytoplankton and controlling the cyanobacterial blooms.																				1664-302X				MAR 8	2023	14								1112590	10.3389/fmicb.2023.1112590	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1112590								36970686					WOS:000950965200001

We show that distinct lake-level fluctuations at Lake Trasimeno (Italy) are associated with changing aridity in the central Mediterranean during the last similar to 47 800 years. The lake-level fluctuations are reconstructed based on carbonate mineral content and carbonate mineral species, as well as the stable oxygen and carbon isotope (delta O-18 and delta C-13) geochemistry of endogenic carbonates. Low lake levels are linked to high carbonate, Mg-calcite and aragonite contents, and high delta O-18 and delta C-13 values. Inferred hydrological changes are linked to glacial-interglacial and, tentatively within the limitations of our chronology, to millennial-scale climate variability as well as the intensity of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Prior to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), during intervals equivalent to Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3), a stronger AMOC associated with Greenland interstadial periods (Dansgaard/Oeschger (D/O) warm periods) and stronger Asian monsoon probably coincide with increased precipitation in central Italy as inferred from high lake levels at Lake Trasimeno. Periods of weak AMOC intensity such as during Greenland stadials (D/O cold periods), during Heinrich events, and weak Asian monsoons are correlated with lake level lowstands, which imply relatively dry conditions in central Italy. Lake Trasimeno's water level during the LGM and the Lateglacial (MIS 2) is relatively stable, with recorded changes showing distinct similarities to orbital configurations. Although muted, high latitude climate forcing is still evident in the data during peak glacial conditions. The transition from D/O-like hydrological variability at Lake Trasimeno during MIS 3 to orbitally controlled fluctuations during the Lateglacial to Holocene transition coincides with an increasing amplitude in local winter and summer insolation, probably indicating increasing seasonality and a larger temperature gradient between low- and high-latitude settings.

Our analysis indicated a positive correlation between the winter presence of Microcystis and the timing of the annual spring bloom of Peridinium in Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee, Israel). Microcystis severely inhibited the growth of Peridinium in mixed laboratory cultures. This was attributed to the excretion of allelopathic substances rather than to successful competition for nutrients. Microcystis-free spent medium (MFSM) inhibited steady-state photosynthesis of Peridinium, as indicated by the reduced rate of oxygen evolution and by a suppressed fluorescence signal. Boosting the inorganic carbon concentration to 25 mmol L-1, i.e., 10-fold higher than essential to saturate photosynthesis in the absence of MFSM, partially restored the photosynthetic capacity. MFSM-treated Peridinium cells accumulated a larger internal inorganic carbon pool concomitantly with reduced accumulation of photosynthetic products. The MFSM slowed the hydration rate of CO2 (assessed from the rate of O-18 exchange between (CO2)-C-13-O-18 and water), indicating that the activity of an internal carbonic anhydrase was severely depressed. Although the nature of the active component in the MFSM that inhibits CA activity has yet to be identified, the ecological consequences of its excretion to the water body are emerging as a potent allelopathic Substance that may control the development of phytoplankton competitors. We propose that its allelopathic activity could control the fate and succession of the P. gatunense bloom in Lake Kinneret.					; Kaplan, Aaron/GLN-5655-2022; Tchernov, Dan/AAE-2545-2021	Kaplan, Aaron/0000-0002-0815-5731; Tchernov, Dan/0000-0003-1135-8270; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2002	47	6					1656	1663		10.4319/lo.2002.47.6.1656	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2002.47.6.1656													WOS:000179650200009

Annual water residence time effects on thermal structure: A potential lake restoration measure	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Innovative methods to combat internal loading issues in eutrophic lakes are urgently needed to speed recovery and restore systems within legislative deadlines. In stratifying lakes, internal phosphorus loading is particularly problematic during the summer stratified period when anoxia persists in the hypolimnion, promoting phos-phorus release from the sediment. A novel method to inhibit stratification by reducing residence times is pro-posed as a way of controlling the length of the hypolimnetic anoxic period, thus reducing the loading of nutrients from the sediments into the water column. However, residence time effects on stratification length in natural lakes are not well understood. We used a systematic modelling approach to investigate the viability of changes to annual water residence time in affecting lake stratification and thermal dynamics in Elterwater, a small strati-fying eutrophic lake in the northwest of England. We found that reducing annual water residence times shortened and weakened summer stratification. Based on finer-scale dynamics of lake heat fluxes and water column sta-bility we propose seasonal or sub-seasonal management of water residence time is needed for the method to be most effective at reducing stratification as a means of controlling internal nutrient loading.

Were fossil spring-associated carbonates near Zaca Lake, Santa Barbara, California deposited under an ambient or thermal regime?	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												A previously undescribed succession of currently-inactive spring-associated carbonates located near Zaca Lake, Southern California, was investigated in order to determine the nature of deposition (ambient temperature or hydrothermal water, as both are found within the region). The carbonate deposits are up to similar to 1 m thick and formed discontinuously for over 200 m in a narrow valley between two ridges that drain Miocene Monterey Formation bedrock. Depositional facies along the presently dry fluvial path include barrage deposits, narrow fluvial channels, and cascade deposits. The carbonates are mesoscopically banded and contain ubiquitous micro- to macrophyte calcite encrusted fabrics. All of the depositional fades contain alternating bands (similar to.05 mm to 5 mm thick) of dark brown and light brown isopachous calcite; the dark brown bands are composed of dense isopachous bladed calcite, whereas the light brown bands are composed of bundles of calcite tubules interpreted as the biosignature of the desmid microalgae Oocardium stratum. Oxygen isotope thermometry utilizing modern water delta O-18 values from the piped spring reveal depositional water temperature estimates that collectively range from similar to 11 to 16 degrees C. Stable isotope carbon values exhibit a mean delta C-13 value of -9.01 +/- 0.62%. (1 sigma, n = 27). Our petrographic and geochemical data demonstrate that (1) inactive carbonates were likely sourced from ambient temperature water with a strong soil-zone delta C-13 signal, (2) the Oocardium calcite biosignature can be used to infer depositional temperature and flow conditions, and (3) the occurrence of extensive carbonates (especially the presence of a perched cascade deposit) indicate the carbonates formed when conditions were much wetter. 2013 Elsevier B.V.

INFLUENCE OF GAS PRODUCTION AND FILAMENT ORIENTATION ON STROMATOLITE MICROFABRIC	PALAIOS												Alternating light-dark laminae within stromatolites have been attributed to a phototactic response of the constituent microbial communities, whereby filaments orient vertically during the day and recline at night. This study examines the orientation of cyanobacterial filaments within a laminated siliceous stromatolite from a Yellowstone National Park hot spring to identify the controls on microfabric development and whether phototaxis plays a role. Results indicate that filament orientation is predominantly perpendicular or parallel to lamination, even when laminae are steeply inclined. Thus, phototaxis is not a significant control of microfabric development in these stromatolites. Vertical aspects of the fabric are dominated by hourglass-shaped filament bundles (hourglass structures) adjacent to rounded pores, rather than being defined by individual filaments. The rounded pores likely represent oxygen-rich bubbles generated during photosynthesis. Upon stabilization by filaments, upward buoyancy of the bubbles rotated the bundles toward a vertical orientation. Thus, vertical aspects of the fabric in this stromatolite result from buoyancy forces rather than phototaxis. Examples from the Neoproterozoic Beck Spring Dolomite reveal that similar subvertical hourglass structures are present in the rock record and may be better preserved than individual filaments. The presence of rounded pores (fenestrae) and hourglass structures in ancient microbialites, here termed the hourglass-associated fenestral fabric, can serve as an indication of biogenic influence in stromatolites, especially in the absence of preserved filaments, and may be an indication of oxygenic photosynthesis.

J	LAIR, N				LAIR, N			SPACE-TIME DISTRIBUTION, BIOMASS AND PRODUCTION OF ZOOPLANKTON POPULATION IN LAKE AYDAT DURING SUMMER	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lake Aydat is a young eutrophic lake (mean depth 7.4 m, area 60 ha) situated in the French Central Massif. Secondary production was studied during the summer months, June and July. In early summer, dissolved O2 in the deep layers gradually becomes depleted, and depletion reaches the 7-m level in July. Zooplankton is therefore concentrated in the upper layers: Rotatoria are very abundant and the various species are segregated in space and/or succeed each other in time, thus maximally exploiting the water layers favorable to their development. Cladocera are represented by small species, which sharply increase in number at the time of maximum primary production, and cause a dramatic drop in primary production. They are in competition with the Rotatoria. Copepods are the least abundant group, but were in a reproductive phase at the time of this study. Of the zooplankton biomass, 88% is accumulated in the Cladocera; the Rotifera represent 9% and the Copepods, 8%. Secondary production is intense and due almost exclusively to filter-feeders in July. Since the carnivores are scarce in numbers, their maximum production is poor relative to that of the herbivores. The P/B [production/biomass] coefficient was extremely high during the 2 summer months and is indicative of a process of intense consumption of the resources of the lake during that particular short period of the year.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1978	61	3					237	256		10.1007/BF00044450	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00044450													WOS:A1978GB25300006

These time-scales become relevant when a disturbance rocks the ecosystem. Here we try to explain the fast dynamics of plankton and nutrients in the water column of floodplain lakes after disturbances (inundations). We take advantage of natural experiments, that is occasional massive overflow of floodplain takes with river water. We sampled 10 lakes in two floodplains along the Dutch river Waal monthly for 3 years, capturing the impact of three inundation events. The inundations reset the plankton as well as chemical composition of most lakes to largely the same state. While biologically inert macro-ion data reflected a large and long lasting impact of the river water, dynamics of nutrients, phytoplankton and zooplankton communities between lakes diverged in a few weeks to regimes characteristic for the different lakes. While one spring inundation synchronized plankton dynamics to let the subsequent clear water phase occur at the same moment in different lakes, winter inundations did not have the same effect and apparently dynamics quickly diverged. Our results showed that effects of inundations and other processes that affect the state of the ecosystem should be studied considering the level of the slow components such as the sediment nutrient pool, fish stock and macrophyte communities. Plankton communities and take water nutrient status give a practically instantaneous reflection of the condition of these slow components.

Estuarine fish behavior around slotted water control structures in a managed salt marsh	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Estuaries are composed of multiple interconnected habitat types used by transient fish species during their period of estuarine residency. Structural marsh management restricts habitat connectivity and impedes the movement of fishes among these habitat types by limiting access via water control structures (WCSs) between the managed area and the rest of the estuary. While some general information on fish passage rates is available, species-specific information on passage through WCSs is lacking for salt marsh fishes. We monitored tagged fishes from March 2012 through November 2013 using passive integrated transponder antenna arrays at two identical WCSs in the Calcasieu Lake estuary, Louisiana, USA, to assess the effect of slotted WCSs on fish behavior. A total of 420 individuals of 15 species was tagged and released at the WCSs; of these, 145 individuals representing 11 species were later detected at the WCSs. Five species comprised most (93%) of the detected individuals: Elops saurus (n = 60), Mugil cephalus (n = 43), Sciaenops ocellatus (n = 20), Pogonias cromis (n = 7), and Ariopsis felis (n = 5). Passage rates were low, with most of the observed fishes (n = 80) passing only once through the structures. Other than E. saurus, which was only observed migrating out of the managed marsh, no clear pattern in swimming direction was observed for the other species. Detected species were all present primarily during the summer and fall, however, diel activity at the structures varied by species. The WCSs in our study area appeared to attract and congregate fishes, functioning more like ecological hotspots, rather than simply facilitating fish passage.

No coupling between HNAN abundance and biomass and the abundance and biomass of their picoplanktonic prey was observed for the investigation period. The ratio of heterotrophic bacterial to HNAN abundance ranged from 2.2 x 10(3) to 8.6 x 10(3) (mean: 4.2 x 10(3) 1.8 x 10(3)). HNAN carbon consumption could account for only 10% to 40% of bacterial secondary production. The lack of coupling between HNAN and their potential prey and the low HNAN abundance relative to bacterial abundance suggested (a) that HNAN grazing was an insignificant factor in the regulation of bacterial abundance and (b) that HNAN abundance was regulated by predation rather than by prey abundance. This hypothesis was supported by the fact that HNAN growth rates were high (in the range of 0.45 d(-1) to 1.00 d(-1) during spring and summer, yearly mean: 0.52 d(-1)), and only weakly correlated with prey abundance and biomass. The results indicated strong top-down control of HNAN and consequently a weak coupling of HNAN and picoplankton in the investigated eutrophic freshwater environment.

Calculated pulmonary vascular resistance index fell from 12.3 to 3.8 mm Hg/1/min/n2 (normal 2.3). Average right a trial and pulmonary artery wedge mean pressures fell from 21 to 0 and 23 to 12mm Hg (normal 0 and 6), respectively consistent with disappearance of congestive heart failure.

The occurrence of these natural hazards in populated areas have encouraged a recent sharp increase of studies that aim to mitigate their impact on human lives and assess infrastructure lost. This paper amalgamates in a novel fashion and at an unprecedented detail in situ historic measurements, geological data and numerical modeling of a rock fall event and associated tsunami wave that occurred in Lake Lovatnet (western Norway) in September 1936. Historical records report an event that released ca. 1 million m(3) of rocks and debris from Ramnefjellet Mountain at an altitude of 800 m above Lake Lovatnet. The fragmented material plunged into the lake, causing a tsunami that reached a maximum run-up of 74 m and killed 74 people. In fact, the settlements of Bodal and Nesdal were wiped out as a result of the catastrophic wave. Sediments resulting from the 1936 rock fall and associated tsunami were identified in the subsurface of Lake Lovatnet by shallow geophysical investigations and were retrieved using gravity coring equipment. A set of high resolution physical and geochemical measurements were carried out on the cores with the aim of reproducing a highly detailed reconstruction of this catastrophic event in order to better understand and learn about the processes involved. The cores were retrieved in the northwestern sub-basin of the lake and its chronology was constrained by Pb-210 and radiocarbon dating. A specially tailored physically based mathematical model was applied to better understand the tsunami event. Integration of the geophysical record, the sedimentological data and numerical modeling provide a comprehensive background to better understand the effects of such event in a deep fjord-like lacustrine basin and to generate information for better mitigation of similar events elsewhere.

J	Xu, Y				Xu, Ying			Stabilization of Heavy Metal-Contaminated Sediment with a Chelator and Humic Acid Mixture	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												A chelator, potassium dipropyl dithiophosphate, and humic acid were combined and used as a stabilizing agent to study the stabilization effect of the mixture on heavy metals in a contaminated sediment. The results indicated that the stabilization efficiencies for Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd in the sediment were up to 99.98, 90.66, 99.38, and 92.83%, respectively, and the unstable Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd fractions fell by 57.11, 54.74, 56.41, and 89.14%, respectively, when 5% potassium dipropyl dithiophosphate and 7% humic acid were added. This significantly reduced the bioavailability of the heavy metals. Under leaching caused by simulated acid rain (pH 3 and pH 5), the heavy metals mainly migrated from the solid phase to the liquid phase during the initial leaching period, and the Pb, Cu, Zn, and Cd leaching rates in the sediment after stabilization fell by 55-99%. Cu showed the greatest reduction. When the results for the sediment after stabilization were compared with the sediment before stabilization, the wheat stem height had increased by 53.62%, the dry weights of the leaves and roots increased by 86.25 and 34.85%, respectively, and Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd enrichment in the wheat roots and leaves fell by 40-88 and 73-95%, respectively.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				JAN	2017	228	1							20	10.1007/s11270-016-3198-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-016-3198-z													WOS:000390681700021

The landscape varies from lowlands around Hudson Bay in the east and flat plains in the south, to moderate elevation hills and numerous lakes in the north, to a complex terrain of high mountains and deep valleys in the west. Interpolation methods used to create the grids range from a very simple technique - Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) of closest neighbours, to more sophisticated statistical models -ANUSPLIN (thin plate smoothing splines 017 geographic location and elevation) and SQUARE-GRID (multivariate regression oil elevation, distance front large water bodies and barriers, etc.), to even more complex hybrid systems - PRISM (statistical regression, combined with physical models and expert knowledge). The main characteristics of each technique arc discussed in detail, as they are often very good predictors of the accuracy of the ensuing gridpoint values. Based on the intercomparison and average values, as well as the verification of temperature with upper air soundings and precipitation with stream flow, measurements, all grids, except SQUARE-GRID for precipitation, produce very good results in the Prairies' ecozone. Temperatures in most cases agree within 1 degrees C and precipitation within several percent. PRISM, which was verified to model the Arctic inversion correctly, performs the best in winter ill northern Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Alberta, in particular, over the hills of northern Alberta (PRISM warmer), and most likely over low dying areas of the Nelson River Delta (PRISM colder). PRISM and ANUSPLIN can be recommended for the mountains of south-eastern British Columbia and southwestern Alberta. Both grids verity well, in both winter and summer, with upper air soundings for maximum temperature and station vertical profiles for minimum temperature. They are remarkably close to water balance estimates of precipitation computed from streamflow gauge measurements - PRISM is slightly high and ANSUPLIN slightly low. Precipitation front IDW and SQUARE-GRID are not satisfactory in the mountains; both severely underestimate precipitation by as much as 40%. IDW, which does not incorporate any orographic effects, is also too warm in the mountains. As expected, topography, phlysiography, and monitoring network issues are sources of major discrepancies among the grids. SQUARE-GRID, besides using far fewer stations and a preprocessed dataser, also produced anomalous values, e.g., values of zero precipitation along the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains.																			0705-5900	1480-9214				MAR	2005	43	1					49	75		10.3137/ao.430104	http://dx.doi.org/10.3137/ao.430104													WOS:000228268500004

Study on the causes of drought and drought monitoring technology is crucial for drought mitigation. This study conducts drought monitoring based on temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) and investigates with the impact of anthropogenic pressure in the Poyang Lake basin (PYLB). In the study, the MODIS normalized vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) products from 2000 to 2021 were selected to construct NDVI-LST feature space processed with elevation correction, from which the monthly TVDI data was calculated. The land use data and nighttime light data were used to construct the anthropogenic pressure index (API). The results indicate that the frequency of drought in the PYLB is higher in the south and lower in the north. According to drought influence scope (DIS), the occurrence frequency of basin-wide drought (DIS & GE; 50%) in the PYLB is the highest, followed by regional drought (33%<DIS < 50%), partial local drought (25%<DIS < 33%), and local drought (10%<DIS < 25%). The basin as a whole showed an obvious wetting trend in spring and a drying trend in autumn. During the study period, API in the north of PYLB was obviously higher than that in the south, and showed a general increasing trend. The contribution of human activities to drought in the PYLB increased exponentially with the improvement of social development level. Meanwhile, the impact of human activities on drought shows spatial differentiation. Ecological protection and green development have been implemented in the northerly region of the PYLB, and anthropogenic pressure inhibited the degree of drought. Oppositely, extensive socioeconomic development in the central and southern parts of the PYLB has caused damage to the environment and indirectly aggravated regional drought. This study makes important contributions to exploring the response between remote sensing drought monitoring and anthropogenic pressure and promoting regional drought mitigation in humid areas.					; Yuan, Yanping/IAR-0596-2023	Ye, Xuchun/0000-0001-8408-8318; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2023	154								110584	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110584	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110584		JUL 2023											WOS:001029106800001

Using 36Cl exposure dating to date mass movement and assess land stability on the Nicholas Range, Tasmania	LANDSLIDES												Detailed mapping of dolerite slope deposits overlying sedimentary Triassic rocks on the northern slopes of the Nicholas Range in northeastern Tasmania has revealed an extensive mass movement complex. Landforms north of the summit plateau of the Nicholas Range include the following: (1) a cliff of dolerite columns with associated scree slopes at its base; (2) a topple landscape consisting of several topples that have fallen in a north-easterly direction; (3) a "ripple" landscape consisting of a series of long boulder ridges aligned approximately east-west. Exposure dates were obtained for three large boulders (collapsed dolerite columns) from a ridge within the ripple landscape. The two youngest dates gave a mean age of 52.1 +/- 1.9 ka using Cl-36. This is the estimated age for collapse of the dated columns from the cliff face c. 750 m to the south. Boulder ages and landscape morphology indicate that the ripple landscape developed by physical and chemical degradation and concurrent northern displacement of topples over a slip plane formed at the contact between dolerite colluvium and underlying Triassic sedimentary rocks. There is no evidence of movement today, other than localised debris flows associated with knickpoints in streams, and it is deduced that movement on the slip plane occurred under a cooler climate than that prevailing today, possibly under the influence of melting of winter snow during the last glacial cycle. As there is no evidence of significant recent mass movement and forests in the area are likely to have experienced many stand-destroying forest fires in the Holocene, forest harvest is not considered to pose a risk to landscape stability.

J	Hussell, DJT				Hussell, DJT			Climate change, spring temperatures, and timing of breeding of tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) in southern Ontario	AUK												Several European studies have indicated advances in breeding dates of birds in the last 30 years, which authors attributed to climate change. In North America, Dunn and Winkler (1999) reported a continent-wide advance of five to nine days in breeding dates of Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) between 1959 and 1991. I present results of an intensive study of Tree Swallows breeding on and near Long Point, Ontario, at four sites monitored 1969-2001, 1977-1986, 1978-2001, and 1987-2001. Local air temperatures varied among sites, according to distance from Lake Erie, but there was no significant regional trend in April and May temperatures between 1969 and 2000. Median and 10th percentile dates of clutch initiation by females that were at least two years old varied among years by up to 20 days overall and 18 days within sites, and differed by 0-14 days between sites in the same year. There were no significant differences in average timing of laying among the 1970-1980, 1980-1990, and 1990-2000 periods. Nevertheless, there was a significant trend towards earlier laying in 1990-2000, which was attributable to exceptionally early laying and warm May weather in 1998-2001. Across all sites, median dates of clutch initiation were strongly correlated with average daily maximum temperatures in the first four, five-day periods in May, but clutches at one site were initiated three days earlier than predicted by temperatures alone. I estimate that climate warming of 5 degreesC in May could result in an average advance of about seven days in the median date of laying of Tree Swallows at those sites. My results indicate that spring temperatures are strongly correlated with timing of laying, but show that spring temperatures have not increased in the Long Point region and timing of the breeding season has not advanced throughout North America.																				1938-4254				JUL	2003	120	3					607	618		10.1642/0004-8038(2003)120[0607:CCSTAT]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1642/0004-8038(2003)120[0607:CCSTAT]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000184830800004

US EPA, Off Res & Dev EMAP				The Great Lakes may be viewed as a coastal environment, affected by the same meteorological and physical forces as the coastal ocean. The U. S. EPA, Great Lakes National Program Office ( GLNPO) has monitored the open waters of the lakes, annually, since 1983. As part of the U. S. EPA Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program ( EMAP), a pilot study was performed in Lake Michigan to compare the existing GLNPO deterministic sampling grid with the EMAP probabilistic grid. Results of chemical analyses of trophic status indicators ( total phosphorus and chlorophyll a) as well as nutrients and conventional limnological measurements, from spring and summer surveys in 1992 indicate little difference between the grids in the offshore region of the lake. The few statistically significant differences may be due to station distribution throughout the lake, or simple chance. This might be expected due to the well mixed nature of the open waters of Lake Michigan. The detection of a long-term trend for total phosphorus in Lake Michigan benefits from an annual program: viewing cumulative frequency distributions based on a four year EMAP interval does not convey information on the decrease in phosphorus in the lake. If the EMAP sampling grid were to be used in the Great Lakes, pilots in each of the lakes would be necessary for utilization of the existing long-term record as a basis for trend detection.																			0167-6369					JAN-FEB	2003	81	1-3					63	71		10.1023/A:1021304403117	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1021304403117								12620005					WOS:000179560300008

Diet overlap between young-of-the-year perch, Perca fluviatilis L., and burbot, Lota lota (L.), during early life-history stages	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												The diet overlap between young-of-the-year (YOY) perch and burbot in the pelagic zone of Lake Constance during spring and summer was investigated in relation to gape size limitation. Because perch were larger and grew faster than burbot during their early life history, perch overcame gape size limitation for various zooplankton taxa earlier than burbot. The interspecific diet overlap between perch and burbot decreased continuously until June, but increased slightly, when burbot became able to feed on large daphnids by the beginning of July. All zooplankton taxa could be found within perch stomachs by the middle of June, when perch overcame gape size limitation for large cladocerans. However, there was an increasing tendency for individual diet specialisation of perch, as the similarity between individual perch stomach contents decreased. In contrast, the similarity between individual burbot stomach contents remained at almost 50% until the end of August, indicating that all burbot rely on cyclopoid copepods during their entire pelagic life-history stage. Because by July YOY perch are more abundant by one order of magnitude in the pelagic zone than burbot, YOY perch may be more affected by intraspecific competition than by interspecific competition with burbot. Burbot, on the other hand, may evade strong competition with YOY perch by performing diel vertical migrations, thus being restricted to feed on migrating zooplankton prey.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				DEC	2009	18	4					527	537		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2009.00367.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2009.00367.x													WOS:000271631000005

The satellite-derived surface algal bloom area and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration are commonly used as indicators to judge the water quality. However, vertical migration of phytoplankton may seriously affect the assessment accuracy of water quality with the surface status as an indicator. In fact, the water column-integrated algal biomass is better for describing the water quality. To remotely estimate the algal biomass considering the vertical Chl-a profile (uniform or otherwise), this paper proposed a novel process-oriented algorithm applied successfully in Lake Chaohu, China. First, we built a decision tree to identify the pixel-based Chl-a profile types using the floating algae index, surface Chl-a concentration, and wind speed. Then, the nonuniform profile was expressed as a power decay function (Chl-a(z) = n1 ? zn2) and parameterized using the surface Chl-a concentration. Finally, the algal biomass was derived from MODIS/Aqua satellite data. The estimation results were acceptable and the bias was -19.95%. The monthly mean algal biomass varied significantly and exhibited two peaks in spring and summer. The annual mean algal biomass increased from 2003 to 2010 (Pearson r = 0.82; p < 0.05) and then decreased from 2012 to 2018 (r = -0.71; p = 0.07). Monthly variations were determined by the air temperature (77.09%), but annual variations were primarily influenced by ammonia nitrogen level (44.61%). With known algal biomass and wind speed, the pixelbased algal bloom probability could be forecasted. The developed process-oriented algorithm was also applicable to eutrophic Lake Taihu, China. This study is of great significance for scientifically assessing water quality and effectively managing aquatic environmental disasters.

LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Seasonal concentration changes in monomethylmercury (MMHg) and total Hg (T-Hg) were determined in Devil's Lake, Wisconsin, a lake with a mercury consumption advisory for walleye. Mercury dynamics were studied in water and several lower food chain fractions during the ice-free seasons in 1994 and 1995, and limited data for Hg in water were collected in 1993. MMHg concentrations increased in hypolimnetic waters before turnover each year, although maximum concentrations declined from 1993 to 1995. As the hypolimnion eroded, MMHg concentrations increased in both particulate matter and Daphnia. Maximum concentrations were obtained near the time of complete mixis. The magnitude of this increase correlated with the mass of hypolimnetic MMHg that had built up prior to turnover in 1994 and 1995. Hg concentrations in yearling planktivorous fish exhibited a decline corresponding to the decline in hypolimnetic MMHg from 1993 to 1995. Our results suggest that fall destratification represents an important time period for entry of MMHg to the food chain of lakes exhibiting a hypolimnetic MMHg buildup.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	1998	43	7					1476	1486		10.4319/lo.1998.43.7.1476	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1998.43.7.1476													WOS:000077285000008
J	Schaetzl, RJ; Isard, SA				Schaetzl, RJ; Isard, SA			Regional-scale relationships between climate and strength of podzolization in the Great Lakes Region, North America	CATENA												Along a 300 km transect in northern Wisconsin and the upper peninsula of Michigan, the areal coverage of Spodosols and spodic horizon development increases markedly from south to north. This study elucidated those aspects of climate that promote podzolization in this region, through an examination of the geographic correspondences between Spodosol development and soil climate. Climatic data (1951-1991) from 21 sites along this transect were processed by a hydrologic model developed to output data on (1) soil temperatures for 0.05 and 0.5 m depths for 20 minute intervals, including data on soil freezing, (2) snowpack thicknesses under forest cover, and (3) daily water fluxes, runoff, and soil water contents at several depths. Spodosols dominate the landscape in areas where soil frost and freeze-thaw activity are minimal and where soil temperatures rarely exceed 16-17 degrees C. Podzolization is strongest where snowpacks are thickest - an association that holds at both regional and meso scales. Thick snowpacks inhibit soil frost and allow large fluxes of snowmelt water to infiltrate into already moist profiles. This type of flux (slow, steady, cold water) may be particularly effective in the podzolization process. In the southern part of the transect, where Spodosols are rare, snowmelt fluxes are 1/3 as large as in the northern ''snowbelt'' areas. The southern areas also have a small autumn infiltration peak that usually reaches to approximate to 0.3 m depth; this flux is absent in areas of strong podzolization Mean soil water contents are low and fluxes of water into the soil are small along the entire transect during summer, underscoring the belief that the bulk of pedogenesis (i.e., translocation), in Spodosols in the study area, occurs during snowmelt.																			0341-8162					DEC	1996	28	1-2					47	69		10.1016/S0341-8162(96)00029-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0341-8162(96)00029-X													WOS:A1996VW91200003

In this study, we present a continuous history of the ISM over the past similar to 9700 years using the high-resolution delta O-18 composition of alpha-cellulose (delta O-18(cell)) derived from sedges in a high-altitude peatland in the south-central part of the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The results show that the delta O-18(cell) values increased gradually from the early Holocene, implying a weakening trend of the ISM. However, a remarkable decrease in delta O-18(cell) occurred after 2.0 cal ka BP, which is consistent with the recently reported '2-kyr shift' in stalagmite delta O-18. Further compilation of reconstructions across Asia demonstrates that the '2-kyr shift' suggests an anomalous intensification of the ISM during the late Holocene. In addition, we propose the concept of a '2-kyr dry event' characterized by the weakest ISM intensity, lasting for approximately a thousand years. The ISM record is influenced by boreal summer insolation and ocean-atmosphere coupling in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The '2-kyr shift' and '2-kyr dry event' in the ISM region could be linked to the SSTs of the western Arabian Sea and the Pacific warm pool, which superimposed on the reduced solar insolation. This study highlights the delta O-18 in peat alpha-cellulose responds well to monsoon intensity at our study site and the important role that ocean-atmosphere circulation plays in regulating centennial-millennial regional hydroclimate variability.

Monitoring the dynamic variation of PC concentration in lakes by satellite remote sensing is of great significance for the effective prevention and control of cyanobacterial blooms (CBs). Few studies have quantitatively monitored the long-term PC concentration variation in water and explored the relationship between PC concentration and CBs based on the advantages of the high temporal and spectral resolution of Sentinel-3 OLCI images. In this study, a retrieval model of PC concentration suitable for Sentinel-3 OLCI images was constructed and applied to the Sentinel-3 image dataset from May 2016 to November 2021 to analyze the spatiotemporal PC concentration variations in Chaohu Lake of China. The factors influencing PC concentration and its indicative significance for CBs outbreak were also explored. The results show that the PC concentration retrieval model based on the gradient boosting regression algorithm has the best performance (R-2 = 0.86, root mean square error = 45.44 ug/L, and mean absolute percentage error = 26.27 %), which has great application potential in the retrieval of other water quality parameters. In summer and autumn, the PC concentration in western Chaohu Lake was higher than that in other lake parts, which was mainly related to the higher nutrient concentration and prevailing wind direction in this part. During 2016-2021, the average PC concentration in Chaohu Lake in 2019 was the highest, and that in 2017 was the lowest, mainly affected by air temperature and precipitation. The variation of PC concentration in Chaohu Lake has a high temporal consistency with the proportion of CBs area, and the PC concentration of 303.9 mu g/L is a necessary condition for CBs outbreak. This study revealed that Sentinel-3 OLCI images could provide a useful data source for high-frequency dynamic monitoring of PC concentrations in lakes and reservoirs, and the quantitative monitoring of PC concentrations in water has relevant indicative significance for early warning of CBs in inland water.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2022	143								109340	10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109340	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109340		AUG 2022											WOS:000862829800008

Hydrogeochemical dynamics affecting steam-heated pools at El Chichon Crater (Chiapas - Mexico)	GEOFLUIDS												El Chichon is an active volcano located in the north-western Chiapas, southern Mexico. The crater hosts a lake, a spring, named Soap Pool, emerging from the underlying volcanic aquifer and several mud pools/hot springs on the internal flanks of the crater which strongly interact with the current fumarolic system (steam-heated pools). Some of these pools, the crater lake and a cold spring emerging from the 1982 pumice deposits, have been sampled and analysed. Water-volcanic gas interactions determine the heating (43-99 degrees C) and acidification (pH 2-4) of the springs, mainly by H2S oxidation. Significantly, in the study area, a significant NH3 partial pressure has been also detected. Such a geochemically aggressive environment enhances alteration of the rock in situ and strongly increases the mineralization of the waters (and therefore their electrical conductivity). Two different mineralization systems were detected for the crater waters: the soap pool-lake (Na+/Cl- = 0.4, Na/Mg>10) and the crater mud pools (Na+/Cl- > 10, Na/Mg < 4). A deep boiling, Na+-K+-Cl--rich water reservoir generally influences the Soap Pool-lake, while the mud pool is mainly dominated by water-gas-rock interactions. In the latter case, conductivity of sampled water is directly proportional to the presence of reactive gases in solution. Therefore, chemical evolution proceeds through neutralization due to both rock alteration and bacterial oxidation of ammonium to nitrate. The chemical compositions show that El Chichon aqueous fluids, within the crater, interact with gases fed by a geothermal reservoir, without clear additions of deep magmatic fluids. This new geochemical dataset, together with previously published data, can be used as a base line with which to follow-up the activity of this deadly volcano.

The effect of hydropower on fish stocks:: comparison between cascade and non-cascade reservoirs	HYDROBIOLOGIA					Symposium on Hydropower, Flood Control and Water Abstraction	JUN 14-17, 2006	Mondsee, AUSTRIA	European Inland Fisheries Advisory Commiss				Spatial distributions of fish were studied in two types of reservoirs by means of hydroacoustics during the summer. Different patterns of fish distribution were found in non-cascade (Rimov, Zelivka) and cascade (Kamyk, Slapy, Stechovice, Vrane) reservoirs. Maximum biomass and density of fish were observed in the tributary area of the non-cascade reservoir. The biomass declined towards the dam area. Average weight of fish showed the opposite trend-maximum average weight was observed in the dam area and declined towards the tributary area. In the cascade reservoirs fish distribution was found to be more complicated but the maximum biomass and density of fish were observed in the dam areas, whereas the tributary areas were nearly fishless. Poor ecohydrological conditions in the tributaries of cascade reservoirs are likely to be responsible for the low abundance of fish in these areas. This was evident in the example of Vrane reservoir which has two major inflows. Low biomass and density of fish were observed in the cold and low oxygen saturated inflowing cascade Vltava River while higher biomass and density were observed in the warm and well oxygen saturated Sazava River inflow. Average weights of fish followed the same trend as in non-cascade reservoirs-the maximum was in the dam area and it declined towards the tributary area. The vertical distribution of fish is driven by the fully developed stratification of temperature and oxygen during the summer season in non-cascade reservoirs. A significantly lower biomass of fish was observed below the thermocline in vertical surveys in both non-cascade and cascade reservoirs. Summer stratification in cascade reservoirs is weakly developed or is not developed at all due to hypolimnetic releases of cold water and short retention times. High transparency suggests lower primary production in cascade reservoirs.					; Prchalova, Marie/F-8664-2014; Kubecka, Jan/A-8230-2011; Cech, Martin/C-5797-2014; Prchalová, Marie/F-8664-2014; Frouzova, Jaroslava/F-8518-2014; Tušer, Michal/F-8548-2014; Draštík, Vladislav/G-2222-2014	Tuser, Michal/0000-0003-2881-392X; Prchalova, Marie/0000-0001-5000-2918; Drastik, Vladislav/0000-0002-9419-6977; Kubecka, Jan/0000-0001-9203-4854; Cech, Martin/0000-0003-1350-4286; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2008	609						25	36		10.1007/s10750-008-9393-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9393-1													WOS:000256928400003

However, the history of climate change and inferred spatial extent of the ASM on the NETP since the last deglaciation remain unclear. Here, we use several environmental proxies from the sediments of Hala Lake (beyond the modern limit of ASM), including chironomids, loss-on-ignition, grain size and element data, to explore the climatic history of the NETP and the northern boundary of the ASM since the last deglaciation. The results document a series of climatic events during the deglaciation, including Heinrich Event 1, the Bolling-Allerod interstadial and the Younger Dryas event. The records also reveal the timing of the megathermal and precipitation maximum, the lake-level maximum, and strongest chemical weathering, which occurred during similar to 10-7 ka. The inferred precipitation maximum during the early Holocene in the Hala Lake basin, which can be verified by the simulated precipitation change, is consistent with that in typical Indian summer monsoon (ISM) regions, suggesting that the ISM has penetrated into Hala Lake basin at that time. The monsoon-dominated climate in the Hala Lake basin during the early Holocene and the westerlies-dominated climate in the arid central Asia indicate that the maximum areal extent of the ASM on the NETP since the last deglaciation lay to the northwest of Hala Lake basin. In combination with other published records, the northernmost boundary of the ASM over China since the last deglaciation has been tentatively delineated, to shed some lights on this long-standing debate.

The climate of the TP is influenced by the interplay between the Asian summer monsoon (including both the East Asian summer monsoon and the Indian summer monsoon) and the westerlies. However, the specific changes in monsoon-driven vapor transport, the behavior of the westerlies, and their interactions with ongoing climate change remain unclear. In this study, we adopt a comprehensive approach that integrates luminescence chronology and climate modelling to reconstruct and simulate the paleoclimate changes during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5, i.e., the last interglacial period. Luminescence dating of K-feldspar, using both multiple and single grain techniques, was applied to establish reliable chronologies for three sedimentary sequences from two catchments, Qinghai Lake in the northern TP and Selin Co in the central-southern TP. Our findings reveal a striking discrepancy in the timing of lake highstands, occurring during the late MIS 5 in Qinghai Lake but during the early MIS 5 in Selin Co, respectively. Model simulations indicate that a strengthened Indian summer monsoon was the primary driver of increased precipitation and elevated lake-levels in the central-southern plateau, while enhanced westerlies and their southward shift led to wetter conditions in the northern TP. Despite ensemble models predicting a substantial long-term trend towards increased precipitation across the entire TP in the future, with a shift from dipole to monopole precipitation pattern, our study suggests that an out-of-phase precipitation pattern over the TP is likely to persist.

J	Shook, K; Pomeroy, JW				Shook, Kevin; Pomeroy, John W.			The effects of the management of Lake Diefenbaker on downstream flooding	CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL												The impact of management of Lake Diefenbaker, Saskatchewan, the Canadian Prairies' largest reservoir, on downstream flooding is examined over three large inflow events in 2005, 2011 and 2013. The reservoir stores inflows for water supply, recreational and ecological purposes and preferentially releases water in mid-winter for hydroelectricity generation. It can also have an important role in downstream flood mitigation. The analysis shows great uncertainty in inflows due to ungauged local inflows, and substantial errors in the mass balance of the reservoir associated primarily with high inflows. The management of the reservoir has been challenged by declining spring inflows since the 1960s with a trend for increasing minimum annual reservoir elevations over time. Management of the reservoir has undergone changes since 2011 to lower the minimum elevation so as to achieve the 1 July target level, resulting in very different effects on flooding in 2005, 2011 and 2013. In all years, the management of the reservoir reduced the maximum flooded area upstream of Saskatoon and the integrated flooded duration and area. In 2005 the area of flooding upstream of Saskatoon was reduced for all durations and in 2013 for durations shorter than 5 days, but in 2011 it was increased for durations between 5 and 20 days. Flooding on the Saskatchewan River, i.e. downstream of the confluence of the North and South Saskatchewan Rivers, was increased in 2011 due to the delay in the timing of the peak flow induced by reservoir operation. Elimination of downstream flooding in these years would have required continuous adjustment of outflows to optimize storage, which itself requires modelling the inflow hydrograph. Future operation of the reservoir should adopt such optimization and modelling, whilst considering the impact of non-stationarity due to climate change.

J	Wu, YH; Duguay, CR; Xu, LL				Wu, Yuhao; Duguay, Claude R.; Xu, Linlin			Assessment of machine learning classifiers for global lake ice cover mapping from MODIS TOA reflectance data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The topic of satellite remote sensing of lake ice has gained considerable attention in recent years. Optical satellite data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) allow for the monitoring of lake ice cover (an Essential Climate Variable or ECV), and dates associated with ice phenology (freeze-up, break-up, and ice cover duration) over large areas in an era where ground-based observational networks have nearly vanished in many northern countries. Ice phenology dates as well as dates of maximum and minimum ice cover extent (for lakes that do not form a complete ice cover in winter or do not totally lose their ice cover in summer) are useful for assessing long-term trends and variability in climate, particularly due to their sensitivity to changes in near-surface air temperature. Existing knowledge-driven (threshold-based) retrieval algorithms for lake ice cover mapping that use top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance products do not perform well under lower solar illumination conditions (i.e. large solar zenith angles), resulting in low TOA reflectance. This research assessed the capability of four machine learning classifiers (i.e. multinomial logistic regression, MLR; support vector machine, SVM; random forest, RF; gradient boosting trees, GBT) for mapping lake ice cover, water and cloud cover during both break-up and freeze-up periods using the MODIS/Terra L1B TOA (MOD02) product. The classifiers were trained and validated using samples collected from 17 large lakes across the Northern Hemisphere (Europe and North America); lakes that represent different characteristics with regards to area, latitude, freezing frequency, and ice duration. Following an accuracy assessment using random k-fold cross-validation (k = 100), all machine learning classifiers using a 7-band combination (visible, near-infrared and shortwave-infrared) were found to be able to produce overall classification accuracies above 94%. Both RF and GBT provided overall and class-specific accuracies above 98% and a more visually accurate depiction of lake ice, water and cloud cover. The two tree-based classifiers offered the most robust spatial transferability over the 17 lakes and performed consistently well across ice seasons. However, only RF was relatively insensitive to the choice of the hyperparameters compared to the other three classifiers.

The objectives of this study were 1) to find out whether whitefish can still hatch in the wild in the Archipelago Sea of the southern Gulf of Bothnia, and 2) to define the differences in spawning and hatching times as well as hatching success between areas at different latitudes with diverging temperature loads. To estimate the spawning and hatching temperatures and times of the sea -pawning whitefish, both field and laboratory experiments were carried out in 2007 and 2008. Fertilised whitefish eggs were incubated in spawning areas and at two different temperatures in the laboratory. Naturally-spawned whitefish larvae were also sampled in the vicinity of these test areas and from a more northern reference area. The study indicated that the spawning of whitefish in the northern Baltic Sea starts in late autumn when the day length decreases to approximately 8 h 15 min and the seawater temperature decreases to a level of 7.2 to 3.5 degrees C, regardless of latitude. The hatching period of sea-spawning whitefish larvae is not only dependent on temperature day-degrees but also on the temperature increment. Whitefish larvae hatch in spring after the ice break-up when the water temperature reaches a level of 2 to 4 degrees C. The hatching experiment revealed that some natural reproduction can still take place in the southern parts of the Gulf of Bothnia in the Baltic Sea, specifically the Archipelago Sea and the Bothnian Sea, although whitefish larvae are more frequent in the northern areas.																			1612-166X		978-3-510-47066-2				2013	64						39	55		10.1127/1612-166X/2013/0064-0019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1612-166X/2013/0064-0019													WOS:000328231900004

Effect of sediment and nutrient loading on Lake Tahoe optical conditions and restoration opportunities using a newly developed lake clarity model	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												A quasi-two-dimensional lake clarity model (LCM) was developed to better understand the impacts of pollutant load on lake/reservoir water quality and to provide guidelines for lake/reservoir management and restoration. Though the LCM can be applied to any lake, the model was calibrated and validated using the available detailed data set of Lake Tahoe. The estimated and measured annual average Secchi depths demonstrate a very high degree of agreement with relative error of less than 6%. The sensitivity analysis was performed on those parameter(s)/load(s) found to have a large effect on lake clarity. Loading and settling rates of fine inorganic particles (<16 mu m in diameter) were found to have the largest effect on lake clarity. Atmospheric load adds inorganic particles and nutrients to the surface layer, thus directly affecting lake clarity. Since maximum chlorophyll a concentration is observed in deep water (approximately 50 m below surface) during spring and summer, the Secchi depth (approximately 20-22 m) was found to be relatively insensitive to the change in chlorophyll a concentration in this deep layer. The model was used to simulate different load reduction scenarios to help answer questions such as how much load reduction is needed to restore Lake Tahoe's historic clarity of approximately 30 m and how quickly this change can be achieved? The LCM provides a firsthand scientific solution to managers that the historic clarity can be achieved if total reduction of nutrients and inorganic particles loads will be reduced to approximately 55% from all sources or approximately 75% from urban sources.																			0043-1397	1944-7973				OCT 6	2010	46								W10505	10.1029/2009WR008447	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2009WR008447													WOS:000285520800001

The duration of lake stratification during summer was weather dependent. Concentrations of total CO2 ranged from 2.04 mg l-1 (surface) to 4.02 mg l-1 (bottom during stratification). Nutrient concentrations were generally low and systematic seasonal variation could not be detected with certainty. Vertical distribution of primary production typically showed a distinct maximum followed by a decline with depth. The low production, both per unit area (maximum 60 mg C m-2 day-1) and per unit volume (maximum 14.3 mg C m-3 day-1), and the annual production of 4.7 g C m-2 classified the lake as extremely oligotrophic.																			0105-9327						1982	5	4					420	427																WOS:A1982PP19200010

Mat structure did not vary with temperature. All mats possessed highly ordered layers of airspaces at both the macroscopic and microscopic level, and these appear to be an adaptation to a free-floating growth habit. Upper mat layers supported biomass with elevated carotenoid:chlorophyll alpha ratios and an as yet uncharacterized waxy layer on the dorsal surface. Microscopic examination revealed mats comprised a single Fischerella morphotype, with abundant heterocysts throughout mats at all temperatures. Molecular analysis of mat community structure only partly matched morphological identification. All samples supported greater 16S rDNA-defined diversity than morphology suggested, with a progressive loss in the number of genotypes with increasing temperature. Fischerella-like sequences were recovered from mats occurring at all temperatures, but some mats also yielded Oscillatoria-like sequences, although corresponding phenotypes were not observed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Fischerella-like sequences were most closely affiliated with Fischerella major and the Oscillatoria-like sequences with Oscillatoria amphigranulata.					; Pointing, Stephen/JHT-2500-2023; Smith, Derek/Z-3075-2019	Smith, Gavin/0000-0001-5031-468X; 													0008-4166	1480-3275				JUL	2005	51	7					583	589		10.1139/W05-038	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/W05-038								16175207					WOS:000231985700008

Cercopagis pengoi was absent in both fish stomachs and zooplankton samples in 1997, but by August 1998, its distribution was lake-wide and spines of this organism were present in stomachs of both fish species. Incidence of C. pengoi spines was highest in adult alewives. Spines occurred in 72, 100, and 90% of stomachs in August 1998, August 1999, and October 1999, respectively. Spines were found in 15 and 53% of YOY alewife stomachs in August 1998 and October 1999, respectively. Cercopagis pengoi spines were least common in rainbow smelt stomachs (12% in August 1998 and 6% in October 1999). Low frequency of occurrence in rainbow smelt likely resulted from limited spatial overlap with C. pengoi. No C. pengoi spines were found in alewives < 66 mm total length (TL) which suggests that consumption of C. pengoi by YOY alewife is limited by the long caudal spine. Low consumption of C. pengoi by YOY alewife may explain the remarkably rapid population increase of C. pengoi in Lake Ontario in 1998 in the presence of a strong alewife year class. These results indicate that C. pengoi is a competitor of YOY alewives for zooplankton during the summer but also a potential prey item for larger fish throughout the year and for YOY alewife in the fall.

A greater understanding of these impacts must be developed to inform future adaptation strategies. This study aims to assess potential watershed response to changing climate conditions in southwestern, Ontario, Canada using the fully integrated surface-subsurface model HydroGeoSphere. To account for the uncertainty associated with climate projections and capture a range of possible conditions, a diverse set of meteorological forcings are used, including projections derived from Regional Climate Models (RCMs), a synthetic scenario based on IPCC fifth assessment report predictions, and temporal analogues. Simulation outputs have been compared to assess the potential influence of changing climate on groundwater hydraulic head, surface discharge, and net fluid exchange between surface and subsurface domains. The modelled projections reveal variability in both direction and magnitude of predicted hydrologic change suggesting that simulation outcomes should be interpreted probabilistically, and climate projection uncertainty needs to be characterized. Nonetheless, model outcomes reveal a greater likelihood for a significant reduction in mid-century discharge relative to any significant change in groundwater head or net exchange flux. This study also examines the influence of meteorological input with different temporal resolutions and the importance of RCM lake model coupling for capturing the regional climate influence of the Great Lakes. The latter of these considerations was found to influence spring and summer hydrologic phenomena while the former showed that both daily and monthly normal forcing yield comparable results, if monthly aggregated model outputs are considered. These findings are important for informing the design of future hydrologic investigations especially when working with computationally intensive, large-scale integrated models.					; Parker, Beth/E-6013-2019; Berg, Steven/A-5678-2010; Erler, Andre/AAE-6550-2021	Parker, Beth/0000-0002-5513-7333; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				MAY	2020	584								124682	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124682	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124682													WOS:000527390200061

Multiyear assessment of the sedimentological impacts of the removal of the Munroe Falls Dam on the middle Cuyahoga River, Ohio	CHALLENGES OF DAM REMOVAL AND RIVER RESTORATION	Reviews in Engineering Geology											The 2005 removal of the 3.6-m-high Munroe Falls Dam from the middle Cuyahoga River, Ohio, provided an opportunity to assess dam removal channel-evolution models and to anticipate impacts from additional dam removals on the Cuyahoga River. Preremoval geomorphic and sedimentologic conditions were characterized. Monitoring of the river response to dam removal has continued for 5 yr. The dam removal lowered base level and increased flow velocity upstream of the former dam site. Postremoval, the initial channel response was rapid incision to the predam substrate, followed by rapid lateral erosion of the exposed impoundment fill. Four to nine months after removal, dewatering and vegetation of the exposed impoundment fill greatly reduced the rate of lateral erosion. For 2.5 yr post-removal, sandy bar forms were present upstream of the former dam, and sand was transported under all flow conditions of the year. Subsequently, the bed has become armored with gravel. Downstream of the former dam site, the channel aggraded with sand, causing flow to occupy meander bend chutes that had formerly only been active during high flow. A sandy deltaic feature has accumulated 3.3 km downstream in the impoundment created by the Le Fever Dam. The impacts of the Munroe Falls Dam removal are generally well described by published channel-evolution models with minor exceptions due to local geology and hydrology. The similarities between the Munroe Falls and Le Fever Dam impoundments suggest that this study can aid in understanding the impacts of the possible future removal of the Le Fever Dam.																			0080-2018		978-0-8137-4121-5				2013	21						81	92		10.1130/2013.4121(07)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2013.4121(07)													WOS:000540375600009

Here, we provide a high-resolution record of hydrological evolution in the East Asian monsoon margin region since the last deglaciation. Our synthesis of hydrological records in the East Asian monsoon region reveals that northern and southern China were generally wet during the early Holocene, while two significant drought events occurred in northern China under the suppressive effect of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets. The hydrological pattern of "southern drought-northern floods" developed during the middle Holocene, and the southward withdrawal of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, which was controlled by the inter-hemispheric temperature gradient, along with the enhanced suppression of the East Asian monsoon by the Hadley Circulation, combined to cause synchronous extreme droughts during the mid- to late-Holocene. Since the early Holocene, China has experienced wet conditions with two significant droughts in northern regions, followed by synchronous extreme droughts due to inter-hemispheric temperature gradient and enhanced Hadley Circulation, according to synthesis of a high-resolution hydrological record.

J	Hassani, A				Hassani, A.			Thermal structure and Energy Budget for Alghadir reservoir, Iran	WATER RESOURCES												Knowing the rate of evaporation from surface water resources such as channels and reservoirs is essential for precise management of the water balance. Few detailed evaporation studies exist for small lakes or reservoirs in arid regions of the world. In this study, monthly evaporation was determined by Bowen Ratio Energy Budget technique (BREB) for Alghadir reservoir (Saveh, Iran) from 1995-2007 and compared with class-A pan. Daily data were obtained from IMO (Iran Meteorological Organization) weather station, located near the reservoir, for all of these years. Some variations have been observed on the estimated evaporation of the energy budget at different years, ranging from 151 cm for 1997 to 174 cm for 2006. There is no specific evaporation pattern for all the years, but evaporation rates were low in winter (January and February) and highest during the summer (July and August). However, the times and month of highest evaporation rates varied during the study period. Surveying of reservoir thermal structure showed that, inflow and outflow energy fluxes to this water volume have large variations. In addition, incoming solar shortwave radiation, incoming atmospheric longwave radiation, and longwave atmospheric radiation emitted from the water surface are largest energy fluxes for this small and deep reservoir. Results of this study could explain the importance and sensible contribution of the evaporation rates as a fundamental parameter in the hydrological cycle of reservoirs ecosystem in the arid regions of Iran.																			0097-8078	1608-344X				NOV	2013	40	6					621	630		10.1134/S0097807813060134	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0097807813060134													WOS:000326821600006

A paradox of cooling winter soil surface temperatures in a warming northeastern United States	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Climate model projections indicate that wintertime temperatures will warm and change snowfall patterns in the northeastern U.S. Snow provides insulation for soils from air temperature fluctuations. Therefore, these snowfall changes will have consequences, particularly for soil surface temperatures. Changes in minimum soil surface temperatures were investigated using a heat flow soil temperature model, driven using daily average air temperature and snow depth data. Two scenarios of three coupled atmosphere-ocean circulation models were used to run the soil temperature model. Modeled projections of minimum soil surface temperatures in the northeastern U.S. indicate that warming will occur over the majority of the region over the 2000-2099 period. In contrast, soil surface temperature projections in the northernmost and snowiest regions of the Northeast indicate minimum soil surface temperatures will be colder. In these northern regions, the coldest soil surface temperatures are also projected to occur later in winter, but show little change in other regions. Most trends throughout the Northeast are enhanced using the higher emission scenario A1fi. Changes to snow depth drive the changes in the minimum soil surface temperatures where snow persists during winter, whereas average air temperatures drive changes in the rest of the northeastern U.S. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM.

Multi-sensor detection of spring breakup phenology of Canada's lakes	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The ice phenology of freshwater lakes throughout the Northern Hemisphere has undergone important climateinduced shifts over the past century. In Canada's North, where freshwater lakes and wetlands cover 15 to 40% of the landscape, monitoring ice phenology is vital to understand its impacts on climate, socio-economic, ecological, and hydrological systems. The rapid and dynamic nature of ice phenology events has restricted monitoring efforts to the use of satellite sensors with frequent revisit times (e.g., MODIS, AVHRR), but their low resolution (e.g., > 500 m) limits observations to larger water bodies. However, the increased abundance of highresolution open-access satellite imagery combined with the rise of cloud-computing technologies has provided opportunities to reduce the trade-off between temporal (i.e., revisit time) and spatial (i.e., pixel size) resolution allowing for lake ice monitoring over broad scales. In this study, we present the Open Pixel-based Earth eNgine Ice (OPEN-ICE) algorithm implemented in Google Earth Engine (GEE), which classifies imagery from multiple open-access optical sensors, then combines them to construct dense annual time series of ice-water observations and estimate pixel spring breakup dates at a 30-m resolution. Using Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI, and Sentinel-2 MSI scenes over lakes spanning northern latitudes, we build reference datasets to train decision trees that discriminate between ice, water, and clouds. We combine ice-water classifications from each sensor into annual time series and remove misclassifications with a temporal filter applied using a pixel-wise logistic regression. We then detect the sequence of transition from ice to water in each pixel's time series to estimate the occurrence of breakup each year. We deploy the OPEN-ICE algorithm over all freshwater pixels of Canada for the period of 2013 to 2021. Spring ice phenology events estimated by OPEN-ICE show high accuracy when compared to whole-lake breakup dates measured by the Canadian Ice Service in 105 lakes across 9 years, with mean bias errors of -1.10 and - 0.69 days for breakup start and end, respectively. We apply the OPEN-ICE algorithm to 4000 lakes across Canada and evaluate differences in breakup dates across ecozones and lake sizes. Our new OPEN-ICE tool provides accurate estimates of annual spring breakup events applicable across all boreal and arctic regions to monitor the rapid changes taking place in these vulnerable ecosystems.

Poir. ex Steud. in Lake Burullus, Egypt	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Southern Cattail (Typha domingensis) occurs everywhere in ditches and marshy places in Egypt and is one of the major components of vegetation stands along the shores of Lake Burullus close to the Deltaic Mediterranean coast. In our study, we applied a published Typha model to describe the growth production among the various organs of Southern Cattail in Lake Burullus, one of the Mediterranean eutrophic lakes, in order to answer the following questions: (1) Is the Typha model, originally designed for T. angustifolia and T. latifolia, suited to simulate the growth of Southern Cattail in the south Mediterranean region? and (2) How is biomass production of Southern Cattail distributed among the various plant organs? Above- and below-ground biomass of Southern Cattail was sampled monthly from February 2010 to October 2010 at three sites of Lake Burullus using three randomly distributed quadrats (each of 0.5 m x 0.5 m) at each sampling site. Shoots started to grow in February, reached the maximum biomass of 6327 +/- 441 g DW m(-2) in July, and then rapidly decreased in the fall when they went to senescence stage, thereafter their growth ceased before fully dying off in the winter. The total below-ground biomass reduced to 941 +/- 152 g DW m(-2) in March due to the upward translocation for the initial growth of shoots, gradually increased to a maximum biomass of 2184 +/- 366 g DW m(-2) in July by downward translocation from shoots, then decreased afterwards in the winter to reach 1193 +/- 64 g DW m(-2) in October. Southern Cattail allocated approximately 52% of its total biomass to non-flowering shoots, 19% to flowering shoots, 22.5% to rhizomes and 6.5% to roots. The total above-ground biomass was 2.6 times that of the total below-ground biomass. General trends for above-ground biomass, such as the slow initial growth rate followed by a high growth rate, the timing of peak biomass, and the decline of biomass due to senescence, were successfully reproduced by the model. Many characteristics typical for the below-ground biomass, such as the reduction of rhizome biomass during the early growing season, and the increase in the rhizome biomass during the later period of the season, because of the translocation of materials from current photosynthesis and shoot dry matter, were also reproduced. In general, there was good agreement between the calculated results and field data although simulated results were slightly different from observations for below-ground biomass. Respiration of the above- and below-ground organs consumes a considerable amount of net photosynthetic materials 39% and 7%, respectively. The upward translocation of rhizome resources to form new shoots in February showed 8% to the gross production and the downward translocation afterwards showed a 22% to the gross production. In conclusion, Typha model is well-suited to simulate the growth of Southern Cattail stands in the south Mediterranean region and could be used in wetland management activities to predict the potential growth of Southern Cattail in Egyptian wetlands.

Shrinkage of East Asia Winter Monsoon Associated With Increased ENSO Events Since the Mid-Holocene	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Instrumental records indicate a close relationship between the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) on interannual to decadal time scales. However, few studies have examined possible links between them on centennial/millennial time scales. In Northeast China, modern observations show that the immigration of temperate forest trees such as Pinus (pine) and Quercus (oak) into cold temperate boreal forest is sensitive to changes in winter temperature. Here we present a continuous high-resolution pollen record from Lake Moon in the central part of the Great Khingan Mountain Range, Northeast China. The record reveals increasing contents of Pinus and Quercus pollen after similar to 6.0 ka cal. BP, which may indicate a gradual weakening of the EAWM. It is broadly coupled with an increasing El Nino frequency since the middle Holocene, and we observe a statistically significant correlation between the percentages of Pinus and Quercus and a time series of El Nino events. On the centennial to millennial time scale, the results of wavelet analysis and band-pass filtering show that the occurrence and development of El Nino have also promoted a weaker EAWM after similar to 6.0 ka cal. BP, which is inversely correlated with the variation of the ca. 500-year cycle originated from changes in solar output. These results imply that the climate transition in the mid-Holocene is caused by the change of variations in solar activity and amplified by ocean circulation El Nino-Southern Oscillation to influence the East Asian Monsoon system, especially the EAWM, and finally change the vegetation in Great Khingan Mountain Range.					; Shen, Caiming/F-5687-2012; Wang, Luo/A-1430-2009; Xu, Deke/ABX-7986-2022; Cui, Qiaoyu/G-7801-2014	Wu, Jing/0000-0003-2513-2475; Shen, Caiming/0000-0002-8126-8775; Wang, Luo/0000-0003-2217-8478; Cui, Qiaoyu/0000-0001-9824-3315; Chu, Guoqiang/0000-0001-8256-3947													2169-897X	2169-8996				APR 16	2019	124	7					3839	3848		10.1029/2018JD030148	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JD030148													WOS:000467147400012

One portion of wellfield site selection addressed here includes analysis of ambient groundwater quality and its potential for contamination. This study also addresses the potential impacts of groundwater withdrawals to existing legal users, wetlands, surface waters, and spring flows. A regional groundwater flow model (MODFLOW) was constructed using existing hydrogeologic data from state and federal agencies in order to simulate the existing hydrologic conditions of this karst area and to predict withdrawal impacts. The model was quasi-calibrated by matching potentiometric surface maps and spring flows to within reasonable ranges. Drawdowns in the Floridan and surficial aquifers predicted by the model show minimal impacts to existing legal users and only a 5 percent reduction in the flow at Ichetucknee Springs approximately 21 km (13 mi) away.																					90-5410-867-3				1997							227	233																WOS:A1997BH94W00029

In this study, we developed an explainable machine learning (ML) model that combines the Bayesian optimized (BO) long short-term memory (LSTM) model and the integrated gradients (IG) interpretation method to simulate and explain lake water level variations. In addition, the hydrological drought trends and extreme drought events in Poyang Lake from 1960 to 2022 were identified using the standardized water level index (SWI) and run theory. The analysis revealed that the frequency of hydrological droughts in Poyang Lake increased from 1960 to 2022, especially in the autumn after 2003. By selecting the flows of the catchment and the Yangtze River as the input features, the BO-LSTM model accurately predicted the water level of Poyang Lake. The IG method was then used to interpret the prediction results from three aspects: the importance ranking of the input features, their roles in the seasonal drought trends, and their roles in extreme drought events. The results indicate that (1) the most influential factor affecting the water level of Poyang Lake was the inflow of the Ganjiang River in the catchment. (2) The increase in the lake outflow caused by the Yangtze River's draining effect was the reason for the intensification of the autumn drought in Poyang Lake. (3) The extreme hydrological drought events were primarily caused by low catchment inflows. Overall, this research provides a new approach that balances prediction accuracy with interpretability for predicting and understanding the hydrological processes in large river-connected lakes. Moreover, this method was also applied to the attribution analysis of hydrological drought in Poyang Lake, providing theoretical support for regional water resource management.

Population dynamics of Rana sierrae at Dusy Basin: influence of non-native predators, drought, and restoration potential	ECOSPHERE												The Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog (Rana sierrae) was once an abundant and widely distributed amphibian in California's alpine ranges. Rana sierrae is adapted to high-elevation, fishless habitats. Its adaptions are reflected in a unique life cycle that involves a flexible, extended juvenile phase due to the short growing season typical of its alpine habitat. However, today this species is critically endangered, and most populations have been extirpated from their native range. Here, we present an 18-yr-long demographic study of a R. sierrae population in 15 lakes at Dusy Basin in Kings Canyon National Park. We focused on the period leading up to the arrival of the pathogenic chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), and the subsequent local extinction of R. sierrae. We used N-mixture abundance modeling, which accounts for detection probabilities, to quantify factors affecting frog abundance at different life stages. The abundance of subadult and adult frogs was negatively associated with the presence of introduced trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss and O. aquabonita). Frog abundance in all life stages was positively associated with lake surface area. The propensity of lakes drying correlated negatively with abundance of eggs, subadults, and adults in the following year. Moreover, drought years, characterized by longer summers and less winter snowpack, led to higher rates of lakes drying. Finally, our results suggest that the frequency of such droughts in the region has increased since 1937. Increased frequency or severity of droughts is expected to decrease the value of shallow lakes for Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frogs because these habitats are prone to drying. We discuss our results in terms of future restoration strategies, including reintroduction and probiotic treatment, in this changed and changing ecosystem.

Through the high-frequency monitoring of Tianmuhu Reservoir, a drinking water source for a city with a population of 700,000, we found that odor compounds seasonal dynamics were significantly related to phytoplankton succession, which was controlled by hydrometeorological process. 2-Methylisoborneol (2-MIB) was significantly related to Aphanizomenon sp. (r = 0.51). When the surface water temperature exceeded 12 degrees C, 2-MIB concentration may exceed the odor threshold concentration. With the proliferation of Aphanizomenon sp. in spring, 2-MIB concentration reached 87.22 ng/L. After late spring heavy rain, 2-MIB concentration sharply decreased to 3.19 ng/L. As the temperature increased at the end of the rainy season, Aphanizomenon sp. biomass increased to 2.09 mg/L, and 2-MIB concentration increased to 40.16 ng/L. These results showed that the concentration of odor compounds in shallow layer varied greatly because odor compounds mainly originated from phytoplankton and were susceptible to short-term hydrometeorological processes. However, the concentrations of odor compounds in deep layer were relatively insensitive to short-term weather processes. This study will improve the understanding of seasonal changes in odor compounds at different depths, and provide useful information for reservoir managers to prevent odor problems.

Modelling the evolution of supraglacial lakes on the West Greenland ice-sheet margin	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												We present a model study investigating the summer evolution of supraglacial lakes on the Greenland ice margin. Using a one-dimensional (1-D) model we calculate the surface ablation for a bare ice surface and beneath supraglacial lakes for 30 days in the summers of 1999 and 2001. The surface ablation beneath the lake was enhanced by 110% in 1999 and 170% in 2001 compared with the ablation for bare ice. We then use the results from the 1-D model to further model the vertical and horizontal evolution of the supraglacial lakes, the results of which are compared with satellite images. Within the region of the ice sheet where supraglacial lakes presently occur, the area covered by supraglacial lakes is found to be more or less independent of the summer melt rate but controlled by topography. We therefore predict that, inside this region, the area covered by supraglacial lakes will remain constant even in a warmer climate. However, in a warmer climate, surface melting will occur higher on the ice sheet where small surface slopes favour formation of large supraglacial lakes. Enhanced surface melting beneath such lakes is a hitherto overlooked feedback mechanism related to climate warming.					; Pedersen, Leif/ABA-9687-2020; Luthje, Mikael/AAJ-2186-2021	Greuell, Wouter/0000-0002-3300-5831; Luthje, Mikael/0000-0003-2715-1653; Pedersen, Leif Toudal/0000-0001-7913-6282													0022-1430	1727-5652					2006	52	179					608	618		10.3189/172756506781828386	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/172756506781828386													WOS:000244472100012
J	Kirkup, H; Melles, M; Gore, DB				Kirkup, H; Melles, M; Gore, DB			Late Quaternary environment of southern Windmill Islands, East Antarctica	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Analyses on a sediment core collected from the Windmill Islands, East Antarctica are used to demonstrate that climatic conditions in this region prior to the Last Glacial Maximum were similar to those during the Holocene and that the area was overrun by ice at some stage between 26 kyr Bp and the onset of biogenic sedimentation 11 kyr BP. The 10.9 m long core was taken from a marine inlet (epishelf lake) on Peterson Island and is predominantly a sapropel of Holocene age. Material in the lower part of the core includes a till layer lain down during the last glacial in the region and below this till is material which has been dated to 26 kyr BP. Geochemical analyses conducted on the core demonstrate similarities between the Holocene sequence and the preglacial material. The Holocene sequence shows enhanced biogenic production and periods of open water around 4 kyr BP, suggesting a climatic optimum around that time. A subsequent decline in conditions, probably a colder climate with greater extent of sea ice, is evident from 1 kyr BP to the present. The data support results from ice core studies on nearby Law Dome, which suggest there was a period of warming around 11.5 to 9 kyr BP, that recent summer temperatures are low relative to a few centuries ago, and that increasing winter temperatures are the main contributing factor to a recent overall warming in the region.

J	SHOLKOVITZ, ER; COPLAND, D				SHOLKOVITZ, ER; COPLAND, D			THE CHEMISTRY OF SUSPENDED MATTER IN ESTHWAITE WATER, A BIOLOGICALLY PRODUCTIVE LAKE WITH SEASONALLY ANOXIC HYPOLIMNION	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Ten detailed vertical water column profiles were taken between April and Nov., 1979, in Esthwaite Water (English Lake District), a lake with high biological productivity and a seasonally anoxic hypolimnion. Measurements of the major-element particle composition (organic C, P, S, Si, Al, Ti, K. Mg, Ca, Fe, Mn and Ba) and hydrochemical constituents (temperature, pH, dissolved O2, total suspended load, dissolved Fe, Mn, P and Ba) were carried out. These have revealed new information about the mechanisms and kinetics of biogeochemical cycles in a lake. Pronounced seasonal cycles exist in which large excess concentrations (those unsupported by detrital components) of particulate organic C, Fe, Mn, P, S, Mg, K, Ba and Ca are being generated and lost in situ in the water column (15 m deep). In the epilimnion these elements (excepting Fe and Mn) are incorporated into the organic components of growing phytoplankton during the spring and summer. In the hypolimnion there is a build-up and then a decrease in the excess concentrations of particulate C, P, S, Mg, K, Ba and Ca; this cycle is due to the indirect involvement of these elements with the iron redox cycle. As the hypolimnion becomes anoxic, dissolved ferrous Fe is released from the sediments and large concentrations of excess particulate Fe (III) oxides accumulate; these oxides act as adsorbing substrates for the above mentioned elements. As conditions become more reducing, these same elements are solubilized as the Fe (III) oxide particles are reduced to dissolved ferrous Fe. Adsorption equations are derived from the field data which relate the concentration of excess particulate Fe to those of POC, P, S, Ca, Mg, Ba and K. At the last stages of anoxia (before the lake overturns) large populations of bacteria and the formation of iron sulfide particles control the concentrations of excess particulate C, S, P, Mg, K and Ca.

The period studied covers the spring productivity phase, from January to June 2021, through monthly sampling campaigns in a location where the lake is about 70 m deep (Petit Lac). They have been complemented with samplings in April and June in the lake's deepest point (Grand Lac) and in the main river tributaries. The concentrations of the different species have been measured by a hydride generation - cryotrapping - inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HG-CT-ICP MS/MS) method. Particular attention has been paid to the reliability of the analytical data. When the lake was well mixed, inorganic germanium concentrations were 1.4 ng L-1. Concentration profiles evolved over the season, progressively displaying a typical nutrient-type behaviour, which exactly followed those of silica. Methyl germanium showed conservative behaviour over the entire season with an average concentration of about 0.1 ng L-1. Dimethyl germanium could be detected in some cases but not quantified. Our observations confirm previous studies in oceans but with the difference that, contrary to oceans, inorganic germanium concentrations in the lake largely exceed the concentration of organic species.					; Matousek, Tomas/JCE-3386-2023	Filella, Montserrat/0000-0002-5943-1273; Matousek, Tomas/0000-0002-7603-1773													0883-2927	1872-9134				AUG	2022	143								105352	10.1016/j.apgeochem.2022.105352	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2022.105352		JUN 2022											WOS:000815897700001
J	PACE, ML				PACE, ML			PLANKTONIC CILIATES - THEIR DISTRIBUTION, ABUNDANCE, AND RELATIONSHIP TO MICROBIAL RESOURCES IN A MONOMICTIC LAKE	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The abundance, biomass, vertical distribution and seasonal succession of planktonic ciliates were studied over a 13-mo. period in a small monomictic lake. Measurements made concurrently of bacterial abundance (attached and free), chlorophyll a and pheopigments were analyzed for correlations with the biomass of the major protozoan species and total protozoan biomass. Ciliate community structure varied primarily between periods of winter mixis and summer stratification. Oligotrich, tintinnid and peritrich ciliates dominated the community during mixis (Nov.-March). Vertical distributions tended to be uniform except for some species containing algal symbionts which occurred primarily in the photic zone. A more diverse community occurred during stratification. At this time species either tended to be restricted to the epilimnion or had sharply defined metalimnetic or hypolimnetic maxima. With the development of anoxia in the hypolimnion (June), bacterivorous scuticociliates reached high densities in the metalimnion and upper hypolimnion and dominated the community in terms of density and to a lesser extent biomass. Total protozoan (ciliates and the amoeba Difflugia) density varied over the annual cycle between 1 and 50 .times. 107 m-2 (0.1-189 .times. 103 l-1) while biomass as measured by volume varied between 6-60 mm3 m-2 (61-610 mg dry wt m-2 and 1.57-1260 .mu.m3 l-1). Highest densities occurred from Aug.-Oct. when scuticociliates were abundant, but peak biomass occurred in Nov. with a bloom of the large peritrich Rhabdostyla sp. Total ciliate biomass was correlated only with the concentration of pheopigments, but when the biomass due to Rhabdostyla was subtracted from the total, significant correlations were observed between protozoan biomass and chlorophyll a, pheopigments, attached bacteria and free bacteria. Correlations between the biomass of specific ciliates and microbial parameters, as well as observations of their vertical and seasonal distributions, suggest that concentrations of appropriate food resources are important in determining the abundance of heterotrophic ciliates in the plankton.

Monitoring Spatial Variability and Temporal Dynamics of Phragmites Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Littoral zones of freshwater lakes are exposed to environmental impacts from both terrestrial and aquatic sides, while substantial anthropogenic pressure also affects the high spatial, and temporal variability of the ecotone. In this study, the possibility of monitoring seasonal and spatial changes in reed (Phragmites australis) stands using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based remote sensing technique was examined. Stands in eutrophic and mesotrophic parts of Lake Balaton including not deteriorating (stable) and deteriorating (die-back) patches, were tracked throughout the growing season using a UAV equipped with a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) camera. Photophysiological parameters of P. australis were also measured with amplitude modulated fluorescence. Parameters characterizing the dynamics of seasonal changes in NDVI data were used for phenological comparison of eutrophic and mesotrophic, stable and die-back, terrestrial and aquatic, mowed and not-mowed patches of reed. It was shown that stable Phragmites plants from the eutrophic part of the lake reached specific phenological stages up to 3.5 days earlier than plants from the mesotrophic part of the lake. The phenological changes correlated with trophic (total and nitrate-nitrite nitrogen) and physical (organic C and clay content) properties of the sediment, while only minor relationships with air and water temperature were found. Phenological differences between the stable and die-back stands were even more pronounced, with similar to 34% higher rates of NDVI increase in stable than die-back patches, while the period of NDVI increase was 16 days longer. Aquatic and terrestrial parts of reed stands showed no phenological differences, although intermediate areas (shallow water parts of stands) were found to be less vigorous. Winter mowing of dried Phragmites sped up sprouting and growth of reed in the spring. This study showed that remote sensing-derived photophysiological and phenological variability within and between reed stands may provide valuable early indicators of environmental stress. The flexibility of the method makes it usable for mapping fine-scale temporal variability and spatial zonation within a stand, revealing ecophysiological hotspots that might require particular attention, and obtaining information vital for conservation andmanagement of plants in the littoral zones.

First detection and confirmation of spring viraemia of carp virus in common carp, Cyprinus carpio L., from Hamilton Harbour, Lake Ontario, Canada	JOURNAL OF FISH DISEASES												In June 2006, 150 wild common carp were sampled from Hamilton Harbour, Lake Ontario, Canada. Tissue pools consisting of kidney, spleen and encephalon were screened for viruses as a condition facilitating the export of live carp to France. Cytopathic effect (CPE), indicative of a viral infection, became evident after 8 days of incubation at 15 degrees C. Eighteen of 30 tissue pools (five fish per pool) eventually demonstrated viral CPE. The viral pathogen was initially cultured and isolated on the epithelioma papulosum cyprini cell line and subsequently shown to produce CPE in the fathead minnow and bluegill fin cell lines. Electron microscopy demonstrated the virus to be a rhabdovirus. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay and nucleotide sequence analysis identified the isolate as spring viraemia of carp virus (SVCV). Phylogenetic analysis of a 533 bp region of the glycoprotein gene grouped the Canadian isolate in SVCV genogroup Ia together with isolates from Asia and the USA. Sequence comparisons revealed the Hamilton Harbour, Lake Ontario isolate to be most similar to an isolate obtained from common carp in the Calumet Sag Channel in Illinois in 2003 (98.9% nucleotide identity). This is the first report of the detection of SVCV in Canada.																			0140-7775	1365-2761				NOV	2007	30	11					665	671		10.1111/j.1365-2761.2007.00851.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2761.2007.00851.x								17958610					WOS:000250362400004

Hydrologic and geochemical survey of the lake "Specchio di Venere" (Pantelleria island, Southern Italy)	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												Hydrological and geochemical studies performed on Lake Specchio di Venere on Pantelleria island (Italy) indicate that this endorheic basin has been formed through upwelling of the water table, and that it is continuously fed by the thermal springs situated on its shores. The lake is periodically stratified both thermally and in salinity, albeit this stratification is rather unstable over time, since meteorological events such as strong rain or wind can determine the mixing of its waters. Periodical analyses of the lake water chemistry show large variations of the salt content due to the yearly evaporation-rain dilution cycle. These processes are also responsible for the saline stratification during steady meteorological conditions. The mineralogical characterisation of the bottom sediments shows the almost exclusive presence of neoformation minerals, mainly carbonates, formed in response to the pH gradient between spring- (pH approximate to 6) and lake-waters (pH approximate to 9). Finally, the CO2 partial pressures in the lake water slightly exceeding the atmospheric one, are due to the large amounts of CO2 brought to the lake through the bubbling free gas phase of the thermal springs. Nevertheless the high pH value of the lake water, its small volume and its periodical mixing prevent dangerous built up of this gas.

Here, we investigate four eolian sediment sequences in the Lake Qinghai Basin (LQB), Northeastern Tibetan Plateau (NETP), in the marginal zone of the modern EASM. The results indicate that paleoclimatological interpretation of the color parameters and CaCO3 in eolian sand-paleosol sequence from LQB region are different from the loess-paleosol sequence in Loess Plateau, and a comprehensive analysis that combines lithostratigraphic and other proxy data is required. Changes in the EASM dominated climate change in the NETP, with a gradual increase in moisture from the beginning of the early-Holocene, however the environment was relatively cold and dry with strong regional eolian sand activity. During 8.5-3.3 ka, the intensity of the EASM and effective moisture levels in the LQB reached a peak. Eolian activity was weak and dunes were effectively fixed in place, while pedogenesis processes were enhanced and paleosols developed widely across the region. Moisture levels decreased after 3.3 ka and the dunes were reactivated, eolian activity was enhanced, and there was extensive accumulation of eolian sand and sandy loess. These records show that moisture variability has been controlled by the EASM system in east Asia since at least the Holocene, and has generally responded to changes in northern hemisphere summer insolation with a lag of 3-5 ka, through mechanisms that are modulated by high-latitude ice-volume forcing and large-scale ocean-atmospheric circulation patterns.					; lu, ruijie/AEL-2664-2022; Ding, Zhiyong/IUQ-0526-2023	DING, Zhiyong/0000-0002-6658-7460; 													2572-4517	2572-4525				MAR	2021	36	3							e2020PA004085	10.1029/2020PA004085	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020PA004085													WOS:000635265600001
J	Nikolova, N; Vassilev, S				Nikolova, Nina; Vassilev, Stanislav			VARIABILITY OF SUMMER-TIME PRECIPITATION IN DANUBE PLAIN, BULGARIA	JOURNAL OF THE GEOGRAPHICAL INSTITUTE JOVAN CVIJIC SASA												Over the recent years the climate extremes like as drought and floods become more often and have negative impact on human society. That is way it is very important to know the peculiarities of precipitation variability. The paper investigates precipitation variability during summer time in one of the most important agriculture region in Bulgaria - Danube Plain. The summer-time is determined for the period May - October. The study is based on monthly precipitation total for the period 1961-2005. The precipitation variability is analyzed by comparison with the period 1961-1990, determined by World Meteorological Organization as "contemporary climate". In order to investigate the precipitation variability the various indices lake as Percent of Normal, Rainfall Anomaly Index and Cumulative Anomaly have been calculated. Two wet spells (1865-1983 and 1993-2005) and one dry spell (1983-1993) have been identified. The Kriging interpolation has been applied for presenting special distribution of precipitation variability.

At the time the concentrations of K+ in the groundwater increased. Observations suggest that, if, during an individual loading event, the loading rate of Hydrogen ions (H+) exceeds the rate at which alkalinity is made available through carbonate weathering reactions, increased alumino-silicate alteration can occur. Thus alumino-silicate alteration may occur in groundwater systems with measurable carbonate alkalinity.																			0029-1277						1988	19	2					89	98																WOS:A1988P281700003

Lower Pahranagat Lake: modern analogue for extensive carbonate deposition in paleolakes of the Late Oligocene to Miocene Rainbow Gardens and Horse Spring Formations	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY					6th International Limnogeology Congress (ILIC) of the International-Association-of-Limnogeology (IAL)	JUN 15-19, 2015	Reno, NV					Thick Oligocene-Miocene lacustrine limestones of the Lake Mead region in southern Nevada have few adequate modern analogues that can shed light on their origin. We contend that the Lower Pahranagat Lake (LPAH), a spring-fed, alkaline lake in east-central Nevada, provides such an analogue. Through sediment cores, sampling of the lake margin, and characterization of sediment physical and chemical properties, we show that the LPAH shares a number of lithofacies in common with the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene Rainbow Gardens (RGF) and Miocene Horse Spring Formations (HSF) in the Lake Mead area. These include: stratiform stromatolites, domal stromatolites, reed beds, and intermittently laminated and massive limestones. Oxygen and carbon isotopes from authigenic carbonates support our interpretation in that the LPAH values strongly overlap those of the Oligocene-Miocene units. As a result, we interpret the Oligocene-Miocene RGF and HSF lacustrine carbonates as having been deposited in restricted, alkaline lake basins with high salinity. These basins were not conducive to the ecological success of animals and other, large multicellular organisms and, instead, fostered the growth of significant microbial communities. Lake margins, particularly during RGF deposition, were inhabited by reedy plants and salt tolerant shore grass much as is encountered in the LPAH today. These lakes were likely sourced by springs, but were nonetheless highly evaporative. Some unique aspects of both the LPAH and the Lake Mead region Oligocene-Miocene strata may shed light on the rarity of thick lacustrine carbonates in the rock record. Both of these systems are underlain by thick, Paleozoic carbonate sequences that host the principal aquifers that feed the lakes.

This shift can be represented by a tipping point where a significant change in the state of the ecosystem is observed such as a change from high to low aquatic plants species richness and cover. A total of 100 fish ponds were studied during five years in the Dombes region, France, to determine tipping points in aquatic plant richness and cover using chlorophyll alpha (CHL), water transparency, Total N (TN) and Total P (TP) gradients with two statistical methods. The relationships between tipping points, nutrient loads and yearly variations in weather conditions were also evaluated. Looking at the five years data, tipping points were observed in aquatic plant richness at 6 and 60 mu g/l for CHL, and at 3.90 mg/L for TN concentration; as well as at 70 cm for water transparency, but no tipping point was found with TP. For aquatic plant cover, tipping points were observed at 11 mu g/L. for CHL, 2.42 mg/L for TN, 0.05 mg/L for TP, and at 62 cm for water transparency. These tipping points showed a significant decrease of aquatic plant species richness and cover, linked to the nutrient concentrations which drive the competition between the primary producers phytoplankton and aquatic plants. However, tipping points could vary significantly between years. The inter-annual variability may be due to an early occurrence of phytoplankton blooms in some ponds in a year preventing the establishment of aquatic plants, and thus influencing the value of tipping points. Weather conditions influence the competition between primary producers by impacting chlorophyll a and nutrients concentrations. When weather conditions supported increased nutrient concentrations, the development of phytoplankton and aquatic plants was facilitated and tipping points in aquatic plant richness and cover occurred with relatively high values. Thus, a significant decrease of plant cover and richness occurred at higher level of nutrients compared to the other years. In these cases, aquatic plants dominated over phytoplankton for the spring period, and also often during summer. In conclusion, tipping points observed are mainly linked to the competition between aquatic plants and phytoplankton. In shallow and eutrophic systems like fish ponds where nutrients are not a limiting resource, weather conditions act temporarily during spring as the main regulator of this competition.

Arsenic(III) fuels anoxygenic photosynthesis in hot spring biofilms from Mono Lake, California	SCIENCE												Phylogenetic analysis indicates that microbial arsenic metabolism is ancient and probably extends back to the primordial Earth. In microbial biofilms growing on the rock surfaces of anoxic brine pools fed by hot springs containing arsenite and sulfide at high concentrations, we discovered lightdependent oxidation of arsenite [ As( III)] to arsenate [ As( V)] occurring under anoxic conditions. The communities were composed primarily of Ectothiorhodospira- like purple bacteria or Oscillatoria- like cyanobacteria. A pure culture of a photosynthetic bacterium grew as a photoautotroph when As( III) was used as the sole photosynthetic electron donor. The strain contained genes encoding a putative As( V) reductase but no detectable homologs of the As( III) oxidase genes of aerobic chemolithotrophs, suggesting a reverse functionality for the reductase. Production of As( V) by anoxygenic photosynthesis probably opened niches for primordial Earth's first As( V)- respiring prokaryotes.

One experiment compared three different transportation methods. When water-hardened eggs were transported in bags containing water equal in Volume to egg volume, survival rates of the eggs to both the eyed and swim-up stages of development were highest at 73.9% and 69.0%, respectively. Eggs transported in moist air conditions had a mean survival of 60.3% to the eyed stage and 55.7% to swim-up. Transportation of separate gametes before fertilization and water hardening produced only a 15.7% survival to the eyed stage. A second experiment directly examined the effects of egg transportation. No differences in survival to the eyed stage of development were observed between water-hardened eggs transported in bags containing water versus water-hardened eggs not transported. Transportation of inland fall chinook salmon eggs from Lake Oahe in coolers containing water volumes equal to egg Volumes is recommended.																			1522-2055					JAN	1999	61	1					27	33		10.1577/1548-8454(1999)061<0027:TIOIFC>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8454(1999)061<0027:TIOIFC>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000082488700005

Relatively high T-h values in samples from shallow depths indicate erosion of about 200 m of caldera fill since deposition of hydrothermal minerals at shallow depths in the Sulphur Springs hydrothermal system, accompanied by a descent in the water table of the liquid-dominated reservoir. For samples collected below the current water level of the well, the minimum values of homogenization temperature (T-h) fit the present thermal profile, whereas minimum T-h values of samples from above the water level are several tens of degrees higher than the present thermal profile and fit a paleo-thermal profile following the boiling point curve for pure water, as adjusted to 92 degrees C at 20 m below the present land surface. This is attributed to development of an evolving vapor zone that formed subsequent to a sudden drop in the water table of the liquid-dominated reservoir. We suggest that these events were caused by the drainage of an intracaldera lake when the southwestern wall of the caldera was breached about 0.5 Ma. This model indicates that vapor zones above major liquid-dominated geothermal reservoirs can be formed due to dramatic changes in geohydrology and not just from simple boiling.																			0377-0273					AUG	1995	67	1-3					161	169		10.1016/0377-0273(94)00101-L	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0377-0273(94)00101-L													WOS:A1995RV91000010

We examine Arctic climate responses to insolation intensity as well as remnant ice sheets through atmosphere-ocean-vegetation feedback quantitatively. During periods when Northern Hemisphere ice sheets remain, Arctic sea ice maintains a large extent in summer, and annual mean surface air temperatures are low enough to outweigh the warming expected from summer insolation intensity and greenhouse gases alone. This indicates that glacial ice sheets, due to their high albedo and their role as a heat sink, suppress the accumulation of heat in the Arctic Ocean in summer and the associated warming feedback. The results suggest a need to consider the history of remnant ice sheets and the duration of ice-free periods to explain different Arctic climate responses within and between interglacials.

This geophysical campaign was a multinational academic effort among the Universities of Vienna, Budapest, Bremen, and Southampton. Lake Neusiedl is an exceptionally shallow lake, with an average water depth of only approximately 1.4 m. Although high-resolution single-channel seismic reflection data have been collected before on this lake, the multichannel seismic acquisition, towing a 60 m cable and an air gun behind a retrofitted ferry boat, was a completely new approach in this area. The quality of the multichannel data turned out to be exceptionally good; i.e., the high-frequency data illuminated the subsurface of the lake for the first time, down to the pre-Cenozoic basement at approximately 600 m depth. The most prominent findings of the new data include (1) a consistent southeasterly dip of erosionally truncated Late Miocene (Pan-nonian) sediments beneath a very thin Holocene mud layer, (2) the presence of major throughgoing fault systems (including a positive flower structure), (3) at least one Pannonian progradational sequence defined by seismic clinoforms indicating a paleowater depth of approximately 40-80 m, (4) flat spots in several locations of the study area corresponding to possibly biogenic gas in a few hundred meters depth beneath the lake, (5) vertical data wipeouts, which are interpreted as gas chimneys reaching the lake bottom, and (6) definition of the pre-Cenozoic basement. Interestingly, the gas chimneys are interpreted to correspond to the well-known gas seeps ("Kochbrunnen") in Lake Neusiedl, which were originally described as subaqueous water springs on the lake floor responsible for ice-free areas in the lake ice cover during winter.

J	Ursenbacher, S; Stötter, T; Heiri, O				Ursenbacher, Stefan; Stoetter, Tabea; Heiri, Oliver			Chitinous aquatic invertebrate assemblages in Quaternary lake sediments as indicators of past deepwater oxygen concentration	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Chitinous aquatic invertebrate remains are abundant in late Quaternary lake sediment sequences. However, for standard analysis of invertebrate indicator groups usually only the remains of one particular invertebrate group (e.g. water fleas, midges) are systematically isolated from the sediments and analysed numerically. In a calibration study focusing on surface sediment samples from 36 small Swiss lakes, we show that the abundances of other chitinous aquatic invertebrate remains in samples prepared for chironomid analysis provide important information on in-lake oxygen conditions when assessed relative to and together with the overall number of chironomid remains. Our results show that particularly high abundances of chironomid and chaoborid remains are indicative for lakes with high and low deepwater oxygen concentrations, respectively, but that also the remains of other invertebrate groups such as Ceriodaphnia ephippia and Plumatella statoblasts tend to be more abundant in warm, stably stratified and anoxic lakes. Direct gradient analyses of the isolated invertebrate assemblages indicate that deepwater oxygen concentration during late summer is the strongest predictor for assemblage changes in our dataset, followed by variables representing temperature conditions (summer surface water temperature, altitude), summer stratification stability (temperature difference between surface and deepwater layers), water depth and the relative volume of the late summer hypoxic water layer. We show, based on invertebrate assemblages in a Lateglacial sediment sequence from Rotsee, Switzerland, that our new calibration data can provide information on past changes in deepwater oxygen availability from late Quaternary lake sediment sequences, when fossil invertebrate assemblages are added as passive samples to ordinations of the surface sediment calibration data. This provides a new approach for developing assessments of past changes in deepwater oxygen concentrations from late Quaternary sediment samples prepared for chironomid analysis. Such assessments can provide important supplementary information for e.g. interpreting palaeotemperature reconstructions based on chironomid remains. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Submerged macrophyte and phytoplankton components of eutrophic, shallow lakes have frequently undergone dynamic changes in composition and abundance with important consequences for lake functioning and stability. However, because of a paucity of long-term survey data, we know little regarding the nature, direction and sequencing of such changes over decadal-centennial or longer timescales. 2. To circumvent this problem, we analysed multiple (n = 5) chronologically correlated sediment cores for plant macro-remains and a single core for pollen and diatoms from one small, shallow, English lake (Felbrigg Hall Lake, Norfolk, U.K.), documenting 250 years of change to macrophyte and algal communities. 3. All five cores showed broadly similar stratigraphic changes in macrophyte remains with three distinct phases of macrophyte development: Myriophyllum-Chara-Potamogeton (c. pre-1900), to Ceratophyllum-Chara-Potamogeton (c. 1900-1960) and finally to Zannichellia-Potamogeton (c. post-1960). Macrophyte species richness declined from at least 10 species pre-1900 to just four species at the present day. Additionally, in the final Zannichellia-Potamogeton phase, a directional shift between epi-benthic and phytoplankton-based primary production was indicated by the diatom data. 4. Based on macrophyte-seasonality relationships established for the region, concomitant with the final shift to Zannichellia-Potamogeton, we infer a reduction in the seasonal duration of plant dominance (plant-covered period). Furthermore, we hypothesise that this change in species composition resulted in a situation whereby macrophyte populations were seasonally 'sandwiched' between two phytoplankton peaks in spring and late summer as observed in the contemporary lake. 5. We suggest that eutrophication-induced reductions in macrophyte species richness, especially if the number of plant-seasonal strategies is reduced, may constrict the plant growing season. In turn, this may render a shallow lake increasingly vulnerable to seasonal invasions of phytoplankton resulting in further species losses in the plant community. Thus, as part of a slow (over perhaps 10-100s of years) and self-perpetuating process, macrophytes may be gradually pushed out by phytoplankton without the need for a perturbation as required in the alternative stable states model of plant loss.

Identifying the temporal and spatial patterns (pathways) of these monsoonal events during the Late Holocene to today has been a matter of debate amongst the scientific community. Here we show that the distribution patterns of the cosmogenic isotope Be-10 and oceanic I-127 in the topsoil across China exhibit imprints of the main ASM pathways. Our results indicate the monsoon pathway pattern persisted for several millennia or more and suggest a strong bond between Be-10 and water vapor transport patterns. Our data also reveal a(127)I distribution pattern controlled by the ASM pathways, rather than proximity to the sea or bedrock weathering. The persistent pathway of the ASM during the late Holocene, together with higher than average global soil iodine concentration, may have further strengthened the development of civilizations in this region of the world through reduction of iodine deficiency related diseases.

In the present study, Holocene precipitation and temperature changes were quantitatively reconstructed from a pollen record from the sediments of Tianchi Crater Lake in northeastern China using a plant functional type-modern analogue technique (PFT-MAT). The reconstructed precipitation record indicates a gradual increase during the early to mid-Holocene and a HSMM at similar to 5500-3100 cal yr BP, while the temperature record exhibits a divergent pattern with a marked rise in the early Holocene and a decline thereafter. The trend of reconstructed precipitation is consistent with that from other pollen records in northeastern China, confirming the relatively late occurrence of the HSMM in the region. However, differences in the onset of the HSMM within northeastern China are also evident. No single factor appears to be responsible for the late occurrence of the HSMM in northeastern China, pointing to a potentially complex forcing mechanism of regional rainfall in the East Asian monsoon region. We suggest that further studies are needed to understand the spatiotemporal pattern of the HSMM in the region.

Typical characteristics of Shagawa Lake were extensive summer blue-green algal blooms (Anabaena and Aphanizomenon), anaerobic hypolimnion and large and rapid fluctuations in chemical constituents. In contrast, oligotrophic Burntside Lake was characterized by low numbers of algae (predominately diatoms and greens), aerobic hypolimnion and small changes in chemical constituents. Chlorophyll a concentrations in Shagawa Lake typically reached 50-60 .mu.g/l while in Burntside Lake the maximum observed was 6 .mu.g/l. Predominant benthic fauna in Shagawa Lake was Chaoborus at densities up to 28 .times. 103 organisms/m2, while in Burntside Lake Amphipoda predominated during the summer as a maximum density of about 1300 organisms/m2. Both inorganic nitrogen (IN) and orthophosphate phosphorus (OP) in Shagawa Lake were depleted to undetectable levels in the epilimnion during the summer. In the epilimnion of Burntside Lake OP was at the detectable limit throughout most of the summer and IN was depleted to undetectable levels. The thermocline in Burntside Lake was relatively stable while in Shagawa Lake it was readily destroyed by passing cold fronts and strong winds, allowing nutrient-rich hypolimnetic water to mix with the nutrient-limited epilimnetic water which helped to sustain the algal biomass.																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1976	96	1					160	178		10.2307/2424575	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2424575													WOS:A1976CD45000012
J	Rzepecki, M				Rzepecki, M			Bottom sediments in a humic lake with artificially increased calcium content: sink or source for phosphorus?	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION					International Symposium on the Interactions Between Sediments and Water	SEP 22-26, 1996	BAVENO, ITALY					Lake Flosek (northeastern part of Poland) is a small shallow and without overflow lake which has been limed in 1970. The concentration of Ca was increased from 3-4 mg L-1 to 17 mg L-1 in the water and from 0.2-0.3% dry weight to 0.9-1.7% dry weight in sediments (5 cm upper layer) due to CaCO3 addition to the lake. In the spring-summer seasons of 1992 and 1993, an experimental study was conducted in Lake Flosek to assess the capacity of bottom sediments to uptake and release mineral phosphorus. The rate of phosphorus exchange be tween sediments and near-bottom water was experimentally measured under conditions of high (100%), and of reduced (10%) oxygen saturation in near-bottom water. To determine the component of sediments responsible for the uptake of most phosphorus, the proportions of phosphorus forms in sediments were analysed. Sediments of Lake Flosek showed a slight tendency to release phosphates. The rate of this process was similar under high (100%) and low (10%) oxygen saturations ranging from -0.161 to + 0.200 mg P m(-2) d(-1). This is much lower (by 1-2 orders of magnitude) than reported from other harmonic, non-humic lakes. In the total phosphorus pool, the highest content of phosphorus was found in the organic and residual phosphorus fractions (over 70% of the total phosphorus in sediments). The largest part of the readily extractable phosphorus was found in the fraction bound to Al and humic substances (41%). Both these fractions determine a weak exchange of phosphorus between sediments and water. No difference in P-release related to P-fraction compound was found in the cores taken from three sites in the lake.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				OCT	1997	99	1-4					457	464		10.1007/BF02406885	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02406885													WOS:A1997XW68200048

Life history, distribution, and production of Diporeia near the Keweenaw Peninsula Lake Superior	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Benthic amphipods are a keystone species in food webs of marine and freshwater systems. The amphipod in the phylogroup Diporeia found in the Great Lakes has historically been a dominant member of the benthic community and is critical to the fisheries food web. This study investigates water depth, life stage, sex, production, lipid content, and gut fullness as influences and outcomes of Diporeia distribution in Lake Superior. Samples were collected at 2- to 3-week intervals from May to October 2003 from ten stations along one transect in-Lake Superior near the Keweenaw Peninsula of Michigan to determine seasonal trends in abundance and condition. Diporeia comprised, on average, 52% of the benthic macroinvertebrate community. Abundance and productivity of Diporeia is greatest within the slope region (depths of 30 to 125 m) with estimated biomass and annual P/B (production/biomass) values of 0.57 and 0.73 g/m(2) for this habitat. Young-of-the-year Diporeia were the most abundant life stage in the shelf in the spring while adults were most abundant in the slope and profundal regions in fall. The greatest mean percent gut fullness occurred in September and October while the least full and empty gut occurrences were observed in June and July. The slope of the length-weight relationship for Diporeia in Lake Superior is lower (less biomass per unit length) than that observed for lakes Huron, Michigan, and Ontario. The greatest lipid content was 41% DW in July at 20 m with the overall average lipid content of Diporeia from Lake Superior in 2003 at 32% with a decline observed from September to October. The description of Diporeia abundance, distribution, and life history presented here for Lake Superior, and compared with that of other Great Lakes, will be of use in support of studies of lower food web bioenergetics.

Differences in forest composition following two periods of settlement by pre-Columbian Native Americans	VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY												Temperate broadleaf forests in eastern North America are diverse ecosystems whose vegetation composition has shifted over the last several millennia in response to climatic and human drivers. Yet, detailed records of long-term changes in vegetation composition and diversity in response to known periods of human activity, particularly multiple distinct periods of human activity at the same site, are still relatively sparse. In this study, we examine a sediment record from Avery Lake, Illinois, USA, using multiple metrics derived from pollen data to infer vegetation composition and diversity over the last 3,000 years. This 3,000-year history encompasses the Baumer (300 bce-300 ce) and Mississippian settlements (1150-1450 ce) at Kincaid Mounds (adjacent to Avery Lake), and captures differences in the impact that these groups had on vegetation composition. Both groups actively cleared the local landscape for settlement and horticultural/agricultural purposes. Given the persistence of fire-tolerant Quercus in conjunction with declines in other tree taxa, this clearing likely occurred through the use of fire. We also apply a self-organized mapping technique to the multivariate pollen assemblages to identify similarities and differences in vegetation composition across time. Those results suggest that the vegetation surrounding Avery Lake was compositionally similar before and after the Baumer settlement, but compositionally different after the Mississippian settlement. The end of the Mississippian settlement occurred simultaneously with a regional shift in moisture characterized by drier summers and wetter winters associated with the Little Ice Age (1250-1850 ce), which likely prevented this ecosystem from returning to its pre-Mississippian composition.

J	Jung, YT; Park, SE; Kim, HC				Jung, Yoon Taek; Park, Sang-Eun; Kim, Hyun-Cheol			Observation of spatial and temporal patterns of seasonal ground deformation in central Yakutia using time series InSAR data in the freezing season	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The seasonal freeze/thaw variations of the active layer cause seasonal ground deformation, such as thaw subsidence in summer and frost heave in winter due to the cyclic phase changes of soil water. The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing, especially interferometric SAR (InSAR) techniques, has been proven to be a very useful tool for observing surface displacements of permafrost environments. Most previous studies on seasonal InSAR displacement have been concentrated in several study sites in the Arctic tundra regions. The objective of this study is to extend the InSAR analysis of seasonal ground deformations to boreal forest regions, where monitoring ground deformation is particularly important in terms of better understanding active layer dynamics under various ecological and geological conditions. In this study, we presented a strategy to analyze the time series SAR data in the freezing season to estimate the differential phase for seasonal ground deformation while overcoming the problem of coherence losses due to the rapid growth of vegetation during the short growing season. We applied the SBAS-based InSAR processing method to Sentinel-1 SAR in the central Yakutian lowlands, where boreal forests and thermokarst landforms are widely distributed, and retrieved frost-related displacement signals successfully. In addition to the magnitude of ground deformation in the freezing season, we further examined the temporal deformation pattern related to the progression of the freezing front in the soil during active freezing. Based on the Stefan solution, we proposed a piecewise linear model for the time series deformation. The proposed model divides the time series displacement according to the progression of freezing into three linear segments, and the slope parameter of each linear model can be interpreted as indicating the hydrological characteristics of the upper, middle, and lower parts of the soil. The results for the Yakutian lowlands illustrated the potential of SAR remote sensing to observe and quantify spatial details of the thermal and hydrological properties inside the active layer soil even in highly vegetated subarctic boreal forest areas.

Coliform bacteria isolated from recreational lakes carry class 1 and class 2 integrons and virulence-associated genes	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY												AimsTo characterize the integron-harbouring Gram-negative bacteria in recreational lakes, with focus on the genetic content of integrons, antimicrobial resistance profiles and virulence-associated genes. Methods and ResultsThe presence and structure of integrons in coliform bacteria isolated from the water of four recreational lakes located in Pozna, Poland, was determined by PCR method. Antimicrobial resistance testing was done by disc diffusion method. Virulence-associated genes in integron-bearing Escherichia coli isolates were detected by PCR. A total of 155 integron-bearing strains of coliform bacteria were cultured. Sequence analysis showed the presence of dfrA7, aadA1, dfrA1-aadA1, dfrA17-aadA5 and dfrA12-orfF-aadA2 gene cassette arrays in class 1 integrons and dfrA1-sat2-aadA1 in class 2 integrons. Higher frequency of integron-positive bacteria and higher antimicrobial resistance ranges were noted in colder months (January and November) compared with spring and summer months. The integron-harbouring E.coli carried up to nine virulence-associated genes, with the highest frequency of kpsMT (846%) and traT (783%), coding for group 2 capsule and determining human serum resistance respectively. ConclusionsIntegron-bearing multidrug resistant coliform bacteria carrying virulence genes are present in waters of recreational lakes. Significance and Impact of the StudyThis study presents antimicrobial resistance and virulence-associated genes in integron-bearing coliform bacteria present in the waters of recreational lakes, which showed that multidrug resistant bacteria with virulence traits might pose a threat to public health. Moreover, the presence of genes typical for enterotoxigenic and Shiga toxin-producing E.coli is a concern.

J	Buck, U; Babenzien, HD; Zwirnmann, E				Buck, Ulrike; Babenzien, Hans-Dietrich; Zwirnmann, Elke			Extracellular peroxidase activity in an experimentally divided lake (Grosse Fuchskuhle, northern Germany)	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Extracellular peroxidases act on aromatic compounds such as humic substances resulting in the formation of unstable radicals. Most organisms that are known to produce extracellular peroxidases are terrestrial, e.g. the wood-rotting fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium and the Actinobacterium Streptomyces viridosporus. Only few studies focus on the action of these enzymes in the aquatic environment. In this study, the activities of extracellular peroxidases in 2 distinct compartments of the experimentally divided Lake Grosse Fuchskuhle, Germany (an acidic humic rich compartment and an almost neutral eutrophic compartment) and in the catchment area were investigated. Additionally, the effects of pH on extracellular peroxidase activity and of the size fractions of water samples associated with extracellular peroxidase activity were determined. Enzyme activity and the characterisation of the enzymes were assayed by oxididation of 2, 2'-azino-di-(3-ethyl-benzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS). In the humic rich compartment, extracellular peroxidase activity was (except for 1 month) significantly higher than in the eutrophic compartment, with highest activities during fall and winter. In contrast, no peroxidase activity was detected in the catchment area. The pH optimum of extracellular peroxidases was pH 3, and highest activity was detected in the 10 kDa-0.2 mu m molecular weight class. Thus we documented the occurrence of extracelluar peroxidases in Lake GroBe Fuchskuhle and suggest that these enzymes are involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds such as humic substances.																			0948-3055	1616-1564				APR 24	2008	51	1					97	103		10.3354/ame01188	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame01188													WOS:000256190600010
J	Griffiths, HI; Schwalb, A; Stevens, LR				Griffiths, HI; Schwalb, A; Stevens, LR			Environmental change in southwestern Iran: the Holocene ostracod fauna of Lake Mirabad	HOLOCENE												Ostracod faunal data are presented from a sediment core taken from extant Iranian Lake Mirabad. Ostracod faunal successions indicate relatively high concentrations of mainly nektonic taxa between c. 9265 and 6505 cal. C-14 yr BP, followed by lower concentrations of mainly benthic forms after 6505 cal.BP. These results suggest that lake levels were low during the early Holocene, and that water levels rose during mid-Holocene times, notably after c. 4048 cal. C-14 yr BP. These findings confirm and consolidate palaeoclimatic inferences based on previously published pollen diagrams from the region, but indicate an apparent timelag between the early to mid-Holocene forest advance and increased lake levels. This may be explained by changes in precipitation/evaporation ratios; the increase in winter precipitation was sufficient to allow the expansion of arboreal vegetation, but summer evaporation remained high. This also gives support to the idea that the delayed readvance of forests in eastern Turkey and western Iran in the early Holocene was hampered by dry conditions in the continental interior. The apparently out-of-phase response observed between the palaeoclimate record from Lake Mirabad and from other sites in northern Africa, the eastern Mediterranean and Arabia may be explained by shifting atmospheric circulation patterns and varying amplitudes of precipitation as a consequence of changes in insolation. To promote further ostracod palaeoecological research in the Near East, a checklist of non-marine Ostracoda known from modem Iran is presented as an appendix.

However, the spatiotemporal characteristics and underlying mechanisms of the events remain insufficiently understood. This study identifies two distinct synoptic patterns that govern summer regional extreme precipitation events (REPEs) over the ITP from 1979 to 2020. The first pattern (REPE1, constituting 50.5% of the events) is characterized by a Rossby wave train inducing a negative-positive-negative geopotential height anomaly, accompanied by moisture convergence via southwesterlies and convective updrafts over the southeastern ITP. Conversely, the second pattern (REPE2, 49.5%) features a persistent positive-negative-positive geopotential height anomaly associated with mid-to-high latitude circulation, along with moisture convergence driven by southeasterlies and ascending motions over the southwestern ITP. Moreover, both REPE1 and REPE2 have exhibited increased frequencies post-2010, with REPE2 showing a more pronounced upward trend. The rising frequencies of REPE1 and REPE2 have contributed significantly to the increase in extreme precipitation over the ITP in recent decades.

J	Zhang, SY; Zeng, G; Yang, XY; Wang, TJ				Zhang, Shiyue; Zeng, Gang; Yang, Xiaoye; Wang, Tijian			Opposite trends of cold surges over South China Sea and Philippines Sea and their different impacts on PM2.5 in eastern China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The variations in cold surge (CS) path can cause significant impacts on air pollution in the area it passes through. This study investigates impacts of CSs over South China Sea (CSSCS) and Philippine Sea (CSPHS) on PM2.5 concentrations in eastern China (PCEC) and their underlying mechanisms from 1979 to 2021. It was revealed that the CSSCS is accompanied by the continental high-pressure over East Asia and shows an upward trend. CSPHS is mainly affected by both the continental high-pressure over East Asia and the East Asian Trough over the Sea of Japan, showing a significant downward trend. Such difference in circulation anomalies is related to the different paths of the two types of CSs. Both observation and simulations indicate that more (less) Ural blocking in winter would lead to the cold air originating from the regions over Lake Baikal (Caspian Sea) to invade southward (eastward) along the northern (northwestern) path, resulting in more frequent CSSCS (CSPHS) and increased (decreased) winter averaged PCEC due to the anticyclonic (cyclonic) anomalies over eastern China. Such variations in winter averaged PCEC masked the synoptic signals that PCEC would decrease (increase) during CSSCS (CSPHS) outbreaks. Therefore, the increased frequency of atmospheric blocking over Ural Mountains in recent years has still played a worsening role in the intensification of PCEC.					; Zeng, Gang/IWM-2172-2023; Yang, Xiaoye/KAM-5012-2024	Zhang, Shiyue/0009-0001-5313-9802; Yang, Xiaoye/0000-0001-5138-8445													0048-9697	1879-1026				JAN 15	2024	908								168454	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168454	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168454		NOV 2023						37956853					WOS:001165178200001

Under-ice thermal stratification dynamics of a large, deep lake revealed by high-frequency data	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We measured under-ice thermal stratification from before ice-on through after ice-off in Lake Sunapee, New Hampshire, a large, deep, north temperate lake, using a high-frequency monitoring buoy in the winter season of 2007-2008 to quantify how lake thermal stratification varies throughout the under-ice season. We examined potential drivers of variation in under-ice stability, identified diel-scale patterns in under-ice stratification, and used this dataset to test the hypothesis that there are two distinct under-ice phases driven by heat flux from the sediment followed by increased solar radiation as winter progresses. High-frequency measurements demonstrated that only a small fraction of the under-ice period exhibited the traditional inverse stratification previously thought to prevail, based on temporally discrete under-ice temperature profiles. Local short-term weather conditions altered under-ice conditions throughout the ice season with brief periods of snow melt, resulting in several days of disrupted thermal stratification. Our data indicate that thermal structure under the ice in Lake Sunapee is dynamic, and in contrast to smaller, shallower lakes, may be categorized in three, not two, distinct phases. As the under-ice season continues to become shorter due to climate change, under-ice thermal stratification in lakes will likely decrease further.					; Carey, Cayelan/D-4874-2016	Richardson, David/0000-0001-9374-9624; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2015	60	2					347	359		10.1002/lno.10014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10014													WOS:000351126500001

Research on its reproductive mechanisms and capabilities may be valuable not only in predicting its further spread, bur also in investigating basic mechanisms of reproduction and development and in developing new strategies to mitigate its impact. Since zebra mussels are dioecious and fertilization occurs externally, coordinated maturations spawning, and other mechanisms have evolved to increase the probability of successful fertilization. The zebra mussel undergoes an annual cycle or gonadal growth and gamete maturation, culminating in one or more spawning events in late spring or early summer. Temperature, rates of temperature change, food availability, and effects of neighboring mussels seem to be critical variables that determine reproductive responses. Serotonin is a biogenic amine which is implicated in spawning behavior and call reliably trigger spawning. Serotonin is present in the gonad in neural varicosities that encircle groups of gametes, and specific serotonergic ligands can mimic or block spawning caused by serotonin. In females, serotonin reinitiates meiosis causing maturation from prophase. I to metaphase I prior to spawning. Spawned oocytes contain substances that are species specific sperm chemoattractants. The sequence of binding, entry, and subsequent nuclear movements have been observed with fluorescence and scanning microscopy. Despite their negative ecological and economic impacts, zebra mussels have also provided a new and easily obtainable resource for studies of reproductive mechanisms.

Seasonal and Spatial Variations in the Number of Ammonifying and Denitrifying Bacteria in Communities of Plankton and Epilithon from the Littoral Zone of Lake Baikal	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												We present the results of a study on the number of indicator bacterial groups of the nitrogen cycle in plankton and epilithon of the littoral zone of Lake Baikal in the spring and autumn of 2017-2019. The number of ammonifying bacteria (AB) varied from 25 to 6.0 x 10(5) cells/mL in lake waters and from 3.5 x 10(3) to 9.5 x 10(6) cells/cm(2) in epilithic biofilms. Stations exposed to anthropogenic impact showed a high number of AB as evidence of the active mineralization of nitrogen-containing organic compounds. The maximum number of AB in the water column and the biofilms from stony substrates was detected in June 2017 in the water area of the town of Severobaikalsk. The average number of AB in the water column over the 3-year period was 5.0 +/- 2.8 x 10(2) cells/mL in June and 6.0 +/- 1.3 x 10(2) cells/mL in September. In epilithic biofilms, it was an order of magnitude lower in June than in September: 3.4 +/- 1.2 x 10(4) cells/cm(2) and 2.6 +/- 1.4 x 10(5) cells/cm(2), respectively. The number of denitrifying bacteria (DB) in water and epilithic biofilms varied from 0 to 60 cells/mL and 6 to 2.5 x 10(3) cells/cm(2), respectively. Throughout the research period, the highest number of DB in the epilithon was detected in June at the station near Cape Elokhin. The average number of DB over the 3-year period was 13 +/- 4 cells/mL in June and 7 +/- 6 cells/mL in September in the water column, 7.9 +/- 2.4 x 10(2) cells/cm(2) in June and 4.8 +/- 0.5 x 10(2)cells/cm(2) in September in epilithic biofilms. The number of planktonic AB positively correlates with the concentration of ammonium ions; the number of DB directly depends on the nitrate concentration and inversely depends on nitrites at some stations.

However, the exploration and development of these resources are hindered due to an incomplete understanding of their nature and origin. Here we present results from a comprehensive study on the hydrochemical parameters, whole-rock geochemistry, H-O isotopes, and Li concentrations in surface brine, river water, geothermal springs, and associated rocks from two representative lithium-enriched salt lakes, the Laguo Co (LGC) and Cangmu Co (CMC) in Tibet to understand the genetic mechanisms. Our water-salt balance calculations and H-O isotopic analysis reveal that Li in LGC and CMC primarily originates from the Suomei Zangbo (SMZB, -91%) and Donglong Zangbo (DLZB, -75%) rivers, respectively. It is estimated that the LGC and CMC took a minimum of 6.0 ka and 3.0 ka to accumulate their current lithium resources, respectively. The distinct geological characteristics reflect evolutionary differences between the two lakes, suggesting diverse lithium sources and enrichment processes. The high lithium ion concentration and light lithium isotope composition in the SMZB river waters indicate the genetic relationship with lithium-enriched geothermal springs in the Tibetan Plateau. Our results suggest that lithium in the LGC originates from lithium-enriched geothermal springs and is primarily supplied through the small-scale SMZB river. In contrast, the formation and evolution of CMC are influenced by the northern Lunggar rifts, receiving a prolonged and stable input from the DLZB, resulting in high lithium concentrations and isotopic values. The absence of lithium-enriched geothermal springs and the prevalence of silicate rocks in the CMC catchment suggest that lithium may be sourced from the weathering of silicate rocks, such as granitic pegmatite veins containing lithium-rich beryl, widely distributed in the upstream area of DLZB. The forward modeling approach, quantifying the contribution fractions of different reservoirs (atmospheric precipitation, silicate, carbonate, and evaporite), indicates that the distinct lithium concentrations in the mainstream (>1 mg/L) and tributaries (<0.1 mg/L) are positively correlated with the ratio of silicate contributions to carbonate contributions, suggesting that dissolved lithium in river waters primarily originates from the weathering and dissolution of silicate rocks. The distinct sources and enrichment mechanisms of lithium in these two salt lakes are attributed to various evolutionary processes, topographical features, hydrological factors, fundamental geological settings, and tectonic histories, despite their spatial proximity.

J	Alway, FJ; Kittredge, J; Methley, WJ				Alway, FJ; Kittredge, J; Methley, WJ			Composition of the forest floor layers under different forest types on the same soil type	SOIL SCIENCE												Litter, duff, leafmold, and freshly fallen leaves were collected from adjacent virgin areas of maple-basswood, white pine, Norway pine and jack pine on well-drained, deep, Cass Lake fine sand. Each of the 3 layers on the hardwood area carried about 5 times as much CaO and 1.5 times as much N as those on the jack and Norway pine areas, whereas those of the white pine had intermediate values. On each type the freshly fallen leaves were similar in composition to the litter. With all 4 types there was a progressive increase in ash, CaO, N, and pH value on passing from litter to duff and from duff to leafmold. Freshly fallen hardwood leaves were about as acid as those of the pines although 3 times as rich in CaO, but the duff and leafmold of the former were much the less acid. The various layers of the maple-basswood type are much richer than those of the pines in P2O5, K2O, and S.																			0038-075X	1538-9243				NOV	1933	36	5					387	398		10.1097/00010694-193311000-00007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00010694-193311000-00007													WOS:000187771800007

Mean (+/- S.D.) concentrations of GEM, GOM, and PBM were 1.54 +/- 0.34 ng m(-3), 14.0 +/- 27.8 pg m(-3), and 2.6 +/- 3.7 pg m(-3), respectively. Concentration-Weighted Trajectory (CWT) analysis indicated that East and coastal China were the main source regions of elevated GEM observed at LABS. Weekly integrated TGM showed significant variations in delta Hg-202(TGM) (-0.42 to 0.41 parts per thousand) and Delta Hg-199(TGM) (-0.31 to -0.13 parts per thousand). Both delta Hg-202(TGM) and Delta Hg-199(TGM) showed clear seasonal variations, but the seasonal pattern of delta Hg-202(TGM) was different from that of Delta Hg-199(TGM). The lowest mean delta Hg-202(TGM) was observed in spring (-0.15 parts per thousand), while the lowest mean Delta Hg-199(TGM) was observed in summer (-0.24 parts per thousand). A significant positive correlation (R-2 = 0.38, p < 0.01) existed between delta Hg-202(TGM) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), suggesting vegetation activity was an important factor controlling the seasonal variation of delta Hg-202(TGM). In contrast, air mass transport path, which influences the source region of TGM to LABS, was likely the driver for the seasonal variations of Delta Hg-199(TGM). Furthermore, results from the air mass classification showed distinguishable Delta Hg-199(TGM) signature for different air mass source regions, with air masses from South China Sea and western Pacific Ocean being characterized by more negative Delta Hg-199(TGM) (-0.25 +/- 0.04 parts per thousand). Results of this research demonstrated a clear difference in isotopic compositions of atmospheric Hg between continental and marine air masses.

J	Gell, PA				Gell, Peter A.			Restoring Murray River floodplain wetlands: Does the sediment record inform on watering regime?	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												The floodplain wetlands of the southern Murray Darling Basin (MDB) have been subject to the impacts of catchment and water resource development for more than a century. Their current degraded state is attributed to the regulation of the rivers and abstraction of water volume for irrigation. The MDB Plan is to return at least 2,750 Gl of mean annual flow to the system to restore the condition of waterways. Considerable recent investment in infrastructure enables water to be released into the basin's floodplain wetlands. The proposed watering regime is underpinned by modelling that suggests that, before regulation, overbank flows would have occurred regularly as discharge peaked in winter and spring. Sediment cores have been extracted from over 50 floodplain wetlands of the southern Murray Basin. Those from several, large meander wavelength billabongs extend for 1,000-5,000 years suggesting that these sites were permanently inundated over that time. Others extend to ~200 years and are presumed not to have accumulated sediment until more recently. The records of most wetlands, however, only extend to the onset of river regulation in the 1920s, suggesting that before then they were not inundated for sufficient duration for net accumulation to occur. Preserved diatoms suggest that the shallow, plant-dominated wetlands of the past have transitioned to deep, turbid water systems today. As rivers are identified as a source of sediment to wetlands, less regular inundation, rather than more, is a viable option in restoring the ecological function of these floodplain wetlands and in slowing sediment infill.

Investigation of Chemical and Radiochemical Fingerprints of Water Resources in Siwa Oasis, Western Desert, Egypt	ARAB JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCES AND APPLICATIONS												Water resources in Siwa oasis, Egypt; included the Nubian sandstone aquifer system (NSSAS), Tertiary carbonate aquifer system (TCAS) as well as springs and lakes. Existing chemical and radiochemical fingerprints of these resources in the central and western parts of the oasis were examined based on the analyses of 30 water samples collected in 2015. In each sample, the analyzed chemical and radioisotopic constituents were Cl-, SO42-, CO32-, HCO3-, Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+, Al, B, Ba, Cd, Co, Fe, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sr, V, Zn, Si and Cr, Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40. Other physical properties included pH and TDS were measured in the field. The chemical analysis was carried out following the ASTM methods, while the radiochemical measurements were done using a hyper pure germanium (HPGe) gamma ray spectrometry. Results of this work may be advantageous to promote the hydrologic database in the oasis, where levels of the natural radioactivity in groundwater resources were established for the first time. Water resources were classified based on their contents of TDS into fresh water for the NSSAS, brackish to salty water for TCAS, brackish water for springs and brine water for lakes. The artesian water of the NSSAS and TCAS and water of the springs were alkaline, while the water of the lakes was acidic. Chemical characters of the groundwater of the NSSAS reflected a little response to the processes of water-rock interactions, and the vice versa was observed for the groundwater of the TCAS. The groundwater of the NSSAS was dominated by HCO3-Na genetic type characterizing the meteoric origin of water. The groundwater of the TCAS was characterized by the presence of three genetic types of water (SO4-Na, Cl-Mg, and Cl-CA water), indicating the modification of the recharged water from the underlain NSSAS due to the effects of water-sediment interactions and mixing with trapped ancient sea water. The chemical properties of spring water were, greatly similar to those of groundwater of the TCAS, which indicated that the springs, under study, discharged their water through faults cutting in the TCAS. Lake water was the more mineralized water in the oasis. It was characterized by the Cl-Ca and SO4-Na genetic types. The abundance of heavy metals in the TCAS, springs and lakes was, generally, higher than it in the NSSAS. Almost, B, Ba, Sr and Si were detected with different concentrations in all water samples from the oasis, while the concentrations of the rest of metals were found to be below or near the detection limits of the applied analytical procedures. The radiochemical constituents increased in the central part of the oasis, like the TDS, major ions and heavy metals ones. The maximum activity values recorded were 5.6 +/- 0.7 Bq/l (NSSAS), 6.7 +/- 1.6 Bq/l (TCAS) and 25.6 +/- 5.9 Bq/l (TCAS) for Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40, respectively.																			1110-0451					JAN	2017	50	1					158	178																WOS:000412240400016

The variation at 14 microsatellites was analyzed for 450 immature sockeye salmon, and a baseline of 387 populations from Japan, Russia, Alaska, Canada, and Washington State was used to determine the stock composition of the fish sampled. Sockeye salmon originating from Alaska were the most abundant in the catch, comprising 86.0% of all sockeye salmon caught, the catch being dominated by sockeye salmon of Bristol Bay origin. Russian-origin sockeye salmon accounted for 10.2% of the catch, while Canadian-origin sockeye salmon accounted for 3.8% of the catch. Salmon from Canada were estimated to originate from the Fraser River, Rivers Inlet (Owikeno Lake), the Skeena River (Babine Lake), the Stikine River, and the Alsek River, British Columbia. These results indicate that the central Bering Sea provides a summer rearing area for some Canadian sockeye salmon.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAR	2011	140	2					296	306		10.1080/00028487.2011.567843	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2011.567843													WOS:000289630100005

Phytoplankton samples and water were collected between March and December 2019 and analyzed using standard methods. Two-way ANOVA revealed significant spatial and seasonal variation in physico-chemical parameters (p < 0.05). Wuyuan had high TP (0.06 & PLUSMN; 0.04 mg L-1), TN (1.14 & PLUSMN; 0.71 mg L-1), NH4+-N (0.07 & PLUSMN; 0.09 mg L-1), Secchi depth (2.28 & PLUSMN; 3.79 m), salinity (3.60 & PLUSMN;5.50 ppt), and EC (332.50 & PLUSMN; 219.10 & mu;S cm(-1)). At the same time, Meishe had high TP (0.07 & PLUSMN; 0.03 mg L-1), TN (1.04 & PLUSMN; 0.74 mg L-1), NH4+-N (0.07 & PLUSMN; 0.10 mg L-1), EC (327.61 & PLUSMN; 63.22 & mu;S cm(-1)), and turbidity (40.25 & PLUSMN; 21.16 NTU). In terms of seasons, spring recorded high average TP, TN, NH4+-N, COD, and DO, while summer had a high temperature, Chl-a, salinity, and EC. Generally, the physico-chemical parameters met the China water quality standard limits (GB 3838-2002). Overall, 197 phytoplankton species belonging to Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta, Cryptophyta, Bacillariophyta, Pyrrophyta, Euglenophyta, Xanthophyta, and Chrysophyta were identified, with Cyanophyta being dominant. Phytoplankton density showed spatial changes varying from 18 x 10(6) cell L-1 to 84 x 10(6) cell L-1. The phytoplankton diversity ranged from 1.86 to 2.41, indicating a mesotrophic state. One-way ANOSIM showed no significant spatial dissimilarity in phytoplankton composition (R = 0.042, p = 0.771) but indicated a significant seasonal difference (R = 0.265, p = 0.001). Therefore, SIMPER analysis revealed that Lyngbya attenuata, Merismopedia tenuissima, Cyclotella sp., Merismopedia glauca, Merismopedia elegans, and Phormidium tenue contributed to the seasonal differences. Furthermore, CCA demonstrated that TP, TN, NH4+-N, COD, Chl-a, and Secchi depth greatly influenced the phytoplankton community. This study shows the spatio-temporal variation in water quality and phytoplankton communities, useful for managing riverine quality.					zhang, pengfei/Q-3884-2017; Mutethya, Eunice/KII-1535-2024														0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2023	195	7							905	10.1007/s10661-023-11483-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-023-11483-4								37382693					WOS:001021116100003

A multi-scale assessment in southeastern Tibetan Plateau	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Region-wide investigation of glacier change in High Mountain Asia marked the strongest recession in southeastern Tibetan Plateau (SETP) in recent decades. However, evident differences of quantitative glacier mass balance (MB) estimations on fine scales exist in the prior reports. The large uncertainties in current geodetic observations over this region highlight the need for more independent validations and investigations on the spatial variability of glacier change. This study enriched glacier MB estimates over the SETP by using the newly released global Digital Elevation Model (DEM) - the TanDEM-X and analyzed the spatial pattern of glacier change on multi-spatial scales by comparing available satellite-based geodetic observations. Results reveal that the TanDEM-X - SRTM elevation differences, which show no obvious horizontal shifts and no significant elevation-dependent bias, provide reliable elevation change information over this challenging area. On the regional scale, the geodetic datasets (the ASTER elevation change rates data, TanDEM-X- SRTM differences, ICESat) achieved a highly consistent estimate of glacier MB at -4.11 +/- 1.52 Gt a(-1) (-0.60 +/- 0.16 m w.e. a(-1)) during 2000 and 2010s. On the subregional scale, the two gridded geodetic datasets revealed a clear contrast between moderate thinning of spring-accumulation type glaciers in the south and significantly more negative glacier MB of summer-accumulation type glaciers in the north. Glacier-wide MB showed high heterogeneity, which was closely related to the combined effect of topographic variation and climate forcings. We observed similar glacier thinning rates between debris-covered land-terminating glaciers and clean-ice glaciers (-0.50 +/- 0.32 m w.e. a(-1)) but remarkable more negative MB (-0.89 +/- 0.36 m w.e. a(-1)) of debris-covered glaciers connected with glacial lakes, which may indicate different evolution process of debris-covered glaciers in the monsoon-influenced region. This study demonstrates that current satellite-based geodetic observations achieve overall consistent patterns of glacier mass changes even over the most challenging mountainous areas (complicated terrain and climate). With the global TanDEM-X DEM and increasing observations from the mission, we expect improved consistency in glacier MB estimation on large spatial scales as well as detailed investigation of glacier mass change variability in the future.					; Ding, Xiaoli/K-4596-2013; Yong, Bin/C-2257-2014; Ke, Linghong/NVM-2414-2025	Ke, Linghong/0000-0001-9374-943X; Song, Chunqiao/0000-0003-1060-4636; 													0034-4257	1879-0704				JUN 1	2020	242								111777	10.1016/j.rse.2020.111777	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.111777													WOS:000523965600029

We examined effects of a changing trophic structure of the planktonic community cascading from the level of zooplankton, through phytoplankton composition and exudation rates to the level of growth responses and losses to grazers of phylogenetically narrow bacterial lineages. Specific probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed important short-lived peaks of genus-like (Fluviiciola sp. and Limnohabitans spp.) or even taxonomically narrower populations of Betaproteobacteria and Flavobacteria (such as FlavB and Flav2 lineages). Protozoan grazing on bacterioplankton was studied by using fluorescently labeled bacteria and by direct analyses of FISH-probe-targeted bacterial phylotypes in flagellate food vacuoles. Evaluations of selective bacterivory, growth responses, and cell biovolumes of various bacterial groups during the spring bloom indicated that certain bacterial groups such as Limnohabitans can contribute to carbon flow to the grazer food chain up to 10-fold more than similarly abundant small cells from the Ac1 lineage of Actinobacteria. During the clear-water phase, filter-feeding cladocera had dominant effects on bacterioplankton abundance and community dynamics, likely through direct grazing on larger bacteria along with altering major substrate pools (via e.g., the herbivores' sloppy feeding on algae). Fine-temporal resolution data revealed several environmental scenarios, in which the interplay of distinct top-down and bottom-up factors resulted in a competitive advantage of particular bacterial lineages.

J	FREVERT, T				FREVERT, T			HEAVY-METALS IN LAKE KINNERET (ISRAEL) .2. HYDROGEN-SULFIDE DEPENDENT PRECIPITATION OF COPPER, CADMIUM, LEAD AND ZINC	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Heavy metal interchange experiments with natural sediment-water systems from the northern and southern part of Lake Kinneret have been carried out under constant temperature, pH2S and pH feedback controlled conditions at the sediment surface and in the overlying water, respectively. For sensoring pH2S (H2S concentrations) a potentiometric glass/Ag2S semi-microelectrode cell without liquid junction was used being placed into the sediment-water interface position. H2S (pH2S) was also measured in the overlying water. Certain proportions of heavy metal solutions (ZnCl2, CdCl2, PbCl2, CuCl2) have been added stepwise into the overlying water and the subsequent uptake or release has been observed by DPASV analyses. When anoxic pH values and H2S concentrations, as were found in situ in the lake, were regulated the added metals were immediately removed from the solution, particulated and probably precipitated as MeSx .cntdot. aq complexes into the sediment. Particularisation was greatest with Zn and least with Cd. After re-aeration Zn was most rapidly, Pb and Cu only slowly (the latter mostly in particulate fraction) released from the sediment. It is concluded that, assuming similar mechanisms in the lake during its annual oxic-anoxic cycling, Cu and Zn should rapidly be fixed into the sediment during summer stagnation; unlike Zn, Cu will only be released after longterm oxic conditions are established at the sediment-water interface. It is consequently evidenced that the sediment may contribute to the pelagial metal concentrations after winter overturn of the lake.																			0003-9136					MAR	1987	109	1					1	24																WOS:A1987G818100001

In this study, using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), we fi rst identify the dominant modes of interannual variability in summer drought condition over NA and then explore the atmospheric patterns responsible for the formation of the modes. The results show that the fi rst empirical orthogonal function (EOF1) mode of summer SPEI over NA exhibits a meridional dipole pattern, which is influenced fl uenced primarily by the polar- Eurasian teleconnection (POL) and circumglobal teleconnection (CGT) patterns. Under the influence fl uence of negative POL and positive CGT patterns, there is an anomalous anticyclone (cyclone) over northwestern Siberia (Lake Baikal to Northeast China). Such atmospheric circulations lead to meridional dipole patterns in air temperature, moisture condition, vertical motion, and cloud cover over NA, favoring decreased (increased) precipitation and increased (decreased) potential evapotranspiration over northern (southern) NA, fi nally contributing to the formation of EOF1. The second EOF (EOF2) shows an approximate zonal dipole pattern, which is influenced fl uenced by the British-Baikal Corridor (BBC) and Scandinavia (SCA) teleconnection patterns. The positive BBC and SCA patterns can lead to an anomalous anticyclone over the Ural Mountains and a cyclone over Lake Baikal. Such atmospheric circulations result in a zonal dipole pattern in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration over NA through changing the local moisture condition, air temperature, and radiation, consequently favoring the formation of EOF2. Fitting analysis indicates that the aforementioned atmospheric factors can explain 76% (55%) of the interannual variability of EOF1 (EOF2).

Lakewide dominance does not predict the potential for spread of dreissenids	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In recent years, quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) have almost completely replaced zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in the Lower Great Lakes. As recreational boats are the main vector of spread for dreissenids in North America, this study examined whether lakes Erie and Ontario could still be sources for the spread of zebra mussels. In the summer-fall of 2010, the abundance of each species of Dreissena on 196 boats from 5 marinas in lakes Erie and Ontario was examined. Additional samples of Dreissena in 2010-2012 were collected in tributaries, bays, and in the upper littoral zones of these lakes. A total of 77 boats were fouled by Dreissena, and of those 61 were fouled by both species, 13 were fouled just by zebra mussels, and only 3 were fouled solely by quagga mussels. Although quagga mussels compose similar to 99% of dreissenids in eastern Lake Erie and in Lake Ontario, on boats at most marinas sampled, zebra mussels were usually more abundant and significantly larger than quagga mussels. Refugia for zebra mussels were found in bays, tributaries, and upper littoral zones with high wave activity. Thus, although quagga mussels are now more abundant than zebra mussels within the Lower Great Lakes, these waterbodies still have the potential to be a source for the spread of zebra mussels, and for some vectors, the propagule pressure from zebra mussels is likely greater than that from quagga mussels.

J	Schettler, G; Schwab, MJ; Stebich, M				Schettler, Georg; Schwab, Markus J.; Stebich, Martina			A 700-year record of climate change based on geochemical and palynological data from varved sediments (Lac Pavin, France)	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												The Fe-flux budget of the meromictic crater Lac Pavin (French Massif Central) is re-evaluated in the light of new results from detailed sediment investigations (geochemistry, sedimentology, pollen, varve counting). Sedimentation of Lac Pavin during the last 700 years is characterised by high net accumulation of biogenic silica (100-500 g m(-2) yr(-1) SiO2) and autochthonous Fe-precipitates (F-Fe-exe=2-200 g m(-2) yr(-1) Fe) at overall high sediment accurnulation (e.g. AD 1530-1890: 3.7 mm yr(-1)). High net accumulation of biogenic silica and Fe-exe is sustained by nutrient and Fe-influx via sub-lacustrine springs. The feeding of the groundwater inflow is closely correlated with the seepage of meteoric waters which declines in winter due to freezing of the ground. In the context of the derived local vegetation dynamics, balanced Fe-exe-flux is interpreted as a proxy for rainfall during the growing season. Meteorological monitoring data document a significant inverse correlation between monthly temperature and rainfall between May and October which reflects enhanced cloudiness for precipitation above average. Beech, growing under suboptimal conditions at the high altitude of the study site, represents a major tree component in the catchment of Lac Pavin. Minor temperature decrease in the growing season can explain reduced flowering of beech in the following year. Distinct short term variability of beech characterised by an inverse Correlation with the balanced F-Fe-exc supports the data interpretation. Two periods with prevailing of overall wetter and cooler conditions in the growing season were derived: ca. AD 1525-1600, and AD 1630-1660. Climate change to drier and warmer conditions is implied around AD 1450 and AD 1620. The Late Maunder Minimum (AD 1675-1715) is characterised by distinct short term variability of the palaeo-hydrological conditions at the study site.

Geochemical record of Late Quaternary paleoclimate from lacustrine sediments of paleo-lake San Felipe, western Sonora Desert, Mexico	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES												Stratigraphy, mineralogy, major and trace elements, organic carbon, carbonate, sulfate and AMS C-14 dates are used to infer Late Quaternary depositional environments and paleo-hydrological conditions in the paleo-lake San Felipe located in the western part of Sonora Desert. Sediment stratigraphy divides the depth profile into aeolian and pluvio-lacustrine regimes. Aeolian regime is constrained to >44.5 C-14 kyr BP. The pluvio-lacustrine regime consists of two stratigraphic units with characteristic geochemical proxies indicating changing chemical weathering, clastic input, salinity and provenance and provides a measure of varying climatic conditions between ca. 37 and 3 C-14 kyr BP. Lower catchment erosion and inflow into the basin, higher lake productivity, precipitation of Na-sulfate mineral and higher clastic input from the proximal aeolian deposits during ca. 37-14 C-14 kyr BP are comparable to the regional registers of dominant winter rainfall related to westerly storm tracks and colder conditions. In the last 12 C-14 kyr BP, higher sedimentation and inflow and lower productivity are comparable to dominant summer rainfall. Higher humidity and lake productivity during ca. 37-29 C-14 kyr BP is possibly due to the position of westerly storm tracks at 31 degrees N and the gradually reducing humidity till ca. 14 C-14 kyr BP is related to northerly migration of westerly storm tracks. Regional arid conditions during ca. 11 C-14 kyr BP and ca. 6 C-14 kyr BP are characterized by influx of coarser quartz and feldspars into the basin. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The formation of Lake Xiarinur commenced during the BOlling-AllerOd warming, as reflected by an abrupt shift in sedimentary facies from eolian sands to lacustrine sediments at a core depth of 3.5m (similar to 14.1 cal. kyr BP). The pollen records demonstrate that desert vegetation with sparse herbs occurred before 14.1 cal. kyr BP, which was succeeded by meadow grassland vegetation from similar to 14.1 -13.3 cal. kyr BP (the BOlling -AllerOd). A dramatic decrease in pollen concentration occurred between similar to 13.3 and 11.7 cal. kyr BP corresponding to the Younger Dryas. The remarkable increases in pollen and Pediastrum concentrations at similar to 11.7 cal. kyr BP suggest that the environment began to ameliorate, and the most humid conditions prevailed until similar to 8.5 cal. kyr BP. The maxima of magnetic concentration-dependent and magnetic-grain-size-dependent parameters, together with high pollen concentrations, between similar to 10 and 9 cal. kyr BP are interpreted as a brief interval of high annual precipitation. Our results indicate a stepwise decrease in effective moisture in the mid-Holocene and an accelerated drying trend in the late Holocene, characteristics typical of an East Asian summer monsoon-influenced region. The broad similarities between our data and other lake records from central-eastern Inner Mongolia, well-dated speleothem O-18 records from southern and central China, and summer insolation at 45 degrees N, support the idea that vegetation and climate changes in the Hunshandake Sandy Land were controlled mainly by fluctuations in the response of the East Asian monsoon to Northern Hemisphere summer insolation.					; Hou, Lifu/LIC-8244-2024; yang, zhenyu/B-9892-2016; Wang, Xisheng/E-4896-2011	Wang, Xisheng/0000-0002-9986-9886; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				MAY	2015	25	5					844	856		10.1177/0959683615571426	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683615571426													WOS:000352719600010

Spatial and temporal variation in nitrogen fixation and its importance to phytoplankton in phosphorus-rich lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Limnological theory posits that phosphorus (P) limits primary production in freshwater lakes, in part because fixation of atmospheric nitrogen (N-2) can compensate for limitations in nitrogen (N) supply to phytoplankton. However, quantitative estimates of the degree to which N-2 fixation satisfies planktonic N demand are rare. Here we used biweekly sampling during summer in seven lakes over 2 decades to estimate both planktonic N-2 fixation and phytoplankton N demand. We further assessed the ability of biologically fixed N to satisfy N needs of primary producers in productive hardwater lakes. Phytoplankton N requirements, derived from estimates of phytoplankton productivity and N content, were moderately synchronous (S = 0.41) among lakes (ca. 0.1-9.2 mg N m(-3) hr(-1)). In contrast, rates of N-2 fixation determined using isotopic natural abundance method (NAM; 0.002-3.2 mg N m(-3) hr(-1)), or heterocyte-based calculations (0.10-1.78 mg N m(-3) hr(-1)), varied asynchronously (S-NAM = -0.03 and S-Heterocyte = -0.11) among basins, accounted for a median of 3.5% (mean 11.3% +/- 21.6) of phytoplankton demand, and were correlated to the abundance of Nostocales cyanobacteria when analysed using generalised additive models. Overall, the total mass of fixed N accounted for a median of only 3.0% of the spring standing stock of total dissolved N in study lakes (mean 7.5 +/- 12.1%), with higher relative importance of fixed N in highly productive downstream lakes. Thus, while fixed N helps sustain primary productivity, particularly in years with high rates of N-2-fixation, it does not appear to eliminate N limitation of phytoplankton growth in these P-rich hardwater lakes.					; Simpson, Gavin/KFQ-1110-2024; Leavitt, Peter/A-1048-2013	Hayes, Nicole/0000-0002-5664-9939; Leavitt, Peter/0000-0001-9805-9307; Simpson, Gavin/0000-0002-9084-8413; Wiik, Emma/0000-0001-5359-6678; Swarbrick, Vanessa/0000-0002-9323-6172													0046-5070	1365-2427				FEB	2019	64	2					269	283		10.1111/fwb.13214	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13214													WOS:000455804900002

Long-term trend during 1901-2005 over Chilka Lake indicates the highest warming in the pre-monsoon season (1.79 degrees C) and lowest warming (1.09 degrees C) was shown in both the winter and post-monsoon seasons while opposite warming trends i.e., the lowest warming was observed in pre-monsoon season and highest warming was shown in the winter season for recent four decades (1969-2009) data. The performance of the CMIP5 GCMs was evaluated over a target point of Chilika Lake. Twelve numbers of models were considered as a group of "better performing GCMs" on the basis of their ability to simulate the long-term trends as well as the mean seasonal correlation with observation. Quantile mapping technique is used for adjusting the bias for the selected GCMs. Improvement in the multi-model ensemble (MME) of bias corrected better performing models compared to MME of 39 GCMs was judged with the help of Taylor plot as well as using four different conventional statistical indices viz. correlation (r), index of agreement (d index), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and root mean square error (RMSE). All the ensemble members commonly available in the four Representative Concentrations Pathways (RCPs) from the better performing selected models show a temperature change of 0.27-3.61 degrees C, 0.38-3.98 degrees C, 0.28-3.72 degrees C, 0.33-3.41 degrees C and 0.22-2.50 degrees C in annual, winter, pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons respectively at the end of 21st century over Chilika Lagoon.

J	Neal, JW; Prchalová, M				Neal, J. Wesley; Prchalova, Marie			Spatiotemporal Distributions of Threadfin Shad in Tropical Reservoirs	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Effective predator management requires accurate knowledge of prey availability and dynamics, yet prey species are rarely studied as intensely as their predatory counterparts. Almost nothing is known about the biology or behavior of threadfin shad Dorosoma petenense in tropical environments, despite that this species is the primary prey in many systems. The goals of this study were to examine spatial and temporal patterns in threadfin shad abundance in tropical reservoirs and to refine protocols for sampling this species. A custom, 3 x 3-m frame trawl was used to sample four reservoirs in Puerto Rico every 3 months for 1 year. Samples were stratified by longitudinal section (upper and lower lake) and by depth strata (0-3, 3-6, 6-9 m). Threadfin shad densities varied markedly among seasons, reservoirs, longitudinal sections, and depth (overall model: F-36,F- 188 = 32.0, P < 0.001, coefficient of variation [CV] = 22.1%, r(2) = 0.86). Density estimates from samples were highest in spring and winter when there was substantially more larval production, and density fluctuated as much as 42-fold among seasons within reservoirs. Differences in mean density were as much as 23 times greater in productive reservoirs than in the least productive reservoir during the same season. Longitudinal variability was substantial between upper and lower reservoir sections (mean percent difference = 70%), but patterns were not consistent among reservoirs or seasons. Threadfin shad showed clear preference for shallow depth strata where 75.4% of fish were collected in the 0-3-m stratum, and only 2.4% collected in the 6-9-m stratum. Oxygen profiles suggested that threadfin shad selected shallow depths even when dissolved oxygen levels were suitable in deeper depth strata. Understanding spatiotemporal patterns in threadfin shad distributions will improve sampling programs in terms of timing and frequency of sampling, longitudinal and vertical sampling design, and sample size requirements.

The nearshore shunt and the decline of the phytoplankton spring bloom in the Laurentian Great Lakes: insights from a three-dimensional lake model	HYDROBIOLOGIA					3rd European Large Lakes Symposium	SEP, 2012	Lake Constance, GERMANY					Dreissenid mussels have been hypothesized to cause selective decreases of phytoplankton in nearshore areas (nearshore shunt hypothesis) as well as the near-complete loss of the offshore phytoplankton spring bloom in some Laurentian Great Lakes. To evaluate whether mussels can reasonably be expected to mediate such changes, we extended the three-dimensional hydrodynamic-ecological model (ELCOM-CAEDYM) to include mussels as a state variable and applied it to Lake Erie (USA-Canada). Mussel-mediated decreases in mean phytoplankton biomass were highly sensitive to the assigned mussel population size in each basin. In the relatively deep east basin, mussels were predicted to decrease phytoplankton in both nearshore and offshore zones, even during periods of thermal stratification but especially during the spring phytoplankton maximum. Spatially, impacts were associated with mussel distributions but could be strong even in areas without high mussel biomass, consistent with advection from areas of higher mussel biomass. The results supported the nearshore shunt hypothesis that mussel impacts on phytoplankton should be greater in nearshore than offshore waters and also supported suggestions about the emerging importance of deep water offshore mussels. The results of this study provide an important insight into ecological role of mussels in lowering plankton productivity in some world's largest lakes.

The Role of Rare Alkalis (Li, Rb, and Cs) as Indicators in Water of the Baikal Geosystem, Russia	DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES												The distribution of rare alkalis (Li, Rb, and Cs) is analyzed in spatially linked water objects of the Baikal geosystem: water of Baikal and its tributaries, underground water from boreholes and thermal springs, and the Angara River (the sole outlet), which are located in the Baikal rift zone. The rare alkali content differs significantly in some water objects, but the average and median contents are similar in the surface and deep water of Lake Baikal and the Angara River. The water of Barguzin thermal springs of the eastern shore of Lake Baikal contains the maximum amount of rare alkalis, but this affects the Baikal water insignificantly due to its natural self-cleaning and deep renewal of water during geodynamic movements. The similar rare alkali contents of Barguzin and some thermal springs of Kamchatka emphasize their indicator role in the genesis of water objects.

Comparison of Arrival Dates of Rail Migration in the Southwest Lake Erie Marshes, Ohio, USA	WATERBIRDS												Several studies have documented the arrival time of spring migration of Virginia Rails (Rallus limicola), King Rails (R. elegans), and Soras (Porzana carolina) on the southwestern shore of Lake Erie, though not in recent decades, and most of this information is based on anecdotal records. These three species were captured in wetlands on Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge in Ottawa and Lucas Counties, Ohio, USA, from 2004 to 2009. Virginia Rails and Soras were documented arriving in northern Ohio earlier than previous research, but not older anecdotal records King Rails were within the bounds of all previous records. Using traps with playback may have allowed us to detect these species at earlier dates than previous research. Documenting current spring migration arrival timing of these three secretive marsh bird species is important for future monitoring, research and wetland management.																			1524-4695	1938-5390				SEP	2015	38	3					312	314																WOS:000361930800012

Effects of climate change on US grain transport	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE												The United States is a global grain supplier. Agriculture uses 22% of all US transported tonnage with grain being the largest component(1). Crop mix shifts are an often cited consequence of climate change(2-4) and such shifts may change the demands grain places on the transport system. Studies also find that climate change could decrease Great Lakes water levels(5-8), shorten the duration of ice cover in the winter(9-11) and alter grain supplies in grain-exporting countries(12). This study investigates the effects of such phenomena on US grain transportation movements both in volumes and modes. Specifically we examine the effects of possible shifts in: crop production patterns; Great Lakes water levels; winter navigation possibilities; and foreign grain production. We find that crop mix shifts reduce the importance of Lower Mississippi River ports, but increase the role of Pacific Northwest ports, Great Lakes ports and Atlantic ports. We also find a shift from barge to rail and truck transport. Conversely, a longer navigation season or a reduction in Great Lake water levels increases grain shipments to the ports in the Lower Mississippi River. Higher use of Great Lakes ports occurs under a reduction of grain production in European exporting countries that compete with Great Lakes ports.					; McCarl, Bruce/E-9445-2011; Attavanich, Witsanu/ABC-5376-2021	Attavanich, Witsanu/0000-0003-1502-5406; 													1758-678X	1758-6798				JUL	2013	3	7					638	643		10.1038/NCLIMATE1892	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NCLIMATE1892													WOS:000324486300018

Diversity of cultured photosynthetic flagellates in the northeast Pacific and Arctic Oceans in summer	BIOGEOSCIENCES												During the MALINA cruise (summer 2009), an extensive effort was undertaken to isolate phytoplankton strains from the northeast (NE) Pacific Ocean, the Bering Strait, the Chukchi Sea, and the Beaufort Sea. In order to characterise the main photosynthetic microorganisms occurring in the Arctic during the summer season, strains were isolated by flow cytometry sorting (FCS) and single cell pipetting before or after phytoplankton enrichment of seawater samples. Strains were isolated both onboard and back in the laboratory and cultured at 4 degrees C under light/dark conditions. Overall, we isolated and characterised by light microscopy and 18 S rRNA gene sequencing 104 strains of photosynthetic flagellates which grouped into 21 genotypes (defined by 99.5% 18 S rRNA gene sequence similarity), mainly affiliated to Chlorophyta and Heterokontophyta. The taxon most frequently isolated was an Arctic ecotype of the green algal genus Micromonas (Arctic Micromonas), which was nearly the only phytoplankter recovered within the picoplankton (< 2 mu m) size range. Strains of Arctic Micromonas as well as other strains from the same class (Mamiellophyceae) were identified in further detail by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the rRNA operon. The MALINA Micromonas strains share identical 18 S rRNA and ITS sequences suggesting high genetic homogeneity within Arctic Micromonas. Three other Mamiellophyceae strains likely belong to a new genus. Other green algae from the genera Nephroselmis, Chlamydomonas, and Pyramimonas were also isolated, whereas Heterokontophyta included some unidentified Pelagophyceae, Dictyochophyceae (Pedinellales), and Chrysophyceae (Dinobryon faculiferum). Moreover, we isolated some Cryptophyceae (Rhodomonas sp.) as well as a few Prymnesiophyceae and dinoflagellates. We identified the dinoflagellate Woloszynskia cincta by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and 28 S rRNA gene sequencing. Our morphological analyses show that this species possess the diagnostic features of the genus Biecheleria, and the 28 S rRNA gene topology corroborates this affiliation. We thus propose the transfer of W. cincta to the genus Biecheleria and its recombination as Biecheleria cincta.

However, quantitative paleoclimate reconstructions based on the biogeochemical composition of biochemical varves are extremely rare, mainly because the climate-proxy relationships are complex and obtaining biogeochemical proxy data at very high (annual) resolution is difficult. Recent developments in high-resolution hyperspectral imaging (HSI) of sedimentary pigment biomarkers combined with micro X-ray fluorescence (mu XRF) elemental mapping make it possible to measure the structure and composition of varves at unprecedented resolution. This provides opportunities to explore seasonal climate signals preserved in biochemical varves and, thus, assess the potential for annual-resolution climate reconstruction from biochemical varves. Here, we present a geochemical dataset including HSI-inferred sedimentary pigments and mu XRF-inferred elements at very high spatial resolution (60 mu m, i.e. >100 data points per varve year) in varved sediments of Lake Zabinskie, Poland, over the period 1966-2019 CE. We compare these data with local meteorological observations to explore and quantify how changing seasonal meteorological conditions influenced sediment composition and varve formation processes. Based on the dissimilarity of within-varve multivariate geochemical time series, we classified varves into four types. Multivariate analysis of variance shows that these four varve types were formed in years with significantly different seasonal meteorological conditions. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to infer seasonal climate conditions based on sedimentary variables. Spring and summer (MAMJJA) temperatures were predicted using Ti and total C (Radj2=0.55; cross-validated root mean square error (CV-RMSE) = 0.7 degrees C, 14.4 %). Windy days from March to December (mean daily wind speed >7 m s-1) were predicted using mass accumulation rate (MAR) and Si (Radj2=0.48; CV-RMSE = 19.0 %). This study demonstrates that high-resolution scanning techniques are promising tools to improve our understanding of varve formation processes and climate-proxy relationships in biochemical varves. This knowledge is the basis for quantitative high-resolution paleoclimate reconstructions, and here we provide examples of calibration and validation of annual-resolution seasonal weather inference from varve biogeochemical data.					; Żarczyński, Maurycy/AAC-4804-2019; Zander, Paul/AAK-3627-2020; Tylmann, Wojciech/AAL-3504-2021	Zarczynski, Maurycy/0000-0003-2989-8152; Zander, Paul/0000-0001-7340-4768; Tylmann, Wojciech/0000-0003-1749-5882; 													1814-9324	1814-9332				OCT 12	2021	17	5					2055	2071		10.5194/cp-17-2055-2021	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-2055-2021													WOS:000706529500001

In this study we analyzed concentrations of CO2, CH4, N2O as well as O-2, N-2 and argon (Ar) from the epilimnion of 75 boreal lakes covering gradients in total organic carbon (TOC), phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) deposition. The Ar-corrected gas saturation deficit was used as a proxy of net metabolic changes from spring overturn to mid-summer sampling (all lakes were dimictic). Emission fluxes were calculated for CO2, CH4 and N2O based on partial pressure, water temperature and wind speed. Gas concentrations, actual and Ar-corrected, were related to lake-specific properties. TOC was the main predictor of CO2 concentrations and fluxes, followed by total P, while total P and chlorophyll a governed CH4 concentrations and fluxes. Nitrogen (NO3 (-) or total N) were key predictors of N2O concentrations and fluxes, followed by total P. Altitude, area and depth were not strong predictors of CO2, CH4 and N2O concentrations and fluxes, likely because only lakes with an area of > 1 km(2) were included. CO2 molar concentrations were negatively correlated with O-2 concentrations, while the slope of CO2 concentration to Ar corrected O-2 deficit was 1.039. Together with the poor correlation between area-specific primary production and CO2 as well as O-2, this suggests that these gases are mostly affected by catabolic processes and probably photo-oxidation in these nutrient-poor, boreal lakes investigated in this study. Increasing inputs of TOC (i.e. lake "browning") is likely to promote the net heterotrophy and hence emissions of all GHGs, while elevated N deposition in particular may cause elevated emissions of N2O.

J	Fan, MJ; Foote, JM; Martin, AJ; Zhu, L				Fan, Majie; Foote, Jordan M.; Martin, Aaron J.; Zhu, Lu			Stable isotope compositions of surface water in Mexico between 22-26 °N	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES												We study the delta O-18, delta D, and d-excess values of 205 surface water samples collected in a wet and a dry season from the west to the east coast of Mexico between 22 and 26 degrees N to understand the controlling factors of isotopic patterns and lapse rates. The samples include lake, pond, river, spring, and tap waters. The delta O-18(6D) values range from -13.parts per thousand (-97.2 parts per thousand) to +20.3 parts per thousand (+74.0 parts per thousand), and decrease from both coasts to higher elevations in the mountains adjacent to the coasts. The lake and pond waters have the largest stable isotopic variations and gentlest surface water slopes (< 5.5) in both seasons, suggesting surface evaporation. Our moisture back trajectory analysis indicates that the strongest evaporation occurs in the Mexican Plateau, where dry season moisture from the east and west mix, and up to 17% of the moisture in the wet season precipitation is recycled. The river waters in the dry season and the spring waters in both seasons also have gentle surface water slopes (similar to 6.6), suggesting some degree of evaporation. On the Sierra Madre Occidental, the delta(18)Oisotopic lapse rate of river and spring water is generally low, -1.3 parts per thousand/km in the wet season and -1.8 parts per thousand/km in the dry season, most likely because of sub-cloud evaporation of rain at high elevation. Our results highlight that isotopic lapse rates vary greatly because of changes in local climate conditions, and these changes are not necessarily contemporaneous at high and low elevations. Therefore, evaporation of ground and river water in the geologic past should be considered in stable isotope-based paleoclimate reconstructions, and a range of isotopic lapse rates should be used in stable isotope paleoaltimetry.

J	Zhang, X; Zheng, Z; Huang, KY; Yang, XQ; Tian, LP				Zhang, Xiao; Zheng, Zhuo; Huang, Kangyou; Yang, Xiaoqiang; Tian, Liping			Sensitivity of altitudinal vegetation in southwest China to changes in the Indian summer monsoon during the past 68000 years	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Reconstructing vegetation changes during a glacial-interglacial cycles in southwest (SW) China is crucial for understanding the amplitude of palaeoclimatic dynamics associated with orbital forcing and evolution of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM). However, few studies on the relationship between paleoclimate and ecosystem changes have covered all of the last glacial-interglacial cycle (or any other), which limits understanding of the ISM's variability and its impact on mountain flora. In particular, knowledge of responses of vertical vegetation belts in margins of the high Tibetan plateau to glacial and subglacial (MIS3) climate changes is poor. To improve understanding, we have studied a continuous core extending back to MIS4 from Tengchong Qinghai volcanic lake in Yunnan Province. Identification of Quercus pollen by scanning electron microscopy showed that most of the abundant oak pollen in the core can be assigned to mountainous taxa of sclerophyllous Quercus living today on the high Tibetan plateau. Their current distribution indicates that the maximum downward shift of vertical vegetation belts during the last glacial period corresponds to a similar to 5.5 degrees C drop in temperature, based on altitudinal lapse rates, in accordance with mean annual temperature (MAT) reconstruction from biomarkers in the same core. Our data clearly suggest that conditions were wet during MIS3, and humidity highest at 38-56 kyr. The wetting appears to have started after the Last Glacial Termination, indicating that the initial deglacial ISM intensification lagged behind rises in temperature and summer insolation. The highest charcoal concentrations and evidence of expansion of open vegetation coincide with the apparent onset of deglaciation (18-16 kyr). These observations indicate that this was the driest period, likely linked with reductions in the polar ice volume and delayed Tibetan glacier melting, which absorbed massive amounts of atmospheric heat and caused regional aridity. Our pollen data clearly correlate with rapid changes such as Younger Dryas and Heinrich Events, and marine records from the Indian Ocean, confirming climate teleconnection through ice volumes and global ocean circulation, and that the ISM is a key factor driving south-north transportation of energy and moisture. The multi-proxy data reveal with high confidence that the Holocene optimum in the region was between 9 and 4 kyr BP, and followed by weakening of the ISM accompanied by increasing anthropogenic disturbance of the vegetation.

The reference strain was provided by the Artemia Reference Center, Ghent, Belgium. The geographical strains evaluated were from Chaplin Lake, Canada; Tientsin, China; Lavalduc, France and San Pablo Bay, USA. There was no significant difference in survival between the fish fed the reference (86%), Canadian (78%), and Chinese (72%) strains, and none between those fed Canadian, Chinese and French (61%) (SNK [student-Newman-Keals] multiple range test). The French strain provided significantly lower survival than the reference strain, and the San Pablo Bay (15%) strain supported significantly lower survival than all the others. Growth in dry weight was highest in fish fed the San Pablo Bay strain (775 .mu.g) though not significantly different from those fed the French (733 .mu.g), reference (673 .mu.g) and Chinese (666 .mu.g) strains. The Canadian strain supported significantly lower growth (423 .mu.g). These results are compared with those of a previous study which evaluated the nutritional quality of 4 additional Artemia strains (Shark Bay, Australia; Margherita di Savoia, Italy; Macau, Brazil and Great Salt Lake, Utah, USA). Of all the strains tested, the reference, Australian and Brazilian strains are considered the most suitable for feeding winter flounder larvae. The reference strain is recommended to be used as a standard diet in future research done with winter flounder larvae.																			0044-8486	1873-5622					1982	29	3-4					279	288		10.1016/0044-8486(82)90141-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0044-8486(82)90141-7													WOS:A1982PG38500006
J	WILLIAMS, JE; BOND, CE				WILLIAMS, JE; BOND, CE			STATUS AND LIFE-HISTORY NOTES ON THE NATIVE FISHES OF THE ALVORD BASIN, OREGON AND NEVADA	GREAT BASIN NATURALIST												Three fishes, 2 spp. of Gila and an undescribed subspecies of cutthroat trout, are endemic to the Alvord Basin. Historically, the Alvord cutthroat trout, Salmo clarki ssp., inhabited the larger creeks of the basin but has been extirpated in pure form because of introgression with introduced rainbow trout, S. gairdneri. Gila boraxobius is restricted to the thermal waters of Borax Lake and its outflows in the northern part of the basin. This species is endangered because of alteration of its fragile habitat. The Alvord chub, G. alvordensis, is recorded from 16 localities throughout the basin, including springs, creeks and reservoirs. Although G. alvordensis as a species is not in jeopardy, many populations are small and could be easily eliminated by habitat destruction or by the introduction of exotic fishes. Competition with exotic guppies, Poecilia reticulata, has extirpated the Thousand Creek Spring population of Alvord chubs. Both species of Gila are opportunistic omnivores, consuming primarily chironomids, microcrustaceans and diatoms. The Borax Lake chub also consumed large numbers of terrestrial insects, but specialized feeding on mollusks was noted in the West Spring population of Alvord chubs. Borax Lake chubs spawn throughout the year, but most spawning occurs in early spring. Borax Lake chubs mature at a small size, occasionally < 30 mm standard length, and seldom live > 1 yr. Alvord chubs are typically much larger than the Borax Lake species and live at least into their 5th yr.																			0017-3614						1983	43	3					409	420																WOS:A1983RG71500005
J	Anderson, MA; Komor, A; Ikehata, K				Anderson, Michael A.; Komor, Andy; Ikehata, Keisuke			Flow routing with bottom withdrawal to improve water quality in Walnut Canyon Reservoir, California	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Walnut Canyon Reservoir is a small source-water reservoir for the City of Anaheim, California. The reservoir receives raw water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and is used for source water storage and emergency storage for the Lenain Filtration Plant. The reservoir naturally stratifies through the summer, with anoxia and elevated concentrations of phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N), manganese (Mn), and sulfide present in the hypolimnion. Water quality modeling using the 1-D DYRESM-CAEDYM model was conducted to evaluate different management strategies for the reservoir. Simulations evaluated the water column conditions in 2010 with (1) existing conditions, with operation of a SolarBee; (2) diffused aeration; (3) hypolimnetic oxygenation; and (4) flow routing with bottom withdrawal. Meteorological data from the nearby California Irrigation Management Information System stations were used to drive the hydrodynamic component of the model; the model was validated using available profile measurements and discrete sampling from April to July 2010. Diffused aeration, hypolimnetic oxygenation, and flow routing with bottom withdrawal were all predicted to improve dissolved oxygen conditions and lower concentrations of P, Mn, and other elements, although flow routing with bottom withdrawal could be implemented without incurring significant capital and operating costs; therefore, the flow routing strategy was implemented in spring 2011. Water column sampling demonstrated improved water quality in line with model predictions and indicated that flow routing with bottom withdrawal can serve as a practical and effective alternative to other engineered solutions under favorable hydraulic and source water quality conditions.					; Ikehata, Keisuke/MBG-7102-2025	Ikehata, Keisuke/0000-0001-9101-9775; 													1040-2381	2151-5530				APR 3	2014	30	2					131	142		10.1080/10402381.2014.898720	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2014.898720													WOS:000335861700004
J	Wang, R; Li, D; Jin, CX; Yang, BW				Wang, Rui; Li, Dong; Jin, Chao Xi; Yang, Bing Wu			Seasonal occurrence and species specificity of fishy and musty odor in Huajiang Reservoir in winter, China	WATER RESOURCES AND INDUSTRY												This paper describes the results of measurements from one year period on the existence of fishy and musty odor in drinking water at low temperatures (1-2 degrees C) in Baotou. China, using an open-loop stripping analysis (OLSA) systems and Gas chromatography spectrometry (GC). The main results show that it is micro-contaminated water body of the raw water in Huajiang Reservoir. The average phytoplankton abundance was 2.06 x 107 L-1, Cyanobacteria counts were at 2.0 x 106 L-1 and the dominate family of the algae are Chlorophyta, Oyptophyta, and Bacillariophyta. Experimental results indicated that under the ice whose thickness was 0.55 m, the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) of the surface varied from 70 to 636 W m(-2) from November to March of next year. The average surface PAR was 114.8 W m(-2), and the lowest value was 70.57 W m(-2) (in December) and the average bottom PAR was 19.04 W m(-2), and the lowest value was 3.84 W m(-2) (in December). The surface PAR, bottom PAR, eutrophic conditions in ice-covered Huajiang reservoir satisfied the growth and MlBfgeosmin production of Cyanobacteria algae in winter. The 2-methyl-isoborneol (MlB) concentration ranged from 29 ng L-1 to 102 ng L-1. The concentration of trans-1,10-cl imethyl-trans-9-clecalol (geosmin) ranges from 20 ng L-1 to 65 ng L-1 and it is 2 to 5 times of the odor threshold concentrations (OTC). The correlations between MIB/geosmin and nitrogen are 0.63-037. Eutrophication is the most important factor influencing synthesis of taste and odors, but not temperature. Using bypassing pipe pumping Yellow River water directly to the Water treatment plant (WTP) is an efficient way about T&O compounds' control in drinking water of Baotou city in winter.

A few examples from the south-eastern Alps (NE Italy)	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Palaeolimnological techniques were applied to spring habitats in the Trentino Region (NE Italy) as a test in order to reconstruct past environmental changes in these crucial and fragile milieus. Three different sites were selected from a database of more than one hundred on the basis of morphological, geological, and biological factors, including human impact evaluation: Nambrone, Paul and Madonnina Val Lomasona. Sampling was performed by adapting standard lake-sediment coring methods, and the retrieved sediment was described and subsampled following standard "lake" procedures. Field work and sedimentological analyses revealed clear influence from nearby fluvial environment for the Nambrone site, whereas Paul and Madonnina Val Lomasona were selected for further analyses (e.g., dating, diatoms, chironomids). Lead-210 and Caesium-137 dating methods were used to obtain a chronological framework, in addition to historical information on land use and other events in the area. The upper part of the Paul sequence presented organic rich sediment compatible with spring environments, but the lower and essentially detrital part appeared to record alluvial deposition, probably linked to extraordinary flood events (1882, 1966). This interpretation is indirectly confirmed by the records of the fallout nuclides Caesium-137 and Lead-210, that were both unfortunately concentrated in the topmost 1 cm, making it impossible to construct a normal age-depth profile. Madonnina Val Lomasona sedimentological and biological indicators point to a marked charge around ca 5 cm, dividing the sequence in two units, corresponding to different environmental conditions. Although the interpretation of the dating results is not completely straightforward, the assembled data suggest that the upper 5 cm of the record represents ca the last 50 years. During this period we found typical limnocrenic, clear-water spring conditions, while before 1960s the coexistence of lotic and lentic chironomid species including several opportunistic ones and the low richness, emphasized the presence of a disturbance (e.g., highly variable flow and/or trophic conditions), as confirmed also by diatom assemblages and,sedimentological features. The recorded disturbance is probably linked to a water-level change due to the local land use, as also testified by historical data. The results of this study support the idea that carefully selected spring sites might be approached with adapted palaeolimnological techniques to extract valuable palaeoenvironmental information. However, it also highlighted the low percentage of "good sites" (1%) and considerable difficulties in coring and sampling without disturbing the sediment.

The late-glacial sediment indicated cool conditions, with an abundance of Microspectra atrofasciata/radialis type fossils at Thunder Lake and Redmountain Lake, and Sergentia at Windy Lake. Sergentia and Tanytarsus lugens/Corynocera oliveri type were dominant in the early Holocene, together with Chironomus at Redmountain Lake. At Thunder and Windy lakes, the early Holocene was dominated by warm-adapted taxa such as Microtendipes. Quantitative midge-temperature inference models reconstruct a 4 to 8 degrees C rise in mean July air temperature for Windy and Thunder lakes at the Pleistocene/Holocene transition. Early-Holocene temperatures averaged 3 to 4 degrees C warmer than those extant today. In contrast, no long-term temperature trend was evident at Redmountain Lake. This site may not reflect actual trends in air temperature due to runoff from a persistent snow pack in the watershed. Comparison of midge and pollen data suggests an inverse relationship between summer temperature and precipitation through the middle to late Holocene. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Changes in diet differ between species and habitats and may also be affected by turbidity (eutrophication). We investigated the diet (stomach content) and the food selection (ratio of ingested prey and prey availability) of roach and perch larvae in a clear lake and of roach, perch and pikeperch larvae in a turbid lake multiple times during spring to autumn. The diet of the fish larvae changed with size, and for roach and perch larvae between the lakes. Coexisting species of fish larvae had different diets in the two lakes, pointing to resource partitioning; yet, in the clear lake, medium-sized larvae had a high diet overlap, suggesting a competitive relationship at this developmental stage. In the clear lake, roach larvae showed diel differentiation in diet, while perch demonstrated diet shifts between habitats, which probably aided in reducing competition and also evidenced an effect of light on the larval prey capture and/or predator-fish larvae interactions. In the turbid lake, roach and perch larvae did not reveal differences in diet between habitats or time of the day, owing to homogeneity of food items and poor light conditions. However, the diet of pikeperch larvae differed between day and night following daily variations in the abundance of its preferred prey. The roach larvae were highly selective for Bosmina, Daphnia and benthic cladocerans, perch larvae generally consumed what was available, while pikeperch primarily preyed on cyclopoid copepodites. We conclude that turbidity acted as a cover for fish larvae in the turbid lake. Under eutrophication-induced turbidity scenarios the effects of fish larvae on their prey are stronger (i.e., high selectivity for several resources) than that of larvae in clear waters, creating a negative feedback on the path to restore water clarity.

Summer Resource Selection and Identification of Important Habitat Prior to Industrial Development for the Teshekpuk Caribou Herd in Northern Alaska	PLOS ONE												Many caribou (Rangifer tarandus) populations are declining worldwide in part due to disturbance from human development. Prior to human development, important areas of habitat should be identified to help managers minimize adverse effects. Resource selection functions can help identify these areas by providing a link between space use and landscape attributes. We estimated resource selection during five summer periods at two spatial scales for the Teshekpuk Caribou Herd in northern Alaska prior to industrial development to identify areas of high predicted use for the herd. Additionally, given the strong influence parturition and insect harassment have on space use, we determined how selection differed between parturient and non-parturient females, and between periods with and without insect harassment. We used location data acquired between 2004-2010 for 41 female caribou to estimate resource selection functions. Patterns of selection varied through summer but caribou consistently avoided patches of flooded vegetation and selected areas with a high density of sedge-grass meadow. Predicted use by parturient females during calving was almost entirely restricted to the area surrounding Teshekpuk Lake presumably due to high concentration of sedge-grass meadows, whereas selection for this area by non-parturient females was less strong. When insect harassment was low, caribou primarily selected the areas around Teshekpuk Lake but when it was high, caribou used areas having climates where insect abundance would be lower (i.e., coastal margins, gravel bars). Areas with a high probability of use were predominately restricted to the area surrounding Teshekpuk Lake except during late summer when high use areas were less aggregated because of more general patterns of resource selection. Planning is currently underway for establishing where oil and gas development can occur in the herd's range, so our results provide land managers with information that can help predict and minimize impacts of development on the herd.

We investigate the predisposing, triggering and propagation processes of a rock avalanche (c. 225,000 m3) that occurred in Vallon d'& Eacute;tache (France) on 18 June 2020, whose scar was coated by ice and water. Weather records and energy balance models show that the rock avalanche occurred right after the warmest spring and winter since at least 1985, but also right after the spring with the highest water supply anomaly (snowmelt and rainfall). Measured ground surface temperature and geoelectrical surveys reveal that relatively ice-rich permafrost could exist in the NW face (release area) while it is inexistent below the SE face, contradicting certain permafrost maps. Heat transfer simulations suggest that the rock avalanche occurred during a transition from cold to warm permafrost conditions at failure depth (30 m), with a temperature increase of up to 0.6 degrees C per decade since 2012 (when considering potential snow cover effect), and current temperature ranging between -3 and -1 degrees C, depending on the applied model forcing. This warming certainly contributed to predispose slope to failure. In addition, the shift towards warm permafrost and water infiltration potentially enhancing permafrost degradation along fractures through heat advection or favouring the development of high hydrostatic pressures may have played as triggering factors. Finally, propagation simulations show that the rock avalanche involved several phases with different rheological properties due to the incorporation of snow and material segregation within the deposit. These new insights at various scales highlight the complexity of the triggering and propagation processes of rock slope failure occurring in high mountains, a significant part of which can be linked to snow effects on ground temperature, water supply and rheological properties. This paper investigates the triggering and propagation conditions of a recent rock avalanche (c. 225,000 m3, French Alps, 2020) at a permafrost site. Several methods including temperature monitoring, geophysical survey, energy balance and heat transfer modelling show a permafrost warming with a transition from cold to warm permafrost in the release area and significant water infiltration weeks and days prior to the event. Runout simulations point out the complexity of the propagation mechanism, involving several phases and different rheological properties. image					Chambon, Guillaume/F-9975-2011; Deline, Philip/AFR-6521-2022; FAUG, Thierry/M-5877-2013; Bodin, Xavier/H-2677-2018; Revil, Andre/L-1132-2015	Cathala, Maeva/0000-0001-7212-3104; Ben-Asher, Matan/0000-0003-3393-7978; Bodin, Xavier/0000-0001-6245-4030; Revil, Andre/0000-0001-7979-7005														1096-9837				AUG	2024	49	10					3221	3247		10.1002/esp.5881	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/esp.5881		MAY 2024											WOS:001224025800001

Decadal differences of the diurnal temperature range in the Aral Sea region at the turn of the century	TELLUS SERIES A-DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Changes in the surface air diurnal temperature range (DTR) have been highlighted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as critical uncertainties in climate change studies. Due to global and local factors, the regional climate in the Aral Sea region is changing intensively, providing a good case study to give a detailed description of the DTR trend and its spatial variability. Results are based on data from 33 stations at the RIHMI-WDC from 1991 to 2010. The values of DTR in the region range between about 3 degrees C and 18 degrees C, with the maxima values being observed in spring and summer. The largest differences between the two decades of the annual mean DTR are observed at the stations closest to the pre-desiccation state of the lake shoreline, especially in the south (0.6 degrees C dec(-1)). To the west of the Aral Sea, where the lakeshore has receded less, these differences are also expectedly high considering the decrease in the thermal inertia of the remaining lake (0.4 degrees C dec(-1)). To the north-east of the lake, the decadal differences of the annual mean DTR were not significant, but decadal differences of the seasonal DTR were large from February to April (-0.4 degrees C dec(-1)) coinciding with the season when the decadal differences of the mean local temperature is of 2 degrees C dec(-1). In the south, where the artificial Sarygamysh Lake expanded during the studied period, the decadal difference of the annual mean DTR is negative. The increase in the mean temperature of all the stations between the two decades is of 0.5 degrees C dec(-1). From August to October, in the southern and the south-eastern parts of the Aral Sea, the increase of the maximum daily temperatures was about 0.1 degrees C dec(-1) larger than the increase of the mean temperatures.

The Akademichesky Ridge is an uplift in the center of Lake Baikal, separated from the shoreline by deep basins. Therefore, the possible mechanisms of transportation of elastic pebbles are summer (by air) and winter (by ice) eolic transportation, glacial transportation, and disintegration of the ridge rocks. The character of the surfaces of garnet grains along with experimental data support the important role of eolic transportation in sedimentation. Five groups of garnets, corresponding to various types of metamorphic and metasomatic rocks, are distinguished according to their composition: 1) almandine-pyrope-grossular, typical of metamorphic rocks of mafic and intermediate compositions; 2) andradite-grossular, usual for scarns and high-temperature synmetamorphic metasomatites; 3) almandine-pyrope, occurring in metapelites of greenschist-amphibolite and granulite facies of metamorphism; 4) spessartite-almandine, typical of gondites and pegmatite veins; and 5) almandine-grossular, occurring in high-pressure metamorphic rocks. According to the distribution of specific garnet-bearing rocks in the crystalline basement of Baikal, two regions are distinguished as sourcelands of terrigenous material: Ol'khon region and Svyatoi Nos Peninsula. Taking into account the principal role of eolic processes in transportation of elastic pebbles, it is established that the predominant winds over the last 200 ka were of southwestern and eastern directions.

Increasingly severe cyanobacterial blooms and deep water hypoxia coincide with warming water temperatures in reservoirs	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Cyanobacterial blooms are expected to intensify and become more widespread with climate change and sustained nutrient pollution, subsequently increasing threats to lentic ecosystems, water quality, and human health. However, little is known about their rates of change because long-term monitoring data are rare, except for some well-studied individual lakes, which typically are large and broadly dispersed geographically. Using monitoring data spanning 1987-2018 for 20 temperate reservoirs located in the USA, we found that cyanobacteria cell densities mostly posed low-to-moderate human health risks until 2003-2005, after which cell densities rapidly increased. Increases were greatest in reservoirs with extensive agriculture in their watersheds, but even those with mostly forested watersheds experienced increases. Since 2009, cell densities posing high human health risks have become frequent with 75% of yearly observations exceeding 100,000 cells ml(-1), including 53% of observations from reservoirs with mostly forested watersheds. These increases coincided with progressively earlier and longer summer warming of surface waters, evidence of earlier onset of stratification, lengthening durations of deep-water hypoxia, and warming deep waters in non-stratifying reservoirs. Among years, higher cell densities in stratifying reservoirs were associated with greater summer precipitation, warmer June surface water temperatures, and higher total Kjeldahl nitrogen concentrations. These trends are evidence that expected increases in cyanobacterial blooms already are occurring as changing climate conditions in some regions increasingly favor their proliferation. Consequently, their negative effects on ecosystems, human health, and socioeconomic wellbeing could increase and expand if warming trends and nutrient pollution continue.

Use of remote sensing-derived variables in developing a forest fire danger forecasting system	NATURAL HAZARDS												Our aim was to develop a remote sensing-based forest fire danger forecasting system (FFDFS) and its implementation in forecasting 2011 fire season in the Canadian province of Alberta. The FFDFS used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived 8-day composites of surface temperature, normalized multiband drought index, and normalized difference vegetation index as input variables. In order to eliminate the data gaps in the input variables, we propose a gap-filling technique by considering both of the spatial and temporal dimensions. These input variables were calculated during the i period and then integrated to forecast the fire danger conditions into four categories (i.e., very high, high, moderate, and low) during the i + 1 period. It was observed that 98.19 % of the fire fell under "very high" to "moderate" danger classes. The performance of this system was also demonstrated its ability to forecast the worst fires occurred in Slave Lake and Fort McMurray region during mid-May 2011. For example, 100 and 94.0 % of the fire spots fell under "very high" to "high" danger categories for Slave Lake and Fort McMurray regions, respectively.

Sedimentation and seasonal variation of hexachlorocyclohexanes in sediments in a eutrophic lake, China	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART B-PESTICIDES FOOD CONTAMINANTS AND AGRICULTURAL WASTES												Hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) concentrations in sediments and sediment trap fluxes of particulate organic carbon and HCHs were measured bi-weekly from March 31 to October 18, 2006 in an urban eutrophic lake in Tianjin, China, in order to investigate sedimentation and seasonal variation of HCHs in sediments. HCH concentrations (dry weight basis) ranged from 2.2 to 20.2 ng/g (mean 7.7 ng/g) in surface sediments and from 26.6 to 972.7 ng/g (mean 187.0 ng/g) in settling particles, respectively. A clear seasonal variation in HCH sedimentation and HCH concentrations in sediments was observed. The maximal HCH deposition occurred following a spring phytoplankton bloom. The average flux of HCHs to sediment was approximately 21-fold higher in April to mid-June as compared to late June to October. This was attributed to the high vertical fluxes at the end of the spring phytoplankton bloom. The maximum values of HCH concentrations in sediments were observed in mid-June to late July. Concentrations of HCHs in sediments from the eutrophic lake were well-correlated with organic carbon contents in sediments. The annual sediment trap flux of HCHs in the eutrophic lake, which was estimated using data obtained in the eutrophic lake, was 117 mu g/m(2) yr, about 72% of which was attributed to the sedimentation corresponding to spring bloom phytoplankton deposition in late May to mid-June. The high sediment trap flux of HCHs in the eutrophic lake was related to serious local contamination.

J	Drake, KL; Frey, M; Hogan, D; Hedley, R				Drake, Kiel L.; Frey, Matthew; Hogan, Danica; Hedley, Richard			Using Digital Recordings and Sonogram Analysis to Obtain Counts of Yellow Rails	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												Autonomous recording units (ARUs) are emerging as a useful technology for the study and monitoring of animals that produce vocalizations. During summer and fall of 2013, we performed a series of experiments aimed at developing sampling protocols to count nocturnally active yellow rails (Coturnicops noveboracensis) from sound recordings. Field-based portions of the work took place in the rural municipality of Foam Lake, Saskatchewan, Canada, in an open landscape where yellow rails can be found during the breeding season; lab-based portions of the work occurred in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. Our objectives were to 1) determine the frequency of yellow rail vocalizations to derive an empirically based sampling interval for counting individual birds; 2) assess the accuracy of yellow rail counts made from recordings; 3) determine the approximate sampling radius of the ARU for detecting yellow rails; and 4) determine the approximate audio volume ("loudness") of yellow rail calls. We developed a sonogram-based method for counting individual birds on recordings. Using field recordings of individual yellow rails, we generated recordings with known numbers of calling individuals (i.e., 1-12) and tested the accuracy of the sonogram-based counts. Regardless of experience, observers were able to determine the number of rails calling with a high level of accuracy, especially when the chorus was composed of <= 6 individuals. From broadcast trials employing multiple ARUs, we found the effective detection radius of calling yellow rails to be between 150 m and 175 m. Although detection radius was influenced by broadcast intensity and ambient conditions, we view this range of distance as a reasonable estimate of the effective sampling radius for the ARUs that we used, which is useful for deriving values of density estimates. Finally, we measured loudness of yellow rail calling at approximately 95 dB; this value is useful to research efforts attempting to mimic actual yellow rails (e.g., call-broadcast surveys, additional ARU experiments). A combination of the sonogram-counting method and baseline information on detection radius of the ARU provides a tool that will generate high-quality data on yellow rail occurrence, abundance, and density. Digital recorders represent a means to rapidly improve survey coverage of yellow rails throughout the species' range.

Sustaining the productivity of these ecosystems requires maintaining soil productivity. Management activities that decrease soil porosity or remove organic matter can reduce productivity. We determined effects of three levels of soil compaction and organic matter removal (OMR) on aspen regeneration and growth following winter harvest of aspen-dominated stands in northern Minnesota, western Upper Michigan, and northern lower Michigan. Compaction treatments were applied to increase surface soil bulk density by either zero, 15, or 30 percent. The OMR treatments were merchantable bole harvest (MBH); total tree harvest (TTH); and total woody vegetation, plus forest floor removal (FFR). Soil compaction tended to increase mean sucker diameter and height on the sand and decrease them on the fine textured soils. Compaction greatly reduced sucker density and growth on the most productive silt-loam soil, primarily due to late spring treatment. These results apply to planning of operational harvest of aspen-dominated stands throughout the northern Great Lakes region. Sucker density increased with level of OMR on all three sites. On the sand site, mean diameter, height, and biomass were greatest with MBH and decreased significantly with increasing OMR, indicating a potential decline in productivity with repeated total tree harvesting on sand soils.																			0363-6224						2002	546						59	67																WOS:000179730900008

Three radio-linked data acquisition Pioneer buoys were deployed at 20 in, 40 m and 60 m depths approximately 2.1 km, 6.1 km and 9.2 km from shore respectively. Each buoy was equipped with a temperature sensor string to measure the thermal profile and multiparameter sondes to measure temperature, specific conductivity, turbidity, % saturation DO2, pH and chlorophyll fluoresence. The thermal front, identified by a 4 degrees C vertical isotherm known as the thermal bar, was clearly observed passing each buoy as it moved from shallow to deeper water as the spring wore on. Sonde measurements showed some correlations with the onset of thermal stratification. This paper presents the design of the thermal bar buoy array, the temperature profiles and sonde data and discusses future directions.																			0197-7385		978-1-4244-4960-6				2009							1274	1278																WOS:000280322600188

Fault Zone Control on Rapid Groundwater Flow in Cretaceous Carbonates of the Hidden Valley Fault Zone, Texas	LITHOSPHERE												Understanding geological controls on subsurface fluid flow is critical for groundwater resource management and aquifer protection and is particularly challenging in faulted carbonate aquifers due to dissolution and conduit development. We conducted an integrated hydrologic study of the Hidden Valley fault zone in mechanically layered Glen Rose Formation (Trinity Aquifer) exposed in the Canyon Lake gorge in central Texas. Initial hydrologic assessment included geochemistry of water from springs, water wells, and adjacent Canyon Lake, and water temperature, conductivity, and flow monitoring. Geochemistry results indicate spring sourcing from Canyon Lake rather than the Trinity Aquifer. Water temperature and conductivity monitoring indicated complex water movement in the fault zone including spring discharge, surface flow, water infiltration (recharge) along the fault zone, and subsurface flow via secondary porosity (e.g. faults, fractures, vugs). We conducted tracer tests with three distinct dyes (Uranine, Eosin, Phloxine B) at three locations in the fault zone and monitored water at (i) down-gradient springs within the fault zone, (ii) wells in the hanging wall and footwall of the Hidden Valley fault zone, and (iii) the Guadalupe River upstream and downstream of confluence with the gorge outflow. One or more dyes were detected at all down-gradient spring, seep, and stream monitoring sites, but none were detected at monitored water wells or upstream river sites. Uranine injected into a recharge feature (sink) along the fault core travelled laterally underground along the fault zone up to 1993 m/d. Eosin injected in the footwall travelled across the footwall fault damage zone (approximately perpendicular to the fault) at 987 m/d and parallel to the fault at up to 2596 m/d. Fault zone deformation features, including normal faults, extension fractures, and associated dissolution, produced strongly anisotropic hydraulic conductivity that is >7 times larger parallel to the fault compared with perpendicular to the fault.																			1941-8264	1947-4253				AUG 22	2025	2024				SI				178	10.2113/2024/lithosphere_2024_178	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/2024/lithosphere_2024_178													WOS:001555886100001
J	Meding, ME; Jackson, LJ				Meding, ME; Jackson, LJ			Biological implications of empirical models of winter oxygen depletion	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We compiled data for 23 North American temperate zone lakes to assess three alternative winter O-2 depletion models for estimating O-2 dynamics from freezing to thawing. Dissolved O-2 concentrations were constant or declined slightly for an average of 40 days after freezing and then declined rapidly. Once O-2 concentrations reached 1-3 mg .L-1, consumption slowed. No model that we fit captured O-2 dynamics shortly after freezing. The best fit was a one-pool exponential decay model after one to four initial data were removed. Photosynthesis and freeze-out estimates suggest that O-2 inputs are more important in shallow than in deep lakes. Oxygen decay rates (k) correlated with morphometry in shallow lakes and chlorophyll a, Secchi depth, and the sediment surface area to volume ratio in deep lakes. We hypothesize that the failure of chlorophyll a to correlate with k in shallow lakes is because macrophytes are the primary source of decaying organic matter but have not been included in assessments of winter O-2 depletion. Thus, some processes in deep lakes cannot simply be scaled to smaller scales in shallow lakes.																			0706-652X					SEP	2001	58	9					1727	1736		10.1139/f01-109	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f01-109													WOS:000170811300004

An analysis of habitat use by juveniles revealed separation among the species: roach occurred in the upper, perch and smelt in the deeper water layers. Food and habitat were alternatively partitioned among the juveniles. In early summer the lowest food overlap between perch and smelt coincided with high habitat overlap. In October high food overlap between perch and smelt corresponded with low habitat overlap. Smelt and roach fry used common food resources throughout the season, but they were segregated in habitat.																			0018-8158					NOV 15	1991	226	2					81	89		10.1007/BF00006809	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006809													WOS:A1991GX12800003

Age, Growth, Maturity, and Fecundity of Yellowstone Lake Cutthroat Trout	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												Demographic data are sparse for Yellowstone cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri; YCT). Data for YCT in the spawning run (spring; 29 years) of a Yellowstone Lake tributary or caught in gill nets set (fall; 30 years) at established lake locations between 1977 and 2007 were examined. Female proportion in runs averaged 0.61 but was 0.48 among gillnetted "prespawner" YCT (i.e., mature fish whose excised gonads indicated the fish would have spawned the next year). Maturity proportion-total length (TL) relationships for gillnetted female and male YCT were logistic-shaped and similar in their inflection points; maturity onset occurred at 200-250 mm TL; similar to 95% of YCT >= 400 mm TL were mature and similar to 70% were prespawners. Fecundity was positively associated with YCT TL. Accuracy of scale-based YCT ages was affected by a frequently overlooked scale annulus and an inability to unequivocally identify fish of a single cohort on the basis of scale characteristics using associated, recognized ageing criteria for this population. Temporal differences in fits of a modified von Bertalanffy growth model to YCT TL at capture and scale-based age probably resulted from ageing errors evident among successive, annual scale analysts rather than differences in YCT growth. Nevertheless, when the age estimates of one, long-term analyst were used in analyses, the estimated growth parameters L-infinity and omega were concordant with empirical observations of the maximum TL of YCT and TL of age-1 YCT in Yellowstone Lake, respectively. The demographic relationships and linking, parameterized growth model provide a useful foundation for age-structured population modeling.

However, acidified streams remain common in the region, which limits recovery of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) populations. To investigate liming as a method to accelerate recovery of brook trout, the channels of two acidified streams were limed annually from 2012 to 2015, and an entire watershed of a third acidified tributary was limed by helicopter in 2013. Stream flow, water chemistry, and density of young-of-year (YOY) brook trout were measured in limed streams, an untreated acidified stream, and a buffered reference stream. Lime additions increased pH and acid-neutralizing capacity and decreased inorganic monomeric aluminum concentrations to less than 2.0mol/L, the minimum concentration at which in situ brook trout mortality has been documented. However, of the two channel-limed streams, only stream T8 showed a significant response (P<0.01) in YOY density, increasing from a mean of 0.4fish/m(2) before liming to 2.7fish/m(2) after liming. No YOY brook trout response was observed in the stream within the limed watershed. Groundwater inputs to streams were identified by relative differences in temperature and concentrations of silica and sodium. YOY brook trout densities increased only in the channel-limed stream (T8) with suitable groundwater inputs for fall spawning and a summer nursery. Results suggest that targeted liming of acidified streams with the necessary groundwater habitat could be beneficial in accelerating recovery of brook trout populations.

Currently, there are few quantitative studies on the relative contributions of different processes to salinity enrichment of water bodies. In this study, sixty-seven water samples were collected for chemical, and isotopic analysis, along with simulation calculations. The results reveal distinct hydrochemical types of river water, phreatic water, lake water and hot spring water in the investigated area are Ca-Mg-HCO3, Na-Ca-HCO3, Na-SO4-HCO3 and Na-HCO3, respectively. Average temperature and depth of geothermal water storage are 196 degrees C and 1338 m, respectively. Average arsenic (As) content in hot spring water (298 mu g/L) higher than that in lake water (39.2 mu g/L), river water (9.59 mu g/L) and phreatic water (4.02 mu g/L). The & sum;REEs content of river water in the study area is much higher than that of phreatic water and lake water. Result of delta D and delta 18O indicate that atmospheric precipitation is the source of recharge for all water bodies in the study area. Quantitative calculations indicate that evapo-concentration significantly enriches lake water salinity, contributing on average 90% of its salt content. In contrast, mineral dissolution contributes predominantly to the salinity of hot spring water (90.7%), phreatic water (65.8%), and river water (45.2%). Evapo-concentration emerges as the dominant mechanism for lake water salinity, while carbonate mineral dissolution primarily affects river water. Phreatic water and hot spring water are mainly controlled by the weathering and dissolution of silicate. The results can provide a theoretical basis for the study of the formation mechanism of water salinity in other regions with similar geological environment in the world.

Geochemical and microbiological variability of aerobic and anaerobic sediments along a bifurcated sulphate-saturated brine spring in western Canada	DEPOSITIONAL RECORD												A tufa mound developed at La Saline Lake, an oxbow of the Athabasca River in the Athabasca Oil Sands deposit of north-east Alberta, is characterised by an unusual emplacement of a gypsum caprock. This two-tiered architecture resulted from the bicarbonate-saturated groundwater flow along Upper Devonian limestone being redirected deeper and encountering the halite-anhydrite dissolution trend within the underlying Middle Devonian Prairie Evaporite Formation, 175 to 200 m below. Migrations up-section of sulphate-saturated brine resulted in the gypsum caprock on the tufa mound and discharge of a sulphate-saturated brine spring with total dissolved solids of ca 80,000 mg/L. The brine spring is bifurcated with flows to the south-west and north-west. Calcite-gypsum thrombolytic bottom sediments along the south-western branch were covered by a halite deposit and subsequently a gypsum crust with a microbial community dominated by the cyanobacteria Coleofasciculus chthonoplastes. The thrombolite contact zone with the halite-gypsum encrustation has a more diversified community with the cyanobacteria Dactylococcopsis. Cyanobacterial mats that wrap around the bulbous gypsum crust protuberances distributed along the brine pool bottom surfaces have significant eukaryotic diversity, represented by the heterotrophic Ochrophyte Paraphysomonas. In contrast, sediments accumulated along the adjacent spring branch flow to the north-west were thicker and clogged by abundant decomposed and fermented floral debris, unlike the deposit accumulated along the south-western branch. This resulted in an oxygen-depleted anaerobic environment dominated by sulphate-reducing bacteria resulting in a calcite-rich and sulphate-starved anaerobic sediment with ca 20% elemental sulphur and emanation of H2S gas.

Long-term habitat degradation affects nest site selection behaviour by a freshwater turtle (Chelodina oblonga) in Western Australia	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												Freshwater turtles are one of the most endangered vertebrate groups with >60% of species threatened globally. Terrestrial nesting habitat degradation is a major threat to freshwater turtles, but the characteristics of nesting habitat remain poorly understood. This study investigated the nest site selection of the southwestern snake-necked turtle (Chelodina oblonga) to improve the conservation prospects for this species in an urbanized wetland area. In total, 235 depredated and 86 non-depredated nest sites and 320 non-nest locations were surveyed at Bibra Lake, Western Australia, during the Austral spring-summer, 2018-2023. A suite of environmental variables was measured at nest sites and non-nest locations. Analysis of similarities was used to determine whether nest sites and non-nest locations differed in their environmental characteristics. Generalized linear mixed models were used to identify environmental variables that best explained the nesting preferences. The environmental characteristics of nest sites differed from those of non-nest locations, with turtles nesting mainly in remnant natural habitat with greater canopy cover. Turtles generally avoided nesting in modified environments such as lawns and impervious surfaces. Factors influencing nest site selection are probably associated with the conditions necessary for regulating incubation temperatures and ease of nest excavation. This study suggests that modification of terrestrial vegetation around wetlands is adversely affecting freshwater turtle recruitment by removing or altering preferred nesting habitat. Protection and restoration of natural habitats fringing urban wetlands is important for the conservation of remnant freshwater turtle populations, and local partnership projects can help to achieve this.					; Ebner, Brendan/J-3759-2014; Beatty, Stephen/H-8702-2019	Beatty, Stephen/0000-0003-2620-2826; Santoro, Anthony/0000-0003-4606-6294; Ebner, Brendan/0000-0001-8808-4998; 													1052-7613	1099-0755				FEB	2024	34	2							e4085	10.1002/aqc.4085	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.4085													WOS:001158606400001

Picentini (Campania, province of Salerno). In the past, the graben hosted a lake basin, filled lat a later stage by fluvial-lacustrine deposits, cut in turn by the Tusciano River and by the Isca della Serra Creek. The town of Acerno lies on one of the terraced surfaces. Along the banks of the Tusciano River and the Isca della Serra Creek, on the outskirts of the town of Acerno, two important groups of springs (with a total discharge of about 1000 L/s) are located and tapped by the Ausino Consortium public water supply. All previous data concerning the various groundwater catchment plants, implemented by new measurements (piezometric, hydrochemical and isotopic - O-18 and H-2), have led to improve the knowledge on the various hydrogeological aspects related to the origin of the springs and their recharge areas. In detail, the main achieved results are the following: all the springs are, in different ways, exits of the same groundwater body hosted within the dolomitic bedrock, buried by the detritic-alluvial deposits of the graben; a significant groundwater flow to the Tusciano River comes from the right bank of the river, in contrast to the present hydrogeological interpretation; the limits of the groundwater basin feeding the Acerno spring groups have been established more accurately, especially on the basis of the groundwater balance.					; Ducci, Daniela/B-9457-2012	Monti, Gennaro Maria/0000-0003-0136-6904; Ducci, Daniela/0000-0001-8245-2403; Forestieri, Giulia/0000-0003-2557-8637; 													1825-6635	2035-5688					2017					1		17	28		10.4408/IJEGE.2017-01.S-02	http://dx.doi.org/10.4408/IJEGE.2017-01.S-02													WOS:000426059200003

The results showed that the lake belongs to the eutrophic-supertrophic type in terms of key habitat factors measurement. The seasonal succession of phytoplankton community was determined. The dominant cyanobacterial species Oscillatoria tenuis Ag. bloomed in autumn, although the other species with higher degrees of dominance never bloomed in the year investigated.

However, the underlying mechanism is not yet fully illustrated. We provide a novel insight to address this from interactions between sediment P and nitrification through monthly field investigations including 204 samples and microcosm experiments in Lake Chaohu. Total N to P mass ratios (TN/TP) varied significantly across seasons especially during algal bloom in summer, with the average value being 26.1 in June and descending to 7.8 in September gradually, triggering dominant cyanobacterial succession from Microcystis to Dolicho-spermum. The regulation effect of sediment N/P on water column TN/TP was stronger in summer than in other seasons. Iron-bound P and alkaline phosphatase activity in sediment, rather than ammonium, contributed to the higher part of nitrification. Furthermore, our microcosm experiments confirmed that soluble active P and enzymatic hydrolysis of organic P, accumulating during algal bloom, fueled nitrifiers and nitrification in sediments. These processes promoted lake N removal and led to relative N deficiency in turn. Our results highlight that N and P cycles do not exist independently but rather interact with each other during lake eutrophication, supporting the dual N and P reduction program to mitigate eutrophication in shallow eutrophic lakes.					jian, Xiao/HNI-0453-2023; liu, yuqian/ITV-9412-2023; Zhou, Zijun/JBS-6942-2023	zhou, zijun/0000-0001-6984-1340													0013-936X	1520-5851				2023 FEB 8	2023										10.1021/acs.est.2c07599	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.2c07599		FEB 2023						36753734					WOS:000932253200001
J	Mi, CR; Falk, H; Guo, YM				Mi, Chunrong; Falk, Huettmann; Guo, Yumin			Climate envelope predictions indicate an enlarged suitable wintering distribution for Great Bustards (Otis tarda dybowskii) in China for the 21st century	PEERJ												The rapidly changing climate makes humans realize that there is a critical need to incorporate climate change adaptation into conservation planning. Whether the wintering habitats of Great Bustards (Otis tarda dybowskii), a globally endangered migratory subspecies whose population is approximately 1,500-2,200 individuals in China, would be still suitable in a changing climate environment, and where this could be found, is an important protection issue. In this study, we selected the most suitable species distribution model for bustards using climate envelopes from four machine learning models, combining two modelling approaches (TreeNet and Random Forest) with two sets of variables (correlated variables removed or not). We used common evaluation methods area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) and the True Skill Statistic (TSS) as well as independent test data to identify the most suitable model. As often found elsewhere, we found Random Forest with all environmental variables outperformed in all assessment methods. When we projected the best model to the latest IPCC-CMIP5 climate scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 in three Global Circulation Models (GCMs)), and averaged the project results of the three models, we found that suitable wintering habitats in the current bustard distribution would increase during the 21st century. The Northeast Plain and the south of North China were projected to become two major wintering areas for bustards. However, the models suggest that some currently suitable habitats will experience a reduction, such as Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River Basin. Although our results suggested that suitable habitats in China would widen with climate change, greater efforts should be undertaken to assess and mitigate unstudied human disturbance, such as pollution, hunting, agricultural development, infrastructure construction, habitat fragmentation, and oil and mine exploitation. All of these are negatively and intensely linked with global change.																			2167-8359					FEB 1	2016	4								e1630	10.7717/peerj.1630	http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.1630								26855870					WOS:000369408400003

Taxonomic diversity of microbial communities in the cold sulfur spring Bezymyanny (Pribaikalsky district, Republic of Buryatia)	VAVILOVSKII ZHURNAL GENETIKI I SELEKTSII												The environmental conditions of cold sulfur springs favor the growth and development of abundant and diverse microbial communities with many unique sulfur cycle bacteria. In this work, the taxonomic diversity of microbial communities of three different biotopes (microbial mat, bottom sediment, and water) in the cold sulfur spring Bezymyanny located on the shore of Lake Baikal (Pribaikalsky district, Republic of Buryatia) was studied using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. By sequencing the microbial mat, bottom sediment, and water samples, 76,972 sequences assigned to 1,714 ASVs (ASV, amplicon sequence variant) were obtained. Analysis of the ASV distribution by biotopes revealed a high percentage (66-93 %) of uniqueness in the three communities studied. An estimate of the alpha diversity index showed that bottom sediment community had higher indices, while microbial mat community was characterized by a lowest diversity. Bacteria of the phyla Pseudomonadota, Bacteroidota, Campylobacterota, Actinomycetota, Desulfobacterota dominated in different proportions in the studied communities. The features of the community structure of the studied biotopes were established. The microbial mat community was represented mainly by Thiothrix (43.2 %). The bottom sediment community was based on Sulfurovum (11.2 %) and co-dominated by unclassified taxa (3.2-1 %). Sequences assigned to the genera Novosphingobium, Nocardioides, Legionella, Brevundimonas, Sphingomonas, Bacillus, Mycobacterium, Sphingopyxis, Bradyrhizobium and Thiomicrorhabdus were found only in the water microbial community. Sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were identified in all the communities studied, which indicates the ongoing processes of the sulfur cycle in the Bezymyanny spring ecosystem. It should be noted that sequences of unclassified and uncultivated sulfur cycle bacteria were present in all communities and a significant proportion of sequences (20.3-53.9 %) were not classified.

J	Garduño-Paz, MV; Adams, CE; Verspoor, E; Knox, D; Harrod, C				Garduno-Paz, Monica V.; Adams, Colin E.; Verspoor, Eric; Knox, David; Harrod, Chris			Convergent evolutionary processes driven by foraging opportunity in two sympatric morph pairs of Arctic charr with contrasting post-glacial origins	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												The expression of two or more discrete phenotypes amongst individuals within a species (morphs) provides multiple modes upon which selection can act semi-independently, and thus may be an important stage in speciation. In the present study, we compared two sympatric morph systems aiming to address hypotheses related to their evolutionary origin. Arctic charr in sympatry in Loch Tay, Scotland, exhibit one of two discrete, alternative body size phenotypes at maturity (large or small body size). Arctic charr in Loch Awe segregate into two temporally segregated spawning groups (breeding in either spring or autumn). Mitochondrial DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis showed that the morph pairs in both lakes comprise separate gene pools, although segregation of the Loch Awe morphs is more subtle than that of Loch Tay. We conclude that the Loch Awe morphs diverged in situ (within the lake), whereas Loch Tay morphs most likely arose through multiple invasions by different ancestral groups that segregated before post-glacial invasion (i.e. in allopatry). Both morph pairs showed clear trophic segregation between planktonic and benthic resources (measured by stable isotope analysis) but this was significantly less distinct in Loch Tay than in Loch Awe. By contrast, both inter-morph morphological and life-history differences were more subtle in Loch Awe than in Loch Tay. The strong ecological but relatively weak morphological and life-history divergence of the in situ derived morphs compared to morphs with allopatric origins indicates a strong link between early ecological and subsequent genetic divergence of sympatric origin emerging species pairs. The emergence of parallel specialisms despite distinct genetic origins of these morph pairs suggests that the effect of available foraging opportunities may be at least as important as genetic origin in structuring sympatric divergence in post-glacial fishes with high levels of phenotypic plasticity.

Samples of Carex rostrata litter were submerged for 3 mo., in summer, in 2 lakes, 1 with an acidic and nutrient-poor water and 1 with near-neutral and nutrient-rich water. More plant litter remained (75%) in the former lake than in the latter (51-62%, varying with the mesh size of the litter bags used). The biomass of invertebrates in the litter samples from the acid lake was .apprx. 10 times less than in those from the near-neutral. Oligochaeta and Chironomidae were the dominant taxa found in the litter bags from the acidic lake; Hirudinea and Isopoda predominated in those from the near-neutral lake. Litter samples from 4 different plants (C. rostrata, Typha latifolia, Triticum sp. and Phleum pratense) were immersed in litter bags in another near-neutral lake further south for 12 mo. When recovered, .apprx. 45% of the Triticum litter remained compared with only 75 of the Phleum. The values for Carex and Typha fell between these 2 extremes. When expressed as per gram dry weight of residual plant litter, the greatest biomass of invertebrates was recorded in the Phleum litter samples and the least in the Typha samples. The faunal composition of the invertebrates in the different types of litter was approximately the same, with Isopoda and Hirudinea predominating.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1982	94	1					91	96		10.1007/BF00008636	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008636													WOS:A1982PK31200008
J	Devine, S; O'Geen, A				Devine, Scott; O'Geen, Anthony (Toby)			Climate-smart management of soil water storage: statewide analysis of California perennial crops	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The FAO-56 dual crop coefficient model was used to simulate site-specific irrigation management to quantify the green water resource (rainfall stored in soil) in five California perennial crops (alfalfa, almonds, grapes, pistachios, and walnuts), considering local soil water holding capacity and climate data from 2003 to 2018. We tested different rooting depths and irrigation management thresholds (allowable depletion) across 1.46 million hectares of cropland to determine how the size of the soil water reservoir affects green water utilization and, consequently, blue water demand (irrigation). The 13-year cumulative green water utilization ranged from 17 to 36 million km 3 out of a 57 km(3) rainfall input and 162-263 km(3) cumulative blue water demand. For a deep scenario (2 m rooting; 50% allowable depletion), green water met 12% of cumulative crop water demand. However, green water use was not uniform: 20% of the landscape met over 20% of its annual crop water demand. Deeper rooting or greater allowable depletion reduced blue water demand more than the increase in green water utilization, due to less frequent irrigations, which reduced soil evaporative loss. Compared to a 'business-as-usual' shallow irrigation management scenario (0.5 m rooting; 30% allowable depletion), a moderate scenario (1.0 m rooting; 50% allowable depletion) saved 30 km(3) blue water evaporation and increased green water use by 7 km(3) through 13 years. Such savings would fill California's largest reservoir, Shasta Lake, 6.6 times. This study demonstrates an opportunity for climate-smart management of soil water storage, by delayed spring irrigation, applying deeper irrigations less often, and ending fall irrigation early.

Total numbers of A. foliaceus, as well as the number of larval, juvenile and adult parasite stages, from each fish were recorded along with the fish species. Lice generally exhibited an aggregated distribution approximating a negative binomial distribution. Significant differences in the prevalence, intensity and intensity frequency distribution were observed between life history stages and between host species. In general, all life history stages of A. foliaceus exhibited an over-dispersed distribution. However, larval lice did show some degree of aggregation particularly within the stickleback samples. Infection data for parasite larval stages suggested that sticklebacks are more likely to be infected than other host species. For adult lice, however, carp appeared to be the main host. We propose that A. foliaceus infection characteristics are predominantly determined by the level of host exposure to the parasite and its life history stages (larval, juvenile and adult) rather than by an innate difference in host susceptibility related to individual host factors such as immune responses. We conclude that host exposure is determined by the parasite-host behavioural interplay related to species-specific ecology and behavioural traits such as microhabitat preference and normal swimming speed.					van der Velde, Gerard/C-7776-2011														0015-5683	1803-6465				JUN	2008	55	2					141	149		10.14411/fp.2008.019	http://dx.doi.org/10.14411/fp.2008.019								18666418					WOS:000257624400009

Characteristics of Seismicity in the Areas of Large Water Reservoirs and Waterfalls: The Role of Effects from Additional Load and Permanent Vibration	SEISMIC INSTRUMENTS												The characteristics of seismicity in the near vicinity of five large water reservoirs and three large waterfalls from different regions of the Earth are considered. It is found that in some cases induced seismicity manifests itself during the filling of reservoirs at quite large depths: in the lower crust and even in the upper mantle. There is negative correlation between the maximum magnitudes Demax of the earthquakes recorded near water reservoirs and waterfalls and the water discharge in these objects (V (p) ). The largest values of De (max) are characteristic of earthquakes that occurred near Sarez Lake (Tajikistan) and the Koyna Reservoir (India), which have the lowest V (p) ; in contrast, the smallest magnitudes are reported for earthquakes in the areas of the Khone Falls (Laos) and Niagara Falls (United States, Canada), where there are no large artificial water reservoirs, but huge water discharge takes place. The available data indicate that permanent vibration caused by falling water reduces the level of seismicity.

This small, shallow lake is located in a rapidly developing area of west Michigan. As such, our analytical approach and recommendations can serve as a model for other similar systems threatened by urbanization. Soluble reactive phosphorus and nitrate concentrations in both the inflows to (during baseflow) and Little Black Lake itself were low (<= 0.007 and <= 270 mg/L, respectively). Nutrient concentrations increased during stormflow conditions, although the magnitude of the increase depended on the nutrient and sampling location. Macrophyte growth was extensive throughout most parts of the lake, with Chara and Potamogeton spp. present in most sites; based on the coefficient of conservatism, plant composition was indicative of good water quality conditions. Chlorophyll a concentration averaged 1.7 mu g/L in Little Black Lake, with cryptophytes and cyanobacteria being the most dominant members (by biovolume) of the phytoplankton community. The fish community in Little Black Lake was dominated by bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and pumpkinseed (L. gibbosus), with no invasive species observed. Overall, abiotic and biotic conditions indicate that Little Black Lake is in good ecological health despite increasing pressures of urbanization in its watershed. To maintain this status, it is recommended that the local municipalities develop a comprehensive watershed management plan and implement best management practices to limit nonpoint source pollutant loading to Little Black Lake.

Some important and pending issues for understanding the hydrological processes in permafrost regions are how much melting water from thawing permafrost can feed the stream water and how the hydraulic connectivities will be altered under continual permafrost degradation. In this study, the Source Area of the Yellow River locating on the Northeast QTP was studied by using stable isotopic method and field hydrological observation. Results exhibited significant seasonal hydrological variations of stream water, thermokarst lakes, and ground ice. Hydrograph separation suggested that precipitation is the main contributor to stream water in ice-free months, accounting for 53.5% and 52.2% of the streams on average for the two branches, respectively. The second source is springs, which contributed about 29.8% and 17.9%. However, the recharge from melting ice is also important; it exported an average of 16.7% and 13.2% to the surface stream. Conceptual model and stable isotopes emphasized the remarkable hydraulic connectivities between the precipitation, stream water, thermokarst lakes, spring, and the near-surface ground ice. Current findings provide a basic understanding of the log-term hydrological processes under permafrost degradation, and can offer an efficient way to assess future hydrological changes and water resource protection.

Diel Surface Temperature Range Scales with Lake Size	PLOS ONE												Ecological and biogeochemical processes in lakes are strongly dependent upon water temperature. Long-term surface warming of many lakes is unequivocal, but little is known about the comparative magnitude of temperature variation at diel timescales, due to a lack of appropriately resolved data. Here we quantify the pattern and magnitude of diel temperature variability of surface waters using high-frequency data from 100 lakes. We show that the near-surface diel temperature range can be substantial in summer relative to long-term change and, for lakes smaller than 3 km(2), increases sharply and predictably with decreasing lake area. Most small lakes included in this study experience average summer diel ranges in their near-surface temperatures of between 4 and 7 degrees C. Large diel temperature fluctuations in the majority of lakes undoubtedly influence their structure, function and role in biogeochemical cycles, but the full implications remain largely unexplored.

J	Pouw, AF; Pour, HK; MacLean, A				Pouw, Alicia F.; Pour, Homa Kheyrollah; MacLean, Alex			Mapping snow depth on Canadian sub-arctic lakes using ground-penetrating radar	CRYOSPHERE												Ice thickness across lake ice is mainly influenced by the presence of snow and its distribution, which affects the rate of lake ice growth. The distribution of snow depth over lake ice varies due to wind redistribution and snowpack metamorphism, affecting the variability of lake ice thickness. Accurate and consistent snow depth data on lake ice are sparse and challenging to obtain. However, high spatial resolution lake snow depth observations are necessary for the next generation of thermodynamic lake ice models to improve the understanding of how the varying distribution of snow depth influences lake ice formation and growth. This study was conducted using ground-penetrating radar (GPR) acquisitions with similar to 9 cm sampling resolution along transects totalling similar to 44 km to map snow depth over four Canadian sub-arctic freshwater lakes. The lake snow depth derived from GPR two-way travel time (TWT) resulted in an average relative error of under 10% when compared to 2430 in situ snow depth observations for the early and late winter season. The snow depth derived from GPR TWTs for the early winter season was estimated with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.6 cm and a mean bias error of 0.01 cm, while the accuracy for the late winter season on a deeper snowpack was estimated with a RMSE of 2.9 cm and a mean bias error of 0.4 cm. The GPR-derived snow depths were interpolated to create 1m spatial resolution snow depth maps. The findings showed improved lake snow depth retrieval accuracy and introduced a fast and efficient method to obtain high spatial resolution snow depth information. The results suggest that GPR acquisitions can be used to derive lake snow depth, providing a viable alternative to manual snow depth monitoring methods. The findings can lead to an improved understanding of snow and lake ice interactions, which is essential for northern communities' safety and wellbeing and the scientific modelling community.

J	Davison, BJ; Sole, AJ; Livingstone, SJ; Cowton, TR; Nienow, PW				Davison, Benjamin Joseph; Sole, Andrew John; Livingstone, Stephen John; Cowton, Tom R.; Nienow, Peter William			The Influence of Hydrology on the Dynamics of Land-Terminating Sectors of the Greenland Ice Sheet	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Coupling between runoff, hydrology, basal motion, and mass loss ("hydrology-dynamics") is a critical component of the Greenland Ice Sheet system. Despite considerable research effort, the mechanisms by which runoff influences ice dynamics and the net long-term (decadal and longer) dynamical effect of variations in the timing and magnitude of runoff delivery to the bed remain a subject of debate. We synthesise key research into land-terminating ice sheet hydrology-dynamics, in order to reconcile several apparent contradictions that have recently arisen as understanding of the topic has developed. We suggest that meltwater interaction with subglacial channels, cavities, and deforming subglacial sediment modulates ice flow variability. Increasing surface runoff supply to the bed induces cavity expansion and sediment deformation, leading to early-melt season ice flow acceleration. In the ablation area, drainage of water at times of low runoff from high-pressure subglacial environments toward more efficient drainage pathways is thought to result in reductions in water pressure, ice-bed separation and sediment deformation, causing net slow-down on annual to decadal time-scales (ice flow self-regulation), despite increasing surface melt. Further inland, thicker ice, small surface gradients and reduced runoff suppress efficient drainage development, and a small net increase in both summer and winter ice flow is observed. Predicting icemotion across land-terminating sectors of the ice sheet over the twenty-first century is confounded by inadequate understanding of the processes and feedbacks between runoff and subglacial motion. However, if runoff supply increases, we suggest that ice flow in marginal regions will continue to decrease on annual and longer timescales, principally due to (i) increasing drainage system efficiency in marginal areas, (ii) progressive depression of basal water pressure, and (iii) thinning-induced lowering of driving stresses. At higher elevations, we suggest that minor year-on-year ice flow acceleration will continue and extend further into the interior where self-regulation mechanisms cannot operate and if surface-to-bed meltwater connections form. Based on current understanding, we expect that ice flow deceleration due to the seasonal development of efficient drainage beneath the land-terminating margins of the Greenland Ice Sheet will continue to regulate its future mass loss.																				2296-6463				FEB 21	2019	7								10	10.3389/feart.2019.00010	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2019.00010													WOS:000467221000001

Chilling Requirements to Relieve Bud Dormancy in Black-fruited Aronia Taxonomic Groups Is Related to Ploidy and Geographic Origin	HORTSCIENCE												The genus Aronia Medik., also known as chokeberry, is a group of deciduous shrubs in the Rosaceae family, subtribe Malinae. The two commonly accepted black-fruited Aronia species are black chokeberry [Aronia melanocarpa (Michx.) Elliott] and aroniaberry [Aronia mitschurinii (A.K. Skvortsov & Maitul)]. The geographic range of wild A. melanocarpa is the Great Lakes region and the northeastern United States, with a southerly extension into the higher elevations of the Appalachian Mountains. Wild A. melanocarpa found in New England are diploids, whereas plants throughout the rest of the range are tetraploids. A. mitschurinii is a cultivated hybrid between xSorbaronia fallax (C.K.Schneid.) C.K.Schneid. and A. melanocarpa and exists as a tetraploid. There is currently limited diversity of Aronia genotypes in the ornamental and fruit industries, and many of the current cultivars are not adapted to the southern United States and similar environs with limited chilling to break winter dormancy. The goal of this study was to determine 1) the chilling requirements for A. mitschurinii 'Viking' and 2) the range of chilling requirements for wild A. melanocarpa genotypes from different geographic origins. Two experiments were conducted in which plants were subjected to various chilling accumulation treatments and then moved to a greenhouse for observation of budbreak and subsequent growth. Expt. 1 was conducted at the University of Maryland at Wye, MD, and focused solely on the commercial cultivar A. mitschurinii 'Viking'. Outdoor, ambient fall and winter temperatures were used to achieve the chilling treatments. In Expt. 1, we determined the optimal chilling requirements for A. mitschurinii 'Viking' to be greater than 900 h using the single temperature model. Expt. 2 was conducted at the University of Connecticut and focused on wild genotypes, plus A. mitschurinii 'Viking'. A fixed temperature cold room was used to achieve chilling treatments. In Expt. 2, we found A. melanocarpa genotypes from southern regions in the United States required chilling accumulation of 600 h (single temperature model), compared with genotypes from northern regions that required more than 900 h of chilling accumulation. Tetraploid A. melanocarpa required 900 h of chilling to break bud, but diploid A. melanocarpa required 1200 h of chilling to break bud. Expt. 2 confirmed the 900-h chilling requirement for A. mitschurinii 'Viking'. For both experiments, the rate of budbreak and shoot growth was positively correlated with increasing amounts of chilling.

The rise and fall of Lake Bonneville between 45 and 10.5 ka	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					24th Pacific Climate Workshop (PACLIM)	APR 19-22, 2009	Pacific Grove, CA					A sediment core taken from the western edge of the Bonneville Basin has provided high-resolution proxy records of relative lake-size change for the period 45.1-10.5 calendar ka (hereafter ka). Age control was provided by a paleomagnetic secular variation (PSV)-based age model for Blue Lake core BL04-4. Continuous records of delta O-18 and total inorganic carbon (TIC) generally match an earlier lake-level envelope based on outcrops and geomorphic features, but with differences in the timing of some hydrologic events/states. The Stansbury Oscillation was found to consist of two oscillations centered on 25 and 24 ka. Lake Bonneville appears to have reached its geomorphic highstand and began spilling at 18.5 ka. The fall from the highstand to the Provo level occurred at 17.0 ka and the lake intermittently overflowed at the Provo level until 15.2 ka, at which time the lake fell again, bottoming out at similar to 14.7 ka. The lake also fell briefly below the Provo level at similar to 15.9 ka. Carbonate and delta O-18 data indicate that between 14.7 and 13.1 ka the lake slowly rose to the Gilbert shoreline and remained at about that elevation until 11.6 ka, when it fell again. Chemical and sedimentological data indicate that a marsh formed in the Blue Lake area at 10.5 ka. Relatively dry periods in the BL04-4 records are associated with Heinrich events H1-H4, suggesting that either the warming that closely followed a Heinrich event increased the evaporation rate in the Bonneville Basin and (or) that the core of the polar jet stream (PJS) shifted north of the Bonneville Basin in response to massive losses of ice from the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) during the Heinrich event. The second Stansbury Oscillation occurred during Heinrich event H2, and the Gilbert wet event occurred during the Younger Dryas cold interval. Several relatively wet events in BL04-4 occur during Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) warm events. The growth of the Bear River glacier between 32 and 17 ka paralleled changes in the values of proxy indicators of Bonneville Basin wetness and terminal moraines on the western side of the Wasatch Mountains have ages ranging from 16.9 to 15.2 ka. This suggests a near synchroneity of change in the hydrologic and cryologic balances occurring in the Bonneville drainage system and that glacial extent was linked to lake size.

Recent trends in Lake Ladoga ice cover	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The condition of the ice on a large lake is an important sensitive indicator of regional climate change. We have investigated the ice regime on Lake Ladoga using aircraft surveys and satellite images. Nearly 1,000 surveys of the lake's ice cover covering the years from 1943 to the present were analyzed to determine the first basic statistical characteristics of Ladoga ice cover based on long-term observation. The aim was to estimate long-term trends in the ice cover. Analysis showed that the average period of ice-cover formation is up to 1.5 times longer than the period of ice-cover destruction. The inter-annual trends in first and last ice dates, and in the duration of ice cover, are a few days per century, i.e. significant but rather small. We created the Relative Ice Cover Index (RICI), a dimensionless single-number variable that allowed the characteristics of winter seasons to be compared. A statistically significant downward trend of no more than 12% in RICI was observed over the 63-winter periods. The distribution of RICI was compared with the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAO) in an effort to explain the ice cover trend.

Trace metals were determined by Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometry for the Pb and the Cd and by Cold Vapor Atomic Absorption Spectrometry for the Hg. The results gotten from the study of the muscles of the different fish species show that the higher mean amounts of Cd and Hg were determined in E. lucius, and the maximum mean levels of Pb were detected in S. erythrophthalmus. Results suggested that demersal fishes inhabiting near the sediments and piscivorous fishes with higher trophic level were likely to accumulate higher trace metal concentrations. The general order of bioaccumulation of the trace metals measured in the muscles of the fish species is as follows: Hg > Pb > Cd. Therefore, the bioaccumulation of Hg in fish studied is more important than that of Cd and Pb. Furthermore, these concentrations are higher in summer than in winter for all trace metals. All the values of the trace metals in the muscle tissues are below the maximum limits recommended by the European Community (EC) N degrees 1881/2006. However, estimation of noncarcinogenic health risks by the target hazard quotient indicated no obvious noncarcinogenic risks to humans that consume those fishes (THQ < 1). Results of THQ and maximum safe consumption indicated that Hg may cause more harm to human by fish consumption especially for E. lucius and S. lucioperca. Therefore, reduced intake of carnivorous fishes should be promoted as part of a healthier diet.

FLOW CHARACTERIZATION IN THE SANTEE CAVE SYSTEM IN THE CHAPEL BRANCH CREEK WATERSHED, UPPER COASTAL PLAIN OF SOUTH CAROLINA, USA	JOURNAL OF CAVE AND KARST STUDIES												Karst watersheds possess both diffuse and conduit flow and varying degrees of connectivity between surface and groundwater over spatial scales that result in complex hydrology and contaminant transport processes. The flow regime and surface-groundwater connection must be properly identified and characterized to improve management in karst watersheds with impaired water bodies, such as the Chapel Branch Creek (CBC), South Carolina watershed, which has a long-temn sampling station presently listed on an EPA 303(d) list for phosphorous, pH, and nitrogen. Water from the carbonate limestone aquifer of the Santee Cave system and spring seeps in the CBC watershed were monitored to characterize dominant flow type and surface-groundwater connection by measuring dissolved calcium and magnesium, total suspended solids, volatile suspended solids, alkalinity, pH, specific conductance, and stable isotopes (delta O-18, delta H-2). These measurements indicated that the conduit flow to Santee Cave spring was recharged predominantly from diffuse flow, with a slow response of surface water infiltration to the conduit. Qualitative dye traces and stage elevation at Santee Cave spring and the adjacent Lake Marion (equal to the elevation of the flooded portion of CBC) also indicated a relation between fluctuating base level of the CBC reservoir-like embayment and elevation of the Santee Limestone karst aquifer at the spring. Methods described herein to characterize the flow type and surface-groundwater connection in the Santee Cave system can be applied not only to watershed management in the Chapel Branch Creek watershed, but also to the greater region where this carbonate limestone aquifer exists.					; James, April/D-1415-2012	James, April Lynda/0000-0002-1741-5101; 													1090-6924	2331-3714				AUG	2013	75	2					136	145		10.4311/2011ES0262	http://dx.doi.org/10.4311/2011ES0262													WOS:000325305600005

Fish were caught by gillnets of different mesh sizes once a month from April to December 1992. The gonad cycle showed that the spawning period occurred between October to December. Relative fecundity is about 2509 ovules per kg of female fish and ovule mean diameter is 4.7 mm (+/-0.6 mm). Seasonal variations of the sex-ratio (Max. in April = 2.67 and Min. in October = 0.19) indicated the intralake migrations of females and males. The condition coefficients showed higher values for females than males; the maximum was observed in summer for both sexes and the minimum in April and in October for males and females, respectively. Low values of the condition were also observed during the spawning period. High feeding activity was recorded in spring and in December after reproduction; low feeding activity was observed in October during reproduction. Asellus aquaticus was quantitatively the dominant prey from April to September; during the spawning period, S. alpinus consumed its own eggs, particularly in large quantity in December. Daphnia longispina was numerically the dominant prey all over the studied cycle and the electivity (Ivlev Index) of arctic charr on the latter prey ranged from +0.79 to +0.16. During April more than 15 500 individuals of D. longispina per Lo nf fish were found in the guts contents. The selective predation of S. alpinus on benthic (A. aquaticus) and zooplankton prey (D. longispina) indicated that the fish immigrate during their feeding activity from benthic/littoral to the pelagic area.

Genetic analyses were performed on 1,016 wild rainbow trout collected between 1993 and 1996 from the mainstem and in 8 tributaries. Wild trout genotypes were compared to genotypes for 79 Mount Shasta Hatchery rainbow trout. No genetic heterogeneity was found 2 years after the spill (1993) between tributary populations and geographically proximate mainstem fish, suggesting recolonization of the upper mainstem directly from adjacent tributaries. Trout collections made in 1996 showed significant year-class genetic variation for mtDNA and microsatellites when compared to fish from the same locations in 1993. Five years after the spill, mainstem populations appeared genetically mixed with no significant allelic frequency differences between mainstem populations and geographically proximate tributary trout. In our 1996 samples, we found no significant genetic differences due to season of capture (summer or fall) or sampling technique used to capture rainbow trout, with the exception of trout collected by electrofishing and hook and line near Prospect Avenue. Haplotype and allelic frequencies in wild rainbow trout populations captured in the upper Sacramento River and its tributaries were found to differ genetically from Mount Shasta Hatchery trout for both years, with the notable exception of trout collected in the lower mainstem river near Shasta Lake, where mtDNA and microsatellite data both suggested upstream colonization by hatchery fish from the reservoir, These data suggest that the chemical spill in the upper Sacramento River produced significant effects over time on the genetic population structure of rainbow trout throughout the entire upper river basin.																			0008-1078	2331-0405				WIN	2000	86	1					21	40																WOS:000090116300003

Trends and Synchrony in Black Bass and Crappie Recruitment in Missouri Reservoirs	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides, Spotted Bass M. punctulatus, White Crappie Pomoxis annularis, and Black Crappie P. nigromaculatus are popular components of many large reservoir sport fisheries, and a better understanding of these populations and their dynamics would improve our management capabilities. We used long-term datasets (13-37years) collected from 15 Missouri reservoirs to assess temporal trends and synchrony in sport fish recruitment by using catch per unit effort of age-1 (CPUE1) black bass Micropterus spp. during spring electrofishing (N/h) and CPUE1 of crappies Pomoxis spp. during fall trap-netting (N/net-night) as our index of recruitment. Although CPUE1 exhibited high interannual variation within a reservoir, time series analysis revealed only two significant trends for each of the black bass species, with all trends indicating increasing recruitment. White Crappie CPUE1 showed abrupt declines in all four reservoirs in the Osage River basin, with these declines occurring in different years in each reservoir. White Crappie CPUE1 in one northern reservoir and Black Crappie CPUE1 in all reservoirs appeared to be increasing over time. Within a species, some regional synchrony in CPUE1 occurred for Largemouth Bass, White Crappie, and Black Crappie but not for Spotted Bass. However, synchrony within a species was not universal and in some cases did not exist even among arms within large reservoirs. With few exceptions, there was little evidence for synchronous recruitment among species; those that occurred were among congeners. The lack of synchrony among black bass and crappie recruitment suggests that management practices designed to improve recruitment of one species may not enhance the recruitment of another species.

Kenyon			Abundance and Habitat Selection of Breeding Scoters (Melanitta spp.) in Ontario's Hudson Bay Lowlands	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												Concern about declining populations of sea ducks counted on the wintering grounds prompted a survey of sea ducks on the breeding grounds in the Hudson Bay Lowlands of Ontario in spring 2009. We estimated densities of breeding scoters (Surf Scoter, Melanitta perspicillata, White-winged Scoter, M. fusca, and Black Scoter, M. americana) and found the average estimates of Surf Scoters ((x) over bar = 0.11 indicated pairs/km(2)) and Black Scoters ((x) over bar = 0.16 indicated pairs/km(2)) to be as high as some of the highest reported for North America. We also conducted a habitat association analysis using resource selection functions (RSF) for indicated pairs of all scoter species combined at a scale of 250 m. Breeding pairs of scoters in the Hudson Bay Lowlands appear to have an affinity for smaller wetlands (<= 100 ha) disproportionate to what is available, also avoiding lakes (i.e., wetlands > 100 ha). Pairs were also found in areas with less forest cover and fen area than was available. An estimate of the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic suggests that these habitat association models have sonic utility. Once tested and validated with surveys beyond the current study area, these models can be refined and used to predict habitat use by breeding pairs of scoters in the Hudson Bay Lowlands; this information will be particularly useful for population estimation and land use planning.																			0008-3550					JAN-MAR	2012	126	1					20	27		10.22621/cfn.v126i1.1290	http://dx.doi.org/10.22621/cfn.v126i1.1290													WOS:000310094200004

Of increasing relevance is to further our understanding on biological responses to pulse disturbances (short duration) and how they interact with other ongoing press disturbances (constantly present). Because the temporal and spatial contexts of single experiments often limit our ability to generalize results across space and time, we conducted a modularized mesocosm experiment replicated in space (five lakes along a latitudinal gradient in Scandinavia) and time (two seasons, spring and summer) to generate general predictions on how the functioning and composition of multitrophic plankton communities (zoo-, phyto- and bacterioplankton) respond to pulse disturbances acting either in isolation or combined with press disturbances. As pulse disturbance, we used short-term changes in fish presence, and as press disturbance, we addressed the ongoing reduction in light availability caused by increased cloudiness and lake browning in many boreal and subarctic lakes. First, our results show that the top-down pulse disturbance had the strongest effects on both functioning and composition of the three trophic levels across sites and seasons, with signs for interactive impacts with the bottom-up press disturbance on phytoplankton communities. Second, community composition responses to disturbances were highly divergent between lakes and seasons: temporal accumulated community turnover of the same trophic level either increased (destabilization) or decreased (stabilization) in response to the disturbances compared to control conditions. Third, we found functional recovery from the pulse disturbances to be frequent at the end of most experiments. In a broader context, these results demonstrate that top-down, pulse disturbances, either alone or with additional constant stress upon primary producers caused by bottom-up disturbances, can induce profound but often functionally reversible changes across multiple trophic levels, which are strongly linked to spatial and temporal context dependencies. Furthermore, the identified dichotomy of disturbance effects on the turnover in community composition demonstrates the potential of disturbances to either stabilize or destabilize biodiversity patterns over time across a wide range of environmental conditions.					; Langenheder, Silke/C-9614-2017; Hillebrand, Helmut/I-1717-2014; Striebel, Maren/AAF-9996-2019; Laudon, Hjalmar/J-3074-2013; Hansson, Lars-Anders/HCI-2735-2022	Urrutia Cordero, Pablo/0000-0001-9560-8374; Striebel, Maren/0000-0003-2061-2154; Angeler, David/0000-0003-2197-7470; Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317; 													0012-9658	1939-9170				APR	2021	102	4								10.1002/ecy.3283	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.3283		FEB 2021						33428769					WOS:000623058600001

Hydrogeological implications of glacial landscape evolution at Skeioararsandur, SE Iceland	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Patterns of groundwater recharge and flow in present day and palaeo-glacial environments are governed by both geomorphology and subsurface sedimentology. This paper assesses the hydrogeological implications of glacial landscape evolution and develops a conceptual model of glacial landscape evolution and hydrogeological interaction. The ice-marginal zone of Skeioararsandur, SE Iceland was selected as a case study of a temperate, actively-receding glacier landsystem that is affected by both surging behaviour and periodic glacier outburst floods (jokulhlaups). The groundwater table elevation was measured approximately every 2-5 days throughout two six-week summer field seasons in 2000 and 200 1, and once in March 200 1, using a network of shallow piezometers, and hydraulic conductivity was calculated based on grain-size distribution analysis of sampled aquifer materials. The hydraulic conductivity of the near surface aquifer at the study site spans three orders of magnitude and is highest and most varied in areas inundated by the November 1996 jokulhlaup. The shallow water table in the study area responds dynamically to precipitation events with the greatest fluctuation in an enclosed moraine lake basin with a perched aquifer underlain by ice and in a zone of outwash fans proximal to the ice margin. The seasonal decline in water table is greatest at the ice margin, reflecting the reduced winter recharge from the stagnant ice zone. Landsystems with morainic relief are associated with localised moraine/precipitation-fed groundwater systems. These localised groundwater systems are superimposed on the intermediate/ regional scale groundwater systems that discharge further down sandur and offshore and are dominated by the gently-sloping geomorphologically-uniform outwash plain. Groundwater-fed lakes, formed in depressions from ice blocks deposited during jokulhaups, may provide important ecological niches. The investigations at this site demonstrate that glacial outburst floods and Glacier margin fluctuations produce a suite of sediments, landforms and environments that affect the hydrogeological system.

Life cycle of Dero (Aulophorus) costatus Marcus, 1944 (Turificidae, Oligochaeta) in a vegetated pond at Lostalas, Argentina	GAYANA												The life cycle (March 1996-March 1997) of Dero (Aulophorus) costatus was studied in a vegetated pond located at Los Talas, Argentina. A change in the composition of the vegetation cover -developing Azolla sp- produced the displacement of Allonais lairdi by the species here studied. Inmature, mature and asexually reproductive specimens, forming chains of two zooids, were colected. Length, wet and dry weight (65 degrees C, 24 h) of the organisms were registred. The spatial dispersion of the individuals, analyzed according to Morisita's Index, showed a random distribution. The population density fluctuated during the study (1.58 to 101.97 ind./g.d.w.vegetal.m(2)) due to an asexual reproduction, and two peaks of abundance were registred, in April, after a period of intense asexual reproduction and in December. The abundance was correlated with the water temperature (Pearson coefficient r = 0.5906, p < 0.05) and especially with the plant biomass (r = 0.9211, p < 0.001). The organisms sexually mature were found in spring and at the beginning of summer (from October to January), comprising a low proportion (4.86 %) of the population. Based oil the sizes and weights of the individuals measured, the sucession of three cohorts was estimated: the first one developed from October to November (including the period of sexual maturation of the organisms), a second one from December to February and the last one in March.

Here, the seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton and micro-eukaryotic diversities and their co-existence patterns were studied in a drinking water reservoir, Northwest China. The highest phytoplankton diversity was observed in summer, and Chlorella sp. that belongs to Chlorophyta was the most abundant genus. The highest eukaryotic diversity was also detected in summer, and Rimostrombidium sp. that belongs to Ciliophora was the most dominant genus. Mantel test showed that the phytoplankton diversity was significantly correlated with ammonia nitrogen (r = 0.561, p = 0.001) and dissolved organic carbon (r = 0.267, p = 0.017), while the eukaryotic diversity was significantly associated with ammonia nitrogen (r = 0.265, p = 0.034) and temperature (r = 0.208, p = 0.046). PLS-PM (Partial Least Squares Path Modeling) further revealed that nutrients (P < 0.01) significantly affected the phytoplankton diversity, while nutrients (P < 0.01) and temperature (P < 0.01) significantly influenced the eukaryotic diversity. Cooccurrence network displayed the primarily positive interactions (77.66% positive and 22.34% negative) between phytoplankton and micro-eukaryotes. These findings could deepen our understanding of interactions between phytoplankton and micro-eukaryotes and their driving factors under changing aquatic environments of drinking water reservoirs.

J	Chidami, S; Amyot, M				Chidami, Saad; Amyot, Marc			Fish decomposition in boreal lakes and biogeochemical implications	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A field study in a boreal lake using a remotely operated vehicle equipped with a camera established that falling fish carcasses did not tend to be buried in sediments after deposition. Decomposition rates of fish carcasses in three boreal lakes were experimentally assessed at different depths. In shallow waters (between 0 and 4 m), decomposition was fast (half lives, tau, ranging from 40 to 230 h) and controlled by vertebrates. In deep waters (below the thermocline), decomposition was slow (tau between 770 and 1,733 h) and was controlled by bacterial processes. Water temperature was a promising predictor of decomposition half-lives in freshwater. Using a novel underwater infrared camera system, we identified the daily and seasonal patterns of scavenging activity by littoral fish. Only three species displayed scavenging behavior, with creek chubs being the most active. Fast fish-mediated littoral recycling of fish carcass may explain the lack of direct observations of carcasses in lakes. Estimates of phosphorus fluxes in one of the studied lakes indicate that falling carcasses can represent a significant water-to-sediment flux of nutrient.

A.; Zhukov, O., V			Application of remote sensing data for monitoring eutrophication of floodplain water bodies	BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY												The aim of this article was to investigate the influence of structural features of the floodplain water network on the spatial and temporal dynamics of chlorophyll-a concentration as an indicator of eutrophication. The research was conducted in the waters of the "Dnipro-Orilskiy" Nature Reserve. The geographic information base with polygonal objects which represented water bodies of the reserve was created on the basis of detailed geographical maps and the high resolution space images. The water bodies were characterized using such parameters as the distance of the water body centroid from the nearest shore of the Dnipro River, the area of the water body, the order of the water body and the connectivity of the water body. Chlorophyll-a concentration was estimated based on the surface algal bloom index The information was obtained about 148 water bodies, 141 of which are water bodies in the floodplain of the Dnipro River. The area of floodplain water bodies within the reserve was 328 million m(2). The area of floodplain water bodies ranged from 300-232,500 m(2). Trophic State Index allows us to estimate the trophic level of Dnipro River waters as mesotrophic, water bodies of first and second order as eutrophic, and water bodies of third and fourth order as hypereutrophic. The dynamics of chlorophyll-a content in water followed the seasonal course of temperatures. The concentration was lowest in the cold period of the year and reached its maximum in the second half of summer. The autumn decrease occurred at the end of September. The seasonal course of air temperature was superimposed on the peculiarities of the temperature regime of a particular water body, which depended on its depth and flow rate. The time, water body area, distance from the Dnipro River channel, connectivity and order of water bodies were the statistically significant predictors of chlorophyll concentration in water and were able to explain 85% of the variation of this indicator. The increase in chlorophyll-a concentration with increasing order of a water body is due to a decrease in the intensity of water exchange and a decrease in the depth of water bodies of higher order. An increase in the order of a water body is accompanied by a branching network of water bodies, the ability of water bodies to clear sediments decreases. Sediment accumulation leads to a decrease in their depth. Warming of shallow ponds and accumulation of organic matter in them are factors of intensive growth of blue-green algae. The evacuation of surplus organic matter, which results from mass vegetation development with excessive nutrient inputs, is a key driver of the eutrophic regime of water bodies. The increasing importance of regulatory processes develops in agreement with an increase in chlorophyll-a concentration in a water body. The importance of the considered factors reaches the highest level in summer time, when simultaneous maximum warming of water bodies and minimum water level in them take place. Accordingly, the differences between deep and relatively cool water bodies and shallow water bodies that warm up quickly, which significantly stimulates the growth of organic mass, reach the greatest contrast. The spatial patterns of variation in chlorophylla concentration have a complex multiscale structure, indicating the multiple nature of the acting factors. The spatial variability was represented as a composition of broad-scale and medium-scale spatial processes. The broad-scale process is most dependent on connectivity, whereas for the medium-scale process the leading one is the effect of water body order.

From the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analyses on the surface temperature, this study found two modes to be closely related to the decrease of rainfall over the peninsula. The first (second) EOF mode is associated with the enhanced surface temperature and anticyclonic circulation over the eastern Lake Baikal to northeastern China (the far East of Russia). The second mode also appears to be related to the cyclonic circulation over the East China Sea and south of Japan islands. These circulation patterns induce southeastward or eastward water vapor transports, and then contribute to the decreased moisture flux convergence and rainfall over Korea. In conclusion, the recent decrease of June rainfall over the Korean peninsula is thought to be, in part, associated with changes in the East Asian Summer Monsoon circulation possibly caused by the local warming trends over the eastern Lake Baikal to Mongolia and far East of Russia.

J	Ridge, JC				Ridge, JC			Shed Brook Discontinuity and Little Falls Gravel: Evidence for the Erie interstade in central New York	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												The Shed Brook Discontinuity in the western Mohawk Valley region of central New York is an unconformity separating lacustrine beds of the Valley Heads drift (Port Bruce stade) from pre-Valley Heads lacustrine deposits (Nissouri stade). The Little Falls Gravel is a fluvial unit that can be found draped by Valley Heads lacustrine deposits in the Mohawk Valley. The discontinuity and gravel represent subaerial erosion and braided river deposition in response to initial late Wisconsinan ice recession and lake drainage in the Mohawk Valley. These events were followed by Valley Heads lake impoundment and glacial readvances. The Shed Brook Discontinuity and Little Falls Gravel have a C-14 age constrained to 17-14.1 ka on the basis of stratigraphic relationships in central New York and the correlation of paleomagnetic declination records from central New York and the C-14-calibrated New England varve chronology. The Shed Brook Discontinuity and Little Falls Gravel appear to be features equivalent in age to the Erie interstade (about 14.5-16 ka), an interval during which eastward drainage to the Mohawk Valley has been inferred for lakes in the Erie basin. Evidence for a river in the Mohawk Valley (Little Falls Gravel) indicates that it may have served as an eastern outlet for the Erie and Ontario basins, and thus allowed the first eastward diversion of meltwater away from the Mississippi Valley during the last deglaciation. Drainage down the Mohawk Valley entered Lake Albany in the Hudson Valley, which drained into Long Island Sound and not along the present Hudson River course to the New Jersey continental shelf. Meltwater drainage across New York during the latest stages of the Erie interstade may have introduced large volumes of melt-water directly to the western Atlantic, creating a situation that needs to be more fully explored in terms of its possible influence on thermohaline circulation in the North Atlantic and climatic change marked by the Port Bruce stade.																			0016-7606	1943-2674				JUN	1997	109	6					652	665		10.1130/0016-7606(1997)109<0652:SBDALF>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0016-7606(1997)109<0652:SBDALF>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1997XC64300003
J	Moran, MA; Zepp, RG				Moran, MA; Zepp, RG			Role of photoreactions in the formation of biologically labile compounds from dissolved organic matter	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) can be degraded by sunlight into a variety of photoproducts that stimulate the growth and activity of microorganisms in aquatic environments. All biologically labile photoproducts identified to date fall into one of four categories: (1) low-molecular-weight (MW) organic compounds (carbonyl compounds with MW of <200); (2) carbon gases (primarily CO); (3) unidentified bleached organic matter; and (4) nitrogen- and phosphorus-rich compounds (including NH4+ and PO43-). A number of laboratory studies using bacterial bioassay approaches have shown that the photochemical breakdown of DOM can stimulate biomass production or activity by 1.5- to 6-fold. Results of photochemical studies, extrapolated to estimate formation rates of biologically available photoproducts from DOM in surface waters, also predict important biological roles for these compounds. In a continental shelf system, for example, full exposure of surface seawater to sunlight for one summer day can produce DOM photodegradation products equivalent to >20% of the bacterial carbon demand. Likewise, 30% of the bacterial nitrogen demand can be met by photodegradation of the nitrogen components of DOM, a process likely to be of particular importance in nitrogen-limited systems. When considered on a depth-integrated basis around the globe, at least 1.0 x 10(15) g C and 0.15 x 10(15) g N are estimated to be available annually for utilization by planktonic microorganisms through the conversion of light-absorbing fractions of DOM to more biologically labile compounds. By comparison, direct photochemical mineralization of DOM is estimated to convert 12-16 x 10(15) g C to CO2 annually.					; Moran, Mary/B-6939-2012	Moran, Mary Ann/0000-0002-0702-8167; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	1997	42	6					1307	1316		10.4319/lo.1997.42.6.1307	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1997.42.6.1307													WOS:000071910200001
J	Kangur, K; Kangur, A; Kangur, P				Kangur, K; Kangur, A; Kangur, P			A comparative study on the feeding of eel, Anguilla anguilla (L.), bream, Abramis brama (L.) and ruffe, Gymnocephalus cernuus (L.) in Lake Vortsjarv, Estonia	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Conference on Trophic Interactions in Shallow Freshwater and Brackish Waterbodies	AUG 03-08, 1998	BLOSSIN, GERMANY	Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisher, Tech Univ Cottbus				The stomach contents of eel, bream and ruffe were examined in order to detect the diet overlap and possible food competition between these benthophagous fishes in the eutrophic Lake Vortsjarv. The frequency of occurrence, mean number and mean restored weight of food items per individual were used for the description of their diet. Overlap in diet of bream (standard length > 15 cm), eel (SL > 30 cm) and ruffe (SL > 4.5 cm) appeared mostly in respect of Chironomus plumosus (L.) larvae and pupae, which may lead to food competition between these fishes. However, these fishes can eat different chironomid instars. Unlike eel, who takes mainly large fourth-instar larvae and pupae of C. plumosus, ruffe and bream eat, in addition, small third- and second-instar larvae of this species as well as other small-sized chironomids, mainly Einfeldia carbonaria (Meig.), Microchironomus tener (Kieff.) and Procladius spp. Obviously, even if the overlap was pronounced, serious competitive interactions would arise only in case of limited food resources in the years with a low biomass of C. plumosus. A significant correlation (r=0.88; P < 0.05) was found between the mean biomass of fourth-instar larvae of C. plumosus in the lake sediment and in the stomach of ruffe in different years. The diet composition of ruffe was more diverse (including a wide range of invertebrates, fish ova and detritus) than that of eel and bream. Evidently, omnivorous mode of feeding provides ruffe with an advantage over other benthophagous fishes living in the lake. Unlike eel and bream, ruffe continued to take food in late autumn and winter when water temperature in L. Vortsjarv decreased to 2-0.2 degrees C.

J	Konrad, SK; Clark, DH				Konrad, SK; Clark, DH			Evidence for an early Neoglaciol glacier advance from rock glaciers Rind Lake sediments in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA	ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Lichenometric ages of active glacigenic rock glaciers and Matthes (Little Ice Age) moraines, together with sediment cores from basins below these landforms, provide evidence for a glacier advance similar to 3000 yr ago in the Sierra Nevada, California. Diameters of the largest lichens (70-108 rmn) on the Mendel rock glacier indicate that it began forming well before the onset of the Little Ice Age (LIA) (similar to 700 yr BP). Smaller Lichens (30-45 mm) on the Matthes moraines of Darwin and Conness glaciers suggest that they formed during the LIA. The apparent lack of pre-LIA Holocene moraines below "clean" glaciers in the Sierra Nevada demonstrates that the pre-LIA Neoglacial advance must have been less extensive than the Matthes advance. Sediment cores recovered below Matthes glacial deposits provide additional support for a pre-LIA Neoglacial advance. Three cares from a meadow directly below the Powell rock glacier record grus deposition (suggesting nonglacial, summer-dominant mass wasting) between about 5300 and 3600 C-14 yr BP (similar to 6000-3900 cal yr BP), and alternating gyttja and silt (suggesting cooler, winter-dominated precipitation) after about 3600 C-14 yr BP (3900 cal yr BP). A lake core from below Conness Glacier shows a transition from higher-organic sediments (10-16% total organic carbon) to lower-organic sediments (2-4% total organic carbon) at approximately 3200 C-14 yr BP (3400 cal yr BP), suggesting formation and growth of the glacier in the cirque at that time.

Optimal foragers would weigh habitat quality by giving-up net energy intake rate (GUN), which includes the energy intake rate and cost rate. The GUNs, energy intake rate, and cost rate can be influenced by variations in different microhabitat factors and interactive effects. In this study, we assessed the GUN patterns of wintering Bewick's swans and the effects of microhabitat factors on their foraging strategy in three different habitats: foxnut ponds, paddy fields, and shallow lake. The foraging behaviors and microhabitat variables of the swans were investigated during the winters of 2016-2018 and 2017/2018 at Huangpi and Shengjin Lakes in Anhui Province, southeastern China. The results showed that the percentage of disturbance time and the giving-up food density in shallow water had significant negative effects on GUNs. In contrast, water depth and the giving-up food density in deep water showed positive effects on GUNs. GUNs were significantly different among the three habitats. GUNs also decreased as winter progressed. Swans would decrease their GUNs under unfavorable foraging conditions such as more disturbances; however, GUNs would increase with water depth and food availability in patches with deep water. The swans demonstrated diverse GUN patterns in different foraging habitats, driven by the tradeoffs between energy intake rates and energy cost rates that were influenced by microhabitat variables. It implies that waterbirds exposed to decreasing GUNs may mitigate energy demand and environmental stress by switching foraging habitat while in subprime foraging habitat if alternative habitats that offered higher net rates of energy gain were available.

J	Gardarsson, A				Gardarsson, Arnthor			Harlequin Ducks in Iceland	WATERBIRDS												In Iceland, the Harlequin Duck (Histrionicus histrionicus) is generally distributed as a breeder oil rapA clear-water streams, from sea level to about 700 in. Densities are generally low, except at the headwaters of streams draining productive lakes where blackflies (Simulium vittalum) are abundant. In northwest, north and cast Iceland, molting Harlequin Ducks are found in similar localities as the wintering birds, but molting birds are largely absent front the southwest coast. During the molt, the birds often stay close to cliffs or rocks and are hard to find. Harlequin Ducks winter oil exposed rocky coasts and densities are correlated with substrate as indicated by shore exposure. In 1998-2001, the total wintering population of Harlequin Ducks in Iceland was estimated at 14,000, with 95% confidence limits of 12,000 to 16,000. Assuming that migration in and out. Of Iceland is insignificant, the total Icelandic breeding Population is 3,000-5,000 females, or three to five females (pairs) 100 km(-2). A decline in wintering numbers was found in southwest Iceland in 1961-2002, but. numbers in the northeast have increased. This may be related to increased temperatures, but changes in exploitation may also have affected the population. The conservation of the Icelandic population of the Harlequin Duck is largely a matter of wise use of the coast and streams Which Should include preemptive measures, such as minimizing pollution and development. Small-scale river-development for power production and salmon fishing pose potential threats to Harlequin Ducks, but direct exploitation Of this population is not likely.																			1524-4695	1938-5390					2008	31				2		8	14																WOS:000263006600003

The activities of 3 enzyme systems, L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), proteases and NADH2-dependent dehydrogenases, in zooplankton are not affected by freezing or freeze-drying, or by storage below -18.degree. C. The half-life time of LDH in freeze-dried material is 280 days at room temperature, and 3 h at 80.degree. C. When frozen or freeze-dried zooplankton material is introduced into water, enzyme activity is rapidly lost. After 10 min at 9.degree. C, only 27% of the original LDH activity remain in the plankton material; the rest can be recovered in the incubation medium. Nearly all the free and about 13 of free plus protein-bound amino acids are lost from plankton samples incubated for 1 h. The leaching experiments suggest the presence of unknown, non-protein sources of bound citrulline and histidine in the plankton. During the process of leaking nearly all of the bound lysine and arginine are liberated from plankton proteins by the action of the still viable proteases. Pelleting freeze-dried plankton reduces the rate of leaching considerably. After 10 min in water at 9.degree. C, .apprx. 85% of the original LDH activity can still be found in the potential food material.																			0044-8486	1873-5622					1981	26	1-2					85	94		10.1016/0044-8486(81)90112-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0044-8486(81)90112-5													WOS:A1981MR34600008

During the last two decades several paleoenvironmental studies have increased our knowledge of past shifts in the desert-grassland border in the deserts of northeastern China. However, studies of Holocene vegetation changes with high-quality age data are scarce. Here, we present the results of optically stimulated luminescence dating and analyses of magnetic susceptibility, total organic carbon and the stable carbon isotope composition of organic matter, and inferred C-4 biomass, of the paleosol sequences of the Tuquan and Mutougou sections in the Horqin desert and utilize them to document Holocene environmental changes in the region. The results reveal that the East Asian summer monsoon precipitation gradually increased and previously unstable dunes were semi-stabilized from similar to 11 to 9 ka. The semiarid conditions were then replaced by the more humid environment of the Holocene climatic optimum from similar to 9 to 5 ka. During the Holocene climatic optimum, the paleosols in the Tuquan and Mutougou sections developed, and the percentage of C-4 plants increased and the dunes in the Horqin desert were extensively stabilized. Subsequently, alternation of eolian sand mobilization and paleosol development occurred, indicating that the environment became cold and dry, with temporary wet and warm stages. Estimates of C-4 biomass from the two sections demonstrate that the favorable growing conditions for C-4 plants extended to at least 45 degrees N in North China during the Holocene. We conclude that Holocene environmental changes in the Horqin desert were controlled by movements of the East Asian summer monsoon rainfall belt on a millennial time scale, and that human activity also played a significant role in environmental change during the late Holocene.

Seasonal variation and health risk assessment of organophosphate esters in surface and drinking water in Nanjing, China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Purification of tap water sourced from river water is a complex process, and little is known about the concentration change in organophosphate esters (OPEs) in this process. The aim of our study was to investigate the levels and seasonal variability of OPEs from surface to drinking water and clarify the health risk of tap water in Nanjing, China. From April 2017 to February 2018, surface (including river and source water) and drinking water (including effluent and tap water) samples were collected, and every point was sampled in four seasons. Twelve OPEs of water were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Mann-Whitney U test, spearman correlation analysis and principal component analysis were conducted. High median concentrations of total OPEs (sigma OPEs) were both found in surface (601.88 ng/L) and drinking water (608.26 ng/L). Compared to surface water, the levels of most compounds in drinking water made no change except trimethyl phosphate and triphenyl phosphate. The highest levels of sigma OPEs were found in winter in both types of water. Spearman correlations and principal component analysis showed the different sources of OPEs in surface and drinking water. There was no carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risk of OPEs in tap water, but higher risk was found in winter. This study provided important information on the levels of OPEs from surface to drinking water in Nanjing, and suggested more attention on the potential human health risk.					; Yuan, Yucheng/KHZ-3048-2024	Wang, Tong/0000-0002-5902-9102; jin, jing/0000-0002-3207-4077; 													1735-1472	1735-2630				JAN	2023	20	1					411	422		10.1007/s13762-022-03987-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-022-03987-2		FEB 2022											WOS:000757335500004

Multiple environmental and water quality parameters, recorded over a 4.5-year period, were correlated against membrane permeance, cleaning frequency, and useful life. Membrane autopsies enabled the characterization of the foulant composition. Temporal variations in temperature at plant X led to significant biofouling (manifested by permeance losses of 30-50%, and bacteria detected on the membrane surface) during the summer months, when water temperatures exceeded 20 degrees C and microbiological activity was highest. Plant Y, in contrast, displayed smaller seasonal variations and was operationally stable without significant fouling. A pronounced increase in manganese and iron (up to 200 and 600 mu g/L, respectively) in the lake water at plant X in summer was accompanied by elevated content (similar to 60 mg/m2) of those metals on the membrane surface, which was consistent with lake thermal stratification and metal input from the sediment into the water column. Our work shows that membrane plants in regions supplied by standing surface water bodies, such as plant X, are more vulnerable to biofouling, especially during warmer months.					; Castrillón, Santiago/F-1691-2013	Romero-Vargas Castrillon, Santiago/0000-0003-3339-7692; 														2690-0637				OCT 29	2024	4	11					5002	5012		10.1021/acsestwater.4c00630	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsestwater.4c00630		OCT 2024						39539761					WOS:001344903400001

Despite this, decadal- to centennial-scale EASM dynamics remain poorly understood over the last millennium. Here we used high-resolution benthic microfossil proxies to reconstruct EASM variability for the last 1,000 years from a brackish lake in South Korea. We compared this EASM record with Asian Monsoon proxy records from East China (i.e., continental proxy) and East Asian coasts (i.e., oceanic setting), and identified four pervasive EASM strengthening events at 1250, 1450, 1550, and 1900 CE and their deviation, likely related to land-ocean temperature gradients. Our results indicate that data from the oceanic setting under the direct influence of the Pacific High are important in understanding the EASM dynamics over the last millennium. It is also noteworthy that EASM variability shows striking similarity to changes in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, implying the causal relationship. Plain Language Summary The East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) is a determining factor of regional precipitation in East Asia that subsequently affects socioeconomic activities of regional populations. However, spatiotemporal trends of decadal- to centennial-scale EASM strength over the last millennium remain poorly understood, even with precisely dated Chinese stalagmite records. Here we use microfossil proxies in a brackish lake sediment core from the East Asian coast to better understand EASM dynamics for the last 1,000 years. We identified four pervasive EASM strengthening events at 1250, 1450, 1550, and 1900 CE and found that oceanic and continental settings could partially explain spatial differences in Asian summer monsoon trends at this scale. In addition, we found that global ocean circulation was weakened during these EASM events. Our results help to better understand Asian monsoon dynamics in the past, present, and future in this rapidly changing planet.

Initially, numerous experimental plots were set up to study the behaviour of various agronomic species, their adaptability to the harsh environmental conditions that resemble sand dunes in the Athabasca region of northern Saskatchewan, and the best method of propagating them. The overall objectives of the program were to: reduce soil erosion, minimize dusting, rebuild the organic (top soil) layer, and improve the aesthetics of the site. However, the ultimate goal of any reclamation program is to return the disturbed land to a state similar to pre-development activities, in a self-sustaining condition. In 1993 Cameco-Uranerz augmented its reclamation efforts to include experimental programs designed to enhance the potential for long-term viability of revegetation programs. This process consisted of two parts: (1) the program design, and (2) experimental investigations. Prior to the initiation of the overall program, Cameco-Uranerz retained colder Associates Ltd. to help design a study plan that would evaluate the success of different treatments in different substrates within the Key Lake mine site. The three main areas of investigations included: (1) stabilized hydroseeded areas, (2) sloped unstable areas (i.e. borrow pits and waste rock piles), and (3) exposed areas prone to wind/water erosion. Within each of these areas, various treatments with jack pine seedlings were employed to study their survivability. The primary concerns were moisture retention and wind protection. The experimental plots included: control, peat slurry dip, Alcasorb root dip, wood chip protection, shingle protection, desert tamers, and tire protection. The experimental plots were assessed in the spring and late fall of each year to determine the vigour of the seedlings. Based on the 1994 fall assessment, the survival rates ranged from 73% (shingle protection) to 89% (wood chip) and 71% (tire protection) to 94% (peat slurry dip) for the trees planted in 1993 and 1994 respectively. These recent studies indicated that the best method of reclaiming a disturbed site is to mimic the natural conditions prevalent in the area. To enhance this process the native or imported pioneer species capable of stabilizing a site and paving the way for climax species to survive, must be introduced. The new research also identified the limiting factor affecting the growth of climax species.																			0317-6401		0-88977-102-2				1997	28						89	103																WOS:000079153400010

A total of 86 bird species belonging to 16 orders and 36 families were recorded. Among these, 61.62 % species were residents, 25.58% winter visitors, 8.13% summer breeding visitors and 4.65 % passage migrants. Water birds constituted 33.72% of the avifauna of lake. As many as 162 +/- 17.71 individuals of six species of ducks and 440 +/- 94.51 individuals of other 23 species of water birds were recorded with black coot (Fulica atra) and shoveler (Arms clypeata) as the most abundant species. The densities of water birds and ducks were estimated to be 3.29 and 2.56 birds per hectare, respectively. Presently around 31 % (42 ha) of the lake area has been invaded by Phragmites which provides breeding sites to night heron (Nycticorax nyctocorax) and little egret (Egretta garzetta) having 25 and 13 nests per hectare, respectively. The lake as a whole depicts an alarmingly deplorable ecological condition which is evident from the 39.32 % reduction in the area of lake within a short span of seven years. Unregulated tourism, land encroachment, eutrophication and siltation are major threats to the lake. The lake may lose its resilience in the face of a changing environment due to loss in the species richness and homogenization of species composition with that of bird species of surrounding towns and cultivated lands.					mehmood, tariq/KIK-6696-2024; Rais, Muhammad/JLM-6679-2023														0030-9923					AUG	2011	43	4					673	681																WOS:000288691900007
J	Duguay, CR; Rouse, WR; Lafleur, PM; Boudreau, LD				Duguay, CR; Rouse, WR; Lafleur, PM; Boudreau, LD			Radiation balance of wetland tundra at northern treeline estimated from remotely sensed data	CLIMATE RESEARCH												Traditional methods of measuring surface net radiation involve point measurements that represent only a small area surrounding the instrumented sites. Remotely sensed spaceborne data offer the means by which to obtain estimates of the outgoing fluxes at the regional scale. The objective of this study was to estimate surface albedo, surface thermal exitance, and net radiation using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data over wetland tundra at northern treeline near Churchill, Manitoba, Canada. Ground-based measurements of each component of the radiation balance were acquired at 5 locations coincident with 2 TM overpasses during summer 1991. Each location was representative of 1 of the major terrain types found in the Hudson Bay Lowlands (i.e. sedge-dominated wetland, upland lichen-heath, tundra lakes and ponds, willow/birch wetland, and open spruce-tamarack forest). The mean absolute differences between remote sensing estimates and field measurements (all sites combined) are 0.01 for albedo, 25.7 Wm(-2) for thermal exitance, and 14.1 Wm(-2) for net radiation. The 2 summer 1991 TM images (June and August) were then used to examine within and between terrain type variations in surface net radiation during the growing season. TM imagery from August 1984 and August 1991 were also utilised to investigate differences in surface fluxes between a dry year (1984) and a wet year (1991). Results indicate that surface wetness and, to a lesser extent, phenology are the 2 main factors controlling the radiation balance during the summer period in this subarctic tundra-forest landscape.					; Duguay, Claude/G-5682-2011	Duguay, Claude/0000-0002-1044-5850; 													0936-577X					SEP 7	1999	13	1					77	90		10.3354/cr013077	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/cr013077													WOS:000171723100006

Our chronostratigraphy is based on varve counts verified by conventional and AMS C-14 dating. Individual hemipelagic varve couplets are about 0.8-1.5 mm thick, with light-colored terrigenous laminae (A) deposited mainly during the winter monsoon alternating with dark-colored laminae (B) rich in marine organic matter, coccoliths, and fish debris that reflect deposition during the high-productivity season of the late summer monsoon (August-October). Precipitation and river runoff appear to control varve thickness and turbidite frequency. We infer that precipitation decreased in the river watershed (indicated by thinning varves) after 3500-4000 yr B.P. This is about the time of increasing aridification in the Near East and Middle East, as documented by decreasing Nile River runoff data and lake-level lowstands between Turkey and northwestern India. This precipitation pattern continued until today with precipitation minima about 2200-1900 yr B.P., 1000 yr B.P., and in the late Middle Ages (700-400 yr B.P.), and precipitation maxima in the intervening periods. As documented by spectral analysis, the thickness of varve couplets responds to the average length of a 250-yr cycle, a 125-yr cycle, the Gleissberg cycle of solar activity (95 yr), and a 56-yr cycle of unknown origin, Higher frequency cycles are also present at 45, 39, 29-31, and 14 yr. The sedimentary gray-value also shows strong variability in the 55-yr band plus a 31-yr cycle. Because high-frequency cyclicity in the ENSO band (ca. 3.5 and 5 yr) is only weakly expressed, our data do not support a straightforward interaction of the Pacific ENSO with the monsoon-driven climate system of the Arabian Sea.

J	Kuscu, M; Sener, S; Tuncay, EB				Kuscu, Mustafa; Sener, Sehnaz; Tuncay, Ebru Bapinar			Recharge sources and hydro geochemical evaluations of Na2SO4 deposits in the Augol Lake (Denizli, Turkey)	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												Acigol Lake is the second largest alkaline lake in the world and is in a region that is one of the most important sodium sulphate production fields in Turkey. The present study focuses on determination of sources of the Na2SO4 deposits with main-trace element contents based on hydro-geochemical studies in the lake basin. The geological and hydrogeological properties of the study area were primarily determined. To identify the hydrogeochemical characteristics of spring/groundwater and lake water, chemical analyses results were evaluated with graphical plots such as Piper, Gibbs and Chadha diagrams and the conceptual hydrogeological model was prepared for the area. Mineral paragenesis of the lake sediments mainly consist of gypsum, aragonite, halite, calcite, dolomite, quartz, muscovite, smectite and illite besides tenardite, mirabilite and bloedite minerals. The dominant hydro geochemical fades are Na-SO4, NaCl, Ca-Mg-HCO3 and Ca-Mg-SO4 which are due to water-rock interaction. The mean Na, Ca, SO4, Cl and Mg concentrations in the spring waters are 221.27, 152.62, 374.81, 185.46 and 58.50 ppm respectively; whereas mean concentrations in the lake waters for Na, Ca, SO4, Cl and Mg ions are 22 507, 646, 16 186, 35 691 and 2399 ppm respectively. These major elements have very high concentrations in the lake waters due to the evaporation leading to enrichment. The main mechanism controlling water chemistry in the Acigol Lake basin is the process of water rock interaction. The enrichment of these elements in the springs waters originate from lithological units such as sedimentary, ophiolitic and young magmatic rocks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ma, Q; Zhang, MJ; Wang, LW; Che, YJ				Ma, Qian; Zhang, Mingjun; Wang, Liwei; Che, Yanjun			Quantification of moisture recycling in the river basins of China and its controlling factors	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												By using 243 event-based precipitation samples from April 2011 to March 2012 and 289 long-term monthly average values from the GNIP stations, this study discussed the contribution rate of recycled moisture in The Yangtze River and The Yellow River in China and its controlling factors. The contribution rate of recycled moisture in The Yellow River is higher than the values in The Yangtze River basin during a whole year. The average proportion of recycled moisture, 5.52%, in the Yellow River basin is greater than the value of 1.97% in the Yangtze River basin in summer monsoon and 4.72% higher than 3.67% in winter monsoon. Distinct moisture sources may be a factor to influence the extent of recycled moisture. The Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model was applied to simulate the moisture sources in the study area. The air mass trajectories were controlled by distinct wind regimes during different time. The fraction of recycled moisture increases when the study region is under the control of the westerly air mass. Moreover, the influence of d-excess values should also be taken into consideration. Sub-cloud evaporation exists in the study area and has an impact on the recycled moisture. The evaporation rate in the Yellow River basin is significantly higher than the proportion in the Yangtze River over a year. It can be found that the study region which has a relatively higher evaporation rate always has a higher proportion in recycled moisture.																			1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2019	78	14							392	10.1007/s12665-019-8404-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-019-8404-z													WOS:000475652000011

At the same time, combined with the meteorological observation data, the meteorological factors for affecting water vapor fluxes in the spring were determined. The results showed that water vapor fluxes were positive value among the spring. On a monthly scale, the diurnal changes of water vapor fluxes behaved in a single peak type, the maximum values were all between 12: 00 and 14:00. In each month, water vapor fluxes took on a fluctuant increasing trend, the largest total amount of water vapor fluxes appeared in May, and the minimum appeared in March. Water vapor fluxes were positively correlated with net radiation, air temperature and soil temperature, negatively related with the air relative humidity. In precipitation, there was no significant relationship with water vapor fluxes.																					978-981-4723-00-8; 978-981-4719-99-5				2016																								WOS:000385790000083
J	Beltaos, S				Beltaos, Spyros			Hydrodynamic and climatic drivers of ice breakup in the lower Mackenzie River	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Ice breakup is a controlling factor in the hydrology of arctic deltas, including the Mackenzie River Delta, which is characterized by numerous channels and lakes. Ice jams that may form during the spring breakup often result in flooding, thus replenishing delta lakes with essential water, sediment and nutrients. These processes are primarily driven by the flow of the lower Mackenzie River. The present study, carried out under the auspices of the International Polar Year, examines how the ice cover of the lower Mackenzie River can break up while still retaining a significant portion of its mechanical strength. This is the so-called mechanical breakup, a necessary condition for occurrence of ice jams farther downstream. In most rivers, mechanical breakup can simply result from the rising freshet flow, but this is doubtful for the Lower Mackenzie, owing to the low water surface slope and thick winter ice cover. Analysis of extensive measurements obtained during the 2008 breakup event indicates that mechanical breakup can primarily result from javes, the sharp waves generated upon ice-jam release, which are known to amplify hydrodynamic forces. Further confirmation is provided by archived hydrometric station data for the period 2000-2011. The present results on the conditions of breakup initiation are consistent with past findings while indicating a lower base temperature for the accumulation of "thawing" degree-days. This difference is shown to be linked to water-ice heat exchanges and radiative fluxes. Recommendations for future research include upstream extension of the study reach to include the range of influence of releasing ice jams, and physics-based modeling of the decreasing ice competence during the pre-breakup period.

J	RAHEL, FJ				RAHEL, FJ			FACTORS STRUCTURING FISH ASSEMBLAGES ALONG A BOG LAKE SUCCESSIONAL GRADIENT	ECOLOGY												Three alternate and distinct fish assemblages were identified in 43 northern Wisconsin [USA] lakes encompassing a gradient from bog ponds to small, oligotrophic lakes having little bog character. Multivariate analysis of physical/chemical variables identified 3 general environmental factors that influence community type and species richness. These factors are: habitat size and heterogeneity; lake productivity-pH; and winter O2 concentrations. Ordination of lake fish assemblages along these environmental gradients revealed that 2 factors, lake pH and winter anoxia, were especially crucial in determining assemblage type. Maintenance of these discrete assemblages is also the result of biotic interactions (exclusion of cyprinids due to predation or competition from centrarchids). A centrarchid assemblage dominates lakes across a wide range of habitat types and pH, providing winter anoxia does not occur. Lakes with low winter O2 concentrations harbor a cyprinid assemblage if the pH is > 5.2-5.4. Lakes that are acidic and also have low winter O2 contain only 2 physiologically hardy species comprising the Umbra-Perca assemblage: central mudminnow (Umbra limi) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens). Five fishless lakes had physical and chemical characteristics similar to lakes with an Umbra-Perca assemblage. Within the fish assemblages, no subgroups of closely associated species were evident. For Umbra-Perca lakes, few environmental differences were evident between lakes having no fish, central mudminnows only or, yellow perch and central mudminnows. The sequential loss of species along a gradient from oligotrophic seepage lakes to bog ponds reflected the increased harshness of the chemical environment and the loss of near-shore habitat zones. Species that are specialized zooplanktivores, that utilize hard-bottom substrates for spawning or feeding activites, or that are intolerant of low pH were limited to lakes with little bog character. Lakes in intermediate stages of succession contained acid-tolerant species that are food and habitat generalists. Lakes near the final stages of senescence contained only yellow perch and central mudminnows. The location of bog lakes at the lower end of several environmental gradients makes them valuable sites for studying the influence of environmental factors and biotic interactions on the structure of aquatic communities.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1984	65	4					1276	1289		10.2307/1938333	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1938333													WOS:A1984TC00600023
J	WARNER, BG; HEBDA, RJ; HANN, BJ				WARNER, BG; HEBDA, RJ; HANN, BJ			POSTGLACIAL PALEOECOLOGICAL HISTORY OF A CEDAR SWAMP, MANITOULIN ISLAND, ONTARIO, CANADA	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												A cedar swamp on Manitoulin Island was chosen for a paleoecological study of pollen, macrofossils and Cladocera. A new elevation of 316.7 m is given for the position of Main Lake Algonquin on northeastern Manitoulin Island based on a wave-cut feature 4.7 m above the swamp, immediately adjacent to the site. Deposits inferred to predate 10,500 yr B.P. are dominated by Picea, Artemisia, Cyperaceae and other herbs, likely derived from spruce parkland. Climate on the small proto-Manitoulin Island group was cool and possibly dry. The cladoceran assemblage includes Alona lapidicola, Acroperus harpae and Chydorus brevilabris which resembles the modern fauna of wave-swept rocky shores of Georgian Bay. This suggests that the site was an embayment of Main Lake Algonquin. Local lake waters were cold and shallow. Pinus banksiana/P. resinosa, Populus, Cupressineae, Artemisia, Pteridium and other herbs dominate pollen assemblages from 10,500 to 10,000 yr. B.P. An open, pine-dominated woodland prevailed under a warming and dry climate, and marked progression towards the Holocene climatic optimum on Manitoulin Island. Glacial Lake Algonquin levels fell and the embayment was transformed into a small alkaline lake. Potamogeton filiformis, Hippuris vulgaris and Scirpus plants provided habitat for a diverse littoral and planktonic cladoceran fauna which included C. brevilabris, C. cf. gibbus and Bosmina longirostris. Waters in the swamp basin were rich in nutrients, warm and possibly transparent. From 10,000-8000 yr B.P., Picea returned as the dominant pollen type and was slightly more abundant than P. banksiana/P. resinosa. Toward the end of this period, Abies, Larix and Betula increased in frequency. Picea forest with P. banksiana/P. resinosa grew on shallow, well-drained soils. Climate became more continental, winters more severe and summers drier and hotter, as the moderating effects of the Great Lakes ceased during the Lake Stanley-Lake Hough stage. At the site, a shallow pond with abundant submersed and emergent aquatic plants and a diverse littoral cladoceran community existed. At 8000 yr B.P., Pinus strobus replaced Picea and P. banksiana/P. resinosa. Shortly after, Tsuga canadensis and Larix become important. This conifer-dominated pollen assemblage persists to the present and reflects modern forests. The presence of Nyssa pollen and Decodon verticillatus seeds, contemporaneous with their range extensions elsewhere in the Great Lakes Region, implies that the Hypsithermal maximum occurred .apprx. 6000 yr B.P. on Manitoulin Islands when climate remained warmer than present but became humid after .apprx. 8000 yr B.P. By 5000 yr B.P. conditions became cooler. Prairie and Cordilleran floristic elements in the modern Manitoulin flora are probably remnants, predating 10,000 yr, B.P. The southern floristic element may represent late Hypsithermal relicts. Fluctuating water levels and influence of mineral-rich groundwater probably were key factors controlling hydroseral succession in cedar swamps on Manitoulin Island.																			0031-0182	1872-616X					1984	45	3-4					301	+		10.1016/0031-0182(84)90010-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(84)90010-5													WOS:A1984SV82100003

An inexpensive method for the measurement of photosynthetically active radiation profiles in waterbodies	AQUATIC SCIENCES												We developed an inexpensive light instrument (ILI) and protocol for the measurement of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) at discrete depths underwater. We tested the accuracy of the ILI against a submersible radiometer (RAD) and a Secchi disk method. The ILI consists of a PAR sensor (HOBO MX2202; Onset) attached to a flat disk that ensures that the sensor faces upwards when lowered through the water column. The flat disk is attached to a rope marked at 1-m increments (to 20 m) that allows for the measurement of PAR at discrete depths. A weight is attached to the bottom of the flat disk to prevent it from drifting. The ILI is much cheaper (US $130), less bulky, and lighter (1.1 kg) than the RAD (US $40,000, weight 9 kg). We tested our method in a mesotrophic lake and in an oligotrophic lake in summer and fall 2023. The correlations between the RAD and ILI measurements of irradiance at depth (as a percentage of surface irradiance), and the depth to which 1% of the PAR at the surface penetrated the water (Z1%PAR), were high and did not significantly differ. There was a difference of 8% in the Z1%PAR determined by the ILI compared with that determined by the RAD. However, the estimated Z1%PAR based on the Secchi disk data was 37% deeper than that calculated with the RAD data. Our method should enable the study of underwater PAR in remote regions where transporting bulky and expensive equipment is impossible due to logistic and/or financial constraints. Moreover, our method can be used for the direct measurement of PAR at discrete depths.

Diatom-inferred epilimnetic summer water temperatures show a close correspondence with temperature reconstructions from the adjacent Lake Langsee record and, on a hemispheric scale, with fluctuations of ice-rafted debris in the North Atlantic. This suggests that North Atlantic climate triggered summer climate variability in the Alps during the early late glacial. The expansion of pine (mainly dwarf pine) between ca. 18.5 and 18.1k cal a BP indicates warming during the so-called Langsee oscillation. The subsequent stepwise climate deterioration between ca. 18.1 and 17.6k cal a BP culminated in a tripartite cold period between ca. 17.6 and 16.9k cal a BP with diatom-inferred summer water temperatures 8.510?degrees C below modern values and a shift from wet to dry conditions. This period probably coincides with a major Alpine glacier advance termed the Gschnitz stadial. A warmer interval between ca. 16.9 and 16.4k cal a BP separates this cold phase from a second, shorter and less pronounced cold phase between ca. 16.4 and 16.0k cal a BP, which is thought to correlate with the Clavadel/Senders glacier advance in the Alps. The following temperature increase, coupled with wet (probably snow-rich) conditions, caused the expansion of birch during the transition period to the late glacial interstadial.

J	Orendt, C				Orendt, C			A classification of semi-natural northern prealpine river stretches based on chironomid communities	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Using cluster analysis, ecological profiles of the species, and the (Diamesinae + Orthocladiinae)/Chironominae ratios, preal-pine rivers were classified by their chironomid communities based on 338 species: (1) summer-cold mountain rivers (Isar, Salzach, Inn/Miffildorf), (2) summer-warm moraine-stretches (Wurm, Alz/moraine rupture, Amper, Altmuhl), (3) the summer-warm lowland river Upper Alz (lake outlet and the stretch to Altenmarkt village), (4) the lower section of the river Inn regulated by dams, which is dominated by a littoral community. The river Upper Alz is faunistically differentiated along it's course. Classification of river stretches is predominantly explained by rhithral and eurytope species. Potamal and littoral species had no effect on classification. The results suggest that water temperature is the most important factor of the chironomid-based river classification, which is in harmony with studies by Rossaro (1992) and Lindegaard & Brodersen (1995). Locally, other morphological parameters as reach slope and substrate may be important factors as well. However, further data are needed to clarify their role in species distribution.																			0003-4088						2003	39	3					219	237		10.1051/limn/2003018	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2003018													WOS:000185710900004
J	Diehl, S; Berger, SA; Soissons, Q; Giling, DP; Stibor, H				Diehl, Sebastian; Berger, Stella A.; Soissons, Quentin; Giling, Darren P.; Stibor, Herwig			An experimental demonstration of the critical depth principle	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Sverdrup's critical depth hypothesis, which has had an almost canonical status in biological oceanography, has recently been challenged as a universal explanation for the formation of oceanic spring blooms, and several alternative hypotheses have been proposed. Arguments pro and contra alternative explanations have so far relied on theoretical considerations and purely observational data. In this paper, we propose that mesocosm experiments with natural plankton communities could make important contributions to the resolution of the issue. We first briefly review the foundations of the critical depth concept and derive an approximate relationship that relates optically scaled critical depth (="critical optical depth", i.e. the product of the light attenuation coefficient and the critical depth) to light-dependent phytoplankton production in the mixed surface layer. We describe how this relationship can be used to scale experimental mesocosms such that they reproduce ambient light conditions of natural water columns from the surface down to the critical depth and beyond. We illustrate the power of the approach with a mesocosm study in which we experimentally controlled the onset of the spring bloom of a lake plankton community through the manipulation of optically scaled mixed-layer depth. This experiment may be the first experimental demonstration of the critical depth principle acting on a natural plankton community. Compensation light intensity (=minimum average mixed-layer light intensity required to trigger a bloom of the ambient plankton community) could be constrained to be somewhat above 3.2 moles PAR m(-2) d(-1), corresponding to a critical optical depth of 10.5. We compare these numbers to estimates from marine systems and end with a discussion of how experiments could be designed to (i) more accurately determine the critical depth in a given system and (ii) resolve among competing hypotheses for vernal bloom onset.					; Diehl, Sebastian/AAG-8952-2019	Giling, Darren P./0000-0002-9843-4362; 													1054-3139	1095-9289				JUL-AUG	2015	72	6					2051	2060		10.1093/icesjms/fsv032	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsv032													WOS:000359696500030

Yet, the knowledge on MSR magnitudes is limited and mostly restricted to snap-shot conditions in specific surface water bodies. Potential impacts of MSR have consequently been unaccounted for, e.g., in regional or global weathering budgets. Here, we synthesize results from previous studies on sulfur isotope dynamics in stream water samples and apply a sulfur isotopic fractionation and mixing scheme combined with Monte Carlo simulations to derive MSR in entire hydrological catchments. This allowed comparison of magnitudes both within and between five study areas located between southern Sweden and the Kola Peninsula, Russia. Our results showed that the freshwater MSR ranged from 0 to 79 % (interquartile range of 19 percentage units) locally within the catchments, with average values from 2 to 28 % between the catchments, displaying a non-negligible catchment-average value of 13 %. The combined abundance or deficiency of several landscape elements (e.g., the areal percentage of forest and lakes/wetlands) were found to indicate relatively well whether or not catchmentscale MSR would be high. A regression analysis showed specifically that average slope was the individual element that best reflected the MSR magnitude, both at sub-catchment scale and between the different study areas. However, the regression results of individual parameters were generally weak. The MSR-values additionally showed differences between seasons, in particular in wetland/lake dominated catchments. Here MSR was high during the spring flood, which is consistent with the mobilization of water that under low-flow winter periods have developed the needed anoxic conditions for sulfate-reducing microorganisms. This study presents for the first time compelling evidence from multiple catchments of wide-spread MSR at levels slightly above 10 %, implying that the terrestrial pyrite oxidation may be underestimated in global weathering budgets.

J	Sachse, D; Radke, J; Gleixner, G				Sachse, D; Radke, J; Gleixner, G			δD values of individual n-alkanes from terrestrial plants along a climatic gradient - Implications for the sedimentary biomarker record	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The compound-specific hydrogen isotope composition (delta D) of sedimentary n-alkanes is increasingly used as a palaeo-climate proxy. To explore the origin of the hydrogen isotope signal of n-alkanes from higher terrestrial plant biomass in sedimentary organic matter of small lakes we have analysed the n-alkane composition and delta D values of 31 plant biomass samples (Birch (Betula), Beech (Fagus), Oak (Quercus), Alder (Alnus), Hombeam (Carpinus) and Myrtle (Myrtus) as well as non-stomata containing Sphagnum, Cladonia and moss) from 14 sites along a climatic gradient from Northern Finland to Southern Italy. Eleven of the sites were previously investigated for the n-alkane delta D values in adjacent lake sediments and are compared to the leaf wax n-alkane delta D values. The distribution of terrestrial n-alkanes in lake sediments was not found to be characteristic of the dominant vegetation around the lake. Evidently, n-alkane distributions within the same species at different sites were found to be variable. These findings complicate the use of certain n-alkane distributions in sediments as a palaeoenvironmental indicator. delta D values of plant biomass n-alkanes show a significant positive correlation with the precipitation delta D values. Biomass n-alkane delta D values are in general less negative than the associated sedimentary n-alkanes of terrestrial origin, possibly due to the stronger evapotranspiration during the summer, when sampling took place. This suggests, that n-alkanes in leaves show seasonal variations and the sedimentary organic matter receives the lighter isotope signal of the autumn, when most leaves are incorporated into the sediment. The variability of the delta D values from non-stomata containing plants is much higher than for broadleaf trees, since stomata can regulate water loss through evapotranspiration. The average chain length (ACL) of n-alkanes from deciduous tree leaves increases from North to South. With increasing ACL the hydrogen isotopic fractionation (epsilon) between source water and n-alkanes also increases. Our results prove that terrestrial n-alkane delta D values record the delta D value of precipitation, modified by the amount of isotope enrichment in the leaf water due to plant anatomy (stomata vs. no stomata) and site specific meteorological conditions, such as evapotranspiration, relative humidity and soil moisture. Therefore, terrestrial n-alkanes in lake sediments can deliver information on changes in these parameters over geological timescales. In lake sediments where aquatic n-alkanes, such as n-C-17 record the lake water delta D value, the isotopic difference between terrestrial and aquatic n-alkanes could therefore be used to reconstruct changes in evapotranspiration.

The flux significance for the arid vicinity around the Dead Sea is decisive not only for a sustainable management in terms of water availability for future generations but also for the resilience of the unique ecosystems along its coast. Coping with different challenges interdisciplinary methods like (i) hydrogeochemical fingerprinting, (ii) satellite and airborne-based thermal remote sensing, (iii) direct measurement with gauging station in ephemeral wadis and a first multilateral gauging station at the river Jordan, (iv) hydro-bio-geochemical approach at submarine and shore springs along the Dead Sea and (v) hydro(geo)logical modelling contributed to the overall aim. As primary results, we deduce that the following: (i) Within the drainage basins of the Dead Sea, the total mean annual precipitation amounts to 300 mm a(-1) west and to 179 mm a(-1) east of the lake, respectively. (ii) The total mean annual runoff volumes from side wadis (except the Jordan River) entering the Dead Sea is approximately 58-66 x 10(6) m(3) a(-1) (western wadis: 7-15 x 10(6) m(3) a(-1); eastern wadis: 51 x 10(6) m(3) a(-1)). (iii) The modelled groundwater discharge from the upper Cretaceous aquifers in both flanks of the Dead Sea towards the lake amounts to 177 x 106 m(3) a(-1). (iv) An unexpected abundance of life in submarine springs exists, which in turn explains microbial moderated geo-bio-chemical processes in the Dead Sea sediments, affecting the highly variable chemical composition of on- and offshore spring waters. The results of this work show a promising enhancement of describing and modelling the Dead Sea basin as a whole. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A wide window of migration phenology captures inter-annual variability of favourable conditions: Results of a whole-lake experiment with juvenile Pacific salmon	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Survival of post-larval and juvenile organisms can depend on multiple seasonally-fluctuating features, including thermal conditions and food availability. Alterations in the phenology of either consumers or their prey might decouple trophic relationships and reduce consumer growth and survival, and this potential for mismatches is especially pronounced in migratory organisms that change habitats. Juvenile sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) migrate from natal streams to lake habitats, and we hypothesised that their in-lake growth and survival depends on whether timing of migration matches suitable lake conditions. We used mixed effects models to test the hypotheses that: (a) the most successful entry times correspond to favourable prey densities and lake thermal conditions; and (b) a mismatch in fish entry time and seasonal lake dynamics can reduce fish growth and survival. These models were applied to an 11-year time series of migration timing, capture rate and size at smolting for juvenile sockeye salmon in Lake Washington, WA, USA. Juvenile sockeye salmon entering Lake Washington later in the season encountered higher zooplankton abundance and warmer water, and experienced higher average rates of growth and survival, but the optimal date for lake entry ranged across years by up to a month. Zooplankton abundance and bloom timing affected fish growth and relative survival more than lake temperature, and survival was most influenced by zooplankton abundance in the spring when fish entered the lake. In contrast, fish size at seaward migration from the lake depended primarily on zooplankton abundance in the spring as they left the lake rather than the previous spring when they entered. These results suggest that maintaining a wide window of lake entry dates allows this population to capture the annually-varying period of favourable conditions, minimising mismatches between juvenile fish and their resources and thereby enabling successful recruitment in an unpredictable environment.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				JAN	2019	64	1					46	55		10.1111/fwb.13193	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13193													WOS:000453853500004

The historical experiment simulations of 19 models that participated in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) are evaluated, and the future variation tendency under four emission scenarios is projected. The results indicate that the water vapor content and the net water vapor budget over the TP show notable increasing trends, which are mainly manifested by a significant increase in the net water vapor import and a significant decrease in the water vapor export on the eastern boundary of the TP. This is mainly due to an anomalous anticyclone from Lake Baikal to the Mongolian Plateau. The CMIP6 multi-model ensemble can well simulate the variation characteristics of the TP net water vapor budget. The projection results indicate that by the end of the twenty-first century, the water vapor content, the net water vapor import and precipitation over the TP will increase. Under a high-emissions scenario and compared with the current period (1991-2014), these three variables will increase by 47.99%, 59.77% and 18.59% in the long term (2081-2100), respectively. The significant enhancement of meridional water vapor transport over the northern TP may be the main reason for the increase in humidity over the TP.

The gas vesicles were strong enough to withstand the depth of winter mixing, down to the permanent halocline (60 m in the Bomholm Sea, 90m in the Eastern Gotland Sea) or to the sea bottom (30m or less in the shallow Arkona Sea and Mecklenburg Eight). The cyanobacteria had low cell turgor pressures, within the range 0.08-0.18 MPa. The colonies were highly buoyant: the Aphanizomenon colonies floated up at a mean velocity of 22 m per day and the Nodularia colonies at 36m per day. The colonies remained floating when up to half of the gas vesicles had been collapsed. In summer the cyanobacteria were mostly restricted to the water above the thermocline and in calm conditions their concentration increased towards the top of the water column. A series of colony concentration profiles indicated that, following a deep mixing event, the population of colonies moved upward with a net velocity of 22 m per day, similar to the colony floating velocity. This demonstrated that the buoyancy provided by gas vesicles would give a selective advantage to populations of cyanobacteria by enabling them to float into the higher irradiance of the near-surface water.																			0967-0262	1469-4433				MAY	1995	30	2					87	94		10.1080/09670269500650851	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09670269500650851													WOS:A1995RA57200002

Identifying chemolithotrophic and pathogenic-related gene expression within suspended sediment flocs in freshwater environments: A metatranscriptomic assessment	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The introduction and proliferation of pathogenic organisms in aquatic systems is a serious global issue that consequently leads to economic, financial, and health concerns. Health and safety related to recreational water use is typically monitored through water quality assessments that are outdated and can be misleading. These traditional methods focus on broad taxa groups, provide no insight into the active community or source of contamination, and the sediment compartments (bed and suspended) are often overlooked. To bridge this knowledge gap, our study aimed to 1) examine the metatranscriptome of the microbial community associated with suspended sediment (SS) in freshwater systems; 2) explore the influence of SS in tributaries to the littoral zone of the receiving lake; and 3) compare the SS fraction with previously reported nearshore bed sediment data. Samples were collected seasonally from Lake St. Clair and Lake Erie. Beaches in this region are influenced by both agriculture runoff and continued urban expansion. Results show that both adjacent tributary and beach SS have similar microbial functional diversity and are strongly correlated by site and season. We identified expression of transcripts encoding sequences with similarities to genes involved in nine bacterial infectious disease pathways, including legionellosis (sdhA) and Vibrio cholerae pathogenesis. According to MG-RAST gene categories, lake samples typically showed higher overall expression (p < 0.05) of transcripts with similarities to genes involved in infectious disease pathways compared to the tributaries, with summer upregulated (p < 0.05) compared to fall. Our data suggests SS acts as a strong vector for pathogen transport, making this facet an important area for further research as it pertains to human health regarding recreational water use. To our knowledge, this work is the first to investigate SS in aquatic microbial communities using metatranscriptomic analyses and has significant potential to help address growing issues of microbial contamination impacting freshwater security.

In this study, to determine the sources and composition of the organic matter in the Hulun Lake basin during the spring-thaw period, a total of twenty-three sampling sites were investigated. Results showed high levels of organic matter pollution in the surface water of Hulun Lake, with an average COD values of 119.35 mg L-1. Organic matter came from natural sources as well as a variety of anthropogenic activities. The direct sources included urbanization, industrial and residential wastewater discharge, and emission from burning fossile fuels. A large indirect source was organic matter from tumbleweed decomposition, which had increased due to desertification caused by overgrazing. The principal component analysis showed that organic matter from Hulun lake shared composition and sources with the upstream sections of the natural tributaries and the downstream section of the artificial tributary. The artificial inflow river contributed more organic matter than the other tributaries. Notably, a large portion of organic matter in Hulun Lake came from decomposing tumbleweed concentrated in the downstream section of one of the natural rivers. New indirect consequences of human activities must be factored into the rule and regulations that protect plateau lake ecosystems alongside the direct effects of established human activities.

J	Lindeman, PV				Lindeman, Peter, V			A Few Moments with Turtles: The Value of Freshwater Chelonians as Watchable Urban Wildlife Spectacles	CHELONIAN CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY												The high valuation of urban green spaces is obvious, given the lost economic opportunities their preservation requires. With more and more of the world's human population moving to urban areas, experiences with urban wildlife are becoming increasingly important for maintenance of people's connection to and concern for the natural world. Turtle watching provides an opportunity to connect urban residents with charismatic species that engender positive aesthetic responses from the public. In Erie, Pennsylvania, the Presque Isle Partnership is a nonprofit organization dedicated to enhancing visitor experiences at Presque Isle State Park. The park is a sandspit peninsula on Lake Erie that has abundant turtle populations in its sheltered bays and interior wetlands, particularly its populations of the common map turtle, Graptemys geographica. The common map turtles of Graveyard Pond have long been one of the park's signature wildlife spectacles. A basking aggregation that can exceed 100 turtles in late spring and early fall is enjoyed by visitors to a shoreline picnic area, canoeists, kayakers, and guests on the park's pontoon boat tours. In 2012, the Partnership funded construction of a handicapped-accessible turtle observation deck with fixed binocular viewfinders and informative signage. Total material cost for the project was $20,466 (similar to$22,922 in 2020 US dollars); labor for construction was donated by local industry. Since its construction, the observation deck has become a popular stop for park visitors. Similar projects would be suitable for many urban areas in the United States and many other countries with watchable turtle populations and would enhance urban residents' encounters with urban turtle populations.																			1071-8443	1943-3956				DEC	2020	19	2					291	297		10.2744/CCB-1421.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2744/CCB-1421.1													WOS:000606541400015

A more than 130-year-time-series of ice-on and ice-off, and freeze-up and break-up dates was analysed from 4 selected hydrological stations along the lower course of the River Drava since the beginning of river ice observations the start- and end-dates of ice phenomena on Drava River have displayed a significant trend. Freeze-up dates have shifted to similar to 9 days later, and break-up dates to similar to 10 days earlier. A similar trend is present in the dates of ice-on and ice-off; these dates have shifted to similar to 23 days later and similar to 17 days earlier per 100 years on average. These changes have resulted in a pronounced reduction in the ice-covered and ice-affected seasons, too. The duration of ice-cover has decreased by similar to 14 days and the total number of ice-affected days has decreased by similar to 31 days over a century on average on the lower course of the Drava. Interannual variability was compared to local and regional instrumental temperature records. The strongest correlation was found between ice-off and January-February mean temperatures (r= 0.81, p <0.05), and between the total number of icy days and the mean winter temperature (r= 0.88, p <0.05). Statistical evidence indicated, however, that the subdued climate control from the 1970s is probably due to anthropogenic intervention in the upper course (e.g. reservoir construction, hydropower management). Spatial correlation analysis revealed that the temperature signal carried by the river ice records of the Drava prior to the anthropogenic disturbance seems to be a powerful proxy for the winter temperature of Central Europe.

Using a synoptic climatological classification scheme, it is found that durign the winter this region is dominated by stagnant conditions associated with slow-moving high pressure systems. Using topographic analyses, the Lake Powell area across S Utah and N Arizona can be regarded as a trapping basin which enhances pollution accumulation significantly under stagnant conditions. By applying a mesoscale meteorological model and a Lagrangian particle dispersion model, the dispersion characteristics of pollution from local sources are simulated for this situation. The results demonstrate the trapping and recirculation characteristics of the Lake Powell area for the commonly observed southwesterly synoptic flow just to the west of a surface polar high pressure system. Under such conditions during the winter, accumulation of pollution from local sources is expected to degrade the air quality in this region.

J	Livingstone, DM; Adrian, R				Livingstone, David M.; Adrian, Rita			Modeling the duration of intermittent ice cover on a lake for climate-change studies	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A generalized empirical approach to the problem of the prediction of intermittent lake ice cover for climate-change studies is presented and applied to historical ice data from Muggelsee, a shallow lake in northern Germany that experiences either no ice cover, intermittent ice cover, or continuous ice cover, depending on the severity of the winter. The approach presented allows the total duration of ice cover in any winter to be estimated in terms of an air-temperature probability function. Advantages over traditional empirical methods based on the mean air temperature during a fixed period or on the computed number of negative degree-days are: (1) it is valid for both continuous and intermittent ice cover; (2) it is not necessary to specify a fixed time period for integration in advance; (3) the results emerge in time units, allowing them to be directly compared with the measured duration of ice cover without prior calibration; and (4) it is based on statistical properties of the ambient air temperature that are routinely forecast by climate models, making it easy to apply predictively. Regional climate model forecasts for northern Germany imply that for Muggelsee, the percentage of ice-free winters will increase from similar to 2% to over 60% by the end of the current century.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	2009	54	5					1709	1722		10.4319/lo.2009.54.5.1709	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2009.54.5.1709													WOS:000268325300027
J	Moreno-Ostos, E; da Silva, SLR; de Vicente, I; Cruz-Pizarro, L				Moreno-Ostos, Enrique; Rodrigues da Silva, Sergio L.; de Vicente, Inmaculada; Cruz-Pizarro, Luis			Interannual and between-site variability in the occurrence of clear water phases in two shallow Mediterranean lakes	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												It is widely accepted that clear water phases constitute a regular stage in the seasonal succession of plankton in dimictic lakes and reservoirs (i.e. PEG Model). The occurrence of such a phenomenon in Mediterranean shallow lakes is characterised by a marked interannual variability, which makes it difficult to establish reliable predictions on the dynamics and functioning of plankton in these ecosystems. In the present paper we analyse the factors influencing the occurrence of the clear water phases in the two shallow lakes of the Albufera of Adra, a coastal wetland region of south-eastern Spain: Lake Honda and Lake Nueva. Despite their geographical proximity, both lakes depicted large hydrological and limnological differences. Lake Honda is an epigenic and recharge lake that is strongly influenced by the hydrological conditions in its watershed, while Lake Nueva can be classified as a hypogenic and discharge lake and, as such, is less affected by the hydrological regime. In contrast, the morphometry, exposure and fetch of Lake Nueva make this ecosystem especially sensitive to wind forcing. Clear water phases in these shallow lakes were linked with periods of low thermal stability and the dominance of small-edible algae in the phytoplankton community, both of which allowed a Daphnia magna population to grow up and induce the algae collapse by grazing. In Lake Honda, those conditions were met during the spring of 2002 under the influence of intense rainfall-events, while in Lake Nueva the clear water phase was induced in the spring of 2003 by the occurrence of strong and frequent wind events. In both lakes, a relatively high water column thermal stability and the abundance of cyanobacteria early in the spring prevented the development of the Daphnia magna population and the occurrence of the clear water phase.					de Vicente, Inmaculada/S-2067-2016; Cruz-Pizarro, Luis/H-5318-2015; De Vicente Alvarez Manzaneda, Inmaculada/S-2067-2016; Ferreira-Silva, Sergio Luiz/Q-4775-2017; Moreno-Ostos, Enrique/R-6782-2019	Cruz-Pizarro, Luis/0000-0003-0687-0704; De Vicente Alvarez Manzaneda, Inmaculada/0000-0002-1449-5740; Moreno Ostos, Enrique/0000-0001-9471-3922; 													1386-2588	1573-5125				JUN	2007	41	2					285	297		10.1007/s10452-006-9072-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-006-9072-0													WOS:000248109100014

SG14 Project Members	A detailed record of large explosive eruptions from Japan between 120 and 50 ka preserved at Lake Suigetsu	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We present the findings of a detailed non-visible (cryptotephra) tephra investigation of the Lake Suigetsu (Japan) sedimentary sequence spanning 120 to 50 ka. Thirty-nine new cryptotephra and two visible tephra horizons are identified during this interval interspersed between visible tephra layers associated with large-magnitude eruptions and regional event markers (e.g., Aso-4, K-Tz, Ata). The newly identified volcanic deposits are geochemically analysed using major (EMP) and trace (LA-ICP-MS) element glass analyses, and the chemical fingerprints are used to trace these deposits to subduction related volcanoes located along the three main Japanese islands (Kyushu, Honshu and Hokkaido), as well as nearby intraplate volcanoes. Our findings provide geochemical, chronological and ash-fall constraints on the activity at multiple volcanic centres; in particular, the Kirishima volcanic complex in the southern volcanic region of Kyushu. Furthermore, the Lake Suigetsu cryptotephra record reveals distal ash-fall from two notable large magnitude (>= M6.0) eruptions, the Plinian Sambe Kisuki (SK) eruption and the caldera-forming Toya eruption, both of which are important widespread tephrostratigraphic markers suitable for linking regional terrestrial and marine sequences. Using the Lake Suigetsu agedepth model, they are dated to 100.4 +/- 3.1 ka (+/- 1 sigma) and 108.1 +/- 3.9 ka (+1 sigma), respectively. Finally, our investigation reveals numerous eruption deposits which have not yet been identified in near-vent sequences, indicating eruption under-recording. This research re-affirms Lake Suigetsu as the single most comprehensive ash-fall record of East Asian explosive volcanism over the past 150 kyr, and contributes significantly to our understanding of the timing and ash dispersals of pre-historic eruptions.

J	Reichart, I; Simon, M				Reichart, I; Simon, M			Horizontal variability of bacterioplankton growth dynamics in a large lake	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												We examined the horizontal variability of bacterioplankon growth dynamics in the western part of Lake Constance, Germany, including its northwestern fjord-like arm, Lake Uberlingen. From May until September 1993, we measured depth profiles of bacterioplankton abundance and production as well as temperature and chlorophyll at 7 stations on the same day or on 2 consecutive days. In addition, we examined the horizontal distribution of bacterioplankton growth with a higher areal resolution in Lake Uberlingen in August 1993 and May 1994 by collecting samples from the upper 20 m at 10 stations on 4 occasions. In August 1994 we also measured these growth dynamics in 1 km(2) in the center of Lake Uberlingen by sampling 9 stations. The results show that the variability of bacterioplankton production was more pronounced than that of abundance and that the variability was always greatest in the upper 10 m. Total horizontal variability of bacterioplankton production ranged from <2- to 8-fold but in most cases remained <3-fold. Greatest variabilities always occurred at the transitions between different seasonal phases such as the phytoplankton spring bloom and clear-water phase or clear-water phase and phytoplankton summer bloom. On the basis of the coefficient of variation of the horizontal mean of production rates (standard error/mean) variability in the total study area and in Lake Uberlingen was greater than that in 1 km(2) in the center of Lake Uberlingen, which was still greater than the within-sample variation. The seasonal dynamics of bacterioplankton growth were fairly similar at all 7 stations and 3- to 6-fold higher than the horizontal variability. We did not find any systematic horizontal patterns of bacterioplankton growth dynamics and there were no clear correlations to horizontal patterns of chlorophyll or temperature.																			0948-3055					AUG 29	1996	11	1					31	41		10.3354/ame011031	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame011031													WOS:A1996VF81000004
J	JONES, RI; ILMAVIRTA, V				JONES, RI; ILMAVIRTA, V			VERTICAL AND SEASONAL-VARIATION OF PHYTOPLANKTON PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN A BROWN-WATER LAKE WITH WINTER ICE COVER	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Unlike previously studied lakes with prolonged winter ice and snow cover, Lake Paajarvi, southern Finland, has a high humus content and consequently differs in both the quantity and quality of light penetration into its waters. The range of temperature fluctuation and the degree of development of thermal stratification are greater in Paajarvi, and this increased environmental heterogeneity apparently stimulates diversity in the phytoplankton community, especially in the seasonal succession of species. Differences in the photosynthetic capacity of algae from different depths in the H2O column were not great. This is attributed to the extremely shallow euphotic zone, algae circulating freely through the steep light gradient and sedimenting rapidly once they pass through the thermocline into the hypolimnion. Adaptation of phytoplankton to the great seasonal changes in irradiance is apparently achieved largely by successive growths of different species in the community, and the adaptations and vertical migrations by individual algal spp., which were reported from polar and high alpine lakes, may be of secondary importance in Paajarvi. The species successions in Paajarvi produce changes in the pigment content of algae similar to those reported from polar and high alpine lakes, confirming that change in pigmentation is an important mechanism in light adaptation, whether at community or individual level. Algal pigment content was particularly high at the end of the long period of winter ice cover, indicating a degree of adaptation to the prolonged low-light conditions, which produced the extremely high photosynthetic capacities measured at this time. Phytoplankton production at any irradiance was primarily determined by biomass.

Based on the multiproxy approach, including organic geochemistry (carbon isotopes), magnetic susceptibility as primary proxies and inorganic geochemistry (major oxides) with grain size analysis as secondary proxies, climate of the mid-late Holocene (-4600 yr) has been established on centennial to millennial scale. The chronology of the sediments is constrained by five AMS radiocarbon dates. The sedimentological data reveal variations in sediment grain size related to palaeoprecipitation. The first high resolution multi-proxy record from the Khajjiar lake core indicates less humid conditions during-4600-4185 cal yr BP except an extreme peak of dry and arid climate at around-4370 cal yr BP. Intensified monsoon with more wet and humid conditions has been interpreted during-4185-3790 cal yr BP.-3790-3300 cal yr BP,-2845-2115 and-1555-405 cal yr BP, and-2990-2845 cal yr BP and fluctuations are observed from-2115 to 1555 cal yr BP. The results suggest two major climatic phases corresponding with the 4.2 ka and Roman Warm Period (RWP). A regional comparison of mid-late Holocene climate records reveals a broad synchronicity, but with considerable spatial variation. The timing and duration of climate events varied across regions.

Fernandez			Response of ice cover on shallow lakes of the North Slope of Alaska to contemporary climate conditions (1950-2011): radar remote-sensing and numerical modeling data analysis	CRYOSPHERE												Air temperature and winter precipitation changes over the last five decades have impacted the timing, duration, and thickness of the ice cover on Arctic lakes as shown by recent studies. In the case of shallow tundra lakes, many of which are less than 3m deep, warmer climate conditions could result in thinner ice covers and consequently, in a smaller fraction of lakes freezing to their bed in winter. However, these changes have not yet been comprehensively documented. The analysis of a 20 yr time series of European remote sensing satellite ERS-1/2 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and a numerical lake ice model were employed to determine the response of ice cover (thickness, freezing to the bed, and phenology) on shallow lakes of the North Slope of Alaska (NSA) to climate conditions over the last six decades. Given the large area covered by these lakes, changes in the regional climate and weather are related to regime shifts in the ice cover of the lakes. Analysis of available SAR data from 1991 to 2011, from a sub-region of the NSA near Barrow, shows a reduction in the fraction of lakes that freeze to the bed in late winter. This finding is in good agreement with the decrease in ice thickness simulated with the Canadian Lake Ice Model (CLIMo), a lower fraction of lakes frozen to the bed corresponding to a thinner ice cover. Observed changes of the ice cover show a trend toward increasing floating ice fractions from 1991 to 2011, with the greatest change occurring in April, when the grounded ice fraction declined by 22% (alpha = 0.01). Model results indicate a trend toward thinner ice covers by 18-22 cm (no-snow and 53% snow depth scenarios, alpha = 0.01) during the 1991-2011 period and by 21-38 cm (alpha = 0.001) from 1950 to 2011. The longer trend analysis (1950-2011) also shows a decrease in the ice cover duration by similar to 24 days consequent to later freeze-up dates by 5.9 days (alpha = 0.1) and earlier break-up dates by 17.7-18.6 days (alpha = 0.001).

Spatio-temporal niche partitioning of closely related picocyanobacteria clades and phycocyanin pigment types in Lake Constance (Germany)	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												We found that the clade-specific abundance dynamics of Synechococcus type picocyanobacteria in the pelagic and littoral zone macro-habitats of Lake Constance (Germany) challenge the hypothesis of a regular annual succession of picocyanobacteria genotypes in temperate zone lakes. Methods used in this study were quantitative Taq nuclease assays (TNA), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), a 19-month time series analysis (with two isothermal and two stratified periods) and genotyping of a new littoral phycocyanin (PC)-rich Synechococcus strain collection. The recorded differences between the two macro-habitats and between seasons or years, and the observed effect of water column mixis in winter on the inversion of clade-specific dominance ratios in Lake Constance might explain the known inter-annual differences in abundance and dynamics of the autotrophic picoplankton (APP) in lakes. The APP in Lake Constance shows a high genetic diversity with a low overall abundance, similar to the APP in the Baltic Sea, but different from Lake Biwa in Japan or lakes in the UK. Our results indicate that APP bloom events in both macro-habitats of Lake Constance are driven by phycoerythrin-rich Synechococcus genotypes of the Subalpine Cluster I. DGGE revealed the presence of a diverse periphyton (biofilm) community of the PC-rich Synechococcus pigment type in the littoral zone in early spring, when no such community was detectable in the pelagic habitat. A more sensitive and quantitative approach with TNA, however, revealed an intermittent presence of one PC-rich genotype in the plankton. We discuss the seasonal development of the pelagic and littoral PC-rich community, and while we cannot rule out a strain isolation bias, we found that isolated PC-rich strains from the pelagic habitat have different genotypes when compared to new littoral strains. We also observed littoral substrates colonized by specific PC-rich Synechococcus genotypes.

A main category of microplastics is synthetic microfibers, which originate from textiles. These microplastics are generated and released in laundering and are discharged by wastewater treatment plants or enter surface waters from other sources. The polymers that constitute many common synthetic microfibers are mostly denser than water, and eventually settle out in aquatic environments. The interaction of these microfibers with submerged aquatic vegetation has not been thoroughly investigated but is potentially an important aquatic sink in surface waters. In the Laurentian Great Lakes, prolific growth of macrophytic Cladophora creates submerged biomass with a large amount of surface area and the potential to collect and concentrate microplastics. To determine the number of synthetic microfibers in Great Lakes Cladophora, samples were collected from Lakes Erie and Michigan at multiple depths in the spring and summer of 2018. After rinsing and processing the algae, associated synthetic microfibers were quantified. The average loads of synthetic microfibers determined from the Lake Erie and Lake Michigan samples were 32,000 per kg (dry weight (dw)) and 34,000 per kg (dw), respectively, 2-4 orders of magnitude greater than loads previously reported in water and sediment. To further explore this sequestration of microplastics, fresh and aged Cladophora were mixed with aqueous mixtures of microfibers or microplastic in the laboratory to simulate pollution events. Microscopic analyses indicated that fresh Cladophora algae readily interacted with microplastics via adsorptive forces and physical entanglement. These interactions mostly cease upon algal senescence, with an expected release of microplastics in benthic sediments. Collectively, these findings suggest that synthetic microfibers are widespread in Cladophora algae and the affinity between microplastics and Cladophora may offer insights for removing microplastic pollution. Macroalgae in the Laurentian Great Lakes contain high loads of synthetic microfibers, both entangled and adsorbed, which likely account for an important fraction of microplastics in these surface waters.

J	Sassen, K; Campbell, JR				Sassen, K; Campbell, JR			A midlatitude cirrus cloud climatology from the facility for atmospheric remote sensing. Part I: Macrophysical and synoptic properties	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												A uniquely extensive high cloud dataset has been collected from the University of Utah Facility for Atmospheric Remote Sensing in support of the First (ISCCP) International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project Regional Experiment extended time observations satellite validation effort. Here in Part I of a series of papers examining the climatological properties of the cirrus clouds studied over Salt Lake City, Utah, similar to 2200 h of data collected from 1986-96 is used to create a subset of 1389 hourly polarization ruby (0.694 mum) lidar measurements of cloud layer heights. These data were obtained within +/-3 h of the local 0000 UTC National Weather Service radiosonde launches to provide reliable cloud temperature, pressure, and wind data. Future parts of this series will consider the inferred cirrus cloud microphysical and radiative properties. In addition to describing the cirrus macrophysical properties in terms of their yearly, seasonal, and monthly means and variabilities, the synoptic weather patterns responsible for the cirrus are characterized. The strong linkage between cirrus and weather is controlled by upper-air circulations mainly related to seasonally persistent intermountain region ridge/trough systems. The cloud-top heights of cirrus usually associated with jet streams tend to approach the local tropopause, except during the summer season due to relatively weak monsoonal convective activity. Although a considerable degree of variability exists, 10-yr average values for cirrus cloudbase/top properties are 8.79/11.2 km, 336.3/240.2 mb, -34.4 degrees/-53.9 degreesC, 16.4/20.2 m s(-1), and 276.3 degrees /275.7 degrees wind direction. The average cirrus layer physical thickness for single and multiple layers is 1.81 km. Estimates of cloud optical thickness tau based on a "thin'' (i.e., bluish) visual appearance suggest that tau less than or similar to 0.3 occur similar to 50% of the time for detected cirrus, implying that the cirrus in the region of study may be too tenuous to be effectively sampled using current satellite methods. The global representativeness of this extended cirrus cloud study is discussed.					; Campbell, James/C-4884-2012	Campbell, James/0000-0003-0251-4550; 													0022-4928						2001	58	5					481	496		10.1175/1520-0469(2001)058<0481:AMCCCF>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0469(2001)058<0481:AMCCCF>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000166964400005

The purpose of this secondary data analysis was to examine public perceptions of water-related environmental concerns in northwest Ohio. In fall 2015, nine focus groups on environmental health conditions were conducted with Lucas County, Ohio residents. Each 90-min focus group was videotaped and professionally transcribed to maximize data capture and facilitate data analysis. Colaizzi's (1978) method of content analysis was applied to make sense of the participants' environmental concerns related to water. The majority of the 93 participants were white females between the ages of 40 and 59. A do-not-drink advisory related to a harmful algal bloom in the summer of 2014 and the possibility of a future bloom were still prominent in residents' minds that affected their perceptions and behaviors 1 year later. The emergent themes included: (1) avoiding the use of tap water due to concerns about water quality, (2) mourning the loss of a precious resource and their childhood recreational activities, (3) believing there are financial impacts associated with water problems, (4) distrusting the actions and decisions of persons in authority, (5) wanting to stop fighting about who is to blame and determine the problem's real cause, and (6) desiring actions and planning by authorities to prevent future problems. Understanding public perceptions of water-related environmental concerns can inform practitioners worldwide on successful approaches to restoring trust, educating about and communicating risk, and planning for future issues.																			0364-152X	1432-1009				DEC	2019	64	6					689	700		10.1007/s00267-019-01217-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-019-01217-z		OCT 2019						31655863					WOS:000492652900002

Social affiliation and contact patterns among white-tailed deer in disparate landscapes: implications for disease transmission	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY												In social species, individuals contact members of the same group much more often than those of other groups, particularly for contacts that could directly transmit disease agents. This disparity in contact rates violates the assumptions of simple disease models, hinders disease spread between groups, and could decouple disease transmission from population density. Social behavior of white-tailed deer has important implications for the long-term dynamics and impact of diseases such as bovine tuberculosis and chronic wasting disease (CWD), so expanding our understanding of their social system is important. White-tailed deer form matrilineal groups, which inhabit stable home ranges that overlap somewhat with others-a pattern intermediate between mass-action and strict territoriality. To quantify how group membership affects their contact rates and document the spectrum of social affiliation, we analyzed location data from global positioning system (GPS) collars on female and juvenile white-tailed deer in 2 study areas: near Carbondale in forest-dominated southern Illinois (2002-2006) and near Lake Shelbyville in agriculture-dominated central Illinois (2006-2009). For each deer dyad (i.e., 2 individual deer with sufficient overlapping GPS data), we measured space-use overlap, correlation of movements, direct contact rate (simultaneous GPS locations < 10 m apart), and indirect contact rate (GPS locations < 10 m apart when offset by 1 or 3 days). Direct contact rates were substantially higher for within-group dyads than between-group dyads, but group membership had little apparent effect on indirect contact rates. The group membership effect on direct contact rates was strongest in winter and weakest in summer, with no apparent difference between study areas. Social affiliations were not dichotomous, with some deer dyads showing loose but positive affiliation. Even for obvious within-group dyads, their strength of affiliation fluctuated between years, seasons, and even days. Our findings highlight the poor fit between deer behavior and simple models of disease transmission and, combined with previous infection data, suggest that direct contact is the primary driver of CWD transmission among free-living female and juvenile white-tailed deer.					; Kjaer, Lene/LFS-6146-2024; Schauber, Eric/K-4043-2019	Schauber, Eric/0000-0002-0667-2604; Kjaer, Lene Jung/0000-0001-9659-4672; 													0022-2372	1545-1542				FEB	2015	96	1					16	28		10.1093/jmammal/gyu027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmammal/gyu027								26937044					WOS:000353334300004

New records of the non-native virile crayfish Faxonius virilis (Hagen, 1870) from the upper Snake River drainage and northern Bonneville Basin of the western United States	BIOINVASIONS RECORDS												The virile crayfish Faxonius virilis (Hagen, 1870) is a widespread non- native species across North America, and may be an emerging invasive species globally. We report new records for F. virilis from the upper Snake River drainage and northern Bonneville Basin of the western United States. We sampled 162 sites for crayfish during the summers of 2016 and 2017, detecting F. virilis at 22 of these sites, which ranged from small streams to wadeable rivers, as well as artificial reservoirs and a large natural lake (Bear Lake, Idaho and Utah). We also report the first records for F. virilis from the large, mainstem Snake River. However, we did not find F. virilis in the Snake River headwaters of western Wyoming, and detections of this species were few in the Snake River drainage below Shoshone Falls in south central Idaho. We also found no F. virilis in eastern Oregon. The widespread distribution of F. virilis in the upper Snake River drainage and northern Bonneville Basin may be a conservation concern for native crayfishes in this region, specifically the pilose crayfish Pacifastacus gambelii (Girard, 1852) and the Snake River pilose crayfish Pacifastacus connectens (Faxon, 1914). We recommend that research is undertaken to address ecological interactions of non-native F. virilis with native species, communities, and ecosystems in the western United States, and that education, outreach, and regulatory options be pursued to further limit the introduction and spread of this species.

Thirty-three hours of continuous observation showed that the lamination is formed daily with no changes in physicochemical properties except light intensity. Phylotype analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization indicate that Hydrogenophaga sp. is dominant and concentrated in diurnal layers containing abundant extracellular polymeric substances. Growth of Hydrogenophaga sp. is activated in the daytime, likely due to extracellular polymeric substance production by cyanobacterial photosynthesis. Daytime development of Hydrogenophaga-dominant biofilms, and the concurrent inhibiting effect on aragonite precipitation, explains the daily lamination observed.

Therefore, the role of Lake Urmia desiccated saline lands on local aerosols and rainwater compositions is still vague. This study investigates the temporal and seasonal patterns of rainwater chemistry from January 2018 to June 2018 (six months) in 13 stations throughout the Lake Urmia basin. The samples collected were analyzed using triple quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-QQQ) and ion chromatography (IC) to measure elemental and ionic concentrations. Then, the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model (HYSPLIT) was applied to identify the pathway and contribution of emissions. The results depict that the concentration of elemental and ionic components over different parts of the Lake Urmia basin are significantly different. West and north directions have the highest concentrations of marine ions associated with fewer toxic elements. In contrast, the east and south directions show a high concentration of heavy metal elements and ions. The high level of heavy and toxic elements at the east and south directions indicates that local anthropogenic sources are more influential. The seasonal and monthly variabilities of chemical compositions depict that the highest concentration of Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, K+, Cl-, Br-, NO3-, Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Co were in the spring season and SO42-, NH4+ and NO2- were highest in winter. Seasonal variation for MSA, organic acids (i.e., Pyruvate, Adipate, and Oxalate), Ni, Cu, Zn, V, and Ti were not apparent. Cluster-mean HYSPLIT backward trajectories results show the most dominant air mass sectors are from W (a: Iraq, Syria, and Arabian deserts; b: Mediterranean Sea; and c: KSA) and NE (the Caspian Sea and its vicinity), contributed to almost 65% and 22%, respectively. These air masses bring a significant quantity of crustal and marine aerosols, respectively. It is inferred that the Lake Urmia dried-up lakebeds have less impact on the contribution of emissions across the region.

The traps (n = 162 deployments) captured the larval or juvenile forms of Etheostoma crossopterum (Fringed Darter) (n = 188), Gambusia affinis (Western Mosquitofish) (n = 139), Hemitremia flammea (Flame Chub) (n = 55), the imperiled Fundulus julisia (Barrens Topminnow) (n = 10), and Forbesichthys agassizii (Spring Cavefish) (n = 1). The larval forms of four other species (Families Centrarchidae, Cyprinidae, and Cottidae) were not collected, despite the presence of adults. Larval Barrens Topminnow hatched over a protracted period (early June through late September); in contrast, hatching intervals were much shorter for Fringed Darter (mid-May through early June). Flame Chub hatching began before our first samples in early May and concluded by late-May. Juvenile Western Mosquitofish were collected between early June and late August. Our sampling revealed that at least two species (Flame Chub and Fringed Darter) were able to reproduce and recruit in habitats harboring the invasive Western Mosquitofish, while Barrens Topminnow could not.

J	Youn, YH				Youn, YH			The climate variabilities of air temperature around the Korean Peninsula	ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												In this study, changes in climatological conditions around the Korean Peninsula are estimated quantitatively using various types of high order statistical analyses. The temperature data collected from Incheon station have been analyzed for the assessment of the climate variation. According to our analysis, the climate changes observed over the Korean Peninsula for the last century are similar to the global observational data in many respects. First of all, the warming trend [+1.5 degrees C (100 yr)(-1)] and the overall evolving pattern throughout the century are quite similar to each other. The temperature change in the Korean Peninsula is about two to three times larger than that of the global scale which may partially be ascribed to the influence of urbanization at mid and high latitudes. In this work, a new Winter Monsoon Index (WMI) is suggested based on the European continental scale circulation index (EUI) pattern. Our WMI is defined as the normalized sea level pressure (SLP) difference in the winter period between the centers of the East Sea and west of Lake Baikal in Siberia, the two eastern centers of the EU1 action patterns. A strong similarity is found between the time series of the WMI and surface air temperature at Incheon. The WMI has decreased gradually since the 1920s but has shifted to a rapid increasing trend in the last two decades; it was in fact accompanied by a weakening of the Siberian High and a decreasing of the northerly during winter. Our findings of the close correlations between the surface air temperature at Incheon and the WMI strongly indicate that our newly suggested index is unique and can be used as an efficient tool to predict climate variability in Korea.																			0256-1530					JUL	2005	22	4					575	584		10.1007/BF02918489	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02918489													WOS:000230684600009

Lakes serve as excellent archives, preserving sediments with microfauna and flora that reflect past paleoclimatic conditions. In this study, we retrieved a 1.36 m long sediment core from the Anshupa Lake, Odisha, eastern India, to analyse shifts in the ISM during the last seven centuries. Anshupa Lake is located in the core monsoon zone (CMZ), which receives high rainfall during the summer season (June-September). Sediments in this lake thus preserve signatures of changes in ISM precipitation. The chronology of the analysed sediment core is based on eight AMS C-14 dates, giving an age range from similar to 1297 CE (653 BP) to the Present. The combined sedimentological and geochemical records revealed significant phases: 1297-1480 CE showed humid conditions, indicating a wet phase during the transition from the Medieval Climate Anomaly to the Little Ice Age (LIA). From 1480 to 1660 CE, high clay content and Fe/Mn ratio indicated increased aridity, suggesting a dry LIA phase. The interval 1660-1900 CE, with high proportions of silt and sand, was marked as a wet LIA phase with enhanced precipitation and an active monsoon system. Since 1900 CE, changes in sediment composition indicated a decline in precipitation aligned with a gradual increase towards the end of the 20th century. Solar insolation and the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) are key forcing factors responsible for ISM variability on a centennial scale.

J	Vincent, AC; Mueller, DR; Vincent, WF				Vincent, Aaron C.; Mueller, Derek R.; Vincent, Warwick F.			Simulated heat storage in a perennially ice-covered high Arctic lake: Sensitivity to climate change	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Perennially ice-covered, meromictic lakes occur along the northern coast of Ellesmere Island in the Canadian high Arctic and have distinctive conductivity and temperature profiles. They are salinity stratified and have deep thermal maxima that persist throughout the year at temperatures up to 60 degrees C above the winter minimum in the overlying atmosphere. Heat transfer in one of these lakes (Lake A, latitude 83.0 degrees N, longitude 75.4 degrees W) was simulated using a high spatial resolution model based on a one-dimensional heat diffusion and radiative transfer equation, which was solved through numerical integration. Boundary conditions were forced using climate data from an automated weather station installed next to the lake. There was a good fit between simulated and observed water column temperatures, including the midwater temperature maximum of 8.5 degrees C, after 63 years of heating ( RMSE = 0.10 degrees C). This suggests that Lake A became ice-free in the 1940s, a known period of intense warming of the circumpolar Arctic. The model was sensitive to forcing by photosynthetically active radiation ( PAR, 400 - 700 nm), in addition to optically related parameters such as surface reflectance, snow and ice cover, and the PAR diffuse attenuation coefficient. The unusual thermal structure is affected by stratified layers of pigmented microbial communities, which enhance the absorption of solar radiation. Simulation of ice-free summers revealed that the lake's thermal profile would lose its characteristic shape over several decades and that ongoing climate change could reduce the thermal maximum from 8.5 degrees to 4 degrees C within 50 years.					; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019	Mueller, Derek/0000-0003-1974-319X; Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; Vincent, Aaron/0000-0003-3872-0743													2169-9275	2169-9291				APR 26	2008	113	C4							C04036	10.1029/2007JC004360	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007JC004360													WOS:000255460900002
J	Specht, NF; Claussen, M; Kleinen, T				Specht, Nora Farina; Claussen, Martin; Kleinen, Thomas			Simulated range of mid-Holocene precipitation charges from extended lakes and wetlands over North Africa	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Enhanced summer insolation over North Africa induced a monsoon precipitation increase during the mid-Holocene, about 6000 years ago, and led to a widespread expansion of lakes and wetlands in the present-day Sahara. This expansion of lakes and wetlands is documented in paleoenvironmental sediment records, but the spatially sparse and often discontinuous sediment records provide only a fragmentary picture. Previous simulation studies prescribed either a small lake and wetland extent from reconstructions or focused on documented mega-lakes only to investigate their effect on the mid-Holocene climate. In contrast to these studies, we investigate the possible range of mid-Holocene precipitation changes in response to a small-lake extent and a potential maximum lake and wetland extent. Our study shows that during the summer monsoon season, the African rain belt is shifted about 2 to 7 degrees farther north in simulations with a maximum lake or wetland extent than in simulations with a small lake extent. This northward extent is caused by a stronger and prolonged monsoon rainfall season over North Africa which is associated with an increased monsoon precipitation over the southern Sahara and an increased precipitation from tropical plumes over the northwestern Sahara. Replacing lakes with vegetated wetlands causes an enhanced precipitation increase, which is likely due to the high surface roughness of the wetlands. A moisture budget analysis reveals that both lakes and wetlands cause a local precipitation increase not only by enhanced evaporation but also by a stronger inland moisture transport and local moisture recycling to the south of Lake Chad and the west Saharan lakes. Analysis of the dynamic response shows that lakes and wetlands cause a circulation response inverse to the one associated with the Saharan heat low. Depending on the latitudinal position of the lakes and wetlands, they predominantly cause a northward shift or a decay of the African Easterly Jet. These results indicate that the latitudinal position of the lakes and wetlands strongly affects the northward extension of the African summer monsoon.					; Kleinen, Thomas/G-5666-2018	Claussen, Martin/0000-0001-6225-5488; Kleinen, Thomas/0000-0001-9550-5164													1814-9324	1814-9332				MAY 13	2022	18	5					1035	1046		10.5194/cp-18-1035-2022	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-18-1035-2022													WOS:000794516900001

In a typical large, shallow lake, ice and snow processes (cover) and under-ice thermodynamics were monitored for four winters in 2015-2019. Heat transfer at the ice-water interface and lake heat budget were investigated. The results revealed that persistent bare ice of 35-50 cm thickness transmits 20 %-35 % of the incident solar radiation into the water below. This is a dominant source for under-ice energy flows and causes/maintains high water temperature (up to 6-8 degrees C) and high heat flux from water to ice (averages of 20-45 W m(-2)) in mid-winter, as well as higher heat conduction in the ice interior during freezing. The heat balance shows that the transmitted radiation and the heat flux from water to ice are the dominant and highly correlated heat flows in the lake. Both bulk water temperature and temperature structure are sensitive to solar transmittance and occasional snow events. Under-ice convective mixing does not necessarily occur because of stratification of salinity in the water body. In particular, salt exclusion during freezing changes both the bulk salinity and the salinity profile, which plays a major role in the stability and mixing of the water column in this shallow lake.

J	VADAS, RL				VADAS, RL			THE SPRINGTIME PHYTOPLANKTON OF 2 CALCAREOUS PONDS IN OHIO	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Limnological comparisons of two small, calcareous ponds in central Ohio were made during the spring of 1982, with weekly samples of phytoplankton and physicochemical parameters. Golden-brown algae consistently dominated both ponds. Differences in phytoplankton assemblages between the ponds were quantitative (relative abundance) rather than qualitative (genera composition) and probably resulted from differences in alkalinity and silica levels. Although generic diversity of phytoplankton increased during the spring in both ponds, assemblage structure was consistent among weeks because of the continued dominance of the same algal genera. Diversity, multivariate, and other analyses at the genera level were useful and complimentary methods for describing these plankton assemblages. A review of literature, however, suggests that use of higher taxonomic levels may be more useful for examining biotic integrity of lentic ecosystems, because the complexity of biotic and abiotic factors controlling algal composition makes species- or genus-level analyses intractable and inefficient for assessing water-quality problems.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				DEC	1992	7	4					407	418		10.1080/02705060.1992.9664710	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1992.9664710													WOS:A1992KD81500007

In vitro assessment of the genotoxicity and immunotoxicity of treated and untreated municipal effluents and receiving waters in freshwater organisms	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Municipal wastewater effluent is one of the largest sources of pollution entering surface waters in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Exposure to wastewater effluent has been associated with impaired immune systems and induction of genotoxicity to aquatic animals. Due to habitat degradation and environmental pollution linked to industrial development and population growth, several regions of the Great Lakes have been designated Areas of Concern (AOCs). In this study, we assessed the effect of extracts of sewage influent, (treated) effluent and receiving surface waters from the Hamilton Harbour AOC and the Toronto and Region AOC (Ontario, Canada) on the phagocytic immune response of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) kidney leukocytes and the genotoxicity (DNA strand breaks) of these extracts on freshwater mussel (Eurynia dilatata) hemocytes. We identified and quantified numerous chemicals present in the various samples extracted for exposure. In freshwater mussels, extracts from Hamilton Harbour AOC induced DNA damage with the most frequency (12 out of 28 samples) regardless of sample type, reflecting past and present industrial activities. In contrast, extracts from Toronto and Region AOC induced DNA damage infrequently (2 out of 32 (summer) and 5 out of 32 (fall) samples, respectively) and from different WWTPs at different times. None of the extracts induced any significant effect on phagocytosis of rainbow trout kidney leukocytes. The present study indicates that despite overall improvements to effluent quality, treatment of influent by WWTPs may not result in a corresponding improvement of the genotoxicity of effluents. In vitro bioassays are useful and cost-effective rapid-screening tools for preliminary assessments of contamination of aquatic ecosystems.

Only 0.007% of freshwater is found in rivers, lakes and in the atmosphere - the easy access water to human being. Brazil has 13.7% of surface freshwater in the World and 70% of this amount is at Amazon. The other 30% are distributed throughout the country. The growing of water needed by the population concentration and the water disponibility in certain areas demands to plan how to use this water.

A model study of the effect of weather forcing on the ecology of a meromictic Siberian lake	JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY												We used a Lake Shira numerical model to estimate the response of the ecosystem of a saline meromictic lake to variations in weather parameters during the growing season. The sensitivity analysis of the model suggests that compared to other external (nutrient inflows) and internal (spring biomasses of food-web components) factors, weather parameters are among the most influential for both mixolimnetic (phyto- and zooplankton) and monimolimnetic (purple sulfur bacteria, sulfur reducing bacteria and hydrogen sulfide) food-web components. Calculations with different weather scenarios shows how changes in the water temperature and mixing depth affect mixolimnetic and monimolimnetic food-web components and the depth of the oxic-anoxic interface in a meromictic lake. When weather forcing stimulates an increase in the biomass of food-web components in the mixolimnion, it produces cascading effects that lead to three results: 1) a higher content of detritus in the water column; 2) a higher content of hydrogen sulfide in the monimolimnion; 3) raising of the oxic-anoxic interface closer to the water-air surface. This cascading effect is complicated by the negative correlation between two light dependent primary producers located at different depths-phytoplankton in the mixolimnion and purple sulfur bacteria at the oxic-anoxic interface. Thus, weather conditions that stimulate higher phytoplankton biomass are associated with a higher detritus content and lower biomass of purple sulfur bacteria, a higher content of hydrogen sulfide and a shallower oxic-anoxic interface. The same weather conditions (higher wind, lower cloud cover, and lower air temperature) promote a scenario of less stable thermal stratification. Thus, our calculations suggest that weather parameters during the summer season strongly control the mixing depth, water temperature and the mixolimnetic food web. An effect of biogeochemical and physical interactions on the depth of the oxic-anoxic interface is also detectable. However, infra- and interannual climate and weather efforts will be more important for the control of meromixis stability.

Internal phosphorus loading in a chain of eutrophic hardwater lakes in Saskatchewan, Canada	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Sediments can act as a source or sink of phosphorus (P) for the water column of lakes. In iron (Fe) -rich softwater lakes, redox processes are important contributors to sediment P flux. However, the contribution of redox processes to P flux in hardwater lakes, with high pH and high concentrations of redox-insensitive calcium (Ca) is unknown. Intact sediment cores, collected in different seasons (summer or fall) from a chain of eutrophic hardwater lakes in southeastern Saskatchewan, Canada, were used to quantify sediment P fluxes in laboratory incubations under hypoxic or oxic conditions at temperatures consistent with the season of sample collection. Geochemical analyses determined concentrations of sediment total (TP) and organic P (TP o ), organic matter (OM), total Ca and magnesium, and total and extractable manganese, Fe and aluminum. Sediment P pools were determined using sequential fractionation and solution 31 P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Sediment P fluxes were significantly higher in sediment cores incubated under hypoxic conditions (-24.4 to 28.5 mg P m - 2 d -1 ) than oxic conditions (-60.3 to 14.2 mg P m - 2 d -1 ). There were significant seasonal and lake differences for TP, TP o and cation concentrations, with Ca the dominant cation in all but one lake. Phosphate bound in the redox-sensitive pool was the only sediment P fraction that significantly differed among the lakes (0.10 to 0.18 mg P g -1 d.w.; 9 to 16 % of TP), with an inverse relationship to sediment P flux. Principal component analysis suggests that high concentrations of internally -generated TP o forms and OM in surface sediments play a key role in internal P loading in these lakes. However, sediment Ca appears to have an overriding effect on sediment P, partially masking the impact of redox control on internal P loading in these hardwater prairie lakes.					; WauchopeThompson, Michelle/LZH-6401-2025; Baulch, Helen/I-9529-2012	Cade-Menun, Barbara/0000-0003-4391-3718; Baulch, Helen/0000-0001-9018-4998; Wauchope-Thompson, Michelle/0000-0002-6069-5436													0048-9697	1879-1026				MAY 10	2024	924								171493	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171493	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171493		MAR 2024						38458448					WOS:001217896700001

Martin			Climatological Characteristics of Atmospheric Rivers and Their Inland Penetration over the Western United States	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Narrow corridors of water vapor transport known as atmospheric rivers (ARs) contribute to extreme precipitation and flooding along the West Coast of the United States, but knowledge of their influence over the interior is limited. Here, the authors use Interim European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) data, Climate Prediction Center (CPC) precipitation analyses, and Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) observations to describe the characteristics of cool-season (November-April) ARs over the western United States. It is shown that AR frequency and duration exhibit a maximum along the Oregon-Washington coast, a strong transition zone upwind (west) of and over the Cascade-Sierra ranges, and a broad minimum that extends from the high Sierra south of Lake Tahoe eastward across the central Great Basin and into the deep interior. East of the Cascade-Sierra ranges, AR frequency and duration are largest over the interior northwest, while AR duration is large compared to AR frequency over the interior southwest. The fractions of cool-season precipitation and top-decile 24-h precipitation events attributable to ARs are largest over and west of the Cascade-Sierra ranges. Farther east, these fractions are largest over the northwest and southwest interior, with distinctly different large-scale patterns and AR orientations enabling AR penetration into each of these regions. In contrast, AR-related precipitation over the Great Basin east of the high Sierra is rare. These results indicate that water vapor depletion over major topographic barriers is a key contributor to AR decay, with ARs playing a more prominent role in the inland precipitation climatology where lower or less continuous topography facilitates the inland penetration of ARs.

J	Bertoni, R; Callieri, C				Bertoni, R; Callieri, C			Effects of UVB radiation on freshwater autotrophic and heterotrophic picoplankton in a subalpine lake	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The effects of UVB radiation on the activity of heterotrophic (HPP) and autotrophic (APP) picoplankton (0.2-2 mu m) and of autotrophic assemblages >2 mu m has been measured and compared. Under natural UVB irradiance in a large, deep, oligotrophic subalpine lake (Lago Maggiore, 45 degrees 55'N) with mean dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations of 1 mg C l(-1), the microorganisms of the two size fractions were not significantly photoinhibited in their autotrophic and heterotrophic activities. The vertical attenuation coefficient (K-d) for irradiance at 305 nm ranged from 1.45 to 1.67 during spring and summer. The mixing layer extended to a greater depth than the layer affected by UVB radiation (z(1%) < z(mix)), thus enabling the microorganisms living there to photoadapt. As the assimilation numbers of APP and nanoplankton were higher at 2 m depth than near the surface, we suspected that the influence of longer wavelength (UVA, photosynthetically active radiation) could be stronger than UVB in affecting the photosynthetic efficiency of natural populations. The artificial increase in UVB irradiance had a higher detrimental effect on HPP due to their smaller size, less protection and indirect effects through autotrophic cell inhibition. Picocyanobacteria were percentually more affected by UVB than nanoplankton during April due to the presence of diatoms, which are more resistant than other algal groups to solar UVB irradiance. Furthermore, picocyanobacteria had lower assimilation numbers with respect to larger phytoplankton in the quartz tubes during stratification.																			0142-7873					JUL	1999	21	7					1373	1388		10.1093/plankt/21.7.1373	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/21.7.1373													WOS:000081789500010

Using a winter 2006 waterbird survey, we examined the relationships among metrics of bird community diversity and abundance and landscape characteristics of 51 wetland sub-lakes derived by an object-based classification of Landsat satellite data. Relative importance of predictors and their sets was assessed using information-theoretic model selection and the Akaike Information Criterion. Ordinary least squares regression models were diagnosed and corrected for spatial autocorrelation using spatial autoregressive lag and error models. The strongest and most consistent landscape predictors included Normalized Difference Vegetation Index for mudflat (negative effect) and emergent grassland (positive effect), total sub-lake area (positive effect), and proportion of submerged vegetation (negative effect). Significant spatial autocorrelation in linear regression was associated with local clustering of response and predictor variables, and should be further explored for selection of wetland sampling units and management of protected areas. Overall, results corroborate the utility of remote sensing to elucidate potential indicators of waterbird diversity that complement logistically challenging ground observations and offer new hypotheses on factors underlying community distributions.

Plant height, floral debris drop, water quality, and bacterial counts were measured and contrasted between the two systems. Anopheles spp. and C. tarsalis populations in wild rice were 6 and 2.6 times higher, respectively, than in the white rice over the entire season. A significantly greater number of notonectids and hydrophilid larvae were sampled in the wild rice treatments and did not appear to be responsible for the difference in larval mosquito populations. A positive correlation was found between average larval density and plant height for Anopheles spp. in both wild and white rice and for C. tarsalis in wild rice during the early growing season. In the latter half of the growing season, only Anopheles spp. densities showed a significant correlation with plant height. A significant positive correlation was demonstrated between the number of shed wild rice anthers and larval densities for both Anopheles spp. and C. tarsalis. No significant differences were noted in either water quality factors or bacterial counts between white and wild rice treatments. In the field, development of C. tarsalis larvae was slower in wild rice than in white rice plots before flowering but faster during flowering. However, temperature-adjusted developmental times were significantly shorter for the wild rice group only during flowering. In the laboratory, C. tarsalis completed development from second instar to adult when fed only wild rice pollen. These results suggest that wild rice pollen serves as a nutrient source for larvae in the field. In addition, the floral components of wild rice may serve as an oviposition attractant and structural refuge for the immature stages.																			0046-225X					DEC	1992	21	6					1294	1300		10.1093/ee/21.6.1294	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/21.6.1294													WOS:A1992KD28200009

The occurrence of ASs in aquatic environments in China has rarely been reported. In this study, we determined the concentration of seven ASs in surface water and sediment samples from 16 lakes in Wuhan. The sum of the ASs concentration ranged from 0.89 to 20.6 mu g/L in the surface water, with a mean value of 4.96 +/- 5.16 mu g/L. The most abundant AS was sucralose (SUC), with a concentration from 0.33 to 18.0 mu g/L, followed by acesulfame (ACE) (0.40-2.78 mu g/L), saccharin (SAC) (< MDL to 1.86 mu g/L), and cyclamate (CYC) (< MDL to 2.22 mu g/L). SUC and ACE accounted for 90% +/- 8% of the total ASs in the surface water. The Sigma(4) ASs sediment concentrations ranged from 1.71 to 6.49 ng/g of the dry weight (dw, mean value 3.03 +/- 1.03 ng/g dw). SAC, CYC, and ACE were detected in sediments (< MDL to 4.17 ng/g dw), with SAC as the dominant AS. In surface water, the Sigma(4) ASs concentrations of Hanyang station were higher than those of Hankou, while the Sigma(4) ASs concentrations in sediment samples from different regions showed no significant difference. The ASs concentrations in the surface water and sediment in winter were significantly higher than those in summer. Relatively higher concentrations and detected frequencies of SUC and ACE were found in surface water samples, whereas these two ASs were absent in background samples, which indicates that SUC and ACE can be used as potential indicators of wastewater contamination in Wuhan, China.

Since the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States periods, historical documents have recorded many events of the Yellow River's migration and diversion, but there are few records of earlier events. The ancient Daluze Lake, located in the transitional area between the North China Plain and the Taihang Mountains, has been greatly affected by the Yellow River's flooding throughout history. The sediment in the lake continuously recorded the regional environmental evolution information, which is of significant value for studying prehistoric floods of the Yellow River and the interactive effects of early human activities and natural environment. Using a combination of geophysical, geochemical, and biological properties of drilling sediments, we establish the climate and vegetation evolution history in the ancient Daluze region since the Middle Holocene, and discuss a migration event of the Yellow River in the Middle Holocene. The results suggest that: 1) Since Mid-Holocene, the ancient vegetation of the Daluze area has always been a temperate mixed coniferous-broadleaf forest type of sparse forest-grassland, but its internal structure has changed: the local vegetation experienced a transition from sparse forest-grassland vegetation to grassland-meadow expansion, while in the middle of the Holocene (similar to ca. 4.04 ka) forest vegetation began to show a growth trend. 2) At about ca. 4.04 ka, an environmental anomaly event occurred in the ancient Daluze area, with grain size and other indicators changed significantly, indicating that the Yellow River may have undergone a migration: the mainstream of the Yellow River changed from northward to southward and forced the ancient humans of the Longshan Culture and Dawenkou Culture periods to construct ramparts to prevent flood disasters caused by the migration of the mainstream of the Yellow River. The study deepens the understanding of the environmental evolution history and human-environment relationship of the Daluze area to some extent, and provides some theoretical basis for local ecological restoration and sustainable development.

The Holocene Optimum, which was resulted from a strengthening of the East Asian (EA) summer monsoon, occurred in the early and mid Holocene (ca. 10-6 cal. ka BP). In the mid and late Holocene (ca. 6-3 cal. ka BP), a prevailing dry climate suggested a weakening of the EA summer monsoon. The general trend of Holocene climatic changes in this study agrees with the 25 degrees N summer solar insolation, suggesting that orbitally induced insolation may have played an important role in the Holocene climate in the study region.

Water column stability derived from one-dimensional hydrodynamical models	MANAGEMENT OF LAKES AND RESERVOIRS DURING GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE	NATO ADVANCED SCIENCE INSTITUTES SERIES, SUB-SER 2, ENVIRONMENTAL SECURITY				NATO Advanced Research Workshop on Management of Lakes and Reservoirs During Global Climate Change	NOV, 1995	PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC	NATO, Sci Comm				The physical background for studying the development of spring algal blooms in intermittently turbulent waters is developed. A mathematical model based upon transient Ekman dynamics is used to formulate the conservation of mean momentum and heat energy in their one-dimensional form. The turbulent exchange coefficients are calculated with a two-equation kappa - epsilon model of turbulence. A 10-day episode of observed meteorological conditions at Lake Constance is calculated and compared to observed temperatures in the water column. During calm and moderate winds good agreement is obtained. The effect of the hypothetical insertion of an increased wind speed lasting for 1 day is studied and discussed. The concept of a vertical exchange rate p(ki) between defined layers is formulated and proposed as a simple but reliable predictor for stratification and, thus, for the onset of spring algal growth in deep lakes.																					0-7923-5055-3				1998	42						57	70																WOS:000076501300004

Detection of glacier lakes buried under snow by RISAT-1 SAR in the Himalayan terrain	CURRENT SCIENCE												Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signals penetrate through the dry snow and cloud providing crucial data over the Himalayan temperate glaciers and complement the optical images. In the present study, RISAT1 C band and AWiFS images of winter/ablation period over Samudra Tapu and Gepang Gath moraine dammed lakes (MDLs) in Himachal Pradesh have been analysed. Backscattering coefficient of the lake was observed to be low throughout the year. Penetration depth of SAR into dry snowpack was calculated to vary from 4 to 22 m for a range of snow density (0.1-0.5 g/cm(3)), whereas it was estimated to be 1.20-2.01 m based on ground observations for 30 January and 24 February 2013. The present study provides results of RISAT-1 C-band penetration up to similar to 2 m through the snowpack to detect MDLs in the Himalayan terrain. The detection of MDLs using the back-scattering images of winter season was validated with synchronous AWiFS sensor images.																			0011-3891					NOV 10	2015	109	9					1728	1732		10.18520/v109/i9/1728-1732	http://dx.doi.org/10.18520/v109/i9/1728-1732													WOS:000365438800038
J	BUSHNELL, JH				BUSHNELL, JH			ENVIRONMENTAL RELATIONS OF MICHIGAN ECTOPROCTA AND DYNAMICS OF NATURAL POPULATIONS OF PLUMATELLA REPENS	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Ecological information on Ectoprocta gathered from 122 bodies of water is presented. Fredericella sultana is more tolerant of conditions in strongly marl lakes, on lake bottoms, and under ice (1.5[degree]C). Plumatella fruticosa is more often associated with water of lower pH and greater color than other forms. Plumatella repens has high occurrence in a wide range of lentic situations. Paludicella articulata is adaptable to both lentic and lotic conditions. Frequency and intimacy of association of ectoprocts with plants is discussed and a plant association table is provided. Animal associations are described and probability levels are used to assess intra-ectoproct associations. Snails and insect larvae, notably Trichoptera (e.g. Athripsodes and Orthotrichia) are prominent predators. Growth, mortality, and longevity data were obtained for Plumatella repens. Plastic pegs were used to mark 672 colonies and 373 polypides on sub-strates in two natural lakes. Growth tended to be geometric, though sometimes erratic. Doubling rates at favorable sites were 3.4 to 7.4 days; 3.4 to 4.9 days in the summer, and 4.0 to 7.4 days in the spring. Patterns of growth and fluctuations of populations are discussed. Predation on P. repens was often high. Colonies of several hundred polypides were destroyed between two observation dates. The importance of site and chance is considered. P. repens polypides live from 4 to 53 days. The death rate was highest between 21 and and 36 days.																			0012-9615	1557-7015					1966	36	2					95	+		10.2307/1942151	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1942151													WOS:A19667556000002

The Sipoholon Geothermal Field and adjacent geothermal systems along the North-Central Sumatra Fault Belt, Indonesia: Reviews on geochemistry, tectonics, and natural heat loss	JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES												The Sipoholon system in the Tarutung Basin is one of five geothermal systems associated with a c. 100 km stretch of the Sumatra Fault System (SFS) in North-Central Sumatra, Indonesia, that exhibits parallel sets of dextral strike-slip faults associated with seismic activity. Characteristics of discharged thermal fluids differ significantly between the systems. The gas-rich Sipoholon field transfers only c. 19 MW heat by Ca-SO4/HCO3 springs with SiO2 fluid equilibria pointing to temperatures of 50-80 degrees C at intermediate depths. Most of its thermal springs (T < 63 degrees C) are associated with significant gas (CO2) discharges and travertine deposits but cannot be interpreted as manifestations of a medium to high temperature system. A deep exploratory well has not yet been drilled in the Sipoholon field. In contrast, all four thermal systems in the Sarulla Block concession to the southeast of the Sipoholon field are convective high temperature systems that transfer significant heat to the surface. Fumaroles, steaming ground, thermal springs, hot pools and thermal lakes discharge at least 50 MW heat at three of the four prospects where the temperatures of springs and fumaroles often reach boiling point. Many hot springs of the Sarulla Block systems discharge dominantly Na-HCO3/Cl type waters with partially equilibrated cation compositions, a result of fluid-rock equilibration and mixing processes. SiO2 fluid equilibria indicate 130 to c. 200 degrees C with cation geothermometers pointing to a high reservoir temperature (200-260 degrees C) for all four systems. This was confirmed by the first deep exploratory wells drilled c. 20 years ago in three prospects that encountered T > 250 degrees C at bottom hole (> 1.5 km depth). The structural setting of the five geothermal fields is complex. At Tarutung it is associated with the narrow Tarutung Basin, filled with volcanic debris and ash. The basin exhibits a partly exposed dextral strike-slip fault along its NE margin and can be interpreted in terms of a trans-tensional pull-apart basin. Two of the adjacent Sarulla Block systems are associated with large volcanic debris basins (Namora-I-Langit and Silangkitang) that exhibit 'half-graben' structures in profiles normal to two large active faults of the Sumatra Fault System (SFS). The other two systems (Donotasik and Sibualbuali) are hosted by an elongated graben structure parallel and within the SFS and by a stratovolcano respectively.																			1367-9120	1878-5786				FEB	2019	170						316	328		10.1016/j.jseaes.2018.11.007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jseaes.2018.11.007													WOS:000460713200023

Influence of Climate Changes on the Structure of Summer Phytoplankton in a Forest Zone Lake (Raifskoe, Volga-Kama Nature Reserve)	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												Climate change, which causes significant structural transformations of ecosystems, is becoming one of the most acute environmental problems of our time. Monitoring observations in protected areas, where anthropogenic impacts are minimal, reflect the effect of climate on natural communities. We have studied the change in the structure of summer phytoplankton in Lake Raifskoe (Volga-Kama Nature Reserve) for more than 20 years, as well as the relationship of these changes with environmental factors. This study has shown an increase in the proportion of dinophyte algae in the total biomass of summer phytoplankton in the lake, which is located in the forest zone. This change is more typical for the structure of lake communities in the forest-steppe zone. The leading role in the change in the structure of phytoplankton is played by climate, the air temperature of the warmest month (July) in particular. No effect of climate humidity (precipitation) on the phytoplankton community has been revealed. Our data show that current climate changes lead to rearrangements of phytoplankton communities, as a result of which the biomass structure of summer phytoplankton in the studied lake located in the forest zone of the Middle Volga region can acquire features of the structure of lake communities of the forest-steppe zone.

Spatiotemporal change of phosphorous speciation and concentration in stormwater in the St. Lucie Estuary watershed, South Florida	CHEMOSPHERE												Phosphorous (P) concentration in stormwater runoff varies at different spatial and temporal scales. Excessive P loading from agriculture system into the St. Lucie Estuary (SLE) contributed to water quality deterioration in southern Indian River Lagoon. This study examines the spatial and temporal shifts of different P forms in runoff and storm water under different land use, water management, and rainfall conditions. Storm water samplings were conducted monthly between April 2013 and December 2014 in typical farmland and along the waterway (Canal C-24) that connects lands to the SLE. Concentrations of different P forms and related water quality variables were measured. Approximately 89% of the collected water samples contained total P (17) concentrations exceeding the total maximum daily load (TMDL) level (0.081 mg L-1). Concentrations of different P forms declined from agricultural field furrows to the canal and then increased from the upstream to the downstream in the canal where urban activities dominated land use. Total dissolved P (TDP) was the predominant form of TP, followed by PO4-P. Speciation and concentrations of P varied with sites and sampling times, but were significantly higher in the summer months (from June to September) than in the winter. Water pH explained similar to 20% of TP variation. Spatiotemporal variations of P concentrations and compositions provide a data-based guide for development of best management practices (BMPs) to minimize P export from the SLE watershed.

Results showed that Poyang Lake wetland is an important wintering ground for oriental white storks, with an annual average population number of 2 305 +/- 326. The population sizes in 2004, 2005, 2010, and 2011 were higher than the highest-ever estimate of its global population. In 2005, we recorded 3 789 individuals, which was the maximum population number within the period of 1998-2011. The storks inhabited 52 lakes, with the greatest distance between these lakes being 180.3 km. The storks presented a clustered distribution pattern in the Poyang Lake wetland, irrespective of the number of individuals or occurrence frequencies. Shahu, Dahuchi, Banghu, and Hanchihu were most frequently used lakes and had the largest annual average numbers of storks. There was a significant positive correlation between occurrence frequency and annual average number of storks in the lakes. Most of the lakes important for storks were covered by existing nature reserves, though some lakes outside the reserves were also frequently used. About 64.9%+/- 5.5% of the storks were found in nature reserves. In addition, the storks more frequently used and clumped in significantly larger flocks in lakes within nature reserves than lakes outside.						wei, zhen hua/0000-0001-5454-3463													2095-8137					NOV 18	2016	37	6					338	346		10.13918/j.issn.2095-8137.2016.6.338	http://dx.doi.org/10.13918/j.issn.2095-8137.2016.6.338								28105798					WOS:000397991300003
J	Liversage, K				Liversage, Kiran			Observations of relic intertidal assemblages in an inland marine-spring of Eyre Peninsula, South Australia	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA												Marine-springs containing relic intertidal species can be used to observe how assemblages usually found only on open coasts are structured when free from disturbances associated with water movement. This study tested if two previously described patterns from disturbance-prone boulder habitats occurred within a South Australian marine-spring. I aimed to determine how species are associated with the interface between boulders and the surface of the bottom sediment, a habitat feature suggested to be important for some key benthic invertebrates. Testing species associations to this feature is normally difficult because boulders and sediment are regularly disturbed, but on stable marine-spring boulders, fine-scale associations of species with this interface could be measured. Also investigated was a previously described negative correlation of peracaridan (Crustacea) densities with boulder size. This could possibly occur due to variability in disturbance related to boulder-size/stability, in which case the correlation would not be expected in this sheltered lake. Seven rocky-benthic marine species were found. The boulder-sediment interface could be easily located on overturned boulders. An anemone (Isanemonia australis) was highly abundant within 5mm of this interface, providing evidence of this habitat feature's importance. As found previously, correlations were significant between boulder size and densities of peracaridans (in this case, the isopod Zuzara venosa). This correlation, which has been described widely for similar species, has previously been attributed to disturbance. This study found it occurring in extremely sheltered environments, however, so disturbance is unlikely to be involved. Additional larger-scale comparisons could provide further information about the effects of sheltered/exposed conditions on these taxa.

Two extensive sampling campaigns were conducted in summer and winter low-flow conditions. Composite sediment samples were collected from ten reaches of the main river: the first was located in the upper region (ambient control), and the others downstream of the confluences of nine principal tributaries. The two sampling programs were paralleled by contemporary investigations on the macroinvertebrate community. The particle-size composition along the Po River showed a relatively uniform distribution of fine sand, a progressive downstream decrease of coarse sands and a corresponding increase of fine materials. The levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), extractable organo halides (EOX), Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn were determined in sediment fine particles (< 63 mum), and showed marked changes across the ten river reaches. Their longitudinal trends, as those of organic carbon and total nitrogen, were very similar and largely independent of the survey season. Sediment quality benchmarks were used to evaluate sediment chemistry, and, although the overall level of contamination was from moderate to low, the reaches located downstream of the tributaries Dora Riparia, Dora Baltea, Lambro and Oglio were considered to be at risk. Sediments were tested for toxicity on Oncorhynchus mykiss, Ceriodaphnia dubia, Raphidocelis subcapitata and Vibrio fischeri. The toxicity tests were conducted both with sediment extracts and whole samples. Sediment extracts showed toxic potentials that were consistent with the spatial distribution of contaminants. Whole-sediment toxicity showed moderate/low effects which also included false positives and negatives. Alterations of the macroinvertebrate community were found for many kilometers downstream of Dora Riparia, and with a seasonal dependence, also in other reaches of the Italian river. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to describe the longitudinal and temporal changes of the Po River, and allowed the selection of the most useful and discriminating indicators.

AQUATIC BOTANY												Submerged plant dominance and a turbid state with few submerged plants have been hypothesized to represent alternative stable states in eutrophic shallow lakes. Here, we analyze the conditions for occurrence of alternative stable states in shallow lakes further, using Charisma, a simulation model describing the growth of Chara aspera. The model includes seasonality and spatial structure, aspects which were absent in earlier models predicting alternative equilibria. The parameterization of the model is largely based on experimental results and field observations. Over a range of conditions, the model does indeed predict alternative stable states. The range of conditions over which alternative stable states exist, appeared most sensitive to the assumed reduction of local turbidity by plants and the maximum growth rate of the plants. Aboveground biomass disappears during winter in most lakes in temperate regions. Our analysis indicates that from an evolutionary perspective there is an optimum biomass allocation strategy with respect to investment in overwintering structures. Too little investment reduces chances to regain dominance in the subsequent year, whereas too much investment in dormant overwintering structures such as seeds and tubers reduces photosynthesis. Interestingly, the optimal investment is lower for obtaining maximal summer biomass than for realizing the maximum stability of the vegetated state. The model also suggests that a short clear-water phase enhances the probability of vegetation survival. The optimal timing for a clear-water phase is at the end of May or in June, as is indeed the case in many lakes. In line with earlier theory, shallow lakes with a 'flat' depth profile are predicted to have the strongest hysteresis. In lakes with a depth gradient, the response to changes in turbidity is predicted to depend strongly on horizontal mixing of the water between vegetation stands and the open water. Hysteresis disappears predominantly due to a strong horizontal mixing of water. In case of little mixing, on the other hand, local alternative stable states are predicted to occur.

J	Junginger, A; Trauth, MH				Junginger, Annett; Trauth, Martin H.			Hydrological constraints of paleo-Lake Suguta in the Northern Kenya Rift during the African Humid Period (15-5 ka BP)	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												During the African Humid Period (AHP, 15-5 ka BP) an almost 300 m deep paleo-lake covering 2200 km(2) developed in the Suguta Valley, in the Northern Kenya Rift Data from lacustrine sediments and paleo-shorelines indicate that a large paleo-lake already existed by 13.9 ka BP, and record rapid water level fluctuations of up to 100 m within periods of 100 years or less, and a final lowstand at the end of the AHP (5 ka BP). We used a hydro-balance model to assess the abruptness of these water level fluctuations and identify their causes. We observed that fluctuations within the AHP were caused by abrupt changes in precipitation of 26-40%. Despite the absence of continuous lacustrine data documenting the onset of the AHP in the Suguta Valley, we conclude from the hydro-balance model that only an abrupt onset to the AHP, prior to 14.8 ka BP, could have led to high water levels recorded. The modeling results suggest that the sudden increase in rainfall was the direct consequence of an eastward migration of the Congo Air Boundary (CAB), caused by an enhanced atmospheric pressure gradient between East Africa and southern Asia during a northern hemisphere (NH) summer insolation maximum. In contrast the end of the AHP must have been gradual despite an abrupt change in the source of precipitation when a decreasing pressure gradient between Asia and Africa prevented the CAB from reaching the study area. This abruptness was probably buffered by a contemporaneous change in precession producing an insolation maximum at the equator during September-October. This change would have meant that the only rain source was the Intertropical Convergence Zone (IT CZ), which would have carried a greater amount of moisture during the short rainy season thus slowing the fall in water level over a period of about 1000 years in association with the reduction in insolation. The results of this study provide an indication of the amount of time available for humans in north-eastern Africa to adapt in response to a changing climate, from hunting and gathering to farming and herding.

Assessment of physico-chemical parameters of surface waters of a tropical brackish water lake in South Asia	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Brackish lake systems and estuaries are unique aquatic systems that support diversified life forms and strongly influence a region's economy. Major chemical water quality parameters of India's second-largest brackish water lake, Pulicat were assessed. Physico-chemical parameters like pH, temperature, suspended solid concentrates, total dissolved solids, salinity, nitrogenous nutrients, phosphate, silicate, and chlorophyll a were analysed. The results obtained for different parameters were compared and interpreted with statistical software SPSS version 20 and images were plotted using the Arc GIS spatial analyst tool. During the summer months, the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio ranges from a minimum of 1.96 to a maximum of 16.64 (9.55 +/- 4.01) while it ranges from a minimum of 7.98 to a maximum of 15.52 (12.47 +/- 2) during the pre-monsoon. In the monsoon season, the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio of surface water suggests a range from a minimum of 8.64 to a maximum of 17.58 (13.87 +/- 2.14). During the post-monsoon season, the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio ranges from 4.98 to 17.34 (11.77 +/- 3.68). The average nitrogen to phosphorus ratios were 9.6, 12.5, 13.9 and 11.8 in summer, pre -monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon respectively. The nitrogen to phosphorus ratio was lower than the Redfield ratio for all the seasons. The average concentration of chlorophyll a was 14.9, 13.4, 12.8 and 11.8 in summer, pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon respectively. As per the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, there was no significant correlation among nitrogen, phosphorus, and chlorophyll a. This suggests the influence of suspended solid concentrates, and nitrogen and phosphorus flux in the sediment-water interface might be interfering with the nutrient cycles and primary productivity.

Nine seismic units (A-I) are identified in the enclosed basin, along with two regionally developed sequence boundaries (SB1 and SB2) and two tidal ravinement surfaces (tRS1 and tRS2). The lowermost sequence boundary (SB1) is related to regional late-Pliocene hinterland uplift. SB2 is related to the last glacial maximum (LGM) when sea levels fell similar to 130 m below present. Lowstand fluvial sediments occupy the base of both SB1 and SB2 incisions. Thick central basin deposits dominate the valley fills, more so in the Pliocene age valleys, the occurrence and thickness of which is attributed to sheltering by a seaward barrier-dune system as well as to the low gradient settings. Prograding tidal bedforms occupy the minor incisions formed within the tidal ravinement surfaces, marking the onset of lagoonal conditions in the area. The system is capped by lagoonal deposits, deposited above tidal flats. A series of prograding spits mark the early stages of lagoonal segmentation in the Holocene. The preservation of only one incision and fill sequence prior to the development of an LGM-aged valley succession is attributed to geological inheritance whereby older valleys were repeatedly re-incised by younger valleys throughout the Pleistocene, causing partial preservation of Pleistocene fills up to the most recent cycle. The older fill remnant relates to a larger magnitude base level fall prior to the Quaternary, which survived erosion during subsequent sea-level falls. Adjacent topography in the form of rocky cliffs and the seaward fronting barrier limit the accommodation space in which infilling material can be hosted outside the major valley network. The competent basement rock into which these valleys have incised protected lowstand fluvial sediments from subsequent tidal ravinement.

J	LIANG, LH; KERSHAW, GP				LIANG, LH; KERSHAW, GP			CLIMATE-CHANGE IN THE MACKENZIE MOUNTAINS, NWT, CANADA	CLIMATE RESEARCH												It has been asserted that climate change will be most expressed at high latitudes. To test whether recent climate records contain evidence of change several northern stations were analyzed in and adjacent to the Mackenzie Mountains, N.W.T., Canada. It was found that the mean annual air temperature increased by 3.6 degrees C (1968 to 1992) at Ross River, 1.6 degrees C (1974 to 1982) at Tsichu River, 1.8 degrees C (1966 to 1990) at Tungsten and 0.9 degrees C (1943 to 1992) at Norman Wells. The Norman Wells temperature rise was less than the other stations, however after 1980 the rise was of a greater magnitude. The magnitude of mean annual temperature rise increased from east to west over the 500 km between the most distant stations. Mean summer rainfall for Ross River, Tungsten, Tsichu River and Sheldon Lake increased by 6, 86, 51, and 50 mm, respectively. Norman Wells rainfall decreased by about 42 mm. Annual rainfall, snowfall and precipitation were relatively stable at Ross River, but decreased by about 36 mm (1962 to 1992) at Norman Wells. For Tungsten, over the period from 1960 to 1991, it increased by about 250 mm. Results from an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model suggest that the mean annual air temperatures at Norman Wells and Ross River over the next 5 to 8 yr will be consistent with the changing trends of temperatures since 1980; this will result in a shortening of the winter season. The predicted precipitation at these 2 stations has the same trend, initially a slight decrease followed by an increase. Predictions for rainfall indicate no change at Ross River, but at Norman Wells an initially large decrease will be followed by an increase. Snowfall is predicted to increase greatly at Norman Wells over the next 8 yr. At Ross River, snowfall is predicted to increase after 1993.																			0936-577X					FEB 23	1995	5	1					1	13		10.3354/cr005001	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/cr005001													WOS:A1995RQ20800002
J	SCAVIA, D; LAIRD, GA				SCAVIA, D; LAIRD, GA			BACTERIOPLANKTON IN LAKE-MICHIGAN - DYNAMICS, CONTROLS, AND SIGNIFICANCE TO CARBON FLUX	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Lake Michigan [USA] bacterial production, based on [3H-methyl]thymidine (TdR) incorporation and empirically determined conversion factors (5-25 .times. 109 cells nmol-1), decreased with distance from shore (.apprx.2.times. over 30 km), was higher at night (1.4.times.-2.2.times.), and decreased with depth (.apprx. 10.times. over 100 m). TdR-based growth rates were consistent with independent antibiotic- and dilution-based estimates. Population size varied little and appeared controlled by balanced growth (0.02-0.33 h-1) and grazing (0.039-0.12 h-1). Growth correlated with temperature only below 10.degree.C. Cell size ranged from 0.015 to 0.072 .mu.m3. Carbon content averaged 0.154 .+-. 0.047 pg C .mu.m-3. Net annual carbon production was 142 g C m-2 yr-1. Summer averages were 28.9 (epilimmion), 10.4 (10-35 m), 1.6 (hypolimmion) .mu.g C liter-1 d-1, and 652 mg C m-2 d-1 for the water column. Flux to microconsumers averaged 8.4 .mu.g C liter-1 d-1 in the summer epilimmion. Annual areal bacterial carbon demand is met by autotrophic production only if little of the latter is lost by other means. This suggests that external loads are needed, our conversion factors are high, or autotrophic production is underestimated. Although only small adjustments of those factors will satisfy the annual balance, the summer imbalance is still too large. We suggest that temporal and spatial disequilibrium of labile organic carbon supply and bacterial use is reponsible for the apparent discrepancy during summer.

The monthly mean concentrations of total alkalinity, hardness, chloride, phosphate and nitrate of water were greatly increased during the drought affected second year compared with the first year. Prolonged summer in the region caused about 5 to 25 fold increase in chlorophyll a concentration of nannoplankton and net plankton, respectively. Phytoplankton peaks were less developed during the first year, whereas the summer peak was greatly enlarged during the drought affected second year. There was about two fold rise in the numbers of zooplankton during the second year as compared with the first year. Benthic invertebrates, on the other side, were reduced in numbers. Fish production was relatively less during the drought affected second year than during the first year.																			0003-9136					AUG	1993		4		90			507	532																WOS:A1993MJ82300004

C-13 analyses showed only three of the 88 test species to exhibit C-4 metabolism and only one of seven succulent species to be in CAM mode, Non-succulent winter ephemeral C-3 species showed significantly lower mean delta(13)C values (- 28.0 parts per thousand) than corresponding C-3-type herbaceous perennials, woody shrubs or trees (- 26.9, - 25.7 and - 26.2 parts per thousand, respectively), suggesting lower water stress and poorer water use efficiency in carbon acquisition by the former than latter groups of taxa, Corresponding values for delta(15)N of the above growth and life forms lay within the range 7.5-15.5 parts per thousand. delta(15)N of soil NH4+ (mean 19.6 parts per thousand) at a soft mulga site in Western Australia was considerably higher than that of NO3- (4.3 parts per thousand). Shoot dry matter of Acacia spp. exhibited mean delta(15)N values (9.10 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand) identical to those of 37 companion non-N-2-fixing woody shrubs and trees (9.06 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand). These data, with no evidence of nodulation, suggested little or no input of fixed N-2 by the legumes in question, However, two acacias and two papilionoid legumes from a dune of Hind-blown, heavily leached sand bordering a lake in mulga in Western Australia recorded delta(15)N values in the range 2.0-3.0 parts per thousand versus 6.4-10.7 parts per thousand for associated non-N-2-fixing taxa. These differences in delta(15)N and prolific nodulation of the legumes, indicated symbiotic inputs of tired N in this unusual situation. delta(15)N signals of lichens, termites, ants and grasshoppers from mulga of Western Australia provided evidence of N, fixation in certain termite colonies and by a cyanobacteria-containing species of lichen, Data are discussed in relation to earlier evidence of nitrophily and water availability constraints on nitrate utilization by mulga vegetation.

Functioning of natural and natural-engineering systems formation conditions and natural state of the hydrothermal system in the Valley of Geysers (Kronotsky Nature Reserve, Kamchatka)	WATER RESOURCES												The formation of the hydrothermal system in the Valley of Geysers is shown to be governed by a structure of radial and circular faults of above-intrusion zone of a partially melted magmatic body with an epicenter near the Upper-Geyser Field, while the hydrothermal system is shown to receive its water from elevations of +500 to +900 m abs (according to isotopic data). The catastrophic landslide of June 3, 2007, was just a stage in the general scenario of the gradual hydrothermal transformation of the inclined Geyser unit (Q (3) (4) grn), building up the roof of the hydrothermal reservoir, with a gradual decline of slide resistance. The slide was triggered by the increased pressure in the hydrothermal and magmatic systems and the saturation of the Geyser unit by moisture during spring flood. According to the data of continuous regime thermohydrodynamic observations carried out in the Valley of Geysers with the use of HOBO-loggers of temperature and pressure since July 2007 to April 2010, the mean time between eruptions of Velikan geyser was 348 minutes. The intensification of precipitation input directly into the geyser pool causes a short-time increase in the time between eruptions (up to the maximum of 32 h). According to observations at the "Plotina" gage, the total estimated mean annual discharge of thermal springs (by chlorine ion) in the Valley of Geysers is 263 kg/s; the discharge of thermal springs is governed by the level of Poldprudnoe Lake and its seasonal variations exceed 40%.					; Kiryukhin, Alexey/Q-3615-2016	Rychkova, Tatiana/0000-0002-6844-8771; Kiryukhin, Alexey/0000-0001-5468-1452													0097-8078					DEC	2012	39	7					722	736		10.1134/S0097807812070056	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0097807812070056													WOS:000312905800002

Changbai volcanic field, Northeastern China	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												The chemistry of groundwater is an important determinant of water quality, which is vital to human health and the ecosystem. It is estimated that 10% of the worldwide population lives in the vicinity of an active volcano; in these regions, the quality of the water could greatly affect crop yield and soil fertility. The Mt. Changbai volcanic field (CVF), located on the border between China and North Korea, is the most well-preserved typical forest ecosystem in eastern Asia, providing various ecological services to human beings. Many types of water bodies, including hot springs, cold springs, and surface water bodies (e.g. rivers and pools) are distributed in the volcanic field. In this study, the geochemical characteristics of these water types, the quality of the water for irrigation purposes, as well as the water quality-related natural mechanism of the water chemistry in the CVF were sys-tematically studied. The results indicate that the hydrochemical characteristics of the water samples in the CVF show the obvious difference between the volcanic cone and the peripheral areas. Significant spatial variation in the water quality was found in the CVF, where water in the peripheral areas was found to be of better water quality than that in the volcanic cone. The hot spring water in the CVF is not only unsuitable for drinking, but also unsuitable for irrigation. Water-rock interactions, ion exchange, and the addition of magmatic volatiles as well as atmospheric and anthropogenic sources are the main source and controlling factors of ions in the water in the CVF. The results of this study can be used as a reference for the sustainable management of groundwater resources in dormant volcanoes.

The technique has been applied for almost three decades. In this period the data quality has increased and the applications have evolved from the study of a few large lakes and rivers, to near global applications at various scales. Products from current satellite altimetry missions should be validated to continuously improve the measurements. Sentinel-3A has been operating since 2016 and is the first mission operating in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mode globally. Here we evaluate its performance in capturing lake level variations based on a physical and an empirical retracker provided in the official level 2 product. The validation is performed for more than 100 lakes in the United States and Canada where the altimetry based water levels are compared with in situ data. As validation measures we consider the root mean squared error, the Pearson correlation, and the percentage of outliers. For the US sites the median of the RMSE value is 25 cm and 19 cm and the median of the Pearson correlations are 0.86 and 0.93 for the physical and empirical retracker, respectively. The percentage of outliers (median) is 11% for both retrackers. The validations measures are slightly poorer for the Canadian sites; the median RMSE is approximately 5 cm larger, the Pearson correlation 0.1 lower, and the percentage of outliers 5% larger. The poorer performance for the Canadian sites is mainly related to the presence of lake ice in the winter period where the surface elevations are not able to map the surface correctly. The validation measures improve considerably when evaluated for summer data only. For both areas we show that the reconstruction of the water level variations based on the empirical retracker is significantly better compared to that of the physical retracker in terms of the RMSE and the Pearson correlation.					; Andersen, Ole Baltazar/H-7481-2016; Nielsen, Karina/L-9824-2017; Andersen, Ole/H-7481-2016	Ranndal, Heidi/0000-0002-0503-5048; Andersen, Ole Baltazar/0000-0002-6685-3415; Nielsen, Karina/0000-0002-0035-1869; 														2072-4292				SEP	2020	12	17							2835	10.3390/rs12172835	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12172835													WOS:000569632600001
J	RASK, M				RASK, M			THE DIET AND DIEL FEEDING-ACTIVITY OF PERCH, PERCA-FLUVIATILIS L IN A SMALL LAKE IN SOUTHERN FINLAND	ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI												Seasonal variations in the diet and diel feeding activity of perch were studied in a highly humic, small forest lake. Over the summer there was no clear change in the diet of perch of < 11 cm, whereas 11-13 cm fish fed on Asellus aquaticus and aquatic insect larvae in early summer but later concentrated on zooplankton. Perch of > 13 cm had a similar diet to fish of 11-13 cm during May-June, but later turned to corixids, water spiders and leeches. It appears that the intensity of predation by perch, the life histories of the prey species and decreasing oxygen conditions contributed to diet segregation and that a decreased availability of benthic food resulted in intraspecific competition. A shift occurred from distinct morning and evening activity peaks in May and June towards a midday peak in July and August. Temporal segregation in feeding activity was not observed among perch of different sizes.																			0003-455X	1797-2450					1986	23	1					49	56																WOS:A1986C552700004

Quantifying Summer Internal Phosphorus Loading in Large Lakes across the United States	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Internal phosphorus loading (IPL) can be a significant phosphorus (P) source in freshwater systems, often causing water-quality improvement delays. Despite its importance, IPL estimates are missing for many freshwater systems due to several large-scale measuring and modeling challenges. In this study, we develop a modeling framework to estimate summer anoxic sediment release rates (SRRs) for P in 5899 large lakes and reservoirs (surface area > 1.0 km(2); mixing depth < maximum depth) across the contiguous US (CONUS). Our framework combines random forest models for bottom-water temperature (BT) and surface-water total P (TP) with a mixed-effects regression model for SRR, and it includes uncertainty propagation across these models. Our results indicate that mean summer SRR ranges from 1 to 37 mg/m(2)/day across CONUS lakes, with 31% of waterbodies having SRR > 10 mg/m(2)/day. Areas of high SRR are generally associated with high predicted surface-water TP, which is particularly common in agricultural areas. Uncertainties in SRR predictions are largely attributable to the random forest-based inputs and predictive error in the SRR regression. In relatively dry summers, IPL is likely to be higher than external loading in 26% of watersheds. Overall, our results reveal where IPL can be a critical factor in watershed nutrient management.					; Borah, Smitom/CAH-0781-2022	Borah, Smitom Swapna/0000-0003-3083-6004; Nelson, Natalie/0000-0002-3258-7622													0013-936X	1520-5851				MAY 20	2025	59	21					10445	10454		10.1021/acs.est.4c13431	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c13431		MAY 2025						40391592					WOS:001492084900001

A combination of C-14 dated (AMS) terrestrial macrofossils and annually laminated sediments were used, together with diatom stratigraphy, to determine the age of the isolation from the Baltic Sea. The laminae were counted using greyscale analysis and studied in detail by thin sections. Three new pair of laminae were formed between 1993 and 1996, indicating that the laminae are annually formed as varves. This is further supported by studies of thin sections, which reveal organic and minerogenic layers reflecting summer algae bloom and spring flood, respectively. Two of the C-14 dated macrofossils are interpreted as redeposited wheras the calibrated ages received from two leaf fragments are believed to represent the age of sediment deposition. According to the varve counting, Lake Sagsjon (2.0 in a.s.l.) was isolated from the Baltic Sea between AD 1500 and 1600. The two radiocarbon dated leafs give an isolation age between AD 1150 and 1400. Compared to the C-14 dates, the laminae based chronology yields too young ages, which indicates that the deposition of the laminae was not continuous. Shortly after the isolation the rate of sediment accumulation increases, which most probably is an effect of increased erosion when the catchment area was partly brought under cultivation.

Population Structure and Genetic Divergence of Coastal Rainbow and Redband Trout in the Upper Klamath Basin	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Freshwater-resident coastal rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus and the anadromous form of the subspecies, coastal steelhead (summer and winter runs), are present throughout the lower Klamath River-Trinity River system. Although coastal steelhead and other anadromous salmonids historically migrated into the Upper Klamath Basin (which encompasses the upper Klamath River and Upper Klamath Lake) and associated tributaries, the construction of Copco Dam in 1918 and Iron Gate Dam in 1962 stopped all upstream migration of fish past these barriers. In the Upper Klamath Lake basin, native Upper Klamath Lake redband trout O. mykiss newberrii are found along with coastal rainbow trout that were trapped above the dams or stocked from hatchery sources. However, relatively little is known about the genetic relationships among the O. mykiss populations within the Upper Klamath Basin. A population genetic analysis based on data from 17 variable microsatellite loci was conducted for samples collected in the Upper Klamath Basin, including rainbow trout and Upper Klamath Lake redband trout (presumably representative of the ancestral coastal and inland lineages) as well as samples of O. mykiss from neighboring inland lake basins. In addition, the Upper Klamath Basin samples were compared with data from O. mykiss populations below Iron Gate Dam. Results demonstrate the presence of distinct inland and coastal genetic lineages as well as divergent lineages represented by samples from the inland lake basins; these results have significant implications for future restoration of O. mykiss in the greater Klamath River-Trinity River system.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAY	2011	140	3					587	597		10.1080/00028487.2011.583538	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2011.583538													WOS:000291813800007
J	Fast, JD; Heilman, WE				Fast, JD; Heilman, WE			Simulated sensitivity of seasonal ozone exposure in the Great Lakes region to changes in anthropogenic emissions in the presence of interannual variability	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												A coupled meteorological and chemical modeling system with a 12-km horizontal grid spacing was used to simulate the evolution of ozone over the Great Lakes region between May and September of 1999 and 2001. The overall temporal and spatial variations in hourly ozone concentrations and ozone exposure from control simulations agreed reasonably well with the observations at most locations with an overall monthly bias computed across all stations ranging from -3.2 to 5.3 ppb, the root mean square difference ranging from 18.2 to 22.2 ppb, and an index of agreement ranging from 0.63 to 0.78. As with the observations, the simulated ozone exposure was higher during most months of the summer of 1999 than during 2001. Sensitivity simulations that increased anthropogenic trace gas emissions were performed to determine the changes in ozone exposure in the presence of meteorological interannual variability. The emission scenario simulations that employed the meteorological conditions of 1999 and increased anthropogenic emissions of NOx and VOCs produced increases in ozone exceeding 80 ppb over the lower peninsula of Michigan, the eastern half of the upper peninsula of Michigan, and over Ontario just north of Lake Superior and Lake Huron. Over the agricultural regions, more ozone between 60 and 80 ppb was produced. The cooler and wetter conditions with more frequent periods of northwesterly flow during the summer of 2001 were not as favorable for ozone production and did not result in increased ozone, despite the increase in anthropogenic emissions. Increases in ozone exceeding 60 ppb occurred only over the lake surfaces and in central Michigan when the meteorological conditions of the summer of 2001 were applied. For both summers, increases in anthropogenic emissions decreased ozone exposure in the immediate vicinity of the largest metropolitan areas. Since anthropogenic emission rate projections depend on assumptions of population, economic development, land-use patterns, and technology, the effect of anthropogenic emission rates on the magnitude and regional-scale distribution of ozone concentrations could be much larger or smaller than indicated by this study. In a subsequent study, the simulated ozone will be used as input to biological models to assess the response of ozone-sensitive tree species in the Great Lakes region to ozone levels produced by various anthropogenic emission scenarios.

Variation and Controls of Sediment Oxygen Demand in Backwater Lakes of the Upper Mississippi River During Winter	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Many ecological processes affect the availability of winter dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in rivers, a key feature of overwintering fish habitat. Sediment oxygen demand (SOD) contributes to DO depletion, particularly during ice-covered periods, and may cause hypoxic conditions in backwater lakes, affecting the availability of suitable overwintering habitat. Understanding the drivers of SOD on habitat conditions during winter is critical for the management of the Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS). We measured SOD rates in three different habitat types (shallow, non-vegetated; deep, non-vegetated; and vegetated) within 12 backwater lakes in Pools 4, Pool 8, and Pool 13 of the UMRS in January and February 2022. Sediment physicochemical characteristics were measured to identify potential drivers of winter SOD rates. Measured SOD rates ranged from 0.04-0.44 g O-2/(m(2)d) at in situ temperatures, and 0.14-1.46 g O-2/(m(2)d) when corrected to 20 degrees C. There were no statistically significant relations between in situ SOD and most sediment characteristics. SOD was positively associated with aquatic vegetation presence and negatively associated with sediment pH, water depth, flow velocity, and ice depth. SOD was typically higher at vegetated sites with lower flow velocity, with four of the five highest SOD rates measured at vegetated sites. Vegetation presence, depth, and flow velocity played greater roles in controlling SOD rates than sediment characteristics. Additionally, DO concentrations near the sediment-water interface at deep sites (> 1.5 m) were much lower than DO concentrations 0.2 m under the water surface, indicating that SOD was influencing DO concentrations and may be affecting overwintering habitat in backwater lakes.																			1535-1459	1535-1467				2025 SEP 17	2025										10.1002/rra.70011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.70011		SEP 2025											WOS:001573934800001

Variability of the structure of winter microbial communities in Chelyabinsk lakes	BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY												Microorganisms form complex and dynamic communities that play a key role in the biogeochemical cycles of lakes. A high level of urbanization is currently a serious threat to bacterial communities and the ecosystem of freshwater bodies. To assess the contribution of anthropogenic load to variations in the structure of winter microbial communities in lakes, microorganisms of four water bodies of Chelyabinsk region were studied for the first time. We used cultural, chromatography-mass spectrometric, and modern methods of statistical data processing (particularly, multivariate exploratory analysis and canonical analysis of correspondences). The research showed that the composition of winter microbial communities in lakes Chebarkul', Smolino, Pervoye, and Shershenevskoye Reservoir did not differ significantly between the main phyla of microorganisms. The dominant microorganisms were found to be of the Firmicutes phylum and Actinobacteria phylum. The structure of bacterial communities had special features depending on the characteristics of the water body and the sampling depths. Thus, in the lakes Smolino, Pervoye, and Shershenevskoye Reservoir, an important role was played by associations between microorganisms - indicators of fecal contamination: coliform bacteria and Enterococcus. On the contrary, in Chebarkul' Lake, members of the genus Bacillus, which are natural bioremediators, formed stable winter associations. However, the differences between water bodies and sampling depths reflected 28.1% and 9.8% of the variability of the winter microbial communities, respectively. The largest contribution (about 60%) to the variability of the structure was made by intra-water processes, which determined the high heterogeneity of samples from different water areas. We assume that an important role in this variability was played by the high anthropogenic impact in a large industrial metropolis. In our opinion, this line of research is very promising for addressing key environmental issues.

In this study, we obtained a 530-cm-long peat core from the Ganchi wetland in Southwest China and analyzed its geochemical indices, including total nitrogen (TN), total organic carbon (TOC), stable carbon isotope composition of organics (delta(13)Corg), and the concentration of several major elements, to investigate the sedimentary and hydroclimate evolution since the LGM. We found that the peat strata in the Ganchi wetland have developed gradually from 13.7 cal kyr BP, which is likely ascribed to the warm climate during the Bolling-Allerod (B/A) period. TOC, delta(13)Corg, K/Ti, and Fe/Mn records showed notable paleoclimate shifts since the last deglaciation. The first warming period after the LGM was observed starting at 18.2 cal kyr BP, which is consistent with other records from Southwest China. The reconstruction results show that the western margin of the Sichuan Basin during the last deglaciation was most affected by the East Asia summer monsoon (EASM), and less affected by the Indian summer monsoon (ISM). The climate of the early Holocene (11.2-7.5 cal kyr BP) was affected by both the ISM and EASM, resulting in more complex local climatic features. The Holocene Megathermal period observed from 7.5 to 3.5 cal kyr BP, is consistent with the timing detected in other records of Southwest China.

D. 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajokull in Iceland caused severe disruption to air travel across Europe, but as a geological event it is not unprecedented. Analysis of peats and lake sediments from northern Europe has revealed the presence of microscopic layers of Icelandic volcanic ash (tephra). These sedimentary records, together with historical records of Holocene ash falls, demonstrate that Icelandic volcanoes have generated substantial ash clouds that reached northern Europe many times. Here we present the first comprehensive compilation of sedimentary and historical records of ash-fall events in northern Europe, spanning the past 7000 yr. Ash-fall events appear to have been more frequent in the past 1500 yr. It is unclear whether this reflects a true increase in eruption frequency or dispersal, or is an artifact of the records or the way in which they have been generated. In the past 1000 yr, volcanic ash clouds reached northern Europe with a mean return interval of 56 +/- 9 yr (the range of return intervals is between 6 and 115 yr). Probabilistic modeling using the ash records for the last millennium indicates that for any 10 yr period there is a 16% probability of a tephra fallout event in northern Europe. These values must be considered as conservative estimates due to the nature of tephra capture and preservation in the sedimentary record.

Role of advection in atmospheric ammonia: A case study at a Japanese lake basin influenced by agricultural ammonia sources	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												The dry and wet depositions of atmospheric ammonia (NH3) is one of the important pathways of nitrogen loads to aquatic ecosystems and should be managed to mitigate lake eutrophication. Crop and livestock agriculture, one of the largest emitters of NH3 in Asian countries, are known to cause high spatial and seasonal variation of NH3 and influence the surrounding lake basin areas via its dry and wet deposition. However, the spatial characteristics of the NH3 concentration in basin scale are not completely understood for regulation in NH3 emission because a paucity of monitoring network is currently available for NH3 in many Asian countries. Here we aim to clarify dominant factors of spatial and seasonal variations of the NH3 concentration in a shallow eutrophic lake basin (Lake Kasumigaura basin) surrounded by agricultural areas in eastern Japan. Passive sampling over various land use categories in the basin was conducted at 36 sites in total from October 10, 2018 to January 14, 2020. Mean NH3 concentration in the observational period was in the order of farmland (6.6 ppbv), lake (5.9 ppbv), rural (3.5 ppbv), and forest (2.6 ppbv). Interestingly, the observed NH3 concentration near the livestock houses were higher in winter than summer, which was inconsistent with knowledge of seasonal changes of current NH3 emission inventory based on temperature-driven volatilization process. Comparing monthly NH3 concentrations at farmland and lake sites with various meteorological factors, we suggested the importance of seasonal advection of NH3 from high emission sources to which has been rarely paid attention by the previous past studies. Consequently, a higher nitrogen input by dry deposition of NH3 was preliminarily estimated over the lake than that of wet deposition of total nitrogen. Our finding of a role of seasonal advection in NH3 spatial pattens should be considered for lake ecosystem management since its deposition is known to be closely related to the ecological processes such as phytoplankton blooming.					陽平, 沼田/IVV-0650-2023; Fukushima, Keitaro/J-9598-2017; igarashi, yasuhito/AAW-3443-2020; Imamura, Naohiro/KIB-9981-2024	Watanabe, Mirai/0000-0002-2132-7032; Ouchi, Takao/0000-0001-8807-1572; Fukushima, Keitaro/0000-0001-5968-5938; 													1352-2310	1873-2844				DEC 15	2020	243								117856	10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.117856	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.117856													WOS:000587335700012
J	O'Loughlin, EJ; Chin, YP				O'Loughlin, EJ; Chin, YP			Quantification and characterization of dissolved organic carbon and iron in sedimentary porewater from Green Bay, WI, USA	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Both dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and iron play an important role in biogeochemical processes in lacustrine benthic environments. Moreover, recent evidence has shown that both substances can act as active reductants in the redox transformation of organic pollutants. This paper examines the nature and abundance of DOC and dissolved ferrous iron (Fell) in porewaters from a sediment core collected in Green Bay, W1, USA. The concentration of dissolved Fell and the abundance, absorbance at 280 nm (A(280) (nm)), molar absorptivities (epsilon(280 nm)) molecular weights, and polydispersities of DOC were measured as a function of depth in porewaters. Dissolved Fell concentrations increased from 3.6 muM near the sediment-water interface to 163 muM at a depth of 11 cm, then gradually declined. The DOC distribution varied with sediment depth, with the greatest variation in porewater DOC content and properties occurring in the transitional zone between oxic and suboxic conditions. The down-core porewater DOC profile was characterized by an increase in DOC concentration with depth from 0.64 mM OC at 1 cm to 1.23 mM OC at 13 cm, below which it remained relatively constant. A strong correlation was observed between Fell and DOC concentrations, Suggesting that these constituents co-accumulate in these porewaters. The correlation between the DOC concentration of the porewaters and A(280 nm) was significant, making this parameter a good predictor for DOC concentrations in these waters. The molecular weight distributions of the porewater DOC were primarily monomodal, with relatively low polydispersivities. Weight-average molecular weights ranged from 1505 to 1949 Da. This data set is unique in that it is the first detailed study of a relatively highly resolved DOC profile of benthic porewater in surficial sediment from the Laurentian Great Lakes.

Three-dimensional modeling of sediment resuspension in a large shallow lake	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We simulated bottom resuspension events in Lake Erie, using a coupled three-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model. Key parameters in the model, including critical bottom shear stress (tau(cr)) and resuspension rate (alpha) were calibrated and validated by comparing the model output to observations. These included total suspended solid (TSS) concentrations in the bottom boundary layer (RMSE = 0.74 mg L-1) and water column (RMSE = 0.81 mg L-1), and to time series of acoustic backscatter signal (R-2 > 0.8) and turbidity (R-2 approximate to 0.4) from long-term moorings near the lakebed in 2008-09 and 2013. Signals from phytoplankton, in spring and summer, caused discrepancies between modeled TSS and the observed turbidity data. Although common practice, we show that literature-based or field-observed critical shear stress should not be directly applied in large-scale Reynolds-averaged sediment model as this will likely underestimate resuspension. In agreement with the literature, the model reproduced more frequent and intensive surface-wave driven resuspension in the shallow regions (< similar to 20 m), particularly in the western basin, compared to the deeper central and eastern basins, where bottom stresses induced by mean currents (tau(c)) were comparable with those due to surface waves (tau(w)). However, on the northshore of the eastern basin, tau(c) often predominated over tau(w). We simulated thermocline motion, including up- and down-welling events and swashing of the internal Poincare wave, to contribute to tau(c) in the central basin and form nepheloid layers.

S. summer drought during the period 1895 - 1995. The analysis identifies statistically significant patterns of spatiotemporal variability on interannual and bidecadal timescales indicative of both cold- season and warm- season atmospheric influences on North American drought patterns. The most robust signal found appears to be associated with the influences of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation ( ENSO) on North American summer drought. Evidence is also found to support the existence of a roughly bidecadal drought signal tied to warm- season atmospheric circulation changes. The "Dust Bowl'' conditions of the 1930s appear to result from a combination of these bidecadal influences on drought conditions that coincide with a decrease in the amplitude of interannual ENSO- related variability during the 1930s.

In this comment, we present strong evidence for the presence of subaquatic springs in the lake that maintain the chemoclines at their present levels. Furthermore, the observed changes in the stratification do not call for urgent action. We therefore strongly advise against the proposed measures, which would most probably be harmful for the ecosystem, and instead propose to further monitor the development of the stratification in the lake.

The Imbrie/Kipp and multiple stepwise linear regression models are used to show the statistical association between percentages of 19 pollen taxa and climatic variables (Jan. June, July and summer temperatures, Young''s index of summer warmth and summer [JJA] precipitation). Multiple correlation coefficients are high and standard deviations of temperature estimates are less than .+-. 1.degree. C and 2.5 cm. The problem of the local variability of pollen in surface mosses is considered through an analysis of the results of the transfer functions on 69 additional modern surface samples from around Fort Chimo, Frobisher Bay, Pangnirtung, Broughton Island and Clyde River. Good agreement exists between the predicted July temperatures based on the transfer functions and adjacent weather station records. The transfer functions are applied to 4 fossil peat pollen sequences on Cumberland Peninsula. These spectra provide a nearly continuous record that covers the last 6000 yr. Analysis of the fossil materials provides estimates of July T.degree. C and summer precipitation (cm). A period of warmer and wetter conditions generally prevailed between 6000 and 4000 BP although this climate was punctuated by cooler conditions circa 4800 yr ago. Over the last 3600 yr the pollen record from Windy Lake shows a progressive decline in July temperature. Superimposed on this trend are a number of temperature oscillations which show correspondence with other regional proxy climatic records.																			0004-0851						1980	12	1					41	64		10.2307/1550589	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1550589													WOS:A1980JH45800005

An inference model for mean summer air temperatures in the Southern Alps, New Zealand, using subfossil chironomids	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Quantitative paleoclimate reconstructions from Southern Hemisphere mid-latitude sites are critical for identifying spatial and temporal patterns of abrupt climate change and for testing hypotheses about possible causal mechanisms. The analysis of chironomid distributions and environmental variables from 61 lakes was undertaken to develop a robust inference model for quantitative temperature reconstruction from sites in South Island, New Zealand. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated that mean summer air temperature (SmT), chlorophyll a, conductivity, organic content of sediment as determined by loss-on-ignition, and mean annual precipitation account for a significant portion of variance in chironomid taxa distribution. SmT was the dominant variable. The strongest performing inference model, based on weighted averaging-partial least squares (WA-PLS), was developed from 60 lakes for SmT, having a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEPjack) of 1.27 degrees C and a coefficient of determination of 0.80 (r(jack)(2)). These results confirm that New Zealand chironomids may be used to provide robust estimates of mean summer air temperature and are a reliable method for quantitative paleoenvironmental reconstruction.

Hydrological connectivity (the percent of river channel water interacting with floodplain wetlands), water age (the time elapsed since water entered the system via the main river channel) and water temperature have strong impacts on the biogeochemical processes controlling the fate of sediment and nutrients at continental margins. A Delft3D hydrodynamic model was used to explore the role of river and tide forcings, hydrogeomorphology, and vegetation roughness on hydrological connectivity, water age, and water temperature of a young, prograding river delta in coastal Louisiana, Wax Lake Delta. Across a simulation period of January to June 2015, an average of 39.9% of river flow entered the delta floodplains and water within the floodplains had an average water age of 0.8 days. In winter and spring, floodplain zones with higher sediment surface elevations (supratidal hydrogeomorphic zones) were characterized by increased water age and warmer water temperatures compared to subtidal floodplains and channels. Our experimental models indicate that the presence of wetland vegetation decreases hydrological connectivity by preventing flow of water into deltaic floodplain, but increases water age by retaining water within the floodplains. Despite small amplitudes (-30 cm), tides create hourly exchange between channels and floodplains, which decreases water age in floodplains, but has little impact on average connectivity. Our results emphasize the role of both hydrological forcings (river and tides) and ecosystem features (vegetation and sediment surface elevation) in regulating channel-floodplain interactions in deltaic systems. Evaluated against field data, which is often difficult to collect at high spatial and temporal frequency in floodplains, this model performs well, highlighting the utility of numerical models in capturing landscape-scale hydrodynamics.

Origin of water in the Badain Jaran Desert, China: new insight from isotopes	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												To better understand the origin of water in the Badain Jaran Desert, China, water samples were collected from lakes, a spring and local unconfined aquifer for analyses of radiocarbon (C-14), tritium (H-3), stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios (delta H-2 - delta O-18), and d-excess values (=delta H-2 -8 delta O-18). A series of evaporation experiments were also conducted in the desert to examine how the isotopic signature of water may change during evaporation and infiltration under local environmental conditions. The results show that the lakes in the southeastern sand dune area are fed by groundwater discharging into the lakes and that local groundwater, on the other hand, is derived primarily from modern meteoric precipitation in the region. Although dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in groundwater yielded very old radiocarbon ages, the presence of detectable amounts of tritium in groundwater samples, together with their delta H-2, delta O-18 and d-excess characteristics, strongly suggests that the old radiocarbon ages of DIC do not represent the residence time of water in the aquifer but are the result of addition of old DIC derived from dissolution of ancient carbonates in the aquifer. The data do not support the hypothesis that the water in the Badain Jaran Desert was sourced in remote mountains on the northern Tibetan Plateau. This study also finds no support for the hypothesis that present-day water resources in the desert were recharged by the precipitation that fell in the past during the early Holocene when the climate was much wetter than today. Instead, this study shows that both groundwater and lake water originated from meteoric precipitation in the region including mountainous areas adjacent to the desert under the modern climatic condition.					; wang, shuqing/JRX-7812-2023	Wang, Xu-Sheng/0000-0001-8736-2378; wu, xiujie/0000-0003-4106-664X													1027-5606	1607-7938				SEP 7	2017	21	9					4419	4431		10.5194/hess-21-4419-2017	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-4419-2017													WOS:000409473300004

Reconstructions are based on pollen, diatoms, sediment chemistry and isotopes, packrat middens and glacial records and are discussed within the context of Central Mexico, the Yucatan and Northern Mexico, the three regions for which significant information is available. The available data indicate that over the Late Pleistocene and Holocene there have been significant climatic changes in Mexico, although smaller in magnitude than in other parts of the northern hemisphere tropics and subtropics. Maps of conditions at 18,000, 9000, 6000, 5000 and 1000 yr BP are presented. These show that northern Mexico and the Yucatan often show opposite climatic signals, whilst the highlands of central Mexico are more variable. Around the Last Glacial Maximum it seems that the modern summer precipitation regime had collapsed. Northern Mexico, however, was much wetter than today due to increased winter rainfall. Modern rainfall patterns were not fully established until after 9000 yr BP and generally wet conditions prevailed about 6000 yr BP. The mid-Holocene seems to have been a period of great climatic variability with a number of records showing oscillations between 6000 and 5000 yr BP. A period of marked aridity is recorded in the Yucatan and central Mexico about 1000 yr BP. More well-dated, continuous records are needed, especially covering the last glacial-interglacial transition. The changing balance between temperate and tropical climate systems and the influence of the Pacific compared with the Gulf of Mexico/Caribbean warrant further investigation.

The morphologically complex taxon Cyclotella comensis Grunow had no clear relationship with environmental parameters in a study using sediment surface samples from the Swiss Alps. The morphological heterogeneity of the taxon was investigated by applying a principal component analysis (PCA) to 9000 presence/absence descriptions of valves from surface samples of six lakes from different altitudes (15 characteristics, 100 valves each lake). The PCA allowed the classification of six morphs, which differed mainly in size and length of striae. Photographs of the morphs are shown in this paper. 2. Sixty-eight sediment surface samples were analysed using these newly defined six morphs. Summer temperature explained a major part of the variance between the morphs as assessed by a redundancy analysis (RDA). Summer temperature optima and tolerances were estimated using weighted averaging. 3. The influence of the revised C, comensis taxonomy on the diatom inferred summer temperature of a high alpine lake is discussed in a multiproxy context for the past 800 years.

J	Cao, YS; Tian, YH; Yin, B; Zhu, ZL				Cao, Yansheng; Tian, Yuhua; Yin, Bin; Zhu, Zhaoliang			Improving agronomic practices to reduce nitrate leaching from the rice-wheat rotation system	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Winter wheat-summer rice rotation with unique dry-wet cycle water regime is one of the most general cropping systems in the Yangtze Delta, which might favor NO3--N leaching into shallow groundwater due to high fertilizer-N input with low N use efficiency. To alleviate the detrimental impacts caused by N leaching, it is necessary to apply improved management practices. Therefore, the objectives of the present study are to investigate characteristics of N leaching under drained upland crop-flooded rice rotation and illustrate the effectiveness of an improved agronomic practice for mitigating NO3--N leaching. N leaching measured in situ for the control (CK), conventional (CT), and improved (IT) treatments for one rice-wheat rotation. Improved fertilization and crop cultivation managements have been applied to the IT treatment in an integrated manner, including low N fertilization rate, high fertilization frequency, and dense planting. During the rice-growing season, NO3--N and dissolved organic N (DON) were the predominant forms of N in percolation water, and contributed over 25% and 59% to TN, respectively. NO3--N and TN concentrations in percolation water and leaching losses did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) between treatments. N leaching occurred mainly during the early stage of rice seedling transplanting. During the wheat-growing season, N in percolation water was predominantly in the form of NO3--N, and accounted for over 64.5-82.9% of TN. N fertilization significantly increased NO3--N and TN concentrations in percolation water. Nitrate and TN leaching losses from the IT treatment (1.15 and 1.38 kg N ha(-1), respectively) were smaller than the CT treatment (1.34 and 1.76 kg N ha(-1), respectively). The majority of N leaching losses for wheat occurred during the period from late February to final harvest. The IT treatment exhibited no significant effect on wheat yield, but significantly (p < 0.05) increased rice yield (8.60 Mg ha(-1) compared to 8.06 Mg ha(-1)) relative to the CT treatment. Compared with the conventional management practice, the improved management practice appeared to be effective in reducing N leaching and increasing grain yield under the rice-wheat rotation.

Vegetation and climate history reconstructed from an alpine lake in central Tienshan Mountains since 8.5 ka BP	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												High mountains are humid islands in arid central Asia, and alpine vegetation is sensitive to climate change, especially to temperature variations. Here we present a palynological sequence and discuss the past vegetation and climate changes based on core BY10A from the Swan Lake, an alpine lake situated at an inter-montane basin in the central Tienshan Mountains, Xinjiang, northwestern China. We collected 52 modern pollen surface samples at different elevations to aid in the interpretation of fossil-pollen data, which provide a reconstruction of vegetation and climate history for the last 8.5 ka (1 ka = 1000 cal yr BP). Artemisia and Amaranthaceae (= Chenopodiaceae) are the main pollen types in desert steppe zone below 1800 m elevation, while Poaceae and Picea dominate the mid-elevation forest steppe zone (1800-2800 m). Cyperaceae is the main indicator of high alpine meadows (>2800 m). From 8.5 to 6.9 ka, the vegetation was steppe meadow suggesting relatively warm climate. From 6.9 to 2.6 ka generally high values of Cyperaceae and peaty sediments indicate a fen environment and cooler, more humid conditions. Interrupting this mid-Holocene period is a 5.5-4.5 ka millennium of lacustrine sediments with lower Cyperaceae, higher Poaceae and Artemisia, and high values of Myriophyllum and Pediastrum indicating higher water levels and warmer temperatures. After 2.6 ka, pollen data indicate alpine steppe and warmer climate. The mid-Holocene pattern of cooler climate interrupted by a warmer period is consistent from other regional records from Xinjiang, including the Guliya ice core and Kesang Cave speleothem record. During the cooler periods, the regional record indicates that a weakened summer Asian monsoon is countered to some extent by a stronger winter monsoon. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Jin, KR; Ji, ZG; James, RT				Jin, Kang-Ren; Ji, Zhen-Gang; James, R. Thomas			Three-dimensional water quality and SAV modeling of a large shallow lake	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												This study presents the Lake Okeechobee Environment Model (LOEM), a three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic, sediment, water quality, and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) model of Lake Okeechobee, Florida. The LOEM is developed under the framework of the EFDC model (Hamrick 1992). Lake Okeechobee is the largest subtropical lake in North America (1, 730 km(2)), it is very shallow (mean depth 2.7 m), and it includes a littoral habitat that makes up 20% of its area. The LOEM is calibrated, verified, and validated to 3 years of water quality and SAV data. The water quality results are consistent with observed data from 25 locations in the take. The model is capable of reproducing key water quality characteristics of the lake without having to resort to extensive, site-specific parameter manipulations. The SAV model is calibrated using measured SAV data in the lake. The SAV model is capable of representing the spatial and temporal variations of SAV variations in the lake well. The LOEM is applied to study water quality and SAV processes in the lake. The model results are consistent with observed data indicating that algal growth in the lake is primarily nitrogen limited in the summer and nitrogen and light co-limited in the winter. Lower water elevation generally leads to larger SAV area. SAV can have positive impact on the lake water quality by reducing algae concentration. The calibrated verified, and validated LOEM model serves as a useful tool to support lake management.																			0380-1330					MAR	2007	33	1					28	45		10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[28:TWQASM]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[28:TWQASM]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000245692400004

With the accumulation of proxy records, however, both the nature of the 4.2 ka event itself and the manner of societal responses to climate change have become controversial. Here we present a climatic record of Daihai Lake spanning 5-3 cal ka BP, together with a cultural series for the lake basin around 4 cal ka BP, to explore the regional nature of the 4.2 ka event and the relationship between climatic variation and cultural evolution. The climatic record reflects a dry event at the interval of 4060-3690 cal yr BP that could be a regional manifestation of the 4.2 ka event. The cultural series suggests an interruption between two different cultures during the period of 4300-4000 cal yr BP. Taking into consideration the dating errors and especially the uncertainties resulting from dating cultural layers of the archaeological sections, we suggest that the cultural interruption in the Daihai Lake basin might have been caused by a monsoon-related dry event. Humans primarily engaged in agriculture likely left the lake basin because the drainage basin became unsuitable for agrarian activities as the climate became too dry, thus leaving a cultural vacancy of several centuries in the lake basin. A significant decline in the intensity of the East Asian summer monsoon on centennial to multi-decadal timescales could be associated with dramatic cooling of surface waters of both the North Atlantic and western tropical Pacific.

J	Mitikka, S; Ekholm, P				Mitikka, S; Ekholm, P			Lakes in the Finnish Eurowaternet: status and trends	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT					Detecting Environmental Change - Science and Society Conference	JUL 16-20, 2001	UNIV LONDON, SENATE HOUSE, LONDON, ENGLAND		UNIV LONDON, SENATE HOUSE			The Eurowaternet is a monitoring network designed to cover all European countries, with the overall objective of obtaining timely, quantitative and comparative information on the status of inland waters so that their key environmental problems can be defined, quantified and monitored. Finland launched the Eurowaternet for lakes in 2000. The network was set up according to guidelines of the European Environment Agency (EEA) and was based on national, regional and local monitoring programmes. It includes 253 lake sites, divided into the following groups by, for example, their loading background and size: (i) reference sites, (ii) point-source loading (impact) sites, (iii) agricultural sites, (iv) representative sites, i.e. lakes < 100 km(2) with typical water quality in the catchment and (v) lake deep sites in large lakes (> 100 km(2)). We examined the water quality and its development during 1976-2001 in these groups, using data from surface and near-bottom water layers at summer and winter stagnation. In addition, the representativeness of the network was evaluated. Summer mean concentrations of total P (TP) during 1990-2001 in surface water were (i) 6.8+/-1.8 mug l(-1) in reference lakes, (ii) 24+/-5 mug l(-1) in lakes affected by point loading, (iii) 58+/-32 mug l(-1) in agricultural lakes, (iv) 14+/-2.2 mug l(-1) in representative lakes and (v) 11+/-2.1 mug l(-1) in large lakes. Comparison with reference lakes revealed major impact of human activities on TP and total N (TN)-and consequently on chlorophyll a (a-chl) and transparency-in all other groups, especially agricultural lakes. Decreasing TP and increasing O-2 trends were found at impact sites, reflecting water protection measures taken in pulp and paper mills and municipalities. More surprisingly, we found. increasing alkalinity trends in all but agricultural sites and decreasing NO2-N+NO3-N (NOx-N) trends particularly in pelagic areas of large lakes. Comparison of water quality in Eurowaternet lakes with those in randomly sampled lakes (Finnish Lake Survey) revealed that the Eurowaternet covers the entire range of concentrations of TP, TN and conductivity in Finnish lakes, but < 1-km(2), eutrophic and/or brown water lakes are underrepresented. Only 0.2% of a total of 13 114 small lakes (0.1-1 km(2)) are included in the annual monitoring program of the Eurowaternet. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All-rights reserved.

Spawning Habitat Unsuitability: An Impediment to Cisco Rehabilitation in Lake Michigan?	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The cisco Coregonus artedi was one of the most important native prey fishes in Lake Michigan and in the other four Laurentian Great Lakes. Most of the cisco spawning in Lake Michigan was believed to have occurred in Green Bay. The cisco population in Lake Michigan collapsed during the 1950s, and the collapse was attributed in part to habitat degradation within Green Bay. Winter water quality surveys of lower Green Bay during the 1950s and 1960s indicated that the bottom dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration was less than 2 mg/L throughout much of the lower bay, and most cisco eggs would not successfully hatch at such low DO concentrations. To determine present-day spawning habitat suitability in lower Green Bay, we compared cisco egg survival in lower Green Bay with survival at a reference site (St. Marys River, Michigan-Ontario) during 2009. We also conducted winter water quality surveys in lower Green Bay and the St. Marys River during 2009 and 2010. Cisco egg survival in lower Green Bay averaged 65.3%, which was remarkably similar to and not significantly different from the mean at the St. Marys River site (64.0%). Moreover, the lowest bottom DO concentrations recorded during the winter surveys were 11.2 mg/L in lower Green Bay and 12.7 mg/L in the St. Marys River. These relatively high DO concentrations would not be expected to have any negative effect on cisco egg survival. We conclude that winter water quality conditions in lower Green Bay were suitable for successful hatching of cisco eggs and that water quality during the egg incubation period did not represent an impediment to cisco rehabilitation in Lake Michigan. Our approach to determining spawning habitat suitability for coregonids would be applicable to other aquatic systems.																			0275-5947						2011	31	5					905	913		10.1080/02755947.2011.632065	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2011.632065													WOS:000296983500011

Feeding ecology of Limnocalanus macrurus in the Laurentian Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH					Joint Conference of the European Large Lakes Symposium (ELLS) / Conference of the International-Association-for-Great-Lakes-Research (IAGLR) - Big Lakes - Small World	2019	Univ Savoie Mont Blanc, Alpine Ctr Res Troph Networks & Limn Ecosystems, Evian, FRANCE	French Natl Res Inst Agr Food & Ennvironm, Int Assoc Great Lakes Res	Univ Savoie Mont Blanc, Alpine Ctr Res Troph Networks & Limn Ecosystems			The zooplankton communities of several Laurentian Great Lakes have shifted toward greater biomass of calanoid copepods, particularly Limnocalanus macrurus, since the 1990s. Limnocalanus is an omnivore that feeds on large phytoplankton cells, ciliates, rotifers, and small crustacean zooplankton, especially copepod nauplii, and it may be an increasingly important zooplanktivore in these systems. Although there is previous research examining Limnocalanus predation rates on nauplii, we do not know if the presence of phytoplankton affects predation rates. Our initial experiments confirmed Limnocalanus preference for nauplii over small copepodites. Additional experiments showed that Limnocalanus feeding rates on nauplii decreased by 50% at the highest phytoplankton concentrations tested. Limnocalanus fed more on the larger algae tested (Cryptomonas, Cryptophyta, 40 mu m) than on the smaller taxa (Scenedesmus, Chlorophyta, 10 mu m). We used stable isotope analysis to infer Limnocalanus trophic position in the five Laurentian Great Lakes by comparing Limnocalanus with simultaneously captured Leptodiaptomus sicilis, another calanoid copepod known to feed on phytoplankton and microzooplankton. This analysis showed Limnocalanus at higher trophic positions in the more oligotrophic lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior than in lakes Ontario and Erie. Summer Limnocalanus trophic position was inversely related to both the site-specific concentration of algae in the deep chlorophyll layer and a trophic state index based on spring chlorophyll and total phosphorus. Our results indicate that predation by Limnocalanus on zooplankton depends on lake algal abundance, and that feeding rates on nauplii by an individual Limnocalanus adult are likely higher in the more oligotrophic lakes.

The relative contributions of autochthonous and allochthonous production sources that support high stocks of secondary consumers are undetermined in this river. We used excitation-emission fluorescence spectroscopy and absorption spectra of dissolved organic matter to infer degradation of leaf material originating from the surrounding gallery forest. During the low-water period, a large fraction of fluorescent organic matter contained in leaves degraded quickly in river water and was an important allochthonous contribution of C to the system. However, the fluorescence signature of dissolved organic matter in lagoons was different from that of the main river channel during the falling-water period, suggesting that other sources of C were present. Allochthonous organic matter clearly fueled microbial respiration during the falling-water period, but our in-water experiments using light-dark bottle methods indicated that autochthonous production was an important supplementary C source in shallow nearshore waters. During the low-water and falling-water periods, water-column primary production in nearshore waters ranged from 150 to 500 mg C m(-2) d(-1) and was 2x greater than community respiration, i.e., the nearshore component of the water column was net autotrophic. Benthic primary production in nearshore areas where light reached the sediments ranged between 350 and 500 mg C m(-2) d-' and was about equal to community respiration. Primary production was probably limited by the availability of dissolved inorganic N, which sometimes was below detection limits of similar to 0.5 mu M (mean similar to 0.25 mu M). Our results support the idea that autotrophic production is an important C source in neotropical rivers.					; Cotner, James/D-8799-2013; Roelke, Daniel/B-5766-2008; Del Castillo, Carlos/N-2601-2013; Montoya, Jose/A-6775-2008	Roelke, Daniel/0000-0002-3166-3793; Cotner, James/0000-0001-9792-467X; Winemiller, Kirk/0000-0003-0236-5129; Montoya, Jose V./0000-0002-9759-4946; 													0887-3593					MAR	2006	25	1					185	197		10.1899/0887-3593(2006)25[185:ODSOAO]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1899/0887-3593(2006)25[185:ODSOAO]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000236565400015

The crater lake has high temperatures (50-90-degrees-C), high acidity (pH almost-equal-to 0.0), and a high dissolved-solids content (100 g/kg). The volcano has numerous freshwater springs on its flanks, but a few on the northwestern flank are highly acidic (pH = 1.6-2.5) and have high dissolved-solids concentrations (2-22 g/kg). This study analyzes the regional groundwater system at Poas and demonstrates the likelihood that the water discharging from the acidic springs in the Rio Agrio watershed originates at the acidic crater lake. Both heat and solute transport are analyzed on a regional scale through numerical simulations using the HST3D finite-difference model, which solves the coupled equations for fluid flow, heat transport, and solute transport. The code allows fluid viscosity and density to be functions of both temperature and solute concentration. The simulations use estimates for recharge to the mountain and a range of values and various distributions of permeability and porosity. Several sensitivity analyses are performed to test how the uncertainty in many of the model parameters affects the simulation results. These uncertainties yield an estimated range of travel times from the crater lake to the Rio Agrio springs of 1-30 years, which is in close agreement with the results of tritium analyses of the springs. Calculated groundwater fluxes into and out of the crater lake are both about several hundred kg/s. These fluxes must be accounted for in water budgets of the crater lake.

The Lateglacial landscape was dominated by open herb vegetation composed of Artemisia, Chenopodiaceae, Poaceae, and other cold-resistant herbs (14,000-11,700 cal. yr BP). Stands of Pinus, Betula, and Juniperus-Ephedra shrubland partly enlarged during the Lateglacial interstadial. Pioneer forests of Betula with Pinus and Juniperus occupied barren soils in the early Holocene (11,700-7900 cal. yr BP), while mixed oak forests with Tilia, Ulmus, Acer, and later on Corylus spread at lower elevations. A coniferous forest belt with Pinus sylvestris, Pinus peuce, and Abies developed after 7900 cal. yr BP in the conditions of milder winters, cooler summers, and increase in precipitation. The late Holocene dynamic vegetation changes were associated with the invasion of Picea abies after 3400 cal. yr BP, while Fagus communities slightly enlarged in the river valleys. Indications of human activities are visible in the pollen diagram since the Late Bronze Age' (3400-3200 cal. yr BP). The vegetation development in the study area followed a similar pattern when compared with palynological and macrofossil records from other parts of the Rila and the adjacent Northern Pirin Mountains. On a larger geographical scale, the postglacial vegetation history of the Rila Mountains displays common features with sites in the Romanian Carpathians, whereas the differences observed are result of the location of tree refugia, competing abilities, climate changes, and human activities.					; Tonkov, Spassimir/AAK-4705-2021	Tonkov, Spassimir/0000-0002-0750-4872; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				JAN	2016	26	1					17	28		10.1177/0959683615596825	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683615596825													WOS:000367628300002
J	Zhao, WW; Andreev, AA; Tarasov, PE; Wennrich, V; Melles, M				Zhao, Wenwei; Andreev, Andrei A.; Tarasov, Pavel E.; Wennrich, Volker; Melles, Martin			Vegetation and climate during the penultimate interglacial of the northeastern Russian Arctic: the Lake El'gygytgyn pollen record	BOREAS												We present a high-resolution reconstruction of the vegetation and climate dynamics during the penultimate interglacial, corresponding with Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 7, based on detailed palynological analyses of lacustrine sediments from Lake El'gygytgyn, northeastern Siberia. The analysed sediments were deposited between 246 and 181ka ago (late MIS 8 to early MIS 6.6). The interglacial vegetation was characterized by herb and shrub (mainly alder and birch) dominated plant communities. Pollen-based biome reconstruction shows a dominance of the tundra (TUND) biome, thus indicating rather open vegetation. Warmer intervals (MIS 7.5, 7.3 and 7.1) were marked by an increase in the cold deciduous forest (CLDE) biome scores and a synchronous decrease in the cold steppe (STEP) biome scores. The thermal maximum occurred during MIS 7.1, as indicated by the highest CLDE biome scores occurring in this period, and lasted similar to 10ka, possibly favoured by the high precession-related summer insolation and the legacy of the preceding mild and dry stadial (MIS 7.2). In contrast, MIS 7.3 and 7.5 were characterized by shorter durations (similar to 4ka) and lower summer temperatures. The preceding cold glacial and stadial (MIS 8 and 7.4, respectively) might have led to an extensive distribution of permafrost that hindered vegetation development during the subsequent warm intervals. MIS 7.4 and 6.6 were cold and wet, probably triggered by low obliquity values and coevally lowprecession-related summer insolation. As a result, these periods were marked by significantly reduced summer temperatures and an enhanced snow-ice albedo feedback. The obtained reconstructions provide potential scenarios for future climate changes and allow a better understanding of the relationship between vegetation, climate and external/internal forcings in the high latitudes.

The model was first presented in 2007 and has gained increasing attention. It is a core element of the Landcover 6k initiative within the PAGES project. The REVEALS model has two critical components: the pollen dispersal model and pollen productivity estimates (PPEs). To study the consequences of model settings, we implemented REVEALS in R. We use a state-of-the-art Lagrangian stochastic dispersal model (LSM) and compare model outcomes with calculations based on a conventional Gaussian plume dispersal model (GPM). In the LSM turbulence causes pollen fall speed to have little effect on the dispersal pattern whereas fall speed is a major factor in the GPM. Dispersal models are also used to derive PPEs. The unrealistic GPM produces PPEs that do not describe actual pollen productivity, but rather serve as a basin specific correction factor. A test with pollen and vegetation data from NE Germany shows that REVEALS performs best when applied with the LSM. REVEALS applications with the GPM can produce realistic results, but only if unrealistic PPEs are used. We discuss the derivation of PPEs and further REVEALS applications. Our REVEALS implementation is freely available as the 'REVEALSinR' function within the R package DISQOVER. REVEALSinR offers an environment for experimentation and analysing model sensitivities. We encourage further experiments and welcome comments on our tool.

We report data collected from 48 replicated microcosm communities created to mimic plant-dominated shallow lake and pond environments. Over a 2-year period, the microcosms were subjected to warming treatments (continuous 3 degreesC above ambient and 3 degreesC above ambient during summer only), a nutrient addition treatment and the presence or absence of fish. We tracked macro-zooplankter dynamics, censusing cladoceran populations at the species level, copepods at the order level and ostracods as a class. 2. Responses to warming were subtle. Cladoceran diversity and overall abundance were not significantly affected by warming, although measures of community evenness increased. Warming effects on patterns of population trajectories tended to be strongly seasonal and most apparent during periods of pronounced increase. Populations of the prevalent cladocerans, Chydorus sphaericus and Simocephalus vetulus, displayed idiosyncratic patterns, with evidence in the case of S. vetulus for a negative relationship between warming and body-size at maturity. Copepod populations were reduced in size by warming, but those of ostracods increased. 3. The effects of the nutrient addition and fish treatments were strong and consistent, interacting little with warming effects in statistical models. Zooplankter abundance tended to be the highest in the fish-free microcosms receiving additional nutrient inputs and lowest when fish were present and no nutrients were added. Both treatments reduced cladoceran diversity and community evenness. 4. We suggest that warming, independently, is unlikely to supplant the effects of changing nutrient loading and fish predation as the major driver of zooplankter dynamics in shallow lakes and ponds. Moreover, in the situations where warming was of significant influence in our experiment, the distinction between summer-only warming and year-around warming was blurred. This suggests that warming effects were most pervasive during the summer, at the upper end of the temperature spectrum.

THE EFFECT OF SEX, MATURITY AND SEASON	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												The sterol composition of mature males, ovigerous females and juveniles of N. integer (Leach) were compared. Seasonal samples of 2 separate populations of Neomysis, one estuarine and the other brackish-lake, were analyzed. Sex and degree of maturity do appear to influence the sterol composition of Neomysis, juveniles apparently developing a rather different composition to that of the ovigerous female. Environmental temperature does not appear to have any effect on the sterol composition of Neomysis but the position regarding long-term environmental salinity changes is not clear. During the spring bloom, the phytoplankton may be responsible for what appears to be a diet-related pulse in the sterol chemistry of Neomysis. Apart from the period of the spring bloom, there is little variation in sterol composition for the remainder of the year, indicating the ability of the animals to maintain a fairly consistent mixture of structural sterols from what is likely to be a variety of dietary sterols.																			0022-0981	1879-1697					1981	53	2-3					105	114		10.1016/0022-0981(81)90012-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-0981(81)90012-5													WOS:A1981LY65300001

Long and short-term change in the Patzcuaro Basin, central Mexico	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Data are presented from four new cores from the Patzcuaro, basin in the volcanic highlands of central Mexico, which provide new insights into climate change and human impact over the last 23,000 cal. yr (19,000 (14)C yr) BP. The cores have been analysed for a range of proxies including mineral magnetic properties, loss-on-ignition, diatoms and stable isotope composition (delta(18)O and delta(13)C. High lake levels are recorded in the late Pleistocene and early Holocene, with a probable shift from winter precipitation from the Pacific in the late Pleistocene, to the modem summer regime in the early Holocene. Gradual drying and increased climatic variability are indicated from the early Holocene, but particularly since 4000 cal. BP, consistent with southward displacement of the ITCZ. The changing chemical composition and depth of the lake led to the accumulation of ostracod layers. The timing of the late Holocene dry intervals corresponds to global periods of rapid change driven by Bond and/or solar cycles. By combining a range of proxies we have been able to identify climatic change, even within a period of significant human disturbance. The use of multiple cores indicates that: a coherent climatic signal is recorded even in a basin subject to tectonic disturbance. This study also provides new data to support the interpretation of major human impact on the basin in both the pre- and post-Hispanic periods, refuting continued suggestions that basin-wide erosion occurred only after the Spanish conquest. A new model of sediment un-mixing has been applied to identify different source materials contributing to deposition. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Cyanophycin accumulated under nitrogen-fluctuating and high-nitrogen conditions facilitates the persistent dominance and blooms of Raphidiopsis raciborskii in tropical waters	WATER RESEARCH												Nutrient storage is considered a critical strategy for algal species to adapt to a fluctuating nutrient supply. Luxury phosphorus (P) uptake into storage of polyphosphate extends the duration of cyanobacterial dominance and their blooms under P deficiency. However, it is unclear whether nitrogen (N) storage in the form of cyanophycin supports persistent cyanobacterial dominance or blooms in the tropics where N deficiency commonly occurs in summer. In this study, we examined genes for cyanophycin synthesis and degradation in Raphidiopsis raciborskii, a widespread and dominant cyanobacterium in tropical waters; and detected the cyanophycin accumulation under fluctuating N concentrations and its ecological role in the population dynamics of the species. The genes for cyanophycin synthesis (cphA) and degradation (cphB) were highly conserved in 21 out of 23 Raphidiopsis strains. This suggested that the synthesis and degradation of cyanophycin are evolutionarily conserved to support the proliferation of R. raciborskii in N-fluctuating and/or deficient conditions. Isotope N-15-NaNO3 labeling experiments showed that R. raciborskii QDH7 always commenced to synthesize and accumulate cyanophycin under fluctuating N conditions, regardless of whether exogenous N was deficient. When the NO3--N concentration exceeded 1.2 mg (L-1), R. raciborskii synthesized cyanophycin primarily through uptake of N-15-NaNO3. However, when the NO3--N concentration was below 1.0 mg L-1, cyanophycin-based N was derived from unlabeled N-2, as evidenced by increased dinitrogenase activity. Cells grown under NO3--N < 1.0 mg L-1 had lower cyanophycin accumulation rates than cells grown under NO3--N > 1.2 mg L-1. Our field investigation in a large tropical reservoir underscored the association between cyanophycin content and the population dynamics of R. raciborskii. The cyanophycin content was high in N-sufficient (NO3--N > 0.45 mg L-1) periods, and decreased in N-deficient summer. In summer, R. raciborskii sustained a relatively high biomass and produced few heterocysts (< 1%). These findings indicated that cyanophycin-released N, rather than fixed N, supported persistent R. raciborskii blooms in N-deficient seasons. Our study suggests that the highly adaptive strategy in a N-2-fixing cyanobacterial species makes mitigating its bloom more difficult than previously assumed.					; Paerl, Hans/ABE-7384-2020	Lu, Zhe/0009-0003-9109-7943; paerl, hans/0000-0003-2211-1011													0043-1354	1879-2448				MAY 1	2022	214								118215	10.1016/j.watres.2022.118215	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.118215		FEB 2022						35228039					WOS:000787888300004

Over the past three decades, these deposits have attracted considerable attention in Quaternary paleoclimate research. Nevertheless, our understanding of these high- altitude aeolian deposits is significantly less than that for similar deposits in the low-altitude regions of the Eurasian continent. To better comprehend this important archive, it is essential to integrate knowledge from various perspectives. However, there is a lack of consensus regarding their formation, distribution, chronology, provenance, and paleoclimatic history across different timescales. Here, based on our recent field investigations and new data, along with previously published data, we present the results of a systematic analysis of aeolian deposits on the southern TP. Our principal results and findings are: (1) We present up-to-date maps of the aeolian deposits, consisting of an overview map of the overall spatial distribution, and six high-resolution regional maps highlighting details of the depositional areas. Loess and sand dunes have accumulated within the six subdomains, following the global pattern of dust accumulation along rivers in arid and semi-arid regions. (2) Based on paleomagnetic and ESR dating, the oldest aeolian sediments were formed during the middle Pleistocene. The probability density of 220 OSL and AMS 14 C ages reveals that 98.7 % of the young sediments accumulated since the last interglacial, with the majority (66.4 %) forming during the Holocene. A comparison of age clusters with records of ice volume, temperature, precipitation, vegetation, and paleolakes revises previous hypotheses regarding the factors influencing dust deposition, emphasizing the dominant control of climate change. (3) The aeolian sediments are of local origin and their sources remained relatively stable over time. Quantitative analysis of 48 samples using geochemical fingerprinting showed that the aeolian sediments are a mixture of various clastic materials derived from upstream areas, with the predominant contribution from sand dunes (58.7 %). (4) We examined the climatic evolution of this region and its driving mechanisms during the middle to late Pleistocene and the Holocene. This analysis suggests that changes in cold and warm season insolation were the primary external drivers of moisture and dust activity on both orbital and sub-orbital scales. The winter mid- latitude Westerlies and the Indian summer monsoon, which are influenced by these seasonal insolation variations, regulated the moisture evolution, while the near-surface winds, primarily driven by cold season insolation and influenced by ice volume and oscillations in North Atlantic climate, played a significant role in modulating dust activity. Accordingly, we present a comprehensive conceptual model to illustrate the theoretical framework of aeolian sedimentary landscapes and their impacts and responses to regional and global climate changes. Overall, this review contributes to an improved understanding of the late Quaternary evolution of dust deposition and the environment on the southern TP.

It is focused on the microscopic evidence for glaciolacustrine varve sedimentation in the Baltic Ice Lake and the possibilities of making a detailed facies classification of the sediments in an area with an established varve chronology. The material examined was cores taken from five representative localities in an area below the highest shoreline of the Baltic Ice Lake in the provinces of Skane and Blekinge, i.e., below an altitude of 55-65 m. The investigations included chemical analyses, XRD, microscopy (polarized) and SEM-EDX investigations of the summer and winter layers of the varves, The results of the chemical, clay mineralogy (XRD) and microscopic examinations of the bedrock and mineral fragments indicate that the material in the different facies of the varved clay is mainly produced by moderate alteration and erosion from the local bedrock of predominantly granitoid rocks and of residual kaoline deposits. It is possible to distinguish microscopic evidence of four varve types differing in texture depending on the water depth and how close to the ice the different facies were deposited, i.e., if they were deposited proximally, distally or extramarginally in relation to the ice margin. It is also possible to relate these differences to changes in the palaeoclimate during the deglaciation of the area in the Bolling and Older Dryas chronozones. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Although such stocking established many successful fisheries, there were troublesome die-offs of adult striped bass (3-9 kg, generally >5 kg) in some waters, usually in late summer. In contrast, juveniles and small adults thrived. In response to these patterns, my students and I conducted several years of telemetry studies of adult striped bass, primarily in Cherokee and Watts Bar reservoirs, Tennessee, and laboratory studies of juvenile temperature selection. In 1985, I published the "temperature oxygen squeeze" hypothesis to explain mortalities of large fish on the basis of limited availability of cool (<25 degrees C), oxygenated (>2 mg/L) water in summer while juveniles successfully occupied a warmer thermal niche (>25 degrees C). We now have more than 20 years of research and management since 1985, primarily across the Southeast, in which the published hypothesis has, explicitly or not, been tested, generally confirmed, and applied to management. This retrospective paper reviews the studies our team conducted to develop and test the hypothesis and about 20 years of relevant studies by others that have added important nuances, addressed lingering issues, and turned a controversial idea into generally accepted understanding and management practice. Nonetheless, issues remain for understanding the effects of poor summer habitat on striped bass, such as why some studies show striped bass occupying warmer temperatures without mortalities and the role of prey availability in survival of fish obliged to occupy warm water. Other papers in this volume augment and extend the saga of progressively developing knowledge that this paper recalls of striped bass habitat requirements, thermal niche segregation by size (or age), and management constraints and opportunities.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-36-3				2013	80						65	91																WOS:000323292100005
J	Albright, M				Albright, M			Changes in water quality in an urban stream following the use of organically derived deicing products	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Willow Brook receives runoff from Cooperstown, NY and flows into Otsego Lake, a phosphorus limited, mesotrophic waterbody. Between 1992 and 1998, the Village of Cooperstown's winter road management policy included plowing and applying abrasives (particulate material intended to increase traction) mixed with enough salt to minimize clumping. Between 1998 and 2002, Ice Ban Magic (TM) and Magic Minus Zero (TM), both organic deicers mixed with magnesium chloride, were applied experimentally in conjunction with abrasives and salt. During the winter of 2002/2003, road treatment consisted solely of applications of salt which had been treated with Magic Minus Zero (TM). Precipitation-based monitoring on Willow Brook conducted between 1991 and 2003 revealed significant declines in the export of total phosphorus, despite elevated phosphorus levels in Ice Ban Magic (TM) and Magic Minus Zero (TM), and suspended sediment as the volume of abrasives applied to roads was reduced. Chloride levels are increasing, however. The implicit trade-offs between potential pollutants and the cost of road management in cold climates are acknowledged for management of transportation safety.																			1040-2381					MAR	2005	21	1					119	124		10.1080/07438140509354419	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140509354419													WOS:000228568300013

Bacterial Succession within an Ephemeral Hypereutrophic Mojave Desert Playa Lake	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Ephemerally wet playas are conspicuous features of arid landscapes worldwide; however, they have not been well studied as habitats for microorganisms. We tracked the geochemistry and microbial community in Silver Lake playa, California, over one flooding/desiccation cycle following the unusually wet winter of 2004-2005. Over the course of the study, total dissolved solids increased by a1/210-fold and pH increased by nearly one unit. As the lake contracted and temperatures increased over the summer, a moderately dense planktonic population of a1/21 x 10(6) cells ml(-1) of culturable heterotrophs was replaced by a dense population of more than 1 x 10(9) cells ml(-1), which appears to be the highest concentration of culturable planktonic heterotrophs reported in any natural aquatic ecosystem. This correlated with a dramatic depletion of nitrate as well as changes in the microbial community, as assessed by small subunit ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of bacterial isolates and uncultivated clones. Isolates from the early-phase flooded playa were primarily Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes, yet clone libraries were dominated by Betaproteobacteria and yet uncultivated Actinobacteria. Isolates from the late-flooded phase ecosystem were predominantly Proteobacteria, particularly alkalitolerant isolates of Rhodobaca, Porphyrobacter, Hydrogenophaga, Alishwenella, and relatives of Thauera; however, clone libraries were composed almost entirely of Synechococcus (Cyanobacteria). A sample taken after the playa surface was completely desiccated contained diverse culturable Actinobacteria typically isolated from soils. In total, 205 isolates and 166 clones represented 82 and 44 species-level groups, respectively, including a wide diversity of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Gemmatimonadetes, Acidobacteria, and Cyanobacteria.					; Hedlund, Brian/HJY-8944-2023; Rosen, Michael/D-6091-2015	Hedlund, Brian/0000-0001-8530-0448; Dong, Hailiang/0000-0002-7468-1350; Rosen, Michael/0000-0003-3991-0522; Ross, Paige/0000-0002-4157-3951													0095-3628	1432-184X				FEB	2009	57	2					307	320		10.1007/s00248-008-9426-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-008-9426-3								18758846					WOS:000262829500010
J	Chen, CTA; Lan, HC; Lou, JY; Chen, YC				Chen, CTA; Lan, HC; Lou, JY; Chen, YC			The dry Holocene Megathermal in Inner Mongolia	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The paleoclimate since 14 kyr BP (C-14 age) was reconstructed based on a 16.22-m-long sediment core collected from Lake Yanhaizi, a saline lake located near the northern limit of the East Asian summer monsoon in Inner Mongolia. Coarse sediments were deposited there during a shrinkage phase of the lake when sand dunes reactivated. These sediments have low organic carbon contents but high maturity indices, indicating that they were deposited in an and environment. By contrast, based on high organic contents and low maturity indices, fine sediments were deposited during periods of high lake stand in a humid environment. It was in general dry between 8.0 and 4.3 kyr BP. The above dry and wet phases are consistent with those recovered from the arid-semiarid transition zone elsewhere, but are unlike the widely perceived humid Holocene Megathermal reported in east China and the newly reconstructed record in the alpine Retreat Lake in Taiwan. The discrepancy may be due to a relative insensitivity to humidity changes in these two areas since they have both been under the total influence of the summer monsoon. On the other hand, much enhanced evaporation over higher monsoon precipitation at Lake Yanhaizi reduces the effective humidity in the warm climate near the northern boundary of the summer monsoon. This also accounts for the fact the high-temperature Holocene Megathermal, as revealed in the Okinawa Trough and the northern South China Sea, is correlated to the dry phases at Lake Yanhaizi. Conversely, the 4-2-kyr BP coldest period in the Holocene corresponds to a wet phase at Lake Yanhaizi. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

An opportunity to observe the potential consequences of zooplankton dominated by ciliates arose when winter fish kills resulted in strong suppression of crustaceans by young planktivorous fish in two shallow lakes. On an annual average, ciliates made up 38-76% of the total zooplankton biomass in both lakes during two subsequent years. Consequently, ciliate biomass and their estimated grazing potential were extremely high compared with other lakes of various trophic states and depths. Grazing estimates based on abundance and size suggest that ciliates should have cleared the water column of small (<5 mu m) and intermediate (5-50 mu m) sized phytoplankton more than once a day. Especially, small feeders within the ciliates were important, likely exerting a strong top-down control on small phytoplankton. Particle-attached bacteria were presumably strongly suppressed by intermediate-sized ciliate feeders. In contrast to other lakes, large phytoplankton was proportionately very abundant. The phytoplankton community had a high evenness, which may be attributed to the feeding by numerous fast growing and selective ciliate species. Our study highlights ciliates as an important trophic link and adds to the growing awareness of the role of winter processes for plankton dynamics.

Since it is easily available to all, its importance and its role in the life of the individuals as well as that of the community is overlooked. Matters related to the Islamic Injunctions and Codes will be discussed in details in the abstract. Based on Qur'anic teachings, water is both pure and an agent of purification. What it real means here is that all the uncleanness can be cleansed through the use of water. One can perform ablution, and do 'Qosl'. Wastage of water is forbidden in Islam and that Islam teaches the observance of the injunctions pertaining to water. The waters of seas, lakes and rivers are considered public property. While the subsurface water would under the prescribed conditions bring about the norm of the observation of the 'law of priority' but not possession. Other items discussed in the abstract include, the purchase and sale of water, the boundaries of wells and boil springs, etc. Imam Ja'afar Sadeq (AS), The Sixth Imam and Rightful Successor of the Prophet's Household, stated that: "the demarcation of the boundaries of both wells and boil springs should be based on the premise that when another well is dug or subterranean water is tapped from a boil spring, it would not cause damage to the well or boil spring in the vicinity." Some of the other items which also appear in the abstract include the acceptable manners of drinking water.																									1997							209	242																WOS:000165528200021

The environmental quantum yield is 0.18. Photolysis of DEGDN initially forms nitrate ion and 2-hydroxyethyl nitratoacetate; the latter photolyzes further to 1- and 2-carbon acids and additional nitrate. DEGDN biotransforms with a second-order rate constant of 3.9 x 10(-11) mL cell-1 h-1, corresponding to a half-life of about 2 years in a typical surface water. Intermediate biotransformation products were observed but were further transformed and did not accumulate. DEGDN is expected to move readily through soils because it had low soil sorption coefficients K(p) of 2 and 0.8 g mL-1 on EPA-5 and EPA-18 sediments, respectively. Abiotic reduction occurred rapidly in lake and river sediments but the importance of this process for overall fate is difficult to quantitate. Other fate parameters measured at 25-degrees-C were a water solubility of 3900 mg L-1, octanol/water partition coefficient of 9.6 (dimensionless), Henry's constant of < 10(-6) (dimensionless), base-catalyzed hydrolysis constant of 7 x 10(-7) M-1 s-1, neutral hydrolysis constant less-than-or-equal-to 2 x 10(-8) s-1, and biouptake constants of < 10 g dry cells/g water for Anabena flos-aquae and Selenastrum capricornutum.																			0045-6535						1991	23	2					215	230		10.1016/0045-6535(91)90108-P	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0045-6535(91)90108-P													WOS:A1991GF81400008

This resulted in a strong reduction of the flow in the river Vassbygdelvi, the inlet river to lake Vassbygdvatn. In the downstream river Aurland, the flow has varied, but from 2000 the intention has been to simulate pre-regulation winter flow as far as possible. The temperature in the river Vassbygdelvi has increased from about 1500 degree-days per year before regulation to above 2000 degree-days after regulation. In the river Aurland the thermal regime, expressed as degree-days per year, was more or less unchanged, but a small reduction in the summer temperature and a corresponding increase during other periods was observed. The mayfly Ephemerella aurivillii (Bengtsson) was not recorded in Vassbygdelvi prior to regulation, but became abundant in the river after. Full-grown larvae were recorded 1-2 months earlier in the river Vassbygdelvi than in the river Aurland after regulation. E. aurivillii has a I-year life cycle with imagos present in June-August. Young larvae occurred from June to early September. It is concluded that larvae of E. aurivillii could not complete their life cycle within I year before regulation in the river Vassbygdelvi, due to low temperature. The study demonstrates how temperature can regulate the distribution of a species with a strict 1-year life cycle.

J	ROGERS, RS				ROGERS, RS			EARLY SPRING HERB COMMUNITIES IN MESOPHYTIC FORESTS OF THE GREAT-LAKES REGION	ECOLOGY												Herb composition in early spring (before leafout of hardwood overstories) was sampled quantitatively in 60 little-disturbed mesophytic hardwood stands in the Great Lakes region, USA. Disturbed hardwood stands and stands containing evergreens (hemlock) in the overstory were described by releve. Importance of strictly vernal growth forms, early spring annuals and ephemeroid perennials was correlated with total cover of herbs. In places with nutrient-poor mineral soil, slow rates of litter decomposition, compressed growing season, or evergreen shade, populations of vernal herbs were generally sparse, with summergreen and semi-evergreen taxa relatively important. In mesophytic woods occupying physiographically similar sites, the most significant regional differences in species importance are associated with differences in soil fertility rather than climate. Superimposed on the soil-related, specific compositional differences were gradual, more general, southeast to northwest decreases in species richness, total cover of herbs, and importance of strictly vernal growth forms (annuals and ephemeroids) relative to herbs with summergreen shoots. Within stands, the most significant influences on vernal herb composition were soil drainage and microtopography. Plants with a large proportion of shoots of recent seed origin (annuals and weedy perennials) were often strongly dominant in areas with recently exposed mineral soil, as at the edges of receding vernal pools. Plants with large subterranean organs were rare in such sites. Cover of vernal herbs tended to be high on soil mounds and very low in pits, but differences in species composition were not as well defined as they are in large-area uplands vs. broad poorly drained areas. Species abundant on large patches of bare soil (as at the edges of receding vernal pools) also tended to be common in disturbed stands. Long-lived perennials with large storage organs tended to be uncommon in disturbed stands.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1982	63	4					1050	1063		10.2307/1937244	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1937244													WOS:A1982PA88600019

The phenomenon of meromixis can result from both natural and anthropogenic factors. The aim of this study was to analyse thermal and chemical stratification in a small, deep (6 ha, H max = 24.5 m) lake. The evaluated lake had a typical summer thermal profile with a shallow epilimnion, a sharp thermocline, and a distinct monimolimnion layer in the hypolimnion, which was also maintained during circulation. The lake had a clinograde oxygen profile, with an oxygen deficit in the metalimnion and permanent anoxic conditions in the deeper layers, including during circulation. A redox zone was identified during summer stagnation. The monimolimnion formed a thermally isolated layer at a depth of around 15 m, and the chemocline was situated above the monimolimnion. In the chemocline, the EC gradient ranged from 61 to 77 mu S & BULL;cm(-1) per meter of depth in the summer and from 90 to 130 mu S & BULL;cm(-1) per meter of depth during circulation. EC was significantly correlated with Ca2+ concentration (r(2) = 0.549). Chemical stratification, particularly with regard to organic matter distribution, was observed in the chemocline. The monimolimnion severely limited nutrient internal loading.</p>					; Augustyniak, Renata/AAY-3672-2021	Augustyniak-Tunowska, Renata/0000-0003-0098-0427; Grochowska, Jolanta/0000-0001-7319-4174; Lopata, Michal/0000-0002-1993-3287; Tandyrak, Renata/0000-0001-6767-6572														2073-4441				NOV	2021	13	21							2979	10.3390/w13212979	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13212979													WOS:000718301100001

Documentation of lake sections occupied over the course of a 2-year period was used to assess the extent and magnitude of spring migrations of bass to the headwaters of the reservoir. Fish using the headwaters during the spring were drawn mainly from adjacent areas within 9 km of the headwaters, although fish from as far away as the dam were recovered in the headwater area. Use of the headwaters by smallmouth bass from the lake was estimated at less than 20% of the adult population during the spawning season. Redistribution information was also collected and showed that smallmouth bass returned to areas previously occupied prior to spawning. Spawning site fidelity was determined from 6 smallmouth bass tracked over 2 consecutive years; 3 of these fish utilized the same sites during both spawning seasons.																									2001							165	174																WOS:000184053000016

Identifying seasonal and spatial variations in aquatic bird communities and their responses to environmental factors is vital conservation efforts. However, there is a lack of information on waterfowl in Mongolian lakes and their associated wetlands. The purpose of this study was to investigate the spatial-seasonal changes in waterfowl assemblage structures in Mongolian lakes, as well as to determine how they respond to various environmental factors (lake surface area, elevation, and geographical distribution). Statistical analyses were performed using seasonal data (May, July, and September) for 28 waterfowl collected from 54 lakes across the country between 2016 and 2018. Seasonal heterogeneity in species richness and abundance was observed in lakes in each geographical region (Eastern, Central, and Western Mongolia). The composition of waterfowl in the lake was also relatively similar between May and September compared to July. This was due to the overlapping migration seasons in spring and autumn. Regionally, the number of waterfowl was much higher in the Eastern Mongolian lakes, followed by Central Mongolian lakes and then Western Mongolian lakes. This is likely due to differences in habitat availability and water levels between the regions. Eastern Mongolian lakes tend to have more wetlands and shallow water habitats, while Central and Western Mongolian lakes tend to have deeper open-water habitats. These differences in habitat types could contribute to the observed differences in waterfowl abundance among the regions. Additionally, some small lakes and the group of small lakes supported a greater abundance and diversity of waterfowl compared to some medium-sized and large lakes, suggesting that they are important for conservation. Indices of diversity (H') and species dominance (D') showed positive and negative correlations with lake surface area, respectively. Perhaps the increased surface area of the lake decreases the habitat overlap for designated waterfowl due to habitat heterogeneity. Accordingly, the indices (H' and E-H) increased as the waterfowl species composition became relatively equivalent in large lakes. Overall, spatial variations among the lakes were primarily attributable to the individual features of the lakes (shallowness, small lake groupings, and surface area), and seasonal variation in the lakes depended majorly on the compositional changes of the waterfowl due to migration.					; Jargalsaikhan, Ariunbold/JPK-9473-2023; Purevdorj, Zoljargal/AAO-6856-2021	Purevdorj, Zoljargal/0000-0003-4109-8668; Jargalsaikhan, Ariunbold/0000-0002-0615-2078; Jargal, Namsrai/0000-0002-0577-6217; 														1424-2818				MAR	2023	15	3							334	10.3390/d15030334	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d15030334													WOS:000958913000001

Seasonal trends in DOC concentration and fluorescence in the Bow River indicate that DOC in nonglacial runoff originates primarily from soil and plant organic matter that is flushed to the stream by shallow subsurface flow at the onset of snowmelt. Snowmelt in ice-free areas of the glacial catchment also appears to be routed through the shallow subsurface, but this snowmelt runoff has much less contact with organic soils or litter, than snowmelt runoff from the nonglacial catchment. The fluorescence of DOC in the Glacial stream in summer (when most runoff originates from ice-covered areas), suggests that DOC from glaciated regions is more "microbial" in character than that derived from ice-free areas. Summer rainstorms in the Glacial catchment flushed DOC derived from catchment soils and plants by displacing concentrated pre-event waters from the shallow subsurface to the stream.

Nonparametric multiplicative regression and machine learning were used to explain Chl-a concentration trend and dynamics. The main parameters of importance were seasonality, interannual variation, lake level, water temperature, the North Atlantic Oscillation, and antecedent rainfall. No evidence was found for an earlier onset of the summer phytoplankton bloom related to the earlier onset of warmer temperatures. Instead, a curvilinear relationship between Chl-a and the temperature length of season above 20 degrees C (LOS) was found with longer periods of warmer temperature leading to blooms of shorter duration. We suggest that a longer period of warmer temperatures in the summer may result in earlier uptake of nutrients or increased calcite precipitation resulting in a shortening of the duration of phytoplankton blooms. The current scenario of increasing LOS of temperature with climate change may lead to an alteration of phytoplankton phenological cycles resulting in blooms of shorter duration in lakes where nutrients become limiting. Satellite-derived information on lake temperature and Chl-a concentration proved essential in detecting trends at appropriate resolution over time.

This study investigates the precipitation prediction skills between these two rainy seasons using the S2S hindcast data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) during 2002-2021. Meiyu exhibits higher precipitation forecast skill compared to the rainy season in North China. In particular, the forecast skill is more pronounced in the southeast region during the Meiyu, while it has negative performance in central regions of the rainy season in North China. Precipitation patterns during the Meiyu are strongly influenced by the single-blocking system in the high latitude extending from the east of Lake Baikal to the Sea of Okhotsk, as well as the subtropical high at 500 hPa geopotential height in the low latitude. For the rainy season in North China, anomalies in the 500 hPa geopotential height over northeast China has a significant impact on the precipitation according to reanalysis data. The forecast skill of precipitation differs between the two rainy seasons, as well as their associared biases. The model biases are attribute to both circulation simulation and its influence on precipitation. Specifically, the prediction skills of circulation in the low latitudes are high during the Meiyu, and the relationship between circulation and precipitation is well captured. However, the prediction of circulations in the high latitude shows lower skill. During the rainy season in North China, the prediction skills for circulation in key areas are relatively high, but the relationship between circulation in key areas and precipitation is not captured, or may even exhibite an opposite relationship. Meanwhile, the model circulations at different latitudes have different responses to the El Nino state, with more biases observed in the high latitudes. In summary, the decline in prediction skills with the northward advance of the East Asian summer monsoon emphasizes the crucial role of predictability in the high latitudes.

Multiple proxy records in lake sediments can provide a large amount of extractable information for paleoclimate reconstructions and assessing the position of recent global warming within the context of natural climate variability. In this study, we reconstruct the climatic and environmental changes over the past 300 years from a remote alpine lake (Lake Cuoqia) in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau using multiple proxies including branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs), n-alkanes, elements, fatty acids and their hydrogen isotopes. Due to ice-cover nature of lake surface during winter, brGDGTs mainly reflect the variation in warm-season temperature from March to October, supported by nearby instrumental data. Our reconstructed high-resolution temperature showed a continuous cooling trend between 1700 and 1950 AD, followed by a rapid warming afterward, in parallel with other proxies such as n-alkanes and fatty acids in the same core, which is also consistent with previously published regional temperature records. The hydrogen isotope (delta D) of fatty acids, similar to regional tree-ring delta O-18, can record the history of atmospheric precipitation isotope and further indicate the variations of regional relative humidity. Our record exhibited a long-term decrease since 1700 AD, in accord with the decreasing lake level inferred from the ratio of Fe/Mn. The combined pattern of reconstructed temperature and relative humidity showed consistent changes before 1950 AD toward to a gradually cold-dry trend, whereas started to decouple afterward. Before 1950 AD, the declined temperature and relative humidity are mainly driven by insolation and thermal contrast between the Indian-Pacific Ocean and south Asian continent. After 1950 AD, decoupling of temperature and relative humidity may be related to the increased regional evaporation and human-induced emission of greenhouse gases and aerosol.																			2296-701X					FEB 14	2023	11								1119869	10.3389/fevo.2023.1119869	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2023.1119869													WOS:000939812500001

Assessment of Two Techniques for Remediation of Lacustrine Rocky Reef Spawning Habitat	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Rocky reef habitats in lacustrine systems constitute important areas for lithophilic-spawning fishes. Interstitial spaces created by the structure of rocky reefs form microenvironments where incubating embryos and juvenile fish are potentially protected from predators and physical displacement. However, if interstitial spaces are filled or blocked by sediment or biofouling, the reef structure may lose these benefits. Common practices to restore reef habitat include augmentation of existing reef structures or construction of new reefs, though these practices can be costly. We explored an alternative approach for reef remediation. In 2018, we developed two benthic sled cleaning devices that used either propulsion or pressurized water jets and were towed behind a small vessel to clean reefs. We used the devices to clean two impaired natural rocky reefs in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron. We indexed effectiveness of cleaning by measured changes in substrate relative hardness before and after cleaning. A biological response to reef cleaning was also measured by egg deposition of fall (Lake Whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis) and spring (Walleye Sander vitreus) lithophilic spawners. We found that our propulsion cleaning device was more effective in increasing substrate relative hardness than was the water jet device, although this was not consistent among all study locations. We also found that egg deposition on study plots was variable, but in general, egg deposition was highest on study plots that had the greatest increases in relative hardness post-cleaning. The practicality of cleaning devices is likely related to the magnitude of site-specific degradation. Our results indicate that the use of these or similar devices can potentially increase the quality of spawning habitat by displacing sediments that have deposited on reef structures.

Among the 729 S. schlegelii specimens sampled seasonally in February, May, August and November between 2011 and 2015, most were males (sex ratio = 1 male:0.79 female). The LWRs of each season were significant (P < 0.05), and all coefficients of determination (r (2)) were higher than 0.95. The values of the slope (b) estimated for each LWR regression varied from 2.947 to 3.277 and were lower in spring than those in other seasons, especially in females. The LLRs calculated as the regression of TL on SL and vice versa were linear. The values of K ranged from 0.791 to 2.981 in males (n = 407) and from 0.752 to 2.681 in females (n = 322), and the highest value was found in spring. The present results provide baseline information on biological data of LWRs, LLRs, and K for S. schlegelii in this area, and will be useful in further studies on stock management of S. schlegelii.

J	Shelton, ML				Shelton, ML			Watershed heterogeneity and the response to 2 x CO2 climate:: A case study from the Upper Deschutes Basin, Oregon	PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												A fully allocated surface water supply in the Upper Deschutes Basin, Oregon, intensifies concern for the watershed's response to climate change. Such concern provides the impetus for this case study of the basin under a potential doubling of atmospheric trace gas concentrations (2 x CO2). Modeling the watershed as four sectors incorporates climate and landscape heterogeneity and defines a control climate that closely simulates adjusted gaged runoff. Monthly temperature and precipitation from a limited area model nested in a global circulation model define changes for modeling the watershed 2 x CO2 climate. Precipitation increases are greatest in the Wickiup sector and least in the Little Deschutes sector for a 2 x CO2 climate, but snow-water equivalent decreases substantially in all sectors. Summer water deficits are extended and magnified in all sectors and increase by 175% in the Wickiup sector, Water surplus increases range from 34% for Wickiup to 5% for Benham Falls. Average monthly runoff for the Upper Deschutes Basin increases by 7 mm or 24% in the 2 x CO2 climate, but the greatest monthly runoff differences are for the Crescent Lake sector, where February and March runoff increase by 68% and May runoff decreases by 10%. The earlier occurrence of maximum and minimum 2 x CO2 climate runoff of one to five months significantly alters the Upper Deschutes Basin runoff regime.																			0272-3646					MAY-JUN	2001	22	3					204	221		10.1080/02723646.2001.10642738	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02723646.2001.10642738													WOS:000174111000002
J	Kahlert, M; Hasselrot, AT; Hillebrand, H; Pettersson, K				Kahlert, M; Hasselrot, AT; Hillebrand, H; Pettersson, K			Spatial and temporal variation in the biomass and nutrient status of epilithic algae in Lake Erken, Sweden	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The aim of this study was to estimate patchiness in biomass and in the internal nutrient status of benthic algae on hard substrata (epilithon) in Lake Erken, Sweden, over different levels of distance, depth and time. Knowledge of the sources and scale of patchiness should enable more precise estimation of epilithic biomass and nutrient status for the entire lake. We focused on the horizontal scale, about which little is known. 2. We sampled epilithon by SCUBA diving and used a hierarchical sampling design with different horizontal scales (cm, dm, 10 m, km) which were nested in two temporal scales (within and between seasons). We also compared two successive years and three sampling depths (0, 1 and 4 m). Biomass was measured as particulate carbon and chlorophyll a (Chl a ) and internal nutrient status as carbon : nitrogen : phosphorus (C : N : P) ratios and as specific alkaline phosphatase activity (APA). 3. Horizontal variation accounted for 60-80 and 7-70% of the total variation in biomass and in nutrient status, respectively, at all depths and during both years. Both small and large scales accounted for significant variation. We also found variation with time and depth. Biomass increased in autumn after a summer minimum, and the within-season variation was very high. The lowest biomass was found at 0 m depth. Both N and P limitation occurred, being higher in 1996 than in 1997 and decreased with depth. 4. As a consequence, any sampling design must address variation with distance, depth and time when estimating biomass or nutrient limitation of benthic algae for an entire lake. Based on this analysis, we calculated an optimal sampling design for detecting change in the epilithic biomass of Lake Erken between different sampling days. It is important to repeat the sampling as often as possible, but also the large scales (10 m and km) and the dm scale should be replicated. Using our calculations as an example, and after a pilot study, an optimal sampling design can be computed for various objectives and for any lake. 5. Short-term impact of the wind, light and nutrient limitation, and grazing, might be important in regulating the biomass and nutrient status of epilithic algae in Lake Erken. Patchiness in the nutrient status of algae was not coupled to the patchiness of biomass, indicating that internal nutrients and biomass were regulated by different factors.

Controlling factors of phytoplankton distribution in the river-lake transition zone of a large lake	AQUATIC SCIENCES												River-lake transition zones have been identified as major drivers of phytoplankton growth. With climate change reducing the frequency of complete lake overturns, it is expected that the Rhone River, the main tributary to Lake Geneva (France/Switzerland), will become the major source of nutrients for the lake euphotic zone. The river-lake transition zone was hence examined at the mouth of the Rhone River with the aim of understanding the complexities and controls of phytoplankton distribution in this specific deltaic ecosystem. Two field campaigns were carried out in which water samples were collected from longitudinal and transversal transects across the transition zone. These samples were analyzed for both nutrient and phytoplankton concentrations, while the fraction of Rhone River water in a lake sample was determined by the stable isotope composition of the water. The results indicate contributions in P and Si related to the Rhone intrusion into the lake. Furthermore, this river-lake transition zone appears to be a dynamic area that can locally present optimal conditions for phytoplankton growth. In early spring, a wind event broke the early and weak stratification of the lake, forcing the Rhone River and its turbidity plume to intrude deeper. Thus, this sharp drop of the turbidity within the euphotic zone allowed an increase in the phytoplankton biovolume of 44%. In early fall, outside of the turbid near field of the river mouth, the Rhone interflow, located just below the thermocline, promoted a local deep chlorophyll maximum.

J	Na, EH; Park, SS				Na, Eun Hye; Park, Seok Soon			A hydrodynamic and water quality modeling study of spatial and temporal patterns of phytoplankton growth in a stratified lake with buoyant incoming flow	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING					Conference on Ecological Models as Decision Tools in the 21st Century	AUG 22-24, 2004	Quebec City, CANADA	Int Soc Ecol Modelling				A three-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model was applied to Lake Paldang, a lake in South Korea that is stratified by incoming flows. The spatial and temporal patterns of phytoplankton growth in this lake were determined from the model. The model was calibrated and verified using data measured under different hydrological conditions. The model results were in reasonable agreement with the field measurements, in both the calibration and verification phases. The distributions of water quality and residence time in the lake and phytoplankton response to changes in nutrient loads were examined with the model, and the influence of the hydrodynamics on phytoplankton response was analyzed. The simulation results indicated that Lake Paldang is an essentially phosphorus-limited system, but that phytoplankton growth is limited by low water temperature and short residence time during the winter and the summer monsoon period, respectively The results of sensitivity analyses also suggested that the hydrodynamics within the lake may have an indirect influence on phytoplankton responses to changes in the limiting nutrient loads, and that reducing phosphorus loading from Kyoungan Stream should be a high priority policy for controlling algal blooms during the pre- and post-monsoon periods. From this study, it was concluded that the three-dimensional water quality model incorporating hydrodynamic processes could successfully simulate phytoplankton response to changes in nutrient loads and that it could become a useful tool for identifying the essential factors determining phytoplankton growth and for developing the best management policy for algal blooms in Lake Paldang.

J	Zhu, YL; Wang, HJ; Zhou, W; Ma, JH				Zhu, Yali; Wang, Huijun; Zhou, Wen; Ma, Jiehua			Recent changes in the summer precipitation pattern in East China and the background circulation	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												This study documents the decadal changes of the summer precipitation in East China, with increased rainfall in the Huang-Huai River region (HR) and decreased in the Yangtze River region (YR) during 2000-2008 in comparison to 1979-1999. The main features of the atmospheric circulation related to the increased precipitation in the HR are the strengthened ascending motion and slightly increased air humidity, which is partly due to the weakened moisture transport out of the HR to the western tropical Pacific (associated with the weakened westerly over East Asia and the warming center over the Lake Baikal). The rainfall decrease in the YR is related to the weakened ascending motion and reduced water vapor content, which is mainly related to the weakened southwesterly moisture flux into the YR (associated with the eastward recession of the Western Pacific Subtropical High). The global sea surface temperature (SST) also shows significant changes during 2000-2008 relative to 1979-1999. The shift of the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) to a negative phase probably induces the warming over the Lake Baikal and the weakened westerly jet through the air-sea interaction in the Pacific, and thus changes the summer precipitation pattern in East China. Numerical experiments using an atmospheric general circulation model, with prescribed all-Pacific SST anomalies of 2000-2008 relative to 1979-1999, also lend support to the PDO's contribution to the warming over the Lake Baikal and the weakened westerlies over East China.

Salmonella enterica Serovar Diversity, Distribution, and Prevalence in Public-Access Waters from a Central California Coastal Leafy Green-Growing Region from 2011 to 2016	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Prevalence and serovar diversity of Salmonella enterica were measured during a 5-year survey of surface waters in a 500-mi(2 )agricultural region of the Central California Coast. Rivers, streams, lakes, and ponds were sampled bimonthly resulting in 2,979 samples. Overall prevalence was 56.4% with higher levels detected in spring than in fall. Small, but significant, differences in prevalence were detected based on sample locations. Detection of Salmonella was correlated positively with both significant rain events and, in some environments, levels of generic Escherichia coll. Analysis of 1,936 isolates revealed significant serovar diversity, with 91 different serovars detected. The most common isolated serovars were S. enterica subsp. enterica serovars I 6,8:d:- (406 isolates, 21.0%, and potentially monophasic Salmonella Muenchen), Give (334 isolates, 17.3%), Muenchen (158 isolates, 8.2%), Typhimurium (227 isolates, 11.7%), Oranienburg (106 isolates, 5.5%), and Montevideo (78 isolates, 4%). Sixteen of the 24 most common serovars detected in the region are among the serovars reported to cause the most human salmonellosis in the United States. Some of the serovars were associated with location and seasonal bias. Analysis of Xbal pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns of strains of serovars Typhimurium, Oranienburg, and Montevideo showed significant intraserovar diversity. PFGE pulso-types were identified in the region for multiple years of the survey, indicating persistence or regular reintroduction to the region. IMPORTANCE Nontyphoidal Salmonella is among the leading causes of bacterial foodborne illness, and increasing numbers of outbreaks and recalls are due to contaminated produce. High prevalence and 91 different serovars were detected in this leafy green growing region. Seventeen serovars that cause most of the human salmonellosis in the United States were detected, with 16 of those serovars detected in multiple locations and multiple years of the 5-year survey. Understanding the widespread prevalence and diversity of Salmonella in the region will assist in promoting food safety practices and intervention methods for growers and regulators.

Isotopes Reveal the Moderating Role of Ammonium on Global Riverine Water Nitrogen Cycling	ACS ES&T WATER												The relationship between delta O-18 and delta N-15 in aquatic nitrate (NO3-) is used to assess nitrogen (N) cycling, primarily relying on controlled laboratory tests of isotope fractionation from nitrification and denitrification. Nevertheless, laboratory findings frequently contradict the evolution of the nitrate delta O-18/delta N-15 ratios observed in natural river systems. We investigated this disparity by using moderated regression modeling, analyzing a global data set (n = 1303) of nitrate isotopes encompassing rivers with varying NH4+/NO3- ratios and delta O-18-H2O values. First, our analysis revealed that elevated delta O-18/delta N-15 ratios (>0.6) were prevalent in rivers with high NH4+/NO3- ratios, suggesting reducing conditions that could potentially promote denitrification and/or ammonium accumulation. By contrast, lower delta O-18/delta N-15 ratios (<0.5) predominated in rivers with low NH4+/NO3- conditions, suggesting oxidizing conditions favoring increased NH4+ removal through nitrification. Second, when delta O-18-H2O values were low, it resulted in reduced delta O-18-NO3- values during nitrification, which in turn lowered the delta O-18/delta N-15 ratios. We discovered that the delta O-18/delta N-15 ratios in nitrate were elevated in the fall, likely due to predominant processes, such as denitrification, and lower in the winter due to lower delta O-18-H2O values. This global river assessment suggests a more significant influence of ammonium and the role of water oxygen in riverine N-nutrient isotope cycling than was previously considered.

J	Wang, PF; Ma, JJ; Wang, X; Tan, QQ				Wang, Peifang; Ma, Jingjie; Wang, Xun; Tan, Qingqian			Rising atmospheric CO2 levels result in an earlier cyanobacterial bloom-maintenance phase with higher algal biomass	WATER RESEARCH												The effect of rising atmospheric CO2 on freshwater lakes is a subject of considerable debate. However, it is not clear how rising CO2 concentration affects cyanobacterial bloom development under potential nutrient limitation conditions and if CO2 should be taken into account in making nutrient reduction strategy. To fill the knowledge gaps, this study investigated the spatiotemporal variability in aquatic CO2 concentration (pCO(2)) from 2006 to 2016 in Lake Taihu, where cyanobacterial blooms often occurred from late spring to the early fall. Lake Taihu is an atmospheric CO2 source in May and November, with only 18% and 11% pCO(2)-undersaturated areas, respectively. During cyanobacterial bloom in August, 81% of the lake areas are pCO(2)-undersaturated, absorbing similar to 0.53 t C/h of atmospheric CO2. The results demonstrated that CO2 transfer across air-water interface was important in supporting cyanobacterial bloom development. Besides, Field investigation showed that the chlorophyll a level is significantly positively correlated with supersaturated pCO(2) (>13.56 mu mol/L) in May, but pCO(2) decreases with high chlorophyll a levels in August, suggesting that cyanobacterial growth would be promoted by high pCO(2) over a threshold. These observations suggested that the effect of rising atmospheric C-2 on freshwater lakes and cyanobacterial blooms should be paid attention to. Further, when the N- and P-levels are >0.3 mg/L and >0.02 mg/L, respectively, high-pCO(2) conditions allow a more rapid growth rate of cyanobacteria via improved nutrient-use efficiency. Moreover, cyanobacteria afford maximum N- or P-use efficiency at lower N- or P-concentrations with high CO2 concentration. This improvement would result in an earlier bloom-maintenance phase and higher cyanobacterial biomass. In this case, nutrient reduction is more imperative under future high CO2 conditions.

Century-long synchrony of fossil algae in a chain of Canadian prairie lakes	ECOLOGY												Synchronous fluctuations in limnological variables among lakes may signal that large-scale environmental factors regulate lake ecosystem structure, yet most estimates of temporal coherence are based on short (< 25 yr) time series, and little is known of how synchrony varies among biological taxa or of the causes of temporal coherence. Here we used time series of 13 fossil pigments from diverse algal groups in seven lakes of the climatically sensitive Northern Great Plains to demonstrate that algal synchrony (S) during the 20th century arose mainly from interdecadal increases in algal abundance rather than from interannual coherence. Synchrony of time series differed greatly among algal taxonomic groups (S = 0.0-0.75) and was not usually spatially structured, but decreased 83% following removal of long-term trends using exponential models or first-difference calculations. Overall, coherence was greatest for labile compounds chl a (S = 0.53) and fucoxanthin (S = 0.75), possibly reflecting the influence of postdepositional degradation processes on fossil time series. However, analysis of chemically stable pigments also indicated that synchrony was great for cryptophytes (as alloxanthin, S = 0.42) and diatoms (diatoxanthin, S = 0.37), taxa that bloom in spring. In contrast, synchrony of total algal abundance was low (P-carotene, pheophytin a, S < 0.10), reflecting low interannual coherence of summer taxa including colonial cyanobacteria and chlorophytes. Unexpectedly, past variations in climate, resource use, and urbanization explained > 85% of algal variation in individual lakes, but only 35% of synchronous algal fluctuations, suggesting that the factors, controlling algal synchrony differ from those regulating algal abundance.

Changes in Extreme Precipitation in the Northeast United States: 1979-2014	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												Extreme precipitation can have significant adverse impacts on infrastructure and property, human health, and local economies. This paper examines recent changes in extreme precipitation in the northeast United States. Daily station data from 58 stations missing less than 5% of days for the years 1979-2014 from the U.S. Historical Climatology Network were used to analyze extreme precipitation, defined as the top 1% of days with precipitation. A statistically significant (95% confidence level) increasing trend of the threshold for the top 1% of extreme precipitation events was found (0.3 mm yr(-1)). This increasing trend was due to both an increase in the frequency of extreme events and the magnitude of extreme events. Rainfall events >= 150 mm (24-h accumulation) increased in frequency from 6 events between 1979 and 1996 to 25 events between 1997 and 2014, a 317% increase. The annual daily maximum precipitation, or the highest recorded precipitation amount in a given year, increased by an average of 1.6 mm yr(-1), a total increase of 58.0 mm. Decreasing trends in extreme precipitation were observed east of Lake Erie during the warm season. Increasing trends in extreme precipitation were most robust during the fall months of September, October, and November, and particularly at locations further inland. The analysis showed that increases in events that were tropical in nature, or associated with tropical moisture, led to the observed increase in extreme precipitation during the fall months.

A whole year comparative field study was performed in a eutrophic lake and its connected pond with Potamogeton crispus in order to determine the effects of the growth and senescence of submerged macrophytes on structure of phytoplankton. P. crispus improved the water quality at the growing season in terms of improving transparency, decreasing total phosphorus, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and chlorophyll a concentrations and slowering turnover rate of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP). Meanwhile, dominant species shift from Chlorophyta to Diatom. Notably, senescence and decomposition of P. crispus in late spring resulted in an abrupt increase of DOP, providing a suitable growing environment for Euglena and dinoflagellates and a Peridiniopsis bloom occurred owing to their advantage in utilizing DOP. Peridiniopsis excreted phosphatase as evidence by simultaneously in situ enzyme labelled fluorescence (ELF) labelling and main alkaline phosphatase activity contributed by large particles, suggesting that the dominance of dinoflagellate with low SRP is enabled by its ability to efficiently hydrolyze DOP. Under the scenario of worldwide application of re-establishing submerged vegetation, our results provide the evidence of the negative environmental effects that occurred when transplanting P. crispus to recover a eutrophic lake.

J	Farnsworth-Lee, LA; Baker, LA				Farnsworth-Lee, LA; Baker, LA			Conceptual model of aquatic plant decay and ammonia toxicity for shallow lakes	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE												A conceptual process model was developed to examine the potential for late summer ammonia toxicity in shallow lakes. Processes represented in the model were macrophyte decay; growth, death, and sedimentation of phytoplankton; growth and death of zooplankton; nitrification; volatilization; and chemical equilibria (carbonate and ammonium systems). Peak NH3 concentrations occur at the peak of the phytoplankton bloom that develops about 2 weeks after macrophyte decay starts, when the pH is elevated.

It is hypothesized that late summer ammonia toxicity following macrophyte senescence may be a common but generally unrecognized phenomenon in shallow lakes.

Here, we present a high-resolution, multiproxy record from lowland eastern Mesoamerica, studied to reconstruct climate and vegetation history during the last 2,000 years, in particular to evaluate the response of tropical vegetation to the cooling event of the Little Ice Age (LIA). Our data provide evidence that the densest tropical forest cover and the deepest lake of the last two millennia were coeval with the LIA, with two deep lake phases that follow the Sporer and Maunder minima in solar activity. The high tropical pollen accumulation rates limit LIA's winter cooling to a maximum of 2 degrees C. Tropical vegetation expansion during the LIA is best explained by a reduction in the extent of the dry season as a consequence of increased meridional flow leading to higher winter precipitation. These results highlight the importance of seasonal responses to climatic variability, a factor that could be of relevance when evaluating the impact of recent climate change.

To improve our understanding of the mechanisms which influence year-class strength, we conducted a 225-d laboratory experiment to evaluate the effects of body size, physiological condition, energy stores, and food ration on the winter survival of age-0 lake herring. Small (total length [TL] range = 60-85 mm) and large (TL range = 86-110 mm) fish were maintained under thermal and photoperiod regimes that mimicked those in Lake Superior from October through May. Fish in each size-class were maintained at two feeding treatments: brine shrimp Artemia spp. ad libitum and no food. The mortality of large lake herring (fed, 3.8%; starved, 20.1%) was significantly less than that of small fish (fed, 11.7%; starved, 32.0%). Body condition and crude lipid content declined for all fish over the experiment; however, these variables were significantly greater for large fed (0.68% and 9.8%) and small fed (0.65% and 7.3%) fish than large starved (0.49% and 5.7%) and small starved (0.45% and 4.8%) individuals. Final crude protein and gross energy contents were also significantly greater in large fed lake herring (17.6% and 1,966 cal/g), followed by small fed (17.1% and 1,497 cal/g), large starved (15.4% and 1,125 cal/g), and small starved (13.2% and 799 cal/g) fish. Lake herring that died during the experiment had significantly lower body condition and energy stores relative to those of the surviving fish. These results suggest that the depletion of energy stores contributes to greater winter mortality of small lake herring with limited energy uptake and may partially explain the variability in recruitment observed in Lake Superior.

J	PETERS, RH				PETERS, RH			CONCENTRATIONS AND KINETICS OF PHOSPHORUS FRACTIONS IN WATER FROM STREAMS ENTERING LAKE MEMPHREMAGOG	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												This study examines the possibility that the proportions of different P fractions may vary among rivers, and that the P supplied to lakes may differ in its availability for algae regardless of any similarities in the total P concentration of river waters. Surface water from 8 streams and groundwater [near Lake Memphremagog, Vermont, USA and Quebec, Canada] was collected at roughly monthly intervals from June 1975-Sept. 1976 and analyzed to determine the concentrations of P fractions and the interrelations between these forms and orthophosphate. Despite differences in total P concentration, (18-64 .mu.g/l) the proportions of P in different fractions were relatively constant seasonally and geographically. Soluble P formed about 1/3 and PO4 < 10% to the total P. These values were not greatly affected by urban drainage but both were increased in small headwater streams during periods of low water. Soluble P was divided into 2 roughly equal fractions by gel filtration: a large MW fraction (> 5000 MW) which eluted at void volume and a small MW fraction (< 400 MW) which eluted with 32P-PO4. This latter fraction also included some small organic phosphates. Soluble reactive phosphate consistently overestimated PO4. The exchange of P between PO4 and suspended material was slow in winter and more rapid in summer, although only rivers draining lakes, embayments, or bogs reached the very rapid values reported from lakes. As in lakes, soluble organic P entered into the short-term P dynamics of streams as indicated by the labeling of large MW P during equilibration of river water with radioactive phosphate. This exchange shows that at least a portion of the soluble organic and particulate P is available to the plankton once the river water enters a lake. The uncertainty as to the size of this portion leads to uncertainty in predicting the impact of P loading on lakes.																									1978	35	3					315	328		10.1139/f78-056	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f78-056													WOS:A1978EM28600006

Larval coregonine density and diet composition along beaches of northern Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Recent oligotrophication in Lake Michigan has contributed to reduced biomass of spring zooplankton and a shift in the zooplankton assemblage toward more calanoid copepods. These changes have likely altered prey availability for first feeding native fish species that hatch in early spring. While spring zooplankton densities and assemblage compositions are routinely monitored in offshore areas of Lake Michigan, zooplankton in nearshore areas such as shallow beach environments are less studied; and associated descriptions of diet characteristics among larval coregonine species are limited. In this study, we a) describe the nearshore (<1 m depth) zooplankton assemblage at four sites in northeastern Lake Michigan during early spring 2015-2019 and b) compare diets and diet selectivity of larval lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) and Cisco (C. artedi). Zooplankton composition varied among years, but calanoid copepods and copepod nauplii consistently dominated the zooplankton assemblage. Cisco and lake whitefish larvae were captured regularly, with Elk Rapids containing the highest proportion of ciscoes each year. For both species, calanoid and cyclopoid copepods were common in diets and were positively selected as prey. Although previous research has indicated high consumption of cyclopoid copepods by larval coregonines, our results provide new evidence that larval lake whitefish and Cisco in northeastern Lake Michigan will also consume and select for calanoid copepods when they are abundant. As such, should calanoid zooplankton continue to dominate the copepod community in Lake Michigan, larval coregonines appear capable of exploiting this abundant prey resource to improve their likelihood of survival to later life stages.

Understanding the temporal and spatial variation of thermal pollution caused by dams is important to prevent or mitigate its harmful effect. Assessments based on in-situ measurements are often limited in practice because of the inaccessibility of water temperature records and the scarcity of gauges along rivers. By contrast, thermal infrared remote sensing provides an alternative approach to monitor thermal pollution downstream of dams in large rivers, because it can cover a large area and observe the same zone repeatedly. In this study, Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) thermal infrared imagery were applied to assess the thermal pollution caused by two dams, the Geheyan Dam and the Gaobazhou Dam, located on the Qingjiang River, a tributary of the Yangtze River downstream of the Three Gorges Reservoir in Central China. The spatial and temporal characteristics of thermal pollution were analyzed with water temperatures estimated from 54 cloud-free Landsat ETM+ scenes acquired in the period from 2000 to 2014. The results show that water temperatures downstream of both dams are much cooler than those upstream of both dams in summer, and the water temperature remains stable along the river in winter, showing evident characteristic of the thermal pollution caused by dams. The area affected by the Geheyan Dam reaches beyond 20 km along the downstream river, and that affected by the Gaobazhou Dam extends beyond the point where the Qingjiang River enters the Yangtze River. Considering the long time series and global coverage of Landsat ETM+ imagery, the proposed technique in the current study provides a promising method for globally monitoring the thermal pollution caused by dams in large rivers.					; Li, Xiaodong/I-1638-2014; Ling, Feng/E-4811-2013; Foody, Giles/AAE-8184-2019	Foody, Giles/0000-0001-6464-3054; Li, Xiaodong/0000-0001-8285-8446; Ling, Feng/0000-0002-0685-4897; Zhang, Yihang/0009-0008-9446-5111														2072-4292				NOV	2017	9	11							1175	10.3390/rs9111175	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs9111175													WOS:000416554100090

Shell form, maximum age (8 years) and percentage of organic matter in the shell and soft tissues were similar in both lakes. However, comparisons between same size classes revealed that mussels from Lake Maggiore were generally older, their shells heavier and their soft tissues lighter than those from Lake Candia. Recruitment occurred in both populations in June-July. The frequency distributions of adult mussels (> 30 mm) and their soft tissues and shell biomasses in all size classes (range = 2 mm) were normal, but the curves of the mussels from Lake Candia were flat in comparison to those of mussels from Lake Maggiore. The median body size of Lake Maggiore mussels was 58 mm, while that of the Lake Candia population was 72 mm. During the study period the population density of each lake was fairly constant, whereas the population structure, and consequently the biomass, showed seasonal variations. The greatest differences were found between population density and shell and tissue biomass of the two populations, which were respectively 46.86 ind. m(-2) ; 408 g d. w. m(-2) and 38.67 g dw. m(-2) in Lake Maggiore, and 6.93 ind. m(-2); 92.29 g d.w. m(-2) and 14.04 g d.w. m(-2) in Lake Candia. These values testify to the phenotypical plasticity of Unio pictorum mancus in relation to environmental characteristics, without excluding a possible genetic influence as a result ofgeographical isolation and the respective selection mechanisms. The influence exerted by the lake trophic level and by the physical environment on some population characteristics is discussed.

Recruitment traps attached to the bottom were sampled on a weekly basis throughout the summer season ( June-September). A comparison between the two sites showed that the recruitment from the shallow bay was significantly higher over the entire season for all three Microcystis species present in the lake. Maximum rates of recruitment were found in August, when 2.3 x 10(5) colonies m (-) (2) .day (-) (1) left the sediments of the shallow area. Calculated over the entire summer, Microcystis colonies corresponding to 50% of the initial abundance in the surface sediments were recruited in the shallow bay, whereas recruitment from the deep area was only 8% of the sediment colonies. From these results we conclude that shallow areas, which to a large extent have been overlooked in studies of recruitment of phytoplankton, may be crucial to the dynamics of these organisms by playing an important role as inoculation sites for pelagic populations.																			0022-3646					FEB	2003	39	1					58	63		10.1046/j.1529-8817.2003.02059.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1529-8817.2003.02059.x													WOS:000180800900007

Nutrient dynamics in a eutrophic blackwater urban lake	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Iraola ND, Mallin MA, Cahoon LB, Gamble DW, Zamora PB. 2022. Nutrient dynamics in a eutrophic blackwater urban lake. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XXX-XXX. Greenfield Lake is a eutrophic blackwater urban lake in Wilmington, North Carolina, and in 2014 was declared by the state as impaired waters due to excessive chlorophyll a concentrations. Phytoplankton production is strongly nitrogen (N) limited, and the lake supports filamentous green algal blooms in spring and N-fixing cyanobacteria blooms in summer. To inform future lake restoration efforts, we quantified nutrient loads from 5 perennial streams that drain the highly impervious Greenfield Lake watershed to determine their impact on the lake's eutrophic state. The 5 streams were sampled monthly from 2016 to 2017 during periods of dry weather and again after rain events of at least 1.2 cm to compare stormwater runoff to baseflow conditions. Two streams alone accounted for 76% of inorganic N and 63% of inorganic P surface inflow, whereas 2 other streams, despite high (53-74%) impervious coverage, had low loading. A lake-wide sediment phosphorus survey also revealed P accumulations mirrored streams of high nutrient load, while low P accumulations were in areas draining streams with large wetland and stormwater treatment areas. Drainage area was positively correlated with nitrate concentration and nitrate and ammonium loading. Unconventionally, percent impervious coverage was negatively correlated with nutrient concentrations and loads; we suspect that the presence of a large golf course in the watershed with the lowest impervious cover was a key driving factor. Our work also demonstrates the significance of catchment features: Drainages with large stormwater retention structures and significant natural wetlands in the lower reaches yielded low nutrient loadings.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				JAN 2	2022	38	1					28	46		10.1080/10402381.2021.2009069	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2021.2009069		NOV 2021											WOS:000741790600001
J	Chen, QQ; Li, CX; Li, P; Liu, BZ; Sun, HP				Chen, Qingqiang; Li, Congxian; Li, Ping; Liu, Baozhu; Sun, Heping			Late quaternary palaeosols in the Yangtze Delta, China, and their palaeoenvironmental implications	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The stiff clays beneath Holocene strata in the Yangtze Delta are interpreted as palaeosols, based on pedogenic features including illuvial argillans, voids, cracks, iron-manganese concretions and nodules, and carbonate materials. Variations in clay content with depth, the occurrence of foraminifera, and the environmental magnetism characteristics of the palaeosols suggest that their parent materials are floodplain deposits. Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) parameters of the sediments correlate well both with sedimentary dynamics and depositional processes in different sedimentary environments, and AMS analysis may be a useful tool for inferring sedimentary environments. Based on their considerable thickness (>3.0 m), vertical changes of palaeosol Maturity, and Occurrence of ageing argillans throughout the palaeosols, the palaeosols are inferred to be Compound ones (pedocomplexes) resulting from alternating deposition and pedogenesis on the palaeointerfluve of the Yangtze River. Phytoliths in the palaeosols indicate that climates turned generally from warm and wet to cold and dry with marked fluctuations during development of the palaeosols. This suggests that the palaeosols developed mainly during the marine regression prior to the last glacial maximum. The vertical distribution of manganese materials (e.g., concretions, nodules, speckles and mottles) in the palaeosols suggests that the groundwater tables were about 2.0-3.0 m beneath the upper boundary of the palaeosols during their development. Yellow-brown streaks and speckles are abundant from the middle to lower parts of the palaeosols, and layers with high CaCO3 content occur in the strata just beneath the palaeosols, but which lack caliche, suggesting that the groundwater table fluctuated markedly during their development. Voids and cracks filled with clays, and carbonate nodules (less than 0.1 mm in diameter) with thin iron-manganese rims are abundant in the palaeosols, indicating that wet and dry seasons were marked during the palaeosol development. It is suggested that the monsoonal influence was marked in the Yangtze Delta, with both winter and summer monsoons strongly developed during the development of the late Quaternary palaeosols.

This megabreccia is basically made of clays and evaporite rocks (gypsum and salt) of Upper Triassic (Keuper) age as well as other lithologies (dolostones, limestones, marls and calcareous sandstones) belonging to different ages (Jurassic, Cretaceous and Tertiary). Despite of low permeability has been traditionally assumed for these materials, water flow and storage through them is possible due to the aquitard behavior of clays and sandstones and the presence of conduits generated by dissolution/karstification processes within the evaporite rocks. The lithological complexity of the CSC determines its hydrogeological heterogeneity, with groundwater flows of different length and various scales from recharge areas to discharge zones. Thus, wetlands and springs placed at lower altitudes are associated with large (regional) groundwater flows, of greater residence time within the aquifer, and they normally drain high salinity waters mostly connected with ascending flow. This work provides an overview of the main geological and hydrogeological aspects related to groundwater flow within the CSC on the basis of several case-studies. Conceptual models are proposed for these cases, since they are the base to carry out a genetic-functional classification of wetlands potentially useful for their management.

Reconstructing the deadly eruptive events of 1790 CE at K(i)over-barlauea Volcano, Hawai'i	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												A large number of people died during an explosive eruption of K (i) over bar lauea Volcano in 1790 CE. Detailed study of the upper part of the Keanak (a) over bar ko'i Tephra has identified the deposits that may have been responsible for the deaths. Three successive units record shifts in eruption style that agree well with accounts of the eruption based on survivor interviews 46 yr later. First, a wet fall of very fine, accretionary-lapilli-bearing ash created a "cloud of darkness." People walked across the soft deposit, leaving footprints as evidence. While the ash was still unconsolidated, lithic lapilli fell into it from a high eruption column that was seen from 90 km away. Either just after this tephra fall or during its latest stage, pulsing dilute pyroclastic density currents, probably products of a phreatic eruption, swept across the western flank of Kilauea, embedding lapilli in the muddy ash and crossing the trail along which the footprints occur. The pyroclastic density currents were most likely responsible for the fatalities, as judged from the reported condition and probable location of the bodies. This reconstruction is relevant today, as similar eruptions will probably occur in the future at K (i) over bar lauea and represent its most dangerous and least predictable hazard.

With large impacts on air quality, freezing events, and especially on wind energy production, they are often poorly forecast by modern mesoscale numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Understanding the characteristics of cold pools is, therefore, important to provide more accurate forecasts. This study analyzes cold pool characteristics with data collected during the Second Wind Forecast Improvement Project (WFIP2), which took place in the Columbia River basin and Gorge of Oregon and Washington from fall 2015 until spring 2017. A subset of the instrumentation included three microwave radiometer profilers, six radar wind profilers with radio acoustic sounding systems, and seven sodars, which together provided seven sites with collocated vertical profiles of temperature, humidity, wind speed, and wind direction. Using these collocated observations, we developed a set of criteria to determine if a cold pool was present based on stability, wind speed, direction, and temporal continuity, and then developed an automated algorithm based on these criteria to identify all cold pool events over the 18 months of the field project. Characteristics of these events are described, including statistics of the wind speed distributions and profiles, stability conditions, cold pool depths, and descent rates of the cold pool top. The goal of this study is a better understanding of these characteristics and their processes to ultimately lead to improved physical parameterizations in NWP models, and consequently improve forecasts of cold pool events in the study region as well at other locations that experiences similar events.					; Friedrich, Katja/JYP-6499-2024; Leo, Laura S/J-9529-2013; BANTA, ROBERT/B-8361-2008; Bianco, Laura/AAC-8139-2022; Banta, Robert/B-8361-2008	Muradyan, Paytsar/0000-0002-6903-9435; BANTA, ROBERT/0000-0002-0009-5340; 													1558-8424	1558-8432				DEC	2019	58	12					2533	2551		10.1175/JAMC-D-19-0046.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-19-0046.1													WOS:000499240900001

Ice-Free Radiative Convection Drives Spring Mixing in a Large Lake	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												In this work we highlight the importance of radiative convection as a mixing mechanism in a large, ice-free lake (Lake Michigan, USA), where solar heating of waters below the temperature of maximum density drives vertical convection during the vernal turnover. Measurements taken over a 2-week period at a 55-m deep site demonstrate the ability of radiative convection to mix the entire water column. Observations show a diurnal cycle in which solar heating drives a steady deepening of the convective mixed layer throughout the day (dH(CML)/dt = 12.8 m/hr), followed by surface-cooling-induced restratification during the night. Radiative convection is linked to a dramatic enhancement in turbulence characteristics, including both turbulent kinetic energy dissipation (epsilon: 10(-9)-10(-7) W/kg) and turbulent scalar diffusivity (K-z: 10(-3)-10(-1) m(2)/s), suggesting that radiative convection plays a major role in driving vertical mixing throughout the water column during the isothermal spring.

Sex reversal of pejerrey (Odontesthes bonariensis), a species with temperature-dependent sex determination, in a seminatural environment	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												This study examined the changes in sex ratios and sex reversal rates in pejerrey Odontesthes bonariensis that occur with the progression of the spawning season in a seminatural setting. Four groups of hatchery-produced pejerrey larvae were stocked in floating cages in La Salada de Monasterio lake (Pampas region), a natural habitat of this species, and reared from hatching beyond gonadal sex determination with minimum human interference. Cage 1 was stocked at the beginning of the spring spawning season and the other cages were stocked with monthly delays until cage 4 in early summer. The genotypic (amhy+, XY/YY; amhy-, XX) and phenotypic (testis, male; ovary, female) sex ratios and proportions of genotype/phenotype mismatched individuals were estimated and their relation to water temperature and daylength during the experiment was analysed by generalized linear modelling. Water temperature varied between 11 and 30.5 degrees C, and daylength duration between 11 h 22 min and 14 h 35 min. Sex genotyping revealed nearly balanced sex ratios of XY/YY (46%-49.1%) and XX (50.9%-54%) fish in cages 2-4 whereas the genotypic sex ratio in cage 1 was clearly biased towards XY/YY fish (60.6%). Phenotypic males ranged from 42% to 54.4% in cages 1-3. Cage 4, in turn, had significantly more phenotypic males (66%). The percentage of XX males (phenotypic male/genotypic female) was 23.1% in cage 1, decreased to a minimum of 5.4% in cage 2 and gradually increased in cages 3 and 4 to a maximum of 40.7% in the latter. The percentages of XY/YY females (phenotypic female/genotypic male) were highest in cage 1 (30%) and decreased progressively in the other cages to a significantly lower value (4.3%) in cage 4. These results generally support the findings of laboratory studies on the effect of temperature on the sex determination of this species and also provide novel evidence of a XX genotype-specific masculinizing effect of short daylength.

J	Chen, CY; Folt, CL				Chen, CY; Folt, CL			Bioaccumulation and diminution of arsenic and lead in a freshwater food web	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												This study provides strong evidence for biotic accumulation of two metals in a contaminated watershed and diminution of both metals from lower trophic levels to fish. Bioaccumulation of As and Pb in water and four food web components (particulates, two size fractions of zooplankton, and six species of fish) were measured on three dates in Upper Mystic Lake (UML), MA, which is located in the As-contaminated Aberjona Watershed. Arsenic and Pb levels in small and large plankton and fish biodiminished with increasing trophic level, but only As was elevated in lower trophic levels relative to uncontaminated food webs. Metal levels in water and biota differed by date and were lowest in the spring and, in most cases, highest in summer samples. Variation in metal accumulation in zooplankton across dates may be due to changes in metal concentrations in the aqueous and particulate phase over time. Metal burdens in fish with different feeding strategies were also compared. We found the highest As in planktivorous species that feed directly on the metal-enriched zooplankton, but no differences were observed for Pb concentrations between fish groups. Finally, we compared the levels of As and ph in food web components in UML relative to 20 uncontaminated lakes in New England and found that As levels but not Pb in particulates and zooplankton were higher in UML. This provides the first evidence that As contamination in the Aberjona Watershed is being transferred to the biota at lower trophic levels. Nevertheless, despite elevated As in zooplankton, pronounced diminution between zooplankton and fish in UML appears to result in concentrations of As in fish that do not differ from uncontaminated systems.																			0013-936X					SEP 15	2000	34	18					3878	3884		10.1021/es991070c	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es991070c													WOS:000089315600008

The Hg spike was thoroughly mixed into the epilimion in nine separate events at two-week intervals throughout the summer growing season for three consecutive years. We measured concentrations of spike and ambient dissolved gaseous Hg (DGM) concentrations in Surface water and the rate of volatilization of Hg from the lake Oil four separate, week - long sampling periods using floating dynamic flux chambers. The relationship between empirically measured rates of spike-Hg evasion were evaluated as functions of DGM concentration, wind velocity, and solar illumination. No individual environmental variable proved to be a strong predictor of the evasion flux. The DGM-normalized flux (expressed as the mass transfer coefficient, k) varied with wind velocity in a manner consistent with existing models of evasion of volatile Solutes from natural waters but was higher than model estimates at low wind velocity. The empirical data were used to construct a description of evasion flux as a function of total dissolved Hg, wind, and Solar illumination. That model was then applied to data for three Summers for the experiment to generate estimates of Hg, re-emission from the lake surface to the atmosphere. Based on ratios of spike Hg to ambient Hg in DGM and dissolved total Hg pools. ratios of DGM to total Hg in spike and ambient Fig pools, and flux estimates of spike and ambient Hg. we concluded that the added Hg spike was chemically indistinguishable from the ambient Hg in its behavior. Approximately 45% of Hg added to the lake over the Summer was lost via volatilization.					; Hintelmann, Holger/AEV-0466-2022; Amyot, Marc/A-7182-2008; Poulain, Alexandre/C-1246-2009	Poulain, Alexandre/0000-0002-0488-3993; Hintelmann, Holger/0000-0002-5287-483X; Amyot, Marc/0000-0002-0340-3249; 													0730-7268	1552-8618				JAN	2007	26	1					53	60		10.1897/06-148R.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1897/06-148R.1								17269459					WOS:000243293800006

Pathogenesis of spring viremia of carp virus in emerald shiner Notropis atherinoides Rafinesque, fathead minnow Pimephales promelas Rafinesque and white sucker Catostomus commersonii (Lacepede)	JOURNAL OF FISH DISEASES												Spring viremia of carp (SVC) is a reportable disease to the World Organization of Animal Health (OIE) as it is known to cause significant international economic impact. In Canada, the first and only isolation of SVC virus (SVCV) was in 2006, from common carp Cyprinus carpio L., at Hamilton Harbour, Lake Ontario. The susceptibility of fathead minnow Pimephales promelas Rafinesque, emerald shiner Notropis atherinoides Rafinesque and white sucker Catostomus commersonii (Lacepede) to intraperitoneal injection of the Canadian isolate (HHOcarp06) was evaluated using experimental infection, virus isolation, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), histopathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Emerald shiner and fathead minnow were most susceptible with 43 and 53% cumulative mortality, respectively, compared with koi at 33%. Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that koi had high viral loads throughout the experiment. At 34days post-infection, SVCV was detected from sampled emerald shiner and white sucker in very low titre and was not detected from fathead minnow. Koi, fathead minnow and emerald shiner had gross lesions typical of SVC disease. The histopathological picture was mostly dominated by necrotic changes in kidney, spleen, liver, pancreas and intestine. IHC further confirmed SVCV infection, and staining was largely correlated with histological lesions.																			0140-7775	1365-2761				JUN	2016	39	6					729	739		10.1111/jfd.12405	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfd.12405								26411333					WOS:000375783600010
J	Notaro, M; Wang, WC; Gong, W				Notaro, M.; Wang, W. -C.; Gong, W.			Model and observational analysis of the northeast US regional climate and its relationship to the PNA and NAO patterns during early winter	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												The relationship between the large-scale circulation and regional climate of the northeast United States is investigated for early winter using observational data and the State University of New York at Albany regional climate model. Simulated patterns of temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric circulation compare well with observations, despite a cold, dry bias. Ten December runs are analyzed to investigate the impact of the Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern on temperature, precipitation, clouds, and circulation features. During a positive PNA pattern, the simulated and observed eastern U.S. jet shifts to the southeast, coinciding with cold, dry conditions in the Northeast. This shift and intensification of the upper-level jet stream during a positive PNA pattern coincides with a greater frequency of cyclones and anticyclones along a distinct southwest-northeast track. Despite increased cyclone activity, total wintertime precipitation is below normal during a positive PNA pattern because of enhanced stability and subsidence over land, along with lower-atmospheric moisture content. Lower surface air temperatures during a positive PNA pattern result in enhanced simulated cloud cover over the Great Lakes and Atlantic Ocean due to increased thermal contrast and fluxes of sensible and latent heat, and a reduction in clouds over land. Interactions between the PNA and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) patterns impact the Northeast winter climate. Observed frontal passages through New York are most abundant during a negative PNA and positive NAO pattern, with a zonal upper-level jet positioned over New York. A positive PNA pattern is frequently characterized by an earlier observed Great Lakes ice season, while the greatest lake-effect snowfall occurs during a positive PNA and negative NAO pattern. The NAO pattern has the largest impact on northeast U.S. temperatures and the eastern U.S. upper-level jet during a positive PNA pattern.																			0027-0644					NOV	2006	134	11					3479	3505		10.1175/MWR3234.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/MWR3234.1													WOS:000242291600026
J	Grund, Y; Pan, YD; Rosenkranz, M; Foster, E				Grund, Yuan; Pan, Yangdong; Rosenkranz, Mark; Foster, Eugene			Long-term phosphorus reduction and phytoplankton responses in an urban lake (USA)	WATER BIOLOGY AND SECURITY												Eutrophication is one of the primary factors causing harmful cyanobacteria blooms in freshwater lakes. This study investigated the long-term changes in water quality and summer phytoplankton assemblages in Oswego Lake, OR, USA, in relation to phosphorus reduction through hypolimnetic aeration and alum applications. Both water quality and phytoplankton assemblages were sampled biweekly during the summers from 2001 to 2013. The concentrations of total phosphorus, soluble reactive phosphorus, and total nitrogen decreased 66%, 93% and 31%, respectively, in response to the hypolimnetic aeration and alum treatments since 2005. Summer phyto-plankton assemblages showed a 62% reduction of cyanobacteria biovolume and a shift from cyanobacteria dominance (2001-2005) to diatom and chlorophyte dominance (2006-2013). Cluster analysis identified four statistically different groups of summer phytoplankton assemblages (denoted Groups 1-4). Nonmetric multidi-mensional scaling analysis indicated that the four groups were associated with different water quality conditions. Group 1 occurred prior to hypolimnetic aeration and was primarily comprised of cyanobacteria, associated with water conditions of high nutrients and high primary production. Group 2, dominated by cyanobacteria and chlorophytes, occurred between hypolimnetic aeration and alum surface application. Group 3 was dominated by diatoms and occurred after alum surface application. Group 4 included R-strategist phytoplankton that quickly respond to environmental changes and occurred in the years following alum injection, drawdown, and inflow alum treatment. Both Group 3 and 4 were associated with reduced nutrients in the lake. We conclude that these lake management practices had strong effects on both production and community compositions of phytoplankton, and advocate for future studies on large-scale climate impacts on lake ecosystems and to identify corresponding best management practices.																				2772-7351				FEB	2022	1	1							100010	10.1016/j.watbs.2022.100010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watbs.2022.100010													WOS:001129880800001

The Pareja limno-reservoir was among the first limno-reservoirs, and its purposes are both environmental and recreational. Phytoplankton is one of the compulsory biological indicators used to estimate ecological status in lakes and reservoirs in accordance with the European Union Water Framework Directive (WFD). Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) and phytoplankton biovolume in the Pareja limno-reservoir were studied between spring 2008 and winter 2011. Phytoplankton composition was analyzed employing the functional group approach. The suitability of several phytoplankton metrics to assess the ecological status of the limno-reservoir was verified, including Chl-a, total biovolume, cyanobacteria contribution and absolute biovolume, IGA (index de grups algals), MedPTI (Mediterranean Phytoplankton Trophic Index), Assemblage (Q) Index, and PTI (Phytoplankton Trophic Index). Phytoplankton composition was dominated by centric diatoms from functional group B, although they were replaced by other groups in some periods as a response to environmental changes. Checking the response of the phytoplankton metrics to a trophic gradient in addition to Chl-a, we determined that total biovolume, Q Index, and especially PTI were the most appropriate metrics to assess the ecological status of the Pareja limno-reservoir. This approach has relevant management implications for Mediterranean limno-reservoirs. Ecological status assessment may not yet be mandatory in countries such as Spain, but considering environmental and recreational goals, performing such assessments is advisable.

We experimentally investigated the effectiveness of three deterring actions (gas-cannon, crackers and shooting) in four study sites at Lake Como, by comparing the time-budget and space-rise of wintering grebes in absence and presence of disturbance. All dissuasion methods affected grebe behavior and position on the lake, but some resulted more effective than others. The gas-cannon detonations had little effect, but, crackers and showing caused significant changes in grebe behavior. Grebes spent less time feeding, testing and preening, but more time moving/swimming during dissuasion than in the control situation. Moreover, birds also moved away from the areas with bleak shoals, resulting in a significant decrease in grebe numbers with either dissuasion methods. Although dissuasion reduced feeding of arches in areas with shoals of Bleak (Alburnus alburnus), and probably reduced grebe predation on immature fish at localized areas, it involves intensive effort, in terms of man-days..

Our results showed that lake or swamp environment did not come into existence until similar to 13,870 cal. BP and swamp or wetland environment dominated the depression of the basin between similar to 13,870 and similar to 7430 cal. BP under ameliorated basin-wide moisture conditions. The following period between similar to 7430 and similar to 3620 cal. BP witnessed lake transgression in the depression and vegetation amelioration within the basin. The moisture conditions were continuously ameliorated from similar to 3620 cal. BP onward, leading to further lake transgression and further basin-wide vegetation amelioration. A dry interval from similar to 1400 to similar to 1150 cal. BP interrupted the late Holocene wet epoch of the past similar to 3600 years. Our synthesized (regionally-averaged) moisture index of Xinjiang area indicates that a gradual wetting climate dominated the mid- to late-Holocene in Xinjiang area. This wetting trend in Xinjiang area is hypothesized to have been associated with the winter warming and winter wetting trends in northern Europe. The gradual increase of winter insolation in mid- to late-Holocene might have enhanced evaporation in the North Atlantic Ocean and injected more moisture to the westerlies system, therefore bringing more precipitation to the downwind area including Xinjiang.

Despite advancements in sequencing technologies, the viral diversity in wintering Siberian cranes (Leucogeranus leucogeranus) and wild geese (Anser spp.) remains poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a viral metagenomic survey of fecal samples from 320 Siberian cranes and wild geese wintering in Poyang Lake, China. Through this approach, we identified 183 novel viruses associated with known and putative vertebrate-infecting viruses, including a novel coronavirus, parvoviruses, picornaviruses, picobirnaviruses, anelloviruses, and CRESS-DNA viruses. Furthermore, we detected evidence of cross-species transmission and identified viruses with zoonotic potential, such as picobirnaviruses and picornaviruses. These findings highlight the significant public health risks posed by migratory birds and provide new insights into the viral diversity within these populations, contributing to a better understanding of their role in viral evolution and transmission.IMPORTANCEUnderstanding the diversity of enteroviruses in Siberian cranes and geese is essential for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem stability. As migratory birds, these species play key roles in ecological networks while carrying intestinal viruses that may spread along migration routes, which could pose potential risks to wildlife, poultry, and human health. This study systematically analyzed enterovirus diversity and the genetic characteristics of novel viruses in wintering Siberian cranes and geese at Poyang Lake using metagenomic sequencing. We identified viral sequences distantly related to known viruses and those with potential cross-species transmission risks. These findings highlight the diversity of migratory bird viruses and their public health implications, providing data to evaluate transmission risks and monitor emerging threats, supporting strategies for wildlife conservation and disease prevention.

Here, we provide a continuous sediment record covering the past 11.1 kyrs retrieved from Beihai Wetland, which is predominantly influenced by the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) in southwest China. The temporal variation of OCAR was established and classified into five evolution stages. Subsequently, potential responses of OCAR to climatic and environmental processes were evaluated based on the Spearman's rank correlation analysis between OCAR and individual sedimentary proxies. During the early Holocene, relatively stable and low OCAR was determined owing to the predominant contributions of detrital influx and low terrestrial organic matters. Following the intensification of summer monsoon and corresponding increase in regional precipitation, extremely low OCAR were yielded in the mid-Holocene, resulted from low values of both sedimentary accumulation rate (SAR) and Loss on Ignition (LOI). The abrupt retreat of ISM led to the development of current wetland from a lake-like system, while the extremely low SAR contributed significantly to the identified low OCAR values between 5.2 and 3.0 cal. kyr BP. Afterwards, the wetland developed progressively following further retreat of ISM, that the preservation of a great amount of organic matters contributed significantly to both SAR and LOI, resulting in the highest OCAR levels during the Holocene. In addition, the rapid decline of OCAR during the last 700 years was interpreted in terms of intensified regional human activities. Such increase in OCAR during the late Holocene was broadly reported from the southwest China, proposing potential responses to the large-scale climate changes, namely the variation of ISM.					; Cui, Kai/H-4344-2011	Wang, Yongbo/0000-0002-5350-1867; Cui, Kai/0000-0002-4199-7914; 													0341-8162	1872-6887				OCT	2023	231								107316	10.1016/j.catena.2023.107316	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2023.107316		JUN 2023											WOS:001024209400001

When large shoals of juvenile perch ( Perca fluviatilis) appear in the open water, both species start to migrate vertically. Since D. pulicaria has a larger body-size than D. galeata x hyalina, and is therefore competitive dominant over the hybrid, it is unlikely that both species interact via their common food resource, but they react both to fish predation. However, since they differ in size, and therefore in vulnerability for fish predation, both species adopt different strategies. The smaller bodied, and less vulnerable D. galeata x hyalina exhibits diel vertical migration ascending to the surface at dusk, and staying there during the night. In this way, benefiting from the higher temperatures of the surface layers. In contrast, the large-bodied, and more vulnerable D. pulicaria selects the deep cold hypolimnion water layers as refuge against fish predation. In this way it benefits from a safe habitat, free from fish predators, but on the other hand suffers from low water temperatures, which decrease its fitness. It is likely that the relatively higher temperature in the upper water layers serves as a proximate factor for the downward migration of D. pulicaria.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2003	491	1-3					289	299		10.1023/A:1024459006027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1024459006027													WOS:000183771600026

Effects of common carp on phosphorus concentrations, water clarity, and vegetation density: a whole system experiment in a thermally stratified lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Although numerous studies have investigated the impacts of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) on aquatic ecosystems, the effects of this species on nutrient cycling, water clarity, and vegetation density have rarely been addressed in whole lakes, especially in those that stratify. In this study, we documented changes in total phosphorus, water clarity, and aquatic vegetation density in a stratified eutrophic lake while we reduced carp biomass from 300 to 40 kg/ha. Carp removal was associated with an increase in vegetation density, an increase in springtime water clarity, a decline in early season chlorophyll a, and a decline in total suspended solids. However, neither clarity nor chlorophyll a improved during the summer months. Carp removal also had no apparent effect on total phosphorus, which increased rapidly in the summer both before and after carp removal, and was seemingly driven by abiotic internal loading. The lack of a decline in phosphorus following carp removal suggests that despite their high biomass, carp may sometimes play a relatively minor role in nutrient transport from benthic sediments in stratified eutrophic lakes. Their removal is nonetheless beneficial for improving water clarity and restoring macrophyte communities in such systems.

Vegetation Development and Variation in Near-Surface Ground Temperatures at Illisarvik, Western Arctic Coast	COLD REGIONS ENGINEERING 2019					18th International Conference on Cold Regions Engineering and the 8th Canadian Permafrost Conference (ICCRE/CPC)	AUG 18-22, 2019	Quebec, CANADA	Canadian Geotechn Soc Eastern Quebec & Natl, Canadian Permafrost Assoc, Int Permafrost Assoc, Canadian Natl Comm, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Cold Reg Engn Div				The Illisarvik Lake basin was experimentally drained in 1978 to study growth of permafrost in the lake-bottom sediments ab initio. Ground freezing began during the first winter after drainage and led to the development of permafrost throughout the lake basin, except beneath a residual pond. This paper reports the range in near-surface ground temperatures in the basin 40 years after drainage. In summer 2016, vegetation and soil characteristics were determined throughout the basin. Snow surveys were conducted in April 2017. Since drainage, seven principal vegetation communities ( units) have developed in the basin: bare ground, sparsely vegetated soil, grass meadow, sedge marshes, and three shrub types. Characteristic snow depths in these units and in tundra surrounding the basin were 16, 27, 38, 62, 52-127, and 47 cm, respectively. Illisarvik's coastal location ensures that there is abundant snow to fill the high snow retention capacity created by tall shrubs and basin topography. Mean annual ground temperatures (T-g) at 25 cm depth were recorded by miniature data loggers in 2016-18 in the different vegetation units at 10 sites within the basin and the surrounding tundra. T-g in 2016-18 ranged from -0.1 degrees C beneath tall dense willows to -5.6 degrees C in bare ground. T-g in tundra surrounding Illisarvik was -5.2 degrees C. The factors most strongly associated with the variations in temperature were snow depth and soil moisture. Although near-surface ground temperatures at Illisarvik initially decreased as permafrost was established after drainage, the basin soils are no longer cooling due in part to increases in snow depth with the growth of vegetation.

Here, we present a new multi-proxy (delta O-18 and delta C-13 values, trace element concentrations, and grayscale values) data set of stalagmite KPC1 from Khao Prae cave in western Thailand spanning the last 1400 years (500-1900 CE; the Common Era). These multi-proxy data reveal a high variability between the wet and dry periods during 500-850 CE and 1150-1300 CE, stable climate conditions during 850-1150 CE, and overall dry conditions since 1300 CE. The delta C-13 values, trace elements concentrations, and grayscale values show centennial-scale fluctuations, which were probably driven by local hydrological processes. In contrast, variations in the stalagmite delta O-18 values reflect integrated changes in rainfall amount from the ISM. The KPC1 record agrees with other speleothem delta O-18 records of Southeast Asian summer monsoon from the last millennium, as well as the lake multi-proxy and tree-ring PDSI data from Mainland Southeast Asia, but diverges from records from the Indo-Pacific equatorial regions and the western Pacific. We conclude that hydroclimate variability at the western side of Mainland Southeast Asia is mainly driven by changes in moisture transport of the ISM. On socially relevant timescales, the KPC1 data set shows that a period of stable rainfall (850-1150 CE) coincides with the early success of the early empires (e.g., Pagan, Angkor, and Dai Viet) in Mainland Southeast Asia. In line with previous studies in the region, we speculate that the high variability in rainfall between 1150 and 1300 CE and droughts during 1300-1550 CE played a significant role in the demise of ancient societies in Southeast Asia.

J	PEVERLY, JH; KOPKA, RJ				PEVERLY, JH; KOPKA, RJ			CHANGES IN AL, MN AND FE FROM SEDIMENTS AND AQUATIC PLANTS AFTER LAKE DRAWDOWN	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Lake drawdown is often practiced during the winter season, causing freezing and/or drying of the sediments in order to retard subsequent rooted aquatic plant growth. In both lake and jar experiments, Zn and Mn levels in tissues of Elodea canadensis and seeded aquatic plants were elevated when grown on softwater sediments (pH 6.4) exposed to winter drawdown conditions, compared to plants grown on unexposed sediment. Dry weight production was likewise reduced by half. Sediment exchangeable acidity, and extractable Al, Zn and Mn were higher after exposure, and sediment Zn and Mn levels were highly correlated to growth (negatively) and tissue content (positively) of rooted aquatic plants. There were no consistent changes in metal concentrations of the overlying water after reflooding. It is proposed that plant growth inhibition upon reflooding is chemically mediated by increased root-available metal concentrations, found after sediment exposure and the associated oxidation of organic materials, metals, and reduced S, with release of H+ and a temporary drop in pH.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				AUG	1991	57-8						399	410		10.1007/BF00282903	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00282903													WOS:A1991GP12100042
J	Adachi, K				Adachi, Kouji			Characterization of atmospheric dry deposition particulates in Kobe, Japan	CHEMOSPHERE												The sources and character of individual metal and metalloid particles from atmospheric dry depositions in Kobe, Japan were investigated. Japan faces long-range pollutant transportation from northeastern Asia during winter and spring. Information regarding their properties and sources is useful for evaluating their affects on the environment and human health. Individual metal and metalloid particles that were collected for every 24 h on the plate, which was designed to reduce a local turbulence, were characterized for their composition, diameter, and deposition fluxes using a field emission scanning electron microscope with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer. Approximately 3000 metal and metalloid particles were classified into 14 types based on their composition and further classified into four groups based on their distribution patterns. They are (A) Fe-O, Fe-Ba-Sb-Cu-S-Ti-O, Fe-Zn-O, Zn-O, Ni-O, and Mn-Fe-O; (B) Cu-Zn-O and Cu-Sn-O; (C) Pb-O, Sn-Sb-O, and Ag-O; (D) Pb-Zn-Cl-Si-S-O and Bi-Cl-O. From these data, this study suggests their sources as the Asian continent (Group A), local source (Group 13), multiple sources (Group C), and incineration process (Group D). This study shows (1) the sources and character of individual metal and metalloid particles from short-term atmospheric depositions in Kobe, Japan and (2) application of individual particle analysis for atmospheric depositions.

J	RIDLEY, AM; COVENTRY, DR				RIDLEY, AM; COVENTRY, DR			YIELD RESPONSES TO LIME OF PHALARIS, COCKSFOOT, AND ANNUAL PASTURES IN NORTH-EASTERN VICTORIA	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												Yield responses of 3 mixed grass-clover pastures [Phalaris aquatica L. cv. Sirosa (phalaris), Dactylis glomerata cv. Porto (cocksfoot), and annual grass based Trifolium subterraneum L. cv. Trikkala (subterranean clover) pastures] were measured over 5 soil pH treatments at 2 sites in Victoria. One site (Beechworth) was strongly acidic [pH(CaCl2) less-than-or-equal-to 4.2] to a depth of 40 cm and contained high concentrations of soil aluminium (Al). At the other site (Lake Rowan), yield responses to lime application had been measured previously, but only in Al-sensitive wheat cultivars. At Beechworth, pasture yield responses to lime were not consistent but, when observed, occur-red in autumn and winter in all 3 pasture types. Phalaris pastures showed yield increases more often than cocksfoot and annual pastures. Low magnesium and calcium concentrations may have limited dry matter production, although yields were reasonable on all treatments. Where lime was applied, growth responses may have been due to alleviation of Al toxicity. At Beechworth, pasture yield was increased where lime increased pH from 4.2 to 4.6 and decreased soil Al (measured in 10 mmol CaCl2/l) from 11 to <3 mug/g soil. Herbage manganese concentrations were not high in phalaris and subterranean clover, and cocksfoot manganese standards were not available. At Lake Rowan (pH 4.7, Al <1 mug/g), no growth responses to lime were seen in any pasture treatment, and annual grass based pastures sometimes had higher yields than phalaris and cocksfoot pastures. On strongly acidic soils such as at Beechworth, incorporation of lime prior to pasture establishment should be considered. Perennial grasses may reduce further soil degradation through acidification. Soil Al concentrations are commonly lower in ley-cropping areas, and the inclusion of perennial grasses in ley pastures requires further evaluation.																			0816-1089						1992	32	8					1061	1068		10.1071/EA9921061	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/EA9921061													WOS:A1992KU62200010

Influenced on the different regional/local environments, the contributions of recycled moisture to precipitation present as different proportions. Recycled moisture has an important impact on the hydrological cycle, further occurred a series of environmental effect for regional/local. Aimed to estimate the contribution of recycled moisture to precipitation in an enclosed basin, Guanzhong Basin of northern China, precipitation and lake/reservoir samples were collected. The isotope ratio analysis was done for the summer season, and a three-component mixing model based on the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes was applied. The results indicated that the averaged contribution of recycled moisture to precipitation was 17.44% in Guanzhong Basin of northern China, while the mean proportions of surface evaporation moisture and transpiration moisture were found to be 0.38% and 16.97%, respectively. Comparatively, most of the recycled moisture mainly comes from transpiration moisture rather than evaporation moisture, suggesting that transpiration moisture from cropland, vegetation, and plants instead of evaporation is dominant in moisture recycling of the Guanzhong Basin.					; Tripathee, Lekhendra/T-4350-2019; Li, xiaofei/GXF-7187-2022; Junji, Cao/D-3259-2014; LI, ZHI/D-7204-2015; Wang, Xiaoyan/IQU-1588-2023	Wang, Shengjie/0000-0001-8095-2674; Cao, Junji/0000-0003-1000-7241; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2020	27	22			SI		27926	27936		10.1007/s11356-020-09099-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09099-z		MAY 2020						32405940					WOS:000532643300012

Nutrient enrichment experiments conducted in situ in June and August, 2007 and 2008, determined responses in phytoplankton biomass, Microcystis abundance and microcystin concentration to additions of phosphorus and different forms of nitrogen (NH4+, NO3, and urea). Microcystis abundance was determined using quantitative PCR targeting the phycocyanin intergenic spacer cpcBA. Total phytoplankton biomass increased with additions of N both before and during Microcystis blooms, with no primary effects from P, suggesting overall N limitation for phytoplankton growth during the summer season. NH4_+ generally produced the greatest response in phytoplankton growth, while Microcystis abundance increased in response to all forms of N. Microcystis doubling time in the in situ experiments was 1.24-1.39 days when N was not limiting growth. The results from this study suggest availability of N during the summer is a key growth-limiting factor for the initiation and maintenance of toxic Microcystis blooms in Copco and Iron Gate Reservoirs in the Klamath River.

Under the crater lake a vapor-liquid coexisting region is expected based on the chemistry of crater lake and isotopic ratios of lake water. Based on the chemical composition of the acidic hot spring waters and fumarole, the area of Kusatsu-Shirane volcano is divided into three districts. The variation in the chemistry of gas and water may suggest an individual source of the fluids for each district.																					90-2651-824-2				2001							891	893																WOS:000172263500207

We investigated B. dodgei's growth in laboratory cultures and related results to their implication for bloom formation. B. dodgei was cultivated under different temperature, nutrient and light conditions. Growth rates, cell biovolume, cyst formation and pigment and mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) concentrations were determined. Experiments showed that this alga (i) had higher growth rates at low temperatures (< 7A degrees C) and high irradiance levels (similar to 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), (ii) produced higher yields with organic supplements such as peptone, (iii) did not grow in the dark even with organic supplements, (iv) survived for long periods without a light source, (v) synthesised MAAs, (vi) showed an increase in cell volume with nutrient shortage and increasing temperatures (> 7A degrees C) and (vii) had high encystment rates with temperatures > 7A degrees C. These laboratory fingerprints allowed us to construct a theoretical model defining the species' niche. Borghiella needed a mixture of low temperatures, high irradiance levels and sufficient quantities of dissolved organic nitrogen to form blooms. Such a strict combination was probably a transient situation and occurred in oligotrophic Lake Tovel only in early summers followed by heavy spring rains.

RESOLUTION AND ANALYSIS OF SPATIAL VARIATIONS AND PATTERNS IN AN URBAN LAKE WITH RAPID PROFILING INSTRUMENTATION	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Rapid response vertical profiling instrumentation was used to document spatial variability and patterns in a small urban lake, Onondaga Lake, associated with multiple drivers. Paired profiles of temperature, specific conductance (SC), turbidity (T-n), fluorometric chlorophyll a (Chl(f)), and nitrate nitrogen (NO3-) were collected at >30 fixed locations (a gridding) weekly, over the spring to fall interval of several years. These gridding data are analyzed (1) to characterize phytoplankton (Chl(f)) patchiness in the lake's upper waters, (2) to establish the representativeness of a single long-term site for monitoring lake-wide conditions, and (3) to resolve spatial patterns of multiple tracers imparted by buoyancy effects of inflows. Multiple buoyancy signatures were resolved, including overflows from less dense inflows, and interflows to metalimnetic depths and underflows to the bottom from the plunging of more dense inputs. Three different metrics had utility as tracers in depicting the buoyancy signatures as follows: (1) SC, for salinity-enriched tributaries and the more dilute river that receives the lake's outflow, (2) T-n, for the tributaries during runoff events, and (3) NO3-, for the effluent of a domestic waste treatment facility and from the addition of NO3- solution to control methyl mercury. The plunging inflow phenomenon, which frequently prevailed, has important management implications.

Needed: Early-term adjustments for Lake Erie phosphorus target loads to address western basin cyanobacterial blooms	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												For Lake Erie, it is already time to revise the phosphorus target loads set to address the problem of cyanobacterial blooms in the Western Basin. Current targets were proposed by the Annex 4 task group in 2015, adopted by U.S. and Canadian governments in 2016, and set as objectives of domestic action plans in 2017. These targets, applicable to all spring discharges below the 90th percentile, set a maximum load for both total phosphorus (TP) and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) equivalent to 60% of their 2008 spring loads. This essentially mandates 40% reductions in both particulate phosphorus (PP) and DRP loading relative to 2008 loads. These targets do not explicitly incorporate the difference in bioavailability between DRP (similar to 100% bioavailable) and PP (similar to 25% bioavailable). From 2008 to 2017, DRP comprised 24% of the spring TP load and over half (similar to 56%) of the total bioavailable phosphorus (TBAP) load, while PP comprised 76% of the TP load but only similar to 44% of the TBAP load. Subsequent deposition of PP in the estuarine and nearshore zones further reduces its significance in bloom development. By ignoring differences in bioavailability, the current targets provide no guidance for choosing among practices based on their relative effectiveness in reducing DRP or PP and their combined reductions in TBAP loading. Current targets place more emphasis on PP than needed to efficiently reach targeted cyanobacterial bloom reductions. To clarify appropriate management approaches and lead to greater success in reducing cyanobacterial blooms, target loads should be based on TBAP. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Neogene and Pleistocene landslides along the Grand Valley fault in eastern Idaho and western Wyoming, USA, and their relationship to caldera-forming eruptions of the Yellowstone hotspot	GEOSPHERE												Caldera-forming eruptions from the Yellowstone hotspot (western USA) have been some of the most destructive geologic events in Earth's history. These large-scale eruptions appear to be coincident with numerous large mass-wasting deposits that contribute to valley-fill sequences adjacent to the Yellowstone hotspot. Within the Mio-Pliocene Salt Lake Formation and the Pleistocene Long Spring Formation, at least 20-21 landslide deposits are exposed over a distance of 65 km from Irwin, Idaho, to Bedford, Wyoming. The majority of these deposits are remarkably similar and exhibit characteristics of either rock-avalanche or brecciated slide-block deposits that form as a result of catastrophic, large-volume (>1 Mm(3)) rock falls and slides. A stratigraphic framework was constructed in the area of Grand Valley to determine the relative position of the landslides and estimate their ages. Interbedded tephra deposits originating from the volcanic fields to the northwest provide key marker beds. Five new Ar-40/Ar-39 ages were determined, including the first age for a tephra deposit in Star Valley, to aid the correlation of outcrops in Grand Valley and between Grand Valley and Star Valley. The age of these ash deposits better defines the formation and evolution of the Grand Valley-Star Valley fault. Our detailed correlations and mapping have resulted in the identification of 11 different stratigraphic horizons containing landslide deposits; intervening ash beds allow us to approximate the timing of these landslides. The oldest landslide in Grand Valley occurred ca. 9 Ma and coincides with eruptions from the Twin Falls volcanic field. We identify six additional landslide horizons between 6.66 Ma and 4.0 Ma, one horizon between 4.0 Ma and 2.1 Ma, two horizons between 2.1 Ma and 0.6 Ma, and one landslide in the Late Pleistocene (<130 ka). The correlation of the various landslide deposits and the broader stratigraphic framework suggest that most of these landslides are coincident with the caldera-forming ignimbrite eruptions associated with the volcanic fields of the Yellowstone hotspot.																			1553-040X					OCT	2025	21	5								10.1130/GES02790.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/GES02790.1		AUG 2025											WOS:001554350000001

Quantification of the relationships between wetland hydrological attributes and waterbirds distribution is critical for the success of waterbird conservation. In this study, flood duration (FD) derived from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery was combined with geese GPS tracking data to quantify the optimal FD thresholds for identifying geese habitats. Based on the thresholds, we defined the suitable habitats of wintering geese and investigated the difference in the spatial distribution pattern of habitat from 2018 to 2020 in Poyang Lake, China. We also considered the role of sub-lakes in habitat protection. The results showed that the area of suitable habitats for wintering geese decreased in both dry and wet years, and the range of optimal FD threshold was wider in normal years than in both dry and wet years. The proportion of suitable habitats per unit area was greater in the sub-lakes than in the whole Poyang Lake. We concluded that FD indices extracted from SAR data are valuable for reflecting the influence of the pattern of hydrological variation on waterbird distribution and for the protection and rational use of wetland ecosystems.					; Yu, Xiubo/A-5875-2016	Liu, Yu/0000-0002-1692-1811; Teng, Jiakun/0000-0001-9207-3765														2072-4292				FEB	2022	14	4							952	10.3390/rs14040952	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14040952													WOS:000821669100001
J	Mezquita, F; Hernández, R; Rueda, J				Mezquita, F; Hernández, R; Rueda, J			Ecology and distribution of ostracods in a polluted Mediterranean river	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY					13th International Symposium on Ostracoda (ISO97)	JUL, 1997	UNIV GREENWICH MEDWAY CAMPUS, KENT, ENGLAND		UNIV GREENWICH MEDWAY CAMPUS			The present survey examines possible trends in the ecology of ostracod assemblages in a small Mediterranean river affected heavily by sewage and industrial effluents. Between January and July 1995, ten sampling stations situated along a 50 km stretch of the main channel of the River Magre (Valencia, eastern Iberian Peninsula) were sampled monthly (physico-chemical variables being measured simultaneously). Although the entire sire fauna was used to calculate diversity and biotic indexes, only Ostracoda were studied in depth, as little is known of the ecological preferences of this group. Ostracod assemblages encompassed 10 species, the most abundant genera being Herpetocypris and Heterocypris. Most species peaked in abundance towards the end of the study period (May-June) when water temperatures were rising. Ostracods were completely absent from the most disturbed sites, i.e. those with the lowest water quality index values. Different ostracod assemblages occurred along a gradient from high pollution towards the final 'recovery' zone. Combined classification (TWINSPAN, MDA) and ordination (DCA) techniques using species and site variable data showed that different groups of samples, related to the abundance of a particular ostracod assemblage, were linked to particular habitat features. Eucypris virens appeared in samples near to the source in winter, and in the early months of spring. During this period these sites were characterised by cool waters and relatively high alkalinity/Cl- ratios. Furthermore two major groups of samples were related to the relative abundance of either Heterocypris incongruens and Herpetocypris intermedia, or Herpetocypris brevicaudata. Moderately polluted, clean waters are linked to these two groups, respectively. Additional division of both groups of samples was based on the total abundance of individual animals, and may be related to water temperature and season. These results may be used to assess possible changes in the trophic status of a palaeoenvironment when the species taken into account are recorded from a given sedimentary sequence.

J	Nevalainen, L				Nevalainen, Liisa			Parthenogenesis and gamogenesis in seasonal succession of chydorids (Crustacea, Chydoridae) in three low-productive lakes as observed with activity traps	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The aim of the present study was to determine the variance in abundance of parthenogenetic (asexual) and gamogenetic (sexual) individuals among chydorids (Crustacea, Anomopoda, Chydoridae). The chydorids were monitored quantitatively with stationary activity traps in three lakes in southern Finland at 2-week intervals during the open-water season (early May-late October) in 2006. The lakes chosen for the study were low-productive forest lakes; Lake Kalatoin was dystrophic fish-free lake and lakes Tuhkuri and Iso Lehmalampi were oli-gotrophic. The abundance of trapped individuals varied widely among the lakes and during the sampling period presumably due to site-specific environmental conditions (available microhabitats, food, shelter). The abundance was highest in the dystrophic Lake Kalatoin (max. 43 x 10(3) m(-2) trapday(-1) in June) and clearly lower in the two oligotrophic lakes (max. 8.5 x 10(3) m(-2) trapday(-1) in Lake Tuhkuri in mid-July and max. 2.2 x 10(3) m(-2) trapday(-1) in Lake Iso Lehmalampi in mid-October). The chydorids exhibited unique sexual reproduction patterns among sampling sites and populations as the abundance of trapped gamogenetic individuals differed, suggesting habitat and population-specific patterns in gamogenesis. In lakes Kalatoin and Iso Lehmalampi gamogenetic individuals were caught in the traps during the autumn with maxima of 2.2 and 1.6 x 10(3) m(-2) trapday(-1), respectively, but in Lake Tuhkuri no gamogenetic individuals were encountered during the autumn. Although Alonella nana (Baird) was most abundantly trapped species in all the lakes, its gamogenetic individuals were trapped numerously only in Lake Kalatoin (max. ca. 1.5 x 10(3) m(-1) trapday(-1)). The results suggest that gamogenesis in chydorids is a more complex phenomenon than previously believed.

Comparison of histological features, and description of histopathological lesions in thyroid glands from three species of free-ranging sharks from the northwestern Atlantic, the blue shark, Prionace glauca (L.), the shortfin mako, Isurus oxyrhinchus Rafinesque, and the thresher, Alopias vulpinus (Bonnaterre)	JOURNAL OF FISH DISEASES												Histomorphological features of piscine thyroids are widely accepted and frequently used as bioindicators of environmental pollution. This despite the fact that there is marked variation in thyroid morphology resulting from numerous pathological and physiological conditions. Our hypothesis was that there will be variations in histological features in thyroids collected from different shark species during the summer season in the northwestern Atlantic. To test our hypothesis, we examined histological features encountered in grossly normal thyroids from three species of sharks, the shortfin mako, Isurus oxyrhinchus, thresher, Alopias vulpinus and blue sharks, Prionace glauca. In addition, microscopic lesions from these thyroids were described. Ninety-four sharks were collected in summer 2001, 2002 and 2004. Routine, haematoxylin and eosin-stained paraffin-embedded sections were studied by light microscopy. We found inter-species but not intra-species variation in histological patterns of thyroids, which were distinct enough to allow 'blind' assignment of a thyroid to the specific species. The most common lesions encountered were lymphofollicular hyperplasia and chronic thyroiditis. In addition, one case each of intravascular larval nematodes and a myxosporean infection was found. Our results provide the first data on species-specific morphology of thyroids collected during summer months from sharks. The results indicate that familiarity with normal thyroid morphology is crucial before using shark thyroids in biomonitoring of environmental contamination or interpreting data from this gland in shark-health studies.																			0140-7775	1365-2761				SEP	2009	32	9					785	793		10.1111/j.1365-2761.2009.01056.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2761.2009.01056.x								19531095					WOS:000268970200006

We present records of the stable carbon isotope composition of bulk organic matter (delta C-13(org)), magnetic parameters, and sediment color, from five loess-paleosol sequences in NE Iran, in western ACA, with the aim of reconstructing Holocene precipitation. The Yellibadragh (YE) section (the thickest among the five sequences) was selected for optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of the coarse-grained quartz (63-90 mu m) fraction, and its delta C-13(org) record was used to quantitatively reconstruct mean annual precipitation (MAP). The record indicates a dry early Holocene (similar to 11.8-7.4 ka), with nearly constant MAP (similar to 93 mm), followed by a wetting trend from the mid-Holocene (similar to 7.4 ka) onward, with the wettest period in the late Holocene (similar to 4.0-0.0 ka, similar to 390 mm). The stratigraphic observations and environmental proxies support the reconstruction. The other loess profiles show stratigraphic features and trends of environmental proxies, which are similar to those of the YE profile. A dry early Holocene and wetting trend since the mid-Holocene, with the wettest climate in the late Holocene in NE Iran, are both consistent with records from sand dunes and lake sediments from adjacent areas, and with loess records from central and eastern ACA. Comparison with loess records from monsoonal Asia supports the interpretation of a "westerly-dominated climatic regime," which was proposed mainly on the basis of lake sediment records from the region. Changes in solar insolation may have been responsible for the persistent wetting trend during the Holocene in western ACA.					; Wang, Qiang/F-1131-2010; Fahu, Chen/B-2788-2011; Chen, Jianhui/A-5340-2011; wang, leibin/HKE-2120-2023; Khormali, Farhad/AAA-8236-2020; Huang, Wei/W-5743-2018	Xie, Haichao/0000-0002-3035-4526; Chen, Fahu/0000-0002-8874-1035; Chen, Jianhui/0000-0002-6768-1619; 														1525-2027				MAR	2020	21	3							e2019GC008616	10.1029/2019GC008616	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019GC008616													WOS:000534469900012

Use of molecular markers as indicators for winter zooplankton grazing on toxic benthic cyanobacteria colonies in an urban Colorado lake	HARMFUL ALGAE												Laboratory experiments provide no general answer to the question of whether zooplankton affects cyanobacteria or are affected by prokaryotes. A cyanobacterium may be grazed upon as small colonies, and the same species, as larger colonies, may inhibit zooplankton feeding. Within zooplankton, different species or groups may be affected differently. With this background we set out to detect winter zooplankton grazing and toxicity of overwintering populations of Microcystis aeruginosa. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method with oligonucleotide primers for the mcy gene cluster that encodes microcystin synthetase was employed for detection of M. aeruginosa reminiscent products in grazing cladocera. In our field studies, we detected the mcy gene cluster in strains of overwintering colonies of benthic Microcystis and also confirmed the expression of toxicity by quantitative PCR, phosphatase inhibition and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). We further confirmed the presence of the mcy gene cluster in DNA and RNA isolated from sampled Daphnia magna specimens, indicating that zooplankton in the natural environment may incest toxic Microcystis cells as part of their diet during winter months.

J	CORDONE, AJ; FRANTZ, TC				CORDONE, AJ; FRANTZ, TC			LAKE TAHOE SPORT FISHERY	CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME												Lake Tahoe is a deep, cold, extremely oligotrophic lake located in the Sierra Nevada of California and Nevada. Tahoe anglers can be divided into 4 distinct categories: topline, deepline, shore, and pier anglers. These groups had dissimilar success rates and catch compositions. In terms of the lake''s natural fishery, deepliners had the highest and most consistent success and caught lake trout almost exclusively. Topline success was next, with the catch composed primarily of wild rainbow trout, followed by lake trout and then brown trout. Pier anglers were the next most successful group and took mostly wild rainbow trout, followed by mountain whitefish. Least successful were the shore anglers, who caught mostly wild rainbow trout. Planted trout increased success rates substantially, benefiting largely the shore and pier anglers and to some extent the topliners. The lake trout was the dominant game fish in the catch, comprising about 70% by number of all wild trout. Largest specimens were taken in the winter, intermediate sizes in the summer, and smallest ones in October. Estimated lake trout yield was about 0.24 lb/acre/year. A stable lake trout fishery is indicated and no changes in angling regulations are recommended. Some evidence indicates that Lake Tahoe under present conditions may be close to its potential game fish yield. On the other hand, it is possible that the yield may be increased; e.g., by more efficient utilization of potential productivity of the limnetic zone by an open-water game fish.																			0008-1078	2331-0405					1966	52	4					240	+																WOS:A19668577500002
J	Stella, JM				Stella, Juan M.			Modelling the impact of snowmelt in flows in the Mansfield Hollow Lake Watershed in Connecticut, USA	TECNOLOGIA Y CIENCIAS DEL AGUA												Storm runoff predictions are essential for minimizing flood hazards and increasing resilience to extreme weather events. In this study, an analysis was conducted to simulate snowmelt runoff in the Mansfield Hollow Lake Watershed, which is a tributary of the Thames River watershed in Connecticut, New England. The United States Army Corp of Engineers (USACE) model HEC-HMS was applied to simulate snowmelt runoff during the winter-spring of 2010 and 2019. The Mansfield Hollow Lake Watershed is composed of three main tributaries, namely the Fenton, Mount Hope, and Natchaug rivers. These runoff simulations and the watershed response to snowmelt are crucial for evaluating the potential impacts of watershed management decisions, particularly during high-flow periods. The HEC-HMS model was calibrated during the 2010 event and validated for the 2019 events. The study found that for the snow storms during 2010 and 2019 events, HEC-HMS model provided highly accurate predictions of snowmelt runoff with R-squared and, Nash-Sutcliffe correlation values exceeding 0.76. These findings highlight the efficacy of HEC-HMS model for simulating snowmelt runoff and demonstrate the utility of such model in predicting and managing flood risks. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the potential impacts of snowmelt runoff and will inform future watershed management decisions in the Mansfield Hollow Lake Watershed and similar regions.																			0187-8336	2007-2422				SEP-OCT	2025	16	5								10.24850/j-tyca-2025-05-08	http://dx.doi.org/10.24850/j-tyca-2025-05-08													WOS:001589541700008
J	Hall, DL; Willig, MR; Moorhead, DL; Sites, RW; Fish, EB; Mollhagen, TR				Hall, DL; Willig, MR; Moorhead, DL; Sites, RW; Fish, EB; Mollhagen, TR			Aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity of playa wetlands: The role of landscape and island biogeographic characteristics	WETLANDS												Wetland habitats continue to be lost at a unsettling rate, especially freshwater emergent wetlands that are isolated geographically. These are the predominant wetlands found in and and semi-arid environments, where they serve as foci of regional biodiversity. This is especially true of the playa wetlands of the Southern High Plains of Texas, USA. The factors that determine and maintain biotic diversity in these wetlands are understood poorly. Consequently, this study examined the effect of island biogeographic and landscape features on the diversity of aquatic macroinvertebrates in playa wetlands. Macroinvertebrates were collected from playas three times during the spring and summer of 1994 and categorized as resident or transient taxa based on life history strategies. Diversity was estimated using taxonomic richness (richness) and Fisher's log-series alpha (a). Surrounding land-use, practices influenced resident richness, whereas playa surface area affected resident and transient richness, as well as resident alpha. However, relationships differed among sampling dates. Regression analyses suggested that transient richness and alpha were influenced more by insular characteristics than by landscape features. The converse was true for resident richness and alpha.. Therefore, both insular and landscape characteristics affected the diversity of macroinvertebrates in playa wetlands, but impacts were dependent on life-history strategy and time since inundation (i.e., sampling date). Consequently, conservation and management efforts targeting macroinvertebrates in playa wetlands will need to focus on the wetlands and characteristics of adjacent watershed features.

S	Talling, JF		Dumont, HJ		Talling, Jack F.			Physical and Chemical Water Characteristics	NILE: ORIGIN, ENVIRONMENTS, LIMNOLOGY AND HUMAN USE	Monographiae Biologicae											An outline is given of the physical and chemical features of waters in the Nile system, including headwater lakes. Temperature is governed by the large range of latitude and altitude, and is mostly within 15-30 degrees C. Differences with depth can be appreciable under conditions of low to minimal flow and in deeper water columns. They introduce a density stratification with both diurnal and seasonal components, which influences the vertical distribution of plankton and dissolved gases. A long-lasting seasonal stratification is seen only in the deeper headwater lakes, and in Lake Nasser outside the winter season. Light penetration with depth is generally low, especially in silt-laden water associated with turbulent flow and floodwater. During water storage in reservoirs it is subject to the two opposing influences of silt deposition and phytoplankton development. Another influence, that of dispersed colour of partly organic origin accompanied by Fe enrichment, occurs during passage of water through the large Sudd swamp region. Concentrations of two gases, oxygen and carbon dioxide, are influenced by atmospheric exchange, photosynthesis of phytoplankton and submerged macrophytes, and the decomposition of organic matter, also to the limitation of vertical exchange by density stratification and mats of surface vegetation. Severe oxygen depletion at depth occurs in Lake Victoria and L. Nasser, and can affect the whole river in the Sudd swamp region. Conversely, a near-surface super-saturation of oxygen occurs by day in waters with abundant phytoplankton, conditions in which pH is often above 9.0 by the photosynthetic consumption of CO2. Otherwise pH is generally in the range 7-9. Salinity, as the total concentration of major ions, is extensively documented by electrical conductivity. It is strongly reduced in floodwater, but otherwise tends to increase downstream. In Egypt there are instances of relatively high salinity, induced mainly by evaporation in some laterally derived water-bodies (e.g. L. Qarun) or by the influx of seawater in some Delta lakes. The Blue and White Niles differ in cationic composition, the divalent ions Ca2+ and Mg2+ being predominant in the former and the monovalent ions Na+ and K+ in the latter - for which river there is a large and variable contribution from Lake Albert. The HCO3-/CO32- complex (summed as titration alkalinity) is dominant among anions, is closely correlated with conductivity, and falls to low levels only in parts of the Sudd swamps. Longitudinal and seasonal surveys have shown much variation in the major plant nutrients PO4-P, NO3-N, NH4-N and Si. A major input of PO4-P comes from the contribution of Lake Albert. Chemical exchanges between silt and water are likely to be important, with relevance for bacterial and algal communities. Floodwater is generally with considerable concentrations of these nutrients, especially NO3-N. Subsequent falls reflect the changing character of drainage and consumption in the seasonal and spatial abundance of phytoplankton. These changes have been closely documented for the White and Blue Niles near Khartoum.																			0077-0639		978-1-4020-9725-6				2009	89						367	394				10.1007/978-1-4020-9726-3												WOS:000270040800018

Larvae of perch (Perca fluviatilis) and roach (Rutilus rutilus) dominated in the Barther Bodden. Herring (Clupea harengus) and perch were the dominant species in the Barther Strom. Smelt (Osmerus eperlanus) was the most common species in the Elbe estuary. Sprat (Sprattus sprattus) was of most importance in the Weser estuary. The dominant prey of fish larvae were copepodids, nauplii and eggs of Eurytemora affinis. The highest food niche width was observed for nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius), ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus), three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and perch in the Barther Bodden. Negative selectivity indices indicated that populations of rotifers were scarcely influenced by predation by fish larvae. In contrast, E. affinis was preferred by early life stages of fish. Positive relationships were estimated between maximum prey lengths and predator lengths of different fish species. Key species with regard to niche overlap were nine-spined stickleback, roach, three-spined stickleback and perch in the Barther Bodden, perch and herring in the Barther Strom, herring and three-spined stickleback in the Elbe estuary, and sprat and common goby (Pomatoschistus microps) in the Weser estuary. High geographical overlap between fish species occurred in the Elbe estuary and Barther Bodden, whereas high diet overlap was estimated for both the Weser estuary and Barther Strom.

Fish were sampled during April through September 1997-1999 with seine nets and trawls and, for each sample, the habitat (physical environment) was characterized (flow, depth, substrate and inundated terrestrial vegetation). The new water bodies provide more suitable habitats for 0-group fish than the groyne fields. Their beneficial value differs, however, between reproductive guilds and depends on the morphological and hydrological conditions. Total fish density increased along a gradient of decreasing water flow whereas the proportion of rheophilic species (Barbus barbus, Gobio gobio, Leuciscus idus and Aspius aspius) decreased. Flow velocity and water depth were the most important factors determining habitat utilization. Rheophilic fish were spatially separated from eurytopic fish (e.g. Abramis brama, Rutilus rutilus and Stizostedion lucioperca). During flood events, inundated terrestrial vegetation was an important habitat for the larvae of all species. To enhance the riverine fish community, floodplain water bodies should have complex shorelines, and a high variability of flow velocities. Their slopes should be moderate to maximize the probability of terrestrial vegetation getting inundated during spring and summer. Future management of similar floodplains should focus on more diverse and accessible aquatic habitats to increase overall fish species diversity, since different types of water body clearly have complementary values.

Walter			Vertical mixing within the epilimnion modulates UVR-induced photoinhibition in tropical freshwater phytoplankton from southern China	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The importance of vertical mixing in modulating the impact of UVR on phytoplankton photosynthesis was assessed in a tropical, shallow lake in southern China from late winter to mid-spring of 2005. 2. Daily cycles of fluorescence measurements (i.e. photosynthetic quantum yield, Y) were performed on both 'static' and in situ samples. Static samples were of surface water incubated at the surface of the lake under three radiation treatments - PAB (PAR + UVR, 280-700 nm), PA (PAR + UV-A, 320-700 nm) and P (PAR, 400-700 nm). In situ samples were collected every hour at three different depths - 0, 0.5 and 1 m. 3. The general daily pattern was of a significant decrease in Y from early morning towards noon, with partial recovery in the afternoon. Samples incubated under static conditions always had lower Y than those under in situ conditions at the same time of the day. 4. Under stratified conditions, no overall impact of UVR impact could be detected in situ when compared with the static samples. Further rapid vertical mixing not only counteracted the impact of UVR but also stimulated photosynthetic efficiency. 5. Based on these measurements of fluorescence, the mixing speed of cells moving within the epilimnion was estimated to range between 0.53 and 6.5 cm min(-1). 6. These data show that mixing is very important in modulating the photosynthetic response of phytoplankton exposed to natural radiation and, hence, strongly conditions the overall impact of UVR on aquatic ecosystems.					gao, kunshan/G-3374-2010	Gao, Kunshan/0000-0001-7365-6332; Villafane, Virginia/0000-0002-9552-6069													0046-5070					JUL	2007	52	7					1260	1270		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01762.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01762.x													WOS:000247127200007

Hillslope water tracks in the High Arctic: Seasonal flow dynamics with changing water sources in preferential flow paths	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Preferential subsurface flow paths known as water tracks are often the principal hydrological pathways of headwater catchments in permafrost areas, exerting an influence on slope physical and biogeochemical processes. In polar deserts, where water resources depend on snow redistribution, water tracks are mostly found in hydrologically active areas downslope from snowdrifts. Here, we measured the flow through seeping water track networks and at the front of a perennial snowdrift, at Ward Hunt Island in the Canadian High Arctic. We also used stable isotope analysis to determine the origin of this water, which ultimately discharges into Ward Hunt Lake. These measurements of water track hydrology indicated a glacio-nival run-off regime, with flow production mechanisms that included saturation overland flow (return flow) in a low sloping area, throughflow or pipe-like flow in most seepage locations, and infiltration excess overland flow at the front of the snowdrift. Each mechanism delivered varying proportions of snowmelt and ground water, and isotopic compositions evolved during the melting season. Unaltered snowmelt water contributed to >90% of total flow from water track networks early in the season, and these values fell to <5% towards the end of the melting season. In contrast, infiltration excess overland flow from snowdrift consisted of a steady percentage of snowmelt water in July (mean of 69%) and August (71%). The water seeping at locations where no snow was left in August 2015 was isotopically enriched, indicating a contribution of the upper, ice-rich layer of permafrost to late summer discharge during warmer years. Air temperature was the main driver of snowmelt, but the effect of slope aspect on solar radiation best explained the diurnal discharge variation at all sites. The water tracks in this polar desert are part of a patterned ground network, which increases connectivity between the principal water sources (snowdrifts) and the bottom of the slope. This would reduce soil-water interactions and solute release, thereby favouring the low nutrient status of the lake.					; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019; Fortier, Daniel/E-6965-2016	Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; Fortier, Daniel/0000-0003-0908-6157													0885-6087	1099-1085				APR 15	2018	32	8					1077	1089		10.1002/hyp.11483	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.11483													WOS:000430466700007

However, in many areas, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) dominates the carbon export from catchments. Owing to different production processes and turnover times of organic versus inorganic carbon, CO2 emitted from rivers and lakes may have different impacts on global carbon cycling depending on its origin. Here, pCO(2) and dissolved oxygen concentrations were determined, and the ratios of excess CO2 to O-2 depletion (Delta CO2/Delta O-2) were compared in spring water, river water and lake water in a carbonate catchment located in the southwestern plateau region of China. Results show that groundwater CO2 evasion, at 2.0 g C m(-2)year(-1), is insignificant in terms of terrestrial carbon loss compared with soil CO2 emission. In the rivers, calcite precipitation due to oversaturation is an important mechanism for CO2 production in some seasons. In the lake, HCO3 (-) contributed approximately 75 % of the total carbon supply to organic matter production and calcite deposition during seasons favoring photosynthesis. The seasons which had high Delta CO2/Delta O-2 are the main periods of CO2 emission from the lake, and the extra CO2 may be produced from HCO3 (-) titration by H+. Thus, lake CO2 evasion was controlled primarily by pH, not respiration. The spring, river, and lake waters mainly process DIC exported from the catchment, of which HCO3 (-) is primarily derived from carbonate weathering by soil CO2 that, with extraordinarily high Delta CO2/Delta O-2, may originate from sources including organic matter decomposition, root respiration (autotrophic), and acid dissolution. Therefore, freshwater CO2 emission is a return pathway of catchment soil CO2 to the atmosphere more than that of net primary production and net ecosystem production.

Modelling ice cover formation of a lake-river system with exceptionally high flows (Lake St. Martin and Dauphin River, Manitoba)	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												In 2011, Manitoba experienced extreme flooding on a wide extended scale that affected many large watersheds, in particular the Upper Assiniboine, Qu'Appelle and Souris River watersheds. In order to protect Winnipeg from excessive flooding, some of the flood waters were diverted via the Portage Diversion into Lake Manitoba and Lake St. Martin, causing extreme high water levels and flooding of these lakes. The outlet of this entire drainage basin is the Dauphin River Rowing from Lake St. Martin to Lake Winnipeg. The river's conveyance capacity was exceeded by the flood and the lakes could not be drained fast enough to avoid damage from high flood levels and shore line erosion and property damage from accentuated wind setup (seiche) and wave uprush (runup) of the lake water. An Emergency Channel was constructed to compensate for this constriction, which now conveys additional water from Lake St. Martin towards lake Winnipeg. Due to the extreme flooding, the Dauphin River had unprecedented record flows in the autumn of 2011. Ice cover formation during winter freeze-up of these waters could potentially exacerbate the flooding situation for communities alongside Lake St. Martin and the Dauphin River. Hence, the river ice model RIVICE was implemented to determine flood protection elevations to which existing dikes needed to be raised and extended. The modelling takes into consideration the potential frazil ice generation that can raise water levels by up to 3 m from open water levels. High discharge and water level data was available to calibrate the model both for an open-water and an ice-covered case. Three scenarios were then simulated to determine ice-covered water levels of the river for early, best-estimate and late freeze-up events to determine flood protection levels along the Dauphin River and lake St. Martin. The model was successfully validated using data collected during a freeze-up event in December 2011. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We evaluated the influences of distinct periods of hydrological connectivity on the phytoplankton community structure itsetf but also interferences with biotic processes (including community succession, competition and zooplankton grazing) that may take place within the constraints set by the hydrological disturbance regime. Algal biomass was highly related to the hydrological regime: lowest amounts were detected either during flood events or at long-lasting periods of isolation; on the other hand intermediate connection led to maximum concentrations. During floods and throughout the cold season, Bacillariophyceae were dominating the algal community. Summer and elongated periods of isolation favoured Chlorophyta. Cryptophyta occurred in early autumn after two months disconnection from the main channel, Dinophyta and Cyanoprokaryota were only of minor importance. Multivariate statistical analyses showed that water age was the primary determinant of phytoplankton community, structure in the side-arm system. Cluster analyses revealed 7 groups that were characterized by 169 indicator taxa. Groups were dominated 15); Bacillariophyceae (Nitzschia, Navicula, Cymbella, Fragilaria and Diatoma), while species belonging to the Chloro-, Eugleno- and Dinophyta were less abundant. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling was used for a comparison of community similarity between the main channel and the side-arm system. During high connectivity temporal trends of phytoplankton similarity in the side-arm tracked closely the community patterns of the Danube which indicated a major influence of the main channel on phytoplankton community structure. During low connectivity the temporal trends of the communities from both sampling stations were less coupled. A Canonical Correspondence Analysis explained 89.7% of the Variance of the species-environment relation. Water age, particulate inorganic matter and dissolved inorganic nitrogen compounds were strongly coinciding with the first axis, whereas particulate nitrogen was mainly related to the second a:vis. A phytoplankton succession model was developed for the side-arm system. This model emphasizes increased phytoplankton community similarity during high connectivity and short isolation periods and a site-specific community development during low connectivity between the Danube and the side-arm. During prolonged isolation. seasonality gained importance in structuring the plankton Community. Biotic interaction (intraguild competition and zooplankton grazing) played an important role in the shifts between successional stages, suggesting that these effects should not be neglected in ecological studies of disturbance-dependent floodplain ecosystems.

J	Giresse, P; Maley, J; Kossoni, A				Giresse, P; Maley, J; Kossoni, A			Sedimentary environmental changes and millennial climatic variability in a tropical shallow lake (Lake Ossa, Cameroon) during the Holocene	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The Holocene environmental evolution of the shallow Ossa lacustrine complex in Cameroon is analysed on the basis of the present-day sedimentary dynamics and, principally, by the study of five well-dated cores. Sediment accumulation rates, lithofacies and mineral content changes and various tracers of flux provenance are considered in connection with the pollen data. At the shallower sites (1-2-m-water depth during the dry season), a moderate rise in lake level may have induced the transition from hydromorphic marshy conditions (gleys) to lacustrine conditions (muds) ca. 8000 cal BP at the easternmost site. A moderate fall may have generated the opposite process, ca. 7000 cal BP in the near northern part. A marked decrease in sediment accumulation rate between 5000 and 3000 cal BP is apparent in some cores, coinciding with an increasing discontinuity of the particulate supply. During this interval, the weakening of monsoon rainfall is associated to an increasingly seasonal regime characterized by lower and sporadic fluxes. This decrease corresponds to a northern shift of "equatorial" climatic conditions with the main dry season occurring during the boreal summer. During the time interval between ca. 2800 and 2000 cal BP, the return of "tropical" climatic conditions induced the opening of the vegetation associated with more intensive erosion. Increasing Cyperaceae may indicate flooding of areas suitable for colonisation until 2800 cal BP. The first overflow of the Sanaga River into Lake Ossa occurred after ca. 5800 cal BP with a NE-SW depositional axis of coarse material. Transport of suspended matter in the surface waters northward was probably induced by prevailing SW winds. The timing of this climatic evolution is independently supported by other lake sediment records from the forest domain of West Africa and can be compared with other cyclical phenomena, such as Bond and Dansgaard-Oeschger, as well as solar oscillations.

The process of in situ lake sampling remains the primary choice to comprehensively understand an aquatic ecosystem at local scales; however, the impact of climate change on lakes necessitates the rapid advancement of understanding and the incorporation of lakes on both landscape and global scales. Three fields driving innovation within winter limnology that we address here are autonomous real-time in situ monitoring, remote sensing, and modeling. The recent progress in low-power in situ sensing and data telemetry allows continuous tracing of under-ice processes in selected lakes as well as the development of global lake observational networks. Remote sensing offers consistent monitoring of numerous systems, allowing limnologists to ask certain questions across large scales. Models are advancing and historically come in different types (process-based or statistical data-driven), with the recent technological advancements and integration of machine learning and hybrid process-based/statistical models. Lake ice modeling enhances our understanding of lake dynamics and allows for projections under future climate warming scenarios. To encourage the merging of technological innovation within limnological research of the less-studied winter period, we have accumulated both essential details on the history and uses of contemporary sampling, remote sensing, and modeling techniques. We crafted 100 questions in the field of winter limnology that aim to facilitate the cross-pollination of intensive and extensive modes of study to broaden knowledge of the winter period.					; Robertson, Dale/O-1913-2018; Steele, B/LWI-9872-2024; Anderson, Eric/JYO-8924-2024; Tom, Manu/ABV-9231-2022; Culpepper, Joshua/ITV-3885-2023; Piccolroaz, Sebastiano/AAJ-7627-2021; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa/Y-6135-2019; Duguay, Claude/G-5682-2011; Kirillin, Georgiy/B-5410-2010; Long, Di/N-8049-2013; Magee, Madeline/ITW-0614-2023	Anderson, Eric/0000-0001-5342-8383; Ladwig, Robert/0000-0001-8443-1999; Tom, Manu/0000-0002-0352-7153; Meyer, Michael/0000-0002-8034-9434; Dolan, Wayana/0000-0001-8405-4302; Arp, Christopher/0000-0002-6485-6225; Sharma, Sapna/0000-0003-4571-2768; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				MAY	2025	61	5							e2024WR039042	10.1029/2024WR039042	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024WR039042													WOS:001480433100001

The Plitvice Lakes are a unique and complex karst lakes system consisting of 16 flow-through lakes connected by waterfalls and streams and characterized by intense calcium carbonate precipitation in the form of tufa and lake sediments. Two main springs have different C-14 concentrations due to different geology and their variations were controlled by flow rates. Further downstream, at lakes to the Korana River that outflows from the lakes, the C-14 activity and delta C-13 consistently increased down the flow. Carbon isotope composition from 2010 to 2015 was compared with the values measured 30 years earlier. The variation in delta C-13(DIC) was accounted for seasonal change, while C-14 activity of surface water DIC decreased 7-12% during the 30 years. Using a semi-empiric model, it is calculated that the downstream increase is controlled by the exchange of DIC and atmospheric CO2 carbon and by introduction of decomposed biogenic carbon from the top soil organic matter of the lakes surrounding area in almost equal proportions.					; Bronić, Ines/I-3052-2019; Barešić, Jadranka/ABA-8529-2021	Borkovic, Damir/0000-0003-2766-0394; Krajcar Bronic, Ines/0000-0002-6534-4125; Lovrencic Mikelic, Ivanka/0000-0001-5676-5318; Baresic, Jadranka/0000-0003-4634-5859													0305-8719		978-1-78620-497-4				2021	507						149	167		10.1144/SP507-2020-49	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/SP507-2020-49													WOS:000721213100010
J	Liefert, DT; Shuman, BN				Liefert, David T.; Shuman, Bryan N.			Expression of the "4.2 ka event" in the southern Rocky Mountains, USA	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												The use of the climatic anomaly known as the "4.2 ka event" as the stratigraphic division between the middle and late Holocene has prompted debate over its impact, geographic pattern, and significance. The anomaly has primarily been described as abrupt drying in the Northern Hemisphere at ca. 4 ka (ka, thousands of years before present), but evidence of the hydroclimate change is inconsistent among sites both globally and within North America. Climate records from the southern Rocky Mountains demonstrate the challenge with diagnosing the extent and severity of the anomaly. Dune-field chronologies and a pollen record in southeastern Wyoming reveal several centuries of low moisture at around 4.2 ka, and prominent low stands in lakes in Colorado suggest the drought was unique amid Holocene variability, but detailed carbonate oxygen isotope (delta O-18(carb)) records from Colorado do not record drought at the same time. We find new evidence from delta O-18(carb) in a small mountain lake in southeastern Wyoming of an abrupt reduction in effective moisture or snowpack from approximately 4.2-4 ka, which coincides in time with the other evidence of regional drying from the southern Rocky Mountains and the western Great Plains. We find that the delta O-18(carb) in our record may reflect cool-season inputs into the lake, which do not appear to track the strong enrichment of heavy oxygen by evaporation during summer months today. The modern relationship differs from some widely applied conceptual models of lake-isotope systems and may indicate reduced winter precipitation rather than enhanced evaporation at ca. 4.2 ka. Inconsistencies among the North American records, particularly in delta O-18(carb) trends, thus show that site-specific factors can prevent identification of the patterns of multi-century drought. However, the prominence of the drought at ca. 4 ka among a growing number of sites in the North American interior suggests it was a regionally substantial climate event amid other Holocene variability.																			1814-9324	1814-9332				MAY 23	2022	18	5					1109	1124		10.5194/cp-18-1109-2022	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-18-1109-2022													WOS:000800840800001

Causes of Weather-Related Crashes in Salt Lake County, Utah	PROFESSIONAL GEOGRAPHER												In 2010, the World Health Organization declared 2011 to 2020 the Decade of Action for Road Safety in response to the enormous toll that roadway crashes take on individuals, communities, and national economies. More than 6.2 million vehicle crashes occurred in the United States in 2015, resulting in around 2.4 million injuries and more than 35,000 fatalities. Motor vehicle crashes in the United States in 2015 had an economic cost of $836 billion, equal to nearly 5 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product. For this study, more than 122,000 crashes occurring in Salt Lake County, Utah, from 2012 to 2016 were analyzed to see how weather conditions affected the number and type of crashes observed. Approximately 12 percent of crashes occurred under "adverse weather conditions." Weather-related crashes were most likely in the winter season and were very highly correlated with monthly snowfall. Although the greatest number of crashes occurred during evening rush hours, adverse weather-related crashes made up a larger percentage of crashes from 5 to 7 a.m. Although excessive speed was much more likely to be a factor in crashes during adverse weather, such crashes, on average, were less severe. Roadway slope also played a significant role, with slight increases causing more crashes.

The lake sustains a high phytoplankton biomass (up to 335 mu g l(-1) chlorophyll a) always dominated by the filamentous cyanobacteria Planktothrix agardhii. The zooplankton community was numerically dominated by rotifers and ciliates; cladocerans were rare during most of the year. The rotifer abundance was very high (up to 10(5) individual l(-1)), the bacterivorous Anuraeopsis fissa being the most abundant species. Predation rates of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) on bacteria (range: 31-130 bacteria HNF-1 h(-1)) were higher than those reported in the literature for field studies. A carbon budget showed that HNF can consume on average 91 and 76% of the bacterial carbon production in summer and winter, respectively. Bacterial turnover times are the lowest reported until now from field conditions (5 to 42 h). Consequently, bacterial carbon production was extremely high (72 to 1071 mu g C l(-1) d(-1)). Bacterial production was positively correlated to bacterial abundance but the relationship was significantly improved by the inclusion of temperature (82% variability explained). My results support the general trend for increased bacterial production with increasing trophic status, and suggest a lower energy transfer efficiency to higher trophic levels in hypertrophic lakes due to the many trophic interactions involved.

The study was carried out in 2012-2013 from the beginning of the summer stagnation period in Lake Kortowskie to complete overturn in fall. Samples of river water and ambient air were collected from two sites: near the pipeline outlet (PO) and behind the academic campus (AC). A total of 44 air samples and 44 water samples were analysed. Odour intensity was measured in samples of ambient air. The following physicochemical parameters of water were determined: flow rate, dissolved oxygen (DO), hydrogen sulphide (H2S), sulphate (SO4), ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N), total nitrogen (TN), dissolved nitrogen (DN), total particulate nitrogen (T-PN), total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total particulate organic carbon (T-POC). Water samples were also analysed to determine total bacterial abundance (TBA) and the counts of bacterial rods, cocci and spiral-shaped bacteria, and sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB). Significant variations in odour intensity were noted between years and sampling sites. Odour was significantly determined by the proportion of lake water in river water. It was also significantly correlated (P<0.01, P<0.001) with most of the analysed physicochemical and microbiological parameters. The multiple regression analysis revealed that odour intensity was influenced directly by TOC and DN and indirectly by H2S, NH4-N, TBA and counts of SRB, rod-and spiral-shaped bacteria only in.					; Wysocka, Izabela/I-6337-2012; Harnisz, Monika/N-3040-2018; Golas, Iwona/M-9260-2016; Gołaś, Iwona/O-1397-2019	Parszuto, Katarzyna/0000-0002-1373-2265; Bowszys, Magdalena/0000-0001-5760-6650; Wysocka, Izabela/0000-0003-0541-4790; Tandyrak, Renata/0000-0001-6767-6572; Harnisz, Monika/0000-0002-2907-4199; Golas, Iwona/0000-0003-3681-7277; 													1129-5767	1723-8633					2016	75	3					531	544		10.4081/jlimnol.2016.1400	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2016.1400													WOS:000385855900008

Rising mollusk bivalves from the ashes: Geologic, biostratigraphic and evolutionary implications from tuff data in the Permian Corumbatai Formation, Paran<acute accent>a Basin, Brazil	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES												During the Permian, the southwestern Gondwana margin experienced episodes of intense volcanism tied to the Choiyoi magmatism. Several ash-fall horizons related to this magmatic event are preserved within the Late Paleozoic lake-sea sedimentary record of the Paran & aacute; Basin. Furthermore, near the Permian-Triassic boundary, a meteor fell in the northern border of the basin, generating unshocked zircon grains preserved in a stratigraphic marker called the Porangaba Bed. In this study, a new U-Pb zircon age of 265.17 +/- 3.2 Ma is presented for a volcanic tuff in the upper part of the Corumbata & iacute; Formation, near the stratigraphic interval of the Porangaba Bed. In addition, Lu-Hf isotopic compositions of the zircon grains, whole-rock geochemistry, and atmospheric circulation data indicate the affinity of the ash-fall horizon with the Frontal Cordillera source. The combination of these new and previous U-Pb ages allowed us to draw a more realistic scenario of the evolution of bivalve mollusk of the Corumbata & iacute; Formation and to improve the use of these macrofossils in the biostratigraphy of the Permian succession of the Paran & aacute; Basin. In this context, we established the limits of the Pinzonella neotropica-Jacquesia brasiliensis Association Biozone between 262.38 +/- 5.7 Ma and 257.5 +/- 2.2 Ma.

The interplay between the monsoon and the Westerlies has been investigated on glacial-interglacial, millennial, and decadal scales. However, due to the scarcity of high-resolution climate records from the TP, there is a lack of information on the centennial scale, which is more closely related to the development of civilization. Here we present a decadal-resolution precipitation record covering the past similar to 3600 years from Ngamring Co in the southern TP. The record suggests the gradual weakening of the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) with multiple centennial-scale fluctuations, which are synchronous with temperature changes. Precipitation was relatively high during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and low during the Little Ice Age (LIA). A wet Roman Warm Period (RWP) and an abrupt dry spell at 2.8 ka are also identified. Comparisons suggest that an intensified Westerlies penetrated the southern TP during dry intervals, such as during the 2.8 ka event, similar to 1700-1450 cal yr BP, and the LIA; whereas an intensified monsoon prevailed during warm periods such as the MWP. The centennial-scale oscillations of precipitation in the southern TP during the late Holocene suggest the role of the Westerlies in regulating ISM moisture delivery to the region, which likely resulted from variations in the surface temperature of the North Atlantic together with solar activity.

The ability of wild animals to adapt to environmental changes has important consequences for their fitness, survival, and reproduction. Behavioural flexibility, an immediate adjustment of behaviour in response to environmental variability, may be particularly important for coping with anthropogenic change. The main aim of this study was to quantify the response of two wintering goose species (bean goose Anser fabalis and lesser white-fronted goose Anser erythropus) to poor habitat condition at population level by studying foraging behaviour. In addition, we tested whether behavioural plasticity could alter trophic niche. We characterised foraging behaviours and calculated daily home range (HR) of the geese using global positioning system tracking data. We calculated standard ellipse areas to quantify niche width using the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of individual geese. We linked behavioural plasticity with habitat quality using ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) models. We also tested the correlation between standard ellipse areas and HR using ANCOVA model. We found significant differences in geese foraging behaviours between years in their daily foraging area, travel distance and speed, and turning angle. Specifically, the birds increased their foraging area to satisfy their daily energy intake requirement in response to poor habitat conditions. They flew more sinuously and travelled faster and longer distances on a daily basis. For the endangered lesser white-fronted goose, all behaviour variables were associated with habitat quality. For bean goose, only HR and turning angle were correlated with habitat quality. The birds, especially the lesser white-fronted goose, may have had a higher trophic position under poor conditions. Our findings indicate that wintering geese showed a high degree of behavioural plasticity. However, more active foraging behaviours under poor habitat condition did not lead to a broader trophic niche. Habitat availability could be responsible to the divergent responses of foraging HR and isotopic niche to human-induced environmental change. Therefore, maintaining natural hydrological regimes during the critical period (i.e. September-November) to ensure that quality food resources are available is central to the future of populations of geese within the East Asian-Australasian Flyway.

J	Cahill, KL; Gunn, JM; Futter, MN				Cahill, KL; Gunn, JM; Futter, MN			Modelling ice cover, timing of spring stratification, and end-of-season mixing depth in small Precambrian Shield lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												From a 3-year study of 21 northern Ontario lakes, models were developed to determine the duration of ice cover, predict the timing of spring stratification, and predict the end-of-season mixing depth. The model to determine lake freeze and thaw dates was based on the daily variability of water temperature measured with a data logger suspended 1 and 2 m below the surface. The model to predict the duration of time (days) from lake thaw to lake stratification was developed using the mean May air temperature (degrees Celsius), dissolved organic carbon, and lake surface area (r(2) = 0.79). The end-of-season mixing depth was best predicted using days to stratification and dissolved organic carbon concentration (r(2) = 0.72). By applying a simple climate change scenario model, we were able to show that increased air temperature, rather than increased water clarity, was the most important factor affecting the timing of stratification. In contrast, lake clarity was the most important factor affecting end-of-season mixing depth in small Shield lakes.

Newborn V. ater were eaten by the fish Barbus barbus, Rutilus rutilus, Scardinius erythrophtalmus and Tinca tinca. Out of 137 guts of Abramis brama caught in Lake Zurich 1 contained shell fragments and an operculum of a newborn V. ater. On a 40 x 40 m grid near Goldbach, Lake Zurich, we counted 678 adult females of V. ater in June 1988, which together gave birth to approximately 13 300 offspring throughout the summer. In October we found 1348 V. ater of age class 0 on the grid, i.e. approximately 10% of the year's young had survived to the end of their first summer. The grid had been divided into two sections, A and B. In section A, 72 earthenware tiles had been placed as shelters for V. ater. Offspring survival was slightly but significantly higher here (10.9%) than in section B (9.6%). The observation that offspring survival in the natural habitat was 1 order of magnitude lower than in cages suggests that predation is an important cause of mortality of newborn V. ater. Average population density was 2 individuals m-2. There was a migration from shallow (1-4 m) to deeper water (5-9 m) in September. The average distance between weekly recordings of tagged V. ater was 4.7 m in males and 3.0 m in females.																			0029-8549	1432-1939				APR	1993	93	4					493	500		10.1007/BF00328956	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00328956								28313816					WOS:A1993KW41400005

OECOLOGIA												Mismatches between predator and prey due to climate change have now been documented for a number of systems. Ultimately, a mismatch may have far-reaching consequences for ecosystem functioning as decoupling of trophic relationships results in trophic cascades. Here, we examine the potential for climate change induced mismatches between zooplankton and algae during spring succession, with a focus on Daphnia and its algal food. Whereas the development of an overwintering population of daphnids may parallel shifts in phytoplankton phenology due to climate warming, changes in the photoperiod-temperature interaction may cause the emerging population of daphnids to hatch too late and mismatch their phytoplankton prey. A decoupling of the trophic relationship between the keystone herbivore Daphnia and its algal prey can result in the absence of a spring clear water phase. We extended an existing minimal model of seasonal dynamics of Daphnia and algae and varied the way the Daphnia population is started in spring, i.e., from free swimming individuals or from hatching resting eggs. Our model results show that temperature affects the timing of peak abundance in Daphnia and algae, and subsequently the timing of the clear water phase. When a population is started from a small inoculum of hatching resting eggs, extreme climate warming (+6 degrees C) results in a decoupling of trophic relationships and the clear water phase fails to occur. In the other scenarios, the trophic relationships between Daphnia and its algal food source remain intact. Analysis of 36 temperate lakes showed that shallow lakes have a higher potential for climate induced match-mismatches, as the probability of active overwintering daphnids decreases with lake depth. Future research should point out whether lake depth is a direct causal factor in determining the presence of active overwintering daphnids or merely indicative for underlying causal factors such as fish predation and macrophyte cover.

Fuzzy sets are suitable descriptors of ecological communities as compared to other standard algorithms and allow the description of decisions that include elements of uncertainty and vagueness. However, fuzzy sets are scarcely applied in ecology. In this work, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, fuzzy c-means and association rules mining were applied to assess the factors influencing the assemblage composition and distribution patterns of 12 zooplankton taxa in 24 shallow ponds in northern Italy. The fuzzy c-means algorithm was implemented to classify the ponds in terms of taxa they support, and to identify the influence of chemical and physical environmental features on the assemblage patterns. Data retrieved during 2014 and 2015 were compared, taking into account that 2014 late spring and summer air temperatures were much lower than historical records, whereas 2015 mean monthly air temperatures were much warmer than historical averages. In both years, fuzzy c-means show a strong clustering of ponds in two groups, contrasting sites characterized by different physico-chemical and biological features. Climatic anomalies, affecting the temperature regime, together with the main water supply to shallow ponds (e.g., surface runoff vs. groundwater) represent disturbance factors producing large interannual differences in the chemistry, biology and short-term dynamic of small aquatic ecosystems. Unsupervised machine learning algorithms and fuzzy sets may help in catching such apparently erratic differences.

The aim of the study was to determine the relationships between the sediment P and water P concentration dynamics. Samples from the uppermost 10-cm layer of the sediment and water samples from surface and near-bottom layers were collected simultaneously at six monitoring stations twice a year (in March and August) from 2004 to 2009. The results indicated that the concentrations of different P-fractions in the studied sediments varied greatly. Total P in sediment ranged from 470 to 1400 mg kg(-1) dry mass (DM), while the loosely bound (labile) P (NH4Cl-P) was the smallest and the most variable fraction (range from 3.6 to 43 mg kg(-1) DM). The metal oxide-bound P (NaOH-P) was also highly variable (range from 48 to 660 mg kg(-1) DM), whereas the concentration of calcium-bound P (HCl-P) was relatively even (range from 300 to 550 mg kg(-1) DM) in all the studied sediments. Redundancy analysis results revealed that different phosphorus fractions in sediment had statistically significant relationships with bottom-water variables like TP (in winter) and O-2 (in summer). Our results show that the oxygen conditions have deteriorated in the lake during the last decades, which may have enhanced the release of P from the sediments.					; Kangur, Kulli/H-3631-2016	Tammeorg, Olga/0000-0002-7616-3127; Kangur, Kulli/0000-0003-2484-4075													1736-4728	1736-7557				SEP	2013	62	3					171	180		10.3176/earth.2013.14	http://dx.doi.org/10.3176/earth.2013.14													WOS:000323174500005

Sedimentary geochemistry of core PG1351 from Lake El'gygytgyn - a sensitive record of climate variability in the East Siberian Arctic during the past three glacial-interglacial cycles	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The ca. 13 m long sediment core PG1351, recovered in 1998 from the central part of Lake El'gygytgyn, NE Siberia, was investigated for lithostratigraphy, water content, dry bulk density (DBD), total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total sulphur (TS) and biogenic silica (opal) contents, and for TOC stable isotope ratios (delta C-13(TOC)). The event stratigraphy recorded in major differences in sediment composition match variations in regional summer insolation, thus confirming a new age model for this core, which suggests that it spans the last 250 ka BP. Four depositional units of contrasting lithological and biogeochemical composition have been distinguished, reflecting past environmental conditions associated with relatively warm, peak warm, cold and dry, and cold but more moist climate modes. A relatively warm climate, resulting in complete summer melt of the lake ice cover and seasonal mixing of the water column, prevailed during the Holocene and Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 3, 5.1, 5.3, 6.1, 6.3, 6.5, 7.1-7.3, 7.5, 8.1 and 8.3. MIS 5.5 (Eemian) was characterized by significantly enhanced aquatic primary production and organic matter supply from the catchment, indicating peak warm conditions. During MIS 2, 5.2, 5.4, 6.2 and 6.4 the climate was cold and dry, leading to perennial lake ice cover, little regional snowfall, and a stagnant water body. A cold but more moist climate during MIS 4, 6.6, 7.4, 8.2 and 8.4 is thought to have produced more snow cover on the perennial ice, strongly reducing light penetration and biogenic primary production in the lake. While the cold-warm pattern during the past three glacial-interglacial cycles is probably controlled by changes in regional summer insolation, differences in the intensity of the warm phases and in the degree of aridity (changing snowfall) during cold phases likely were due to changes in atmospheric circulation patterns.

Research has revealed that lakes play an important role in the global carbon cycle and that they can shift between the roles of carbon sources and sinks. This study used Landsat satellite images to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics and factors influencing the CO2 changes in Chagan Lake in China. We conducted six water sampling campaigns at Chagan Lake in 2020-2021 and determined the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) from 110 water samples. Landsat surface reflectance was matched with water sampling events within +/- 7 days of satellite overpasses, yielding 75 matched pairs. A regression analysis indicated strong associations between pCO(2) and both the band difference model of the near-infrared band and green band (Band 5-Band 3, R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 27.55 mu atm) and the exponential model [((exp(b3) - exp(b5))(2)/(exp(b3) + exp(b5))(2), R-2 = 0.82, RMSE = 27.99 mu atm]. A comparison between the performances of a linear regression model and a machine learning model found that the XGBoost model had the highest fitting accuracy (R-2 = 0.94, RMSE = 16.86 mu atm). We used Landsat/OLI images acquired mainly in 2021 to map pCO(2) in Chagan Lake during the ice-free period. The pCO(2) in the surface water of Chagan Lake showed considerable spatiotemporal variability within a range of 0-200 mu atm. pCO(2) also showed significant seasonal variations, with the lowest and highest mean values in autumn (30-50 mu atm) and summer (120-150 mu atm), respectively. Spatially, the pCO(2) values in the southeast of Chagan Lake were higher than those in the northwest. The CO2 fluxes were calculated based on the pCO(2) and ranged from -3.69 to -2.42 mmol/m(2)/d, indicating that Chagan Lake was absorbing CO2 (i.e., it was a weak carbon sink). Temperature, chlorophyll a, total suspended matter, and turbidity were found to have reinforcing effects on the overall trend of pCO(2), while the Secchi disk depth was negatively correlated with pCO(2). The results of this study provide valuable insights for assessing the role of lakes in the carbon cycle in the context of climate change.

These isolates were identified based on their morphological characters, microscopic features, enzymatic profile and biochemical characteristics as Bacillus sphaericus APP21, Staphylococcus auricularis APP32, Microbacterium sp. APP41, and Kurthia sp. APP42 from Unkeshwar hot spring. Thermostable protease production was carried out using casein-yeast extract medium at 50 degrees C. Maximum specific activity of partially purified thermostable protease was recorded from Bacillus sphaericus APP21 (447.75 U/mg). Molecular weight of partially purified proteases from these isolates has been determined in the range of 14-29 KDa. These proteases have showed excellent thermostability in the range of temperature 45 to 65 degrees C. These proteases were catalytically active in the range of pH 7 to 9 and belonged to the class serine protease. Km and Vmax values were found in the range 5.26-8.34 mg/mL and 446-1380 U/mg respectively. The divalent cations Mg2+ and Mn2+ enhanced the catalytic efficiency of these proteases. These proteases showed excellent catalytic efficiency in presence of selected solvents, surfactants and detergents. These properties make them excellent candidates to use in detergent formulation, food processing, and in many biotechnologically important industries where proteolysis is needed at an elevated range of temperature.

The aim was to determine which factor(s) controlled viral dynamics using detailed concomitant published data on inorganic nutrients, chlorophyll a, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and bacterial production for Beaver Lake (Freshwater Biology, 51, 2006, 1119). Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of the bacterial community was also undertaken to investigate the potential relationship between bacterial community composition and viral dynamics. Virus concentration ranged between 1.43x104 and 302.4x104 virusesmL-1 and showed a clear increase over the summer, while bacterial concentrations exhibited no seasonal pattern (range: 9.6x104 to 44.6x104 cellsmL-1). Consequently, VBR varied with highest values in January (3.32-7.33). The percentage of lysogenic phage was low, ranging from 0 to 11.69%, suggesting that other life cycles (i.e. lytic or possibly pseudolysogeny) were taking place. Attempts to measure viral production using both the TdR incorporation technique and the dilution technique failed to produce consistent results, in common with other ultra-oligotrophic Antarctic lakes. There were significant correlations between viral concentration and each of chlorophyll a, DOC, ammonium and nitrate concentrations and bacterial production, but not between bacterial abundance and either soluble reactive phosphorus or temperature. Lack of change in the dominant bacterial community composition over summer suggests that changes in viral concentrations were a function of changes in other biological and physicochemical factors, rather than changes in host/phage infection. The results suggest a significant connection between viruses and bacteria, with the DOC pool acting as a conduit for the movement of carbon between the two components.

J	Tolli, JD; Taylor, CD				Tolli, JD; Taylor, CD			Biological CO oxidation in the Sargasso Sea and in Vineyard Sound, Massachusetts	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												In situ dissolved carbon monoxide (CO) in oligotrophic waters follows a diel cycle varying from 0.3 to 0.5 nmol L-1 before dawn to 2.5 to 3 nmol L-1 in early afternoon, when photo-production of CO exceeds biological CO oxidation and other sinks. Coastal waters may contain up to 15 nmol L-1 [CO] in the daytime. Assays to measure the rate of CO bio-oxidation typically involve the addition of labeled CO to sealed samples, resulting in CO concentrations that are above ambient levels during incubation (up to 9 nmol L-1 CO). We find that biological oxidation of CO obeys first-order kinetics when incubated with up to 4 nmol L-1 [CO] in coastal water samples and up to between 4 and 10.8 nmol L-1 in oligotrophic waters. At higher [CO], kinetic behavior transitions to zero-order or saturation kinetics. CO-oxidation rate coefficients obtained in dark incubations were not representative of the entire diurnal period, as others have assumed. Biological CO-oxidation rate coefficients k(co) measured in dark incubations of Sargasso Sea surface water in summer were 0.020 +/- 0.002 h(-1) (mean - standard deviation) and an order of magnitude greater than those measured in situ during daylight hours (0.002 +/- 0.001 h(-1)). Dark and in situ rate coefficients in early spring were 0.006 +/- 0.004 h(-1) and 0.003 0.001 h(-1), respectively. In dark incubations of Vineyard Sound water, k(co) was 0.127 +/- 0.038 h(-1). The apparent half-saturation constant K-app for CO ranged from 2.04 to 5.44 nmol L-1 CO in both environments.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2005	50	4					1205	1212		10.4319/lo.2005.50.4.1205	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2005.50.4.1205													WOS:000230585100017

However, the interdecadal varibility of winter extreme precipitation over the TP and its linkage with Arctic sea ice are still unclear. In this study, the characteristics and mechisnems of the TP extreme precipitation (TPEP) influenced by Arctic sea ice on interdecadal timescale are studied based on the daily precipitation, monthly sea ice concentration and ERA5 reanalysis data from 1980 to 2018. We found that the dominant mode of the TPEP in winter mostly exhibits a uniform spatial variation on the interdecadal timescale, with an opposite weak variation in the southeastern TP, and the Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) before 2002 are larger than that after 2003. The interdecadal variation of TPEP is affected by two teleconnection wave trains regulated by the Barents and Kara Sea ice. In the light ice years, a remarkable positive geopotential height (HGT) anomaly appears over the Barents-Kara Sea and a remarkable negative HGT anomaly is located over the Lake Baikal. Two wave trains originating over the Barents-Kara Sea can be observed. The southern branch forms a wave train through the North Atlantic along the subtropical westerly jet stream, showing a '+ - + - +' pattern of HGT anomalies from Arctic to the TP. Negative HGT anomaly controls the western TP, which creates dynamic and water vapor conditions for the TPEP. The northern branch forms a wave train through the Lake Baikal and the southeast of the TP, showing a '+ - +' HGT anomaly distribution. Positive HGT anomaly controls the southeastern TP, which is not conducive to precipitation in the region. When the SIC in the Barents-Kara Sea increases, the situation is opposite. The above analysis also reveals the reason for the difference in the east-west distribution of the TPEP.

Measurements were made at 0.5 m depth of temperature, total chlorophyll a, chlorophyll-containing picoplankton cell density, mean picoplankton cell volume and percentage of phycoerythrin-rich cells in the total picoplankton population. All lakes showed maxima for total chlorophyll concentration and picoplankton cell density in mid- to late summer. The maximum value for picoplankton density ranged from 3.4 x 10(3) (Esthwaite Water) to 1.3 x 10(6) cells ml-1 (Ennerdale Water). There was a significant negative relationship (p < 0.05) between log10 of maximum picoplankton cell density and maximum total chlorophyll, the latter being taken as an indicator of lake trophic status. The ratio of maximum to minimum picoplankton density during the year in a particular lake ranged from 39 to 2360 and showed no obvious relationship to lake type. Overall, the seasonal range in picoplankton density was about one order of magnitude greater than the range in total chlorophyll a, but there were considerable differences between lakes. Phycoerythrin-rich picoplankton as a percentage of total picoplankton reached a maximum in summer in all lakes. Values were always very low (< 5 %) in the two shallow eutrophic lakes, but reached 97 % and over in the four most oligotrophic lakes. In two of the oligotrophic lakes, Wast-water and Ennerdale Water, phycoerythrin-rich picoplankton was a major component of the summer phytoplankton biomass.																			0020-9309						1991	76	4					545	554		10.1002/iroh.19910760407	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19910760407													WOS:A1991HE11500006

The stability of autochthonous dissolved organic matter (Auto-DOM) produced by BCP in karst aquatic ecosystems may play a critical role in the missing carbon sink. However, the source of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in inland waters and its consumption by planktonic bacteria have not been thoroughly examined. Recalcitrant dissolved organic matter (RDOM) may exist in karst aquatic ecosystem as in the ocean. Through the study of the chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and the interaction between CDOM and the planktonic bacterial community under different land uses at the Shawan Karst Water-carbon Cycle Test Site, SW China, we found that C2, as the fluorescence component of Auto-DOM mineralised by planktonic bacteria, may have some of the characteristics of RDOM and is an important DOM source in karst aquatic ecosystems. The stability ratio (Fmax((C2/(C1+C2)))) of Auto-DOM reached 89.6 +/- 6.71% in winter and 64.1 +/- 7.19% in spring. Moreover, correlation-based network analysis determined that the planktonic bacterial communities were controlled by different fluorescence types of CDOM, of which C1 (fresh Auto-DOM), C3 (conventional allochthonous DOM (Allo-DOM)) and C4 (the Allo-DOM mineralised by bacteria) were clustered in one module together with prevalent organic-degrading planktonic bacteria; C2 was clustered in another tightly combined module, suggesting specific microbial utilization strategies for the C2 component. In addition, some important planktonic bacterium and functional genes (including chemotrophic heterotrophs and photosynthetic bacteria) were found to be affected by high Ca2+ and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations in karst aquatic ecosystems. Our research showed that Auto-DOM may be as an important carbon sink as the Allo-DOM in karst ecosystems, the former generally being neglected based on a posit that it is easily and first mineralized by planktonic bacteria.					; Li, Qiang/AAF-7841-2021; Hu, Yundi/KLZ-3806-2024; He, Haibo/ABF-3668-2020; Liu, Zaihua/K-2869-2013; Xia, Fan/GQP-4575-2022; Zeng, Cheng/A-9476-2013; ZHANG, YIFEI/GRO-0728-2022; Zhao, Min/JGM-3156-2023	He, Haibo/0000-0002-5398-8169; Liu, Zaihua/0000-0002-6211-7357; Qian, Bao/0000-0002-5230-7587; Chen, Bo/0009-0003-4067-3322; Li, Qiang/0000-0003-1265-8435; 													0043-1354	1879-2448				JUL 15	2022	220								118723	10.1016/j.watres.2022.118723	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.118723		JUN 2022						35696806					WOS:000815781200001

DCMs are ecologically important hot spots of primary production and nutrient cycling, and their location can determine vertical habitat gradients for primary consumers. Consequently, the drivers of DCM structure regulate many characteristics of aquatic food webs and biogeochemistry. Previous studies have identified light and thermal stratification as important drivers of summer DCM depth, but their relative importance across a broad range of lakes is not well resolved. We analyzed profiles of chlorophyll fluorescence, temperature, and light during summer stratification from 100 lakes in the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON) and quantified two characteristics of DCM structure: depth and thickness. While DCMs do form in oligotrophic lakes, we found that they can also form in eutrophic to dystrophic lakes. Using a random forest algorithm, we assessed the relative importance of variables associated with light attenuation vs. thermal stratification for predicting DCM structure in lakes that spanned broad gradients of morphometry and transparency. Our analyses revealed that light attenuation was a more important predictor of DCM depth than thermal stratification and that DCMs deepen with increasing lake clarity. DCM thickness was best predicted by lake size with larger lakes having thicker DCMs. Additionally, our analysis demonstrates that the relative importance of light and thermal stratification on DCM structure is not uniform across a diversity of lake types.

Detailed analyses of the dates of formation and termination of the ice cover, the duration of maximum thickness and ice-free period during winter were carried out. Various tendencies were found in the time series of the earliest freeze-up dates, whereas the latest ice break-up dates were recorded to occur much earlier than in the past on all the lakes, with time advance being on average from 0.6 to 0.8 day year(-1). The period with ice cover has been getting shorter at the rate of 0.8 to 0.9 day year(-1), with the exception of Lake Hancza, the deepest lake in the European Lowland, where the rate of 0.4 day year(-1) was recorded. Similarly, there was a decreasing tendency in the maximum thickness of the ice cover, at the rate of 0.26 to 0.60 cm year(-1). Despite similar tendencies, all those changes showed diverse dynamics in particular lakes. The proposed indicator of the ice cover stability confirms the above statements, and thus, the undergoing climatic changes.

J	Levy, DB; Custis, KH; Casey, WH; Rock, PA				Levy, DB; Custis, KH; Casey, WH; Rock, PA			The aqueous geochemistry of the abandoned Spenceville copper Pit, Nevada County, California	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												The Spenceville Pit in Nevada County, CA, has been filled with acidic mine drainage for approximately 75 yr and is an active source of acidity and trace metals to an adjacent stream. This study was conducted to characterize the aqueous chemistry of the Spenceville Pit to better understand pit lake geochemistry. Filtered samples were collected at regular depth intervals and analyzed for Ca, Mg, Na, K, Fe, Al, Mn, Cu, Zn, Pa, Si, Pb, and P. The geochemical speciation model MINTEQA2 was used to calculate the activity ratios of Fe2+ (aq) to Fe3+ (aq) based on measurement of oxidation-reduction potential using a combination Pt/Ag-AgCl electrode, and to calculate saturation indices for various mineral phases. Sampling of the Spenceville Pit in summer (August) and in winter (December) shows that the deeper waters exhibit considerably higher concentrations of metals compared with the shallow waters, and that the water column may be permanently stratified. Neither the scavenging of trace metals (Cu, Ni, and Zn) by particulate iron-hydroxide minerals nor their precipitation as metal sulfides exerts significant control on the distribution of metals in the pit water. Instead, elemental distributions appear to be controlled by the process of cyclic filling and evaporation. Analysis of mineral saturation states in the pit water and x-ray diffraction analysis of the bottom sediments indicate that gypsum (CaSO4 . 2H(2)O), goethite (alpha-FeOOH), jarosite [KFe3(SO4)(2)(OH)(6)], jurbanite (AlOHSO4 . 5H(2)O), and strengite (FePO4 . 2H(2)O) are solids that may potentially control elemental concentrations in the water column.																			0047-2425					JAN-FEB	1997	26	1					233	243		10.2134/jeq1997.00472425002600010033x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1997.00472425002600010033x													WOS:A1997WE44200043

The design of the study was to investigate the chemical composition of local precipitation in the Kilpisjarvi region and determine the factors influencing it. To this aim, we collected 29 snow samples from the Lake Saana catchment and its surroundings in spring of 2008 and 2009. Already within the radius of a few hundred metres, significant chemical heterogeneity could be detected in the snow cover, caused by mixed marine and terrestrial precipitation and the impact of local rock dust. Based on the Cl-/Ca2+ ratio in snow, this could occur in localised areas, where marine or terrestrial aerosols predominate. Clear correlation was noted between SO42- and Ca2+, induced possibly by recombination of SO42- with carbonaceous dust. Other factors, such as nitrification in snow cover, could also have affected the pH levels of snow, which are mostly controlled by carbonate dust. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A 4500-year proxy climate record from peatlands in the North of Ireland: the identification of widespread summer 'drought phases'?	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS					Annual Discussion Meeting of the Quaternary-Research-Association	JAN 08-10, 2008	ENGLAND	Quaternary Res Assoc				Mid-to-late Holocene high-resolution testate amoebae-derived water table reconstructions from two peatlands in the North of Ireland are presented The proxy climate records are dated and correlated using a combination of AMS C-14 dating, spheroidal carbonaceous particles and tephrochronology. The reconstructions start prior to the Hekla 4 tephra isochron (2395-2279 BC) and thus span the last similar to 4500 years The records are compiled by the process of tuning within chronological errors, standardisation and stacking. Comparisons are made to existing palaeoclimate records from peatlands in Northern Britain and Ireland and the compiled lake-level record for mid-latitude Europe. Four coherent dry phases are identified in the records at ca 1150-800 BC, 320 BC-AD 150, AD 250-470 and AD 1850-2000. Recent research has shown that peat-derived water table reconstructions reflect summer water deficit and therefore the dry phases are interpreted as periods with a higher frequency and/or greater magnitudes of summer drought. These 'drought phases' occur during periods of relatively low C-14 production, which may add support to the hypothesis of persistent solar forcing of climate change during the Holocene Any relationship with the North Atlantic stacked drift ice record is less clear.

No evidence of migration in a 4-year study of an at-risk migratory fish-the centenarian bigmouth buffalo (Ictiobus cyprinellus) of Saskatchewan	FACETS												The bigmouth buffalo (Ictiobus cyprinellus, Valenciennes 1844) is a long-lived freshwater fish native to North America that is listed as a species of special concern in its Saskatchewan-Nelson range. Little is known about their ecology and behavior, especially in the Saskatchewan Qu'Appelle River system where it faces multiple threats such as habitat fragmentation and competition with invasive species. In this study, we used acoustic telemetry to track the movements of 44 bigmouth buffalo throughout the Qu'Appelle River system in 2017-2019, and 2021, to monitor migration patterns from spring to fall and investigate if any of the five dams were impeding their ability to access either breeding or overwintering grounds. We found that bigmouth buffalo demonstrated minimal use of the river during this 4-year study, instead staying within the confines of a single lake year-round. Our results suggest that bigmouth buffalo in the Qu'Appelle River do not exhibit migratory behavior during nonflooding years. Considering their extended lifespan (>125 years), this could be attributed to their potential bethedging strategy for spawning primarily during flood years. The results indicate that bigmouth buffalo voluntarily remained within Buffalo Pound Lake throughout the study period. Whether this behavior was natural or was influenced by modifications to the system's hydrology requires further investigation.					; Ferrari, Maud/A-9585-2008	Achtymichuk, Gabrielle/0000-0002-7850-8408; 													2371-1671					JAN 20	2025	10								0036	10.1139/facets-2024-0036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/facets-2024-0036													WOS:001419195400001
J	Giordano, N; Raymond, J				Giordano, Nicolo; Raymond, Jasmin			Alternative and sustainable heat production for drinking water needs in a subarctic climate (Nunavik, Canada): Borehole thermal energy storage to reduce fossil fuel dependency in off-grid communities	APPLIED ENERGY												The development of renewable energy technologies in the Arctic faces technical barriers mainly related to extremely cold temperature. Moreover, storage issues to bridge the gap between supply and demand are more compelling than in temperate climates. Can underground thermal energy storage be efficiently used in such a cold environment to offer a viable seasonal storage alternative? This working hypothesis was tested by designing and simulating for the first time a borehole thermal energy storage facility in a subarctic climate. A system comprising a 1000 m(2) gross solar area and one hundred 30-m-deep borehole heat exchangers was simulated in TRNSYS to cover part of the heating demand of a pumping station that supplies drinking water in Kuujjuaq (Northern Quebec, Canada). The Nunavik capital is characterized by more than 8000 heating degree days below 18 degrees C and average spring-summer solar radiation of 4.6 kWh m(-2) d(-1). Despite the presence of discontinuous scattered permafrost in the area, the study site is free of frozen ground, likely due to a talik that developed around a nearby lake. A number of scenarios reveal that solar fraction of 45 to 50% and heat recovery of more than 60% can be achieved by the 3rd year of operation, resulting in annual savings of 7000 l of regular diesel consumption. A 50-years life-cycle cost analysis demonstrates that a specific incentive program can guarantee similar net present cost and levelized cost of energy compared to the current diesel-dependent situation, or better if electricity comes from renewable source. An additional 10% loss of thermal energy occurs when groundwater advection is a factor. FEFLOW simulations demonstrate that square-shaped storage together with a newly-proposed borehole connection design can reduce advection heat loss by 60% and improve the overall performance of the system. This work validates the technical viability of underground thermal energy storage in subarctic climates and indicates it could help reduce fossil fuel consumption in remote arctic regions across the world.

Odonata is a potential group of organisms that could indicate these habitat alterations once they have aquatic and terrestrial life forms. In this study, we tested the use of adult odonate individual species and community assemblage measures to evaluate the effect of riparian vegetation cut-off and sewage discharges. The study was performed at Turvo Sujo River, in Vicosa, Southern Brazil. We selected twelve sites, six of them were upstream and six were downstream the city. Species abundance and species richness estimates of adult odonates were performed on sunny days during summer and winter. We analyzed the goodness-of-fit of the species abundances to geometric and lognormal series. We also measured the Habitat Physical Integrity Score (HPIS), pasture and forest proportions and physicochemical water parameters at each site. Only few species were abundant in up- and downstream regions. Abundance of Argia modesta was higher at the upstream (t = 3.188; df = 17: p = 0.005) than at the downstream region and this species is a potential habitat bioindicator organisms. Species richness was statistically different only in the wet season and species-abundance relations at the two regions fitted well to both geometric and lognormal series. The lack of riparian vegetation indicates a loss of habitat integrity and heterogeneity at Turvo Sujo River basin, which was mainly dominated by lake-dwelling odonate species. Low species richness differences are caused by species pool biases toward those ones capable to survive at degraded ecosystems, suggesting that the effects of water parameters are much less important than a landscape dominated by pastures and practically without forests. We suggest the use of species-abundance models (like geometric and lognormal series) to determine the degree of impacts over a given community once they are simple models and can show intrinsic processes structuring communities.

Chronological control is provided by four accelerator mass spectrometry C-14 dates and five U-series dates on diatom silica. The core has been analyzed for magnetic susceptibility, loss-on-ignition, carbonate content, sediment chemistry and mineralogy, and pollen and diatom composition. The basin was occupied by a deep freshwater lake throughout the late Pleistocene which, based on shoreline evidence, was at least 19 m deeper than today. The lake shallowed after ca. 57,000 yr B.P High variability typified the period between 54,600 and 38,000 yr B.P, probably with periodic desiccation and deflation. A deep-water lake was reestablished after 38,000 yr B.P and persisted until ca. 29,000 yr B.P Shallowing occurred through the last glacial maximum, although the lake was still deeper than at present. The Pleistocene-Holocene transition was marked by a distinctive change in the diatom flora. There is no diatom record for much of the Holocene, but other proxies indicate generally dry, stable catchment conditions. The Babicora record is more akin to those from the southwest United States than it is to Central America and northern South America. Wet conditions in the late Pleistocene are attributed to winter rainfall from midlatitudes in contrast to the modern, tropical, summer rainfall regime. (C) 2002 university of Washington.

Temporal trends 1975-1998	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Concentrations of total mercury, selenium and a suite of organochlorine compounds were measured in eggs of thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia), northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) and black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) collected on Prince Leopold Island in Lancaster Sound, Nunavut, Canada, between 1975 and 1998. Mercury levels in thick-billed murre and northern fulmar eggs increased significantly during this period while selenium concentrations decreased significantly in northern fulmar eggs. Mercury and selenium concentrations in black-legged kittiwake eggs exhibited no significant temporal trends. Concentrations of Sigma PCB, Sigma DDT and total chlorobenzenes decreased over time for all three species and there was a shift in the PCB congener pattern as the hexachlorobiphenyl fraction of Sigma PCB increased and the lower chlorinated biphenyl fraction decreased. Total chlordane, dieldrin and mirex concentrations decreased in kittiwake eggs while no significant trends were observed for the other two species. Increases in Sigma HCH levels were detected in thick-billed murre eggs but not in northern fulmar and black-legged kittiwake eggs. Levels of the beta -HCH isomer, however, increased significantly in murres and fulmars. Stable-nitrogen isotope analyses (delta N-15) indicate that the temporal trends observed for contaminant concentrations in eggs were not the result of shifts in trophic level. Changing deposition patterns of xenobiotic compounds over the summer and winter ranges of these birds provide a likely explanation for differing exposures through time.

The world's largest High Arctic lake responds rapidly to climate warming	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Using a whole-watershed approach and a combination of historical, contemporary, modeled and paleolimnological datasets, we show that the High Arctic's largest lake by volume (Lake Hazen) has succumbed to climate warming with only a similar to 1 degrees C relative increase in summer air temperatures. This warming deepened the soil active layer and triggered large mass losses from the watershed's glaciers, resulting in a similar to 10 times increase in delivery of glacial melt-waters, sediment, organic carbon and legacy contaminants to Lake Hazen, a >70% decrease in lake water residence time, and near certainty of summer ice-free conditions. Concomitantly, the community assemblage of diatom primary producers in the lake shifted dramatically with declining ice cover, from shoreline benthic to open-water planktonic species, and the physiological condition of the only fish species in the lake, Arctic Char, declined significantly. Collectively, these changes place Lake Hazen in a biogeochemical, limnological and ecological regime unprecedented within the past similar to 300 years.

J	Xu, L; Wang, YZ; Zhou, LZ				Xu, Li; Wang, Yongzhi; Zhou, Lizhi			Threshold responses and relationships between waterbird distribution and habitat factors at Shengjin Lake, China	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION												The wintering period is an essential part of the annual life history of waterbirds. The environmental conditions of habitats in winter directly affect the abundance and physical condition of waterbirds. Therefore, it is important to study the relationship between waterbird abundance and habitat factors. In this study, we conducted significance and threshold analyses between habitat factors and the waterbird community at Shengjin Lake, a Ramsar Site in China, using Redundancy Analysis (RDA), Spearman Correlation Analysis, and Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN). The results indicate that seven environmental variables significantly affected the abundance of waterbird communities, that is, fractional vegetation cover, degree of receding water, grassland area, mudflat area, shallow water area, deep water area, and distance to reeds. Waterbird communities exhibited significant threshold responses to all seven factors. The number of species significantly responding to different habitat factors varied among waterbird communities, with the highest number of species (15) responding to distance to reeds. Except for the deep water area and distance to reeds, waterbirds showed higher positive than negative thresholds for the remaining five factors. Different groups of waterbirds influenced the threshold responses of waterbird communities to habitat factors, and there were variations in how each waterbird group responded to these factors. The results of this study highlight the importance of habitat type, water recession degree, and shelter conditions in waterbird habitat selection. Minor differences in habitat structure can influence waterbird habitat preferences. Therefore, wetland management at Shengjin Lake should consider the specific habitat needs of different waterbird species.

Fish, Including Their Carcasses, Are Net Nutrient Sources to the Water Column of a Eutrophic Lake	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Animals can act as sources or sinks of nutrients in ecosystems, and their role in this context may depend on the fate of nutrients in decomposing carcasses, which may contain recalcitrant structures such as bones. Our goal was to assess whether a fish population with high biomass is a source or sink of nutrients to the pelagic zone of a eutrophic lake over time scales ranging from days to 20 years. We developed a population-level model based on a 20-year (1996-2015) dataset for gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) in Acton Lake, a eutrophic reservoir in southwest Ohio, U.S.A. In addition, we used data from experiments that quantified nutrient mineralization rates from carcasses as functions of fish size and temperature. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) remineralization rates from carcasses increased with temperature and decreased with fish size. Over the 20 years, almost all (similar to 99%) of the nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) produced as gizzard shad carcasses was remineralized back to the water column. At the ecosystem scale, carcass nutrient dynamics followed a seasonal pattern, with a net accumulation of carcass nutrients in winter but a net depletion of the carcass nutrient pool in summer, due to mineralization. Dynamics of carcass production and remineralization were strongly influenced by young-of-year fish (YOY), for both N and P, because the number of fish born varied considerably across years, YOY have high mortality rates, and YOY carcasses decompose rapidly. On an annual basis, in a few years biomass production was higher than mineralization, suggesting that in these years fish biomass may act as a nutrient sink at the annual scale. However, nutrient excretion by the population greatly exceeded sequestration of nutrients in biomass (living and dead). Because most of the nutrients consumed (and excreted) by this population are derived from the benthos, at the lake-wide scale and considering all fluxes, the population is a significant net source of nutrients to the pelagic habitat. Our model demonstrates the relevance of considering spatial and temporal scale as well as long-term population dynamics when studying the role of animals as nutrient sources or sinks.					; Nobre, Regina/P-6637-2016; Jimenez Gonzalez, Maria/JXN-1084-2024; Carneiro, Luciana/A-8675-2008	Carneiro, Luciana/0000-0003-3242-5954; NOBRE, REGINA/0000-0001-9866-3467; 													2296-701X					SEP 10	2019	7								340	10.3389/fevo.2019.00340	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2019.00340													WOS:000485017300001

To mitigate these negative effects, artificial floating islands that mimic natural littoral zones appear as a promising mitigation tool. However, their effectiveness in supporting fish communities remains poorly documented. In this study, three artificial floating littoral zones (FLOLIZ, 70 m2 surface area) were installed in a French hydropower reservoir subject to extreme WLF. Fish communities were assessed in spring and summer over four years in FLOLIZ and in control littoral stations during daytime and nighttime. Fish, especially juveniles, did not appear more frequently in FLOLIZ than in control littoral stations during daytime. At night, both adult and juvenile fish were more abundant in the littoral zone of the reservoir. During the day, the fish community in FLOLIZ was mainly composed of juvenile Chondrostoma toxostoma and adult Perca fluviatilis. Differences occurred only for a few species and life stages (juvenile vs adult); however, in general, results indicated greater abundance or richness in control littoral stations. These results do not support the effectiveness of FLOLIZ in mitigating deleterious effects of artificial WFL. The distance of FLOLIZ to the littoral zone could explain these results. Further studies in different environmental conditions, in different ecosystems and with different FLOLIZ designs are needed to provide additional information on the effectiveness of such structures as a mitigation tool.					westrelin, samuel/JEO-8076-2023	SALMON, Quentin/0000-0003-0151-0208													1961-9502					JAN 15	2025		426							3	10.1051/kmae/2024025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/kmae/2024025													WOS:001395959300001
J	Crawshaw, JA; Schallenberg, M; Savage, C; Van Hale, R				Crawshaw, Josie A.; Schallenberg, Marc; Savage, Candida; Van Hale, Robert			Hierarchy of factors controls denitrification rates in temperate intermittently closed and open coastal lakes/lagoons (ICOLLS)	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Intermittently closed and open lakes/lagoons (ICOLLs) can occur in alternate stable states: clear and turbid, with nitrogen inputs from high-intensity agricultural land use often fuelling phytoplankton growth in ICOLLs. Due to their limited water exchange, ICOLLs are particularly susceptible to eutrophication. In these environments, denitrification may remove a substantial proportion of the land-derived nitrogen load, reducing their vulnerability to eutrophication; however, the factors that influence denitrification in ICOLLs are poorly understood. In this study, we addressed the relative importance of physico-chemical and biotic factors related to nitrate-saturated denitrification rates (including temperature, nutrient/organic matter supply, oxygen conditions, sediment type and benthic macroinvertebrates) in two eutrophic ICOLL ecosystems: one supports some submerged macrophytes, while the other is in a persistent, turbid, phytoplankton-dominated system. Flexible in situ enclosures and denitrification enzyme assay measurements were employed to determine denitrification rates in response to new nitrate pulses, which are commonly observed in these systems. In situ denitrification rates were inhibited in both ICOLLs in winter, whereas in summer they were positively correlated with organic matter availability. Denitrification rates were greater in the shallow, marginal sediments of the ICOLLs. Bioturbating macrofauna significantly enhanced in situ sediment oxygenation and probably transported sediment organic carbon and nitrate simultaneously to sites of denitrification at the sediment oxic-anoxic interface. Our study found that nitrate-saturated sediment denitrification rates were controlled by a hierarchy of temporally and spatially structured physico-chemical and biotic factors in the following order of importance: temperature -> organic matter availability -> water depth -> bioturbation.

Seasonality buffers carbon budget variability across heterogeneous landscapes in Alaskan Arctic tundra	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Arctic tundra exhibits large landscape heterogeneity in microtopography, hydrology, and active layer depth. While many carbon flux measurements and experiments are done at or below the mesoscale (1 km), modern ecosystem carbon modeling is often done at scales of 0.25 degrees-1.0 degrees latitude, creating a mismatch between processes, process input data, and verification data. Here we arrange the naturally complex terrain into mesoscale landscape types of varying microtopography and moisture status to evaluate how landscape types differ in terms of CO2 and CH4 balances and their combined warming potential, expressed as CO2 equivalents (CO2-eq). Using a continuous 4 year dataset of CO2 and CH4 fluxes obtained from three eddy covariance (EC) towers, we investigate the integrated dynamics of landscape type, vegetation community, moisture regime, and season on net CO2 and CH4 fluxes. EC towers were situated across a moisture gradient including a moist upland tundra, a heterogeneous polygon tundra, and an inundated drained lake basin. We show that seasonal shifts in carbon emissions buffer annual carbon budget differences caused by site variability. Of note, high growing season gross primary productivity leads to higher fall zero-curtain CO2 emissions, reducing both variability in annual budgets and carbon sink strength of more productive sites. Alternatively, fall zero-curtain CH4 emissions are equal across landscape types, indicating site variation has little effect on CH4 emissions during the fall despite large differences during the growing season. We find that the polygon site has the largest mean warming potential (107 +/- 8.63 g C-CO2-eq m(-2) yr(-1)) followed by the drained lake basin site (82.12 +/- 9.85 g C-CO2-eq m(-2) yr(-1)) and the upland site (77.19 +/- 21.8 g C-CO2-eq m(-2) yr(-1)), albeit differences were not significant. The highest temperature sensitivities are also at the polygon site with mixed results between CO2 and CH4 at the other sites. Results show a similar mean annual net warming effect across dominant landscape types but that these landscape types vary significantly in the amounts and timing of CO2 and CH4 fluxes.					; Arndt, Kyle/ABC-2565-2021; Oechel, Walter/F-9361-2010; Oechel, Walter/M-1347-2019; Zona, Donatella/G-4039-2010	Arndt, Kyle/0000-0003-4158-2054; Oechel, Walter/0000-0002-3504-026X; Hashemi, Josh/0000-0002-8660-7406; Kalhori, Aram/0000-0002-0652-8987; Zona, Donatella/0000-0002-0003-4839													1748-9326					MAR	2021	16	3							035008	10.1088/1748-9326/abe2d1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/abe2d1													WOS:000620508300001
J	van der Knaap, WO; van Leeuwen, JFN				van der Knaap, WO; van Leeuwen, JFN			Climate-pollen relationships AD 1901-1996 in two small mires near the forest limit in the northern and central Swiss Alps	HOLOCENE												Climatic relationships were established in two Pb-210 dated pollen sequences from small mires closely surrounded by forest just below actual forest limits ( but about 300 m below potential climatic forest limits) in the northern Swiss Alps ( suboceanic in climate; mainly with Picea) and the central Swiss Alps ( subcontinental; mainly Pinus cembra and Larix) at annual or near-annual resolution from ad 1901 to 1996. Effects of vegetational succession were removed by splitting the time series into early and late periods and by linear detrending. Both pollen concentrations detrended by the depth-age model and modified percentages ( in which counts of dominant pollen types are down-weighted) are correlated by simple linear regression with smoothed climatic parameters with one- and two-year timelags, including average monthly and April/September daylight air temperatures and with seasonal and annual precipitation sums. Results from detrended pollen concentrations suggest that peat accumulation is favoured in the northern-Alpine mire either by early snowmelt or by summer precipitation, but in the central-Alpine mire by increased precipitation and cooler summers, suggesting a position of the northern-Alpine mire near the upper altitudinal limit of peat formation, but of the central-Alpine mire near the lower limit. Results from modi Zed pollen percentages indicate that pollen production by plants growing near their upper altitudinal limit is limited by insufficient warmth in summer, and pollen production by plants growing near their lower altitudinal limit is limited by too-high temperatures. Only weakly significant pollen/climate relationships were found for Pinus cembra and Larix, probably because they experience little climatic stress growing 300 m below the potential climatic forest limit.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				NOV	2003	13	6					809	828		10.1191/0959683603hl657rp	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683603hl657rp													WOS:000185916300002

The measurements concerned mostly the maximum height, length and width of ice scars on trees, and the distance of these trees from the shore in the period 2017-2022. It was observed that sheets of ice advanced up to 64 m inland, and piled to form hummocks reaching up to 4.3 m above the water level. These maximum values occurred mostly on eastern shores, which is where the highest numbers of damaged and broken trees were observed. This should be associated with the strongest and most frequently occurring wind blowing from the western direction in the winter-spring period. To the contrary, the lowest number of damaged trees were observed on the western shore. This is due not only to the lower frequency of wind blowing from the east, and the associated cooling (Ta < 0degree celsius) and ice cover stabilization, but also due to the presence of extensive reed belts. Our results enable an indirect insight into the ice phenomena dynamics, especially in areas lacking systematic ice observations. Similar conclusions may be extended for all the sheltered basins as lakes or lagoons.					; Łabuz, Tomasz/N-5305-2019	Labuz, Tomasz/0000-0002-6138-2052; Swiatek, Malgorzata/0000-0001-5163-559X													0137-477X	2081-6383				MAR 1	2024	43	1					93	110		10.14746/quageo-2024-0006	http://dx.doi.org/10.14746/quageo-2024-0006		JAN 2024											WOS:001157442900001

These varying movements of the pipeline, depending on the underground, the surface cover and the pipeline itself, may lead to cracks and severe damage. These problems require a permanent monitoring of existing and a careful planning of new pipeline tracks. Currently the pipelines are regularly monitored by visual inspection via helicopter. Planning information such as a DEM and a classification of the surface cover is derived mainly from optical remote sensing and field work. The potential of radar data as a possibly more reliable and cost effective source of information for the monitoring and planning of gas pipelines in the remote and hardly accessible regions of Nadym, Siberia, was investigated. Methods used included the interpretation of multitemporal SAR backscattering as well as SAR interferometric products using ERS-1/ERS-2 Tandem data. ERS SAR data proved to be a valuable alternative for the mapping of the pipelines. The study is being carried out as an ESA Pilot Project (A02.D129) and funded by the German Space Agency (DARA).																			0379-6566		92-9092-656-2				1997	414						441	447																WOS:000073315300075
J	Yu, LP; Lai, ZP				Yu, LuPeng; Lai, ZhongPing			Holocene climate change inferred from stratigraphy and OSL chronology of aeolian sediments in the Qaidam Basin, northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Paleoclimatic reconstruction based on aeolian sediments in the eastern Qaidam Basin (QB) has been hindered by the limited chronological data. Here we present 61 Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) ages. On the basis of these OSL ages and the lithologic stratigraphy, we propose the 'effective moisture index (EMI)' for aeolian sediments to reconstruct the effective moisture change. Based on the EMI from twelve sections, the effective moisture change, moisture sources and relevant mechanisms for paleoclimatic change in the eastern QB are discussed. The results indicate that (1) aeolian deposition started at least before 12.4 +/- 0.7 ka during the deglaciation, the paleosols developed at the early and mid-Holocene, and aeolian sand and loess accumulated at mid- and late Holocene; (2) effective moisture history was: hyper-arid at 12.8-11.6 ka, humid and variable at 11.6-8.3 ka, moderately humid and stable at 83-3.5 ka, and increasingly arid at 3.5-0 ka; (3) the effective moisture change was mainly controlled by the Asian summer monsoon (ASM), which mainly followed the change of Northern Hemispheric summer insolation, and the westerlies strengthened and increased the aridity in the QB when the ASM shrank.

A high-resolution n-alkane record covering the past similar to 25 kyr was retrieved from Lake Tuofengling, a hydrologically closed crater lake in the central Great Khingan Mountains. The sediments contained a suite of mid-and long chain n-alkanes with a strong odd-to even-carbon number predominance. The relative proportion of mid-to long-chain n-alkane homologues (Paq) was proposed to evaluate the input of submerged/floating plants into lake sediments relative to that from emergent/terrestrial plants, which could be a useful indicator of lake level in lacustrine settings. The Paq proxy demonstrated that lake level increased stably from the shallowest level during the LGM to a maximum depth at 7.5-3.0 cal ka BP, with a minor decreasing trend during the late Holocene. The asynchronous changes in effective moisture in the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) region since the LGM might be directly or indirectly mediated by the shift in the rainfall belt, the position and intensity of the Western Pacific Subtropical High and Okhotsk High at different timescales. Our study provides new insights into climatic evolution in Northeast China, where the main climate pattern may not always be similar to the typical EASM pattern. (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

The carbon, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) forms or fractions in surface, interstitial water and sediments as well as extracellular enzymatic activities, P sorption, specific microbial abundance and community composition in sediments were analyzed. P regeneration pathway was dominated by iron-bound P desorption and phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria solubilization in severe-bloom and slight-bloom area respectively, which both resulted in high soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) accumulation in interstitial water. However, in severe-bloom area, higher P release potential caused the strong P release and algal growth, compared to slight-bloom area. In spring, P limitation and N selective assimilation of Dolichospermum facilitated nitrate accumulation in surface water, which provided enough N source for the initiation of Microcystis bloom. In summer, the accumulated organic N in Dolichospermum cells during its bloom was re-mineralized as ammonium to replenish N source for the sustainable development of Microcystis bloom. Furthermore, SRP continuous release led to the replacement of Dolichospermum by Microcystis with the advantage of P quick utilization, transport and storage. Taken together, the succession from Dolichospermum to Microcystis was due to both the different forms of N and P in water column mediated by different regeneration and transformation pathways as well as release potential, and algal N and P utilization strategies.

Spatiotemporal Changes in the Phytoplankton in Lake Baikal during Late Summer: II. Biomass	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												The results of a study of phytoplankton biomass in different regions of Lake Baikal according to data from 15 expeditions from 1994 to 2013 are presented in this paper. The spatial distribution and interannual dynamics of biomass of phytoplankton in all three basins of the lake are analyzed. The general biomass of phytoplankton during late summer is not high. The multiyear mean phytoplankton biomass equals 169 +/- 5 mg/m3 for the open waters of the lake. It is distributed relatively uniformly around southern Baikal. There are higher multiyear mean values along the eastern shore in the Middle and Northern Baikal. The late summer phytoplankton biomass in southern and middle basins does not differ. The mean multiyear biomass of phytoplankton of the northern basin is accurately lower than the one for the two others. No increase in biomass for any region of the lake is demonstrated. The relations of the general biomass of phytoplankton with water temperatures are very slight.

The analysis is supported by: (1) frequent (42 d) field measurements of the beam attenuation coefficient at 660 nm (c(660)) and "optical" backscattering (OBS) collected with rapid profiling instrumentation at multiple sites; (2) laboratory measurements of c(660) and turbidity (Tn); and (3) characterizations of inorganic particles with scanning electron microscopy interfaced with automated image and X-ray analyses. Conspicuous increases in light scattering levels are reported following runoff events, as reflected in increases in c(660), OBS and Tn, associated with terrigenous inputs of clay minerals. The extent of this impact is demonstrated to be driven by the magnitude of the runoff event. Terrigenous inputs of turbidity are shown to enter as density currents, which travel the entire length of the reservoir for major runoff events, manifested as peak scattering levels in subsurface layers. Strong longitudinal and lateral differences are documented soon after runoff peaks. Scattering levels and spatial gradients are shown to diminish rapidly, with pre-event conditions approached within a week. Systematically lower c(660) values are reported for laboratory measurements compared to in situ observations, particularly at high scattering levels, consistent with the operation of particle coagulation. In situ measurement of c(660) is identified as the preferred surrogate metric of light scattering.

We analyzed the surface-water hydrodynamics of a stream-take ecosystem for 3 years in the Sawtooth Mountains, Idaho, USA to understand how this coupled aquatic ecosystem behaved hydrologically. This analysis included quantifying streamflow regimes above and below the take, the expansion and contraction of the Lake, stream, and floodplain, and downstream responses to snowmelt and rainstorm events. Our results showed that flow regime metrics from both hydrology and ecology were similar between above and betow-lake reaches, but analysis that considered channel capacity and overbank flooding showed 2x more frequent and > 5x longer duration floods below the take compared to upstream reaches. The take surface area expanded by as much as 19% during snowmelt runoff because of a 0.5 m rise in the take level, and the Littoral zone expanded by an even greater proportion. The take had little influence on peakflows during spring snowmelt, though the inlet stream in the delta had a reduced flood magnitude compared to upstream stations. However, during large summer rainstorms when potential storage capacity was maximized, the take strongly attenuated peakflows downstream from the take. Water level changes at seven other stream-take ecosystems in the region showed a similar range of variation. Our results provide a case study of how coupled aquatic ecosystems behave hydrodynamically and underscore the need to consider the hydrologic connections and interactions that drive aquatic ecosystems.

The changed interactions of weather with catchments and hydrological processes caused unexpected changes in physical, chemical, and biological processes in lakes and streams. Permanent first-order streams became ephemeral. Flows at spring melt were lower, and chemical exports from catchments were reduced. Although catchments burned by forest fire had slightly higher flows and chemical exports than unburned basins in the years following fires, chemical exports generally declined due to lower streamflow. Decreased exports of silica indicated lower rates of weathering. Base cation exports also decreased, as did the ratio of base cations to strong acid anions in streams. Changes in lakes included warmer temperatures, clearer waters, deeper thermoclines and euphotic zones, higher alkalinities, and higher concentrations of base cations and nitrogen, but lower concentrations of dissolved organic C, silica, and P. The increase in alkalinity, was caused by increases in the ratio of base cations to strong acid anions, resulting from the interaction of increased water retention, microbial sulfate reduction, and exchanges of cations between water and sediments. Declines in chlorophyll and increases in phytoplankton biomass were observed, but there was no detectable effect on areal phytoplankton production. Summer subthermocline habitats for cold stenotherms were reduced slightly in extent as the results of thermocline deepening and lower hypolimnetic oxygen. There is considerable potential for interaction between climatic change and other human perturbations affecting boreal lakes, including acidification, increased incident UV radiation, eutrophication, and overharvesting.

Effects of climate and winter cover crops on nutrient loss in agricultural watersheds in the midwestern US	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Nutrient runoff from agricultural regions of the midwestern U.S. corn belt has degraded water quality in many inland and coastal water bodies such as the Great Lakes and Gulf of Mexico. Under current climate, observational studies have shown that winter cover crops can reduce dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus losses from row-cropped agricultural watersheds, but performance of cover crops in response to climate variability and climate change has not been systematically evaluated. Using the Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, calibrated using multiple years of field-based data, we simulated historical and projected future nutrient loss from two representative agricultural watersheds in northern Indiana, USA. For 100% cover crop coverage, historical simulations showed a 31-33% reduction in nitrate (NO3-) loss and a 15-23% reduction in Soluble Reactive Phosphorus (SRP) loss in comparison with a no-cover-crop baseline. Under climate change scenarios, without cover crops, projected warmer and wetter conditions strongly increased nutrient loss, especially in the fallow period from Oct to Apr when changes in infiltration and runoff are largest. In the absence of cover crops, annual nutrient losses for the RCP8.5 2080s scenario were 26-38% higher for NO3-, and 9-46% higher for SRP. However, the effectiveness of cover crops also increased under climate change. For an ensemble of 60 climate change scenarios based on CMIP5 RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, 19 out of 24 ensemble-mean simulations of future nutrient loss with 100% cover crops were less than or equal to historical simulations with 100% cover crops, despite systematic increases in nutrient loss due to climate alone. These results demonstrate that planting winter cover crops over row-cropped land areas constitutes a robust climate change adaptation strategy for reducing nutrient losses from agricultural lands, enhancing resilience to a projected warmer and wetter winter climate in the midwestern U.S.					Ehsani, Nima/F-9693-2017; Trentman, Matt/J-5757-2019														0165-0009	1573-1480				JAN	2024	177	1							9	10.1007/s10584-023-03656-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-023-03656-4													WOS:001132232900001

Coastal lake ice includes a belt of mobile brash and slush ice and a stable nearshore-ice complex (NIC). The NIC consists of an icefoot and a sequence of ice ridges founded on offshore bars with intervening ice lagoons. This complex can be developed and partly, or completely, destroyed several times during a single winter. Multiple winter coastal profiles illustrate both erosion and deposition consistent with displacement of wave energy from the shoreface to the ice-ridge face. Sediment concentrations indicate that the NIC and the belt of brash and slush contains 180 to 280 t (113 to 175 m3) of sand per kilometer of coast. This static sediment load is roughly equivalent to the average amount of sand eroded from the bluffs and to the amount accumulating in the deep lake basin each year. Sediment is being rafted alongshore in the mobile brash and slush at rates of 10 to 30 cm/sec. Applying conservative estimates of sediment loads to the drifting ice suggests that 0.35 to 2.75 x 10(3) t/day could be transported alongshore and around obstacles such as groins. The processes associated with the development, maintenance and destruction of the NIC do not protect the coast. Rather, shoreface erosion is enhanced as severe winter wave energy is displaced from the beach to the shoreface and coastal ice entrains and transports sediment alongshore and offshore.																			0749-0208					WIN	1993	9	1					65	86																WOS:A1993KW24200006

Gregory			Managing the Invasive Cyanobacterium Lyngbya wollei in a Southeastern USA Reservoir: Evaluation of a Multi-year Treatment Program	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Lyngbya wollei is a filamentous cyanobacterium that causes numerous adverse impacts in reservoirs and lakes, such as toxin production, harboring fecal bacteria, devaluing property, impeding navigation/recreation, and degrading wildlife habitat. This study assessed a chemical treatment program in a Southeastern USA reservoir using a chelated copper formulation (Captain (R) XTR) in combination with diquat dibromide (Tribune (R)) over 2 years. The treatment program consisted of multiple applications during the summer and fall months. Overall, biomass decreased significantly (alpha = 0.05) in the two treated coves, by 97 and 80%, whereas L. wollei increased significantly (alpha = 0.05) in the untreated reference cove, by 25,127%. During the study, the quantity of algaecide applied was decreased in one of the treatment coves to adjust for the reduction in L. wollei biomass, as well as reduction in treated area, as part of an adaptive management strategy. The measured exposure demonstrated the residence time of the copper algaecide was short, with most of the copper dissipating in hours, which was attributed to sorption to L. wollei, sediments, and dilution. The biomass monitoring procedure, used transects spaced in 150 m intervals and sampled algae at 0-2 m, 5-7 m, and 10-14 m distances from shore, was effective at discerning changes in L. wollei biomass in the treated and untreated coves. This study indicated that the treatment program was effective for reducing L. wollei biomass and demonstrated the utility of the surveying technique to implement adaptive management of this filamentous cyanobacterium.

The Nile is considered as a very important artery that joins Sudan and Egypt and was an important part of ancient Egyptian spiritual life. Nubian peoples are an ethnic group and considered as one of the most ancient peoples in the world, their civilization started more than 8,000 years ago. Lake Nasser is the second largest man-made lake in the world; among the impacts that were anticipated were the resettlement of the Nubian population in the area inundated by the reservoir, saving of historic monuments, health impacts and coastal erosion. The climate models all estimate a steady increase in temperatures for Egypt, with little intermeddle variance. Somewhat more warming is estimated for summer than for winter. However, since Egypt is mainly a desert and relies primarily on irrigated agriculture, precipitation over the country itself matters very little. Much more important are precipitation changes at the water sources of the Nile, which affect the vulnerability of the water resources. The potential impacts of climate change on coastal resources are ranked as most serious and climate change induced sea level rise reinforces this trend. In addition to this high biophysical exposure to the risk of sea level rise, Egypt's social sensitivity to sea level rise is particularly high. In general, although the models on average show an increase in precipitation, inter-model variation is so high that it is uncertain as to predict whether annual average precipitation will increase or decrease.																			2367-4024	2367-4032	978-3-319-45035-3; 978-3-319-45034-6				2017	15						61	72		10.1007/978-3-319-45035-3_5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-45035-3_5	10.1007/978-3-319-45035-3												WOS:000419723800006

Formation of sea ice ponds from ice-shelf runoff, adjacent to the McMurdo Ice Shelf, Antarctica	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY												Ponds that form on sea ice can cause it to thin or break-up, which can promote calving from an adjacent ice shelf. Studies of sea ice ponds have predominantly focused on Arctic ponds formed by in situ melting/ponding. Our study documents another mechanism for the formation of sea ice ponds. Using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images from the 2015-16 to 2018-19 austral summers, we analyze the evolution of sea ice ponds that form adjacent to the McMurdo Ice Shelf, Antarctica. We find that each summer, meltwater flows from the ice shelf onto the sea ice and forms large (up to 9 km(2)) ponds. These ponds decrease the sea ice's albedo, thinning it. We suggest the added mass of runoff causes the ice to flex, potentially promoting sea-ice instability by the ice-shelf front. As surface melting on ice shelves increases, we suggest that ice-shelf surface hydrology will have a greater effect on sea-ice stability.

An improved proximal tephrochronology for Redoubt Volcano, Alaska	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Sediment cores from lakes in volcanically active regions can be used to reconstruct the frequency of tephra-fall events. We studied sediment cores from two lakes within 25 km of the summit of Redoubt Volcano, western Cook Inlet, to develop a robust age model for the Holocene tephrochronology, and to assess the extent to which the tephrostratigraphies were correlative between the two nearby lakes. Visually distinct tephra layers were correlated among cores from Bear and Cub lakes, located within 17 km of each other, to construct a composite age model, which incorporates two Pu-activity profiles and 27 radiocarbon ages, and extends the record back to 11,540 cal a BP. The age model was used to interpolate the ages and quantify the uncertainties of ages for all tephras at least 1 mm thick. Between 55 and 3850 a BP, 31 tephras were deposited in Bear Lake and 41 tephras in Cub Lake. Bear Lake contains an additional 38 tephras deposited between 11,540 and 3850 a BP. During the period of overlap, (-55 to 3850 a BP), 24 tephras are of significantly different ages, including nine from Bear Lake and 17 from Cub Lake. The presence of these unique tephras indicates that ejecta plumes erupted from Redoubt Volcano can be highly directional, and that sediment cores from more than one lake are needed for a comprehensive reconstruction of tephra-fall events. Unlike distal lakes in south Alaska, where geomorphic and limnological factors dominate the quality of the tephrostratigraphic record, the variability in tephra-fall trajectory near a Redoubt Volcano appears to be a major control on the number of tephras contained in the sediment of proximal lakes.

Sulfide content reached 12 mg/liter at 74-degrees-C at the outflow. Growth of the cyanobacterial mat was observed at temperatures not exceeding 54-degrees-C. The main factor preventing the growth of oxygenous phototrophs was the high sulfide content, whilst the absence of Chloroflexus above 54-degrees-C was related to the concurrent presence of sulfide and dissolved oxygen. With decreasing temperature and sulfide concentration, the population of phototrophic organisms increased in range, and included some purple non-sulfur bacteria. A special association in which the purple sulfur bacteria, Thiocapsa roseopersicina and Chromatium vinosum predominated, was formed in the mats near the outflows of the under-water hydrotherms on the bottom of the Bol'shaya River. Aerobic bacteria, containing chlorophyll a, Erythrobacter sibiricus sp. nov. and other Erythrobacter sp., were detected in the microbial mats.																			0026-2617					NOV-DEC	1991	60	6					763	771																WOS:A1991JB10000020

These habitats include iron-bicarbonate springs, iron-arsenic-bicarbonate springs, and alpine lakes. Rates of microbial iron oxidation were measured up to a pH of 7.4, with only abiotic processes detected at higher pH values. Iron oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) were responsible for 39-89% of the net oxidation rate at locations where biological iron oxidation was detected. Members of putative iron oxidizing genera, especially Gallionella, are abundant in systems where biological iron oxidation was measured. Geochemical sampling suites accompanying each experiment include field data (temperature, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and redox sensitive solutes), solute concentrations, and sediment composition. Dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations indicate that bicarbonate and carbonate are typically the most abundant anions in these systems. Speciation calculations reveal that ferrous iron typically exists as FeCO3(aq), FeHCO3+, FeSO4(aq), or Fe2+ in these systems. The abundance of ferrous carbonate and bicarbonate species appears to lead to a dramatic increase in the abiotic rate of reaction compared to the rate expected from chemical oxidation in dilute solution. This approach, integrating geochemistry, rates, and community composition, reveals locations and geochemical conditions that permit microbial iron oxidation and locations where the abiotic rate is too fast for the biotic process to compete.

F16003	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Hidden Creek Lake (HCL), an ice-marginal lake impounded by Kennicott Glacier, Wrangell Mountains, Alaska, fills annually to 20 to 30 106 m3 and then drains subglacially within 2 to 3 days. During the 1999 and 2000 jokulhlaups, we carried out a series of planned observations around the lake and in the Kennicott River, which drains the glacier. Approximately 20% of the lake volume was contained within a subglacial water "wedge'' beneath the ice dam. The entire volume of the lake drains through the wedge; hydraulic head loss through this constriction may be responsible for the fairly symmetrical shape of the HCL outflow hydrographs, deduced from lake level records, basin hypsometry, and collapse of the ice dam. The flood hydrographs in the Kennicott River are similar in shape to the outflow hydrographs, and within error, lake volume matched the river flood volume in both years. Up to 12 x 106 m3 of water was temporarily stored within the glacier during the 2000 jokulhlaup. During the 2000 jokulhlaup the background flow in the Kennicott River shifted to a dilute chemical composition. As the HCL jokulhlaup progressed, Donoho Falls Lake filled with water whose chemistry was closer to that of the background flow in Kennicott River than to HCL water. Comparison of these chemical signals with typical summer variations in Kennicott River chemistry suggests that the jokulhlaup created high subglacial water pressure that impeded normal drainage of solute-rich water from a distributed drainage system into a conduit system at the glacier bed and even caused flow direction locally to reverse.					; ANDERSON, SUZANNE/F-4039-2014; Anderson, Suzanne/F-4039-2014; Walder, Joseph/J-8939-2017	Anderson, Robert/0000-0003-2759-4833; ANDERSON, SUZANNE/0000-0002-6796-6649; Walder, Joseph/0000-0003-3523-2998													2169-9003	2169-9011				OCT 10	2003	108	F1							F16003	10.1029/2002JF000004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2002JF000004													WOS:000224563800002
J	Malakauskas, DM; Wilzbach, MA				Malakauskas, David M.; Wilzbach, Margaret A.			Invertebrate assemblages in the lower Klamath River, with reference to Manayunkia speciosa	CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME												The freshwater polychaete, Manayunkia speciosa Leidy (Canalipalpata: Sabellidae), is the intermediate host for two myxozoan pathogens (Ceratomyxa shasta and Parvicapsula minibicornis) that cause substantial mortalities of juvenile salmon in the Pacific Northwest, particularly in the Klamath River below Iron Gate Dam in California. Information on the distribution of M. speciosa in the Klamath River may facilitate targeted control of polychaete populations to disrupt the parasites that affect fish populations. We sampled invertebrate assemblages in the lower Klamath River in the summer and fall of 2005 and 2006 to estimate distribution patterns of M. speciosa and to characterize assemblage structure of invertebrates in reaches where the polychaete was both collected and not collected. The polychaete was most often found in a reach of river extending 100 km downstream from the Shasta River (river km 185-287). The reach in which it was found supported high taxonomic richness of invertebrates and a high abundance of filtering collectors including marine relicts such as sponges, unionid mussels, and bryozoans. We suggest that the large, stable substrate on which these were found represents primary, optimal habitat for the polychaete, also a marine relict. Reaches above and below the zone where we collected polychaetes showed a general trend of reduced taxonomic richness as distance away from the polychaete zone increased, and also showed differing relative abundances of non-insect taxa and functional feeding groups. Differences in invertebrate assemblages between years were coincident with large differences in water flows. We suggest flows and food resources may play important roles in invertebrate distribution patterns.

Dating of the sediment showed that the samples covered the period 1820 to 2000. The sediment core record can be divided into two periods, an unperturbed period from 1820 to 1950 and a second period affected by human activities (from 1950 to 2000). This has been observed elsewhere in the Baltic Sea. The shift in the sediment core record after 1950 is likely caused by large scale damming of rivers. Diatom production was inferred from the Si isotope composition which ranged between delta(30) Si -0.18% and + 0.58 parts per thousand in BSi, and assuming fractionation patterns due to the Raleigh distillation, the production was shown to be correlated with air and water temperature, which in turn were correlated with the mixed layer(ML) depth. The sedimentary record showed that the deeper ML depth observed in colder years resulted in less production of diatoms. Pelagic investigations in the 1990's have clearly shown that diatom production in the Baltic Sea is controlled by the ML depth. Especially after cold winters and deep water mixing, diatom production was limited and dissolved silicate (DSi) concentrations were not depleted in the water column after the spring bloom. Our method corroborates these findings and offers a new method to estimate diatom production over much longer periods of time in diatom dominated aquatic systems, i.e. a large part of the world's ocean and coastal seas.

J	Nakayama, T				Nakayama, Tadanobu			Simulation of complicated and diverse water system accompanied by human intervention in the North China Plain	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The author simulated water/heat dynamics in the North China plain (NCP) by coupling the NIES Integrated Catchment-based Eco-hydrology (NICE) model series with dam/canal systems in the agricultural and urban areas (NICE-CNL). This combined model was applied to the Hai River catchment and the lower reach of the Yellow River (530 km wide x 840 km long) at a resolution of 5 km. It satisfactorily reproduced river discharge, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, groundwater level, and crop production of summer maize and winter wheat, correctly estimating-without any detailed statistical data-the amount of crop water use. The simulation showed that irrigation and industrial use of groundwater has a marked effect on the water dynamics in the NCP because the river water volume is smaller than that necessary for irrigation, industrial and, domestic water use. The model reproduced, reasonably well, the trend of groundwater degradation over the previous half century, including cone depressions occurring around bigger cities, which the author was unable to reproduce in previous research. The simulation also clarified that this water shortage is related to the low flow discharge of the Hai River into the ocean. Furthermore, the simulated result for the density current and solute transport processes clarified that these water cycle changes have caused serious seawater intrusion and a decrease of crop productivity in the coastal area, as shown by the gradient of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) estimated from satellite images. This study has important implications for the evaluation of ecosystems and environments located on the moving edge of freshwater and marine areas. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Here, we develop continental-scale pollen-based transfer functions for P-jja with weighted averaging-partial least squares (WA-PLS) regression and a Bayesian multinomial regression method. We apply these transfer functions to a set of fossil pollen data from monsoonal China for quantitatively reconstructing the P-jja changes over the last 9500 years. We compare the reconstructions with P-jja simulations from a coupled atmosphere-ocean-sea ice general circulation model (the Kiel Climate Model, KCM). The results of cross-validation tests for the transfer functions show that both the WAPLS model (r2 = 0.83, root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) = 112.11 mm) and the Bayesian model (r2 = 0.86, RMSEP = 107.67 mm) exhibit good predictive performance. We stack all P-jja reconstructions from northern China to a summary curve. The stacked record reveals that P-jja increased since 9500 cal. yr BP, attained its highest level during the Holocene summer monsoon maximum (HSMM) at similar to 7000-4000 cal. yr BP and declined to present. The KCM output and the reconstructions differ in the early-Holocene (similar to 9500-7000 cal. yr BP) where the model suggests higher P-jja than the reconstructions. Moreover, during the HSMM, the amplitude of the P-jja changes (similar to 20-60 mm above present) in simulations is lower than the reconstructed changes (similar to 70-110 mm above present). The rising (declining) P-jja patterns in reconstructions before (after) the HSMM are more pronounced and fluctuating than in simulations. Other palaeohydrological data such as lake-level reconstructions indicate substantial monsoon precipitation changes throughout the Holocene. Our results therefore show that the KCM underestimates the overall amplitude of the Holocene monsoon precipitation changes.

Stratification and temperature are important factors for drinking water production because they influence bio-geo-chemical processes and thus affect water quality. Most drinking water reservoirs have outlet structures that allow water to be withdrawn from different depths at variable rates. The thermal structure of these reservoirs can thus be managed actively by means of dynamic withdrawal schemes. Results We employed the hydro-physical General Lake Model to simulate the effects of different withdrawal strategies on temperatures and stratification in three German reservoirs. In particular, we assessed the potential of depth- and time-variable withdrawal to mitigate the impacts of climate change. We found that deep water temperatures (25 m below surface) and the end of summer stagnation are strongly controlled by the withdrawal regime. Specifically, the simulated impact of the withdrawal scheme was of the same order of magnitude as the observed impact of climate change over the last 30 years. However, the end of ice cover, the onset of summer stagnation, and near-surface temperatures (3 m depth) were rather insensitive to altered withdrawal strategies. Conclusions Our results suggest that an adaption of withdrawal depth and timing will partly compensate for the effects of climate change. Dynamic withdrawal should thus be considered as an integral part of future reservoir management strategies.					; Petzoldt, Thomas/C-6198-2009; Feldbauer, Johannes/NHP-9703-2025	Feldbauer, Johannes/0000-0002-8238-5375; Petzoldt, Thomas/0000-0002-4951-6468; Berendonk, Thomas/0000-0002-9301-1803; Kneis, David/0000-0002-6048-6984													2190-4707	2190-4715				MAR 18	2020	32	1							48	10.1186/s12302-020-00324-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12302-020-00324-7													WOS:000522184000002

Long-term evaluation of the impact of urbanization on chloride levels in lakes in a temperate region	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The application of road salts for winter de-icing of roadways in cold regions has been demonstrated to increase chloride (Cl) concentrations in nearby surface waters and have a negative impact on aquatic organisms and processes. In addition to toxicity to aquatic organisms, high concentrations of Cl in lakes can alter mixing processes, resulting in prolonged anoxic conditions and associated water quality degradation. Elevated concentrations of Cl in freshwater environments in cold regions is a well-documented phenomenon, but few studies have undertaken a long-term evaluation of the impact of urbanization on lakes. In this paper, nine lakes in the Halifax region of Nova Scotia, Canada, were monitored over 35 years to observe Cl concentrations prior to, during, and after urbanizing development. Cl concentrations were observed to increase in most study lakes over the monitoring period and all nine exhibited seasonal trending in response to winter de-icing activities. Six of the lakes achieved a steady-state Cl level after an initial increase in response to development activities, two are potentially still in transition, and one was unaffected by development activities. Watershed land use was found to be a good predictor of the springtime concentration of CI and can help to inform decision-making surrounding development activities. When the percent of developed land was 25% or more, the Cl concentrations tended to exceed Canadian freshwater quality guidelines for the protection of aquatic life.

Their diet was analyzed based on carcasses from incidental mortality of individuals in fishery gill net surveys in two different freshwater reservoirs (one deep, one shallow) in southern Poland during autumn migration (October - December). Five fish species were identified in the diet of the Great Crested Grebe and nine fish species were identified in the diet of the Red-throated Diver. The proportion of a particular fish species in diet was different between the studied bird species. The ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernua) was the most common prey in the diet of the Great Crested Grebe at both reservoirs. The diet of Red-throated Diver was dominated by roach (Rutilus rutilus) at the deep reservoir and the zander (Sander lucioperca) at the shallow one. The Red-throated Diver consumed larger fish than the Great Crested Grebe at both reservoirs.

Both stalagmite and lake records from northern China imply that there was a millennium-scale monsoon weakening event during the early Holocene, but whether this phenomenon is common across the Asian monsoon region remains unclear due to a paucity of records from southern China. We present results from U-Th dating and 433 stable carbon and oxygen isotope datapoints in order to investigate variations in the EASM during the early-mid Holocene in southern China. The results show that stalagmite delta O-18 values are relatively low in the period of 10.1-9.6 ka BP, indicating enhanced monsoon activity in the early Holocene. The stalagmite delta O-18 values for the period of 9.1-8.1 ka BP are characterized by a "w" type oscillation, indicating that there was a period of monsoon recession. In contrast, the period of 8.0-6.0 ka BP is characterized by relatively low, implying a strong monsoon. The results of our study indicate there was a millennial-scale weakening of the monsoon during the early Holocene in southern China. This suggests that the early Holocene monsoon weakening events are widespread throughout the monsoon region of eastern China.

J	Mitchell, RL; Sheldon, ND				Mitchell, Ria L.; Sheldon, Nathan D.			The ∼1100 Ma Sturgeon Falls paleosol revisited: Implications for Mesoproterozoic weathering environments and atmospheric CO2 levels	PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH												During the active rifting stage of the similar to 1100 Ma Midcontinental Rift in North America, alluvial sediments were deposited intermittently between basalt flows on the north and south shores of present day Lake Superior. At times of depositional quiescence, paleosols developed in both areas on the alluvial sediments and on the antecedent basalt. New results from the Sturgeon Falls paleosol in Michigan characterizing the weathering processes at the time of its formation indicate moderate maturity, high degrees of hydrolysis and leaching, and a low degree of salinization. Geochemical provenance indices indicate a homogeneous source for the paleosols, and in contrast to earlier work, there is little evidence for K metasomatism. As a result, atmospheric CO2 levels of 4-6x pre-industrial atmospheric levels were calculated using a mass-balance model. This result is consistent with previous calculations from nearly contemporaneous paleosols from the other side of the Keweenawan Rift and from the similar to 100 Ma younger Sheigra paleosol in Scotland. The calculated CO2 values are also consistent with the calculated weathering environment proxies that indicate weak to moderate weathering at this time frame and suggest that the higher greenhouse gas loads indicated by Paleoproterozoic paleosols had dissipated by the mid-late Mesoproterozoic.

J	Zhang, HC; Cao, ZH; Wang, GP; Zhang, HG; Wong, MH				Zhang, HC; Cao, ZH; Wang, GP; Zhang, HG; Wong, MH			Winter runoff losses of phosphorus from paddy soils in the Taihu Lake Region of South China	CHEMOSPHERE					International Conference on Environmental and Public Health Management	MAR 12-14, 2002	HONG KONG BAPTIST UNIV, KOWLOON, PEOPLES R CHINA		HONG KONG BAPTIST UNIV			A winter wheat field plot experiment was conducted on two types of paddy soils, from November, 2000 to June, 2001 to assess P losses to its surrounding watercourses by runoff in the Taihu Lake Region. Commercial NPK compound fertilizer and single superphosphate fertilizer were applied to furnish 0, 20, 80, and 160 kg P ha(-1). The experiments consisted of six replicates of each treatment in Changshu site and four replicates in Anzhen site, with a plot size of 5 x 6 m 2 in a randomized block design. Results revealed that the average concentration of dissolved P (DP), particulate P (PP), and total P (TP) in runoff water during the winter season was 0.13, 0.90 and 1.04 mg Pl(-1) respectively, from P20 plots in Anzhen site. While it was 0.67, 1.08 and 1.75 mg Pl(-1) respectively, from P20 plots in Changshu site. The seasonal TP load (mass loss) from P20 plot ranged from a low of 290.88 g P ha(-1) season(-1) to a high of 483.54 g P ha(-1) season-1, with a mean of 382.29 g P ha(-1) season(-1) in Anzhen, but from 444.92 to 752.21 g P ha(-1) season-1, with a mean of 539.13 g P ha(-1) season(-1) in Changshu. Both in Anzhen and Changshu. PP represented a major portion of the TP lost in runoff, the average PP/TP was about more than 80% in PO and P20 plot, but it was decreased with the increase of P rate. The average seasonal P loads (DP, PP, and TP) in Changshu were greater than in Anzhen although runoff volume in Anzhen (45 mm season(-1)) was more than in Changshu (36 mm season(-1)). This was probably associated with the differences of soil physical and chemical properties between the two sites. Phosphate fertilizer rate significantly affected P concentrations and P loads by runoff. Both the mean concentrations and the average seasonal P loads from the P80 plots were lower than from the P160 plots, but obviously higher than from the P20 and PO plots. There was no significant difference found between the P20 plots and the PO plots both in Anzhen and Changshu sites. It indicated that P loads by runoff would be greatly increased in 5-10 years due to the accumulation of soil P if 20 kg P ha(-1) applied each wheat season in this area. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Salmaso, N; Cerasino, L				Salmaso, Nico; Cerasino, Leonardo			Long-term trends and fine year-to-year tuning of phytoplankton in large lakes are ruled by eutrophication and atmospheric modes of variability	HYDROBIOLOGIA					16th workshop of the International-Association-for-Phytoplankton-Taxonomy-and-Ecology (IAP)	AUG 21-28, 2011	Trento, ITALY					This study demonstrated how the impact of eutrophication in a deep lake at the southern border of the Alps (Lake Garda) was regulated by specific modes of atmospheric circulation relevant for the Mediterranean area. At the decadal scale, nutrients and phytoplankton increased concurrently since the 1970s. At the annual scale, year-to-year fluctuations in nutrients and phytoplankton were controlled through a chain of causal factors centred on deeply penetrative mixing events determining an upward transport of phosphorus from the hypolimnion to the trophogenic layers. The extent of mixing was in turn controlled by lake and air winter temperature, which were ultimately regulated by the winter fluctuations of the East Atlantic pattern (EA). In its negative state, the EA shows an intense high pressure over the West Atlantic, causing a north-easterly air flow bringing cold air from continental Europe to Mediterranean, thus favouring greater lake mixing and nutrient fertilisation. Cyanobacteria (mostly Planktothrix rubescens) were the organisms which greatly benefitted from the long-term increase in phosphorus concentrations and the year-to-year fluctuations in surface phosphorus availability controlled by the EA. Given the same availability of phosphorus in the water column, positive winter EA phases weakened the eutrophication effects and phytoplankton development.

Investigating snowpack across scale in the northern Great Lakes-St. Lawrence forest region of Central Ontario, Canada	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												This study investigates scaling issues by evaluating snow processes and quantifying bias in snowpack properties across scale in a northern Great Lakes-St. Lawrence forest. Snow depth and density were measured along transects stratified by land cover over the 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 winters. Daily snow depth was measured using a time-lapse (TL) camera at each transect. Semivariogram analysis of the transect data was conducted, and no autocorrelation was found, indicating little spatial structure along the transects. Pairwise differences in snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE) between land covers were calculated and compared across scales. Differences in snowpack between forested sites at the TL points corresponded to differences in canopy cover, but this relationship was not evident at the transect scale, indicating a difference in observed process across scale. TL and transect estimates had substantial bias, but consistency in error was observed, which indicates that scaling coefficients may be derived to improve point scale estimates. TL and transect measurements were upscaled to estimate grid scale means. Upscaled estimates were compared and found to be consistent, indicating that appropriately stratified point scale measurements can be used to approximate a grid scale mean when transect data are not available. These findings are important in remote regions such as the study area, where frequent transect data may be difficult to obtain. TL, transect, and upscaled means were compared with modelled depth and SWE. Model comparisons with TL and transect data indicated that bias was dependent on land cover, measurement scale, and seasonality. Modelled means compared well with upscaled estimates, but model SWE was underestimated during spring melt. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the spatial representativeness of in situ measurements and the processes those measurements represent when validating gridded snow products or assimilating data into models.

Flushing of Veluwemeer has had a large impact on nutrient dynamics. Especially in the first winter, dilution was the main cause of changes in water quality. On a longer term the increase of the inactivation of phosphorus in sediments is important. Oscillatoria agardhii has been brought to the margins of its habitat. Three successive cold winters were an additional causal factor in the disappearance of Oscillatoria agardhii and the dominance of diatoms and green algae from 1985 onwards. Due to higher detritus and inorganic suspended matter concentrations transparency increased less than expected. Since 1985 chlorophyll only contributes for a small percentage to the transparency. In the present situation further improvement of the water quality of Veluwemeer is questionable, as the phosphorus concentration in the lake and the polder water is almost the same. Therefore it is recommanded to shift flushing operations, at least in the winter period, from Veluwemeer towards Wolderwijd.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY 15	1992	233	1-3					187	196		10.1007/BF00016107	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00016107													WOS:A1992JD64800019

COMPOSITION OF THE SEED BANK IN DRAWDOWN AREAS OF NAVIGATION POOL 8 OF THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												In an effort to enhance aquatic plant production and habitat diversity on the Upper Mississippi River (UMR), resource managers considered water level reduction as a management tool to increase the area of emergent and submersed aquatic vegetation by natural seed germination. To quantify the availability of seed, we assessed the potential seed bank of selected areas of Navigation Pool 8 of the UMR from substrate samples collected in spring 2000. We tested these samples for viable seed content under four hydrologic conditions: dry, moist, shallow flooded and submerged. Forty-seven species were identified in the seed bank, including 27 obligate wetland, 10 facultative wetland and 7 upland species. Dominant taxa within the seed bank included Sagittaria spp., Lindcrnia dubia. Zosterella dubia, Cyperus spp., Eragrostis spp. and Leersia oryzoides. Of the four hydrologic treatments, moist substrates had the greatest species diversity and were the most productive, yielding an average density of 1420 seedlings m(-2). Emergent and submersed aquatic species were widely distributed, each type occurring in more than 90% of the samples. Timing of seedling germination varied among species and has implications for scheduling drawdowns to promote establishment of desired species. Seed bank results were correlated with the vegetation response on substrates exposed during a reduction of water levels of Pool 8 during summer 2001. Experimentally determining the composition and viability of seed banks from drawdown areas provides information useful in predicting the types of vegetation that may develop on exposed substrates. Further, these findings provide resource managers a better understanding of the potential						Kenow, Kevin/0000-0002-3062-5197													1535-1459					FEB	2009	25	2					194	207		10.1002/rra.1118	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.1118													WOS:000263489200007
J	Ji, XL; Xia, SS; Zhou, LZ				Ji, Xianglin; Xia, Shanshan; Zhou, Lizhi			Impacts of reclamation and aquaculture on the wintering waterbird assemblage at a floodplain lakeshore based on multidimensional diversity	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												The floodplain lakeshores have pronounced hydrological and topographical gradients, high habitat heterogeneity, and abundant food sources, providing suitable habitats for wintering and stopping waterbirds. However, certain areas are experiencing ecosystem changes along the lakeshore due to lake development. Huayanghe lakes are composed of several shallow lakes, located in the middle and lower Yangtze River floodplain, which are important wetlands for the waterbirds on the East Asian -Australasian Flyway. In recent decades, intensive reclamation and aquaculture have transformed the lakeshore into an ecosystem characterized by three distinct wetland types: lakes, fishponds, and paddy fields. Changes in habitats have considerable impacts on lakeshore biodiversity, with waterbirds exhibiting particularly high sensitivity to changes in wetlands. Therefore, to support waterbird community conservation, the consequences of anthropogenic activities on lakeshore waterbird diversity must be elucidated. Integrated studies of taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity and dissimilarity can provide a multifaceted indication of the assemblage patterns and dynamics of lakeshore waterbird communities under anthropogenic disturbance. Accordingly, in the current study, we examined the diversity and dissimilarity of waterbirds in the lake, fishpond, and paddy field wetlands during wintering periods. The taxonomic and functional diversity of waterbird communities was significantly lower in fishponds and paddy fields than in lakes. Phylogenetic diversity was also significantly lower in paddy fields than in lakes; however no significant differences were observed between fishponds and lakes. The community 's taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional dissimilarities were significantly lower in fishponds and paddy fields than in lakes, and lower in paddy fields than in fishponds. The temporal dynamics of the waterbird community diversity and dissimilarity varied significantly, with larger fluctuations in fishponds and lakes than in paddy fields. Specifically, lakes exhibited an initial increase and subsequent decrease, while fishponds and paddy fields showed a continuous, gradually declining trend. During the early wintering period, the dissimilarity of waterbird communities was higher in fishponds and paddy fields than in lakes. Additionally, the diversity and dissimilarity of waterbird communities increased in fishponds during the wintering period. In summary, artificial wetlands can provide temporary habitat for waterbirds; however, the reclamation of lakeshores into fishponds and paddy fields has reduced the wetland capacity to maintain waterbird diversity. These findings provide critical insights to inform the design of effective management strategies for waterbirds and wetland habitats on floodplain lakes.

In both years, a mid-summer bloom of G. planctonica was followed by the rapid growth of A. granulata. Laboratory experiments in which A. granulata was grown in cellfree filtrate of a G. planctonica culture revealed that the growth of A. granulata was stimulated in the G. planctonica-treated medium relative to controls. This effect was detected when dormant A. granulata cells were used as the source culture for the experiment but not when actively growing cells were used. Dormant A. granulata also grew more rapidly in river water collected after the 2010 G. planctonica bloom relative to river water collected before the bloom. These results suggest that the summer bloom of A. granulata in the river was stimulated by G. planctonica. This relationship can be described as stimulated rejuvenation, an interaction where the transition of an algal resting stage into active growth is triggered by exposure to another species.																			0022-3646	1529-8817				APR	2015	51	2					332	342		10.1111/jpy.12277	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpy.12277								26986528					WOS:000352617500013
J	Czernecki, B; Ptak, M				Czernecki, Bartosz; Ptak, Mariusz			The impact of global warming on lake surface water temperature in Poland - the application of empirical-statistical downscaling, 1971-2100	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The paper presents historical (1971-2015) and scenario-based (2006-2100) changes in surface water temperatures in 10 lakes of Poland. The analysis of historical measurement (1971-2015) showed that mean annual lake surface water temperature (LSWT) was characterised by an increasing tendency by 037 degrees C dec(-1) on average. and was higher by 0.01 degrees C dec(-1) than air temperature in the analogical period. The highest increase in LSWT was recorded in spring months (April, May) and in summer (July). The future changes in LSWT was based on simulations of 33 AOGCMs available in the scope of CMIP5 project for RCPs: 2.6. 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5. The developed empirical-statistical downscaling models (ESD) use the air temperature field as predictors. with consideration of autocorrelation for two preceding months. ESD models are characterised by high quality of reconstruction of water temperatures in the historical period, with correlation from 0.82 (December, February) to 0.93 (July). The future OOPS scenarios for the period 2006-2100 assume an increase in air temperature at the end of the 21st century from +1.8 degrees C (RCP 2.6) to +15.1 degrees C (RCP 8.5) in reference to the period 1971-2005. According to the downscaling models. this corresponds to an increase in water temperature in the analysed lakes ranging from +1.4 degrees C (RCP 2.6) to +4.2 degrees C (RCP 8.5) in the years 2081-2100. respectively, with evident variability between the adopted emission paths beginning from the period 2041-2060. At a monthly scale. water temperature will increase the slowest in February (2081 -2100: RCP 2.6=+0.5 degrees C, RCP 8.5=+1.8 degrees C). The highest increase in temperature will occur from May to August (RCP 8.5=+6 degrees C in June). Substuitial effects of transformations of the thermal regime of lakes are already observed today, e.g. in the reduction of the ice season length. According to developed scenarios, a further considerable increase in water temperature will be the primary factor determining the transformation of lake ecosystems and also will reduce water resources per capita. Therefore, it should constitute for the possibly fast development of multidisciplinary concepts of mitigation policy to potential impact of climate change.					; Ptak, Mariusz/O-3217-2015	Czernecki, Bartosz/0000-0001-6496-1386; Ptak, Mariusz/0000-0003-1225-1686													1129-5767	1723-8633					2018	77	2					330	348		10.4081/jlimnol.2018.1707	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2018.1707													WOS:000456091500016

Evaluation of survival and cost to harvestable age of stocked fall fingerling walleye (Sander vitreus) in Northern Wisconsin Lakes	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Walleye Sander vitreus are culturally and recreationally important in Wisconsin, USA and have experienced population declines in some lakes due to reduced natural recruitment. In 2013, the Wisconsin legislature implemented the Wisconsin Walleye Stocking Initiative, a statewide rehabilitation effort to help declining walleye populations through increased stockings of fall fingerling walleye (150-250 mm). Our objectives were to: (1) test for differences in natural mortality (M) of stocked walleye among stocking densities (12.4, 24.7, 37.1 fish/ha), lake recruitment status (some natural recruitment or no natural recruitment), and lake conductivity (surrogate for lake productivity); (2) estimate cost to harvestable age (i.e., age-4); and (3) compare predicted adult walleye abundance among lakes across various stocking densities in relation to Wisconsin walleye adult abundance standards (i.e., naturally reproducing population & GE;7.4 adults/ha, "fishable" population & GE; 3.7 adults/ ha). Fall fingerling stocked walleye M was lowest in lakes with some natural recruitment, with medium-low and high conductivities, and stocked at 24.7 and 37.1 fish/ha, respectively. Using a mixed-effects model, fall fingerling M was negatively related to stocking density but not lake recruitment status or conductivity. No conditions resulted in the naturally reproducing population density standard to be met after multiple stockings. Two to four stocking events were required to achieve the "fishable" population standard, depending on lake conditions. When estimating cost to harvestable age, lakes stocked at 24.7 fish/ha generally had the best survival resulting in the lowest cost to age-4 ($17.70 - $35.41/fish). Lakes stocked at 12.4 fish/ha had the highest cost to age-4 ($91.17 - $182.34/fish). Juvenile walleye survival from age-0 to age-1 was dependent on lake conductivity and recruitment status, with lakes stocked at 24.7 fish/ha providing the lowest cost to age-4. Our results may inform science-based decision making and best-case scenario stocking rates to increase the probability of reestablishing walleye natural recruitment.

We measured evapotranspiration (ET) and surface energy fluxes over the riparian shrub Myricaria squamosa Desv., which is widely distributed on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau but has not been studied until now. The results indicated that annual ET was 390 mm and 503 mm for the period of 2010 to 2011 and 2011 to 2012, respectively, which was higher than the amount of precipitation during the same period. Cumulative ET was lower than the cumulative reference evapotranspiration during the entire experimental period, whereas ET in August was higher than reference evapotranspiration. ET in the growing season occupied over 80% of annual ET with a maximum daily ET of 7.2 mm d(-1), and the ET in the non-growing season was quite low because of the frozen soil. In general, temperature and net radiation were the key variables controlling daily ET rates for M. squamosa. Annual sensible heat flux (H) consumed 60% of net radiation (R-n) and latent heat flux (LE) 40% during the three years of the study. LE occupied the main part of R-n from July to September. H was the highest in May and June, then sunk in the mid-growing season, and rebounded the other peak at late September and early October. Daily ground heat flux was positive from April to mid-September, and it was an important heat source of land surface in the winter and spring. This study highlighted that as an alpine riparian ecosystem in a semiarid region, ET and surface energy partitioning of the M. squamosa community are strongly affected by the freeze-thaw cycle, groundwater fluctuation, precipitation pulses and soil water content. We speculate that climate warming has a significant impact on ET process and surface energy partitioning of the M. squamosa community by influencing the freeze-thaw cycle and soil water content.

J	Burla, H; Ribi, G				Burla, H; Ribi, G			Density variation of the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha in Lake Zurich, from 1976 to 1988	AQUATIC SCIENCES												A population explosion of the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha in Lake Zurich in the early seventies was followed by a decline, most noticeably in the littoral zone (Burla and Lubini-Ferlin, 1976). To check for further density changes, zebra mussels were counted every winter from 1978 to 1988, and larval settlement was recorded every summer from 1976 to 1988. During this period, mussel densities ranged from 11 to 1500 ind. m(-2); juvenile densities from 11 to 108 ind. cm(-2). Counts of newly settled juveniles and counts of established mussels were positively correlated between years. This suggests that the number of larvae in any given year depends on the size of the breeding population of mussels. Juvenile counts from different sites were more similar than mussel counts in any given year, indicating that within-lake dispersal of larvae is high. In both newly settled juveniles and established mussels, density variation occurred in what appeared to be two full cycles of 5 years. Mussel densities were positively correlated with total bird counts of three known predators of D. polymorpha, the Coot (Fulica atra), Tufted duck (Aythya fuligula), and Pochard (A. ferina). Higher mussel densities were observed near Zollikon and Goldbach than at other sampling sites. This may be a consequence of a steeper, stonier slope of the lake bed at these sites. Twenty-eight years after it was first recorded in Lake Zurich, D. polymorpha appears to be firmly established in the lake.																			1015-1621	1420-9055					1998	60	2					145	156		10.1007/PL00001315	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/PL00001315													WOS:000073804200005

Abrupt weakening of the summer monsoon in northwest India ∼4100 yr ago	GEOLOGY												Climate change has been suggested as a possible cause for the decline of urban centers of the Indus Civilization similar to 4000 yr ago, but extant paleoclimatic evidence has been derived from locations well outside the distribution of Indus settlements. Here we report an oxygen isotope record of gastropod aragonite (PO.) from Holocene sediments of paleolake Kotla Dahar (Haryana, India), which is adjacent to Indus settlements and documents Indian summer monsoon (ISM) variability for the past 6.5 k.y. A4% increase in delta O-18(a) occurred at ca. 4.1 ka marking a peak in the evaporation/precipitation ratio in the lake catchment related to weakening of the ISM. Although dating uncertainty exists in both climate and archaeological records, the drought event 4.1 ka on the northwestern Indian plains is within the radiocarbon age range for the beginning of Indus de-urbanization, suggesting that climate may have played a role in the Indus cultural transformation.					; Petrie, Cameron/ABB-8528-2021	Dixit, Yama/0000-0002-0700-5918; Hodell, David/0000-0001-8537-1588; Petrie, Cameron/0000-0002-2926-7230; 													0091-7613	1943-2682				APR	2014	42	4					339	342		10.1130/G35236.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/G35236.1													WOS:000333244300020
