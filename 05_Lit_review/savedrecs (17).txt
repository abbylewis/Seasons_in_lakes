Estimating long-term denudation rates through these conventional methods requires the assumption that the surficial processes have remained constant throughout time. Since the earth's surface has been obliterated throughout the geological time by climate, tectonics, or the recent anthropogenic activities, the present rate of change may not represent past processes. This study presents changes in denudation rate using the Be-10 (meteoric)/Be-9 ratio for the past 600 years from Anshupa Lake sediment record in the core monsoon zone of India. Paleodenudation rate estimated using Be-10 (meteoric)/Be-9 varies from 392 +/- 42 to 95 +/- 6 t/km(2)/yr. Intense Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) during the periods of solar maxima, which caused decadal-scale floods in the Indian sub-continent, favored a higher rate of denudation than the periods of solar minima, that experienced droughts in the Indian sub-continent due to weakening of ISM.

Included in this are the behavior of the snow cover of the ice and adjacent tundra and lake system; concurrent studies of mass balance of the sea ice and lake ice; interaction of shortwave radiation with the shore-fast ice and the adjacent land surfaces; evolution of the area coverage and distribution of the various surface types; and the resulting regional albedo values. Maximum snow depths decreased during 2000-02 from 0.38 m to 0.26m. Ice-melt rates in 2001 were 0.05 and 0.028 m d(-1) at the top and bottom of the sea ice respectively, two to three times larger than observations from the central Arctic. Detailed surface results combined with aircraft photography were used to calculate regional albedos for the late spring and early summer of 2001. Values ranged from 0.8 for all cold snow-covered surfaces to approximately 0.4 for melting sea ice and lake ice vs 0.18 for bare tundra. Regional and surface-based values of cumulative shortwave radiation entering the ice were consistent, indicating that albedo sampling on a scale of 200 m can provide a useful representation for regional sea-ice albedo.

J	EVERITT, DA				EVERITT, DA			AN ECOLOGICAL STUDY OF AN ANTARCTIC FRESH-WATER POOL WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO TARDIGRADA AND ROTIFERA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Deep Lake Tarn is a small pool in the Vestfold Hills, Antarctica, which freezes solid seasonally. When free water is present, rotifers, tardigrades, nematodes, protozoans and bacteria are active and are mainly associated with an algal mat composed of cyanophytes, chlorophytes chrysophytes and a pyrrophyte. Hypsibius arcticus (Murray) (Tardigrada) reached a maximum density of 470 individuals/g wet weight of algal mat and individuals took about 3 mo. to reach full size. A new species of Isohypsibius was recorded and will be described elsewhere. Tardigrades overwintered in their cryptobiotic state. The population density of bdelloid rotifers changed cyclically, peaking at 3 wk intervals during summer. They also overwintered in their cryptobiotic state. Monogonont rotifers appeared only in summer and species succession occurred. They are thought to overwinter as resting eggs. Two bdelloid rotifers, Macrotrachela quadricornifera (Milne) and Mniobia russeola (Zelinka) and 1 monogonont rotifer Ptygura sp., are new records for continental Antarctica.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1981	83	2					225	237		10.1007/BF00008270	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008270													WOS:A1981ME24600005

This study aimed to analyze the hydrological characteristics and water quality of the PDR and assess its spatial and seasonal eutrophication status changes using the Korean-type trophic quality index (TSIKO) and the seasonal Mann-Kendall Test (SMK). The PDR's water was graded "good" in terms of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and "fair" for COD, total phosphorous (TP), and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), according to Korean water quality standards. COD and Chl-a had a significant positive monotonic relationship. According to the TSIKO calculations, the trophic state of the PDR was mesotrophic, but eutrophic during the summer season. TSIKO (Chl-a) in summer tended to increase with a slope value of 0.22 mg/m3/year. The main causes of eutrophication in the PDR were proposed to be TP and phytoplankton overgrowth. Therefore, lake and reservoir functions need to be assessed, and solutions that can effectively protect them from excessive eutrophication to ensure sustainable clean water use and protect freshwater ecosystems need to be found.																				2071-1050				JAN	2024	16	1							373	10.3390/su16010373	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su16010373													WOS:001140463900001

In this study, the partial pressure of CO2 in the surface water of the Dianshan Lake was investigated in-situ in August 2011. The average pCO(2) in the study area was 2300 mu atm and fluctuated within the range of 989-5000 mu atm. pCO(2) showed a reverse trend to the variations of pH and DO in the surface water of the Dianshan Lake. The water to air diffusion flux of CO2 of the upstream, middle lake and downstream were respectively 63, 33 and 14 mmol/m(2)/ d. On average, the diffusion flux of CO2 of the whole lake was 31 mmol/ m(2)/d. Consequently, our results show that during the sampling season, the Dianshan Lake appears to be a great source of CO2. It is also demonstrated that respiration could be the dominant biochemical reaction in the Dianshan Lake in summer.

J	Peng, F; Effler, SW				Peng, Feng; Effler, Steven W.			Characterizations of calcite particles and evaluations of their light scattering effects in lacustrine systems	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Characterization of autochthonously produced calcite particles, along with the associated heteronuclei, and evaluation of their effects on light scattering, are advanced for lacustrine waters. This is supported by ( 1) direct measurement of minerogenic particle populations from 12 northeastern U.S. lakes with scanning electron microscopy interfaced with automated image and X-ray analyses (SAX), and (2) application of the previously tested SAX-Mie-theory approach to resolve the contributions of calcite vs. allochthonous minerogenic particles to particulate scattering and backscattering coefficients (b(p) and b(bp)), and (3) comparison with organic contributions estimated through empirical bio-optics models. Intervals of substantial contributions of calcite to b(p) and b(bp), described as "whiting events," are demonstrated for these study lakes. Organic particles, apparently from two size ranges, likely corresponding to pico- and nanocyanobacteria, are found to serve as the primary heteronuclei for the calcite precipitation. The coating of these particles with calcite within the upper waters of the study lakes remained thin. The calculated relative increases in b(bp) were substantially more than for b(p) because of the greater effect of the higher refractive index (i.e., n) of calcite for the former. Differences in n values for calcite reported in the literature are a source of noteworthy uncertainty in associated b(bp) estimates. Nine years of spring-fall monitoring in Cayuga Lake, New York, documented major interannual variations in the whiting events with respect to timing, magnitude of the scattering signatures, and the sizes of heteronuclei. Whiting events can have major effects on commonly monitored optical features, including Secchi depth and remote sensing reflectance.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2017	62	2					645	664		10.1002/lno.10451	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10451													WOS:000397875700017

In Central Italy, the Fiume-Vento karstic complex represents the most important active hypogenic cave system hosting several interconnected lakes where groundwater moves towards sulfidic springs emerging along the Sentino Stream. Stratification and dilution phenomena between freshwater and sulfidic water occur in many underground lakes, even if they remain still open if these processes are driven by stream-aquifer interaction or dripping water. The speleological knowledge coupled with geochemical surveys can help study groundwater circulation in the karst system's inner and outer portions. The geochemical analyses on water samples taken along the Sentino Stream, inside the caves (dripping and lakes water) and in sulfidic springs allow establishing the origin of the dilution water in the dripping water. However, stream-aquifer interactions cannot be excluded during flood events. Using the tracer masse balance method (chloride and sodium ions), the discharge of the sulfidic springs ranges between 65 and 11 L/s. The results presented in this study may help understand groundwater circulation and dilution phenomena in other karst systems characterised by sulfuric acid speleogenesis type.

The concentration and distribution of soluble reactive phosphate (SRP), dissolved organic P (DOP) and particulate P (PP) in water column, as well as organic P (OP), inorganic P (IP), exchangeable P (Ex-P), BD -P (redox-sensitive P), NaOH-P (P bound to Fe and Al oxyhydroxides) and HCl-P (P bound to Ca) in sediment were in-vestigated. Results showed that the seasonal average concentrations of total phosphorus (TPw) in water column ranged from 0.048 to 0.130 mg center dot L-1, with the highest in summer and the lowest in winter. P in water column was predominantly present in dissolved state, with the similar proportions of SRP and DOP. SRP decreased apparently in midstream, where the phytoremediation was applied extensively. PP content obviously increased in non-phytoremediation area in downstream, due to visitor activity and sediment resuspension. Total phosphorus (TPs) in sediments was between 352.9 and 1331.3 mg center dot kg-1, with average 365.7 mg center dot kg-1 of IP and 382.8 mg center dot kg-1 of OP. Among IP, HCl-P had the highest proportion, followed by BD-P, NaOH-P and Ex-P. OP was significantly higher in phytoremediation areas than that in non-phytoremediation areas. Coverage of aquatic plants was positively correlated with TP, OP, BAP, while it was negatively correlated with BD-P. Hydrophyte stabilized and conserved active P in sediment and prevented release of active P. Moreover, hydrophyte increased NaOH-P and OP contents in sediment through regulating the abundance of phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria (PSB), such as Lentzea and Rhizobium. Four sources were identified through two multivariate statistical models. RW and runoff were the dominant sources of P ac-counting for 52.09 %, which mainly contributed to P in sediment especially IP.

Epidemiological studies of Biomphalaria snails and their infection status with S. mansoni is vital for public health planning. This study aimed to assess the spatial and seasonal abundance of Biomphalaria snails as well as their infection status with S. mansoni around Lake Tana, northwest Ethiopia. Malacological survey was conducted from January 2021 to December 2021 in ten different collection sites in and around Lake Tana. Snail collection was performed for 20 min from each collection site seasonally (four times in a year) using a standard scoop and handpicking from aquatic vegetation. All collected snails were carefully examined based on their morphological features and all live Biomphalaria snails were subjected to cercariae shedding experiment. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the prevalence of S. mansoni infection and its relationship with snail collection sites and seasons. A total of 3886 freshwater snails were collected from ten collection sites around Lake Tana. Out of the total snails collected, 1606 (41.3%; 95% CI 39.77-42.89%) were Biomphalaria spp. The highest (374) and the lowest numbers (98) of Biomphalaria snails were collected from Shinne River and Qunzela Lakeshore, respectively. Out of the 1375 live Biomphalaria snails, 14.4% (95% CI 12.59-16.37%) snails shed cercariae, but only 4.87% (95% CI 3.79-6.15%) were cercariae of S. mansoni. The infection prevalence of S. mansoni ranged from 10.59% at the Cherechera site to 1.49% at Gumara River. Biomphalaria snail infections with S. mansoni cercariae were observed throughout the season, the highest and the lowest infection rates being in the spring and summer seasons. Significant differences in the prevalence of S. mansoni infection in Biomphalaria snails were observed across study sites and seasons (p < 0.05). Biomphalaria snails were the most abundant freshwater snails found in nearly all of snail collection sites throughout the year. It was revealed that nearly five percent of Biomphalaria snails were infected with S. mansoni cercariae. This study highlights the importance of appropriate snail control strategies to support the ongoing prevention and control of schistosomiasis around Lake Tana.

The system provides an optimal year-round treatment/reuse/disposal plan, which maximizes the wastewater reuse for irrigation, meets the applicable minimum municipal wastewater treatment requirements and observes the water quality standards of receivers with the minimum treatment costs. The solution is dynamic in the sense that varying monthly design values can be assigned to the input variables used in the computation of irrigation requirements, assimilative capacity of receivers and performance of natural systems. The above procedure shows that the use of multiple receivers over the year is often highly advantageous; combining for example the increased treatment efficiency and reuse potential for irrigation during summer with the increased assimilative capacity of a river during winter. The expert system incorporates a number of design and ambient quality models; for which graphical solutions have been developed, so as to enable manual application if desired. The entire procedure is implemented in an integrated computer program that facilitates and refines problem solution. The expert system provides interactive guidance for collecting the necessary field information. Finally, the results of a case study for the management of wastewaters from the six communities of the Municipality of Keramoti are presented.																			1606-9749		1-84339-457-X				2003	3	4					79	88		10.2166/ws.2003.0048	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/ws.2003.0048													WOS:000185639500008

Abrupt weakening of the Indian summer monsoon at 8.2 kyr BP	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												An oxygen isotope record of biogenic carbonate from paleolake Riwasa in northwestern (NW) India provides a history of the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) from similar to 11 to 6 kyr B.P. The lake was dry throughout the Late Glacial period when aeolian sands were deposited. Lacustrine sedimentation commenced in the early Holocene and the lake deepened significantly at similar to 9.4 kyr B.P., indicating a strengthening of the ISM in response to summer insolation forcing. This high lake stand was interrupted by an abrupt desiccation, which is marked by a 12-cm limestone hardground that formed during a period of sub-aerial exposure after similar to 8.3 kyr B.P. The base of the hardground surface coincides with the beginning of the '8.2-kyr B.P. cooling event' in the North Atlantic that has been associated with a glacial outburst flood and slowdown of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. The hardground provides robust evidence of a weakening of the ISM on the Indian subcontinent at similar to 8.2 kyr B.P., and supports previous results of a strong teleconnection between monsoon Asia and North Atlantic climate. Lacustrine sedimentation resumed at similar to 7.9 kyr B.P. suggesting the 8.2-kyr desiccation of paleolake Riwasa represented an abrupt response of the ISM to forcing from the North Atlantic.

Amnicola limosa (Gastropoda; Amnicolidae) held through the summer of 1982 in cages in acidic lakes (pH 5.78-5.89) grew slower (P. < 0.01) than those held in less acidic lakes (pH 6.03-6.84). The development of eggs of A. limosa in the laboratory was impaired at and below pH 5.0 and delayed at pH 5.5 relative to pH 6.0. The recruitment failure and elimination of A. limosa reported in acidifying lakes may be caused by reduced summer growth and (or) impaired development of the eggs. In contrast, Pisidium spp. (Bivalvia; Pisidiidae) do not appear to be adversely affected by low pH in the lakes in this study (pH 5.78-6.84). Caged P. equilaterale did not have reduced growth in the acidic lakes during the summer of 1982. P. casertanum and P. ferrugineum had only slightly reduced (P < 0.05) fecundity (number of extramarsupial larvae per adult) in acidic lakes relative to less acidic lakes samples in 1980.

J	Eser, P; Rosen, MR				Eser, P; Rosen, MR			Effects of artificially controlling levels of Lake Taupo, North Island, New Zealand, on the Stump Bay wetland	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The Stump Bay wetland is part of the South Taupo wetland, situated on the southern coast of Lake Taupo in the central North Island, New Zealand. The water level of Lake Taupo has been artificially controlled since 1941. The present study found that surface and subsurface water levels in the wetland are closely related to each other. These water levels are influenced mainly by rainfall and evapotranspiration (which is seasonal) in areas that are greater than c. 100 m landward from the lake edge, but by the lake level for areas in close proximity to the lake. The wetland is a discharge and/or through-flow area, and the general flow direction is towards the lake. The time lag for a groundwater rise in the eastern part of the wetland after rainfall was found to be 24 h. The artificial regulation of the lake level has led to a 2 cm rise in annual mean lake levels since 1950. However, when means are calculated for each month separately, the artificially controlled lake level is up to 20 cm higher in the summer than the pre-controlled summer levels. Significantly higher summer lake levels since 1941 are likely to have caused the observed increase in water levels in the Stump Bay wetland area. Further increases in lake levels are likely to decrease areas of native shrub communities and encourage spreading of the exotic shrub Salix cinerea. Lowering in lake levels may decrease areas of native low-stature vegetation, but the spreading of native shrub communities may be curbed by competing S. cinerea.					; Rosen, Michael/D-6091-2015	Rosen, Michael/0000-0003-3991-0522; 													0028-8330	1175-8805				JUN	2000	34	2					217	230		10.1080/00288330.2000.9516928	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.2000.9516928													WOS:000088394100003

High P release rates in eutrophic lakes are often attributed to anaerobic conditions and excessive P accumulation in lake sediments (NURNBERG 1988, SONDERGAARD et al. 2003). In eutrophic lakes, a substantial portion of P settles as biogenic P, but its contribution to hypolimnetic P accumulation is often neglected in conceptual and predictive models. The present study was carried out in eutrophic Lake Arendsee, Germany, where a high hypolimnetic P accumulation was observed during summer stratification. Mass balance calculations and sediment core investigations indicated that hypolimnetic P accumulation cannot be solely explained by the potentially mobile P inventory in the sediment (HUPFER & LEWANDOWSKI 2005). Without an additional supply from freshly settled particulate P and its rapid remobilization, the temporary P pool in the sediment would be exhausted in less than 3 months. The objective of the study was to determine particulate organic P species during and after sedimentation and their importance on P recycling. For that purpose, the P-binding forms of seston, trap material, and the uppermost sediment layer was investigated at a high temporal resolution during spring 2005. Phosphorus associated with a variety of biogenic compounds was resolved and quantified by P-31 NMR spectroscopy. This analytical tool has been increasingly used for limnological studies of the internal P cycle (AHLGREN et al. 2006, REITZEL et al. 2006).																			0368-0770		978-3-510-54080-8				2010	30		9				1389	+																WOS:000312418900017
J	Kushnir, Y; Stein, M				Kushnir, Yochanan; Stein, Mordechai			Medieval Climate in the Eastern Mediterranean: Instability and Evidence of Solar Forcing	ATMOSPHERE												This paper examines the hydroclimate history of the Eastern Mediterranean (EM) region during the 10th to 14th centuries C.E., a period known as the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), a time of significant historical turmoil and change in the region. The study assembles several regional hydroclimatic archives, primarily the Dead Sea reconstructed lake level curve together with the recently extracted deep-lake sediment record, the Soreq Cave speleothem record and its counterpart, the EM marine sediment record and the Cairo Nilometer record of annual maximum summer flood levels in lower Egypt. The Dead Sea record is a primary indicator of the intensity of the EM cold-season storm activity while the Nilometer reflects the intensity of the late summer monsoon rains over Ethiopia. These two climate systems control the annual rainfall amounts and water availability in the two regional breadbaskets of old, in Mesopotamia and Egypt. The paleoclimate archives portray a variable MCA in both the Levant and the Ethiopian Highlands with an overall dry, early-medieval climate that turned wetter in the 12th century C.E. However, the paleoclimatic records are markedly punctuated by episodes of extreme aridity. In particular, the Dead Sea displays extreme low lake levels and significant salt deposits starting as early as the 9th century C.E. and ending in the late 11th century. The Nile summer flood levels were particularly low during the 10th and 11th centuries, as is also recorded in a large number of historical chronicles that described a large cluster of droughts that led to dire human strife associated with famine, pestilence and conflict. During that time droughts and cold spells also affected the northeastern Middle East, in Persia and Mesopotamia. Seeking an explanation for the pronounced aridity and human consequences across the entire EM, we note that the 10th-11th century events coincide with the medieval Oort Grand Solar Minimum, which came at the height of an interval of relatively high solar irradiance. Bringing together other tropical and Northern Hemisphere paleoclimatic evidence, we argue for the role of long-term variations in solar irradiance in shaping the early MCA in the EM and highlight their relevance to the present and near-term future.					; Stein, Mordechai/AAJ-3200-2020	Kushnir, Yochanan/0000-0003-3312-5160; 														2073-4433				JAN	2019	10	1							29	10.3390/atmos10010029	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos10010029													WOS:000459133000029

J	Alzmann, N; Köhler, B; Maier, G				Alzmann, N; Köhler, B; Maier, G			Spatial distribution, food and activity of Gomphus pulchellus SELYS 1840 (Insecta; Odonata; Gomphidae) from a still water habitat	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												Distribution patterns of Gomphus pulchellus larvae in different sediments with different density of prey organisms were studied in the field in a small gravel pit lake in the south of Germany. Larval burrowing behaviour at different temperatures as well as food preference, consumption rates and activity were studied in laboratory experiments. In the study lake G. pulchellus larvae lived exclusively in places where macrophytes were present and in fine sediments (mean grain size <3 mm) with detritus cover. There was a significant positive correlation between larval density and density of food organisms suggesting that abundance of food is one of the determinants of larval distribution. In late autumn larvae migrated to deeper places probably to survive the winter. Low temperatures simulated in laboratory experiments did not induce larvae to burrow deeper. Larvae were always found in a sediment depth of 0.59-0.74 cm. Experiments with mixed prey showed that G. pulchellus larvae preferred tubificid worms and chironomid larvae over gammarids and ephemerid larvae. However, chironomid larvae which stayed in their tubes had a higher survival rate than those outside of tubes. Single-prey experiments showed that G. pulchellus larvae can prey not only on benthic species but also on Daphnia from the open water. Functional-response experiments showed that one G. pulchellus larva consumes a maximum of 2 to 3 tubificid worms or chironomid larvae per day, which corresponds to a maximum biomass (freshweight) of 5 to 30 mg per day. Video recordings of activity showed that G. pulchellus larvae cover long distances of up to 52 m per night on the substrate surface and that activity on the substrate surface started after midnight and ceased before sunrise. Consumption of zooplankton prey and high activity above the substrate is interpreted as an adaptation of G. pulchellus larvae to the life in still water habitats.																			1434-2944						1999	84	3					299	313																WOS:000081091900007

Water balance was estimated from precipitation and throughfall amounts, and measured outflow from the lake. The average water input into and outflow from the watershed-lake ecosystem was 1461 mm and 1271 mm (40 L km(-2) s(-1)), respectively, and the water residence time in the lake averaged 662 days. The ecosystem has been recovering from acidification since the late 1980s. Still, however, Certovo watershed was an average net source of 23 mmol m(-2) yr(-1) of SO(4)(2-). Nitrogen saturation of the watershed caused low retention of the deposited inorganic N (23% on average). After a dry summer in 2003 and a cold winter in 2004, the watershed became a net source of inorganic N (19 mmol m(-2) yr(-1)). Nitrogen transformations and SO(4)(2-) release were the dominant terrestrial sources of H(+) (81 and 47 mmol m(-2) yr(-1), respectively) and the watershed was a net source of 42 mmol H(+) m(-2) y(r)-(1). Ionic composition of tributaries showed seasonal variations with the most pronounced changes in NO(3)(-), base cations, DOC, and ionic Al (Al(i)) concentrations. The in-lake biogeochemical processes reduced the incoming H(+) by similar to 50% (i.e., neutralized on average 222 mmol H(+) m(-2) yr(-1), on a lake-area basis). Denitrification, SO(4)(2-) reduction, and photochemical and microbial decomposition of allochthonous organic matter were the most important in-lake H(+) consuming processes (215, 85, and 122 mmol H(+) m(-2) yr(-1), respectively), while hydrolysis of Ali was the dominant H(+) generating process (96 mmol H(+) m(-2) yr(-1)) in Certovo Lake. Photochemical liberation from organic complexes was an additional in-lake source of Al(i). The net in-lake retention or removal of nutrients (carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen, and silica) varied between 18% and 34% of their inputs.

Parasites may be particularly insidious as they are often introduced unintentionally, simultaneously with their hosts, and later transferred to species in the new location. Here we investigate the epizootic dynamics of the tapeworm Ligula intestinalis in the Hamiz reservoir, Algeria, and explore its effects on the cyprinid fish Barbus callensis. Regular sampling was conducted from October 2005 to February 2008 with intermittent surveys carried out until 2010. Five percent of the 566 specimens of B. callensis that were caught were infected, with the maximum number of parasites found in spring. There was no obvious difference in weight between uninfected fish and infected ones, and infection did not affect fish condition. However, infected fish were significantly longer than uninfected fish and had inhibited gonad development. The proportion of infected fish caught was significantly higher in year 1 and by the second winter, infection collapsed to zero. The Ligula infection thus appeared to have minimal ecological effects and be of a temporary nature, thus exhibiting an epizootic cycle. Taken together, our data indicates that this infection declined or even failed during our study period. Failure may be due to the specific genetic strain of Ligula, but invasive carp may also have been influential in both the introduction and subsequent decline of this parasite.					; Magellan, Kit/B-5528-2012	Magellan, Kit/0000-0002-0860-5931; 													1230-2821	1896-1851				MAR	2016	61	2					307	318		10.1515/ap-2016-0041	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/ap-2016-0041								27078654					WOS:000374972400013

We examined relationships among juvenile largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides size Structure, Occurrence of piscivory, and biomass relative to fish prey size Structure and biomass across Florida's latitudinal gradient to evaluate potential fish prey availability across a broad spatial scale of lakes. We sampled the 2003 and 2001. largemouth bass year-classes and potential fish prey in April/May (i.e., spring) and ill June/July (i.e., summer) in six Study lakes distributed from northern to southern Florida. Available prey to predator ratios (APT) decreased with increased fish size but indicated that prey resources were not limiting at any lake during either year (all AP:P > 8). We used a biomass-based food web model for our lake with the lowest APT we measured (similar to 9) to determine if bioenergetics-based predictions agreed with APT metric indications of the system's potential to Support a higher standing crop of largemouth bass. Food web simulations showed potential to increase the standing crop of adult largemouth bass population by Up to 30% at high stocking rates (i.e., 1.50 fish/ha), but stocking at high rates resulted in decreases to the natural portion of the adult population. Available prey metrics and simulations can provide information on the potential for stocking success, which could be used to improve the efficacy of stocking programs.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-06-6				2008	62						371	392																WOS:000263597300024

Over this period, smelt provided the greatest catch of commercial fish although its stock and catches have gradually decreased. At times, catches of smelt were quite variable with a cyclic character. Disappearance of smelt from catches in years 1973-1975 was the result of summer fish kill. Regression analysis revealed a significant negative effect of high temperature on the abundance of smelt stock, while the effect of water level was not significant. Our results suggest that critical factors for the smelt population are the absolute value of water temperature in the hottest period (>= 20 degrees C) of summer and the duration of this period. These weather parameters have increased in synchrony with smelt decline during the last 7 decades. There appeared to be a significant negative effect of hot summers on the abundance of smelt operating with a lag of one and 2 years, which can be explained by the short life cycle (mainly 1-2 years) of this species.

The causative agent is the SVC virus (SVCV), a member of the Sprivivirus genus, Rhabdoviridae family, and a List 1 pathogen notifiable by the World Organization for Animal Health. This study describes the diagnosis of an SVCV pathogen isolated in October 2015 from wild common carp inhabiting a natural lagoon in central Mexico. While neither an epidemic nor fish mortalities were reported, the collected killed specimens exhibited clinical signs of disease (e.g., exopthalmia, moderate abdominal distension and haemorrhaging, as well as internal haemorrhages and adhesions). Histological results of injuries were consistent with the pathology caused by SVCV. This finding was supported by the isolation of a virus in EPC and BF-2 cells and subsequent RT-PCR confirmation of SVCV. The phylogenetic analyses of partial SVCV glycoprotein gene sequences classified the isolates into the Ia genogroup. These findings make this the first report of SVCV detection in Mexico, extending the southern geographical range of SVCV within North America. However, since this pathogen was detected in fish inhabiting a natural body of water without tributaries or effluents, it is difficult to estimate the risk of SVCV for other wild/feral cohabitating cyprinid species in the lagoon. The status of this virus is also unknown for other bodies of water within this region.

The trout moved primarily in the nearshore area at an average velocity of 12.4 cm/s (similar to 0.25-0.3 body lengths/s). Five of the six fish made one more rapid (>1 body lengths/s) excursion across the lake, then continued moving in the nearshore zone. The trout were generally inactive, staying close (<50 m) to shore at night, and became more active near dawn; however, the highest average velocities were at dusk. They spent over 90% of their time in the top 3 m of the water column and 10% in brief (2 min), shallow (mean 6.6 m) dives. Dives occurred most frequently at dawn and during the day (0.8/h), less often near dusk (0.5/h), and seldom at night (0.1/h). The depth distribution and movement patterns suggest that the trout were feeding on Daphnia pulicaria during the day, in both nearshore and offshore areas, supplementing this diet with nearshore fishes such as prickly sculpins (Cottus asper). Predation on pelagic planktivores (longfin smelt, Spirinchus thaleichthyes, and juvenile sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka) was unlikely because the trout were primarily found nearshore and near the surface, whereas the planktivores are primarily offshore and closer to the bottom.																			0008-4301					JAN	1995	73	1					146	153		10.1139/z95-017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z95-017													WOS:A1995QY71100017
J	Watras, CJ; Morrison, KA; Regnell, O; Kratz, TK				Watras, CJ; Morrison, KA; Regnell, O; Kratz, TK			The methylmercury cycle in Little Rock Lake during experimental acidification and recovery	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The cycle of waterborne methylmercury (meHg) in Little Rock Lake is characterized by a period of accumulation during summertime (when the lake is warm and open to the atmosphere) and a period of decline during winter (when the lake is scaled by ice). We followed this cycle for 16 yr. during which time the lake was acidified with H,SO., and then allowed to recover naturally as part of a long-term field experiment on acidic rain. Mass balance Was used to quantify meHg sources and sinks during acidification and recovery. Although year-to-year variability in the Summertime accumulation of meHg was high during both acidified and de-acidified years (C.V. = 0.7 and 0.5, respectively), oil average 65% more meHg accumulated in the water column during acidification. Most of the meHg mass accumulated in the anoxic hypolimnion (> 70%). even though the hypolimnion constituted < 5% of the lake volume. In hypolininetic waters, we observed a direct correlation between the maximum meHg concentration and the sulfate deficit for each year (r(2) = 0.5-0.9) and a direct correlation between meHg and sulfide concentrations (r(2) = 0.7). Sulfide was directly related to dissolved organic carbon at concentrations between 300 and 600 mu mol L-1 carbon (C). Seasonal changes in waterborne H-(II), meHg, and sulfate reduction covaried with the atmospheric deposition of Hg-(II) and SO42-. Across all years, the interaction term [SO42- X Hg-(II)] explained 70% of the variation in the meHg accumulation rate during summer. These results indicate that meHg production was co-mediated by several simultaneously occurring processes that affect the supply of Hg-(II) substrate to the anoxic hypolimnion and the activity of methylating bacteria that are present there. They imply that meHa levels in lakes may respond to future changes in atmospheric Hg deposition in a rapid but complex way, modulated by environmental variables that can interact synergistically with Hg-(II) supply. Such variables include sulfate in acid rain, organic carbon ill terrestrial runoff, and temperature.																			0024-3590					JAN	2006	51	1					257	270		10.4319/lo.2006.51.1.0257	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2006.51.1.0257													WOS:000237399700026
J	Chikita, KA; Nishi, M; Fukuyama, R; Hamahara, K				Chikita, KA; Nishi, M; Fukuyama, R; Hamahara, K			Hydrological and chemical budgets in a volcanic caldera lake: Lake Kussharo, Hokkaido, Japan	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The contribution of groundwater output and input to lake chemistry was examined by estimating the hydrological and chemical budgets of a volcanic caldera lake, Lake Kussharo, Hokkaido, Japan. The lake level, meteorology, river water discharge and water properties were measured in the ice-covered period of February-March and in the open-water period of June-October in 2000. The inorganic chemistry was then analyzed for sporadically sampled surface water and hot spring water. The chemistry of lake water at pH of 6.91 -7.57 and EC25 (electric conductivity at 25 degreesC) of 29.2-32.7 mS/m appears to be controlled by the input of two types of hot spring water: the inflowing Yunokawa River (pH of 2.27-2.54 and EC25 of 197.8-258.0 mS/m) and groundwater discharging directly on the shore (pH of 7.13-8.32, water temperature of 35.0-46.5 degreesC and EC25 of 53.1-152.0 mS/m). Excluding the days with rainfall or a great change in lake level, the water budget in June-October gave a net groundwater input of - 7.41 to 2.97 m(3)/(S). A combination of the water budget with the chemical budget of two solutes, Na+ and Cl-, led to the best estimate of groundwater output, G(out), at 3.82 +/- 3.02 M-3/(S), the total fresh groundwater input, SigmaG(fresh), at 2.14 +/- 1.00 M-3/(S), and the total groundwater input of hot springs, SigmaG(spa), at 0.46 +/- 0.05 m(3)/(S). This is comparable to G(out) = 3.87 m(3)/(S), SigmaG(fresh) = 1.49 M-3/(s) and SigmaG(spa) = 0.41 m(3)/(s) during the ice-covered period. The chemical flux by the freshwater input plays an important role in the alkalinity of lake water, as does the chemical flux by the shoreline hot springs. The large groundwater output could occur by the leakage through the highly permeable, underground pumice, distributed from the east-to-south lake basin to southeast of the outlet.

J	Anderson, L				Anderson, Lesleigh			Holocene record of precipitation seasonality from lake calcite δ18O in the central Rocky Mountains, United States	GEOLOGY												A context for recent hydroclimatic extremes and variability is provided by a similar to 10 k.y. sediment carbonate oxygen isotope (delta O-18) record at 5-100 yr resolution from Bison Lake, 3255 m above sea level, in northwestern Colorado (United States). Winter precipitation is the primary water source for the alpine headwater lake in the Upper Colorado River Basin and lake water delta O-18 measurements reflect seasonal variations in precipitation delta O-18. Holocene lake water delta O-18 variations are inferred from endogenic sedimentary calcite delta O-18 based on comparisons with historic watershed discharge records and tree-ring reconstructions. Drought periods (i.e., drier winters and/or a more rain-dominated seasonal precipitation balance) generally correspond with higher calcite delta O-18 values, and vice-versa. Early to middle Holocene delta O-18 values are higher, implying a rain-dominated seasonal precipitation balance. Lower, more variable delta O-18 values after ca. 3500 yr ago indicate a snow-dominated but more seasonally variable precipitation balance. The middle to late Holocene delta O-18 record corresponds with records of El Nino Southern Oscillation intensification that supports a teleconnection between Rocky Mountain climate and North Pacific sea-surface temperatures at decade to century time scales.																			0091-7613	1943-2682				MAR	2011	39	3					211	214		10.1130/G31575.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/G31575.1													WOS:000287374900007
J	HAKE, M				HAKE, M			THE EFFECTS OF NEEDLE LOSS IN CONIFEROUS FORESTS IN SOUTH-WEST SWEDEN ON THE WINTER FORAGING BEHAVIOR OF WILLOW TITS PARUS-MONTANUS	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												The foraging behaviour of the willow tit Parus montanus was studied in two coniferous forest areas in SW Sweden, showing high (H) and low (L) percentages of needle loss, respectively. The needle loss is presumed to be accelerated mainly by air pollution and leads to (1) thinning of the tree canopies which could make birds easier for predators to detect and (2) reduction in the abundance of arthropods, which are important food of wintering passerines. Willow tits foraging in pine Pinus sylvestris in the H-area spent proportionally more time scanning for predators and less time handling prey than individuals in the L-area. In the H-area the tits also joined larger mixed-species flocks which included more species. These responses are interpreted as increased time stress in damaged forest but nevertheless the birds showed no tendency to lower their body mass. The results are discussed in relation to winter survival and the consequences of needle loss for bird populations in coniferous forests.																			0006-3207						1991	58	3					357	366		10.1016/0006-3207(91)90101-E	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0006-3207(91)90101-E													WOS:A1991GM24300008

Distinguishing between primary and reworked tephra is challenging, particularly in cryptotephra investigations that depend on identifying peaks of glass shard concentrations in sediment sequences rather than discrete macroscopic tephra layers. Here, we investigated macro-and cryptotephra in sediments of Lake Pupuke, New Zealand, to identify primary from reworked tephra and thus refine the record of tephra-fall events in the region over the last ca. 9 cal ka. Geochemical fingerprinting, stratigraphic correlation, C-14 ages and X-ray fluorescence and magnetic susceptibility core scanning were employed to filter out reworked tephra and thus establish a new Holocene tephrochronological framework for the region. Five primary macrotephra layers and 18 primary cryptotephra were identified. Confidence levels are attached to the newly identified cryptotephra, and geochemical characterization of well-dated rhyolite tephra was used to establish an associated age model. Our results suggest that Holocene tephra fall from both local and distal volcanoes affected Auckland more frequently than previously documented, with a possible average frequency of at least once every 424 years. Furthermore, the study demonstrates the importance of identifying the extent of post-depositional reworking to establish the veracity of the cryptotephra record.

Caizi Lake involves a natural reserve and two national wetland parks, accommodating winter migratory waterfowl over the middle and lower Yangtze River basin in China. However, the water transfer from the Yangtze River to the Huai River (YR-HR water transfer) has modified the winter hydrological conditions of Caizi Lake, negatively affecting wintertime waterfowl habitats. Hence, conserving wintertime waterfowl habitats necessitates knowledge of the dynamical mechanisms behind the impacts of YR-HR water transfer on wintertime waterfowl habitats and adaptive measures. Here we developed a machine learning model, the normalized difference vegetation index, and on-spot observatory datasets such as the spatial distribution of waterfowl species and underwater topography of Caizi Lake. We found that the rising winter water level of Caizi Lake encroaches on winter waterfowl habitat with extremely high suitability. Meanwhile, rising water levels reduced waterfowl food sources. Thus, rising water levels due to YR-HR water transfer deteriorated waterfowl living conditions over Caizi Lake. Therefore, we proposed adaptive measures to alleviate these negative effects, such as water level regulation, artificial feeding of waterfowls, restoration and reconstruction of contiguous mudflats, grass flats. This study highlights human interferences with waterfowl habitats, necessitating biodiversity conservation at regional scales.					cui, lijuan/AAX-7996-2021; Wang, Xiaoyuan/AAL-9619-2021; Zhou, Lizhi/AAF-4535-2021; Singh, Ramesh/Z-3814-2019														0048-9697	1879-1026				NOV 25	2024	953								176020	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.176020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.176020		SEP 2024						39236833					WOS:001312687400001
J	Parker, BR; Schindler, DW				Parker, BR; Schindler, DW			Cascading trophic interactions in an oligotrophic species-poor alpine lake	ECOSYSTEMS												Non-native brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) were eradicated from alpine Bighorn Lake, Alberta, Canada, to test whether strong cascading trophic interactions (CTI) can occur in oligotrophic, high seston C:P, species-poor lakes. Fishless alpine Pipit Lake was used as a reference ecosystem. Bighorn Lake zooplankton biomass increased from 0.14:I relative to Pipit Lake before fish removal began in 1997 to 0.6:I afterwards due to an increase in the abundance of adult cyclopoid copepods beginning in 1997 and the reappearance of Daphnia middendorffiana in 1998. Following the reappearance of Daphnia, Bighorn Lake total phytoplankton biomass fell from 64:I relative to Pipit Lake to 0.9:I. Over the same periods Bighorn Lake:Pipit Lake chlorophyll-alpha ratios declined from 2.4:I to 1.6:I, although the decrease was not statistically significant. Mid-summer Secchi disc depth in Bighorn Lake increased from 3.1 m before manipulation to 9.2 m, the maximum depth of the lake, in 2001 and 2002. Increased transparency was most likely due to increased filtration of suspended inorganic particles from the water column by higher abundances of large zooplankton. Post-manipulation increases in dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), DIN:total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) ratio and declines in TDP in Bighorn Lake were not attributable to ecosystem manipulation, similar changes were observed in reference Pipit Lake. We conclude that strong pelagic CTI, expressed as change in total phytoplankton biomass and largely mediated by Daphnia, can occur in oligotrophic, high seston C:P, species-poor ecosystems. However, strong CTI responses in phytoplankton biomass may lag trophic manipulation by several years.

However, our understanding of pre -modern fishing traditions has been hampered by a lack of written sources, as well as a scarcity of archaeological data. However, a recent excavation and comprehensive dendrochronological analysis of a fish trapping enclosure system in Lake Nord-Mesna (520 masl.), in the boreal forests of inland Norway, has provided unique insight into freshwater fishing traditions, techniques and organization. The excavated structure, believed to be a fish weir with lath screen traps set into shallow water, was established in the late 1200s. In the following years it was regularly maintained in the spring/early summer. The last documented repair was in 1343. Its abandonment is interpreted as resulting from a recession likely induced by factors such as plague and climatic deterioration, that affected inland areas of Scandinavia in the 1300s. These results provide archaeological evidence of medieval utilization of effective enclosure traps in the region. This contradicts the prevailing notion that this form of fishing was later introduced by Forest Finns who migrated to the area in the 17(th) century. In addition, the findings give new and significant information about the organization and practice of medieval fishing in inland Scandinavia.																			0015-7813	1404-9430					2024	119	1																						WOS:001224375300008

The objective of this study was to assess long-term changes in water quality (nutrient and sediment concentrations) following the distressed watershed rules package instituted in 2011. Since that time, a variety of rules (e.g., winter manure ban) and best management practices (cover crops, manure storage or transfers, buffers, etc.) have been implemented. We used a general linear model to assess variation in total suspended solids, particulate phosphorus, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate N, and total Kjeldahl nitrogen concentrations from daily Chickasaw Creek (drains similar to 25% of watershed) samples spanning 2008 to 2016. Parameters were related to flow (higher values during high flows), timing (lower values during winter months), and the implementation of the distressed watershed rules package (lower values following implementation). Overall, reductions following the distressed designation for all parameters ranged from 5 to 35% during medium and high flow periods (with exception of SRP). Reductions were even more pronounced during winter months covered by the manure ban, where all parameters (including SRP) exhibited decreases at medium and high flows between 20 and 60%. While the reductions seen in this study are significant, concentrations are still highly elevated and continue to be a problem. We are optimistic that this study will serve to inform future management in the region and elsewhere.																			0047-2425	1537-2537				JAN-FEB	2018	47	1					113	120		10.2134/jeq2017.08.0338	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2017.08.0338								29415096					WOS:000422777100012

This process, being tightly linked to primary production, needs to be understood within the context of summer eutrophication which is increasing due to human stressors and global change. Most lake carbon budget models do not account for calcification because the conditions necessary for its occurrence are not well constrained. This study aims at identifying ratios between calcification and primary production and the drivers that control these ratios in freshwater. Using in situ incubations in several European freshwater lakes, we identify a strong relationship between calcite saturation and the ratio between calcification and net ecosystem production (NEP) (p-value < 0.001, R-2 = 0.95). NEP-induced calcification is a short-term process that is potentiated by the increase in calcite saturation occurring at longer time scales, usually reaching the highest levels in summer. The resulting summer calcification event has effects on the DIC equilibria, causing deviations from the metabolic 1:1 stoichiometry between DIC and dissolved oxygen (DO). The strong dependency of the ratio between NEP and calcification on calcite saturation can be used to develop a suitable parameterization to account for calcification in lake carbon budgets.

George, Georgia, which resulted in significant and longlasting changes in the fish populations of this reservoir. Prior to the fish kill, populations of both threadfin (Dorosoma petenense) and gizzard shad (D. cepedianum) were dominated by intermediate-and harvestable-size fish. Anglers reported largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) fishing was poor, and age analysis indicated poor recruitment for several years. Following the fish kill, shad populations were dominated by large numbers of fingerlings, and standing crops of intermediate- and harvestable-size shad were much reduced. Large numbers of largemouth bass were recruited to the fishery the year following the fish kill, and recruitment remained good for 8 of the 9 years following the kill. Electrofishing catch of largemouth bass >20 cm total length increased from an average of 26.7 fish/hour for 5 years prior to the fish kill to an average of 63.7 fish/hour from 1987 through 1995. Total harvest of largemouth bass, as estimated by creel surveys, increased 2-4 fold following the kill. Directed catch rates for all sizes of largemouth bass increased from 0.24 fish/hour in 1984 to 0.51 fish/hour in 1987 and remained above 0.40 fish/hour through 1991. By 1989, the 1986, 1987, and 1988 year classes represented 79.9% of the largemouth bass population by number.																									1995							37	46																WOS:A1995BJ69N00006

Eight replicate trees of each selection, grafted onto seedling rootstocks, were planted in a randomized block design. The first two winters at the test planting site were unusually mild for the Finger Lakes region, with the lowest recorded temperatures above -16 degreesC (3.2 degreesF). Despite these mild winters, there was extensive winter mortality of some pawpaw varieties. Survival rates were > 75% for 11 varieties, and were <40% for five other varieties. Poor establishment of grafted clonal pawpaws and insufficient pollination or fertilization of established pawpaws were important limitations of successful commercialization of this new fruit crop under conditions typical of upstate New York. Open mesh black plastic trunk guards provided adequate shade and protection for newly planted pawpaws, whereas translucent plastic tree-tubes caused heat stress and scorching of the young trees.

In 1999, a blizzard associated with an intense cyclone disabled Chicago and much of the U.S. Midwest with 30-90 cm of snow. Such winter weather conditions have many impacts on the lives and property of people throughout much of North America. Each of these events is the culmination of a complex interaction between synoptic-scale, mesoscale, and microscale processes. An understanding of how the multiple size scales and timescales interact is critical to improving forecasting of these severe winter weather events. The Lake-Induced Convection Experiment (Lake-ICE) and the Snowband Dynamics Project (SNOWBAND) collected comprehensive datasets on processes involved in lake-effect snowstorms and snowbands associated with cyclones during the winter of 1997/98. This paper outlines the goals and operations of these collaborative projects. Preliminary findings are given with illustrative examples of new state-of-the-art research observations collected. Analyses associated with Lake-ICE and SNOWBAND hold the promise of greatly improving our scientific understanding of processes involved in these important wintertime phenomena.

Previous work suggested that rainfall was important for carbon gas evasion. During the stratified period, precipitation generated unexpected variabilities in CO2, CH4, and DOC concentrations below the euphotic zone, especially in the metalimnion. The DOC concentrations after the rains rose to 22 and 10 mg L-1 from the initial 13 and 8 mg L-1, in the humic and clear-water lakes respectively, simultaneously with an increase in carbon gas concentrations. In both lakes, the water column was stable, suggesting that the high gas concentrations were not due to transport from hypolimnia rich in carbon gases. The high concentrations of CH4, which can only be produced in anoxic conditions, in the oxic metalimnion and epilimnion in comparison to the hypolimnetic concentrations indicated that a considerable proportion of the pelagic CH4 originated from the catchment and/or the littoral zone. Thus, as a consequence of high levels of precipitation, carbon gas concentrations during summer stratification can increase, which can have overall importance in annual carbon budgets.																			0168-2563	1573-515X				MAY	2013	113	1-3					613	627		10.1007/s10533-012-9792-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-012-9792-2													WOS:000317863300037

For the Yellowstone National Park segment of white birds (sub-adults and adults combined) the estimated probability of a positive growth rate is 0.01. The estimated probability of achieving the Subcommittee on Rocky Mountain Trumpeter Swans 2002 population goal of 40 white birds for the Yellowstone segment is less than 0.01. Outside of Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming white birds are estimated to have a 0.79 probability of a positive growth rate with a 0.05 probability of achieving the 2002 objective of 120 white birds. In the Centennial Valley in southwest Montana, results indicate a probability of 0.87 that the white bird population is growing at a positive rate with considerable uncertainty. The estimated probability of achieving the 2002 Centennial Valley objective of 160 white birds is 0.14 but under an alternative model falls to 0.04. The estimated probability that the Targhee National Forest segment of white birds has a positive growth rate is 0.03. In Idaho outside of the Targhee National Forest, white birds are estimated to have a 0.97 probability of a positive growth rate with a 0.18 probability of attaining the 2002 goal of 150 white birds.																			1524-4695						2002	25			1			319	326																WOS:000180160100043

However, few quantitative studies have evaluated the effects of ship noise on wintering waterbirds in lakes. In this study, the effects of ship noise simulated by noise playback at different intensities and interference distances on the behaviors of the bean goose, a wintering waterbird species, were evaluated. Sensitivity to noise was higher in small populations than in large populations. Noises of >70 dB at distances of 80 dB at Wild animals are vulnerable to environmental noise. In wetlands, wintering waterbirds are easily disturbed by ship noises; however, the behavioral changes of waterbirds in response to different levels of noise are unclear. We simulated the acoustic environment created by ship movement to investigate the effects of ship noise on foraging, vigilance, and flight behaviors of the wintering bean goose (Anser fabalis). In particular, we used a noise playback method to simulate the acoustic environment created by ship operations at various noise levels (i.e., background noise <50 dB, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 dB), distances from the noise (i.e., short <100 m, medium 100-200 m, and long distances 200-300 m), and noise duration (i.e., short 0-1 min, medium 2-3 min, and long 4-5 min). Results indicated that the noise intensity and interference distance had obvious influence on the bean geese behavior, but the noise duration had no effect. Smaller populations (N <= 30) were more sensitive to noise interference. As the noise level increased, the frequency of foraging behavior decreased and the frequencies of vigilance and flight behaviors increased, particularly above 70 dB. For noises >70 dB at short disturbance distances and >80 dB at medium disturbance distances, flight behavior increased significantly. These findings suggested that ships should keep a distance of more than 200 m from waterbirds to reduce noise interference.					; Zhou, Lizhi/AAF-4535-2021	Wang, Sujuan/0000-0002-6929-1948; Jiang, Bo/0000-0002-4556-469X													2076-2615					FEB	2022	12	4							465	10.3390/ani12040465	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani12040465								35203174					WOS:000763735600001

The origin and distribution of boron brine deposits on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is an important foundation for B resource formation, evolution, and enrichment, which have long been the subject of debate. The boron isotope system is a sensitive geochemical tracer, making it useful for effectively and precisely tracking a wide range of geological processes and sources. This study investigates the major cations, [B], and delta B-11 values of samples (lake brine, river waters, and cold spring water) from the Bangor Co Lake which is a typical salt lake rich in boron in Tibet, China. There are magnitude-scale differences in [B] among different sample types: river samples < cold spring water < < brine lakes. [B] values vary from 0.73 to similar to 1113 mg/L. Similar to [B], the delta B-11 values of the samples exhibit magnitude-scale variations as [B], ranging from - 7.35 parts per thousand to + 7.66 parts per thousand. There are also magnitude-scale differences in delta B-11 among different sample types. The delta B-11 values of cold spring water are relatively low, and the values range from - 1.26 parts per thousand to -7.75 parts per thousand. However, the river water samples and saline lakes have higher values, from 0.38 parts per thousand to 4.62 parts per thousand, and the delta B-11 values of river water samples are basically in the distribution range of those of Bangor Co Lake. This indicates that the sources of boron in Bangor Co Lake are mainly the recharge water with higher delta B-11 values and spring water with lower delta B-11 values, and the boron sources and the uneven mixing of lake water are two reasons that account for the large change in the delta B-11 value of Bangor Co Lake.					he, maoyong/ADO-7723-2022														2096-0956	2365-7499				OCT	2022	41	5					731	740		10.1007/s11631-022-00542-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11631-022-00542-1		AUG 2022											WOS:000835595400001

Simulation of melt pond evolution on level ice	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												A melt pond model is presented that predicts pond size and depth changes, given an initial ice thickness field and representative surface fluxes. The model is based on the assumption that as sea ice melts, fresh water builds up in the ice pore space and eventually saturates the ice. Under these conditions, a water table is defined equal to the draft of the ice or sea level, and ponds are produced in ice surface depressions, much like lakes in a watershed. Pond evolution is forced by applying fluxes of heat at the pond surface and a radiative transfer model for solar radiation that penetrates the pond. Results from the model using forcing data from the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) experiment and representative pond parameters indicate that the model accurately simulates pond depth and fractional area over the summer melt season, with fractional area increasing linearly. Overall, ice albedo is affected primarily by the increase in pond coverage. Decrease in pond albedo from pond deepening has a much lower influence on the total albedo. Cases with predominately sunny conditions are shown to produce more rapid pond expansion than overcast cases. In both sunny and cloudy cases the fractional area increases linearly.																			2169-9275	2169-9291				DEC 18	2009	114								C12019	10.1029/2009JC005363	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2009JC005363													WOS:000272945100001

Extended Water-Level Drawdowns in Dammed Rivers Enhance Fish Habitat: Environmental Pool Management in the Upper Mississippi River	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Environmental Pool Management (EPM) can improve ecosystem function in rivers by restoring aspects of the natural flow regime lost to dam construction. EPM recreates summer baseflow conditions and promotes the growth of terrestrial vegetation which is inundated in the fall, thereby improving habitat heterogeneity for many aquatic taxa. A three-year experiment was conducted wherein terrestrial floodplain areas were dewatered through EPM water-level reductions and the resulting terrestrial vegetation was (1) allowed to remain or (2) removed in paired plots in Mississippi River pool 25. Fish assemblage and abundance were quantified in paired plots after inundation. Abundances of many fish species were greater in vegetated plots, especially for species that utilize vegetation during portions of their life history. Fish assemblages varied more between plot types when the magnitude of EPM water-level drawdowns was greater, which produced greater vegetation growth. Young-of-year individuals, especially from small, early maturing species and/or species reliant on vegetation for refuge, feeding, or life history, utilized vegetated plots more than devegetated plots. Vegetation growth produced under EPM was heavily used by river fishes, including young-of-year individuals, which may ultimately positively influence recruitment. Increased habitat heterogeneity may mitigate some of the negative impacts of dam construction and water-level regulation on river fishes. Annual variability in vegetation responses that occurs under EPM enhances natural environmental variability which could ultimately contribute to increased fish diversity. Low-cost programs like EPM can be implemented as a part of adaptive management plans to help maintain biodiversity and ecosystem health in anthropogenically altered rivers.

J	Correa, SB				Correa, Sandra Bibiana			Fish assemblage structure is consistent through an annual hydrological cycle in habitats of a floodplain-lake in the Colombian Amazon	NEOTROPICAL ICHTHYOLOGY												I investigated changes in abundance and spatial distribution of medium- and large-sized fishes (> 100 mm) in an oxbow lake of the lower Apaporis River, Colombian Amazon, across three seasons (falling, low, and rising water). Fifty-three species in 13 families were collected from six habitats: lagoon channels, stream, flooded forests, isolated shrub patches, muddy beaches, and rocks. Abundance, biomass, and species richness were higher during the rising-water season and lower during falling-water season. Correspondence analysis (CA) showed that fish assemblages were associated to two basic habitat types. One assemblage of fishes was associated with densely vegetated and structurally complex habitats (flooded forest, lagoon channels, stream, and isolated shrub patches), and a second assemblage of fishes was associated with muddy beaches. These assemblages persisted despite seasonal fluctuations in water level. Species in the structurally complex habitats assemblage were mostly omnivores, whereas the beach habitat assemblage included mainly piscivores and detritivores. Results from this study suggest that overall abundance of fishes in habitats within and surrounding Taraira Lake is highly variable among seasons, but species habitat affinity is maintained through seasons.

It is a landlocked body of water lying at sea level (length 21.72 km; maximum width 1.55 km; maximum depth 100.0 m) which is occasionally opened to the sea. The landlocked condition is caused by prevailing southwest winds and wave action which create a beach barrier that effectively isolates the mouth from St. Mary''s Bay. Under landlocked conditions, there was a continual decrease in salinity and dissolved O2 at all depths. Temperature profiles were of a dichothermic nature; a certain amount of temporal variability was noted in lower lying water. When the barrier was opened (by bulldozer) and the pond came under tidal influence, there was a replenishment of salt water and dissolved O2. Temperature profiles retained the same overall shape but were more erratic and compared with the closed barrier condition, showed greater variability with time especially in the deeper water. A small amount of commercial fishing is carried out in the pond during both open and closed barrier conditions. A total of 30 spp. of fish was encountered during the sampling period. Salvelinus fontinalis, Gadus morhua, Urophycis tenuis, Pseudopleuronectes americanus and Alosa pseudoharengus were studied in detail. Aspects of their biology are compared with other populations and discussed in the context of environmental conditions peculiar to Holyrood Pond.																			0020-9309						1984	69	3					333	360		10.1002/iroh.19840690303	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19840690303													WOS:A1984TA02800002
J	Mackay, JR; Burn, CR				Mackay, JR; Burn, CR			The first 20 years (1978-1979 to 1998-1999) of active-layer development, Illisarvik experimental drained lake site, western Arctic coast, Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Active-layer thickness, snow depth, minimum soil temperatures, near-surface ground ice, soil heave, and permafrost temperatures have been measured for over 20 years following the 1978 artificial drainage of Lake Illisarvik. Measurements of active-layer thickness and other variables have been made at 25-m intervals along the major and minor axes of the oval-shaped drained-lake bed. Permafrost aggradation commenced in the lake bottom during the first winter following drainage. Before the establishment of vegetation, there was little snow cover, minimum ground temperatures were low, and the active layer was relatively thin. However, both snow depth and minimum ground temperatures have risen where vegetation has grown, the active layer has thickened, and in response, the temperature in permafrost has gradually increased. In the lake bottom, the change in snow depth associated with vegetation growth has been the dominant control on variation in active-layer thickness and not summer weather conditions, which are well correlated with thaw depths along an active-layer course established in the adjacent tundra. Changes in elevation of the surface of the lake bed have been measured with respect to some 40 bench marks anchored in permafrost, and indicate vertical movements of the surface associated with frost heave, thaw subsidence, and the growth of aggradational ice. The ground ice content of near-surface permafrost determined by drilling is in close agreement with the measured uplift of the lake bed. The rate of growth of aggradational ice has been similar to0.5 cm a(-1) over 20 years.																			0008-4077					NOV	2002	39	11					1657	1674		10.1139/E02-068	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/E02-068													WOS:000180050600006

The emergence and dominance of Planktothrix rubescens as an hypolimnetic cyanobacterium in response to re-oligotrophication of a deep peri-alpine lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Toxic cyanobacteria, such as Planktothrix rubescens, came to dominate temperate lakes in the mid-to-late 20(th) century, as a result of eutrophication. Even after decades of re-oligotrophication, where phosphorus levels were reduced by 1-2 orders of magnitude, P. rubescens remains present in various lakes. In this study, we examine the persistence and changes of P. rubescens deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) in Lake Hallwil (Switzerland) over 35 yr of steadily decreasing phosphorous concentrations. Although lake transparency increased and the euphotic layer deepened during this period, the P. rubescens population maximum moved even deeper. It is now found ca. 7.7 m deeper than its shallowest position in the 2000s, and this depth no longer coincides with the depth of maximal water column stability. P. rubescens neutral buoyancy has now driven it beneath the stable metalimnion into the hypolimnion, where buoyancy regulation is restricted due to reduced metabolic activity at low light and low temperature. If P. rubescens DCM continues to deepen each year, it will eventually reach a region of lower stability in the hypolimnion where turbulent conditions are strong enough to disperse the DCM. We also explore the mechanisms that ensure P. rubescens ongoing presence in peri-alpine lakes despite strong re-oligotrophication and ongoing climate change. We find that P. rubescens in the lake is mainly sustained by growth during fully mixed conditions in winter, not during stratification in summer. This may contradict another commonly made prediction that periods of longer stratification will promote future blooms of this cyanobacterium.

Extreme rates of channel incision and shape evolution in response to a continuous, rapid base-level fall, the Dead Sea, Israel	GEOMORPHOLOGY												In nature, opportunities are limited for recording the response to a rapid ongoing base-level fall and for examining its effects on channel evolution during the process. Following a dramatic base-level fall, the natural laboratory area of the Dead Sea offers such an opportunity. Classical shape evolution models of incised channels describe the response to an "impulse" type base-level drop after it became stabilized. The Dead Sea delineates during its continuous level drop a different mode of adjustment from those previously conceptualized. We have recorded the entrenchment rates of channels and their transient shape evolution "at a station" in real time, i.e., during the ongoing base-level fall. This study represents the first attempt to apply integrated time series of high resolution DEMs, change detection maps, Differential Global Position System measurements, and field methods to monitor vertical and horizontal entrenchment rates, as well as the evolution of the cross-sectional shape of channels in response to a continuous and rapidly lowering base level. Mean vertical entrenchment rates are very high, 0.4-0.8 m/y, and widening rates are even higher (2.1-24 m/y). Elevation-change detection maps demonstrate along banks a patchy pattern of channel entrenchment, indicating the initial widening stage. The incised channels have a trapezoidal, gorge-like, cross-sectional form, i.e., they have developed beyond the initial stage of net vertical incision. However, neither advanced channel widening nor development of an inner floodplain has been observed. We conclude that widening is yet ineffective in damping the vertical adjustment. The continuous and rapid lowering of the Dead Sea level entraps the drainage systems in the vertical incision mode, preventing the evolutionary progression toward a wide, graded, and stable geometry which has been conceptualized in existing models.

Increasing Iodine Concentrations during Landlocked Fall Chinook Salmon Egg Disinfection Decrease Bacterial Numbers with No Impact on Egg Survival	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUACULTURE												Egg disinfection is an important practice that prevents potential disease transfer, but currently allowable disinfection regimes do not completely eliminate external egg membrane microbes. In this experiment, newly fertilized and water-hardened landlocked fall Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha eggs were submersed for 10min in povidone-iodine solutions containing 0, 100, 200, and 400mg/L active iodine. External egg bacterial numbers (CFUs) were quantified after each disinfection treatment, and egg survival (%) was calculated at the eyed stage. All of the disinfection treatments significantly reduced CFUs compared with untreated controls. However, eggs from the 400-mg/L iodine treatment had significantly lower CFUs (2.20 +/- 0.59 [mean +/- SE]) than the 100-mg/L (10.43 +/- 8.01) and 200-mg/L (8.10 +/- 1.51) treatments. Percent survival was not significantly different among any of the treatments; survival was 18.86 +/- 5.17%, 19.17 +/- 4.76%, and 20.16 +/- 5.27% in the eggs subjected to 100mg/L, 200mg/L, and 400mg/L iodine, respectively. These results indicate that 10-min treatments of 400mg/L active iodine on landlocked fall Chinook Salmon eggs provide the most microbial reduction with no effect on subsequent egg survival.																			1522-2055	1548-8454				OCT	2018	80	4					363	368		10.1002/naaq.10042	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/naaq.10042													WOS:000448082900003

The palaeovegetational reconstruction dates back to the mid-Atlantic (6500-6700 cal. BP). The plant macrofossil record revealed that groups of Pinus mugo and Juniperus sibirica were distributed in the subalpine zone. The treeline was shaped by Pinus sylvestris and Pinus peuce and was higher (up to 2200-2300 in a.s.l.) compared with the present-day. A change to cooler summers and warmer winters after 6700 cal. BP, characterized by a rise in humidity and precipitation, stimulated the formation of a coniferous vegetation belt dominated by Pinus sylvestris, Pinus peuce and Abies alba. The pollen assemblages also indicated a dominance of deciduous trees (Quercetum mixtum-Corylus phase) at low altitudes until c. 6000 cal. BP. The sub-Boreal was characterized by a wider distribution of Abies alba in the lower part of the coniferous belt and a gradual enlargement of the areas occupied by Fagus sylvatica and Picea abies after 3800-3500 cal. BP. The macrofossil finds of Picea abies testify to its expansion after 2800 cal. BP when average temperatures dropped and precipitation increased. Traces of human disturbance in the subalpine area are continuously registered in the pollen and plant macrofossil records since 3770 cal.

In order to evaluate the survival and potential significance of these akinetes as an inoculum for next years pelagic population, their capacity to survive a winter on dry ground was tested and the akinete-containing colonies in the sediments of a shallow bay were quantified. The concentration of akinetes was higher in these shallow areas than in the deeper parts of the lake, but the incomparably highest numbers per m(2) were found more or less on the shoreline. The experiments showed that the akinetes were still able to germinate after six winter months on land. My studies indicate that the main part of the recruitment of new G. echinulata colonies could come from the littoral areas. Potentially this could also be true for other species, suggesting that it is important to include the littoral zone in further studies on seasonal migration.																			0071-1128		3-510-47053-2				1998	51						21	27																WOS:000078414300002

What motivates farmers to apply phosphorus at the "right" time? Survey evidence from the Western Lake Erie Basin	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Phosphorus loadings from the Maumee River watershed have significantly compromised the Lake Erie ecosystem, as evidenced by the most severe harmful algal bloom in Lake Erie in 2015 and the shut-down of Toledo drinking water supply in 2014. Despite government payments for adoption of voluntary conservation practices, excess nutrient runoff from agricultural production remains a substantial challenge. The right timing of nutrient application is a critical best management practice (BMP). Using a unique survey of 2540 farmer respondents in the Maumee River watershed, this paper analyzes how socio-psychological, socio-demographic, and field based spatial characteristics impact farmers' adoption of timing-related best practices for nutrient management, including delaying broadcast application before a storm event, avoiding winter application of nutrients, and avoiding fall application of nutrients. Results reveal three unique classes of farmers for each of the timing related management decisions. While the significance of most farmer and field characteristics varies across the three BMP adoption decisions, perceived efficacy-the belief that the particular practice will actually reduce dissolved phosphorus runoff from farm fields-is positively correlated with a higher likelihood of adopting each of the BMPs across almost all classes of farmers. For example, results from the ordered logit model suggest that a 20% increase in perceived efficacy would result in the likelihood of actual adoption of delaying broadcast from 35% to 48%. An implication is that policies and outreach efforts aimed at increasing farmers' perceived efficacy of practices could lead to higher adoption levels, but the effectiveness may vary across different classes of farmers.

The existence of a high livestock population and animal grazing activities in meadow and pasturelands of the watershed during the short summer period poses serious stress on both surface and groundwater resources being the only drinking water supply for the local communities. Therefore, understanding the effect of grazing and livestock breeding activities occurring in the recharge areas of the fractured volcanic rock aquifer is vital to take precautions in order to protect limited water supplies at the watershed and vulnerable lake ecosystem as well. The mean nitrate content of the groundwater was measured at 6.4 +/- 6.6 (std. dev) mg/L in the wet (before grazing) period and 7.1 +/- 5.9 mg/L in the dry (after grazing) period. Despite low nitrate concentration levels of groundwater, microbial contamination was observed in the spring waters at alarming levels especially after the animal grazing activities. 56%, 26%, and 11% of the groundwater samples showed bacterial contamination in terms of total coliform, fecal coliform, and fecal streptococci contents, respectively, prior to grazing activity, while in pursuit of intense livestock grazing at highland, these microbial indicators have been increased to 92%, 85%, and 77% in the dry period. A significant increase observed in fecal contamination indicates the negative impact of livestock activities on groundwater quality. Al (200-638 mu g/L) and Fe (66-218 mu g/L) enrichments locally observed in groundwater were related to advanced argillic alteration (kaolinization) and hematization zones in pyroclastic rocks.

Previous models have explained the low-latitude dryness as a result of atmospheric methane transport into middle and high latitudes(16). Hitherto, no model has explained why lakes are found only in polar regions and preferentially in the north; how low-latitude rainstorms arise; or why clouds cluster in southern middle and high latitudes. Here we report simulations with a three-dimensional atmospheric model coupled to a dynamic surface reservoir of methane. We find that methane is cold-trapped and accumulates in polar regions, preferentially in the north because the northern summer, at aphelion, is longer and has greater net precipitation than the southern summer. The net precipitation in polar regions is balanced in the annual mean by slow along-surface methane transport towards mid-latitudes, and subsequent evaporation. In low latitudes, rare but intense storms occur around the equinoxes, producing enough precipitation to carve surface features. Tropospheric clouds form primarily in middle and high latitudes of the summer hemisphere, which until recently has been the southern hemisphere. We predict that in the northern polar region, prominent clouds will form within about two (Earth) years and lake levels will rise over the next fifteen years.

In recent years, significant rainfall runoff events have become more frequent and intense in the region. Here, we examine the influence of landscape characteristics on hydrology and nutrient export in nine tributary watersheds of the Assiniboine River in Manitoba, Canada, during snowmelt runoff and with an early summer extreme rainfall runoff event (ERRE). All watersheds included in the study have land use that is primarily agricultural, but with differing proportions of land remaining as wetlands, grassland, and that has been artificially drained. Those watersheds with greater capacity for storage of water in surface depressions (noneffective contributing areas) exhibited lower rates of runoff and nutrient export with snowmelt. During the ERRE, higher export of total P (TP), but not total N, was observed from those watersheds with larger amounts of contributing area that had been added through artificial surface drainage, and this was associated primarily with higher TP concentrations. Increasing or restoring the storage of water on the landscape is likely to reduce nutrient export; however, the importance of antecedent conditions was evident during the ERRE, when small surface depressions were at or near capacity from snowmelt. Total P concentrations observed during the summer ERRE were as high as those observed with snowmelt, and N/P ratios were significantly lower. If the frequency of summer ERREs increases with climate change, this is likely to result in negative water quality outcomes.					; Badiou, Pascal/H-3841-2019; Casson, Nora/P-1915-2018	Badiou, Pascal/0000-0001-9753-943X; 													0047-2425	1537-2537				JUL-AUG	2019	48	4					841	849		10.2134/jeq2018.07.0278	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2018.07.0278								31589679					WOS:000474880000008

Trends in Quality Controlled Precipitation Indicators in the United States Midwest and Great Lakes Region	FRONTIERS IN WATER												Changes in precipitation can have broad and significant societal impacts. A number of previous studies that analyzed changes in precipitation across the Great Lakes and Midwest for a variety of time periods and using a range of quality-control standards and methods observed increased precipitation rates and totals, although there was considerable site-to-site variability, even for sites in close physical proximity. Biases and discontinuities in precipitation observations may contribute to this variability. This study identifies and examines changes in precipitation utilizing a unique approach to observation series screening over a region encompassing the Great Lakes and broader Midwestern region of the United States for the period 1951-2019. A multiple tier procedure was utilized to identify high quality input data series from the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily dataset. Annual and seasonal time series of precipitation indicators were calculated and subjected to breakpoint analysis as further quality control. Trends were analyzed across a broad range of related indicators, from totals and frequencies of threshold events to event duration and potential linkages with total precipitable water. Results indicate that annual precipitation has generally increased across the region in terms of totals, although there is substantial variation across the study domain in the significance and magnitude of annual trends by indicator. Annual trends were spatially most consistent across eastern areas of the study domain while relatively greater station-to-station variability in trend significance and magnitude was observed across northern and western portions. Significant trends were generally fewer in number for seasonal precipitation indicators and less spatially coherent. The greatest number of significant trends occurred in fall with the fewest in spring. Correlation of indicator trends with trends of mean total precipitable water suggests weak correlations annually and moderate correlations at the seasonal scale. The trends of the precipitation indicators in our study exhibited more coherent spatial patterns when compared with studies with different quality control criteria, illustrating the importance of quality control of observations in climatic studies and highlighting the complexity of the changing character of precipitation.

J	OVERMANN, J; BEATTY, JT; HALL, KJ				OVERMANN, J; BEATTY, JT; HALL, KJ			PHOTOSYNTHETIC ACTIVITY AND POPULATION-DYNAMICS OF AMOEBOBACTER-PURPUREUS IN A MEROMICTIC SALINE LAKE	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												A dense population of the purple sulfur bacterium Amoebobacter purpureus in the chemocline of meromictic Mahoney Lake (British Columbia, Canada) underwent consistent changes in biomass over a two year study period. The integrated amount of bacteriochlorophyll reached maxima in August and declined markedly during early fall. Bacteriochlorophyll was only weakly correlated with the light intensity and water temperature in the chemocline. In the summer, bacterial photosynthesis was limited by sulfide availability. During this period the intracellular sulfur concentration of A. purpureus cells decreased. A minimum concentration was measured at the top of the bacterial layer in August, when specific photosynthetic rates of A, purpureus indicated that only 14% of the cells were photosynthetically active. With the exception of a time period between August and September, the specific growth rates calculated from CO2 fixation rates of A. purpureus were similar to growth rates calculated from actual biomass changes in the bacterial layer. Between August and September 86% of the A. purpureus biomass disappeared from the chemocline and were deposited on the littoral sediment of Mahoney Lake or degraded within the mixolimnion. This rise of cells to the lake surface was not mediated by an increase in the specific gas vesicle content which remained constant between April and November. The upwelling phenomenon was related to the low sulfur content of A. purpureus cells and a low resistance of surface water layers against vertical mixing by wind.

J	Harding, LE; Mesler, J				Harding, Larisa E.; Mesler, Jacob, I			Cormorant abundance, diet, and foraging habits in Arizona	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												In Arizona, USA, Double-crested Cormorants (Nannopterum auritum) primarily overwinter, whereas Neotropic Cormorants (N. brasilianum) are common residents year round. Concern exists that both species are increasing in numbers and may have a negative impact on fish populations. We collected data during January 2017-April 2019 to characterize cormorant numbers seasonally, describe their foraging patterns, and evaluate environmental factors associated with cormorant numbers at community fishing waters. With more than 100 trained volunteers, we surveyed water bodies across the state simultaneously once each quarter of the year during January 2017-March 2018. We also visited 36 community fishing waters and other locations to document cormorant foraging activities and to explore potential associations between environmental factors and the maximum number of cormorants counted at each site. We collected stomach contents from lethally sampled cormorants to examine size and species of consumed fish. Our seasonal counts showed the greatest cormorant numbers during the winter and spring, with larger concentrations in metropolitan areas and fewer birds at higher elevations. At community fishing waters, cormorants fed primarily on fish =12 cm long, though they did consume larger sport fish in reservoirs and along the Colorado River. At community fishing waters, cormorant numbers were positively associated with the number of artificial structures in/near the water's edge and with the number of large trees within 200 meters of the water. To reduce cormorant numbers and their anticipated impacts, we recommend stocking larger, stout-bodied fish and removing woody vegetation close to shorelines while adding fully submerged structures to provide security cover for fish from cormorants. This study is unique and important in that it addresses cormorant populations located in the southwestern USA, an area that has not historically been viewed as waterbird habitat, and it presents an unbiased evaluation of cormorant foraging activities in desert areas manipulated by water. It also offers reasonable, non-lethal actions to reducing potential cormorant impacts on aquatic resources.

AGE RATIOS, SEX RATIOS, AND A POPULATION ESTIMATE OF YELLOW RAILS AT SAN BERNARD NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE, TEXAS	SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST												Yellow rails (Coturnicops noveboracensis) winter along the U.S. coast, from North Carolina to Texas and southeastern Oklahoma. Although this rail is listed as a species of special concern in most of the provinces and states where it breeds, little is known about the winter ecology or population sizes of this secretive species. The goals of our study were to approximate numbers and determine age and sex ratios of yellow rails wintering in selected marshes at San Bernard National Wildlife Refuge (San Bernard NWR) in Brazoria and Matagorda counties, Texas. Yellow rails were banded in Spartina marshes from November 2009-April 2010. Feather samples were collected from each yellow rail for use in DNA sexing. We captured 170 yellow rails at the Cedar Lake Creek Unit of San Bernard NWR and recaptured 17 rails over the course of the study. We estimated that the population in marshes we sampled at San Bernard NWR (224.6 ha) from late November through mid-April consisted of 1,170 +/- 300 individuals, or 5.2 +/- 1.3 rails/ha. The highest ranked POPAN models suggest that the probability of recapture and the probability of entering the population were both time-dependent, while the probability of survival was time-independent. All yellow rails captured prior to January (n = 17) could be aged, with six (35.2%) aged as HY (Hatch Year), while 11 (64.7%) were aged as AHY (After Hatch Year). However, we were unable to conclusively assign ages to rails captured in January through April. Sufficient DNA was obtained from 59 yellow rails to determine that 33 (55.9%) were male. While the winter range of this species is widespread, it is likely that the coastal prairies of Texas are particularly important for this species given the large numbers and high density of rails encountered during this study.

Regardless of Chlorella density there was a steep fall in the survivorship of B. havanaensis at 25 degrees C. Both food level and temperature affected the fecundity of B. havanaensis. At any given food level, rotifers cultured at 15 degrees C showed extended but low offspring production. At 25 degrees C, offspring production was elevated, the duration of egg laying reduced and the fecundity was higher during the latter part of the reproductive period. The effect of food level was generally additive, at any given temperature, and higher densities of Chlorella resulted in higher offspring production. Average lifespan, life expectancy at birth and generation time were 2-3 times longer at 15 degrees C than at 25 degrees C. At 20 degrees C, these remained at intermediate levels. The shortest generation time (about 4 days) was observed at 25 degrees C. Gross and net reproductive rates and the rate of population increase (r) increased with increasing temperature and generally, at any given temperature, higher algal food levels contributed to higher values in these variables. The r varied from 0. 11 to 0.66. The survival patterns and lower rates of reproduction at 15 degrees C suggest that the winter temperatures (10-15 degrees C) prevailing in many waterbodies in Mexico City allow this species to sustain throughout the year under natural conditions.

Scaling their carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) exchange with the atmosphere remains challenging due to an incomplete understanding and characterization of spatial and temporal variability in CO2 and CH4. Here, we measured partial pressures of CO2 (pCO(2)) and CH4 (pCH(4)) across 30 ponds and shallow lakes during summer in temperate regions of Europe and North America. We sampled each waterbody in three locations at three times during the growing season, and tested which physical, chemical, and biological characteristics related to the means and variability of pCO(2) and pCH(4) in space and time. Summer means of pCO(2) and pCH(4) were inversely related to waterbody size and positively related to floating vegetative cover; pCO(2) was also positively related to dissolved phosphorus. Temporal variability in partial pressure in both gases weas greater than spatial variability. Although sampling on a single date was likely to misestimate mean seasonal pCO(2) by up to 26%, mean seasonal pCH(4) could be misestimated by up to 64.5%. Shallower systems displayed the most temporal variability in pCH(4) and waterbodies with more vegetation cover had lower temporal variability. Inland waters remain one of the most uncertain components of the global carbon budget; understanding spatial and temporal variability will ultimately help us to constrain our estimates and inform research priorities.

J	TAPPER, NJ				TAPPER, NJ			EVIDENCE FOR A MESOSCALE THERMAL CIRCULATION OVER DRY SALT LAKES	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY					CONF ON SALT LAKES, EVAPORITES AND AEOLIAN DEPOSITS	AUG 08-16, 1988	ARKAROOLA, AUSTRALIA	SALT LAKES EVAPORITES & AEOLIAN DEPOSITS PROGRAM				Because of albedo and thermal conductivity effects, dry salt lakes in central Australia exhibit a characteristic thermal "signature" within the overall landscape, having much cooler daytime surface temperatures and warmer nocturnal temperatures than the surrounding environment. Various aspects of a possible mesoscale thermal circulation arising from such a thermal differentiation have been investigated for The Salt Lake, a moderately sized (70 km2) dry salt lake in northwestern New South Wales (30-degrees-05'S, 142-degrees-08'E). Surface temperatures across The Salt Lake and surrounding landscape determined by field and polar orbiting (NOAA-9) satellite observations show marked variation, with the salt crust remaining up to 16 K cooler than the surrounding sand country during the day and up to 8 K warmer at night. That this thermal forcing can provide a horizontal pressure gradient sufficiently strong to induce air motion is confirmed by analysis of hourly output from a network of anemographs which were established around the perimeter of The Salt Lake during a five-month autumn and winter period. An extremely regular pattern of nocturnal near-surface convergence (lake warm) and daytime divergence (lake cool) is shown, a pattern which is enhanced when data are stratified for anticyclonic conditions with a weak pressure gradient (approximately 24% of total observations). Wind roses produced for a number of sites around the lake show a distinct diurnal reversal in near-surface airflow, with generally onshore flow by day and offshore flow at night. Confirmation that a diurnally reversing thermal circulation does operate under certain conditions at The Salt Lake is provided by pilot balloon analysis of winds aloft and by preliminary mesoscale modelling of airflow. This circulation, which has not previously been described in the literature, may have important environmental and climatic implications in the Australian context.																			0031-0182					MAY	1991	84	1-4					259	269		10.1016/0031-0182(91)90047-U	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(91)90047-U													WOS:A1991FU23800016
J	Bai, ZG; Wan, GJ; Huang, RG; Liu, TS				Bai, ZG; Wan, GJ; Huang, RG; Liu, TS			A comparison on the accumulation characteristics of 7Be and 137Cs in lake sediments and surface soils in western Yunnan and central Guizhou, China	CATENA												The uplifting of the Himalayas has resulted in the development of a three-tiered landform in Southern China, the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau is the middle tier of this landform on the eastern slope of the Himalayas. Lake Hongfeng and Lake Baihua in central Guizhou are about 1000 km away from Lake Erhai in western Yunnan. Sediment cores were collected from Lakes Erhai and Lugu in west Yunnan and Lakes Hongfeng and Baihua in central Guizhou, along with 28 surface soil cores from the watersheds of these lakes. The accumulation characteristics of Be-7 and Cs-137 show that: (1) Cs-137 activities in the soil cores of central Guizhou were higher than that in the western Yunnan. The activities and maximum penetrative depth of (7) Be were similar for the two regions. The activity ratio of Be-7/Cs-137 in surface soil reached 100-1000 in western Yunnan, but only 10-100 for central Guizhou region. (2) Be-7 inventories in soil cores at most sampling sites of central Guizhou were low, reflecting severe soil erosion. Be-7 inventories in the soil cores of Lake Lugu watershed in summer-autumn were higher than that in Lake Hongfeng/Baihua watershed and also higher than that in Lake Erhai watershed. This could be related to high Be-7 precipitation in summer and altitude. (3) 7 Be inventories in sediment cores of Lake Erhai, Lake Lugu and Lake Baihua were 237 +/- 73, 322 +/- 19 and 783 +/- 44 Bq m(-2), respectively. Based on activity values that were corrected to deposition, prior to 1986, Cs-137 inventories in these lakes were 519 +/- 26, 937 +/- 13 and 3704 +/- 56 Bq m(-2), respectively. (4) Modeling indicated that Be-7 and Cs-137 accumulations in Lake Hongfeng and Lake Baihua were dominated by watershed erosion, and controlled by the retention factor in Lake Erhai and Lake Lugu, but the Cs-137 inventory ratios obtained in the sediment core and from direct atmospheric fallout were similar, and the ratios were smaller for 7 Be. (5)7 Be inventories from direct atmospheric fallout in Lake Erhai, Lake Lugu and Lake Baihua were 0.07 +/- 0.02, 0.29 +/- 0.02 and 0.08 +/- 0.01 Bq M-2, respectively. Prior to 1986, Cs-137 inventories were 0. 11 +/- 0.0 1, 0.22 +/- 0.01 and 0.37 +/- 0.01 Bq m(-2), respectively, showing that Cs-137 deposition has a regional difference. This phenomenon may reflect that uplift of the Himalayas has a screening effect on the fallout of globally distributed atmospheric pollutants in western Yunnan, China. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	ANGEL, JR				ANGEL, JR			LARGE-SCALE STORM DAMAGE ON THE US SHORES OF THE GREAT-LAKES	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Storm Data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration provides a data set for examining the spatial and temporal distribution of storm damage caused by large-scale, cyclonic storms on the U.S. shoreline of the Great Lakes for the period 1959-1990. On average, damage reports are much more frequent during high lake levels. Seasonally, the number reaches a maximum in November, declines during the winter months, and reaches a secondary maximum in April. This decrease in the winter months may be due to the protective ice cover on the lakes. Although Michigan received the most damage reports, Illinois, New York, and Ohio have a higher density of reports. Lake Erie and Lake Michigan are most frequently mentioned in the reports. A comparison of dollar losses shows that 1984 and 1985 were by far the costliest years since 1959. Comparison with a similar high-water period in the mid-1970s suggests that shorelines were much more vulnerable to storm damage in the mid-1980s when water levels were higher.

J	Edwards, GR Jr; Neumann, RM; Jacobs, RP; O'Donnell, EB				Edwards, GR Jr; Neumann, RM; Jacobs, RP; O'Donnell, EB			Impacts of small club tournaments on black bass populations in Connecticut and the effects of regulation exemptions	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Annual tournament-associated mortality of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and smallmouth bass M. dolomieu (greater than or equal to 30 cm) was quantified at Mansfield Hollow Reservoir and Gardner Lake, Connecticut, during 2001 and 2002 to determine the effects of tournaments on black bass populations. Nontournament and tournament anglers followed a 30-cm minimum length limit during both years. Tournament anglers-but not nontournament anglers-were exempt from new, more restrictive regulations (a 30-41-cm protected slot length limit at Mansfield Hollow Reservoir; a 41-cm minimum length limit at Gardner Lake) imposed in 2002. Annual tournament-associated mortality of largemouth bass was 2.4-8.4% of total annual mortality, 1.0-3.2% of the population size, and 2.0-20.8% of annual fishing mortality. For smallmouth bass, tournament-associated mortality was approximately 7% of total annual mortality, 4% of the population size, and 29-52% of annual fishing mortality. Based on the levels of total annual mortality, annual fishing mortality, and annual tournament-associated mortality, impacts of tournament angling appeared low in these two lakes. Tournament-associated impacts would have been lower if anglers were prohibited from exemptions. If exemptions were prohibited year-round or only during the summer, 80-94% of the tournament catch would have been immediately released. Relative to fishing effort, tournament anglers in Connecticut contributed a greater proportion of annual fishing mortality than nontournament anglers. In lakes where tournament-associated mortality is high, prohibiting exemptions (especially during summer) may help to reduce tournament-associated mortality. In lakes with low tournament impacts, allowing exemptions (except during summer) may protect tournament angling opportunities for most of the fishing season, while at the same time decreasing tournament-associated mortality during the warmest months.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG	2004	24	3					811	821		10.1577/M03-150.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M03-150.1													WOS:000223531200007

Microbial methane oxidation efficiency and robustness during lake overturn	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS												Many seasonally stratified lakes accumulate substantial amounts of the greenhouse gas methane in the anoxic zone. Methane oxidizing bacteria in the water column act as a converter, oxidizing methane into carbon dioxide and biomass before it reaches the atmosphere. Current observations and estimates of this methane oxidation efficiency are diverging, especially for the lake overturn period. Here, we combine a model of turbulent mixing, gas exchange, and microbial growth with a comprehensive data set for autumn mixing to quantify the relevant physical and microbial processes for a 16 m deep, wind-sheltered Swiss lake. Scenario analysis suggests that the methane converter is efficient and robust under a large range of mixing velocities and only rare events of pronounced surface cooling can trigger substantial outgassing. This case study combines in situ observation and a deterministic physically based model and suggests that the frequency of storms may strongly impact methane emissions for similar temperate lakes.					; Wehrli, Bernhard/A-4406-2013; Eugster, Werner/E-5116-2010; Wehrli, Bernhard/M-3847-2019; Burgmann, Helmut/E-8804-2011	Bouffard, Damien/0000-0002-2005-9718; Wehrli, Bernhard/0000-0001-7029-1972; Burgmann, Helmut/0000-0002-5651-5906; Mayr, Magdalena/0000-0002-3182-1480; Zimmermann, Matthias/0000-0001-9070-5941; Eugster, Werner/0000-0001-6067-0741														2378-2242				DEC	2021	6	6					320	328		10.1002/lol2.10209	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lol2.10209		OCT 2021											WOS:000703462800001

Projections for the winter include drastically reduced ice and very weak water column stratification. In contrast, the summertime surface warming is projected to begin earlier, last longer, and be more enhanced. In concert, summertime biological production is projected to shift earlier and become larger. These changes have potentially important consequences for stakeholders with interests in shipping, coastal habitability, fishing, water quality, and recreation. Perhaps more fundamentally, the projected changes imply that Lake Superior may change into a different kind of lake with a dramatically weakened dimictic behavior.

The absorption spectra of DOM from this polluted saline lake resembled that of DOM from other natural environments. The spatial distribution of absorption coefficients at 280 nm (a280) indicated that sewage discharge was the main source of CDOM in this lagoon. A notable seasonal variation of a280 was observed from spring of 2008 to spring of 2009, indicating the reduction in sewage discharge from municipal works. Most values of spectral slope ratio (SR) of CDOM absorption were >1, implying that sewage-derived DOM has a low molecular weight. There was a significant linear correlation between a280 and the DOC concentration, demonstrating the feasibility to use optical properties of DOM to assess the degree of organic pollution in highly-polluted aquatic environments.

Studies of hydrological responses to vegetation dynamics are usually conducted on a long-term scale, whereas the hydrological responses within a single year have rarely been studied. In the present study, Poyang Lake runoff (PYL-R) model, a new hydrological model coupled with leaf area index (LAI) remote sensing products, was established and applied to simulate the runoff process in the Poyang Lake Watershed. The simulation results obtained in three sub-watersheds of the Poyang Lake Watershed (Ganjiang Watershed, Xinjiang Watershed, and Fuhe Watershed) agreed well with the observations (Nash efficiency coefficient values and R values exceeded 0.6 and 0.9, respectively). The PYL-R experiment (PYL-R-E) model was designed as a contrast model without considering the impact of LAI. The simulated monthly runoff results obtained using the PYL-R and PYL-R-E models were compared, and the within-year changes in the differences between the two results were analysed to evaluate and quantify the impact of vegetation dynamic on runoff. From January to July, when LAI values increased by around 2.6 m(2) m(-2), monthly runoff depth differences between PYL-R and PYL-R-E results increased by 35.25, 27.98, and 29.14 mm in the Ganjiang, Xinjiang, and Fuhe watersheds, respectively. Dense vegetation caused high interception and evapotranspiration during summer, which largely reduced runoff. By contrast, during winter, the effect of vegetation was weaker on runoff process whereas the impacts of other factors (e.g., precipitation) were higher. The sensitivity of monthly runoff to vegetation dynamics varied greatly throughout the whole year. In particular, during August and September, the LAI-caused runoff changes were very high, accounting for 28-42% of monthly runoff in the sub-watersheds. Our findings clarify the effects of changes in vegetation on hydrological processes over short time scales, thereby providing insights into the effects of scale on eco-hydrological processes.					ji, xm/KYQ-7196-2024; Gu, Yan/IWM-4746-2023; zhao, jing/JAC-6972-2023														0885-6087	1099-1085				JUL 15	2020	34	15					3222	3234		10.1002/hyp.13787	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13787		JUN 2020											WOS:000536638800001

This study examines the changes in the hydrological characteristics of the Attabad landslide-dammed lake over the past decade after the occurrence of the landslide, focusing on lake area dynamics and sediment concentration. High-resolution satellite images from QuickBird, Pleiades, and WorldView2 over seven periods were analyzed. The findings indicate that the lake area has gradually decreased, with the center of mass shifting towards the lake dam, indicating a trend towards stability. The suspended sediment in the barrier lake is distributed in a strip running from north to south, then northeast to southwest, with the sediment concentration decreasing from the lake entrance to the dam and from the lake bank to the center. Over time, the average sediment concentration has decreased from 2010 to 2020, with higher concentrations in summer than in winter. Notably, during the 2017-2020 period, the lower-middle parts of the lake experienced a higher sediment concentration, while the dam area witnessed lower concentrations, thereby reducing the sediment impact on the dam. Furthermore, the sediment content in the middle of the dammed lake is relatively high, which may lead to the formation of a new dammed dam in the middle and the division of the original dammed lake into two smaller lakes, which will affect the stability of the dammed lake.						you san, li/0009-0004-1263-5684														2073-4441				MAR	2024	16	5							714	10.3390/w16050714	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16050714													WOS:001183051300001
J	Channell, JET				Channell, JET			Late Brunhes polarity excursions (Mono Lake, Laschamp, Iceland Basin and Pringle Falls) recorded at ODP Site 919 (Irminger Basin)	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Component natural remanent magnetizations derived from u-channel and 1-cm(3) discrete samples from ODP Site 919 (Irminger Basin) indicate the existence of four intervals of negative inclinations in the upper Brunlies Chronozone. According to the age model based oil planktic oxygen isotope data, these "excursional" intervals occur in sediments deposited during the following time intervals: 32-34 ka, 39-41 ka, 180-188 ka and 205-225 ka. These time intervals correspond to polarity excursions detected elsewhere, known as Mono Lake, Laschamp, Iceland Basin and Pringle Falls. The isotope-based age model is supported by the normalized remanence (paleointensity) record that can be correlated to other calibrated paleointensity records for the 0-500 ka interval, such as that from ODP Site 983. For the intervals associated with the Mono Lake and Laschamp excursions, virtual geomagnetic poles (VGPs) reach equatorial latitudes and mid-southerly latitudes, respectively. For intervals associated with the Iceland Basin and Pringle Falls excursions, repeated excursions of VGPs to high southerly latitudes indicate rapid directional swings rather than a single short-lived polarity reversal. The directional instability associated with polarity excursions is not often recorded, probably due to smoothing of the sedimentary record by the process of detrital remanence (DRM) acquisition.

J	Barker, HW				Barker, H. W.			Isolating the Industrial Contribution of PM2.5 in Hamilton and Burlington, Ontario	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Hourly measurements of particulate matter that is smaller than 2.5 mu m in diameter (PM2.5) have been made at air-monitoring sites in Hamilton and Burlington, Ontario, Canada, since 2003. These sites are separated by similar to 6 km; Burlington is right on Lake Ontario while Hamilton has, directly to the east, very heavy industry between it and Lake Ontario. Hence, by taking the difference between measurements at Hamilton and Burlington, it is possible to isolate, during east-wind conditions, PM2.5 that result from emissions from the industrial sectors (primarily steel mills) located in Hamilton's northeast end. After screening the data for east winds off Lake Ontario, it was found that median background values of PM2.5, of 5-10 mu g m(-3) are increased by an additional 5-10 mu g m(-3) by emissions from local sources. On the contrary, however, industrial contributions to PM2.5 in Burlington during south winds are much smaller at similar to 3 mu g m(-3) (industrial sectors are due south of Burlington). This difference is likely due either to wind direction-dependent local circulation patterns or to alignment of sources that can concentrate PM2.5 into Hamilton. It was also found that throughout much of 2009, but especially during spring and early summer, the industrial contribution of PM2.5 at Hamilton was reduced relative to other years by amounts that are statistically significant at the 95% confidence level, even when measurements are augmented with large amounts of Gaussian noise. These reductions are consistent with documented reductions in steel production during the global economic crisis that peaked in the first half of 2009.																			1558-8424					MAR	2013	52	3					660	667		10.1175/JAMC-D-12-0163.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-12-0163.1													WOS:000316466700011

This study presents high resolution, absolutely-dated records of minerals in bulk samples and elements and stable isotopes of endogenic calcites from a sediment core from Dali Lake in Inner Mongolian Plateau, aiming to investigate the patterns and mechanisms of Holocene hydrological and climatic changes in the modern northern margin of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). Increases in the percentages of allogenic minerals (quartz, microcline and albite) and decreases in the percentages of endogenic/authigenic minerals (calcite, Mg-calcite and gypsum), together with decreases in the values of Ca and Mg concentrations and delta O-18 and delta C-13 of endogenic calcites indicate an excess of water input to the lake over evaporative losses, and vice versa. These data suggest that the hydrological balance of Dali Lake was controlled by strong evaporation before 9800 cal yr BP, and then the lake was supplied by significantly increased inflowing water between 9800 and 5900 cal yr BR. From 5900 to 4850 cal yr BP, the water input to the lake significantly decreased. Since 4850 cal yr BP, the inflowing water maintained a low level. In addition, the distinct characteristics of mineralogy and carbonate geochemistry of the Dali Lake sediments during the periods of high lake level between 9800-7700 and 7700-5900 cal yr BP imply that the lake was mainly fed by snow/ice melt water in the former period and then by regional precipitation in the latter period, which was further supported by the pollen records from the same sediment core. These results suggest that Holocene hydrological variations in the EASM margin were closely related to changes in regional temperature and precipitation which were ultimately controlled by changes in the Northern Hemisphere summer insolation, northern high latitude ice sheets, global sea level and physicochemical conditions of the North Atlantic and western tropical Pacific on orbital and millennial timescales. The datasets in this study support that the maximum EASM intensity occurred during the middle Holocene in the northern EASM regions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Chloroflexi CL500-11 Populations That Predominate Deep-Lake Hypolimnion Bacterioplankton Rely on Nitrogen-Rich Dissolved Organic Matter Metabolism and C1 Compound Oxidation	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The Chloroflexi CL500-11 clade contributes a large proportion of the bacterial biomass in the oxygenated hypolimnia of deep lakes worldwide, including the world's largest freshwater system, the Laurentian Great Lakes. Traits that allow CL500-11 to thrive and its biogeochemical role in these environments are currently unknown. Here, we found that a CL500-11 population was present mostly in offshore waters along a transect in ultraoligotrophic Lake Michigan (a Laurentian Great Lake). It occurred throughout the water column in spring and only in the hypolimnion during summer stratification, contributing up to 18.1% of all cells. Genome reconstruction from metagenomic data suggested an aerobic, motile, heterotrophic lifestyle, with additional energy being gained through carboxidovory and methylovory. Comparisons to other available streamlined freshwater genomes revealed that the CL500-11 genome contained a disproportionate number of cell wall/capsule biosynthesis genes and the most diverse spectrum of genes involved in the uptake of dissolved organic matter (DOM) substrates, particularly peptides. In situ expression patterns indicated the importance of DOM uptake and protein/peptide turnover, as well as type I and type II carbon monoxide dehydrogenase and flagellar motility. Its location in the water column influenced its gene expression patterns the most. We observed increased bacteriorhodopsin gene expression and a response to oxidative stress in surface waters compared to its response in deep waters. While CL500-11 carries multiple adaptations to an oligotrophic lifestyle, its investment in motility, its large cell size, and its distribution in both oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes indicate its ability to thrive under conditions where resources are more plentiful. Our data indicate that CL500-11 plays an important role in nitrogen-rich DOM mineralization in the extensive deep-lake hypolimnion habitat.

J	McKinney, P; Hollenhorst, T; Hoffman, J				McKinney, Paul; Hollenhorst, Tom; Hoffman, Joel			Autonomous underwater glider observations in southern Lake Ontario and Niagara River plume	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The nearshore areas of the Laurentian Great Lakes provide valuable ecosystem services including habitat for a variety of species and water for surrounding communities. Recent declines in nearshore water quality have increased the need for understanding the connectivity between nearshore and offshore areas; however observing water quality variability across the dynamic nearshore to offshore transition zone poses logistical challenges for traditional observing systems. Here we evaluate cross-shore and along-shore water quality gradients using observations from two three-week deployments of a Slocum autonomous glider in southern Lake Ontario. The glider was deployed between the Niagara River mouth and Rochester, NY during early and late summer 2018, and each deployment resulted in over 3000 vertical profiles of the water column and several transects between 2 km and 20 km from shore. In early summer, the cross-shore chlorophyll gradient was characterized by highest values just below the surface, at the frontal zone between weakly stratified conditions closer to shore and unstratified conditions offshore. In late summer, stratified conditions extended across the entire survey area. The depth of the thermocline was deeper and chlorophyll values were lower within 10 km of shore than offshore, where the highest chlorophyll values were observed in a distinct layer below the thermocline. In both early and late summer, the frontal boundary indicated by the cross-shore chlorophyll gradient was located below the surface and well offshore of what is typically considered the nearshore zone but was within the width of the coastal boundary layer. The high-resolution glider observations provide a detailed view of patterns of variability across a dynamic coastal zone and pinpoint the cross-shore frontal boundary that may be important for biologists to differentiate biological communities.																			1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-MAR	2022	25	1			SI		102	113		10.14321/aehm.025.01.102	http://dx.doi.org/10.14321/aehm.025.01.102								38269304					WOS:000811497400021
J	Detwiler, PM; Coe, MF; Dexter, DM				Detwiler, PM; Coe, MF; Dexter, DM			The benthic invertebrates of the Salton Sea: distribution and seasonal dynamics	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The Salton Sea, California's largest inland water body, is an athalassic saline lake with an invertebrate fauna dominated by marine species. The distribution and seasonal dynamics of the benthic macroinvertebrate populations of the Salton Sea were investigated during 1999 in the first survey of the benthos since 1956. Invertebrates were sampled from sediments at depths of 2-12 m, shallow water rocky substrates, and littoral barnacle shell substrates. The macroinvertebrates of the Salton Sea consist of a few invasive, euryhaline species, several of which thrive on different substrates. The principal infaunal organisms are the polychaetes Neanthes succinea Frey & Leuckart and Streblospio benedicti Webster, and the oligochaetes Thalassodrilides gurwitschi Cook, T. belli Hrabe, and an enchytraeid. All but Neanthes are new records for the Sea. Benthic crustacean species are the amphipods Gammarus mucronatus Say, Corophium louisianum Shoemaker, and the barnacle Balanus amphitrite Darwin. Neanthes succinea is the dominant infaunal species on the Sea bottom at depths of 2-12 m. Area-weighted estimates of N. succinea standing stock in September and November 1999 were two orders of magnitude lower than biomass estimated in the same months in 1956. During 1999, population density varied spatially and temporally. Abundance declined greatly in offshore sediments at depths >2 m during spring and summer due to decreasing oxygen levels at the sediment surface, eventually resulting in the absence of Neanthes from all offshore sites >2 m between July and November. In contrast, on shoreline rocky substrate, Neanthes persisted year round, and biomass density increased nearly one order of magnitude between January and November. The rocky shoreline had the highest numbers of invertebrates per unit area, exceeding those reported by other published sources for Neanthes, Gammarus mucronatus, Corophium louisianum, and Balanus amphitrite in marine coastal habitats. The rocky shoreline habitat is highly productive, and is an important refuge during periods of seasonal anoxia for Neanthes and for the other invertebrates that also serve as prey for fish and birds.

J	Beklioglu, M; Tan, CO				Beklioglu, Meryem; Tan, Can O.			Restoration of a shallow Mediterranean Lake by biomanipulation complicated by drought	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Whether fish biomanipulation is an efficient restoration technique in eutrophic warm sub/tropical lakes has been subject to recent debate. Our investigations undertaken in warm Lake Eymir, Turkey show that fish removal increased water clarity during a five-year period. Rapid re-colonisation of submerged plants, Potamogeton pectinatus and Ceratophyllum demersum, occurred. This recovery was achieved at higher total phosphorus (TP) levels than the suggested threshold for stability, probably owing to the nitrogen-limited condition of the lake. Re-establishment of vegetation coincided with significantly reduced concentrations of TP and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN). Abundance of the large-bodied Daphnia pulex was low and it later disappeared completely from the zooplankton community, probably due to increased fish predation. A severe drought, occurring two years after the fish removal, significantly lowered the water level, increased the hydraulic residence time and caused an expansion of the vegetation. The drought was also associated with a significant increase in salinity, conductivity, nutrient concentrations JP and DIN) and in the abundance of Arctodiaptomus bacillifer. The in-lake nutrient amounts became more dependent on internal processes rather than on the external loading, which was very low during the drought period. When the water level rose to normal values, the concentrations of TP and soluble reactive phosphate (SRP) decreased. However, the DIN concentration significantly increased due to slowed denitrification processes in consequence of the low availability of dissolved oxygen. This increase in ammonium concentrations may have contributed to the instability of clear-water conditions by releasing the lake from its former nitrogen-limited state, since the TP levels in the lake had already surpassed critical levels. Along with this, tench (Tinca tinca) biomass increased to pre-biomanipulation levels and the pike (Esox lucius) to planktivorous fish ratio decreased with increased chlorophyll-a concentrations, largely by inedible cyanobacteria, which led to a decline in summer water clarity but not to disappearance of submerged plants. The early growth of plants was probably controlled by the spring water clarity, which remained high, and the lake maintained its macrophyte-dominated state, despite the relatively turbid conditions prevailing in summer. The highly positive effect of the Lake Eymir restoration effort contradicts the experiences from other subtropical lakes. This could be due to the fact that warm Lake Eymir being at high latitude with a strong presence of predatory fish and limited abundance of planktivorous fish species, as opposed to low altitude warm lakes. However, drought as an inherent feature of the and region may be even more important in the future as drier conditions are predicted for the Mediterranean region in consequence of the global climate change.

Ecological Role of Cyprideis torosa and Heterocypris salina (Crustacea, Ostracoda) in Saline Rivers of the Lake Elton Basin: Abundance, Biomass, Production, Fatty Acids	ZOOLOGICAL STUDIES												Saline rivers are highly productive ecosystems in arid regions. The meiobenthic community (bottom meiofauna) and its dominant representatives are one of the least studied components of these aquatic ecosystems. Ostracods Cyprideis torosa and Heterocypris salina are major consumers among the species of bottom meiofauna in saline rivers flowing into the hyperhaline Lake Elton (Volgograd Region, Russia). We estimated the abundance, biomass and production of C. torosa, the dominant species at the mouth of the polyhaline Chernavka River (average salinity is similar to 30 g l(-1)), and H. salina, the dominant species at the mouth of the mesohaline Bolshaya Samoroda River (similar to 13 g l(-1)), in spring (May) and summer (August). Additionally, we studied the composition and content of fatty acids of the ostracods and their potential food sources (bottom sediments with bacterial-algal mats). We found that the abundance and biomass (wet weight with shells) of C. torosa in the Chernavka River and H. salina in the Bolshaya Samoroda River reached 3.5 x 10(6) ind. m(-2) and 117 g m(-2), and 1.1 x 10(5) ind. m(-2) and 12 g m(-2), respectively. The first species formed on average about 85% of the total abundance and 96% of the total biomass of the meiobenthos, and the second one, about 13% and 31%, respectively. The daily production of C. torosa and H. salina can reach 249 and 36 mg m(-2) ash-free dry weight, respectively. The results indicate that these species may play an important role in the total flow of matter and energy in the studied habitats. Based on the fatty acid (FA) composition of the ostracods and their food sources, it was found that C. torosa mainly consumed diatoms, while H. salina preferred bacteria, cyanobacteria, and green algae. Differences between the species were greater than differences between the bottom sediments from the rivers. It may mean that the ostracods selectively consumed different food items that may be related to the different nutrient requirements of the species. Seasonal changes in the FA compositions of the ostracods were higher than in their food sources (bottom sediments), which also indicates selective feeding of the species.

Interannual, summer, and diel variability of CH4 and CO2 effluxes from Toolik Lake, Alaska, during the ice-free periods 2010-2015	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												Accelerated warming in the Arctic has led to concern regarding the amount of carbon emission potential from Arctic water bodies. Yet, aquatic carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) flux measurements remain scarce, particularly at high resolution and over long periods of time. Effluxes of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) from Toolik Lake, a deep glacial lake in northern Alaska, were measured for the first time with the direct eddy covariance (EC) flux technique during six ice-free lake periods (2010-2015). CO2 flux estimates from the lake (daily average efflux of 16.7 +/- 5.3 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) were in good agreement with earlier estimates from 1975-1989 using different methods. CH4 effluxes in 2010-2015 (averaging 0.13 +/- 0.06 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) showed an interannual variation that was 4.1 times greater than median diel variations, but mean fluxes were almost one order of magnitude lower than earlier estimates obtained from single water samples in 1990 and 2011-2012. The overall global warming potential (GWP) of Toolik Lake is thus governed mostly by CO2 effluxes, contributing 86-93% of the ice-free period GWP of 26-90 g CO2,eq m(-2). Diel variation in fluxes was also important, with up to a 2-fold (CH4) to 4-fold (CO2) difference between the highest nighttime and lowest daytime effluxes. Within the summer ice-free period, on average, CH4 fluxes increased 2-fold during the first half of the summer, then remained almost constant, whereas CO2 effluxes remained almost constant over the entire summer, ending with a linear increase during the last 1-2 weeks of measurements. Due to the cold bottom temperatures of this 26 m deep lake, and the absence of ebullition and episodic flux events, Toolik Lake and other deep glacial lakes are likely not hot spots for greenhouse gas emissions, but they still contribute to the overall GWP of the Arctic.

A severe drought in the first decade of the new millennium in Australia increased the incidence of dust transport further. The major aims of this study were to characterize the bacterial communities in aerosols and their associated source sediments using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and to investigate the possibility of using HTS to link dust to its source, which has not been previously performed in this way. Four field campaigns were conducted at the recently evaporated saline playa Lake Gnarpurt in the Australian state of Victoria between 2008 and 2010 (3 in the austral summer, 1 in winter) to collect aerosol and sediment samples. Aerosol samples were collected on filters up to 150 m above the lake bed using a tethered helium-filled balloon. DNA was extracted from all samples using commercial kits, and the bacterial communities were examined using 454 HTS on the 16S rRNA gene. Over 200,000 sequences from 29 samples were analysed. In both sediment and aerosol samples, Salinimicrobium was the most abundant taxon; however, there was great variation and diversity across all samples. Analysis of similarities of the bacterial communities indicated that there was a significant overlap between the sediment samples and the aerosols collected above that location, showing that the bacteria in the air was derived from a subset of dust from a nearby source. The challenge remains to use bacterial profiling to link an aerosol sample to a distant source.

J	Strayer, DL; Smith, LC				Strayer, DL; Smith, LC			Relationships between zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) and unionid clams during the early stages of the zebra mussel invasion of the Hudson River	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. We monitored the density, recruitment and condition (body mass at a given shell length) of unionid clams in the freshwater tidal Hudson River before and during the early years of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) invasion of the river. Zebra mussels were first seen in the river in 1991 and were dominant by the end of 1992. 2. Despite high densities of zebra mussels in the Hudson, only 30% of the unionids were infested with zebra mussels, far fewer than predicted by published models of zebra mussel-unionid interactions. We do not know why so few unionids were colonized. 3. After the arrival of the zebra mussel, densities of unionid clams fell by 56%, recruitment of young-of-the-year unionids fell by 90%, and condition of unionids fell by 20-50%. These changes occurred in all three of the common unionid species in the river. 4. Elliptio complanata appears to have been less severely affected by the zebra mussel than were Anodonta implicata and Leptodea ochracea, judging by declines in density, recruitment and condition. 5. Our results suggest that unionids may be affected by zebra mussels by competition for food as well as by fouling.					; Strayer, David/H-3788-2011	Strayer, David/0000-0002-6767-4486; 													0046-5070					DEC	1996	36	3					771	779																WOS:A1996WA16200025
J	WEN, YH				WEN, YH			HYDROGRAPHIC VARIATIONS IN SIZE STRUCTURE OF PLANKTON BIOMASS IN A CHANGJIANG FLOODPLAIN LAKE	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The size structure of the planktonic community in a Changjiang floodplain lake (Lake Chenhu, Hubei, P. R. China) was described for the inundation period of May through September 1983. The modality of the Sheldon-type size distributions changed hydrographically with the spectral profiles being bimodal during low, rising, mid-high and falling water phases, and trimodal soon after filling and shortly before falling. The modal peaks corresponded respectively to the dominant organisms of chlorophytes and nauplii, while the troughs centered on the bacteria and macrocrustacean size classes in the lake. The slope of the normalized biomass spectrum (an index of plankton size distribution) was less than -1.0 for the filling and falling phases or close to -1.0 for the high water period, indicating that the planktonic biomass tended to decrease or evenly distributes across logarithmically ordered size classes, respectively. This observed variation in the size distribution of the plankton community mainly resulted from changes in water levels and contents of particulate inorganic matter (PIM) in the lake.																			0003-9136					FEB	1995	132	4					427	435																WOS:A1995QQ16800004

A.; Yang, Jiaqi; Shi, Peijian			Effects of Plant Coverage on the Abundance of Adult Mosquitos at an Urban Park	PLANTS-BASEL												People who take a walk in urban parks, including or adjacent to a water body such as a river, a pond, or a lake, usually suffer from mosquito bites in summer and early autumn. The insects can negatively affect the health and mood of these visitors. Prior studies about the effects of landscape composition on the abundance of mosquitos have usually taken stepwise multiple linear regression protocols to look for the landscape variables that can significantly affect the abundance of mosquitos. However, those studies have largely overlooked the nonlinear effects of landscape plants on the abundance of mosquitos. In the present study, we compared the multiple linear regression (MLR) with the generalized additive model (GAM) based on the trapped mosquito abundance data obtained by using photo-catalytic CO2-baited lamps placed at the Xuanwu Lake Park, a representative subtropical urban scenic spot. We measured the coverage of trees, shrubs, forbs, proportion of hard paving, proportion of water body, and coverage of aquatic plants within a distance of 5 m from each lamp's location. We found that MLR and GAM both detected the significant influences of the coverage of terrestrial plants on the abundance of mosquitos, but GAM provided a better fit to the observations by relaxing the limitation of the linear relationship hypothesis by MLR. The coverage of trees, shrubs, and forbs accounted for 55.2% of deviance, and the coverage of shrubs had the greatest contribution rate among the three predictors, accounting for 22.6% of the deviance. The addition of the interaction between the coverage of trees and that of shrubs largely enhanced the goodness of fit, and it increased the explained deviance of the GAM from 55.2% to 65.7%. The information in this work can be valuable for the planning and design of landscape plants to reduce the abundance of mosquitos at special urban scenic points.					; Peili, SHi/AAT-6450-2021; yang, yunfeng/KHT-9566-2024	Ratkowsky, David/0000-0002-7514-3570; Yang, Yunfeng/0000-0002-0294-8888													2223-7747					MAR	2023	12	5							983	10.3390/plants12050983	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants12050983								36903844					WOS:000947688900001

The aims of our study were to determine the predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) of MC-LR and to assess the ecological risk of MC-LR in the upstream section of the Haihe River. HC5 (hazardous concentration for 5% of biological species) and PNEC were obtained from a species sensitivity distribution (SSD) model, which was constructed with the acute toxicity data of MC-LR on aquatic organisms. The concentrations of MC-LR in the upstream section of the Haihe River from April to August of 2015 were analysed, and the ecological risk characteristics of MC-LR were evaluated based on the SSD model. The results showed that the HC5 of MC-LR in freshwater was 17.18 mu g/L and PNEC was 5.73 mu g/L. The concentrations of MC-LR ranged from 0.68 mu g/L to 32.21 mu g/L and were obviously higher in summer than in spring. The values of the risk quotient (RQ) ranged from 0.12 to 5.62, suggesting that the risk of MC-LR for aquatic organisms in the river was at a medium or high level during the study period. Compared with other waterbodies in the world, the pollution level of MC-LR in the Haihe River was at a moderate level. This research could promote the study of the ecological risk of MC-LR at the ecosystem level. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Treatment in deep wastewater stabilization ponds is influenced by thermal stratification. The object of this paper is the study, over a 1-yr period (October 1986-December 1987), of the influence of temperature on the behaviour of a treatment unit (an 8 m deep pond) which receives domestic wastewater. For this study, a spatiotemporal follow-up of the natural treatment process has been conducted. The removal efficiencies achieved for the following parameters varied as follows: COD, 71-92%; BOD5, 83-97%; total Kjeldahl nitrogen, 51-98.8%; ammonia nitrogen, 38.8-99.9%; total phosphorus, 42.2-92.9% and orthophosphate, 40-99%. Log reduction of microorganisms varied between 2.0 and 3.0 for total coliforms, 1.1-3.0 for faecal coliforms and 1.7-3.3 for faecal streptococcus. Other physiochemical parameters observed were: temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, nitrates and nitrites. The continuous flow of wastewater did not hinder the appearance of a marked stratification in spring-summer: an aerobic epilimnetic zone and an anaerobic hypolimnetic one remained clearly differentiated. The evolution of all the parameters observed was similar. In the absence of thermal stratification, the system was found to function in approximately complete mixing conditions, and the value of each parameter was almost constant throughout the water column; nevertheless, the presence of stratification caused a vertical distribution with marked gradients in the thermocline zone.

P concentrations in shallow water sediments decreased during the summer, and those in deep water sediments increased. A large increase in P concentration in the water occurred in late summer but was not due to diquat.

This improvement did not lead to the expected development of crustacean populations in the previously anoxic, zooplankton-deficient hypolimnion. The rotifer Filinia longiseta was the only zooplankter present, as isolated populations, in both the epilimnion and hypolimnion during summer. Of the summer zooplankton community, 80% occurred exclusively in the epilimnion; this was related to the development of an anoxic and toxic metalimnion that restricted migration from the epilimnion to the hypolimnion. Confinement of the zooplankton to the epilimnion coupled with predation by fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) appeared to be responsible for the change in the zooplankton community from large cladocerans and copepods to smaller species. Hypolimnetic aeration as a means of restoring or enhancing the production of cold-water fish probably can be thwarted by the development of a stable anoxic and toxic metalimnion that precludes the development of the zooplankton food resource.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1984	41	1					191	198		10.1139/f84-020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f84-020													WOS:A1984SJ22100020

Unique diet and Philonema sp. infections in reservoir-rearing juvenile Chinook Salmon	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Objective: Dams and reservoirs can alter juvenile growth and survival of migratory salmonids through several physical and biological mechanisms. Juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha that are produced upstream of large hydropower dams may have associated passage mortality, but the reservoirs created by these dams can support rapid growth. Characterizing the biotic drivers of growth and mortality in reservoirs may aid in understanding the cumulative effects of river impoundments on migratory salmonid populations. The purpose of this study was to understand how reservoirs facilitate rapid growth in juvenile Chinook Salmon. Methods: We analyzed stomach contents to determine diet composition throughout the summer and fall. We also recorded prevalence of the parasitic nematode Philonema sp. in the coeloms of fish. Result: We found that juvenile Chinook Salmon frequently consumed young-of-year centrarchids, which likely contributed to rapid growth. Piscivory was highest from July through October and decreased with surface temperature from November through December. Correspondingly, zooplankton and arthropod consumption increased in November and December. Prevalence of visible Philonema sp. infections in the coelom was high (34.6%), negatively associated with time, and nonlinearly associated with fork length. Conclusion: These findings reveal unique diet patterns and suggest potential parasite-associated mortality in reservoir-rearing Chinook Salmon, but more detailed studies across a longer time scale are needed to robustly assess the population-level effects of this parasite.

As phytoplankton and zooplankton are sensitive to changes in environmental conditions such as temperature, light intensity, and nutrients, understanding how environmental factors affect plankton community structure can help to predict the response of freshwater ecosystems to climate change. However, studies on the long-term monitoring of plankton community structure in Lake Soyang, an important source of drinking water for metropolitan areas in South Korea, and other domestic freshwater systems in Korea remain limited. Here, we investigated the changes in phytoplankton and zooplankton community composition in response to environmental factors in Lake Soyang during a long-term survey period. The results revealed that diatoms were negatively correlated (p < 0.001) with the water temperature and electric conductivity of the lake. Meanwhile, cyanobacteria and green algae, which appeared frequently in summer, were positively correlated (p < 0.05) with the pH and chlorophyll-a concentration of the lake. The occurrence patterns of diatoms were negatively correlated with all the zooplankton taxa identified in Lake Soyang; in contrast, the occurrence patterns of cyanobacteria, such HAB-causing Microcystis aeruginosa, and green algae were positively correlated with those of rotifera, copepoda, and protozoa. These findings will aid in predicting the impacts of climate change on freshwater ecosystems.																			1226-2617	2093-0860				SEP	2025	40	3					183	197		10.4490/algae.2025.40.8.12	http://dx.doi.org/10.4490/algae.2025.40.8.12													WOS:001589673900002

In the present study, we aimed at determining the concentration of radon in water sources from the southwest coastal region of Peninsular Malaysia. A total of 27 water samples were taken from various water sources which included groundwater, as well as hot spring, lake, river, seawater, and tap water; the radon concentrations were measured using a RAD7 portable radon detector. The radon concentrations ranged from 0.07 +/- 0.12 to 187 +/- 12 Bq l(-1), with an average of 21 +/- 12 Bq l(-1). The highest concentration was found in hot spring water, with an average concentration of 99 +/- 6 Bq l(-1), while the lowest concentration was found in tap water, with an average concentration of 1.95 +/- 0.61 Bq l(-1). The average concentrations of radon for all categories of sampled water were below the 100 Bq l(-1) WHO guidance level for safe drinking water. According to the ICRP effective dose conversion factor and UNSCEAR (2000), the total effective dose from the summation of inhaled and imbibed water was calculated from the aqueous radon concentrations, with an average effective dose of 4.45 mu Sv y(-1), well within the WHO safe drinking water guideline value of 100 mu Sv per year. The results of this study could support the efforts of authorities and regulators who are responsible for controlling and strategizing to ensure public safety against radon exposures.

In parallel, a discourse on local benefit sharing emphasizes that the population affected by dams should benefit from the projects in the long term. This raises the question of how international and local benefit sharing can be combined and whether these concepts are taken up in recent hydropower projects (HPPs) on shared rivers. This question was studied using the cases of the Ruzizi III and Rusumo Falls border river HPPs in Africa's Great Lakes region. The paper finds that the two projects indeed foresee both international and local benefit-sharing mechanisms, even if the actors involved hardly refer to international and local benefit sharing as concepts or link the two. At international level, the infrastructure will be jointly owned and electricity equally shared by the countries involved which can be considered good practice for border river projects. At local level, compensation processes are planned according to World Bank policies and various benefit- sharing mechanisms are envisioned. However, so far no revenue-based benefit sharing is foreseen that would ensure that the project-affected population will benefit in the long term.

Latest Pleistocene climate of the Altiplano is assumed to have been 20% wetter and 5 degreesC colder than today, based on previous modeling. Our simulation of lacustrine change since 15,000 cal yr B.P. is forced by these modeled climate changes. The latest Pleistocene Lake Titicaca was deep, fresh, and overflowing. The latest Pleistocene riverine discharge from the lake was about 8 times greater than the modern average, sufficient to allow the expansion of the great paleolake Tauca on the central Altiplano. The lake delta O-18 value averaged about -13 parts per thousand SMOW (the modern value is about -4.2 parts per thousand). The early Holocene decrease in precipitation caused Lake Titicaca to fall below its outlet and contributed to a rapid desiccation of paleolake Tauca. Continued evaporation caused the 100-m drop in lake level, but only a slight(1-2 parts per thousand) increase (relative to modern) in delta O-18 Of early Holocene lake waters. This Holocene lowstand level of nearly 100 m was most likely produced by a precipitation decrease, relative to modern, of about 40%, The lake was saline as recently as 2000 cal yr B.P.

Lawrence; Vuille, Mathias			High-resolution variability of the South American summer monsoon over the last seven millennia: insights from a speleothem record from the central Peruvian Andes	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Stable oxygen isotope (delta O-18) measurements of two speleothems, collected from Huagapo Cave in the central Peruvian Andes and with overlapping age from 1.1 to 1.4 ka, characterize tropical South American climate variability over the last 7150 years. In the study region, precipitation delta O-18 (delta O-18(p)) is inversely correlated to rainfall amount upstream in the Amazon Basin and the intensity of convection associated with the South American summer monsoon (SASM). Speleothem long-axis profiles yield an average age resolution of five years and permit investigation of climate over orbital to decadal timescales. Variations in the isotopic composition of Huagapo Cave calcite (delta O-18(c)) are in good agreement with several precipitation proxy records from ice cores, speleothems, and lake sediments from the central Peruvian Andes. From the mid-Holocene to today, delta O-18(c), a proxy for delta O-18(p), tracks changes in local insolation and exhibits a similar to 2 parts per thousand decrease. In the Late Holocene, Huagapo Cave delta O-18(c) is characterized by two periods of significant decline in SASM intensity (up to 1.5 parts per thousand increase in delta O-18(c)) even when insolation is reaching a local maximum and the SASM would be expected to intensify. These millennial-scale reductions in SASM intensity could in part be influenced by a reduction in the zonal SST gradient of the Pacific Ocean, favoring El Nino-like development.

The n-alkanes of Betula ermanii, Quercus castaneifolia and Fagus japonica revealed increased delta(13)C in autumn leaves compared with leaves sampled at the start of the growing season. Samples taken from Q. castaneifolia and F. sylvatica at monthly intervals showed gradual depletion of C-13 in bulk tissues and n-alkanes through the growing season. This may be a consequence of either recycling of depleted internal carbon in order to replace weathered waxes, or increased fractionation against C-13 by the enzyme ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase in response to increasing summer temperatures. Sitosterol exhibited similar isotopic trends as the n-alkanes in F. sylvatica, but shelved the opposite behaviour in Q. castaneifolia. The effect of sunlight intensity on delta(13)C was investigated in foliage sampled at different compass positions around two toes, Q. robur and F. sylvatica. Bulk tissue and lipids from inner shade leaves were consistently more depleted in C-13 than those from the corresponding sun leaf. The leaves receiving the highest sunlight irradiance on average, i.e. southern foliage, exhibited the lowest delta(13)C in lipids and bulk tissues. The variability of delta(13)C values with irradiance level may be due to changes in photosynthetic assimilation rates and the adaptation of the leaf epidermis and stomata in response to its light environment. Lipids and bulk tissues from leaves of Quercus species were found to possess slightly more depleted delta(13)C values than those in Fagus species, although interspecies variability was quite large. This study has important implications for the study of terrestrially derived organic matter preserved in ancient sediments. The results demonstrate the importance of elucidating the environmental factors that influence delta(13)C values of individual Lipids in modern leaves prior to using isotopic shifts in sedimentary and fossil lipids as indicators of palaeoenvironmental change.

From 51.9 to 30.6 kaBP, the vegetation was arid to semi-arid grassland with only slight changes. According to the palynomorphs, trees and shrubs were very rare. The large number and diversity of algae indicate the presence of a lake. Quantitative climatic conditions were reconstructed using the Best Analogues Method. The results indicate that the annual mean temperature was higher than that at present. The combination of temperature and annual precipitation suggests a change in the climate from cool dry to warm dry and then cool humid. Our results show that the annual precipitation values were mostly higher than that at present but were lower than 400 mm. It infers that the study area was already within the arid to semi-arid regions but with a stronger influence of the summer monsoon during 51.9 to 30.6 kaBP than at present. With slight differences mainly in time scale, the changing trend of the annual temperature curve is consistent with the other climatic records from Antarctica, Greenland, Hulu Cave (East China), and the Tibetan Plateau during the last glacial period. From 30.6 kaBP to present, very few palynomorphs were detected in the samples. Hence, no information about the vegetation and climate could be extracted. Combined with other studies during Late Pleistocene, we presume that the reason for the lack of pollen during this period was caused by an abrupt temperature fall after 30.6 kaBP or that the lacustrine conditions were unsuitable for pollen deposition. It was probably incurred by the oxidation on land prior to deposition. But for those samples only with algae, it might be caused by the fact that algae could finish their life history in a very short time in a seasonal lake.					li, jinfeng/GVS-5425-2022														1000-9515	1755-6724				OCT	2013	87	5					1444	1459		10.1111/1755-6724.12141	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-6724.12141													WOS:000325550700021

Modified or anthropogenic waterbodies can be used to compensate for habitat loss, with several amphibian species utilising created or modified waterbodies. We measured usage of anthropogenic/modified waterbodies by adult and tadpole frog species, including threatened species, in coastal wallum habitat in eastern Australia. Nine road trenches/ditches, 8 artificial 'lakes', 6 golf course waterbodies and 13 natural waterbodies were surveyed for frog adults and tadpoles during the summer/spring period 2011-2012. Additionally, we examined the relationship between frog assemblages and environmental factors (water chemistry, aquatic predators, vegetation types), focusing on Litoria olongburensis and Litoria fallax. Frog species richness differed between waterbody types, with two of three threatened frog species present in both natural and anthropogenic/modified waterbodies. The frog assemblage was influenced by pH, turbidity, salinity and percentage cover of certain vegetation types. Measured abundance of L. olongburensis adults and tadpoles were highest in natural waterbodies with high sedge density and low pH. The measured abundance of adult L. fallax was highest within artificial lakes. We conclude that differences in water chemistry and vegetation density can affect the amphibian assemblage within these environments. Therefore, effective conservation of all frog species would be enhanced by conserving a variety of waterbody types. However, natural waterbodies are more likely to be used by threatened species and the conservation of these waterbodies provides the best conservation outcomes. Where habitat offsets may be required, environmental managers should critically assess the quality of constructed habitat for specialist frog species including those associated with acidic, oligotrophic environments.					; Castley, Guy/A-7056-2010; Hero, Jean-Marc/A-4257-2010	Hero, Jean-Marc/0000-0003-0409-7885; Morrison, Clare/0000-0002-3245-4280; Castley, Guy/0000-0002-8418-5828; Shuker, Jon/0000-0002-0813-7402													1038-2097	2204-4604					2022	28	2					174	183		10.1071/PC20098	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/PC20098													WOS:000789198900007

However, whether cyanobacteria growth and toxin production are limited by N, P, or both N + P is still not clear. Thus, we conducted a nutrient enrichment bioassay in situ in Spring Lake, a eutrophic lake in west Michigan, USA, to examine the influence of nutrient limitation on the proliferation of algal blooms and the production of microcystins (MC). N or P addition alone resulted in a slight increase in the concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), suggesting a positive effect on phytoplankton growth, but alone, neither were sufficient to induce algal blooms. In contrast, the combination of N and P had a significant and positive influence on phytoplankton growth and MC production. Compared to controls, the N + P treatment resulted in high concentrations of Chl-a and MC, as well as high pH and dissolved oxygen. In addition, significant increases were observed in different MC analogues for each treatment; the highest concentrations of intracellular MC-LR, -RR, -YR, and TMC (total MC) were found in the N + P treatment with values of 9.16, 6.10, 2.57, and 17.82 mu g/L, respectively. This study suggests that at least in this temperate coastal lake, cyanobacterial blooms and associated MC are influenced more by combined N and P enrichment than by N or P alone, indicating that managing both nutrients is important for effectively reducing algal blooms and MC production.

A comment on The middle Holocene climatic records from Arabia: Reassessing lacustrine environments, shift of ITCZ in Arabian Sea, and impacts of the southwest Indian and African monsoons' by Enzel et al.	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Enzel et al. (2015) reassess sedimentary records of Early to Mid-Holocene lake sites in Arabia based on a reinterpretation of published multiproxy data and a qualitative analysis of satellite imagery. The authors conclude that these sites represent palaeo-wetland environments rather than palaeolakes and that the majority of the Arabian Peninsula experienced no or, if at all, only a very minor increase of rainfall at that time mainly due to eastward expansion of the East African Summer Monsoon. We disagree with their reassessment and identify several cases where unequivocal evidence for early Late Pleistocene and Early to Mid-Holocene perennial lake environments in Arabia, lasting for centuries to millennia, was neglected by Enzel et al. (2015). Here we summarize findings which indicate the presence of lakes from the sites of Jubbah, Tayma, Mundafan (all Saudi Arabia), Wahalah, Awafi (both UAE), and the Wahiba Sands (Oman), supported by evidence including occurrence of barnacle colonies in living position, remnant bioclastic shoreline deposits, undisturbed varve formation, shallowing-up lacustrine sequences, various aquatic freshwater, brackish and saline micro- and macrofossils, such as ichnofaunal remains, which are the result of prolonged field-based research. While the precise depth, hydrology and ecology of these water bodies is still not entirely resolved, their perennial nature is indicative of a markedly increased precipitation regime, which, in combination with more abundant groundwater and increased spring outflow in terminal basins fed by charged aquifers, was sufficient to overcome evaporative losses. The palaeolakes' influence on sustaining prehistoric populations is corroborated by the presence of rich archaeological evidence. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Nitze, I; Cooley, SW; Duguay, CR; Jones, BM; Grosse, G				Nitze, Ingmar; Cooley, Sarah W.; Duguay, Claude R.; Jones, Benjamin M.; Grosse, Guido			The catastrophic thermokarst lake drainage events of 2018 in northwestern Alaska: fast-forward into the future	CRYOSPHERE												Northwestern Alaska has been highly affected by changing climatic patterns with new temperature and precipitation maxima over the recent years. In particular, the Baldwin and northern Seward peninsulas are characterized by an abundance of thermokarst lakes that are highly dynamic and prone to lake drainage like many other regions at the southern margins of continuous permafrost. We used Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Planet Cube-Sat optical remote sensing data to analyze recently observed widespread lake drainage. We then used synoptic weather data, climate model outputs and lake ice growth simulations to analyze potential drivers and future pathways of lake drainage in this region. Following the warmest and wettest winter on record in 2017/2018, 192 lakes were identified as having completely or partially drained by early summer 2018, which exceeded the average drainage rate by a factor of similar to 10 and doubled the rates of the previous extreme lake drainage years of 2005 and 2006. The combination of abundant rain- and snowfall and extremely warm mean annual air temperatures (MAATs), close to 0 degrees C, may have led to the destabilization of permafrost around the lake margins. Rapid snow melt and high amounts of excess meltwater further promoted rapid lateral breaching at lake shores and consequently sudden drainage of some of the largest lakes of the study region that have likely persisted for millennia. We hypothesize that permafrost destabilization and lake drainage will accelerate and become the dominant drivers of landscape change in this region. Recent MAATs are already within the range of the predictions by the University of Alaska Fairbanks' Scenarios Network for Alaska and Arctic Planning (UAF SNAP) ensemble climate predictions in scenario RCP6.0 for 2100. With MAAT in 2019 just below 0 degrees C at the nearby Kotzebue, Alaska, climate station, permafrost aggradation in drained lake basins will become less likely after drainage, strongly decreasing the potential for freeze-locking carbon sequestered in lake sediments, signifying a prominent regime shift in ice-rich permafrost lowland regions.

J	HESSEN, DO				HESSEN, DO			FACTORS DETERMINING THE NUTRITIVE STATUS AND PRODUCTION OF ZOOPLANKTON IN A HUMIC LAKE	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Zooplankton egg production and nutritional status as related to environmental factors were studied in a humic lake. Both parameters exhibited a pronounced spring peak, a mid-summer depression and a second, smaller autumnal peak. The overall macrozooplankton community apparently suffered from severe food limitation, particularly with regard to food quality, during the study period. This limitation was confirmed with length/carbon regressions of well-fed and starved laboratory individuals of Daphnia. Body carbon in the lake animals corresponded to that of laboratory-raised, starved individuals. Regression analysis indicated that bacteria, particulate organic carbon and particulate nitrogen best explained changes in egg production, while algal biomass was of negligible importance for all species. For Daphnia, size-specific carbon content (length/carbon regressions) and C/N ratios were computed for all sampling dates. a and b from the equation W = aLb were positively correlated (P = 0.001). a ranged over 1.17-4.44 and was positively correlated with size-specific carbon content (P < 0.001) and the C/N ratio (P = 0.01). When a mean time lag of 12 was introduced, a was positively correlated with egg production (P = 0.046). b ranged over 2.05-3.54 and was inversely correlated to the same parameters. Both simple and multiple regression analysis confirmed that bacteria, particulate organic carbon and particulate nitrogen gave the major positive contribution to variance in size-specific C content, a and C/N ratio in Daphnia, whereas total zooplankton biomass was the main negative contributor to the same parameters.

J	Allen, MS; Tugend, KI; Mann, MJ				Allen, MS; Tugend, KI; Mann, MJ			Largemouth bass abundance and angler catch rates following a habitat enhancement project at Lake Kissimmee, Florida	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												A habitat enhancement project was conducted at Lake Kissimmee, Florida, during 1995-1996 to improve fish habitat and remove dense inshore vegetation caused by stabilized water levels. We evaluated abundance of age-1 (<250 mm total length [TL]) and adult (fish at least 356 mm TL and all sizes of fish caught by anglers) largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides before and after the habitat enhancement. Mean electrofishing catch per hour (CPH) of age-1 largemouth bass increased significantly after the 1995-1996 habitat enhancement, suggesting strong year-classes for 2 years after the habitat enhancement (i.e., 1997-1998 year-classes). Growth of age-1 largemouth bass also increased following habitat enhancement; mean total length of age-1 fish averaged 143 mm before enhancement and 186 mm after enhancement. Catch curves conducted in 2001 and 2002 corroborated historical electrofishing data indicating that the 1997 and 1998 year-classes were abundant as adults compared with other year-classes in the age frequencies. Age-1 largemouth bass electrofishing catch rates were not related to seasonal water levels or coverage of hydrilla Hydrilla verticillata. Despite the rapid growth rates and high abundance of the 1997 and 1998 year-classes, neither electrofishing catch rates of largemouth bass at least 356 rum TL nor angler catch rates of largemouth bass (fish/h, all sizes of fish, harvested or released; data from creel surveys) differed significantly between preenhancement and postenhancement periods. Thus, we were unable to detect a change in adult largemouth bass abundance or angler catch rates following the habitat enhancement. Fishing effort directed toward largemouth bass declined after enhancement for the winter period (November-February) but did not differ significantly between preenhancement and postenhancement periods for the summer (May-August) period. Benefits of muck removal concurrent with lake drawdowns include increased recreational opportunities and improved habitat. However, our results indicate that fish population responses to drawdowns and muck removals may vary and detecting effects on the adult largemouth bass populations can be difficult. Therefore, habitat enhancement efforts should focus on lakewide recreational benefits rather than benefits to a single preferred species (e.g., largemouth bass).

J	Ono, T; Mori, T; Tsunomori, F				Ono, Takato; Mori, Toshiya; Tsunomori, Fumiaki			High-frequency field auto-sampling of volcanic waters discharged near craters of active volcanoes	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												Temporal changes in volcanic water chemistry are reliable indicators of changes in volcanic activity. Conventionally, volcanic water discharges are monitored through repetitive sampling and subsequent laboratory analysis. Samples are usually taken at intervals ranging between weekly and annually due to the campaign-style of observations. However, samples collected in this way to track chemical changes were insufficient in terms of number, frequency, and temporal coverage/completeness to allow quantitative tracking of volcanic activity. In this study, we thus developed a field auto-sampling tool for collecting volcanic waters discharged near craters to improve the frequency of water sampling. The basis of the developed tool is a commercially available XY plotter, a drawing robot, which can be controlled by a computer numerical control (CNC) operator code called G-code. To collect the water in the arranged sampling bottles, the drawing pen of the XY plotter was replaced with a plastic drip pipe connected to a peristaltic pump. A field test using the G-code-Operated Field Auto-sampling Tool (GOFAT) was conducted at a hot spring at a crater area of Hakone volcano in Japan. Samples were collected at three-hour intervals for 40 consecutive days. The GOFAT successfully operated without stopping and collected a total of 332 water samples. Using the high temporal resolution samples obtained by the GOFAT, we observed short-term significant positive SO4 peaks that endured for approximately a day, which had not been detected by a repetitive sampling carried out in previous studies at this volcano. Our results clearly show the importance of high temporal resolution sampling, even during quiescent periods, to clarify the characteristics of the observed hot spring.

Nahal Zin has incised -50 m into relatively soft late Pleistocene Lake Lisan sediments. Incision was forced by the regressive (>10 km) lake level fall of a total of >200 m of Lake Lisan from its highest stand at similar to 25 ka and exposure of the lake-floor sediments to fluvial and coastal processes. Alluvial cut terraces of the incising channel are well preserved along the 17.5 km of the lowermost reach of Nahal Zin. At its outlet into the Dead Sea basin, Nahal Zin deposited a Holocene alluvial fan at the base of a 10-80 m high escarpment in unconsolidated sediments. The escarpment is associated with the Amazyahu fault, which forms the southern structural boundary of the present Dead Sea basin. Geomorphic mapping, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages, and soil stratigraphy allowed correlation of terrace remnants and reconstruction of several past longitudinal profiles of Nahal Zin and its incision history. Together with the published lake level chronology, these data provide an opportunity to examine stream incision related to base level lowering at a millentrial scale. OSL ages of the terraces fit relatively well with the established lake level chronology and follow its regression and fall. For a few thousands of years the longitudinal profile response to the lake level fall was downstream lengthening onto the exposed former lake bed. Most of the incision (-40 m) occurred later, when the lake level reached the top of the Amazyahu fault escarpment and continued to drop. The incision was a relatively short episode at about 17 ka and cut through this escarpment almost to its base. The fast incision, its timing, and the profiles of the incising channels indicate that the escarpment was an underwater feature and was not formed after the lake retreated. This fairly simple scenario of regressive lake level fall and knickpoint exposure and incision is modeled here using a one-dimensional numerical incision model based on a linear diffusion equation. The calculated diffusion coefficient fits earlier results and data obtained from other streams in the area and confirms the upscaling of this simple model to the millennial scale.

J	Hatano, N; Kawano, R; Yoshida, K				Hatano, Nozomi; Kawano, Ritsuho; Yoshida, Kohki			Lake-level responses to climate change in an inland basin in the Japanese Islands during the last 16 kyr	GEOMORPHOLOGY												During the last deglaciation and middle Holocene, rapid climatic changes occurred repeatedly. Previous research has primarily focused on investigating these periods in East Asia's coastal and inland regions of the Eurasian continent. In contrast, a limited number of studies have reported on climate change and its environmental impacts in island areas near the Pacific Ocean. This study aims to reconstruct paleosol drainage conditions and lake water level fluctuations in the Suwa Basin, an inland basin in central Japan, after the last deglaciation. We utilize the identification of paleosols and the geochemistry of lacustrine sediments to discuss climate change and its impacts on terrestrial environments in the East Asian coastal region. During the Last Glacial Maximum, the basin experienced a lowstand period; meandering fluvial systems led to the development of dry and well-drained paleosols. The lacustrine environment expanded between ca. 16 cal kyr BP and 5 cal kyr BP during a transgressive period. Short-term lake-level fluctuations were reconstructed by examining repeated paleosol development and changes in the bulk SiO2 content originating from biogenic silica in lacustrine sediments. Our data suggest that the lake's water level fell at ca. 12 cal kyr BP, 8 cal kyr BP, and 7 cal kyr BP. After 5 cal kyr BP, thin paleosols repeatedly formed during short exposure times due to the rapid sedimentation rate in the delta system, which corresponds to the highstand period. Short-term fluctuations between 16 kyr BP and 5 kyr BP, in the lake water level in the inland basin of the Japanese Islands was influenced by drying and cooling trends in the East Asian coastal region, as well as declines in sea surface temperatures in the western tropical Pacific Ocean. These fluctuations roughly synchronize with the Younger Dryas stadial and an 8.2 ka cooling event. Changes in precipitation, which responded to fluctuations in the East Asian summer monsoon intensity and tropical depressions, likely regulated the lake water level. These findings imply the predominant influence of paleoclimate fluctuations over thousands of years on the hydrological regime of lake systems across the island area of the East Asia.

However, the utilization of satellite-based remote sensing data offers new possibilities for such investigations. In the present study, vegetation greening, vegetation moisture and lake distribution derived from medium-resolution satellite imagery were analyzed over the Pechora catchment for the last 35 years. Here, we considered the entire Pechora catchment and the Pechora Delta region, located in the northern part of European Russia, and we investigated the vegetation and lake dynamics over different permafrost zones and across the two major biomes, taiga, and tundra. We also evaluated climate data records from meteorological stations and re-analysis data to find relations between these dynamics and climatic behavior. Considering the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) in the summer, we found a general greening and moistening of the vegetation. While vegetation greenness follows the evolution of summer air temperature with a delay of one year, the vegetation moisture dynamics seems to better concur with annual total precipitation rather than summer precipitation, and also with annual snow water equivalent without lag. Both NDVI and NDMI show a much higher variability across discontinuous permafrost terrain compared to other types. Moreover, the analyses yielded an overall decrease in the area of permanent lakes and a noticeable increase in the area of seasonal lakes. While the first might be related to permafrost thawing, the latter seems to be connected to an increase of annual snow water equivalent. The general consistency between the indices of vegetation greenness and moisture based on satellite imagery and the climate data highlights the efficacy and reliability of combining Landsat satellite data, ERA-Interim reanalysis and meteorological data to monitor temporal dynamics of the land surface in Arctic areas.

Phytoplankton Cell Size in Saline Lakes	RESEARCH JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL SCIENCES												We studied 62 of the most abundant species from 7 lakes and 121 phytoplankton samples collected during 20072013. We compared the algal cell volumes in the studied lakes with the averaged species-specific cell volume. From all studied species, we observed a downward trend in cell size in the summer, when there was an active biomass production. Salinity is a regulatory factor for the value of cell surface and, thus, for the intensity of the metabolic processes of the organisms at the first trophic level. The cell volume for most studied species in partly ephemeral lakes (Levadne, Chervone, and Ozero) was generally higher than in perennial lakes (Ripne, Veysove, Garache, and Slipne) and thus it can be assumed that the ecological succession stage of ephemeral lakes has a more significant effect on the dimensional characteristics of algae than the factors related to seasonal summer desiccation and water salinity. Previously, dimensional characteristics of algal cells in non-marine water bodies has been calculated for freshwater lakes only, therefore the data obtained for the mineralized lakes are presented for the first time and can be used for the purpose of monitoring of saline lakes ecosystem.					; Barinova, Sophia/AAH-6720-2019	Barinova, Sophia/0000-0001-9915-2503; 													0975-8585					JAN-FEB	2016	7	1					1077	1085																WOS:000410536300027

Analyses of the seismic data, together with radiocarbon dating, magnetic, sedimentologic, isotopic, and paleontologic studies of core samples, have allowed us to reconstruct lake-level changes during this recent part of the lake's history. The post-glacial history of lake-level changes in the Lake Michigan basin begins about 11.2 ka with the fall from the high Calumet level, caused by the retreat of the Two Rivers glacier, which had blocked the northern outlet of the lake. This lake-level fall was temporarily reversed by a major influx of water from glacial Lake Agassiz (about 10.6 ka), during which deposition of the distinctive gray Wilmette Bed of the Lake Michigan Formation interrupted deposition of red glaciolacustrine sediment. Lake level then continued to fall, culminating in the opening of the North Bay outlet at about 10.3 ka. During the resulting Chippewa low phase, lake level was about 80 m lower than it is today in the southern basin of Lake Michigan. The rise of the early Holocene lake level, controlled primarily by isostatic rebound of the North Bay outlet, resulted in a prominent, planar, transgressive unconformity that eroded most of the shoreline features below present lake level. Superimposed on this overall rise in lake level, a second influx of water from Lake Agassiz temporarily raised lake levels an unknown amount about 9.1 ka. At about 7 ka, lake level may have fallen below the level of the outlet because of sharply drier climate. Sometime between 6 and 5 ka, the character of the lake changed dramatically, probably due mostly to climatic causes, becoming highly undersaturated with respect to calcium carbonate and returning primary control of lake level to the isostatically rising North Bay outlet. Post-Nipissing (about 5 ka) lake level has fallen about 6 m due to erosion of the Port Huron outlet, a trend around which occurred relatively small (+/- approximately 2 m), short-term fluctuations controlled mainly by climatic changes. These cyclic fluctuations are reflected in the sedimentological and sediment-magnetic properties of the sediments.

J	Elbert, M				Elbert, Monika			Haunting Transcendentalist Landscapes: EcoGothic Politics in Margaret Fuller's Summer on the Lakes	TEXT MATTERS-A JOURNAL OF LITERATURE THEORY AND CULTURE												In this essay, the reminiscences of Margaret Fuller, feminist activist and member of the American Transcendentalist movement, from her journey to the Great Lakes region, entitled Summer on the Lakes (1844), are considered in the light of EcoGothic considerations. The essay shows how Fuller's journey disillusioned her about progress and led to abandoning the serene vision of nature and landscapes reflected in the works of Transcendentalists. The destruction of nature and landscape verging on an ecological catastrophe is presented by Fuller in the perspective of the Gothic, as a price for the technological development driven by the capitalist economy. The Gothic character of Summer on the Lakes derives from the mental condition of the writer and a pessimistic vision arising from the debunking of the myth of America as a virgin land. Fuller's work constitutes an EcoGothic tribute to the indigenous inhabitants of Americabut also a Gothic live burial of the Native Americans who do still live in the regions she visits-as well as to Mariana and Frederica, unusual and gothicized women excluded from society. By bringing together Fuller's observations about nature, indigenous peoples and marginalized women, the essay shows how Fuller's text prophetically announces the beginning of the end of the American environment.																			2083-2931	2084-574X				NOV	2016	6	1					53	73		10.1515/texmat-2016-0004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/texmat-2016-0004													WOS:000399128100004

Changes in water quality variables at a mid-depth site after proliferation of dreissenid mussels in southeastern Lake Michigan	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Studies evaluating the impacts of dreissenid mussels in Lake Michigan have largely focused on changes in phytoplankton dynamics in the offshore region (i.e., >100 m depth) even though mussel biomass is actually highest in mid-depth coastal regions of Lake Michigan (i.e., 30-50 m). Here we report on changes at the base of the food web during 1995-2014 at a mid-depth site located in southeastern Lake Michigan. Specifically, we evaluated trends in Secchi depth, surface mixed layer chlorophyll-a and total phosphorus (TP), sub-epilimnetic deep chlorophyll layer concentrations, and near bottom chlorophyll-a concentrations and whether there have been shifts in the seasonal patterns of these variables. Median chlorophyll-a concentrations declined over 63 % during the spring isothermal period following the sharp increase in mussel abundance between 1996-2002 and 2007-2014. Chlorophyll-a concentrations in the spring were generally between 2 and 3 mg m(-3) in 1996-2002, but almost never exceeded 1 mg m(-3) in 2007-2014. Secchi depths increased in all months between 1996-2002 and 2007-2014, with the greatest changes being observed in the spring. Total phosphorus in the surface mixed layer declined over the study period, but not at as fast a rate as chlorophyll-a, a change consistent with mussel invasions. There was a 90 % decline in the median depth integrated deep chlorophyll-a concentration between 1995-2000 and 2007-2014 in June when this feature was at its peak. Chlorophyll-a concentrations in the near bottom zone also decreased over time, likely due to their constant contact with dreissenid mussels. The declines in chlorophyll-a and changes in nutrient dynamics at the mid-depth site are consistent with dreissenid induced impacts that have also been documented at deeper, offshore sites in Lake Michigan.					; Fahnenstiel, Gary/ABD-6133-2020	Pothoven, Steven/0000-0002-7992-5422; 													1863-9135					AUG	2016	188	3					233	244		10.1127/fal/2016/0883	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/fal/2016/0883													WOS:000381324600005

Movement patterns and home range use of the northern watersnake (Nerodia sipedon)	COPEIA												The factors that influence spatial use and movement patterns in ectotherms may have important fitness consequences. To examine the effects of sex and condition on spatial use, we used radio telemetry to observe the movement of 18 adult Nerodia sipedon in a southwest Missouri lake. Snakes generally remained in close proximity (< 5 m) to aquatic habitats throughout the summer. Home range size estimates differed according to calculation method. Monthly total home range sizes peaked in mid-summer, possibly in response to increased amounts of vegetative cover, although core area sizes were consistent across the season. Contrary to previous studies of snakes, mean movement rates and home range sizes of male and gravid female N. sipedon were statistically indistinguishable and highly variable. Body size and condition influenced spatial characteristics of females, but only appeared to influence movement frequency of males. When compared to other populations, we found that our population of N. sipedon tended to occupy similarly-sized shifting core areas associated with aquatic vegetation. Future studies should focus on the measurement of resource distribution to further understand the factors influencing variation in snake movements and spatial patterns.																			0045-8511	1938-5110				SEP 15	2006		3					544	551		10.1643/0045-8511(2006)2006[544:MPAHRU]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1643/0045-8511(2006)2006[544:MPAHRU]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000240652400023

Long term cost-effectiveness of resilient foods for global catastrophes compared to artificial general intelligence safety	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION												Global agricultural catastrophes, which include nuclear winter and abrupt climate change, could have long-term consequences on humanity such as the collapse and nonrecovery of civilization. Using Monte Carlo (probabilistic) models, we analyze the long-term cost-effectiveness of resilient foods (alternative foods) -roughly those independent of sunlight such as mushrooms. One version of the model populated partly by a survey of global catastrophic risk researchers finds the confidence that resilient foods is more cost effective than artificial general intelligence safety is-84% and-98% for the 100 millionth dollar spent on resilient foods and at the margin now, respectively. Another version of the model based on one of the authors produced-93% and-99% confidence, respectively. Considering uncertainty represented within our models, our result is robust: reverting the conclusion required simultaneously changing the 3-5 most important parameters to the pessimistic ends. However, as predicting the long-run trajectory of human civilization is extremely difficult, and model and theory uncertainties are very large, this significantly reduces our overall confidence. Because the agricultural catastrophes could happen immediately and because existing expertise relevant to resilient foods could be co-opted by charitable giving, it is likely optimal to spend most of the money for resilient foods in the next few years. Both cause areas generally save expected current lives inexpensively and should attract greater investment.

The development of cerrado vegetation appears to have begun 6000 years ago, initially with the establishment of an open cerrado, followed from 4800 cal a BP by a change to a woody cerrado driven by an increase in summer insolation. The increases in precipitation levels in the central Cerrado during the last 5000 years are related to the increased influence of the Amazon in central Brazil, which has facilitated biomass burning and anthropogenic activities in the region of Lake Feia. Multi-centennial-scale changes in water level-related and gallery forest pollen assemblages indicate three main dry episodes, at 3440-2760, 2700-1690 and 1330-1150 cal a BP, linked to regional shifts between northern and southern South American summer monsoon boundaries. The presence of low continuous fire activity does not appear to have affected vegetation recovery, whereas two intervals with increased fire activity, at similar to 3300 and similar to 1300 cal a BP, indicated a slower recovery.

J	Beltaos, S				Beltaos, Spyros			Hydrodynamic properties of ice-jam release waves in the Mackenzie Delta, Canada	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Ice breakup is a controlling factor in the hydrology of arctic Deltas, including the Mackenzie River Delta, which is characterized by numerous channels and lakes. Ice jams that form during dynamic spring breakup events often result in flooding, thus replenishing Delta lakes with essential water, sediment and nutrients. The present study, carried out under the auspices of the International Polar Year, aims to gather and analyze essential quantitative information for iniproving understanding of Delta ice processes and associated prediction capability. Recent work has shown that dynamic breakup in the flat Delta channels can only be triggered by javes, the sharp waves generated by ice jam releases, which amplify the hydrodynamic forces applied on, and can dislodge, the winter ice cover. First-ever measurements of javes in Delta channels are presented and their hydrodynamic properties quantified via the Rising Limb Analysis Method (RLAM), which enables calculation of the hydrodynamic properties of the measured waveforms. Typical leading edge and crest celerities were 10 and 5 m/s respectively, while a record value of 16.5 m/s was obtained on one occasion and linked to large local depths in Middle Channel. The hydrodynamic forces applied on the riverbed and the ice cover, resulting from various javes, are subdued in Delta channels relative to those in the lower Mackenzie River and in other, previously studied, rivers. This is primarily due to low water surface slope and points to a northward-decrease in the incidence of dynamic breakup and ice jams in Delta channels.

Repeat photography of Lake Michigan coastal dunes: Expansion of vegetation since 1900 and possible drivers	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Coastal dunes are prominent features along the Lake Michigan shoreline, especially along Michigan's Lower Peninsula. Numerous studies in recent years have reconstructed the geomorphic history of these dune systems, from their initial formation in the mid-Holocene to about 300 years ago. These studies have suggested linkages between past dune behavior and climatic variability and fluctuating lake levels. Less is known, however, about how these dune systems change on shorter-temporal scales in the modern era and the potential drivers of that change. Using repeat photography, this paper attempts to demonstrate how the coastal dunes of Lake Michigan's eastern shore have changed since the 19th century. We collected hundreds of photographs of these dunes, taken between the years 1885 and 2018, from archives and citizen scientists. In the spring and summer of 2019, we took -70 new photographs replicating the original images. The changes between coastal dune conditions in the original photographs and in the 2019 photographs show a general expansion of vegetation across formerly barren and active surfaces along the entire shoreline. Although human development has also played a role in reshaping the coastal dune systems, the most pronounced difference between historical and current dune conditions where repeat photography was conducted is the expansion of vegetation - grasses, shrubs, and even trees. Here, we present the 20 photograph pairs most representative of these trends, explore these changes, and discuss the likely causes, including the increase in precipitation in Michigan in the past -80 years.

Sediments deposited before 1885 contain low abundances comprising species associated with very oligotrophic lakes. Between 1885 and 1925 abundance increases slowly as does the ratio of planktonic diatoms to benthic diatoms and chrysophyte remains. These trends accelerate in sediments deposited between 1925 and 1964, most rapidly between 1954 and 1964. Maximal microfossil abundance occurs in sediments deposited .apprx. 1964 and numbers, particularly of oligotrophic species with summer abundance maxima, decline thereafter. This sequence appears to reflect progressive eutrophication of Lake Michigan culminating in silica limitation during summer stratification after the mid-1960s.

Despite the abundance of continental records of Holocene climate, few have sufficient chronological control and sampling resolution to compare with the Greenland findings(4). But annually laminated sediments (varves) from lakes can provide high-resolution continental palaeoclimate data with secure chronologies. Here we present analyses of varved sediments from Deep Lake in Minnesota, USA. Trends in the stable oxygen-isotope composition of the sedimentary carbonate indicate a pronounced climate cooling from 8.9 to 8.3 kyr before present, probably characterized by increased outbreaks of polar air, decreased precipitation temperatures, and a higher fraction of the annual precipitation falling as snow. The abrupt onset of this climate reversal, over several decades, was probably caused by a reorganization of atmospheric circulation and cooling of the Arctic airmass in summer that resulted from the final collapse of the Laurentide ice near Hudson Bay and the discharge of icebergs from the Quebec and Keewatin centres into the Tyrell Sea. The timing and duration of this climate reversal suggest that it is distinct from the prominent widespread cold snap that occurred 8,200 years ago in Greenland and other regions(1,5,6). No shifts in the oxygen-isotope composition of sediment carbonate occurred at 8.2 kyr before present at Deep Lake, but varve thickness increased dramatically, probably as a result of increased deposition of aeolian dust. Taken together, our data suggest that two separate regional-scale climate reversals occurred between 9,000 and 8,000 years ago, and that they were driven by different mechanisms.

Here we reconstruct an EASM precipitation history of the past similar to 500 years based on sedimentary multi-proxy indices from Lake Daihai, northern China. We find low EASM precipitation between similar to AD 1517 and similar to 1850, with three sharply weakened intervals, which were broadly concurrent with the Chinese dynastic and cultural transitions. The EASM intensified after similar to AD 1850, changing from cold-dry to warm-wet conditions, with greater multidecadal variability. These features match well with the coeval sea surface temperature (SST) records over the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans, suggesting that changes in global SSTs could have forced changes in EASM intensity and modulated regional hydroclimate on these timescales. We propose that the increased interhemispheric temperature gradients associated with the recent global warming might push northward the western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH), the westerlies, and the monsoon front. Meanwhile, the multi-decadal warming in the North Atlantic may also strengthen the westerlies and the EASM. These multiple factors could have collectively led to higher precipitation in the converging zone of the westerlies and the WPSH since similar to AD 1850.

Samples of swine wastewater, lake water and groundwater collected from two pig farms in central China were used to test the applicability of the multi-residue analysis method. The average antibiotics concentrations in groundwater, lake water, final effluent and influent swine wastewater were, respectively, 1.6-8.6, 5.7-11.6, 7.9-1172.3 and 8.5-21692.7 ngL(-1) in summer; respectively, 2.0-7.3, 6.7-11.7,5.8-409.5 and 32.8-11276.6ngL(-1) in winter. The limits of quantification were 0.8-4.1,1.4-5.5,1.8-11.5 and 6.4-104.4ngL(-1), respectively, in groundwater, lake water, final effluent and influent swine wastewater. Results of multi-residue analysis of antibiotics in the samples indicate that SAs, FQs and TCs were widely used veterinary medicines in the pig farms. As compared with previous studies, higher elimination rates (more than 80%) of the antibiotics (except DC) were observed in effluent in this study. More detailed work is indispensable to investigate the fate and transport of antibiotics in the environment and to find out cost-effective approaches of removing antibiotics from swine wastewater and contaminated sites.

Snow track counts for density estimation of mammalian predators in the boreal forest	WILDLIFE RESEARCH												Context. Methods for estimating density of meso-carnivores in northern ecosystems are labour intensive and expensive to implement if mark-recapture and radio collaring are used. One alternative is to count tracks in the snow along transects as an index of density, but this method has been criticised as imprecise and lacking validation. Aims. We aimed to examine the utility of track counts along snowmobile trails in the snow for measuring changes in populations of Canada lynx and coyotes in the boreal forest of north-western Canada. Methods. We compared winter track counts of Canada lynx at three study sites and of coyotes at one site with concurrent estimates of density based on locations of radio-collared animals and estimates of numbers of uncollared animals from three 7-9-year studies in the Yukon and Northwest Territories, during a period of cyclical population fluctuations. Key results. Snow track counts were positively correlated (r(2) = 0.83) with density of Canada lynx, estimated by live trapping and radio collaring in the three survey areas. Coyotes also showed a clear relationship (r(2) = 0.80) between known density and snow track counts, but track counts were strongly affected by season, with much higher counts in the early winter when snow was shallower. This indicates the need to control for season or snow depth when using track counts as indices of coyote abundance. We recommend sample sizes of at least 10 track counts per winter along a 25-km transect to maximise precision. Conclusions. Snow track counts are a relatively simple, inexpensive method of concurrently tracking abundance of multiple species of meso-carnivores. These data indicate that track counts may be reliably used to monitor trends in numbers, but we suggest site-specific validation of the regressions reported here between tracks and animal abundance are required to translate these indices into estimates of density. Implications. Track counts have the potential to be an affordable alternative to more intensive methods of monitoring trends in abundance of medium-sized mammals, for purposes such as management of harvest or to measure the success of programs to increase or reduce population abundance.					; Boutin, Stan/NGR-3670-2025	O'Donoghue, Mark/0000-0001-7706-6962; Poole, Kim G/0009-0001-6693-6659; 													1035-3712	1448-5494					2023	50	6			SI		425	434		10.1071/WR21159	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WR21159		OCT 2022											WOS:000863617800001

Constraining the recent history of the perennially ice-covered Lake Bonney, East Antarctica using He, Kr and Xe concentrations	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Lake Bonney is a perennially ice-covered lake in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs) that has long been studied in order to provide constraints on the paleoclimate of West Antarctica. The lake is divided into two lobes, West Lake Bonney (WLB) and East Lake Bonney (ELB) that are separated by a narrow ridge. The two lobes currently receive surface melt water during austral summers from glacier-fed ephemeral streams and this meltwater enters the lake via a narrow ring, or moat, of liquid water that forms around the lake during summer. The West Lobe also receives water from direct input of melt water from Taylor glacier and saline water from irregular subglacial discharge. Here, we combine previously published He data from Lake Bonney with new Kr and Xe concentration data to examine the signatures of water recharge via the seasonal moat and these data are used to constrain a model for He, Kr and Xe transport within both WLB and ELB over about the last 5000-6000 yrs. A detailed numerical simulation is presented that combines diffusive transport of noble gases within the stratified water column of Lake Bonney, along with ice ablation at the top of the ice cover, partitioning of noble gases between water and ice, plus exchange of noble gases between WLB and ELB. Results strongly suggest that open moats have only operated for about 2-3 centuries within the last millennium. These results are corroborated by the high concentration of He, especially within WLB, which points to a history of ice cover with no open moats operating for both lobes for at least about 5 millennia. In addition, the distribution of He, Kr and Xe suggest that a significant rise of the water level of Lake Bonney associated with a warmer period may have been interrupted by a roughly 4-5 century long cold period during which the moats were not large enough to allow air saturated water into the lake, with this cold period ending about one century ago. In addition, during this cold period, there is evidence for a thickening of the ice cover. In the last century Lake Bonney levels have been rising, pointing either to more extended austral summers or elevated summer temperatures, a rise that is compatible with the heavy noble gas record in the upper portion of the lake. A preliminary analysis that includes all stable noble gases heavier than He, suggests that glacial melt water (GMW) directly from Taylor Glacier below the ice cover may have been a significant input into the deepest parts of WLB, but not ELB.

Forest canopy characteristics (canopy closure and size of gaps) and browse supply were measured and contrasted with data collected on sites with cottage development and sites with no development. The canopy closure of conifers was greater on undeveloped sites than on developed sites. Openings in the shoreline fringe of conifer cover on developed sites did not show increased forage production typical of openings in forests because cottagers removed underbrush and established lawns. Winter browse supply was four times lower on developed cottage lots than on undeveloped shoreline sites. Cottage development reduced the carrying capacity for deer by lowering food supply and thermal cover provided by mature conifer trees. Cottage development which minimizes removal of conifers and underbrush from the shoreline fringe will minimize the impact of development on deer habitat.																			0008-3550					APR-JUN	1995	109	2					201	204																WOS:A1995TB34800005

Oxygen isotope composition of water and snow-ice cover of isolated lakes at various stages of separation from the White Sea	DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES												This study aimed to analyze the oxygen isotope composition of water, ice, and snow in water bodies isolated from the White Sea and to identify the structural peculiarities of these pools during the winter period. The studies were performed during early spring in Kandalaksha Bay of the White Sea, in Velikaya Salma Strait and in Rugoserskaya Inlet. The studied water bodies differ in their degree of isolation from the sea. In particular, Ermolinskaya Inlet has normal water exchange with the sea; the Lake on Zelenyi Cape represents the first stage of isolation; i. e., it has permanent water exchange with the sea by the tide. Kislo-Sladkoe Lake receives sea water from time to time. Trekhtsvetnoe Lake is totally isolated from the sea and is a typical meromictic lake. Finally, Nizhnee Ershovskoe Lake exhibits some features of a saline water body. The oxygen isotope profile of the water column in Trekhtsvetnoe Lake allows defining three layers; this lake may be called typically meromictic. The oxygen isotope profile of the water column in Kislo-Sladkoe Lake is even from the surface to the bottom. The variability of delta O-18 is minor in Lake on Zelenyi Cape. A surface layer (0-1 m) exists in Nizhnee Ershovskoe Lake, and the oxygen isotope variability is well pronounced. Deeper, where the freshwater dominates, the values of ?18AZvary insignificantly disregarding the water depth and temperature. This fresh water lake is not affected by the seawater and is not stratified according to the isotope profile. It is found that applying the values of ?18AZ and profiles of temperature and salinity may appear as an effective method in defining the water sources feeding the water bodies isolated from the sea environment.

Effects of adaptation (by comparing mussels from a southern and a northern population) and thermal acclimation of the mussels were considered. Both heterotrophic flagellates and algae are released from grazing pressure and increase in abundance at temperatures above 20 degrees C. Bacterial abundance, however, decreased with increasing temperature, suggesting a trophic cascade (mussel-flagellates-bacteria) that is altered by the temperature response of the mussel ingestion rate. Warm acclimation of the mussels did not change the outcome of the experiments. The dreissenids from the southern population showed a significantly higher ingestion rate than those from the northern population only in July. The general pattern (i.e., decreasing ingestion rates at high temperatures) was found in both populations. Microbial communities controlled by macrofauna can experience substantial changes in warm summers because of differential development of direct and indirect grazing effects with increasing temperature.

These campaigns included the use of a scanner laser system, for detecting the glacier surface topography, and a helicopter-borne ice penetrating radar, for measuring ice thicknesses. These surveys allowed determining the snow and ice volume storage at this volcano, volume which is susceptible to melt during eruptive events generating dangerous fast flows (lahars). Volcan Villarrica is one of the most active volcanoes in Chile, with frequent eruptive events, many of them associated with lahars which are considered the most hazardous process at this volcano. In fact, most of the casualties and infrastructure damages incurred during historical eruptive events at the volcano are associated with lahars. With use of the radar and laser data, a total volume of 1.17 +/- 0.1 km(3) of water equivalent (w.eq.) at the volcano in 2012 was calculated, only 37 % of the estimated volume of 1961, a reduction mainly explained by the area shrinkage and ice thinning rates observed in the last 51 years. This total volume represents a lower boundary available for melting during eruptive events when lahars mudflows can be generated, because mainly in the winter, nearly 0.14 km(3) w.eq. are potentially added to the volcano as temporal snow falls. The volume of water equivalent lost in recent decades does not mean a lower risk associated with these flows, as there has been a huge increase in populated areas in the surroundings of the volcano in recent years.					; Oberreuter, Jonathan/JMQ-2244-2023	Oberreuter, Jonathan/0000-0003-3294-9010; Rivera, Andres/0000-0002-2779-4192; Uribe Parada, Jose Andres/0000-0002-5281-2719; gimeno, fernando/0000-0003-0723-5251													0921-030X	1573-0840				JAN	2015	75	1					33	55		10.1007/s11069-014-1306-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-014-1306-1													WOS:000345971600003

Dust source activation frequency across East Asia	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Plumes of mineral dust in East Asia deleteriously impact the health and livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people in Mongolia, China, Korea, and Japan and perturb Earth's energy balance and climate. However, the sources of this dust are not well-documented, limiting understanding of dust emissions. Here, we systematically quantify dust source activation frequency (DSAF) across East Asia (80-130 degrees E; 27-52 degrees N) between January 2016 and December 2023. Our data reveal a vast dust-active area extending from the Tibetan Plateau (TP) in the southwest to the Huin Bair Sandy Land in the northeast, but two regions dominate: southern sources centered on the margins of the Taklimakan Desert and northern ones centered on the valleys of the Gobi Desert. East Asia is most dust-active in boreal spring (46% of all recorded events). This seasonal peak is pronounced in northern sources where snow cover, vegetation and orographic/topographic influence on winds are clear controls on DSAF. The main southern sources are active year-round with DSAF hotspots attributable to desiccated lakes and riverbeds. The TP, commonly considered a sink for in-bound windblown dust, is also a dust source, particularly in winter, with emissions controlled by precipitation patterns, snow cover and wind funneling through deep river gorges. Contrary to suggestions, our data show that the Loess Plateau is not a major dust source. We document a marked increase in dust source activation during the 2020 extreme heat wave on the overgrazed Mongolian Plateau grasslands. Our data provide a framework to study past variability in the two-way climate interactions that control dust emissions on historical and geological timescales and a baseline from which to measure future change.					; Schepanski, Kerstin/I-7967-2015	Chen, Lingle/0000-0002-3525-9480; 													1748-9326					JUL 1	2025	20	7							074056	10.1088/1748-9326/addee6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/addee6													WOS:001511109000001

Since this species has been continuously declining for over 200 years, conservation actions are necessary to prevent its extinction. To identify the best sites for an assisted colonisation of the species in the area, we carried out experiments posing 120 plantlets grown from seeds from the natural population in each of 5 sites within a 20 km range from the natural population. Environmental, demographic and meteorological parameters were monitored for 8 years at each site to evaluate the response to our intervention. Demographic changes occurred at different rates, reflecting the effect of environmental factors on new plants establishment and survival; the final survival rate of reintroduced plants was 45.3%. Unlike winter temperature, summer drought had a strong negative impact on plant survival. Inter-population comparison suggests a formerly wider distribution of the species, and bodes well for the survival of the newly created populations. Differentiating between ecological factors influencing growth and those regulating reproductive biology and success of new generations will help to improve long-term fitness and viability in assisted colonisation projects.

The experiment was designed using six different rice-winter crop rotations: rice-fallow (RF), rice-wheat (RW), rice-potato with rice straw mulch (RP), rice-green manure (Chinese milk vetch; RC-G), rice-oilseed rape (RO), and rice-green manure crop (oilseed rape with fresh straw incorporated into soil at flowering; RO-G) and three N rates, N0 (0 kg N ha(-1)), N1 (142.5 kg N ha(-1)), and N2 (202.5 kg N ha(-1)). Average rice yields in the RF (5.93 t ha(-1)) rotation were significantly lower than those in the rotations with winter crops (7.20-7.48 t ha(-1)) under the NO treatment, suggesting that incorporation of straw might be more effective for increasing soil N than winter fallow. The rice yield differences among the rotations varied by year with the N input. In general, the grain yields in the RP and RO-C rotations -were respectively 11.6-28.5% and 14.80-37.19% higher than those in the RF in plots with N applied. Increasing the N rate may have tended to minimize the average yield gap between the RF and the other rotations; the yield gaps were 18.55%, 4.14%, and 0.23% in N0, N1, and N2, respectively. However, the N recovery efficiency in the RF was significantly lower than that in other rotations, except for 2015 under both N1 and N2 rates, a finding that implies a large amount of chemical N loss. No significant differences in nitrogen agronomic efficiency (NAE) and physiological efficiency (NPE) were found between the rotations with legume (RC-G) and non-legume (RO and RW) winter crops, a result that may be due partly to straw incorporation. For this reason, we concluded that the return of straw could reduce differences in N use efficiency between rotations with and without legume crops. The degree of synchrony between the crop N demand and the N supply was evaluated by comparison of nitrogen balance degree (NBD) values. The NBD values in the RP and RW were significantly lower than those in the other rotations under both N1 and N2 rates. Thus, in view of the higher grain yield in the RP compared to the RW under the N1 rate, the RP rotation might be a promising practice with comparable grain yield and greater N use efficiency under reduced N input relative to the other rotations. The primary yield components of the RF and RP were identified as number of panicles m(-2) and numbers of kernels panicle(-1), respectively. The NAE and NPE were positively correlated with harvest index, possibly providing a useful indicator for evaluating N use efficiency.

A multiscale analysis of heatwaves and urban heat islands in the western US during the summer of 2021	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Extreme heat events are occurring more frequently and with greater intensity due to climate change. They result in increased heat stress to populations causing human health impacts and heat-related deaths. The urban environment can also exacerbate heat stress because of man-made materials and increased population density. Here we investigate the extreme heatwaves in the western U.S. during the summer of 2021. We show the atmospheric scale interactions and spatiotemporal dynamics that contribute to increased temperatures across the region for both urban and rural environments. In 2021, daytime maximum temperatures during heat events in eight major cities were 10-20 & DEG;C higher than the 10-year average maximum temperature. We discuss the temperature impacts associated with processes across scales: climate or long-term change, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, synoptic high-pressure systems, mesoscale ocean/lake breezes, and urban climate (i.e., urban heat islands). Our findings demonstrate the importance of scale interactions impacting extreme heat and the need for holistic approaches in heat mitigation strategies.																			2045-2322					JUN 13	2023	13	1							9570	10.1038/s41598-023-35621-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-35621-7								37311771					WOS:001011884700013
J	Hrycik, AR; Stockwell, JD				Hrycik, Allison R.; Stockwell, Jason D.			Under-ice mesocosms reveal the primacy of light but the importance of zooplankton in winter phytoplankton dynamics	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Factors that regulate planktonic communities under lake ice may be vastly different from those during the open-water season. Expected changes in light availability, ice cover, and snowfall associated with climate change have accelerated the need to understand food web processes under ice. We hypothesized that light limitation (bottom-up control) outweighs zooplankton grazing (top-down control) influence on phytoplankton biovolume and community structure under ice in a north temperate lake. Using in situ under-ice mesocosm experiments, we found that light had stronger effects on phytoplankton abundance than zooplankton, as expected. Specifically, low light limited growth of diatoms, cryptophytes, and chrysophytes. Zooplankton, however, also significantly affected some individual phytoplankton groups by decreasing diatoms and cryptophytes, in contrast to the common assumption that zooplankton grazing has negligible effects under ice. Ammonium and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) were lowest in high light treatments presumably through uptake by phytoplankton, whereas ammonium and SRP were highest in high zooplankton treatments, likely a result of zooplankton excretion. In situ experimental studies are commonly applied to understand food web dynamics in open-water conditions, but are extremely rare under ice. Our results suggest that changes in the light environment under ice have significant, rapid effects on phytoplankton growth and community structure and that zooplankton may play a more active role in winter food webs than previously thought. Changes in snow and ice dynamics associated with climate change may alter the light environment in ice-covered systems and significantly influence community structure.					; Stockwell, Jason/HSC-4786-2023	Hrycik, Allison/0000-0002-0870-3398; Stockwell, Jason/0000-0003-3393-6799; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				FEB	2021	66	2					481	495		10.1002/lno.11618	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11618		OCT 2020						33776144					WOS:000574847800001
J	ROYLE, RN; KING, RJ				ROYLE, RN; KING, RJ			AQUATIC MACROPHYTES IN LAKE LIDDELL, NEW-SOUTH-WALES - BIOMASS, NITROGEN AND PHOSPHORUS STATUS, AND CHANGING DISTRIBUTION FROM 1981 TO 1987	AQUATIC BOTANY												The distribution and density of submerged angiosperms in Lake Liddell, New South Wales, were surveyed each summer from 1981 to 1987. The size of the area colonised by vegetation increased markedly between 1981 and 1984 but subsequently changed little. Until summer 1983, the submerged angiosperms occurred to depths of 5 m but by summer 1985 had extended to greater depths and by 1987 the lower limit was 8 m. At this depth, it appears that the light intensity is often less than 1% of surface irradiance. During the period of the survey, Potamogeton crispus L. and Najas marina L. became less abundant while Potamogeton perfoliatus L., Vallisneria spiralis L. and Potamogeton pectinatus L. increased in abundance. In 1987, biomass estimates were made for all major species. The average biomass of plants in the vegetated zone was 573.5 g dry weight (DW) m-2, with a maximum value of 3632 g DW m-2 for V. spiralis. Ninety-six percent of the estimated biomass was contributed by two species only, P. perfoliatus and V. spiralis. Tissue phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations measured in summer 1987 ranged from 0.053 to 0.350% and 0.82 to 3.24%, respectively. The total amounts of phosphorus and nitrogen held within the vegetation were estimated to be 1.4 t and 14.4 t, respectively. A new method of determining whether nitrogen or phosphorus is more likely to limit growth is discussed.																			0304-3770	1879-1522				SEP	1991	41	4					281	298		10.1016/0304-3770(91)90048-A	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(91)90048-A													WOS:A1991GF86200002

This study turns the focus toward smaller Icelandic glaciers, presenting geodetic mass-balance estimates for 14 of them (total area 1,005 km(2)in 2017) from 1945 to 2017, in decadal time spans. These glaciers, distributed over the country, are subject to different climatic forcing. The mass balance, derived from airborne and spaceborne stereo imagery and airborne lidar, is correlated with precipitation and air temperature by a first-order equation including a reference-surface correction term. This permits statistical modeling of annual mass balance, used to temporally homogenize the mass balance for a region-wide mass balance assessment for the periods 1945-1960, 1960-1980, 1980-1994, 1994-2004, 2004-2010, and 2010-2017. The 14 glaciers were close to equilibrium during 1960-1994, with an area-weighted mass balance of 0.07 +/- 0.07 m w.e. a(-1). The most negative mass balance occurred in 1994-2010, accounting for -1.20 +/- 0.09 m w.e. a(-1), or 21.4 +/- 1.6 Gt (1.3 +/- 0.1 Gt a(-1)) of mass loss. Glaciers located along the south and west coasts show higher decadal mass-balance variability and static mass-balance sensitivities to summer temperature and winter precipitation, -2.21 +/- 0.25 m w.e. a(-1)K(-1)and 0.22 +/- 0.11 m w.e. a(-1)(10%)(-1), respectively, while glaciers located inland, north and northwest, have corresponding mass-balance sensitivities of -0.72 +/- 0.10 m w.e. a(-1)K(-1)and 0.13 +/- 0.07 m w.e. a(-1)(10%)(-1). These patterns are likely due to the proximity to warm (south and west) vs. cold (northwest) oceanic currents.					; Berthier, Etienne/B-8900-2009; Adalgeirsdottir, Gudfinna/M-3073-2015	Belart, Joaquin M.

Here, we evaluated the effects of changes in water level and submerged macrophyte status on wintering waterbird community size, functional group abundances, functional diversity (FD), and community assembly by using a dataset compiled over 50 years. We built generalised linear models to evaluate the effects of water level and submerged macrophyte status on the above-listed attributes of the waterbird communities by using mid-winter waterbird censuses, water level measurements, and submerged macrophyte surveys, along with submerged macrophyte macrofossil records from two shallow lakes in Turkey. Using a relevant set of functional traits, we defined functional groups, calculated four FD measures, and simulated null distributions of the FD measures for assessing assembly rules. We found that macrophyte-dominated years had significantly higher abundances of waterbirds in one of the study lakes, and had more diving herbivores and omnivores in both lakes, while diving/scooping fish-eating waterbird abundance was lower in macrophyte-dominated years. Community size in Lake Beysehir exhibited a negative association with water level; surprisingly, however, none of the functional group abundances and FD indices were significantly related to water level. In our study communities, standardised effect sizes of functional richness and functional dispersion-two indices that are particularly sensitive to community assembly processes-were mostly lower than those of randomly assembled communities, which implies functional clustering. Shifts to a scarce-macrophyte state were associated with increases in these two indices, possibly due to either changes in the relative strength of environmental filtering and limiting similarity in community assembly or sampling of transitional communities. Further studies covering a wider range of the trophic/macrophyte status spectrum are needed to be certain. The results of this study indicate that shifts between abundant and scarce-macrophyte states can have significant effects on wintering waterbird abundances, FD and community assembly. The results also suggest that shallow lakes in macrophyte-dominated states can support more wintering waterbirds, especially diving omnivores, some of which are globally threatened.

J	Sebestyen, SD; Schneider, RL				Sebestyen, SD; Schneider, RL			Dynamic temporal patterns of nearshore seepage flux in a headwater Adirondack lake	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Although seepage in lakes is known to vary as a function of precipitation and watershed characteristics, temporal patterns of seepage flux over daily and weekly time scales have not been extensively studied with a concentrated effort of direct measurement of seepage in nearshore areas. In this study, seepage was intensively measured with seepage meters over two summers and during snowmelt in Lower Sylvan Pond, a small lake in the Adirondack Mountains region of New York State, USA. A consistent pattern of slight discharge (never exceeding 105 mL m(-2) h(-1)) was observed at three stations along a segment of the shoreline near the inlet stream. A distinct temporal pattern of seepage was observed at three stations along another portion of the shoreline. Seepage discharged (> 400 mL m(-2) h(-1)) for a portion of the summer in 1998 and then shifted to recharge (<-500 mL m(2) h(-1)) for the remainder of the summer. A similar temporal pattern was observed again in 1999 but the transition to recharge occurred earlier and higher rates of discharge (610 mL m(-2) h(-1)) and recharge (-608 mL m(-2) h(-1)) were recorded. Additionally, seepage at these three stations increased after large rainfall events and a pronounced episodic increase of seepage was measured during snowmelt. Distinct seepage patterns along portions of the shoreline show that seepage can vary considerably within seasons and suggests a need to consider changes of seepage over time periods of days to weeks as well as among seasons and years. This study demonstrates that the resolution of temporal seepage data can be important to the understanding of water fluxes to aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Average phosphorus concentrations decreased by 64-92% in low-flow wetlands (to 11-40 mu g P/L) and by 53-90% (to 12-57 mu g P/L) in high-flow wetlands. Intensive sampling at 4-h intervals during spring and summer of the final year showed phosphorus mass decreases of 81-74% for low- and high-flow wetlands, respectively. During this frequent sampling, inflow averaged 176 mu g P/L, while outflows were 34 mu g P/L for the low-flow wetland and 45 mu g P/L for the high-flow wetland. Spatial patterns of isopleths showed clear gradients in high-flow wetlands and near-homogeneous concentrations in low-flow wetlands. Annual budgets illustrated that most inflowing phosphorus was retained through sedimentation with some capacity for phosphorus retention by macrophytes and a lesser amount by microbial (periphyton acid planktonic) communities. A simple Vollenweider-type model predicted well the retention of phosphorus in these wetlands for low- and high-flow wetlands with 3 yr of data, i.e., the model was calibrated and verified with six independent data sets. A mean deviation of only 9.3% between measured and simulated retention was found when the retention coefficient was k = 6.51 wk(-1). Adding a factor for seasonal temperature fluctuation did not improve the fit, whereas using a model where the retention is a function of flow provided the best overall fit to the data (mean deviation of 6.3% between data and predictions). These constructed wetlands retained about the same amount of phosphorus per unit area (0.5-3 g P . m(-2). yr(-1)) as have several other natural and constructed wetlands receiving similar concentrations of phosphorus.

Long-Term Oxbow Lake Trophic State under Agricultural Best Management Practices	WATER												A key principle of agricultural best management practices (BMPs) is to improve water quality by reducing agricultural-sourced nutrients and associated eutrophication. Long-term (1998-2016) lake summer trophic state index (TSI) trends of an agricultural watershed with agricultural best management practices (BMPs) were assessed. Structural BMPs included vegetative buffers, conservation tillage, conservation reserve, a constructed wetland, and a sediment retention pond. TSI included Secchi visibility (SD), chlorophyll a (Chl), total phosphorus (TP), and total nitrogen (TN). Summer TSI 1977 was >80 in 1998-1999 (hypertrophic) and decreased over the first 10 years to TSI 1977 approximate to 75 (eutrophic). TSI 1977 decrease and changing TSI deviations coincided with vegetative buffers, conservation tillage, and conservation reserve. The TSI(SD) decrease (>90 to <70) coincided with vegetative buffers and TSI(TP) decrease (>90 to <75) coincided primarily with conservation tillage and the sediment retention pond. TSI(Chl) increase (70) coincided with conservation tillage and vegetative buffer. Results indicate watershed-wide BMPs can modestly decrease summer trophic state through increased water transparency and decreased TP, but these changes are off-set by increases in chlorophyll a to reach a new stable state within a decade. Future research should assess algal nutrient thresholds, internal nutrient loading, and climate change effects.

Due to their excessive costs and the relatively insignificant outcomes of some of these techniques, the process of artificial aeration is one of the most promising methods. Four strategic techniques for the control of nutrients are selected for this study: artificial destratification by the bubble plume, partial (or total) lift hypolimnetic aerator, bubble plume oxygenation and Speece cone oxygenation. Each of these methods has both advantages and disadvantages. Technical and economic analyses established by different researchers reveal that hypolimnetic oxygenation is most favorable for nutrient control. In hypolimnetic aeration systems, the bubble plume appears to be most economical and perhaps most simple among the systems proposed for Standley Lake (Colorado, USA), even as other researches selected the Speece cone aeration system in other applications. Based oil existing hypolimnetic aeration research, this Study provides a synthesis of a number of issues related to the aeration in lakes and reservoirs, including the advantages and disadvantages of these aeration systems. This study also concentrates on the economic and technical aspects associated with these aeration systems. We found that the use of oxygen limits the nitrogen Saturation and in contrast with using air. We demonstrate that the most efficient hypolimnetic aeration system is the bubble plume diffuser, although accidental destratification may occur. The destratification can be used in winter because the temperature of the lake is not modified. However, the hypolimnetic aeration is used in summer in order to avoid the homogenization of the lake temperature during this period.

Surface water samples were taken between July 2008 and October 2009 in weekly intervals from each lake. The following parameters were determined: pH, salinity, electric conductivity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), the major cations (FAAS and ICP-OES) and the major anions (IC), as well as certain trace elements (ICP-OES). Samples of superficial sediments were taken in October 2009 and examined using Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) for their major and trace element content including rare earth elements (REE). Both lakes are highly alkaline with a dominance of Na > K > Si > Ca in cations and HCO3 > CO3 > Cl > F>SO4 in anions. Both lakes also exhibited high concentrations of Mo, As and fluoride. Due to an extreme draught from March to October 2009, the water level of Lake Nakuru dropped significantly. This created drastic evapoconcentration, with the total salinity rising from about 20 parts per thousand up to 63 parts per thousand. Most parameters (DOC, Na, K, Ca, F, Mo and As) increased with falling water levels. A clearchange in the quality of DOC was observed, followed by an almost complete depletion of dissolved Fe from the water phase. In Lake Bogoria the evapoconcentration effects were less pronounced (total salinity changed from about 40 parts per thousand to 48 parts per thousand). The distributions of REE in the superficial sediments of Lake Nakuru and Lake Bogoria are presented here for the first time. The results show a high abundance of the REE and a very distinct Eu depletion of Eu/Eu* = 0.33-0.45. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

J	Khan, TA; Wilson, ME; Khan, MI				Khan, TA; Wilson, ME; Khan, MI			Evidence for invasive carp mediated trophic cascade in shallow lakes of western Victoria, Australia	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Conference on Limnology of Shallow Lakes	MAY 25-30, 2002	BALATONFURED, HUNGARY	Veszprem Univ, Acad Sci & Dept Limonol, Balaton Linmol Inst Hungarian				Lakes of western Victoria are typically shallow (2-3 m), slightly saline (3-8 ppt) and eutrophic (total phosphorus 0.1-5 mg l(-1) and total nitrogen 3-8 mg l(-1)). These lakes are prone to algal blooms in late spring and summer. We conducted experiments in ponds to determine whether lake zooplankton exert enough grazing pressure to control algal blooms and also if carp predation can regulate zooplankton communities and increase algal biomass. Zooplankton grazing (high zooplankton, low zooplankton and control) and carp predation (carp, nutrient and control) experiments had three treatments and each treatment had three replicates. Algal numbers and biomass (28 mug l(-1)) were uniform in all ponds before zooplankton stocking. When stocked with lake zooplankton, algae were consumed efficiently and after 30 days algal numbers and biomass were significantly lower than those in control ponds (0.4 mug l(-1) and 33 mug l(-1), respectively). Ponds stocked with low zooplankton numbers were intermediate. Complete elimination of Cladocera and subsequent increase in algal biomass (from 4 to 45 mug l(-1)) occurred after 30 days in carp treatment ponds. Zooplankton and algal populations were unaffected when nutrients but no carp were added and also in control ponds with no added nutrients or carp. The pond experiments illustrated the mechanics of a carp mediated trophic cascade when stocked with species and densities of zooplankton naturally occurring in lakes of western Victoria. Confirmation of whether this process occurs in turbid Australian lakes is urgently required.																			0018-8158					NOV 15	2003	506	1-3					465	472		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008558.48008.63	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008558.48008.63													WOS:000188455600062

One portion of wellfield site selection addressed here includes analysis of ambient groundwater quality and its potential for contamination. This study also addresses the potential impacts of groundwater withdrawals to existing legal users, wetlands, surface waters and spring flows. A regional groundwater flow model (MODFLOW) was constructed using existing hydrogeologic data from state and federal agencies in order to simulate the existing hydrologic conditions of this karst area and to predict withdrawal impacts. The model was calibrated by matching potentiometric surface maps and spring flows to within reasonable ranges. Drawdowns in the Floridan and surficial aquifers predicted by the model show minimal impacts to existing legal users and only a 5% reduction in the flow at Ichetucknee Springs ca 21 km (13 miles) away. Due to the karstic nature of the Floridan aquifer here, the equivalent-porous-medium flow model constructed would not be appropriate for contaminant transport modeling. The groundwater flow model is, however, appropriate to represent hydraulic heads and recharge/discharge relationships on a regional scale. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Koç, C				Koc, Cengiz			The influence of drainage projects on environmental and wetland ecology	ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS												This study researched how the drainage project of Koycegiz plain in the Special Environment Protection Region in the western Mediterranean basin of Turkey impacted the wetlands and sweet gum forests (Liquidambar orientalis) around Lake Koycegiz. The quality of and the change in the surface water and the water table, and their impact on environment and wetlands were researched. The level of water table in A-zone wetland adjacent to Lake Koycegiz varied between 0.0 and 0.50 m. In some parts of the fields paralleling to A-zone wetland, and called B-zone, the water table level was also between 0.50 and 1.00 m. Anions (Cl(-) and SO(4)(-)) and cations (Na(+), K(+), Ca(2+), and Mg(++)) increased twofold in water samples obtained from A and B zone wetland compared to the irrigation water used in the research area. The mean of salinity in water table and irrigation water ranged from 545 to 1423 mu S cm(-1). The mean of water table salinity in A and B zone wetland was 1689 mu S cm(-1). Electrical conductivity (salinity) and compositions of ions provided an indication of changes occuring in A and B zone wetland function. Wetlands and sweet gum forests were impacted adversely in summer period when the water table fell down below the level necessary for meeting the demands.

The results showed that the microbial networks were distinctly different among seasons, and the most complex network in autumn exhibited the highest stability. We found that the strong connecting structures among microbes (large modules) were significantly (P < 0.05) correlated with water temperature and pH, which would negatively affect keystone taxa and destabilize microbial communities. The networks with more keystone taxa were generally stable and the removal of keystone taxa would result in unstable networks. Moreover, the keystone taxa were specific among seasons due to environmental filtering and relevant interspecific interactions. These results suggested that seasonal variations of environmental factors could influence microbial networks and community stability via the regulation of keystone taxa. Thus, the keystone taxa could be used as indicators to reflect the seasonal stability of microbial communities in lake ecosystems. These findings improve our understanding of the microbial seasonal co-occurrence patterns and reveal the mechanism how microbial communities maintain their seasonal stability in aquatic ecosystems.					; He, Zhili/OCL-4904-2025; Liu, Shengwei/D-8768-2011	Yan, Qingyun/0000-0003-0053-892X; Zeng, Jiaxiong/0000-0003-4206-4072; Liu, Shengwei/0000-0001-6418-2884; Yu, Huang/0009-0007-6258-5314; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				MAR	2022	136								108695	10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.108695	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.108695		FEB 2022											WOS:000761397500001

Lake Morphometry Controls Chloride Retention and Modulates Impacts of Road Salt on Stratification in Urban Lakes	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Road salt inputs have caused widespread salinization of urban lakes in northern temperate regions. Watershed characteristics related to road salt application rates are known to be important drivers of lake chloride concentrations, but there has been less focus on how lake morphometry and climate influence seasonal and interannual dynamics in lake chloride, and how these chloride levels may alter mixing in the water column. We analyzed chloride retention for two urban lakes in Saint Paul, Minnesota with adjacent watersheds and similar surface areas that contrast in depth and water residence time. Summer chloride concentrations were negatively related to total summer precipitation for the shallower lake (Como Lake; maximum depth 2.2 m), but the relationship was substantially weaker for the deeper lake (Lake McCarrons; maximum depth 7.6 m). We used a zero-dimensional model to simulate chloride dynamics in both lakes and tracked the fate of chloride over time. In Como Lake, the mass of chloride in the lake turns over within three years, whereas chloride inputs are retained for >10 years in Lake McCarrons. We then used a one-dimensional hydrodynamic lake model (GLM-AED) to examine how chloride loading rates alter lake mixing across a wide range of lake morphometry. Salt inputs significantly extended the duration of summer stratification for simulated lakes with depths >8 m, which may exacerbate anoxic conditions. These results underscore the importance of considering lake morphometry in understanding and managing for the effects of salt inputs on lake ecosystems.

In lakes, DVM has mainly been studied in the upper 50 m of the water column. However, based on acoustic and net sampling data collected in Lake Geneva, Switzerland (similar to 309 m depth) during summer 2022, we demonstrate that DVM occurs down to similar to 125 m depth daily throughout the summer season. The daily descents terminated at around zenith when the Relative Rate of light Change (RRC) was the lowest, and the late afternoon ascent started when RRC values exceeded -0.005 s(-1). DVM migration descent/ascent rates were asymmetric with faster mean upward rates (4.5x10(-3)ms(-1)) than downward rates (-3.5x10(-3)ms(-1)). Migration rates overall increased as summer progressed, corresponding to the intra-seasonal increase in RRC. Cyclopoid copepods Cyclops prealpinus abundances correlated with the observed deep DVM and their migration responded to exogenous light cues. These new findings, which can also be expected to be relevant for other deep lakes, indicate that Lake Geneva's DVM greatly exceeds maximum migration depths previously reported for a lake. Thus, it is important to study zooplankton DVM dynamics throughout the entire water column in large, deep lakes since it plays an important role in buffering global climate change effects. Furthermore, it is suggested that present zooplankton DVM sampling protocols in large, deep lakes should be revised accordingly.

Elements differed considerably in their distribution between above- and belowground parts and the amount of apparent exchange between parts. The ratio of the amount of as an element in aboveground plant parts to that belowground (A:B) was between 1:1 and 2:1 for most elements, as compared with the 2:2:1 ratio of biomass. The maximum amounts of Fe and Zn belowground exceeded their aboveground maxima, while K, Ca and Mn had A:B ratios greater than 2:1. N, P and K in belowground plant parts decreased considerably during the spring, and belowground decreases were large enough to be potentially important sources of these elements for shoot growth. Belowground stores of Ca, Mg, Mn, Na and Sr decreased little in the spring and do not function as reserves.																			0304-3770	1879-1522				MAY	1988	30	4					343	352		10.1016/0304-3770(88)90066-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(88)90066-6													WOS:A1988P339400006

Since these basins are remote and hard to access, multisensoral remote sensing is a valuable method to gather the necessary water budget components with appropriate spatial coverage and with high temporal resolutions. Thus the lake level elevation changes of the central Tibetan lake Nam Co were examined in example by a comparison of satellite altimetry (RA-2/ENVISAT, GFO radar altimeters and GLAS/ICESat laser altimeter for the period 2000-2009) and the evaluation of a time series of optical satellite data dating back to 1976 (Landsat) and 1965 (Corona) in order to validate hydrological water budget modelling results. The combination of all three altimeters revealed a rising trend of lake level on average by 0.31 m/year in the period 2000-2009 which corresponds to a total volume change of 6.2 km(3). This is in a good agreement with simulated average lake level rise of 0.35 m/year obtained from distributed hydrological modelling (Krause et al., 2010). The movements of lakeshore measured on the satellite imagery confirm the trend revealed by the altimetry data and they also indicate the rising trend since 1965. While GFO provides a dense time series of data the more accurate ENVISAT/RA-2 data unfortunately feature large data gaps over Tibet. The measurements from time limited campaigns of ICESat validate the results of radar altimetry and they provide unlike radar altimeters a valid height over lake ice during winter and spring period. The results show that the presented approach is a valuable contribution to understand the impact of changing climate on the hydrology of Tibetan lakes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In the context of a research agreement with the Monti Sibillini National Park, the ISPRA Geological Survey of Italy is carrying on some studies aimed to evaluate the supposed effects of the 2016-2017 Central Italy earthquakes on the hydrogeological conditions controlling the lake's evolution. The study, started in July 2018, aims primarily at the reconstruction of the geological and hydrogeological subsoil setting, beneath the valley hosting the lake. In order to define the conceptual model of groundwater circulation and, thus, to evaluate the emptying and recharge seasonal cycle of the lake, hydrogeological surveys and geophysical investigations were performed. The research program is still in progress and only preliminary results may be proposed. The hydrogeological surveys demonstrate the absence of geomorphological evidence of seismic-induced surface fractures generated by the seismic sequence 2016-2017. Consequently, the complete drying of the lake, occurred in summer 2017, was probably due to meteoclimatic reasons and I or to not yet verified variations in the permeability characteristics of the sutficial deposits and/or bedrock affecting the infiltration towards the subsoil, caused by the severe seismic shaking. The low electrical conductivity values of the lake's waters are in accordance with the prevailing origin of the lake's recharge by snow melting and direct rainfall. As concerns the first geophysical surveys in the Pilato Lake area, seismic surveys by surface wave method assessed that the maximum thickness of debris here estimated is about 12.5-14 m. As a whole, the factors responsible for the progressive lowering of the lake level are: i) the water overflow through the Fonte del Lago spring, ii) the evaporation from the lake surface and iii) the drainage through the scarcely permeable glacial deposits towards the Basal Calcareous Aquifer, hosted within the limestone at lower altitude.

However, the distribution, dynamics and succession of the blooms have not been fully studied. To better understand the basic characteristics of Microcystis blooms in Lake Taihu, samples were collected from December 2008 to December 2009. The distribution and dynamics of different Microcystis morphotypes were characterized. Microcystis genotypes were analyzed also by sequencing the clone library of the internal transcribed spacer of the rRNA operon (ITS). The abundance of total Microcystis and the proportion of microcystin-producing subpopulation were estimated by using a quantitative PCR assay. Marked succession in both morphotypes and genotypes of the Microcystis population occurred during the course of the Microcystis bloom. The 2337 ITS sequences were obtained and were revealed to contain 618 Microcystis genotypes, which was the highest Microcystis genetic diversity reported in Lake Taihu. The T1 genotype, which was characterized by strains of Microcystis floc-aquae, was the most dominant genotype during winter and spring around the entire lake and likely acted as the main inoculum for forming blooms the following year. Water temperature periodically affected the succession of both Microcystis genotypes and morphotypes, whereas the micro environment influenced the spatial distribution of Microcystis genotypes and morphotypes. High ratios of mcyD containing Microcystis subpopulations were detected during the onset and later bloom phases. A redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that the water temperature and PO4-P were the major factors controlling both the total Microcystis abundance and the proportion of microcystin-producing Microcystis in hyper-eutrophic waters.

If such a lake is isolated, the fish assemblage consists of only oxygen-tolerant species without predatory species. Here, our main aim was to analyze the fate of 99 marked pike (Esox lucius) stocked to a pikeless lake that is known to have low oxygen concentrations under ice cover. These pike (total lengths 33.5-76.9 cm; weights 260-3050 g) were stocked in May 2008 and were followed 7years. The first marked pike was caught in August 2008 and the last one in September 2012. Between these dates, 21 pike were caught at least once, five pike were caught twice, and two pike were caught three times. Relative condition was based on the length-weight relationship. Both length and weight affected significantly the recapture probability, whereas relative condition had no effect. The growth of marked pike was estimated based on length or weight increments in two separate models with either starting length or weight together with the number of days between observations. In these models, the number of days had positive, and size, either length or weight, had a negative relationship with growth. According to marginal r(2), length and the number of days explained 65.5% of variation in length increments, whereas the marginal r(2) for weight and the number of days was 49.3% for weight increments. The length increment model was used to compare pike growth in Lake Savijarvi with other Finnish lakes. The comparison showed that during the first four growing seasons after stocking, the pike growth in Lake Savijarvi was faster than in the other lakes studied.

We evaluated trends in the cloudiness, solar radiation, wind, air and water temperatures, ice cover, thermocline depth, transparency, and composition of two Bohemian Forest lakes (Czech Republic) from 1998 to 2022. Lake water temperatures increased by 0.32-0.47 degrees C decade(-1), and the ice cover periods decreased by 11.7-14.8 days decade(-1). These changes were mostly associated with increasing air temperatures during most months and increasing solar radiation (due to decreasing cloudiness) especially in March and November (the months preceding ice-on/off). Decreasing snow cover in winter (by 3.8 cm decade(-1)) further accelerated the earlier ice melt. The number of days with water temperature >= 4 degrees C increased similarly in both lakes by 12-13 days decade(-1). However, the number of days with water temperature >= 20 degrees C increased and the depth of the summer thermocline decreased more in the lake with tree dieback in its catchment. Tree dieback accelerated the leaching of organic carbon and phosphorus, increasing water brownification, algal production, and decreasing water transparency. Solar radiation was absorbed in shallower water layers. Changes in catchment forest thus contributed to the variability in the response of lake water temperatures to climate change.

In the Amazon, floodplain lake hydrodynamics change considerably along the four seasons of the hydrological cycle (rising water, high water, falling water and low water), which can influence Hg bioaccumulation in fish. The main aim of this study was to evaluate if Hg biomagnification is influenced by seasonality in a floodplain lake (Puruzinho Lake) in the Brazilian Amazon. Additionally, the influence of food chain modeling on measurement of Hg biomagnification was tested. Hg concentrations and stable isotope signatures (carbon and nitrogen) were estimated in four species, Mylossoma duriventre (herbivorous), Prochilodus nigricans (detritivorous), Cichla pleiozona (piscivorous) and Serrasalmus rhombeus (piscivorous). The "trophic magnification slope" (TMS) of the food chain composed by the four species was calculated and compared among the four seasons. There was no significant seasonal variation in TMS among rising water, high water, falling water and low water seasons (p = 0.08), suggesting that Hg biomagnification does not change seasonally. However, there was significant variation in TMS among different food chain models. Lower TMS was observed in a food chain composed of detritivorous and piscivorous fish (0.20) in comparison with a food chain composed of the four species (0.26). The results indicate food chain modeling influences TMS results.					; Bastos, Wanderley/AAQ-5875-2020; Pestana, Inacio/S-1043-2018; Pestana, Inácio/S-1043-2018; Azevedo, Lucas/ABC-9221-2020	Azevedo, Lucas/0000-0001-9999-9923; Pestana, Inacio/0000-0002-8263-0078; Rodrigues Bastos, Wanderley/0000-0002-2105-9947; 													0147-6513	1090-2414				JAN 1	2021	207								111249	10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111249	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111249								32890953					WOS:000592463500006

We evaluated the relationships among select ed soil P availability indices and runoff P fractions where manure, whey, or commercial fertilizer applications had previously established a range of soil P availabilities on a Portneuf silt loam (coarse silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Durinodic Xeric Haplocalcid) surface-irrigated with Snake River water. Water-soluble P, Olsen P (inorganic and organic P), and iron-oxide impregnated paper-extractable P (FeO-P-s) were determined on a 0.03-m soil sample taken from the bottom of each furrow before each irrigation in fall 1998 and spring 1999. Dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) in a 0.45-mum filtered runoff sample, and iron-oxide impregnated paper-extractable P (FeO-P-w), total P, and sediment in an unfiltered runoff sample were determined at selected intervals during a 4-h irrigation on 18.3-m field plots. The 1998 and 1999 data sets were combined because there were no significant differences. Flow-weighted average runoff DRP and FeO-P-w concentrations increased linearly as all three soil P test concentrations increased. The average runoff total P concentration was not related to any soil P test but was linearly related to sediment concentration. Stepwise regression selected the independent variables of sediment, soil lime concentration, and soil organic P extracted by the Olsen method as related to average runoff total P concentration. The average runoff total P concentration was 1.08 mg L-1 at a soil Olsen P concentration of 10 mg kg(-1).

Effect of increasing temperature on periphyton accrual under controlled environmental conditions	LIMNOLOGY												Global warming can affect biomass accumulation and the dynamics of periphytic communities, potentially altering their role in aquatic ecosystem functioning. We conducted a 38-day mesocosm experiment to investigate the effects of an increase in winter temperature on periphyton biomass accumulation under eutrophic conditions. We evaluated the warming effect on colonization phases, identifying the most affected phase. The experiment had two treatments (control: current winter temperature of 23.5 celcius, warming: + 5.7 celcius under IPCC scenario). It was carried out in growth chambers under controlled temperature, light, and humidity. Periphyton and water samplings were performed on days 3, 6, 9, 13, 17, 21, 27, and 38. The increase in temperature did not affect the organic matter accrual rate of the periphyton. However, it negatively affected the net and gross accrual rate of the algal biomass. Ash-free dry mass and chlorophyll-a ratio in the periphyton increased at higher temperatures, indicating a decrease in autotrophic components in the periphyton in the warming treatment. We detected losses in algal biomass during the intermediate and advanced colonization phases. Our results showed a decrease in periphytic algal biomass with an increase in average temperature in winter. In conclusion, a warming scenario can negatively influence periphyton biomass in eutrophic ecosystems, where algal growth in the community is generally unfavorable.

The results suggest that a higher lake level and relatively lower terrestrial vegetation cover occurred synchronously during the early Holocene (11.3-8.6 kyr cal BP), compared with the period from 8.6 to 6.9 kyr cal BP. This finding clearly reflects the existence of different hydroclimatic conditions between the lake and its catchment due to diverse driving mechanisms. The early Holocene high stand of the lake, as demonstrated by the stratigraphic variability of the remains of aquatic biota, may have responded to the strengthened ASM and increased monsoonal precipitation; the relatively low vegetation cover in the marginal region of the Asian monsoon during the early Holocene, and the coeval widespread active sand dune mobility in both the NE Tibetan Plateau and NE China, most likely resulted from a low level of effective moisture due to high evaporation, and hence they cannot be interpreted as evidence of a weak ASM. Our results potentially reconcile the current divergent interpretations of various proxy climate records from the region. Our findings suggest that the ASM evolution was characterized by a consistent pattern across the monsoonal regions, as indicated by the oxygen isotope record of Chinese speleothems.					li, yuan/GZH-3511-2022; Qiang, Mingrui/JXW-8925-2024; Weckstrom, Jan/N-7665-2013; Weckström, Jan/N-7665-2013	Weckstrom, Jan/0000-0001-5604-617X; Huang, Xiaozhong/0000-0002-2127-0451; Li, Yuan/0000-0002-7110-9180													0341-8162	1872-6887				APR	2021	199								105089	10.1016/j.catena.2020.105089	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2020.105089													WOS:000608022600009

Age, Growth, and Fall Diet of Channel Catfish in Cheat Lake, West Virginia	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Acidification has historically impaired Cheat Lake's fish community, but recent mitigation efforts within the Cheat River watershed have improved water quality and species richness. Presently, channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus are abundant and attain desirable sizes for anglers. We evaluated the age, growth, and fall diet of the population. We collected a sample of 155 channel catfish from Cheat Lake from 5 August to 4 December 2014, a subset of which we aged (n = 148) using lapillus otoliths. We fit four growth models (von Bertalanffy, logistic, Gompertz, and power) to length-at-age data and compared models using an information theoretic approach. We collected fall diets from 55 fish sampled from 13 October to 4 December 2014. Total lengths of individuals in the sample ranged from 154 to 721 mm and ages ranged from 2 to 19 y. We AIC(c)-selected the von Bertalanffy growth model as the best approximating model, and the power and Gompertz models also had considerable support. Diets were numerically dominated by Diptera larvae, specifically Chironomidae and Chaoboridae, while 39% of stomachs contained terrestrial food items. This study provides baseline data for management of Cheat Lake's channel catfish population. Further, this study fills a knowledge gap in the scientific literature on channel catfish, because few previously published studies have examined the population ecology of channel catfish in the Central Appalachian region.

J	Zeng, DW; Yuan, X				Zeng, Dingwen; Yuan, Xing			Modeling the Influence of Upstream Land-Atmosphere Coupling on the 2017 Persistent Drought over Northeast China	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Persistent drought events that cause serious damage to the economy and environment are usually intensified by the feedback between the land surface and atmosphere. Therefore, reasonably modeling land-atmosphere coupling is critical for skillful prediction of persistent droughts. However, most high-resolution regional climate modeling has focused on the amplification effect of land-atmosphere coupling on local anticyclonic circulation anomalies, while less attention has been paid to the nonlocal influence through altering large-scale atmospheric circulation. Here we investigate how the antecedent land-atmosphere coupling over the area south of Lake Baikal (ASLB) influences the drought events occurring over its downstream region [i.e., Northeast China (NEC)] by using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model and a linear baroclinic model (LBM). When the ASLB region is artificially forced to be wet in the WRF simulations during March-May, the surface sensible heating is weakened and results in a cooling anomaly in low level atmosphere during May-July. Consequently, the anticyclonic circulation anomalies over ASLB and NEC are weakened, and the severity of NEC drought during May-July cannot be captured due to the upstream wetting in March-May. In the LBM experiments, idealized atmospheric heating anomaly that mimics the diabatic heating associated with surface wetness is imposed over ASLB, and the quasi-steady response pattern of 500-hPa geopotential height to the upstream wetting is highly consistent with that in the WRF simulation. In addition, the lower-level heating instead of the upper-level cooling makes a major contribution to the high pressure anomaly over NEC. This study implies the critical role of modeling upstream land-atmosphere coupling in capturing downstream persistent droughts.

Large pseudo-single-domain (PSD) to multi domain (MD) detrital magnetite grains are identified in the lake samples. The upwards decreasing magnetic susceptibility (chi) and anhysteretic remanent magnetic susceptibility (chi(ARM)) are consistent with the dominant vegetation changes: grassland (similar to 13.0-10.5 ka) under dry and cold conditions, shrub-forest-grassland (similar to 10.5-5.8 ka) in a warm and humid climate, and forest where the Pinus trees increase rapidly to be the dominant taxa, indicating the climate changes from warm and humid to cooler but drier between similar to 5.8 ka and similar to 4.0 ka. The lower S-100mT and S-300mT ratios coincide with the higher degree of soil stability and a stable lake stage at similar to 11.8-6.5 ka. Changes in magnetic anisotropy are also linked to environmental and climatic changes, with T parameters showing higher values during warm/interglacial periods. The anisotropy patterns indicate three different stages of the lake evolution: (1) an early stage of the lake, accompanied by a disturbed high-energy flow, a coarse average mineral particle diameter (MPD) distribution (> 16.28 mu m) and scattered sub vertical minimum direction (K-3 at similar to 13M-11.8 ka; (2) a fairly stable lake environment between similar to 11.8 ka and 6.5 ka, indicated by a low-energy flow, finer MPD (similar to 9.69 mu m) and subvertical K-3 axes; (3) an unstable, high-energy flow and coarse MPD (similar to 20.03 mu m) with tilted K-3 axes, thus indicating a transition from lake-center to lakeside (similar to 6.5-4.0 ka). These multi-proxy records reveal a weak EASM activity in the final period of the last deglaciation (similar to 13.0-11.8 ka), a high EASM intensity in the early-mid Holocene (similar to 11.8-4.8 ka), an EASM maxima in the mid-Holocene (similar to 8.0-5.8 ka), which then generally weakens at similar to 4.3-4.2 ka. Overall, this study suggests the anisotropy and climatic changes in the alpine lake are significantly affected by the insolation-driven EASM.

Quantifying morphological and genetic variation of sympatric populations to guide conservation of endangered, micro-endemic springsnails	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. The endangered snails Juturnia kosteri and Pyrgulopsis roswellensis are endemic to springs on Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge, NM, USA. These species are small and difficult to distinguish by shell shape. 2. A morphological analysis of these two species was conducted using geometric morphometrics, and a phylogenetic analysis using the mitochondrial DNA genes COI and ND1 was performed. 3. Principal component analysis showed significant overlap in shell shape between the two species. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the two species formed monophyletic clades, with each containing low genetic diversity. Analysis of molecular variance for each species showed significant variation among populations. Both species showed significant isolation-by-distance, but only P. roswellensis showed a significant relationship between shell shape and geographic distance. 4. The overlapping ranges and the similarity in shell morphology suggest that these micro-endemic species are difficult to distinguish in the field, particularly by non-specialists. This presents challenges to population management of these species. 5. Divergence among populations within each species indicates isolation at very small geographic scales. Because these desert springs are home to endemic species within a variety of invertebrate groups, they are likely to contain significant amounts of yet-to-be-discovered biodiversity; many of these unknown taxa are also likely to be of conservation concern.

Fifteen urban eutrophic lakes with different nutrients concentrations were sampled on a bimonthly basis for two years. In total, the absolutely dominance of colonial cyanobacteria in summer occurred with the relative low TN:TP ratios, and relative higher TN:TP ratio was observed when the unicellular algae dominated the community in winter. The relationships between phytoplankton density and nutrients were analyzed using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression analysis (RA), which attributed the dominant of colonial species to the high concentration of phosphorus (P) and the lower TN:TP ratios. The results of ANOVA demonstrated that the chlorophyll a (Chl-a) had a significant positive correlation with TP when the concentration of TP less than 500mg/m(3), and increased smoothly when TP greater than 500mg/m(3). The regression analysis between colonial cyanobacteria and TN:TP showed a negative correlation when the TN:TP less than 22 and reversed to positive when it exceed 22. Since the verity of above, we concluded that the TN:TP ratios and TP play similarly efficient role in regulating the colonial cyanobacteria densities.																			2151-7614		978-1-4244-4713-8				2010																								WOS:000397260205083

Here we present lake geomorphologic and lithological evidence from the Alashan Plateau, part of the Mongolian Plateau, that indicates strong lake desiccation during the mid-Holocene. High resolution pollen data from Zhuyeze Lake, at the present summer monsoon margin, is also presented. These data show that present lakes and wetlands in the Juyanze Lake basin west of the Badain Jaran desert, in the Zhuyeze Lake basin between the Badain Jaran and Tengger deserts, and in lakes in the eastern Tengger desert, dried or experienced low lake levels in the mid-Holocene around 5000-7000 cal yr BP. Pollen data further indicate that the vegetation cover declined in both the local areas and in the Qilian Mountains, suggesting the climate was drier than that associated with the present Asian summer monsoon. This mid-Holocene drought interval was present throughout a quite large region of the south Inner Mongolian Plateau. The period was also probably colder, at least in the high Asian plateaus and mountains.					; Fahu, Chen/B-2788-2011	Chen, Fahu/0000-0002-8874-1035; 													1001-6538	1861-9541				JUL	2003	48	14					1401	1410		10.1360/03wd0245	http://dx.doi.org/10.1360/03wd0245													WOS:000184463300002

We report seasonal to monthly resolution Sr/Ca and delta(18)O data for five Holocene and one modem Porites corals, each covering a growth history of 9-13 years. The results reveal a general decreasing trend in sea surface temperature (SST) in the SCS from similar to 6800 to 1500 years ago, despite shorter climatic cycles. Compared with the mean Sr/Ca-SST in the 1990s (24.8 degrees C), 10-year mean Sr/Ca-SSTs were 0.9-0.5 degrees C higher between 6.8 and 5.0 thousand years before present (ky BP), dropped to the present level by similar to 2.5 ky BP, and reached a low of 22.6 degrees C (2.2 degrees C lower) by similar to 1.5 ky BP. The summer Sr/Ca-SST maxima, which are more reliable due to faster summer-time growth rates and higher sampling resolution, follow the same trend, i.e. being 1-2 degrees C higher between 6.8 and 5.0 ky BP, dropping to the present level by -2.5 ky BP, and reaching a low of 28.7 degrees C (0.7 degrees C lower) by similar to 1.5 ky BP. Such a decline in SST is accompanied by a similar decrease in the amount of monsoon moisture transported out of South China Sea, resulting in a general decrease in the seawater delta(18)O values, reflected by offsets of mean 6 180 relative to that in the 1990s. This observation is consistent with general weakening of the East Asian summer monsoon since early Holocene, in response to a continuous decline in solar radiation, which was also found in pollen, lake-level and loess/paleosol records throughout Mainland China. The climatic conditions similar to 2.5 and similar to 1.5 ky ago were also recorded in Chinese history. In contrast with the general cooling trend of the monsoon climate in East Asia, SST increased dramatically in recent time, with that in the 1990s being 2.2 degrees C warmer than that similar to 1.5 ky ago. This clearly indicates that the increase in the concentration of anthropogenic greenhouse gases played a dominant role in recent global warming, which reversed the natural climatic trend in East Asian monsoon regime.

Changes in weather persistence: Insight from Inuit knowledge	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS												Since the 1990s, local residents from around the Arctic have reported changes in weather predictability. Examination of environmental measurements have not, until now, helped describe what the local inhabitants have been reporting, in part because prior studies did not focus directly on the persistence aspect of weather. Here we show that there is evidence of changes in persistence in weather over the last two decades for Baker Lake, Nunavut, Canada. Hourly data indicate that for local spring, the persistence of temperature has changed dramatically in the last 15 years with some years showing a strong drop in day-to-day persistence in the local spring afternoons, somewhat at odds with changes in persistence on a more global scale. Changes in daily persistence may have implications for human health, agriculture, and ecosystems worldwide. More importantly, the approach of merging indigenous knowledge with scientific methods may offer unexpected benefits for both. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the situation regarding the breeding populations of Goosanders Mergus merganser merganser in Europe appears to be paradoxical: in many places, an increase in the breeding population and range extension have been documented. We studied the breeding biology of this species during the breeding seasons of 1987-1996. We show that the breeding success of a Goosander population breeding in Northern Poland was higher following winters when the ice cover disappeared earlier. There was a significant positive relationship between the disappearance of ice cover and the clutch initiation date, and the breeding success of early broods was higher. The overall mean clutch initiation date was 13 April +/- 15 days (SD). The yearly means of clutch initiation dates varied from the beginning of April to the beginning of May. It seems likely that, among other factors, the Goosander's adaptability in terms of the timing of breeding may be partially responsible for the expansion of the species into new areas in the last 30 years.

Within the U.S., this species breeds almost entirely within the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, nearly all of which is Open, or proposed to be opened, for oil development. Rigorous estimates of Yellow-billed Loon population size and trend are lacking but essential for informed conservation. We used two annual aerial waterfowl surveys, conducted 1986-2003 and 1992-2003, to estimate population size and trend on northern Alaskan breeding grounds. In estimating population trend, we used mixed-effects regression models to reduce bias and sampling error associated with improvement in observer skill and annual effects of spring phenology. The estimated population trend on Alaskan breeding grounds since 1986 was near 0 with an estimated annual change of-0.9% (95% CI of-3.6% to +1.8%). The estimated population size, averaged over the past 12 years and adjusted by a correction factor based on an intensive, lake-circling, aerial survey method, was 2221 individuals (95% CI of 1206-3235) in early June and 3369 individuals (95% CI of 1910-4828) in late June. Based on estimates from other studies of the proportion of loons nesting in a given year, it is likely that < 1000 nesting pairs inhabit northern Alaska in most years. The highest concentration of Yellow-billed Loons occurred between the Meade and Ikpikpuk Rivers; and across all of northern Alaska, 53% of recorded sightings occurred within 12% of the area.																				1938-5129				MAY	2005	107	2					289	304		10.1650/7717	http://dx.doi.org/10.1650/7717													WOS:000229135800009

Thermal bar progression rates were compared with two analytical models; both produced overestimates during the early part of the thermal bar and underestimates during the late spring. In a zone between the shore and the thermal bar, currents were influenced by the local wind stress and flowed in a counter-clockwise direction. The mean cross-shore flows in the nearshore zone were reduced during the thermal bar period. The alongshore horizontal exchange coefficients were higher than cross-shore exchange coefficients. During the thermal bar period, the magnitude of both alongshore and cross-shore exchange coefficients decreased when the bar was still within middepth (<40 m); when it was further offshore, the thermal bar did not have any significant effect on alongshore exchange coefficients, but cross-shore exchanges decreased marginally. The vertical exchange coefficients were high in the water column because of convective mixing during the thermal bar period. During the evolution of spring thermal bar, the vertical mixing decreased considerably in the nearshore regions under stable stratification, whereas the high vertical mixing levels continued in the offshore region for a longer period.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2004	49	6					2190	2200		10.4319/lo.2004.49.6.2190	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2004.49.6.2190													WOS:000225137100027

For this purpose, the UCLA Surface Meteorology and Ozone Generation (SMOG) air pollution modeling system has been used to simulate the geographical distributions of trace metals and their deposition fluxes. Calculations were performed for average summer and winter conditions, as well as for extreme meteorological events, in particular, for Santa Ana winds. Thus, a series of simulations were carried out that define the range of meteorological conditions contributing to dry deposition in the region. These predictions have been calibrated and validated using measurements collected in the LA area. Significant spatial and temporal variability are found in trace metal concentrations and deposition rates. Large spatial gradients occur near the coast as well as at the mountainous boundaries of the airshed. Considerable diurnal and seasonal variations in trace metal deposition are also noted. For example, the development of a daytime sea breeze, particularly in the warmer months, leads to greater deposition in the northern and eastern basin as well as in the high desert. A nighttime land breeze, especially in the colder months, enhances deposition onto coastal ocean surfaces. Large particles dominate local trace metal deposition in central urban ( and adjacent) areas, while fine particles export metals over regional scales through long-range advection. Since the majority of urban metal deposition occurs on particles larger than 10-mum diameter, routine measurements of PM10 or PM2.5 concentrations for air quality characterization may not be reliable indicators of local sources. Some 35-45% of all trace metal emissions are deposited locally within the Los Angeles Basin on an annual basis. Santa Monica Bay and its watersheds receive about 6% of this amount, which can have a significant impact on trace metal concentrations in the surface waters of the bay, primarily through land runoff following storms.																			2169-897X	2169-8996				JAN 31	2003	108	D2							4074	10.1029/2001JD001446	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2001JD001446													WOS:000182897200008

Thus, the dataset is divided into two subperiods, 1961-1985 (P1) and 1986-2010 (P2), which are denoted as the wet period and dry period, respectively. The possible mechanisms accounting for the wet-to-dry shift in the APSB are investigated using both observational data and a baroclinic atmospheric model. Analysis shows that the sea surface temperature (SST) in the tropical Indian-western Pacific (TIWP) regions displays continuous warming during the period under examination, which may intensify the ascent motion over the warm pool and favor the descent motion over the Sichuan Basin. Meanwhile, the Gill-type atmospheric response to anomalous TIWP warm SST is accompanied by anomalous northerly winds prevailing over central and Southwest China. Both the intensified descent motion and anomalous northerly winds over central and Southwest China favor the switch to dry conditions in the APSB. Further analysis shows that the decadal changes in the North Atlantic SST lead to an atmospheric wave pattern prevailing over the extratropical Eurasian continent. An anomalous cyclone over central-eastern Eurasia, which is one component of the wave pattern, is accompanied by significant northerly winds penetrating southward to central China. These northerly winds can cause more-than-normal snow cover around Lake Baikal, which may in turn modulate the atmospheric circulation through positive feedback and therefore result in intensified northerly winds, favorable for the switch to the anomalous dry state of the APSB.

However, high-resolution lake records from the mid-to late-Holocene have not been determined for the Central Tibetan Plateau, which is in the transition zone between the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) system and the westerlies. In this study, we analyzed the distribution and compound-specific carbon isotope compositions (delta C-13) of sedimentary n-alkanes and the bulk sediment total organic matter (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and C/N ratios to reconstruct the paleoenvironmental changes over the past 6 cal. ka BP using a 376-cm sediment core from the southern basin of Tangra Yumco, Central Tibetan Plateau. Our results indicated that clear stepwise decreases in lake productivity and lake level occurred during the mid-to late-Holocene based on decreases in delta C-13 values of mid-chain n-alkanes and Paq (an n-alkane-based proxy). Additionally, the variations in the TOC, TN, and C/N ratios revealed generally increased inputs of allochthonous organic matter over the past 6 cal. ka BP. When our findings at Tangra Yumco were compared with records from the Central Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions, we found generally consistent patterns of lake environmental changes over the past 6 cal. ka BP, suggesting that the climate of the Central Tibetan Plateau was primarily influenced by the ISM system at the millennial time scale. Therefore, our results depict the evolution of the ISM over the past 6 cal. ka BP in the Central Tibetan Plateau, which corresponds to summer solar insolation and the migrations of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). We also propose that the climate of the North Atlantics influenced the climate of the Central Tibetan Plateau through some indirect climatic mechanisms.					; Peng, Ping'an/KOC-4726-2024; Zhu, Liping/AAC-4284-2022; Wang, Junbo/IVH-8446-2023	Zhu, Liping/0000-0002-4234-8748; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				OCT	2017	27	10					1475	1486		10.1177/0959683617693893	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683617693893													WOS:000412720200005

Foraging behavior of Red-necked (Phalaropus lobatus) and Wilson's (P tricolor) phalaropes on Great Salt Lake, Utah	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												Great Salt Lake (GSL) is a critical staging area for 2 species of phalaropes: Wilson's (Phalaropus tricolor) and Red-necked (P lobatus). Both rely on the abundant invertebrate prey at GSL to fuel their fall migrations to Central and South America, but little is known about where phalaropes forage on GSL, what foraging methods are used, or what variables influence their foraging decisions. During 2014 and 2015, the frequency of specific foraging behaviors by phalaropes differed by GSI, bays; surface picking was the most common foraging behavior (>= 50%) on Carrington and Gilbert bays while spinning was the most common on Farmington Bay. Most (60%) Red-necked Phalaropes used surface picking for foraging compared to 32% of Wilson's Phalaropes. Spinning behavior to upwell prey was more common in Wilson's Phalaropes (used by 19% of foraging birds) than Red-necked Phalaropes (3%). The proportion of phalaropes in a flock that were foraging was positively associated with biomass of invertebrate prey at the flock's location. Most (64%) of the phalarope flocks were on Farmington Bay, and 75% of phalaropes in this bay were foraging, compared to 41% of birds on Gilbert Bay. Thus, Farmington Bay is particularly important for hundreds of thousands of Red-necked and Wilson's phalaropes that stage on GSL for 4 months during each summer. Farmington Ray is brackish, shallow, and depends on the Jordan River for its freshwater. The future of this water source, and therefore Farmington Bay itself. is uncertain because of future diversions by humans and longer droughts predicted from climate change.

BP). The chronology of the sequence is constrained by varve counting and AMS C-14 measurement of terrestrial plant macrofossils. Multiproxy analyses (magnetic susceptibility, grain size, TOC, TN, TS, Rock Eval, pollen and macrofossils) imply that cold and dry regional climatic conditions with sparse Arctic vegetation prevailed prior to 11500 cal. BP. Coincident with the transition to the Holocene at 11500 cal. BP, air temperatures and lake productivity increased and Betula pubescens and Populus tremula started to migrate into the area, followed by Picea abies at 10750 cal. BP. Although lake productivity decreased at around 11000 cal. BP and remained low until 9600 cal. BP, pollen-based climate reconstructions imply variable climatic conditions in the region over time. Drier and colder summers prevailed from similar to11200 to 10900 cal. BP, followed by an interval of higher annual temperatures and precipitation from 10900 to 10750 cal. BP. Lower annual temperatures and drier conditions existed from 10750 to 10200 cal. BP, and higher temperatures and precipitation are inferred between 10200 and 10000 cal. BP. Finally, declining temperatures and precipitation occurred from 10000 cal. BP onwards, with a minimum at around 9600 cal. BP. These climatic shifts are temporally coincident with those recorded in North Atlantic terrestrial, marine and ice-core archives and indicate that relatively minor climate signals were transmitted further to the east.					; Bennike, Ole/G-7070-2018; Tarasov, Pavel/ABG-3993-2020; filimonova, ludmila/U-1738-2019; Schwark, Lorenz/AAF-1902-2021	Schwark, Lorenz/0000-0003-0683-0817; Bennike, Ole/0000-0002-5486-9946; /0000-0002-7219-5009													0959-6836	1477-0911				SEP	2004	14	5					732	746		10.1191/0959683604hl751rp	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683604hl751rp													WOS:000223638700009

Research on flooding dynamics in tropical floodplains has revealed a substantial impact on plankton community structure. Our field study focused on the Curuai floodplain, a tropical system within the Amazon Basin in northern Brazil. We conducted parallel transects sampling across seven lakes of the floodplain during both rising and falling water periods. The objective is to quantify carbon biomass partition among bacterioplankton, phytoplankton, and zooplankton and to understand how hydrological changes influence plankton communities and their interactions. Phytoplankton accounted for the largest fraction of the plankton carbon (> 70%), followed by zooplankton (approximate to 16%), with bacteria contributing the least to the total carbon pool (< 10%). Hydrological variations significantly altered the structure and interactions of plankton communities. During the rising water period, increased water transparency led to higher amounts of bacteria, cryptophytes, and a greater contribution of cladocerans to the zooplankton carbon stock. The greater crustacean zooplankton biomass during the flood coincided with a lower phytoplankton biomass, including cyanobacteria. Bacterial production seemed to sustain a microbial loop that was relatively independent from the classical food web, and microorganisms were likely a carbon sink during the rising water. The falling water period was marked by a more productive environment, characterized by higher nutrient levels (total nitrogen: 240.0-700.0 <mu>g L-1), organic carbon (0.7-12.0 mg L-1), and temperatures (29.9-34.9 degrees C), which influenced community structure and plankton interactions. Rotifers experienced a significant biomass increase, ranging from 103.4 mu g C L-1 during the rising water period to 290.0 mu g C L-1 during the falling water period, and the biomass ratio between rotifers and bacteria rose from 0.5 to 5.4, on average. Copepods also exerted a greater impact on bacterioplankton during this period. Cyanobacteria's relative contribution doubled during the falling water period, constituting, on average, 42% of the phytoplankton carbon biomass and predominantly consisting of potentially toxic species. This likely disrupted the phytoplankton-zooplankton relationships, and the high primary productivity most likely flowed mainly through microbial pathways in the studied Amazonian floodplain system.

Olympic legacy can be defined as positive impacts on the hosting city and its people, lasting for a long time. Since the beginning of the 20s Olympic legacy became an Olympic demand for hosting the games. One of the social impacts has an educational aspect of reusing the Olympic sport facilities. The assumption is that construction of new sport facilities and reusing the Olympic sport facilities after the Games can bring significant increase in the sport activity of the people that will utilize the improved conditions. The educational idea of physical activity as a life style that can promote quality of life and helps in improving mental and physical health, point to the importance of the public reuse of Olympic sport facilities after the Games. The aim of this paper was to analyse the educational issue of public reuse of Olympic sport facilities after the Games in four hosting cities, two cities hosting summer Games (Athens 2004, London 2012), and two cities hosting winter Games (Salt Lake City 2002, Vancouver 2010). In order to achieve its purpose, a qualitative approach (four cases) was used in this paper. Results and comparison of the four cases were discussed, while examining the factors influencing the public reuse of Olympic sport facilities.

J	Klug, C; Cashman, KV; Bacon, CR				Klug, C; Cashman, KV; Bacon, CR			Structure and physical characteristics of pumice from the climactic eruption of Mount Mazama (Crater Lake), Oregon	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												The vesicularity, permeability, and structure of pumice clasts provide insight into conditions of vesiculation and fragmentation during Plinian fall and pyroclastic flow-producing phases of the similar to7,700 cal. year B.P. Climactic eruption of Mount Mazama (Crater Lake), Oregon. We show that bulk properties (vesicularity and permeability) can be correlated with internal textures and that the clast structure can be related to inferred changes in eruption conditions. The vesicularity of all pumice clasts is 75-88%, with >90% interconnected pore volume. However, pumice clasts from the Plinian fall deposits exhibit a wider vesicularity range and higher volume percentage of interconnected vesicles than do clasts from pyroclastic-flow deposits. Pumice permeabilities also differ between the two clast types, with pumice from the fall deposit having higher minimum permeabilities (similar to5x10(-13) m(2)) and a narrower permeability range (5-50x10(-13) m(2)) than clasts from pyroclastic-flow deposits (0.2-330x10(-13) m(2)). The observed permeability can be modeled to estimate average vesicle aperture radii of 1-5 mum for the fall deposit clasts and 0.25-1 mum for clasts from the pyroclastic flows. High vesicle number densities (similar to10(9) cm(-3)) in all clasts suggest that bubble nucleation occurred rapidly and at high supersaturations. Post-nucleation modifications to bubble populations include both bubble growth and coalescence. A single stage of bubble nucleation and growth can account for 35-60% of the vesicle population in clasts from the fall deposits, and 65-80% in pumice from pyroclastic flows. Large vesicles form a separate population which defines a power law distribution with fractal dimension D=3.3 (range 3.0-3.5). The large D value, coupled with textural evidence, suggests that the large vesicles formed primarily by coalescence. When viewed together, the bulk properties (vesicularity, permeability) and textural characteristics of all clasts indicate rapid bubble nucleation followed by bubble growth, coalescence and permeability development. This sequence of events is best explained by nucleation in response to a downward-propagating decompression wave, followed by rapid bubble growth and coalescence prior to magma disruption by fragmentation. The heterogeneity of vesicle sizes and shapes, and the absence of differential expansion across individual clasts, suggest that post-fragmentation expansion played a limited role in the development of pumice structure. The higher vesicle number densities and lower permeabilities of pyroclastic-flow clasts indicate limited coalescence and suggest that fragmentation occurred shortly after decompression. Either increased eruption velocities or increased depth of fragmentation accompanying caldera collapse could explain compression of the pre-fragmentation vesiculation interval.																			0258-8900					OCT	2002	64	7					486	501		10.1007/s00445-002-0230-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00445-002-0230-5													WOS:000178982200004

Estimation of paddlefish (Polyodon spathula Walbaum, 1792) spawning habitat availability with consumer-grade sonar	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY					5th Annual Meeting of the North-American-Sturgeon-and-Paddlefish-Society (NASPS)	SEP 19-22, 2016	Hood River, OR	N Amer Sturgeon & Paddlefish Soc				The paddlefish (Polyodon spathula Walbaum, 1792) is a springtime migrant that requires discrete abiotic conditions such as water temperature, discharge, and substrate composition for successful spawning and recruitment. Although population declines have prevailed throughout much of the species range, Oklahoma paddlefish are abundant and support popular recreational snag fisheries - most notably in Grand Lake. This stock utilizes the Grand Lake's two primary headwaters, the Neosho and Spring rivers, with only episodic recruitment success. However, relationships between suitable spawning habitat and water level have not been evaluated in this system. Using consumer-grade sonar equipment, this study identified and quantified hard river substrates (such as cobble and bedrock) and investigated proportional habitat availability at a variety of simulated river conditions. Sonar data were used to construct 49-m(2) grids of depth and bottom hardness (H) ranging from 0.0 (soft) - 0.5 (hard). Ground-truthing samples of bottom composition were collected with a grab sampler and by visual identification. Substrate types were pooled into two categories: soft substrates (H < 0.386) and spawning substrates (H >= 0.386) allowing for estimation of available spawning habitat in each river. Spawning habitat comprised 69% of total available habitat for the Neosho River (6.5 ha/km) and 58% for the Spring River (7.9 ha/km). Estimated spawning habitat was simulated over a range of river stages and predictive models were developed to estimate proportional spawning habitat availability (PHA). Although the Spring River contains more concentrated spawning habitat in closer proximity to Grand Lake, the Neosho River contains a greater quantity over nearly twice the distance to the first migration barrier, has a larger watershed, and demonstrates greater PHA at lower river stages. Model results were validated in context of known high and low recruitment years, where a greater frequency and duration of days with >= 90% PHA were observed in good recruitment years, particularly in the Neosho River. In total, results suggest the Neosho River has greater value for paddlefish reproduction than the Spring River. Research-informed harvest management will remain critical to the conservation of wild-recruiting stocks for continued recreational use in Oklahoma.

J	Li, YX; Dong, X; Hu, CM				Li, Yuxin; Dong, Xi; Hu, Chunming			The impact of ecological water level on wintering migratory birds in Poyang Lake - Focusing on phytophagous geese	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China and a globally important wintering habitat for migratory birds. The ecosystem health of Poyang Lake and the surrounding lakeshore wetlands is crucial for the wintering of birds. To better protect the health of bird wintering habitats, this study proposes an ecological water level calculation method that comprehensively considers zoning and phasing by establishing a coupled relationship between water level and ecosystem health. The results show that the ecosystem characteristics of the Poyang Lake lakeshore wetland are closely related to the water level. Based on the water level guarantee rate, the lake area can be divided into five sub-areas: 0%, 0-25%, 25-50%, 50-75%, and 75-100%, each with significant differences in vegetation characteristics. The average water levels in February, June, September, and November significantly impact the ecosystem health of the Poyang Lake lakeshore wetland and can serve as regulatory nodes for ecological water levels. Based on the life habits of geese and ducks, which are the dominant migratory bird species in Poyang Lake, the importance of ecological water level regulation is in the order of September, February, November and June, and the ecological water level in each month is recommended to be controlled as follows: the February average water level within the range of 6-8 m, ensure a minimum June average water level of 15 m, maintain the September average water level between 11-12 m, and stabilize the November average water level at 10 m. This thesis proposes a new way of studying the ecological water level of lakes, which can improve the existing research methods of ecological water level and better protect the ecosystem health of lakes and wetlands and fulfill their key ecological services.

J	Gabriel, AO				Gabriel, AO			Impacts, perceptions, and management of shoreline hazards and water levels on a fluctuating reservoir: A case study of the Winnebago System, Wisconsin	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												This paper provides the results of a mail survey of 872 residential property owners along the shorelines of the Winnebago System, Wisconsin that determined their hazard experiences, adjustments, and management preferences in regards to fluctuating water levels. While half of the respondents were aware of hazard potentials prior to purchase, properties have been impacted by a range of shoreline hazards from flooding(27%) to high water levels (54%). Principally caused by a combination of storm-driven waves and high water levels, hazard damages are hazard-specific, and tend to relate to either the shoreline directly (e.g. loss of beach, lawn and garden damage) or to structures directly on the shoreline (e.g. shore protection or docks). Similar to other systems, many residents have resorted to structural hazard adjustments, generally as a response to erosion or high water levels. The majority of property owners indicated a preference for water level regulation to reduce shoreline hazards. However, the majority of respondents also would prefer the water levels to remain the same, while the remaining respondents were extremely divided between the various options for target summer and winter water levels, actually preferring levels that would increase hazard potentials. There is a need for a public education program on the Winnebago System that focuses on publicizing the technical limitations of lake level regulation to reduce hazard losses, the range of alternative hazard adjustment strategies, and the financial and technical assistance for hazard management available from various government agencies.																			1040-2381					SEP	2004	20	3					197	210		10.1080/07438140409354244	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140409354244													WOS:000226614500003
J	Douglas, CL; King, KA; Zuzel, JF				Douglas, CL; King, KA; Zuzel, JF			Nitrogen and phosphorus in surface runoff and sediment from a wheat-pea rotation in northeastern Oregon	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Runoff and erosion from cultivated fields are suggested as major sources of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) entering lakes and streams. Loss of these nutrients can be impacted by soil and crop management practices. There is relatively little information on nutrients leaving agricultural fields in the dryland areas of the Pacific Northwest, especially as impacted by different crops and crop rotations. Nutrients in surface runoff and soil leaving a series of plots in northeast Oregon were evaluated for 5 yr. Objectives were to evaluate the effects of a wheat-pea (Triticum aestivium L.-Pisum sativum L.) rotation on N and P in surface runoff and eroded soil. Cumulative N and P lost in runoff were less than 3 and 0.2 kg ha(-1), respectively. Total N lost from continuous fallow (CP) plots, even though they were never fertilized, ranged from 20 to 100 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). This was much more N than was lost from winter wheat (WW) (5-70 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and spring pea (SP) (25-40 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)), because there was much more sediment loss from CF than from WW or SP plots. The same scenario occurred with P as with N, with loss from CF of 8 to 48 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), WW of 2 to 28 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), and from SP of 8 to 16 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). All fertilizer was surface-applied and 25 to 76% of the fertilizer applied was lost in 5 yr, depending on the time of fertilizer application and the type of crop growing. Nutrient loss from these fields can be controlled by controlling soil erosion.																			0047-2425	1537-2537				SEP-OCT	1998	27	5					1170	1177		10.2134/jeq1998.00472425002700050023x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1998.00472425002700050023x													WOS:000076059600022

In polar deserts, Arctic hares are abundant herbivores and important components of food webs. Their annual migrations have long been suspected, but never confirmed. We tracked 25 individuals with Argos satellite telemetry to investigate the existence of migration in a population living at Alert (Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada). During fall, 21 hares undertook directional, long-distance movements in a southwestern direction towards Lake Hazen. Daily movement rates averaged 1.3 +/- 0.5 km, 4.3 +/- 1.6 km, and 1.7 +/- 0.9 km before, during, and after relocation, respectively. Straight-line and minimum cumulative distances traveled averaged 98 +/- 18 km (range: 72-148 km) and 198 +/- 62 km (range: 113-388 km), respectively. This is the first report of large-scale seasonal movements in Arctic hares and, surprisingly, in any lagomorph species. These movements may be part of an annual migratory pattern. Our results redefine our understanding of the spatial ecology of Arctic hares, demonstrate unsuspected mobility capacities in lagomorphs, and open new perspectives regarding the ecological dynamics of the northern polar deserts.

Richard			African Humid Period Precipitation Sustained by Robust Vegetation, Soil, and Lake Feedbacks	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The African Humid Period (similar to 11,000-5,000 years before present) was the most recent of several precessionally paced wet intervals during which an increase in the Northern Hemisphere summer incoming solar radiation intensifies the West African Monsoon leading to dramatic changes over northern Africa. However, insolation anomaly alone is not sufficient and feedbacks are essential for further amplification of the monsoon. The most significant feedbacks derive from the land surface, arising from changes to vegetation, soil properties, and distribution of surface water. We show that in contrast to previous studies that have explored the individual impacts of these feedbacks, a modern climate model yields a much greater increase in precipitation in response to their collective effect. Agreement with proxies is improved while the desert-steppe transition is pushed further northward than in any previous study. In the West African Sahel, intensities of summer daily mean and extreme precipitation increase by 150% and 90%, respectively.

J	Tanner, LH; Lucas, SG				Tanner, Lawrence H.; Lucas, Spencer G.			Carbonate facies of the Upper Triassic Ojo Huelos Member, San Pedro Arroyo Formation (Chinle Group), southern New Mexico: Paleoclimatic implications	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The Upper Triassic (Adamanian LVF) Ojo Huelos Member of the San Pedro Arroyo Formation (Chinle Group) is a distinctive, carbonate-rich unit that occurs in the lower Chinle section of central New Mexico. The member consists mainly of micritic lime mudstones, ostracodal wackestones to grainstones, peloidal grainstones and distinctive pisolitic rudstones, interbedded with fine-grained siliciclastic mudstones. Most limestones exhibit some evidence of pedogenic brecciation and root penetration, and porous fabrics similar to those of modern limestone tufas occur locally. The interbedded mudstones are typically lenticular and commonly display a blocky ped fabric in which subequant peds are separated by sparry calcite veins. Fossils from the Ojo Huelos Member are freshwater (darwinulid) ostracodes, various freshwater fishes and aquatic/amphibious tetrapods-metoposaurs and phytosaurs. We interpret the carbonate facies as the deposits of carbonate lakes, ponds and wetlands that were partly spring-fed, whereas the interbedded and surrounding mudstones were alluvial in origin. The groundwater and overland hydrology of the region was likely controlled by the relative proximity to an upland recharge area in the Mogollon Highlands to the south, but sedimentary fabrics record strong overprinting by desiccation and pedogenic reworking. Consequently, we interpret the Ojo Huelos Member as recording a climate that varied from subhumid to semi-arid, which caused episodic falls in the hydrologic base-level. This resulted in landscape degradation, exemplified by significant pedogenic and erosional reworking of the carbonate sediments and fluvial incision. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The characteristics and evaluation of water pollution in Ganjiang Tail River	3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WATER RESOURCE AND ENVIRONMENT (WRE 2017)	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science				3rd International Conference on Water Resource and Environment (WRE)	JUN 26-29, 2017	Qingdao, PEOPLES R CHINA					The water quality in Ganjiang River has an important impact on the ecological environment of Poyang Lake, because Ganjiang River is an important water supply of Poyang Lake. In this paper, the electrical conductivity (ED), turbidity (NTU), suspended solids (SS), total phosphorus (NP), total nitrogen (NT), ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), and chemical oxygen demand quantity (COD) have been considered as indicators of water quality while performing an assessment of water in Ganjiang River. We evaluated and analyzed comprehensively the quality of surface and underground water by using the Water Quality Identification Index Method. The sample water was retrieved every 50 days from eight monitoring points located in three sections of downstream Ganjiang River in Nanchang city; the study was conducted from September 10, 2015 to June 1, 2016. The results indicate that the pollution index of northern, central, and southern tributaries in Ganjiang River downstream are 3.807, 3.567, and 3.795, respectively; these results were obtained by performing the primary pollutants quality identification index method (PP-WQI); the pollution index for the same tributaries was found to be 3.8077, 3.5003, 3.7465, respectively when we performed comprehensive water quality identification index method (CWQI). The water pollution grades are between level 3 and level 4. The main pollutants are COD, TN, and SS; moreover, there is a linear relationship between the pollution index in groundwater and surface water. The water quality is the best in the central branch, and worst in the south; the water quality is moderate in the north. Furthermore, the water of upstream is better than that of downstream. Finally, the water quality is worst in summer but best in winter.

Both the seasonal cycle and the interannual variability of ETCs are quantified in terms of overall cyclone frequency, intensity, and regions of development and decay. We find that ETCs travelling to eastern Canada tend to develop over the Rockies, the Great Lakes and the US East Coast. The ETCs are most intense over Newfoundland and the North Atlantic Ocean, confirming previous findings. While ETCs at cities along the Atlantic coastline (e.g. St. John's) are dominated by East Coast cyclones (which are intense in winter), those inland (e.g. Toronto) track primarily from the Great Lakes. ETCs that develop over the Gulf of Mexico affect eastern Canada infrequently, but those that do tend to be intense. The interannual variability of the wintertime ETCs is influenced by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Significant ENSO-related variability is found over most regions of southern Canada, except on the east coast. Although ETCs at Toronto are significantly modulated by ENSO, no visible changes are found at St. John's. These ENSO-related ETC changes are mostly due to the shifts in ETC development regions, with minor changes in the travelling direction of ETCs.

We present an n-alkane and compound-specific carbon isotope record of the last deglaciation from the annually laminated sedimentary sequence of Lake Xiaolongwan, northeastern China. The n-alkane distribution suggests that the sparsely distributed vegetation prior to 14.7 ka BP, changed to wood plants and aquatic macrophytes in the early BollingAllerod, and was followed by a broadleaved deciduous forest after 11.4 ka BP. In this forest region, where the vegetation is dominated by C3 plants, the compound-specific delta C-13 value of the long-chain n-alkanes (nC(27), nC(29) and nC(31)) is interpreted as a proxy of effective precipitation, while temperature might play a minor secondary role. The positive delta C-13(27-31) values during the Bolling-Allerod suggest a dry-warm climatic condition, while the negative delta C-13(27-31) at 13.0-11.4 ka BP indicates a cold-wet climate during the Younger Dryas in this region. Two periods with lower delta C-13(27-31) occurred at 16.1-16.5 and 17.3-17.7 ka BP and could be associated with the Heinrich event-1a and the Heinrich event-1b, respectively. The synchroneity between the biomarker time series in Lake Xiaolongwan and the delta O-18 record from the Greenland ice core suggest the dominance of high latitude processes on regional monsoon evolution from the last glacial, the BollingAllerod, the Younger Dryas to early Holocene. Regionally, the Okhotsk High might have played an important role for abrupt changes during the glacial/interglacial transition.

Samples were taken at regular intervals using emergence traps, a sweep net and a Rzoska core sampler. Altogether 28 different species were found, 23 of which belonged to the Dytiscidae. A certain seasonal sequence in the larval stages of the most abundant species was observed. Early in summer larvae of Colymbetes striatus and Agabus fuscipennis were present, and those of A. serricornis, Rhantus exsoletus and Graphoderus zonatus at midsummer, while larvae of Hygrotus inaequalis and Ilybius subaeneus were found almost exclusively during the late summer. Larvae of Coelambus impressopunctatus occurred over a longer period of time. During the 5-yr study period the values for species number, diversity and evenness all increased. As the lake increased in age, so did habitat complexity, mainly in connection with the development of the plant community of submersed macrophytes.																			0165-0424	1744-4152					1981	3	4					233	243		10.1080/01650428109361068	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01650428109361068													WOS:A1981NE85900007
J	Amyot, M; Mierle, G; Lean, D; McQueen, DJ				Amyot, M; Mierle, G; Lean, D; McQueen, DJ			Effect of solar radiation on the formation of dissolved gaseous mercury in temperate lakes	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												We have assessed the effect of solar radiation on the formation of dissolved gaseous mercury (DGM) in lake water samples incubated in situ. In temperate forested lakes, solar radiation induced the formation of DGM, whereas in Lake Erie, light had no effect. Tn lakes where photo-induced DGM production was found, DGM concentrations were higher near the surface, whereas in Lake Erie, DGM levels peaked in the metalimnion. In high DOC lakes, removal of UVB radiation did not affect DGM projection, whereas in a low DOC lake, DGM production rates were significantly lower in the absence of UVB radiation, suggesting that DOC compounds are reducing the availability of UVB radiation for photoreduction of Hg. The relationship between light intensity and DGM production was nonlinear in Ranger Lake. Above similar to 3 MJ m(-2) total incident radiation, a plateau was reached at about 400 fM during the summer and about 150 fM during the fall. In this lake, a clear diel pattern of DGM levels was found which paralleled that for total solar radiation. Spiking of samples with Hg(II) prior to incubation in Ranger Lake greatly increased the DGM production rate, suggesting that photoreducible Hg(II) complexes were limiting DGM production. Filtration through GF/F filters or sterilization by heating prior to incubation did not decrease DGM production rates, suggesting that agents promoting DGM formation in Ranger Lake were either dissolved or colloidal. DGM levels in outflows of two high DOC drainage lakes were higher than in inflows, confirming that the lakes were sites of DGM production. Copyright (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To overcome the disadvantages of the open loop SWHP in winter of cold regions, a closed loop SWHP system with casted heat exchanger (CHE) is presented in this paper. The CUE is consisted of pipes immersed in the seawater and used for transferring heat between the seawater and the heat exchanger pipes of the SWHP. In addition, two mathematical models that described heat transfer process of CHE in the icing and non-icing conditions in winter have been developed and validated by an experimental study. The temperature distributions along the CHE were compared between the experimental data and numerical simulation results. The relative error is less than 5%. As a result, application of SWHP systems with CHE in coastal areas in China is feasible due to the favorable geographical conditions and environment.

J	Xue, B; Yu, G				Xue, B; Yu, G			Changes of atmospheric circulation since the last interstadial as indicated by the lake-status record in China	ACTA GEOLOGICA SINICA-ENGLISH EDITION												The effective precipitation and the frame of atmospheric circulation in the past three key periods, i.e. 30 ka BP, 18 ka BP and 6 ka BP, have been analyzed on the basis of the palaeolake status record produced by the Chinese Lake Status Data Base. The results show that the west-central part of China was characterized by high lake-levels at 30 ka BP, resulting from strengthened southwest monsoons; whereas the high lake stand, occurring in the west-central part of China at 18 ka BP, was caused by the southward shift and the strengthening of westerlies although the high-stand distribution was reduced. Meanwhile, the east-central part of China was under the control of strong winter monsoons at 18 ka BP. The high lake-levels, which occurred in the east-central part of China at 6 ka BP, are related to the enhanced East-Asian summer monsoons; while the lowering of the lake-level in the west-central part of China at 6 ka BP was due to the northward shift and corresponding shrink of the westerlies. A comparison between the lake status and the palaeoclimate models has shown that there do exist discrepancies between the geological evidence and the model simulations. The agreement between them provides a possible mechanical explanation on the geological phenomena, but the discrepancy shows that the model needs to be revised to a great extent.																			1000-9515	1755-6724					2000	74	4					836	845																WOS:000166691900011
J	Maguire, CM; Grey, J				Maguire, Caitriona M.; Grey, Jonathan			Determination of zooplankton dietary shift following a zebra mussel invasion, as indicated by stable isotope analysis	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Freshwaters with established zebra mussel populations typically exhibit reduced chlorophyll a concentrations, but the subsequent impacts upon zooplankton are varied. We hypothesised that in an invaded system with less phytoplankton but available allochthonous subsidy, zooplankton may utilise greater proportions of allochthonous matter and that this could be traced by analysis of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes. 2. We used archived zooplankton samples which had been consistently preserved and which spanned the invasion period of an Irish lake, Lough Erne. Increasing reliance upon allochthonous resources would be reflected in an increase in zooplankton delta C-13 away from phytoplankton which is relatively C-13-depleted in humic-stained L. Erne. 3. Analysis of a series of monthly samples (1992-96, 1999-2003) revealed significant C-13-enrichment of mixed zooplankton, Eudiaptomus gracilis and Mysis relicta post-zebra mussel invasion; delta C-13 values approached -27 parts per thousand typical of terrestrial organic matter during spring and autumn. Changes in zooplankton elemental composition also suggested a switch to a lower quality diet. However, analysis of zooplankton delta C-13 from an annual, single-point (June) time series spanning 28 years (1977-2004) suggested that when phytoplankton was sufficiently abundant, zooplankton used this resource and their delta C-13 remained relatively constant around -32 parts per thousand. Post-invasion enrichment of mysid delta N-15 may reflect a shift towards carnivory, but planktonic prey abundance was reduced and a subsequent loss of body condition could result in the same isotopic changes. 4. Our results indicate that in L. Erne, when phytoplankton was reduced by zebra mussel filtering, zooplankton assimilated more from allochthonous matter, and potentially sustained a higher population than would otherwise be possible. Thus, zebra mussel impact on foodweb structure and function is likely to be different in lakes subject to varying subsidy levels.

However, the heat and mass budget of TPlakes and the performance of contemporary lake models overTP have not been quantified to date. Weutilise 3-yr observations from Ngoring Lake, the largest lake in the Yellow River source region of TP, to investigate the typical properties of the lake-air boundary layer and to evaluate the performance of a simplified lake scheme from the Community Land Model version 4.5 (SLCLM) as one of the most popular lake parameterization schemes in atmospheric models. The strong boundary layer instability during the entire open-water period is a distinguishing feature of the air-lake exchange, similar to the situation over tropical and subtropical lakes, while contrasting to the generally stable atmospheric conditions commonly observed over ice-free temperate and boreal lakes from spring to summer. The rather simple algorithmofSLCLMdemonstrated good performance in these conditions. A series of sensitivity simulations with SLCLM revealed strong shortwave solar radiation and cold air temperatures because of high altitude as the primary factors causing the boundary layer instability. The outcomes of the study (1) demonstrate the role of TP lakes as accumulators of shortwave solar radiation releasing the heat into the atmosphere during the entire open-water period; (2) justify the use of simple lake models for the Tibetan highlands, while revealing remarkable uncertainties in the estimations of the latent heat flux; (3) qualify the strong cool-skin effect on the lake surface which results from permanent negative air-lake temperature difference, and should be taken into account when interpreting remote sensing data from highland areas.

Planktonic ciliates were examined during a spring-summer period (November 1998-April 1999) in the ultraoligotrophic Lake Moreno Oeste (41degrees5'S and 71degrees33'W, 758 m a.s.l), which belongs to the Nahuel Huapi System (Patagonia, Argentina). The lake is deep (Z(max) = 90 m) and warm monomictic. 2. Sampling was performed at a mid-lake station, where vertical profiles of temperature and light were measured in situ, and samples for bacteria and ciliates enumeration were taken throughout the water column. 3. The peritrich Ophrydium naumanni, a freshwater pelagic ciliate with endosymbiotic Chlorella, was the dominant ciliate in the lake. 4. Ophrydium naumanni and autotrophic picoplankton exhibit a clear coincidence in their vertical distribution (P < 0.05), preferring levels at or near the 1% of surface photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) irradiance. Both may have the same light requirements, or the coincidence may reflect a trophic relationship. 5. Dependence on light and prey by O. naumanni were studied using field experiments, in which we analysed ciliate grazing on bacteria, and in laboratory experiments, in which we compared particle uptake under dark and light conditions. 6. Ophrydium naumanni was able to ingest particles [latex microspheres and fluorescently labelled bacteria (FLB)] in field and laboratory experiment, indicating that it has the potential to affect bacteria population of Lake Moreno Oeste. 7. Ciliate particle ingestion was observed to be dependent on light availability because under dark conditions, the ingestion was lowered (P < 0.05).					; Balseiro, Esteban/Y-2743-2019	Modenutti, Beatriz/0000-0002-8683-5679; Balseiro, Esteban/0000-0002-5052-0587; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				JAN	2002	47	1					121	128		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00783.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00783.x													WOS:000173397900011
J	LONGABUCCO, P; RAFFERTY, MR				LONGABUCCO, P; RAFFERTY, MR			DELIVERY OF NONPOINT-SOURCE PHOSPHORUS FROM CULTIVATED MUCKLANDS TO LAKE-ONTARIO	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Cultivated mucklands (Histosols) in western New York State were investigated as a nonpoint source of P to Lake Ontario. The 70,500-ha Oak Orchard Creek watershed, which contains 3250 had a heavily fertilized much cropland, was monitored at several sites for a year in order to construct a P budget for the system and determine the mucklands'' relative contribution. Runoff during the late winter-early spring period appears to be the most important hydrologic factor in governing annual phosphorus loading from the mucklands, greater than either total precipitation or total runoff for the year. Surplus P leached from muckland soils and delivered to the creek in subsurface runoff accounts for the large dissolved P load measured in the creek at the study site draining the muck cropland. At this stream monitoring location, the mucklands represented only 27% of the drainage area, but were estimated to contribute between 55 and 86% of the annual dissolved reactive P (DRP) load. The load from Oak Orchard Creek to Lake Ontario for the study period was 37,000 kg of total P (TP), 20,000 kg of which was DRP. Half of the P load was delivered to Lake Ontario in 3 months.sbd.March, April, and May.sbd.when rain and snowmelt produced significant runoff and high creek flows. A mass balance calculation suggest that as much as 72% of the DRP load and 39% of the TP load entering Lake Ontario from Oak Orchard Creek could be attributed to P losses from the cultivated mucklands located 65 km upstream.																			0047-2425	1537-2537				APR-JUN	1989	18	2					157	163		10.2134/jeq1989.00472425001800020005x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1989.00472425001800020005x													WOS:A1989U450600005
J	Dommanget, E; Graff, B				Dommanget, Etienne; Graff, Benjamin			Snowmelt inflow forecasting method for mountain water resource management	HOUILLE BLANCHE-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE L EAU												Water supply management is becoming more and more specific, especially in managing complex uses of mountain water reservoirs: hydroelectricity, agriculture or tourism. Those challenges imply to care about the reservoirs filling. Snow storage and melting represent a big part of the reservoirs storage from spring to summer. Our aim is to assess snow storage capacity and to forecast its melting timing. So as to develop such models, different sorts of data have been used: historical series of reservoirs provisions flows, hydrometeorological data from the valley power plant station, snow water equivalent simulated by Crocus, the Meteo France avalanche risk forecasting model. Crocus datasets are spatialized on the whole catchment using an appropriate digital elevation model. The use of this Crocus snow water equivalent data has been validated through analysis of its correlation with observed inflows. Indeed, snow melt water flows deduced from Crocus fit well with inflows from February to July. Thus, a snowmelt inflows forecasting model based on a conceptual degree-day method and initialized with Crocus data has been developed. It uses temperature and precipitation data to calculate the snow cover and the hydrological flows of mountains catchments. Historical meteorological data are employed to generate a hundred of artificial random new series in order to deliver a probabilistic flow forecast. These chosen data match to seasonal meteorological trends, provided by CNR forecasters. Also, uncertainties from model settlement have been introduced to perform the probabilistic forecast. The degree-day model, which presents 8 parameters, has been calibrated on 1994-2010 historical data and validated on years 2012 and 2013. This model was developed in 2011 on the Oule lake catchment. It has been used operationally since 2012 and operational feedbacks are hopeful. Indeed, results are good and forecasted meteorological trends help to get better forecasting. Forecasts for the years 2012 and 2013 are presented, since those years are of particular interest regarding water resource management, because of their, respectively, unusually dry and snowy climatology.																			0018-6368	1958-5551				JUN	2016		3					42	52		10.1051/lhb/2016030	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/lhb/2016030													WOS:000387984300008
J	GILBERT, R; DESLOGES, JR				GILBERT, R; DESLOGES, JR			SEDIMENTS OF ICE-DAMMED, SELF-DRAINING APE LAKE, BRITISH-COLUMBIA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The glacier damming Ape Lake has withdrawn from its Neoglacial terminal moraines in the lake since early in this century at an average rate of 15 m/a. As a result, the first known drainings of Ape Lake occurred in October 1984 and August 1986. In each event, about 54% of the volume of the lake was lost through a tunnel in the damming glacier. Most of the remaining water was held in the deep basin of the lake behind partially breached Neoglacial terminal moraines. As the glaciers have withdrawn, the character of the sediments has changed. Sediments in the deep basin of the lake are varved, but the grain size, especially of the summer deposits, has decreased and rates of sedimentation have decreased from about 4 mm/a to less than 2 mm/a. In shallow water, deposition of varved sediments has given way to the deposition of massive sediments at rates of less than 1 mm/a. Ice-rafted debris is rare in deep water, despite the presence of calving bergs. During and following the first draining, significant subaerial erosion occurred as a result of the event itself, the drawdown and steepened gradients, and the action of waves on the exposed sediments as the lake refilled. In proximal areas, distinct deposits within the normal winter deposits are recognised. In deep water, deposition of massive, highly underconsolidated, fine-grained sediments occurred. Organic debris released from shallow deposits by erosion has become concentrated in both shallow- and deep-water sediments. Within a year of the first draining, sediment loads in the lake water were returning to normal.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				SEP	1987	24	9					1735	1747		10.1139/e87-166	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e87-166													WOS:A1987K593000001

Pollutants accumulated in sediments are threatening water safety and ecological security. Different from others focusing on prevalent heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Zn, As, Cd, Cr, Hg, etc.), in this study, some unheeded metal pollutants Tl, Sb, Mo, Sr, Co, V, Ti, Ca, Mg, Be and Li were monitored in sediments of the Xiangjiang River, China. It was found that there was no remarkable vertical variation with depth, but the seasonal characteristics of Tl, Sb, Mo, Be and Li. The enrichment, pollution and potential ecological risk of Tl, Sb and Mo were revealed by the enrichment factor (EF), geoaccumulation index (I-geo), pollution load index (PLIsite and PLIzone) and potential ecological risk index (RI). It is noticed that the pollution of Tl mainly occurred in summer at midstream and downstream and Mo pollution was much higher than Sb in summer and the reverse in other seasons. Additionally, sediment quality on east side was worse than on west side in Songbai section of the Xiangjiang River. For the first time, the toxic-response factor was figured out as Mo = 18, Tl = 17, Sb = 13, Sr = 6, Co = Be = 1, V = Li = 0, and importantly, the high potential ecological risk of Tl, Sb and Mo needs to be taken seriously for the comprehensive assessment on watershed environmental quality.					; Li, Huan/C-1780-2019	Yang, Jinqin/0000-0001-8411-8206; 													0269-4042	1573-2983				JUN	2019	41	3					1459	1472		10.1007/s10653-018-0230-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-018-0230-9								30542780					WOS:000482428000024

Bacteria were major producers of lipase activity in lake water. About 15 % of the total activity of lipase in lake water was found in cell-free, 0.2-mum filtrate. The V(max) of lipase activity varied markedly in both sampling sites throughout the study period. Highest V(max) were measured in pelagial (754 nmol L-1 h-1) and in littoral (429 nmol L-1 h-1) samples during spring phytoplankton development in April. Very low V(max) (53 nmol L-1 h-1) was found in littoral in May. The Michaelis constants (K(m)) of substrate hydrolysis by lipase in lake water ranged between 12-51 mumol/L (littoral) and from 21 to 78 mumol/L (pelagial). High K(m) values were determined in May, during clear water phase in pelagial (78 mumol/L), and in July (57 and 51 mumol/L in pelagial and littoral, respectively) during summer stratification of the lake. The highest lipase activity was found in samples incubated at pH 7.5, i.e., close to natural pH (7.8) of lake water. Lipase activities of samples decreased when incubated at pH lower and/or higher than 7.5. Various organic compounds, which are bacterial substrates naturally present in lake water, influenced kinetic parameters (K(m) and V(max)) of lipase in lake water.

Lake trout population dynamics at Drummond Island Refuge in Lake Huron: Implications for future rehabilitation	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The Drummond Island Refuge (DIR) was established in 1985 as part of the rehabilitation effort for lake trout Salvelinus namaycush in Lake Huron. Since then, several strains of hatchery-reared lake trout have been stocked annually at the DIR. An intensive lampricide treatment of the St. Marys River during 1998-2001 was expected to lower the abundance of sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus within the DIR by 2000. We conducted annual gill-net surveys during spring and fall to evaluate the performance of each of the strains of lake trout as well as that of the entire lake trout population (all strains pooled) in the DIR during 1991-2005. The criteria to evaluate performance included the proportion of "wild" fish within the population, spawner density, adult survival, growth, maturity, and wounding rate by sea lampreys. Wild lake trout did not recruit to the adult population to any detectable degree. During 1991-2005, the average density of spawning lake trout appeared to be marginally sufficient to initiate a self-sustaining population. Survival of the Seneca Lake (SEN) strain of lake trout was significantly higher than that of the Superior-Marquette (SUP) strain, in part because of the higher sea-lamprey-induced mortality suffered by the SUP strain. However, other factors were also involved. Apparently SUP fish were more vulnerable to fishing conducted in waters near the refuge boundaries than SEN fish. The St. Marys River treatment appeared to be effective in reducing the sea lamprey wounding rate on SEN fish. We recommend that the stocking of SEN lake trout in the DIR, control of sea lampreys in the St. Marys River, and reduction of commercial fishery effort in waters near the DIR be maintained.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG	2008	28	4					979	992		10.1577/M07-083.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M07-083.1													WOS:000259774600001

Here, we provide new high-resolution stable isotope and geochemical data from a 10 m core (Co1262) through the Late Glacial to Holocene and discuss past climate and lake hydrology (TIC, delta C-13(calcite), delta O-18(calcite)) as well as the terrestrial and aquatic vegetation response to climate (TOC, TOC/N, delta C-13(organic), Rock Eval pyrolysis). The data identifies 3 main zones: (1) the Late Glacial-Holocene transition represented by low TIC and TOC contents, (2) the early to mid-Holocene characterised by high TOC and increasing TOC/N and (3) the Late Holocene-Present which shows a marked decrease in TIC and TOC. In general, an overall trend of increasing delta O-18(calcite) from 9 ka to present suggests progressive aridification through the Holocene, consistent with previous records from Lake Ohrid and the wider Mediterranean region. Several proxies show commensurate excursions that imply the impact of short-term climate oscillations, such as the 8.2 ka event and the Little Ice Age. This is the best-dated and highest resolution archive of past Late Glacial and Holocene climate from Lake Ohrid and confirms the overriding influence of the North Atlantic in the north-eastern Mediterranean. The data presented set the context for the International Continental scientific Drilling Program Scientific Collaboration On Past Speciation Conditions in Lake Ohrid project cores recovered in spring-summer 2013, potentially dating back into the Lower Pleistocene, and will act as a recent calibration to reconstruct climate and hydrology over the entire lake history.					; Lacey, Jack/AAL-3601-2020; Francke, Alexander/N-9761-2013; Wagner, Bernd/J-4682-2012; Vane, Christopher/A-8814-2008	Lacey, Jack H./0000-0002-6329-2149; Francke, Alexander/0000-0002-0370-5802; Wagner, Bernd/0000-0002-1369-7893; Vane, Christopher/0000-0002-8150-3640; Leng, Melanie/0000-0003-1115-5166													1437-3254	1437-3262				SEP	2015	104	6					1623	1638		10.1007/s00531-014-1033-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00531-014-1033-6													WOS:000360705700011

Using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), we identified Bph-a in Qinghai Lake sediments from the late glacial period through the Holocene with a resolution of one sample every 30-50 years. The Bph-a profile of Qinghai Lake demonstrates that in the last 18,000 years APB were only present between 4.2 and 14 ka BP, a period of high rainfall and high summer solar insolation. All the APB blooming events correspond to times of enhanced freshwater influx as revealed by percent redness, an indicator of the input of iron oxide minerals. Our data suggest that solar insolation sets the stage for APB blooms, which are then promoted by increased summer monsoon rainfall and nutrients resulting in the development of a chemocline in the lake. The blooming of APB in Qinghai Lake appears as discrete centennial-scale APB events likely linked to solar activities. Our results suggest the presence of solar-induced, century-long, intense summer monsoon episodes in the middle and early Holocene and the late glacial period. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Salmon, Q; Westrelin, S; Dublon, J; Abadie, E; Baudoin, JM				Salmon, Quentin; Westrelin, Samuel; Dublon, Julien; Abadie, Etienne; Baudoin, Jean-Marc			Artificial floating littoral zones: a promising nursery to support Pike (Esox lucius) in reservoirs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The use of water resources in reservoirs leads to artificial water level fluctuations sometimes with extreme amplitudes and frequencies. These artificial fluctuations homogenize littoral habitats and often make macrophytes disappear. Consequently, spawning and refuge-nursery habitats become scarce which is critical for phytophilous species such as Northern Pike (Esox lucius) whose populations decline. Quite recently, floating artificial structures have emerged as a mitigation solution. However, the design of these structures is relatively simplistic and only consists in a simple 2D-floating mat of vegetation. Their effectiveness to support fish populations, especially pike in regulated reservoir, by providing suitable habitats for spawning, refuge and nursery remains poorly documented. Here we conceived 3D artificial Floating Littoral Zones (FLOLIZ) that mimic a natural littoral zone to support both pike spawning and juvenile growth (helophytes, hydrophytes, specific shelter areas). To assess their effectiveness, three structures of 70 m2 area and 1 m deep were installed in September 2018 in a French reservoir subject to extreme water level fluctuations. Visual surveys carried out in spring and summer by snorkelling over 2019-2023 highlighted an annual recurrence of juvenile pike in FLOLIZ, but also a higher abundance than in control stations. The maximum number of individuals observed simultaneously on the same structure was 14. Even if it cannot be asserted that pike spawned in FLOLIZ, these results highlight that FLOLIZ can provide refuge and nursery habitats for juvenile fish in reservoirs with poor littoral habitats.					; westrelin, samuel/JEO-8076-2023	SALMON, Quentin/0000-0003-0151-0208; 														2823-1465				OCT 30	2024	60								22	10.1051/limn/2024022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2024022													WOS:001345934600001

Survival of Advanced-Fingerlings of Florida Largemouth Bass Stocked in Small Florida Lakes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Numerous stocking evaluations of pellet-reared advanced-fingerling (80-120 mm TL) Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides have assessed the contribution of stocked fish to the wild population, but few studies have quantified longer-term (1-2 years) survival. Hatchery researchers have developed spawning Florida Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides floridanus (hereafter, "Florida Bass") out of season (i.e., in fall), allowing for a similar-sized product to be stocked earlier in the spring. Managers are interested in whether poststocking survival is improved by new culture techniques and whether survival can be affected by conditioning (acclimating to the natural environment) the fish before stocking. In this study, we stocked 11 small (<100 ha) lakes in central Florida with pellet-reared advanced-fingerling (mean 105 mm TL) Florida Bass that were spawned out of season, and we conducted mark-recapture population estimates at 1 and 2 years poststocking to assess survival. In the second year of the study, four lakes were stocked a second time with two treatments of Florida Bass (naive and conditioned) to test for the effects of conditioning the fish on survival within the stocked lakes in 0.1-ha predator-limited enclosures for 7 d. At 1 year poststocking, survival ranged from 0.0% to 8.2% (values were <2.5% for all but one lake) and averaged 1.8%. At 2 years poststocking, survival ranged from 0.0% to 2.4% and averaged 0.9%. From the restocked lakes in year 2, we found no effect of conditioning (P = 0.57) on the number of stocked Florida Bass that were caught at 1 year poststocking, and survival ranged from 0.1% to 1.5% for the naive treatment and 0.2% to 1.4% for the conditioned treatment. Despite improved culture techniques and the attempt to acclimate the stocked fish to the wild, survival averaged <2% at 1 year poststocking. Knowledge of projected Florida Bass survival can help managers make informed stocking decisions that are more likely to meet their desired outcome.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				DEC	2020	40	6					1532	1544		10.1002/nafm.10522	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10522		DEC 2020											WOS:000594479800001

The aim of the research is to develop a model for the wastewaters management of the basin's area in order to protect waters in the karst underground. As the research spot a particular karst basin is chosen. Municipial wastewaters are discharged into the basin without any purification and, after holding up in the underground, they appear at the spring of the river which supplies water of the biggest lake on the Balkans. Results determined by the simulation of neural network by inserting qualitative indexes of wastewaters and spring waters, indicate a satisfactory compatibility with measurements. Scientific importance of the shown research is a contribution to development of the karst waters usage and protection methods through an application of the developed model.

J	HARTIG, JH				HARTIG, JH			FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO DEVELOPMENT OF FRAGILARIA-CRONTONENSIS KITTON PULSES IN PIGEON BAY WATERS OF WESTERN LAKE ERIE	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In recent years, anomalous, large, summer Fragilaria crotonensis pulses have been reported from Pigeon Bay. The purpose of this study was to identify the factors which contribute to these pulses, based on experiments designed to investigate the effects of nutrients and the interaction of light and nutrients on growth, field monitoring, and a review of published studies. It was found that summer not only provides optimal water temperatures for F. crotonensis growth, but peak incident solar radiation and water transparency. It is hypothesized that F. crotonensis pulses during summer are dependent upon three major factors: 1) adequate supplies of nutrients (silica and phosphorus); 2) the presence of slight thermal stratification with concomitant wind velocities sufficient to keep cells cirulating in the surface mixed layer; and, 3) the presence of low turbidities with concomitant irradiance sufficient for growth. Once such physicochemical conditions exist, it appears that F. crotonensis can grow rapidly (because it is adapted to low light and is a superior exploitative competitor for phosphorus and silica) and achieve densities as high as 950,000 cells L-1. Such pulses may be terminated by lack of wind (which allows cells to sink out of the photic zone), high wind velocities (which increase turbidity and decrease light penetration), or depletion of nutrients. Fragilaria crotonensis is probably not affected by zooplankton grazing because of its large size and chain-forming morphology. An order of magnitude increase in summer nitrogen:phosphorus ratios in Pigeon Bay since the late 1960s may have provided a more optimal environment for F. crotonensis growth in recent years.																			0380-1330						1987	13	1					65	77		10.1016/S0380-1330(87)71628-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(87)71628-1													WOS:A1987H174300008

Their pelagic-benthic life cycle helps them survive periods of adverse conditions and contributes greatly to their ecological success. Many studies on Microcystis overwintering have focused on benthic colonies and suggest that sediment serves as the major inoculum for subsequent summer blooms. However, the contemporaneous overwintering pelagic population may be important as well but is understudied. In this study, we investigated near-surface and near-bottom pelagic population dynamics of both microcystin-producing Microcystis and total Microcystis over six weeks in winter at Dog Lake (South Frontenac, ON, Canada). We quantified relative Microcystis concentrations using real-time PCR. Our results showed that the spatiotemporal distribution of overwintering pelagic Microcystis was depth dependent. The abundance of near-bottom pelagic Microcystis declined with increased depth with no influence of depth on near-surface Microcystis abundance. In the shallow region of the lake (<10 m), most pelagic Microcystis was found near the lake bottom (>90%). However, the proportion of near-surface Microcystis rose sharply to over 60% as the depth increased to approximately 18 m. The depth-dependent distribution pattern was found to be similar in both microcystin-producing Microcystis and total Microcystis. Our results suggest the top of the water column may be a more significant contributor of Microcystis recruitment inoculum than previously thought and merits more attention in early CHAB characterization and remediation.					博戬, 陈/JPX-3532-2023															2076-2607				AUG	2021	9	8							1718	10.3390/microorganisms9081718	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9081718								34442797					WOS:000689413100001

Wind control on the accumulation of heavy metals in sediment of Lake Ulubat, Anatolia, Turkey	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Freshwater Lake Ulubat (z (mean) = 1.5-2.0 m and Area = similar to 138 km(2)), NW Anatolia, Turkey was filled in by fine-to-medium-grain silts during the late Holocene. Deposition in Lake Ulubat has been 1.6 cm year(-1) for the last 50 years, but the sedimentation rate over the last similar to 1,600 years was lower (0.37 mm year(-1)). The organic matter and carbonate contents of the infill show cyclic changes that reflect environmental fluctuations. The silt-dominated lithology and the vertically uniform heavy metal distributions are probably due to wind-controlled sedimentation in the lake. Heterogeneous mud, derived from a large, mountainous drainage basin, is deposited in the lake mostly during summer, June to October, when conditions are hot and calm. Winter months are stormier and sediments are re-suspended due to the shallow water depth and the effect of waves on the lake bottom. It is likely that re-suspended sediments, particularly fine-grained particles, together with the heavy metals, are transported out of the lake via the outlet, especially during periods of high lake level. This resuspension and removal process probably caused the lake sediments to become silt-dominated and depleted in heavy metals. The role of broad shallow lakes in sequestering sediments and heavy metals can be described more accurately when wind data are considered. Such information may also be helpful for land-use planning in downstream areas.

We summarize and compare carbonate oxygen-isotope records (delta O-18(carb)) from ten lakes within the present-day ISM region. We discuss their paleoclimate significance considering the present-day moisture source, isotopic composition of precipitation and the hydrological setting. The delta O-18(carb) records are controlled mainly by the isotopic composition of lake water, which in turn is a function of regional Precipitation/Evaporation (P/E) balance and the proportion of precipitation that is monsoon-derived. We normalized the delta O-18(carb) data and used these records to generate an integrated moisture index. This index, along with oxygen-isotope records from speleothems and carbon-isotope records (delta C-13(org)) from peats within the monsoon region, suggests that Holocene climate was broadly synchronous across the monsoon region and, within the limits of accuracy of the existing age models, provides no strong evidence for previously-proposed anti-phasing of the ISM and the EASM.

We assessed seasonal variations in the diversity and abundance of alkaline phosphate-encoding genes (phoX) in these 2 zones of Lake Taihu, which is a large, shallow, eutrophic lake in China. There was no significant difference in seasonal mean phoX diversity between the 2 zones, whereas the seasonal mean phoX abundance in the macrophyte-dominated region was higher than that in the algae-dominated region. The bulk of the genotypes in the 2 regions were most similar to the alphaproteobacterial and betaproteobacterial phoX. Genotypes most similar to phoX affiliated with Betaproteobacteria were present with greater diversity in the macrophyte-dominated zone than in the algae-dominated zone. In the algae-dominated zone, the relative proportion of genotypes most similar to cyanobacterial phoX was highest (38.8%) in summer. In addition to the different genotype structures and environmental factors between the 2 stable states, the lower gene abundances and higher alkaline phosphatase activities in Meiliang Bay in summer than those in Xukou Bay reveals different organophosphate-mineralizing modes in these 2 contrasting habitats.					; Gao, Guang/AAJ-8676-2021; Tang, Xiangming/ABG-7095-2021	Tang, Xiangming/0000-0002-2816-1004; 													0008-4166	1480-3275				MAR	2015	61	3					227	236		10.1139/cjm-2014-0446	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjm-2014-0446								25675274					WOS:000352093100007

Differences in Energy Expenditures and Growth Dilution Explain Higher PCB Concentrations in Male Summer Flounder	PLOS ONE												Comparison of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations between the sexes of mature fish may reveal important behavioral and physiological differences between the sexes. We determined whole-fish PCB concentrations in 23 female summer flounder Paralichthys dentatus and 27 male summer flounder from New Jersey coastal waters. To investigate the potential for differences in diet or habitat utilization between the sexes, carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios were also determined. In 5 of the 23 female summer flounder, PCB concentrations in the somatic tissue and ovaries were determined. In addition, we used bioenergetics modeling to assess the contribution of the growth dilution effect to the observed difference in PCB concentrations between the sexes. Whole-fish PCB concentrations for females and males averaged 87 and 124 ng/g, respectively; thus males were 43% higher in PCB concentration compared with females. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios did not significantly differ between the sexes, suggesting that diet composition and habitat utilization did not vary between the sexes. Based on PCB determinations in the somatic tissue and ovaries, we predicted that PCB concentration of females would increase by 0.6%, on average, immediately after spawning due to release of eggs. Thus, the change in PCB concentration due to release of eggs did not explain the higher PCB concentrations observed in males. Bioenergetics modeling results indicated that the growth dilution effect could account for males being 19% higher in PCB concentration compared with females. Thus, the bulk of the observed difference in PCB concentrations between the sexes was not explained by growth dilution. We concluded that a higher rate of energy expenditure in males, stemming from greater activity and a greater resting metabolic rate, was most likely the primary driver for the observed difference in PCB concentrations between the sexes.

Flora and Vegetation in Arbakalir Lake and Charskii Hot Spring (Charskaya Basin, Transbaikalia)	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												As a result of comprehensive studies in Arbakalir Lake and Charskii Hot Spring during the growing season in 2021, the physical and chemical parameters of water and the species and phytocenotic diversity of vegetation were studied. In the flora of water bodies, 56 taxa from seven divisions, of which 31 species belong to flowering plants, 22 species to macroalgae, and one species in each to bryophytes, horsetails, and lycophytes were identified. Two species are included in the Red Book, at both the federal and regional levels. Two species are classified as relict. The structure of the flora contains species of three ecotypes, of which 38 species (67.9%) belong to true aquatic plants. In the syntaxonomic structure of aquatic and coastal aquatic vegetation, 18 associations from 12 formations were identified. Based on factor analysis, the main factors influencing the distribution of phytocenoses are the water temperature, pH, mineralization, and the main cation, anion, and nutrient contents.

However, little is known about the factors controlling annual growth of Arctic mosses and their sensitivity to climatic changes. It has been suggested that nutrient translocation occurs in mosses, and that annual growth of mosses therefore depends strongly on weather conditions and less on local environmental conditions. In this study, we examined annual growth of Drepanocladus trifarius ((F. Weber and D. Mohr) Broth.) from two ponds in West Greenland in relation to weather conditions. A reconstruction of annual growth increments from 2009 to 2014 was made in 200 individual mosses, and biomass and length were related to different weather parameters. In addition, we examined whether there would be an indication of nutrient translocation across annual growth segments. We found a positive relationship between mean summer temperature and growth segment length, which indicates the importance of temperature during seasons with sufficient light levels for growth of the D. trifarius. Weather parameters associated with light conditions had no significant effect on growth, which probably reflect that D. trifarius in two shallow ponds were not light limited. The nutrient stoichiometry showed that phosphorus (P) contents in the tissue were low (0.04-0.11% DW), and nutrient resorption efficiencies of P amounted to 11-29%. This suggests that D. trifarius was P limited during its growth season, but appears capable of nutrient translocation across annual segments, possibly to maintain growth in oligotrophic environments. Despite low nitrogen (N) contents (0.94-2.09%), no resorption of N was found, which indicates that D. trifarius was not N-limited in order to sustain growth. In conclusion, this study shows that growth of D. trifarius in small high Arctic ponds are mainly controlled by summer temperatures.

These values can be compared to estimates which show that biological interactions (expressed as dynamic chaos trajectories) may explain about 50% of the variation in a marine diatom (phytoplankton) population. Thus, physical factors and biological interactions explain as a first approximation about 50% each of the variation in phytoplankton biomass. Visual comparison between observed and predicted phytoplankton time series showed best agreement for the deep (> 100 m), oligotrophic Lake Mjosa. For two shallow lakes the phytoplankton blooms were well predicted in some years, but were grossly underestimated in others. This suggests that there may be a dichotomy among the bloom-forming factors. Outliers in the MVC models could, in some cases, be related to extreme values of physical factors, but as often not. MVC predicted summer average and summer peak phytoplankton biomass better than the OECD equations normally used (Eutrophication of Waters. Monitoring, Assessment, and Control, OECD, Paris, 1982). Thus, since for many lakes there now exist satisfactory calibration data sets, MVC models could replace OECD type models (which are based on data from many lakes) as a tool for predicting lake response to changing nutrient loads. However, in spite of our ability to predict the day of the vernal bloom from a published regression equation using annual temperature and summer mean Chl-a as regressors (observed versus predicted day gave r2 = 0.47, p < 0.0001), we were not able to find any correlation between the observed bloom day and the bloom day of the MVC predicted time series (p > 0.05).																			0169-7439					APR	1994	23	1					247	258		10.1016/0169-7439(93)E0071-B	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0169-7439(93)E0071-B													WOS:A1994NJ97700023

This study investigates the short-term effect of wintertime gaseous carbon exchanges during the harvesting of two wetland plants, Typha latifolia and Phragmites australis , in three different locations in South-eastern Estonia: a free surface water treatment wetland, a natural lake, and a restored bog. Generally, Phragmites and Typha show increased CH 4 -C and CO 2 -C emissions measured for five minutes after harvesting compared to baseline conditions. However, more CO 2 -C emissions were from Typha , while more CH 4 -C were from Phragmites in all study wetlands. The increase in the emissions after harvesting for all study sites was positively influenced by the increase in plant stem surface area and diameter. On average, Typha latifolia at the free surface water treatment wetland emitted more CO 2 -C with a median of 42 mg CO 2 -C m - 2 h -1 after harvesting compared to baseline conditions with a median of 14 mg CO 2 -C m - 2 h -1 . In contrast, the Phragmites plant at the lake emitted more CH 4 -C with a median of 1936 mu g CH 4 -C m - 2 h -1 after harvesting compared to a baseline median emission of 528 mu g CH 4 -C m - 2 h -1 . The study shows that carbon emission from plant stems after harvesting during winter across all studied ecosystems can increase substantially. However, this increase occurs over a short period and is unlikely to impact the annual carbon budget of the wetlands, given that the ecosystem 's carbon balance is primarily influenced by photosynthesis, decomposition, and physical removal of biomass carbon during harvesting and its after -use.

Co-occurrence patterns between phytoplankton and bacterioplankton across the pelagic zone of Lake Baikal during spring	JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY												Phytoplankton and bacterioplankton play a key role in carbon cycling of aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we found that co-occurrence patterns between different types of phytoplankton, bacterioplankton, and environmental parameters in Lake Baikal during spring were different over the course of three consecutive years. The composition of phytoplankton and bacterial communities was investigated using microscopy and 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing, respectively. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) revealed a relationship between the structure of phytoplankton and bacterial communities and temperature, location, and sampling year. Associations of bacteria with diatoms, green microalgae, chrysophyte, and cryptophyte were identified using microscopy. Cluster analysis revealed similar correlation patterns between phytoplankton abundance, number of attached bacteria, ratio of bacteria per phytoplankton cell and environmental parameters. Positive and negative correlations between different species of phytoplankton, heterotrophic bacteria and environmental parameters may indicate mutualistic or competitive relationships between microorganisms and their preferences to the environment.

Variability and trends in runoff in the rivers of British Columbia's Coast and Insular Mountains	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												This study examines the 1914-2015 runoff trends and variability for 136 rivers draining British Columbia's Coast and Insular Mountains. Rivers are partitioned into eastward and westward flowing rivers based on flow direction from the Coast Mountains. Thus, eastward and westward runoff trends and influence of topography on runoff are explored. Our findings indicate that rivers flowing eastward to the Nechako and Chilcotin plateaus contribute the lowest annual runoff compared to westward rivers where runoff is high. Low interannual runoff variability is evident in westward rivers and their alpine watersheds, whereas eastward rivers exhibit high interannual runoff variability. On Vancouver Island, some of the rivers with the highest annual runoff exhibit high interannual variability. A significant (p < .05) negative correlation exists between mean annual runoff (R-m) and latitude, gauged area, mean elevation, and its corresponding coefficient of variation. However, a significant positive correlation was found between the glacierized area of mountainous regions and Rm. The mean coefficient of variation in annual runoff is significantly negatively correlated with latitude and glacierized area, but significantly positively correlated with longitude. Annual and seasonal runoff trend analyses of each river were performed for an early (1936-2015), a middle (1966-2015), and a late (1986-2015) period using the Mann-Kendall test. Trend analyses revealed a shift towards more positive detectable (signal-to-noise ratio > 1) trends in annual and seasonal runoff from the middle to the late period across the study domain. Most positive detectable seasonal runoff trends in the middle period occur in spring in glacierized westward rivers located > 1,200 m, whereas in the late period, they all occur in fall and are regionally coherent around Vancouver Island and south coastal BC. Rivers draining eastward exhibit more positive trends over 1986-2015 compared to westward rivers. This study provides crucial information on the hydrology of mountain watersheds across British Columbia's coast in response to Pacific Decadal Oscillation phase changes, the elevational amplification of regional climate change, and their influences on precipitation and glacier retreat.

Lake Erie Microcystis: Relationship between microcystin production, dynamics of genotypes and environmental parameters in a large lake	HARMFUL ALGAE												Cyanobacteria of genus Microcystis sp. have been commonly found in Lake Erie waters during recent summer seasons. In an effort to elucidate relationships between microcystin production, genotypic composition of Microcystis community and environmental parameters in a large lake ecosystem, we collected DNA samples and environmental data during a three-year (2003-2005) survey within Lake Erie and used the data to perform a series of correlation analyses. Cyanobacteria and Microcystis genotypes were quantified using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Our data show that Microcystis in Lake Erie forms up to 42% of all cyanobacteria, and that Microcystis exists as a mixed population of potentially toxic and (primarily) non-toxic genotypes. In the entire lake, the total abundance of Microcystis as well as the abundance of microcystin-producing Microcystis is strongly correlated with the abundance of cyanobacteria suggesting that Microcystis is a significant component of the cyanobacterial community in Lake Erie during summer seasons. The proportion of total Microcystis of all cyanobacteria was strongly linked to the microcystin concentrations, while the percentage of microcystin-producing genotypes within Microcystis population showed no correlation with microcystin concentrations. Correlation analysis indicated that increasing total phosphorus concentrations correlate strongly with increasing microcystin concentrations as well as with the total abundance of Microcystis and microcystin-producing Microcystis.

J	Fayram, AH; Hansen, MJ; Nate, NA				Fayram, AH; Hansen, MJ; Nate, NA			Determining optimal stocking rates using a stock-recruitment model: An example using walleye in Northern Wisconsin	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We propose that stock-recruitment models can be used to estimate optimal stocking rates. Data to estimate the optimal stocking rates can be obtained in a relatively short amount of time by sampling similar populations over a few years. Whether the goal of stocking is endangered species recovery or supplementation of recreational fisheries, accurately determining the optimal stocking rate is of ecological and financial importance. As an example, we applied this approach using a Ricker stock-recruitment model to walleye Swider vitreus stocking in northern Wisconsin lakes. Using June stocking data and fall age-0 Survey data for 39 lakes over a 14-year time period, we found that the stocking rate resulting in the greatest number of age-0 walleyes was 60 age-0 walleyes/ha. Similarly, using June stocking data and fall age-1 survey data in 18 lakes over a 9-year time period we found that the stocking rate resulting in the greatest number of age-1 walleyes was 75 age-0 walleyes/ha. About 16% of the variation in fall age-0 walleye density was explained by the stocking rate, and 28% of the variation in fall age-1 walleye density was explained by the stocking rate. Density-dependent survival was apparent and significant, as low and high stocking densities resulted in lower age-0 and age-I juvenile walleye densities. The lake surface area explained a significant amount of the residual variation in the age-1 stock-recruitment relationship Such that stocked walleyes generally survived at lower rates in large lakes than in small lakes, which may be due to a greater diversity of predators in larger lakes. Based on our analysis, we recommend stocking small fingerling walleyes at a rate of 75 fish/ha in northern Wisconsin lakes.

Fish (yearling yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and macrophytes (Potamogeton crispus) presence and absence were set at the beginning of the experiment to yield four combinations of duplicate treatments. The purpose of the experiment was to determine if the phytoplankton, zooplankton, macrophytes and fish species resident in the lake interact to influence water quality (major ions, phosphorus, algal densities and water clarity). The presence of fish was associated with: (1) decreased biomass of total zooplankton, (2) decreased number of species in the zooplankton, (3) decreased average size of several zooplankton taxa, (4) higher total phosphorus concentrations, (5) higher phytoplankton and chlorophyll alpha concentrations, (6) lower water clarity, (7) lower potassium levels during macrophyte die-back, (8) lower pH and higher conductivity in the presence of macrophytes. Biomass of large Daphnia species (but not total zooplankton) was highly correlated with the algal response (r(2) = 0.995) and was associated with reduced biomass of several algal taxa including some large forms (Mougeotia, Oedogonium) and several colonial blue-green algae. However, no significant control of late summer growth of the bloom-forming blue-green alga Anabaena planctonica Brun. was achieved by the Daphnia presence-fish absence treatment. Release of phosphorus to the water column during the die-back of P. crispus was not an important phenomenon.																			0018-8158					FEB 9	1996	319	1					73	85		10.1007/BF00020973	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00020973													WOS:A1996UA94700008

It has been found that Coriolis forces in combination with strong winds that generate large-scale circulation flows of water masses have a significant impact on the alongshore flow velocity. The analysis of the spatial distributions of physical parameters showed that strong westerly winds directed opposite to the horizontal movement of the thermal front lead to a shift of the cyclonic circulation induced by the Coriolis force into the lower layers of the water column.

Despite the use of meadow hay, leaf-fodder remained an important winter supplement until the present. Archaeological evidence lists Quercus, Tilia, Ulmus, Acer, Fraxinus and Corylus as woody species harvested for leaf-fodder, while Fagus, Populus or Carpinus were rarely used. The aim of our study was to test whether the use of listed woody species followed the pattern of their forage quality (syn. nutritive value). In late May 2012, we collected leaf biomass at four localities in the Czech Republic and determined concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, neutral- and acid-detergent fibre and lignin. Species with leaves of low forage quality were Carpinus betulus, Fagus sylvatica and Quercus robur, species with leaves of intermediate quality were Corylus avellana and Populus tremula and species with leaves of high quality were Ulmus glabra, Fraxinus excelsior, Tilia cordata and Acer platanoides. Selective browsing and harvesting of high quality species Acer, Fraxinus, Tilia and Ulmus thus probably supported their decline in the Bronze and Iron ages and supported the expansion of Carpinus and Fagus. Our results indicate that our ancestors' practice of exploiting woody species as leaf-hay for winter fodder followed their nutritive value.					; Hejcmanová, Pavla/AAD-4910-2021	Hejcmanova, Pavla/0000-0001-9547-4302; Hejcman, Michal/0000-0002-3513-2017													0939-6314	1617-6278				SEP	2014	23	5					607	613		10.1007/s00334-013-0414-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-013-0414-2													WOS:000340522800011
J	Kim, C; Nishimura, Y; Nagata, T				Kim, C; Nishimura, Y; Nagata, T			Role of dissolved organic matter in hypolimnetic mineralization of carbon and nitrogen in a large, monomictic lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We tested the hypothesis that dissolved organic matter (DOM) is delivered to deep layers by convective mixing in winter, where it contributes to the mineralization of C, N, and P in the oxygenated hypolimnion of large (surface area 674 km(2), maximum depth 104 m), monomictic Lake Biwa. Basin-scale, seasonal measurements of DOM concentrations revealed that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) accumulated in the epilimnion during warm seasons and were redistributed into the deeper layer during winter overturn. Hypolimnetic DOC and DON decreased in concentration over the stratification period, indicating mineralization; the contributions of DOM to the total mineralization of C and N were 8% and 30%, respectively. Higher contribution of N relative to C suggests that the N-rich DOM was mineralized at depth. We failed to detect a significant contribution of dissolved organic phosphorus to P mineralization in the hypolimnion, which could be explained by substantial depletion in P relative to C and N of DOM; C: P and N: P ratios were 1,978 and 147, respectively. The data suggest that convective mixing in this monomictic basin delivers DOM to hypolimnetic depths, where it is mineralized during subsequent periods of stratification.																			0024-3590					JAN	2006	51	1					70	78		10.4319/lo.2006.51.1.0070	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2006.51.1.0070													WOS:000237399700008

In our study, however, we found that the temporal occurrence of C. hirundinella in Spanish reservoirs greatly differs from that typically described in temperate zone aquatic systems. We analysed the temporal occurrence of C. hirundinella populations as well as physical and chemical variables in one hundred Spanish reservoirs. C. hirundinella was present in most (74%) of the reservoirs. In 78% of the reservoirs with C. hirundinella occurrence, the species was present during winter time and in 70% it was present during all four seasons. C. hirundinella was very commonly present in Spanish reservoirs in winter time despite the mixing conditions and lower temperatures and light availability. The presence of the species was positively related to water ionic content (HCO3-, SO42-, Ca2+, Mg2+). We conclude that C. hirundinella temporal occurrence in southern north-temperate systems greatly differs from the seasonality typically described for the temperate zone and could be regulated by different factors than those operating in the northern north-temperate zone.

Both models have been calibrated against the observed daily runoff at the watershed outlet (Yingluoxia Hydrological Station) for the period of 1995-2004 and validated for the period of 2005-2009. Results show that both SWAT and DLBRM produced reasonable results in this study, and DLBRM performed better than SWAT. The difference in performance is mainly due to data constraints, different interpolation schemes, and spatial representations of landscape variations in the models. The tank storage-output principle used in DLBRM seems more suitable than the Soil Conservation Service curve number (SCS-CN) method used in SWAT to simulate daily flow in an arid area. Both models performed worse in simulating low flows mostly occurring in spring and winter, because of a lack of detailed representation of the impacts of snow-melting processes and frozen soils. The authors' analysis indicates that consideration of the impacts of snow melting and frozen soils on the hydrological process is key to improving performance of hydrological models in mountainous areas. Because of their simpler operations, lower data requirements, fewer input parameters, and better performances, distributed conceptual models such as DLBRM seem more suitable for hydrological modeling in data-deficient, high elevation, and topographically complex mountainous watersheds in arid regions.

J	Li, YY; Zhao, P; Dor, J; Zhang, HC				Li, Yanyan; Zhao, Ping; Dor, Ji; Zhang, Haichao			Multi-isotopes (H, O, Sr, and Li) and element geochemistry constrain the formation of Kongchutso helium-rich geothermal field in western Tibet, China	GEOTHERMICS												The Kongchutso geothermal field hosts helium -rich hot springs with helium contents (up to 1.54 vol.%) higher than industrial grade of He resources (0.05 - 0.1 vol.%). However, the geochemical signature of helium -rich geothermal fluids, reservoir feature, and their genesis remain poorly understood. Here, we present element geochemistry (major and trace elements) and multi -isotopes (H, O, Sr, and Li) compositions of hot and cold springs, lake, calcareous sinters, and rocks from Kongchutso to determine the formation mechanism of heliumrich geothermal system. The major elements studies of water samples show that most helium -rich hot spring waters belong to the Na-HCO 3 -Cl type, possibly affected by water -rock interaction in the deep and mixing of geothermal fluids with groundwater in the shallow. Based on chalcedony geothermometers and silica enthalpy mixing model, the reservoir temperature has been calculated to be 106 - 118 degrees C. The H and O isotopic compositions of water samples manifest that the Kongchutso geothermal system was recharged by snow -melt water and meteoric precipitation from the surrounding mountains at an elevation of 5366 m. The widespread Cretaceous granites in the region featured by high enrichment of uranium (up to 34.15 ppm) and thorium (up to 37.49 ppm) are considered as helium and heat sources, and also are reservoir rocks. The interpretation is supported by consistent signatures of rare earth elements and Sr -Li isotopes for waters, calcareous sinters, and granites. Therefore, we suggest that the helium was initially generated via radioactive decay by U-Th in granites and then dissolved in the deep circulated and heated meteoric waters, and finally ascended to surface through the main fault systems to form the helium -rich hot springs at Kongchutso. Some other hydrothermal manifestations, such as calcareous sinters, formed accompanying the fluids migrated to the surface. Based on these new findings, we further proposed that high radioactive granite, together with tectonic system and surface hydrothermal manifestations can be used as indicators for exploration of helium -rich geothermal resources in Tibet and elsewhere in the world.					李, 艳艳/AAX-2977-2021; ZHAO, PING/KGK-7973-2024														0375-6505	1879-3576				JUN	2024	120								102986	10.1016/j.geothermics.2024.102986	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geothermics.2024.102986		MAR 2024											WOS:001221911500001

J.; Jovane, Luigi			Spatial-temporal heterogeneity in a small lake and its implication for paleoclimate reconstruction	LIMNOLOGY												Lakes provide continuous records of past regional and global climate. Most studies utilize single trench section dig from the lake shore margins or from single core in the central part/depocenter of the lakes for paleoclimate reconstruction. These reconstructions are based on the assumption of homogenous sedimentation across the lake. However, single core approach for paleoclimate reconstruction is often debated due to inter-site spatial and temporal variations in sedimentation and proxy responses. Therefore, in the present study, we explored the spatial-temporal heterogeneity in a small post-glacial lake of the Lahaul Himalaya and its influence on paleoclimate reconstruction. The depocenter of lake received similar to 2.5 times higher average sedimentation compared to the shore margin. Despite the distinct sedimentation rate in depocenter and shore margin, environmental magnetic and total organic carbon (TOC) records showed similar environmental signals over equivalent time periods. The depocenter core provided high-resolution lacustrine environment, whereas the marginal trench recorded major shifts in paleoclimate over a longer time scale. New multi-proxy data showed strengthened Indian summer monsoon (ISM) during medieval climate anomaly (MCA) and weakened ISM during little ice age (LIA) in the NW Himalaya.					; Sangode, Satish/MBG-5274-2025; Gupta, Anil/D-1108-2010; Jovane, Luigi/AAH-5438-2020; Srivastava, Priyeshu/F-2002-2015	Sangode, Satish/0000-0002-3433-977X; Rawat, Suman/0000-0003-2944-5284; Srivastava, Priyeshu/0000-0001-7672-1929													1439-8621	1439-863X				JAN	2022	23	1					17	35		10.1007/s10201-021-00669-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-021-00669-9		JUL 2021											WOS:000676089000001
J	Hastings, RC; Saunders, JR; Hall, GH; Pickup, RW; McCarthy, AJ				Hastings, RC; Saunders, JR; Hall, GH; Pickup, RW; McCarthy, AJ			Application of molecular biological techniques to a seasonal study of ammonia oxidation in a eutrophic freshwater lake	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The autotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in a eutrophic freshwater lake,were studied over a 12-month period. Numbers of ammonia oxidisers in the lakewater were small throughout the gear, and tangential-flow concentration was required to obtain meaningful estimates of most probable numbers. Sediments from littoral and profundal sites supported comparatively large populations of these bacteria, and the nitrification potential was high, particularly in summer samples from the littoral sediment surface. In enrichment cultures, lakewater samples nitrified at low (0.67 mM) ammonium concentrations only whereas sediment samples exhibited nitrification at high (12.5 mM) ammonium concentrations also. Enrichments at low ammonium concentration did not nitrify when inoculated into high-ammonium medium, but the converse was not true. This suggests that the water column contains a population of ammonia oxidizers that is sensitive to high ammonium concentrations. The observation of nitrification at high ammonium concentration by isolates from some winter lakewater samples, identified as nitrosospiras by 16S rRNA probing, is consistent with the hypothesis that sediment ammonia oxidizers enter the water column at overturn. With only one exception, nested PCR amplification enabled the detection of Nitrosospira 16S rDNA in all samples, but Nitrosomonas (N. europaea-eutropha lineage) 16S rDNA was never obtained. However, the latter were part of the sediment and water column communities, because their 16S rRNA could be detected by specific oligonucleotide probing of enrichment cultures. Furthermore, a specific PCR amplification regime for the Nitrosomonas europaea ammonia monooxygenase gene (amoA) yielded positive results when applied directly to sediment and lakewater samples. Patterns of Nitrosospira and Nitrosomonas detection by 16S rRNA oligonucleotide probing of sediment enrichment cultures were complex, but lakewater enrichments at low ammonium concentration were positive for nitrosomonads and not nitrosospiras. Analysis of enrichment cultures has therefore provided evidence for the existence of subpopulations within the lake ammonia-oxidizing community distinguishable on the basis of ammonium tolerance and possibly showing a seasonal distribution between the sediment and water column.					; Saunders, Jonathan/B-5884-2011	Pickup, Roger William/0000-0002-9469-1724; 													0099-2240	1098-5336				OCT	1998	64	10					3674	3682											9758784					WOS:000076295100019
J	Chipman, ML; Clegg, BF; Hu, FS				Chipman, Melissa L.; Clegg, Benjamin F.; Hu, Feng Sheng			Variation in the moisture regime of northeastern interior Alaska and possible linkages to the Aleutian Low: inferences from a late-Holocene δ18O record	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Analyses of oxygen and carbon isotopes in bulk carbonate and Chara-stem encrustations, X-ray diffraction, and sediment composition from Keche Lake offer new information on climatic change over the past similar to 3,400 years in northeastern interior Alaska. The delta O-18 and delta D values of water samples from the lake and its inlet streams suggest that evaporation plays an important role in determining the isotopic composition of Keche Lake water at present. However, evaporative enrichment does not appear to be a major driver of the pronounced fluctuations in the bulk-carbonate delta O-18 record on the basis of comparison with Chara-delta O-18 values. The delta O-18 values of bulk carbonate in the Keche Lake sediments vary by up to 10 %(0) over the past 3,400 years, with maximum values of -12 %(0) around 3,400 cal BP and between 2,100 and 1,500 cal BP. High delta O-18 peaks are associated with sediments dominated by quartz, feldspar, and clay minerals suggesting the influence of detrital carbonate. Multi-millennial patterns of delta O-18 variation at Keche Lake appear to be linked with changes in watershed and sediment-depositional processes, which may be driven by varying moisture abundance associated with the position of the Aleutian Low (AL). The increasing trend of carbonate delta O-18 from 3,400 to similar to 2,100 cal BP probably reflects the increasing importance of a westerly AL, and the high frequency of delta O-18 spikes similar to 2,100-1,500 cal BP may have resulted from the prevalence of a westerly AL position. Predominance of a westerly AL likely increased snowfall and winter temperature in the region. Such conditions would have promoted soil erosion and thermokarst activity during spring snowmelt, resulting in episodic large influxes of detrital carbonate to Keche Lake and elevating bulk-carbonate delta O-18. Over the past 1,500 years, bulk-carbonate delta O-18 remained relatively high at Keche Lake but variation was much less pronounced than before. A broad delta O-18 peak centered similar to 400 cal BP may be related to enhanced winter moisture during the Little Ice Age, although our chronology is inadequate for a rigorous assessment of this interpretation. This study contributes a new delta O-18 record and offers additional information on past moisture-regime shifts associated with changing atmospheric-circulation patterns.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				JUN	2012	48	1			SI		69	81		10.1007/s10933-012-9599-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-012-9599-0													WOS:000304566900006

Particularly, avian in fluenza (AI) is a viral epidemic disease for which the poultry-wild bird interface shapes the risks of new viral introductions into poultry holdings. Given this background, the study hereby presented aimed to identify wild bird species in poultry house surroundings and characterize the spatiotemporal patterns of these visits. Eight camera traps were deployed for a year (January to December 2021) in 3 commercial chicken layer farms, including free-range and barn -type setups, located in a densely populated poultry area in Northern Italy at high risk for AI introduction via wild birds. Camera traps ' positions were chosen based on wildlife signs identi fied during preliminary visits to the establishments studied. Various methods, including time series analysis, correspondence analysis, and generalized linear models, were employed to analyze the daily wild bird visits. A total of 1,958 camera trap days yielded 5,978 videos of wild birds from 27 different species and 16 taxonomic families. The animals were predominantly engaged in foraging activities nearby poultry houses. Eurasian magpies ( Pica pica ), ring-necked pheasants ( Phasianus colchicus ), and Eurasian collared doves ( Streptopelia decaocto ) were the most frequent visitors. Mallards ( Anas platyrhynchos ), an AI reservoir species, were observed only in a farm located next to a fishing sport lake. Time series analysis indicated that wild bird visits increased during spring and winter. Farm and camera trap location also in flu- enced visit frequencies. Overall, the results highlighted speci fic species that could be prioritized for future AI epidemiological surveys. However, further research is required to assess their susceptibility and infectivity to currently circulating AI viruses, essential for identifying novel bridge hosts.					; lupini, caterina/Y-1141-2019; Graziosi, Giulia/ADC-0688-2022	CATELLI, ELENA/0000-0002-6232-0857; Mannelli, Alessandro/0000-0003-1623-8761; Graziosi, Giulia/0000-0001-9857-1298													0032-5791	1525-3171				AUG	2024	103	8							103892	10.1016/j.psj.2024.103892	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2024.103892		JUN 2024						38865769					WOS:001253564800001

Simulations and modern observations have revealed that a strengthened EASM results in more precipitation in the monsoon marginal zone. Therefore, quantitative reconstruction of precipitation in this region is the key to revealing monsoon variability. Here, two closed-basin lakes, namely, Angulinao Lake and Dali Lake, with similar weather conditions on the southeastern margin of the Mongolian Plateau are studied. The Angulinao paleolake level is established by optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of 17 beach ridges. The annual precipitation (AP) is calculated for Angulinao and Dali Lakes using a hydrological and energy balance model. A composite precipitation curve is obtained, which shows that the AP increased with time during the early Holocene, reached its maximum 9.2 ka, was generally high in the middle Holocene with two events of decreasing AP 7.7 ka and 5.2 ka, and decreased abruptly beginning 4.4-4.2 ka, followed by a continuous reduction to the lowest level observed at present. These results suggest that the oxygen isotopes of speleothems are proxies for EASM (circulation) intensity, the simulated AP does not underestimate the Holocene peak precipitation, and the pollen-based AP in neighboring lakes underestimates the early Holocene precipitation and fails to capture the precipitation peak 9.2 ka.					; Li, Xusheng/ITT-5389-2023; Cheng, Jun/G-4625-2013	Li, Xusheng/0000-0002-1261-3619; Wang, Yuchen/0000-0002-8744-3634; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				JUN 15	2022	596								110968	10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.110968	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.110968		APR 2022											WOS:000802949300001
J	Aukema, BH; Dahlsten, DL; Raffa, KF				Aukema, BH; Dahlsten, DL; Raffa, KF			Exploiting behavioral disparities among predators and prey to selectively remove pests: Maximizing the ratio of bark beetles to predators removed during semiochemically based trap-out	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Mass-trapping using semiochemical lures is a potentially useful control measure against bark beetle pests. A serious problem, however, is the inadvertent removal of predators that respond to these baits as kairomones. Ips pini (Say) infests hard pines in the western, Great Lakes, and eastern forests of North America. In Wisconsin, I. pini responds primarily to 50(+) /50(-) and 75(+) /25(-) blends of ipsdienol, its principal pheromone component. Its response is increased by a synergist, lanierone. Its most abundant predators in Wisconsin include Thanasimus dubius (F.), which responds to similar blends of ipsdienol, and Platysoma cylindrica (Paykull) and P. parallelum (Say), which respond to primarily (-) enantiomers of ipsdienol. These predators do not show increased response when lanierone is released in addition to ipsdienol. We conducted a no-choice assay using rotating blends of ipsdienol and lanierone to simulate a trap-out treatment. Lures that contain enantiomers of ipsdienol most preferred by I. pini, in combination with lanierone, can selectively remove up to three to six times more pests than predators during the spring. Moreover, delaying deployment of the same lures until summer can result in removal of up to 39 rimes more pests than predators. In contrast, lures that contain enantiomers of ipsdienol most preferred by predators can inadvertently remove two or more predators per each bark beetle trapped. Exploiting these behavioral differences between pests and predators can improve biological control by conserving predators during trap-out programs.																			0046-225X	1938-2936				JUN	2000	29	3					651	660		10.1603/0046-225X-29.3.651	http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X-29.3.651													WOS:000089623400031
J	Gutseit, K; Berglund, O; Granéli, W				Gutseit, Kelly; Berglund, Olof; Graneli, Wilhelm			Food quality for Daphnia in humic and clear water lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Growth and reproduction of Daphnia fed lake seston were measured in two categories of meso- to eutrophic lakes differing with respect to terrestrial organic matter influence (humic and clear water lakes). The content of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA), P and N, as well as the taxonomical composition of seston were analysed. 2. Seston HUFA and C : P ratios were similar between lake categories, whereas C : N ratios were lower in the clear water lakes in both spring and summer. Despite the similarity in HUFA and P content of seston, Daphnia growth rate, clutch size and the proportion of gravid females were, respectively, about 1.5, 3 and 6 times higher in the clear water lakes. 3. Differences in growth and reproduction were related to a combination of higher N content and good fatty acid quality of the seston in the clear water lakes. Relatively high biomass of edible algae, such as Rhodomonas sp. and Cryptomonas sp., in the clear water lakes, and differences in water pH likely contributed to the observed differences in Daphnia growth and reproduction between lake categories. Additionally, it is possible that Daphnia was energy limited in the humic lakes despite high particulate organic carbon (POC) concentrations, as the contribution of non-algal and detrital C to the POC pool was high. 4. Our results suggest that dietary HUFA content has the potential to improve herbivore growth and reproduction if N and P are not limiting. N merits more attention in studies of zooplankton nutrition.

J	GASOL, JM; SIMONS, AM; KALFF, J				GASOL, JM; SIMONS, AM; KALFF, J			PATTERNS IN THE TOP-DOWN VERSUS BOTTOM-UP REGULATION OF HETEROTROPHIC NANOFLAGELLATES IN TEMPERATE LAKES	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The importance of resources versus that of predators in determining the abundance of organisms is modulated by several factors which vary over time and space. Here, we evaluate the abundance of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF), the main predators of planktonic bacteria, in the plankton of 16 Quebec lakes as a function of the abundance of resources and zooplankton (predators). We analyze the data at two different scares: among lakes varying in resource supply and within lakes. Resource factors (total phosphorus, chlorophyll, bacterial concentration) best explained the abundances of HNF among lakes differing in resource availability. When the effect of resource availability was removed, the biomass of cladocerans became an important determinant of HNF abundance, with abundance declining and the ratio of bacteria per flagellate increasing, as the cladocerans increased. Within lakes, HNF abundance was not a direct function of resource concentration. Multiple regression models based on data for many lakes showed that both bottom-up (food) and top-down (predation) variables predicted HNF abundance quite well. An examination of the seasonal pattern among individual lakes showed each group of variables differing in importance: bottom-up variables were more important in spring and top-down variables in midsummer. An examination of the effects of different assemblages of zooplankton on HNF showed cladocerans to exert the highest negative impact on HNF and to be responsible for keeping low HNF numbers during most of the summer with that probably affecting the pathways of energy flux in those lakes dominated by cladocerans Versus those dominated by other zooplankton. The absolute, as well as the relative, importance of the different biotic and abiotic factors examined in predicting the abundance of HNF is a function of the scale of the investigation. Among lakes varying greatly in resource supply, resources are found to better correlate with HNF abundance. When the analysis is performed at another scale, within lakes, the relative importance of resources and predation in determining HNF abundances changes depending on the variability superimposed by other factors (seasonality and lake food web structure).

J	Kazanjian, G; Brothers, S; Köhler, J; Hilt, S				Kazanjian, Garabet; Brothers, Soren; Kohler, Jan; Hilt, Sabine			Incomplete recovery of a shallow lake from a natural browning event	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Terrestrial loads of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) have increased in recent years in many north temperate lakes, leading to widespread brownification. This process can profoundly alter the relative strength of planktonic and benthic primary production in lakes due to changes in light and nutrient availability. While most existing in situ studies of brownification focus on gradual decadal trends, short-term flooding can induce rather sudden natural browning events in lakes. We investigated the recovery of a small, temperate, groundwater-fed shallow lake from a strong natural flooding-induced browning and nutrient loading event. We hypothesised that along with a return to pre-flood lake water levels, DOC concentrations would return to pre-flood concentrations due to bacterial and photolytic mineralisation and flocculation, while total phosphorus (TP) concentrations would show a delayed and potentially incomplete recovery due to sustaining effects of phytoplankton dominance on nutrient dynamics in the lake. Phytoplankton gross primary production (GPP), which surged in response to higher nutrient concentrations and a compressed mixing depth, was expected to follow the same recovery pattern as TP. Benthic periphyton GPP was expected to recover in tandem with improving light conditions. We measured post-flood water levels, water chemistry, and summer pelagic and benthic GPP. The lake water level declined gradually, returning to pre-flood levels within 4 years. As hypothesised, DOC concentrations initially declined rapidly, but remained 1.5-fold higher (c. 22 mg/L) than pre-flood values 3 years after peak browning. TP concentrations fluctuated greatly between seasons but remained generally elevated in subsequent years, being roughly double pre-browning values (c. 130 mu g/L) 3 years post-flood. Measurements taken in 2019, 7 years after the initial browning event, showed both DOC and TP concentrations remaining at these elevated levels. Across the intensive study period 3 years before and after peak browning (2010-2015), TP concentrations were positively correlated to summer phytoplankton biomass, while DOC and TP concentrations were negatively correlated to summer periphyton biomass and GPP. Accordingly, the lake's recovery period exhibited a decline of pelagic GPP and a partial recovery of summer periphyton biomass and production, although a full return to pre-flood values was not recorded in either case. Whole-lake areal summertime GPP increased due to browning and remained higher than before the browning event. This study provides a rare examination of differences in response rates between DOC, TP, and autotrophic structure in a shallow, temperate lake following a natural flood-induced extreme browning event. The available data provide compelling evidence that browning events can produce lasting changes in the water chemistry, trophic status, and productive pathways of a lake, persisting beyond the lake's return to pre-flood water levels. Such delayed or incomplete recoveries from flooding-induced browning and nutrient loading may have consequences for regional and long-term temporal trends in lake biogeochemistry, potentially contributing to the widespread phenomenon of incremental brownification.

C	Ray, JA		Beck, BF; Herring, JG		Ray, JA			Spatial interpretation of karst drainage basins	GEOTECHNICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL APPLICATIONS OF KARST GEOLOGY AND HYDROLOGY					8th Multidisciplinary Conference on Sinkholes and the Engineering and Environmental Impacts of Karsts	APR 01-04, 2001	LOUISVILLE, KY	GeoInst Amer Soc Civil Engineers, PELA, Natl Ground Water Assoc				This paper proposes standardized methods to interpret and illustrate karst drainage basins. Dissemination of karst-drainage information is more efficient when lucid karst maps are widely used by karst investigators and educators. Kentucky's Karst Atlas map series is referenced as a model for providing important spatial information to professionals and the public about karst aquifers in Kentucky. Karst features such as sinkholes, eaves, springs, streams, marshes, and intermittent lakes are discussed. Interpretation and illustration of inferred conduit flow routes as curvilinear dendritic networks, is a preferred graphic method over straight-line, hydrologic-connection vectors. Karst-basin boundaries should be verified by tracer testing as much as reasonably possible and should be mapped with broken or dashed lines which infer their approximate nature. Common karst features, traced groundwater flow routes, and the basin boundary, are interpreted and mapped in the Boiling Spring drainage basin of north-central Kentucky. One of the largest karst basins in Kentucky, it was investigated with 15 tracer tests to delineate an approximate watershed area of 326 km(2) (126 mi(2)). The Boiling Spring drainage system is classified as Overflow Allogenic, the most common type of large fluviokarst basin.																					90-5809-190-2				2001							235	244																WOS:000173316100037

Coupling of a physically based lake model into the climate forecast system to improve winter climate forecasts for the Great Lakes region	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												In this study, we coupled the two-layer one-dimensional Freshwater lake (FLake) model into the Climate Forecast System (CFS) version 2 to improve simulations of the effects of the Great Lakes on winter climate forecasts in that region. We first incorporated global lake fraction and depth data into the coupled CFS-FLake through a subgridding system. An interface between the CFS and FLake was then developed to link the two models for energy and water flux exchanges. The lake scheme was triggered only if the lake fraction was more than 10% in one CFS grid cell. We conducted ensemble retrospective forecasts with CFS-FLake for the period of 1997 through 2016 with 9 monthly leads. These forecasts were assessed to obtain a better understanding of the role of the Great Lakes in the climate system for winter, when significant lake-effect precipitation often occurs. Our results indicate that forecasts of lake surface temperature (LST), lake ice coverage (LIC), and precipitation with CFS-FLake were consistently better than those with CFS. The major improvements resulted from changes in land use type for the Great Lakes, from ocean and land in CFS to lakes in CFS-FLake. With the change from ocean to lake, LST mostly decreased with increasing LIC, resulting in lower surface heat and water fluxes to the atmosphere during the winter. However, with the change from land to lake, LST increased, leading to higher heat and water fluxes. In the meantime, precipitation predicted by CFS-FLake was reduced quite significantly over the Great Lakes compared to that by CFS. This reduction was caused by suppressed rising motion due to increased stability in the lower atmosphere as a result of lowered surface heat and water fluxes. The results from this study indicate that local and mesoscale surface and atmospheric processes significantly affect regional climate forecasts, and the coupled CFS-FLake model will have a broader impact on climate and hydrology research and forecasts.

J	Fillios, M; Field, J; Charles, B				Fillios, Melanie; Field, Judith; Charles, Bethan			Investigating human and megafauna co-occurrence in Australian prehistory: Mode and causality in fossil accumulations at Cuddie Springs	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Human arrival in Sahul - Pleistocene Australia and New Guinea - has long been argued as the catalyst in the decline and disappearance of a suite of extinct animals referred to as megafauna. The debate concerning causality in Sahul is highly polarised, with climate change often cited as the alternative explanatory model. On continental Australia, there are few datasets available with which to explore the likely processes leading to the extinction events. At the present time, there is one site in New Guinea (Nombe Rockshelter) and one on continental Australia (Cuddie Springs) where the coexistence and temporal overlap of humans and megafauna has been identified. The Cuddie Springs Pleistocene archaeological site in southeastern Australia contains an association of fossil extinct and extant fauna with an archaeological record through two sequential stratigraphic units dating from c. 36 to c. 30 ka ago. A taphonomic study of the fossil fauna has revealed an accumulation of bone in a primary depositional context, consistent with a waterhole death assemblage. Overall the faunal assemblage studied here (n: 8146: NISP: 1355) has yielded little direct evidence of carnivore damage or human activities. Post depositional factors such as physical destruction incurred by trampling, compaction of sediments, and/or the hydrological status of the lake at that time have played important roles. As the only known site on continental Australia where megafauna, and humans co-occur, the Cuddie Springs faunal assemblage yields equivocal evidence for a significant human role in the accumulation of the fauna here. At the present time there is no evidential basis to the argument that humans had a primary role in the extinction of the Australian megafauna. The first colonisers are likely to have preyed upon those few species known to have persisted to this time, but their impact may have been restricted to the tail end of a process that had been underway for millennia prior to human arrival.

In this study, we aimed to determine the common sources of origin of 17 metals and other elements in the liver of white-tailed eagles, and to compare the variations in their hepatic concentrations by age (adults vs immatures) and sex (males vs females) in groups of white-tailed eagles wintering in Eastern Poland. The element concentrations followed the pattern of S > K > Na > Fe > Mg > Ca > Zn > Cu > Mn > Se > Pb > Hg > Cd > Cr > Sr > V > Sc. We found significant age-related differences in the hepatic concentrations of some of the elements. Adults showed higher concentrations of Pb, Cd, Ca, Fe, and Zn and lower concentrations of Cu and Se than immatures. These differences may be explained by age-related differences in wintering strategy (adults are sedentary, and immatures are migratory) and hunting skills (adults are more successful when hunting for agile prey). Our study indicates that ingested Pb ammunition poses a serious threat to the health and lives of white-tailed eagles in Poland (32% of the studied individuals had acute lead poisoning). Our study also indicates a serious need for banning the use of lead hunting ammunition in the parts of Europe (including Poland) where it is still allowed.

A thorough understanding of N runoff losses is necessary for optimal N management in vegetable production systems. A 3-year field experiment was conducted at a Chinese cabbage field in the Taihu Lake Basin of China to evaluate the characteristics of N runoff losses and the effect of different N fertilizer treatments on N runoff losses during the autumn and winter, 2010-2012. The results demonstrated that surface runoff was significantly and positively related to rainfall. The highest risk of N runoff loss occurred one week after fertilization, and top dressing increased this risk. NO3-- N was the main runoff component, accounting for 49.32-71.82% of the total N losses. The concentration of NO3--N was significantly and positively related to the concentration of total N in the runoff. Significant differences in N runoff losses were observed between N fertilizer treatments. N runoff losses from conventional fertilizer were 10.43-22.68 kg ha(-1), significantly higher than from other treatments, and the total N net runoff loss rates for conventional fertilizer treatment were 3.48-7.56%. The application of organic fertilizer reduced N runoff loss by 15.70-18.14% compared to conventional fertilizer application. Organic-inorganic compound fertilizer reduced N runoff loss by 27.37-36.27% compared with conventional fertilizer. Slow-release fertilizers had very significant positive effects in controlling N runoff loss, with a 58.29-61.01% reduction for sulfur-coated urea, a 49.33-56.05% reduction for biological carbon power urea, and a 59.79-63.59% reduction for bulk-blend controlled-release fertilizer relative to conventional fertilizer. This study provides vital baseline information for fertilizer choice and management practices, which can be used to reduce N runoff losses and encourage the development of new fertilizer strategies for vegetable planting.

J	Dodson, SI				Dodson, Stanley I.			Biodiversity in southern Wisconsin storm-water retention ponds: Correlations with watershed cover and productivity	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												This research is based on the management principle that watershed land cover is a better predictor of pond biodiversity than primary productivity. Ponds in watersheds with more than 30% lawn cover have few zooplankton species, no macrophytes, no snails, and no amphibians. A recent meta-analysis generated the hypothesis that watershed (catchment basin) land cover is a better predictor of lake biodiversity than traditional predictors (such as in-lake primary productivity) if the watershed includes human development (agriculture, residential, or urban). This hypothesis was tested via a field survey of 23 similar-sized artificial ponds in southern Wisconsin. The ponds had similar climate and geology, but differed in the relative proportions of land cover in the watershed. Twelve environmental variables (including pond area, depth, and primary productivity surrogates) and seven watershed land cover variables were correlated with biodiversity measures of seven major aquatic communities. Percent lawn cover was negatively correlated with zooplankton richness (r(2) = 0.41), macrophyte abundance (r(2) = 61), molluscan presence (r(2) = 0.48), and amphibian presence (r(2) = 0.55 for spring species and r(2) = 0.78 for summer species). Fish presence was negatively correlated with percent watershed covered by meadow (r(2) = 0.16). Chlorophyll a (a primary productivity surrogate) was negatively correlated with three groups: zooplankton richness (r(2) = 0.18), macrophyte abundance (r(2) = 0.23), and molluscan presence/absence (r(2) = 0.31). Total phosphorus and nitrogen (surrogates of in-lake primary productivity) were weakly correlated with biodiversity.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2008	24	4					370	380		10.1080/07438140809354847	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140809354847													WOS:000269666900008
J	Camur, MZ; Yazicigil, H; Altinbilek, DH				Camur, MZ; Yazicigil, H; Altinbilek, DH			Hydrogeochemical modeling of waters in Mogan and Eymir lakes special environmental protection area, Ankara, Turkey	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												On the basis of water-rock interactions, hydrogeochemical characteristics of spring, stream, wetland, and lake waters in the Mogan and Eymir Lakes special environmental protection area of Turkey were modeled using a reaction-path simulation method. Geochemical characteristics of surface waters, mineralogical sources of ion concentrations in the springs, mixing, and evaporation/dilution relationships between the compositions of input flows and the lakes and between the compositions of inflows and wetlands were quantitatively determined. Major ion distributions in spring water reflect mineralogical characteristics of the lithologies that have been traversed by related springs before reaching the surface. Mixing and evaporation/dilution calculations show that approximately 41 to 83% of the ion concentrations in the Mogan Lake is provided by groundwater and the remaining is supplied by streams. In addition to the mixing, cation exchange and carbon dioxide (CO2) outgasing reactions are also required to obtain the observed lake composition. Chemistry of the wetland waters provided by Mogan Lake by way of groundwater and the regulator canal is primarily controlled by CO2 ingasing and exchange reactions. Small amounts of dilution by other sources are also required. The majority of ion concentrations in Eymir Lake water, on the other hand, is supplied by the wetland area. Ion concentration contributions of groundwater from other areas to the Eymir Lake are calculated to be approximately 8 to 59% of the total input. Silica precipitation, exchange, and evaporation are the effective processes in the production of Eymir Lake water concentrations. In general, the ranges of model results are consistent with those of hydrological data.					, Hasan/AAT-2055-2021; Çamur, Mehmet/AAZ-6532-2020														1061-4303					SEP-OCT	1997	69	6					1144	1153		10.2175/106143097X125894	http://dx.doi.org/10.2175/106143097X125894													WOS:A1997XX85600013

However, the nature and timing of this shift remains uncertain due to the discontinuous nature and/or coarse resolution of many ENSO proxies, as well as a lack of agreement between previously published records. A new, continuous, climate record from El Junco Crater Lake in the Galdpagos Islands reveals several abrupt changes in lake level and precipitation through the Holocene. Hydroclimatic model simulations suggest that El Junco lake level responds sensitively to increases in precipitation associated with El Nino events, rising during wet El Nino events and falling during the intervening dry periods. Grain size data from El Junco sediment cores indicate past lake level variability, likely associated with changing seasonal precipitation and ENSO frequency. The grain size data suggest increased precipitation intensity prior to 9000+/-120 cal years BP, and after 4200+/-130 cal years BR as well as a two-step increase in precipitation at 3200+/-160 and 2000+/-100 cal years BP. Maximum Holocene precipitation and inferred ENSO variability occurred between 2000+/-100 and 1500+/-70 cal years BP, during the same period that six other independent proxy records suggest higher ENSO frequency and longer, stronger El Nino events. Decreasing sediment carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratios in El Junco sediments indicate rising lake levels from the early Holocene to present, corroborating the grain size data. The inferred increase in precipitation at 4200+/-130 cal years BP and at 2000 +/- 100 cal years BP coincides with decreasing Southwest Asian and East Asian Monsoon intensity, suggesting tropical Pacific climate and the Asian monsoon were interconnected systems at centennial to millennial timescales during the Holocene. A weakening trend in the Asian monsoon and the trend toward wetter conditions at El Junco also coincide with a trend toward cooler and drier conditions inferred from Cariaco Basin sediment proxies from the mid-Holocene to present, suggesting the migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) likely influenced hydrological changes in both the eastern tropical Pacific and the Asian Monsoon region during the Holocene.

The environmental parameters, epilithic biomass and epilithic diversity were qualitatively and quantitatively assessed. Our results showed that faster biomasses peaks (40-50 days colonization) were achieved at Gusheng where nutrient level was higher, comparing with that of Xiahe. A 10-day incubation period is a dividing line from an initial successional stage to the following stage during epilithon succession. The epilithic biomass and biodiversity exhibited distinctly spatial-temporal characteristics, showing higher values at the site being affected by human activities than that being under the natural condition. The spatial characteristic was associated with nitrate enrichment (the most important), and the positively biological responses of the epilithon (higher biomass and diversity) to nitrate enrichment highlight the occurrence of non-point-source pollution on the west bank of Erhai Lake. The temporal characteristic was associated with water temperature (the second important), exhibiting a high biomass accumulation in winter compared with that in summer. This may be caused by other biotic factors not measured in this study, therefore, a detailed investigation regarding the interactions among biotic components in Erhai Lake is essentially needed.

To investigate this relationship, a complete record of paleofloods, regional glacier length changes (and associated climate phases) and regional glacier advances and retreats (and associated climate transitions) are derived from the varved sediments of Lake Silvaplana (ca. 1450 BC-AD 420; Upper Engadine, Switzerland). In combination, these records provide insight into the behavior of floods (i.e. frequency) under a wide range of climate conditions. Eighty-five paleofloods are identified from turbidites in the sediments of Lake Silvaplana. Regional glacier length changes (and associated cool and/or wet and warm and/or dry climate phases) are inferred from centennial anomalies in the square root of low-pass (LP) filtered Mass Accumulation Rates (MAR(LP)(1/2)). Regional glacier advances and retreats (and associated cooling and/or wetting and warming and/or drying climate transitions) are inferred from centennial trends in MAR. This is the first continuous record of glacier length changes in the Lake Silvaplana catchment for this time period. These data agree with regional records of land-use, glacier activity and lake levels. More frequent turbidites are found during cool and/or wet phases of ca. 1450 BC to AD 420. However, no relationship to climate transitions is discerned. Consistently, June-July-August (JJA) temperatures dating ca. 570 BC-AD 120 are inversely correlated to the frequency of turbidites. The rate that turbidite frequency increases with cooler BA temperatures is not linear. Finally, 130 analogues for a 21st century climate in the Alps between ca. 570 BC-AD 120 (i.e. 50 year windows with a warming trend and average JJA temperature exceeding AD 1950-AD 2000 values from nearby meteo station Sils Maria) are considered.

Anthropogenic water bodies as drought refuge for aquatic macroinvertebrates and macrophytes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Ecological research associated with the importance of refuges has tended to focus on natural rather than anthropogenic water bodies. The frequency of disturbances, including drought events, is predicted to increase in many regions worldwide due to human-induced climate change. More frequent disturbance will affect freshwater ecosystems by altering hydrologic regimes, water chemistry, available habitat and assemblage structure. Under this scenario, many aquatic biota are likely to rely on permanent water bodies as refuge, including anthropogenic water bodies. Here, macroinvertebrate and macrophyte assemblages from waste-water treatment and raw-water storages (i.e. untreated potable water) were compared with nearby natural water bodies during autumn and winter 2013. We expected macroinvertebrate and macrophyte assemblages in raw-water storages to be representative of natural water bodies, while waste-water treatment storages would not, due to degraded water quality. However, water quality in natural water bodies differed from raw-water storages but was similar to waste-water treatment storages. Macroinvertebrate patterns matched those of water quality, with no differences occurring between natural water bodies and waste-water treatment storages, but assemblages in raw-water storages differed from the other two water bodies. Unexpectedly, differences associated with raw-water storages were attributable to low abundances of several taxa. Macrophyte assemblages in raw-water storages were representative of natural water bodies, but were less diverse and abundant in, or absent from, waste-water treatment storages. No clear correlations existed between any habitat variables and macroinvertebrate assemblages but a significant correlation between macrophyte assemblages and habitat characteristics existed. Thus, there were similarities in both water quality and macroinvertebrate assemblages between natural water bodies and waste-water treatment storages, and similarities in macrophyte assemblages between raw-water storages and natural water bodies. These similarities illustrate that anthropogenic water storages support representative populations of someaquatic biota across the landscape, and thus, may provide important refuge following disturbance where dispersal capabilities allow.

J	Titze, D; Austin, J				Titze, Daniel; Austin, Jay			Novel, direct observations of ice on Lake Superior during the high ice coverage of winter 2013-2014	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												During the 2013-2014 winter, the Lake Superior basin experienced record-low air temperatures and record-high ice cover. We present observations from three subsurface moorings which provided a novel view of the ice cover during this extreme winter. Each mooring carried a set of thermistors, and two sites had ADCPs, providing a rare glimpse into the subsurface characteristics and behavior of a large, partially ice-covered lake, including ice drift velocity, keel size and abundance, surface gravity wave suppression, and passive acoustics below the ice sheet. Ice drift velocities were well correlated with nearby wind velocities, with ice speeds approximately 4% of the wind speed and 20 to the right of the wind direction. Passing ice keels displaced the top subsurface float at the western mooring to depths of 6 m on a regular basis, and up to 11 m during one event. Anomalously large signal return strength at two ADCPs occurred sporadically at roughly the same time at two geographically separate locations, but only during periods of ice cover. The distribution of signal strength with depth suggests that these events are actually sounds from the ice cover itself, rather than reflectors in the water. Broadly speaking, ice cover on Lake Superior has more in common with oceanic ice cover than with ice cover on small lakes. (C) 2016 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

J	Lafrenèire, M; Sharp, M				Lafrenèire, M; Sharp, M			Wavelet analysis of inter-annual variability in the runoff regimes of glacial and nival stream catchments, Bow Lake, Alberta	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Continuous wavelet analyses of hourly time series of air temperature, stream discharge, and precipitation are used to compare the seasonal and inter-annual variability in hydrological regimes of the two principal streams feeding Bow Lake, Banff National Park, Alberta: the glacial stream draining the Wapta Icefields, and the snowmelt-fed Bow River. The goal is to understand how water sources and flow routing differ between the two catchments. Wavelet spectra and cross-wavelet spectra were determined for air temperature and discharge from the two streams for summers (June-September) 1997-2000, and for rainfall and discharge for the summers of 1999 and 2000. The diurnal signal of the glacial runoff was orders of magnitude higher in 1998 than in other years, indicating that significant ice exposure and the development of channelized glacial drainage occurred as a result of the 1997-98 El Nino conditions. Early retreat of the snowpack in 1997 and 1998 led to a significant summer-long input of melt runoff from a small area of ice cover in the Bow River catchment; but such inputs were not apparent in 1999 and 2000, when snow cover was more extensive. Rainfall had a stronger influence on runoff and followed quicker flow paths in the Bow River catchment than in the glacial catchment. Snowpack thickness and catchment size were the primary controls on the phase relationship between temperature and discharge at diurnal time scales. Wavelet analysis is a fast and effective means to characterize runoff, temperature, and precipitation regimes and their interrelationships and inter-annual variability. The technique is effective at identifying inter-annual and seasonal changes in the relative contributions of different water sources to runoff, and changes in the time required for routing of diurnal meltwater pulses through a catchment. However, it is less effective at identifying changes/differences in the type of the flow routing (e.g. overland flow versus through flow) between or within catchments.

P. An identical but antiphased pattern is also evident in two stalagmite records from eastern Brazil, indicating that the South American Summer Monsoon was intensified during the 8.2 kyr B. P. event. These records demonstrate that the event was of global extent and synchronous within dating errors of <50 years. In comparison with recent model simulations, it is plausible that the 8.2 kyr B. P. event can be tied in changes of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation triggered by a glacial lake draining event. This, in turn, affected North Atlantic climate and latitudinal position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, resulting in the observed low-latitude monsoonal precipitation patterns.

J	Das, S; Jana, BB				Das, S; Jana, BB			Distribution pattern of ambient cadmium in wetland ponds distributed along an industrial complex	CHEMOSPHERE												Water and sediment samples collected from 18 wetland ponds within and outside industrial areas were examined for cadmium concentration and water quality parameters during the period of January to July 1996. The Cd contents in gill, liver, mantle and shell of freshwater mussel (Lamellidens marginalis) as well as leaves and roots of water hyacinth Eichhornia those occurred in these ponds were also estimated. Cd concentration ranged from 0.006 to 0.7025 mg/l in water and from 7 to 77 mug/g dw in sediments of all the ponds investigated. The amount of Cd occurring in water and sediment was much higher in concentrations in the ponds located in Captain Bheri and Mudiali farm close to industrial areas, compared to remaining ponds located outside the industrial belt. Lamellidens marginalis procured from Mudiali and Captain Bheri ponds showed regardless of size, tissue and season of collection significantly higher Cd concentration than did those from other ponds. Likewise, tissue Cd in Eichhornia collected from Mudiali pond was as high as 125-152 mug/g dw in root and 21-63 mug/g dw in leaves compared to 40-108 mug/g dw in root and 9-43 mug/g dw in leaves in the remaining ponds. Seasonal variability of Cd was clear-cut; the concentration was relatively higher in water and sediment in all ponds during summer than during monsoon season or winter. Size-wise, smaller groups showed the highest concentrations of Cd in all tissues of Lamellidens compared with medium and large size groups. Concentration factor for all tissues of Lamellidens regardless of size and season, was inversely proportional with the ambient Cd concentrations. Concentration factor estimated for all tissues in all ponds and all seasons was in the order: liver > gill > shell > mantle. As all ponds located outside the industrial belt showed Cd concentrations ranging from 0.006 to 0.049 mg/l, it is suggested that these wetlands do not pose serious risk to the environment.

J	HENNY, CJ; HERRON, GB				HENNY, CJ; HERRON, GB			DDE, SELENIUM, MERCURY, AND WHITE-FACED IBIS REPRODUCTION AT CARSON LAKE, NEVADA	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												We studied organochlorine, mercury (Hg), and selenium (Se) contamination in white-faced ibis (Plegadis chihi) nesting at Carson Lake, Nevada, in 1985 and 1986. Dichloro diphenyl dichloroethylene (DDE) was related to fewer young produced/nesting attempt (P = 0.0001), fewer young produced/successful nest (P = 0.0075), and eggshell thinning (P = 0.0001). As DDE in eggs increased to > 4 ppm (wet wt), and especially > 8 ppm, productivity decreased significantly (P .ltoreq. 0.05) and the incidence of cracked eggs increased. Assuming that 4 ppm DDE is the critical residue level, 40% of the nesting population in 1985 and 1986 was adversely impacted by DDE, with a net loss of 20% of the population''s expected production (to about 10 days old). Most eggs containing exceptionally high DDE levels (8-29 ppm) also had substantial amounts of dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane (DDT), which implies recently-used DDT as the source. No evidence of breeding ground DDE-DDT contamination was found. The white-faced ibis winter in Mexico, and mostly in the interior agricultural region. Concentrations of DDE-DDT in ibis eggs, unlike most other wading bird species from the Great Basin, did not decline during the last decade. Other organochlorine contaminants were generally low and detected in .ltoreq. 33% of the eggs. Selenium and Hg were accumulated by ibis on the Nevada breeding grounds, but concentrations in eggs did not reach levels sufficient to impact the production of 7-10 day old young. Potential Se and and especially Hg accumulation during the remainder of the summer was high, but actual effects on growing young and adults remain unknown.																			0022-541X	1937-2817				OCT	1989	53	4					1032	1045		10.2307/3809606	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3809606													WOS:A1989CD23400029

Protozoan samples were collected using glass slides from 1 and 2 m water depths at time intervals of 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28 days during winter and monsoon seasons. Thus, the colonization processes of protozoa were assigned into three stages namely the initial (3 days), transitional (7 days), and equilibrium stages (10-28 days) at two depths in two seasons. Regression analyses demonstrated that the colonization dynamics of protozoa were well fitted to the MacArthur-Wilson model and logistic equation. Species richness reached equilibrium after 10-14 days and species abundance was maximum at a depth of 1 m. These results suggest that samples of protozoa can be collected at 1 m depth in winter season for monitoring the ecological health of tropical marine ecosystems.					sharif, abu/ODM-1473-2025; Uddin, Aftab/AAA-8901-2021														0025-3154	1469-7769				SEP 7	2023	103								e62	10.1017/S0025315423000528	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0025315423000528													WOS:001060871100001

In particular, the isotopic composition of iron are useful proxies for reconstructing paleo-ocean environments. Yet, respective processes and related signatures are poorly constrained, hindering the reconstruction of iron redox mechanisms in the Archean ocean. This study centers on Sihailongwan Lake, a stratified water body with a euxinic lower water column considered as an Archean ocean analogue. Results show that the anaerobic oxidation layer is so different from other similar lakes in which dissolved Fe oxidation is present in redoxcline layer. And the fractionation factor between ferrous Fe and iron hydroxide observed in nature water body of Sihailongwan Lake reaches to 2.696o, which would benefit the production of the oxidations of BIF in sediment. By the spatial distribution of Fe isotope, the benthic water in autumn and the hypolimnetic anoxic water in spring has been identified as iron sulfide zone, where iron isotopic fractionation factor during iron sulfide formation is 1.1696o, accounting for partial scavenging of dissolved Fe(II) with an associated isotopic fractionation. However, pyrite in the sediment records the iron isotopic signal from the redoxcline but not in the iron sulfide or oxide zones of the water column. Above findings indicate that neither the iron isotope fractionation during partial transfer of ferrous iron to iron sulfide nor the partial oxidation of ferrous iron are recorded as pyrite in sedimentary rock. Importantly, the signal of Fe isotopic fractionation in water was archived in the suspended particulate matter and transferred into the sediment, rather than via ferrous iron directly deposited in the sediment. This study reveals that Fe isotopes from modern natural environments are useful proxies for reconstructing iron oxidation-reduction process during Earth's early history.

ALIGNMENT OF SALINE SPRINGS WITH EVAPORITE KARST STRUCTURES IN NORTHEAST ALBERTA, WESTERN CANADA: ANALOGUE FOR CRETACEOUS HYPOGENE BRINE SEEPS TO THE SURFACE	ACTA CARSOLOGICA												Meteoric and glacial meltwater charged groundwater, mixed with dissolved salts from Devonian sources at depth, discharged as saline springs along topographic lows of the Athabasca River Valley, which downcuts into the Cretaceous Athabasca oil sands deposit in northeast Alberta, western Canada. These Quaternary saline seeps have TDS measurements, isotope signatures and other chemical characteristics indicative of the groundwater flows coming in contact with Prairie Evaporite (M. Devonian) salt beds, 200 m below the surface. Migrations up-section of groundwater with dissolved chloride and sulphate salts occurred along salt dissolution collapse breccia zones that cross-cut Upper Devonian limestone strata. Seeps discharged along the karstic Devonian limestone paleotopography, the unconformity surface flooring the Lower Cretaceous McMurray Formation. Saline to brine springs along the Athabasca River Valley have TDS measurements that can exceed 100,000 mg/L. Quaternary salt removal was insignificant compared to the volwninous removal of the 80-130 m thick salt section for 1000s km(2) during the Early Cretaceous configuration of the Devonian paleotopography, which partially controlled depositional patterns of the overlying McMurray Formation, principal host rock of the Athabasca oil sands. Little is known of the storage or disposition of voluminous brines that would have resulted from this regional-scale removal of the salt beds below the Athabasca deposit during the Cordilleran configuration of the foreland Alberta Basin. Holocene dissolution trends and discharges at the surface as saline springs are proposed as a modern analogue for voluminous Early Cretaceous brine seeps to the surface along salt dissolution collapse breccia zones, concurrent with deposition of the McMurray Formation. This model links several characteristics of the McMurray Formation as responses to Aptian brine seeps to the surface. These include: (1) the emplacement of a drainage-line silcrete along the margins of the Assiniboia PaleoValley, now partially exhumed by the Athabasca River Valley, (2) distribution of brackish-water burrowing organisms, and (3) diagenesis of calcite-cemented sand intervals.																			0583-6050	1580-2612					2021	50	1					119	141		10.3986/ac.v50i1.8763	http://dx.doi.org/10.3986/ac.v50i1.8763													WOS:000658740200007
J	Bunte, C; Simon, M				Bunte, C; Simon, M			Bacterioplankton turnover of dissolved free monosaccharides in a mesotrophic lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Concentrations and bacterioplankton uptake of dissolved free monosaccharides (DFCHO) in relation to bacterioplankton production and phytoplankton biomass were studied in mesotrophic Lake Constance, Germany, from August 1995 to December 1996. Concentrations of total DFCHO, measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and pulsed amperometric detection, ranged from <20 to 440 nM and exhibited pronounced spatiotemporal variations. Enhanced concentrations of DFCHO were often associated with the breakdown of phytoplankton blooms and periods of low phytoplankton growth. Bacterial uptake rates of DFCHO were also enhanced during such events, as well as at peaks of bacterioplankton production (BP). Ratios of uptake of DFCHO/BP, however, indicated that DFCHO concentrations were relatively more important as substrates during periods of low bacterial growth than during phases of intense bacterial growth. Ratios of bacterial uptake of DFCHO/BP from spring to fall ranged from 0.22 to 0.39 in the layer 0-10 m, from 0.17 to 0.56 at 20 m, and from 0.22 to 0.46 at 50 m, respectively. Glucose, galactose, and mannose dominated the DI;CHO pool and constituted similar to 55 to similar to 70 mol%. The analysis of individual turnover times of five DFCHO concentrations from August to November 1995 at 3, 10, and 50 m revealed that the glucose pool turned over most rapidly, followed by galactose and mannose. Glucosamine and fructose always exhibited substantially longer turnover times. Comparisons to previous studies show that DFCHO concentrations are of similar significance for bacterioplankton growth as dissolved free amino acids (DFAA), even though temporal uptake patterns of both substrates are different.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				DEC	1999	44	8					1862	1870		10.4319/lo.1999.44.8.1862	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1999.44.8.1862													WOS:000084125600002

Vines grown over the tile lines grew well during 1997-99 following the excessively wet year of 1996. This was not the case for vines that were located between tile lines. It was postulated that by digging and refilling, the trench to insert the tile that either soil compaction or soil pH had been altered and could be responsible for the vine performance. Measurements indicated that these factors were not altered enough to explain the growth differences between vines growing over tile lines and those vines growing between tile lines. It appears that soil oxygen was improved by tiling and likely made the difference in cane dieback during the excessively wet year of 1996. By 1999, vines over tile and between tile had similar yields, and the pattern was no longer visible from the air. This study showed that heavy clay soils with naturally poor internal drainage caused cane dieback and poor growth of vines, especially in very wet years. Thus, it appears prudent on soils of this type, tile drainage is beneficial and spacing of lateral tile lines needs to be closer than 40 ft (12 in) in plateau silt loam soils to adequately protect vines from wet years.																			1063-0198					APR-JUN	2001	11	2					272	276		10.21273/HORTTECH.11.2.272	http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTTECH.11.2.272													WOS:000173927200023

Thus, considerable progress has been made toward understanding these short-term cooling events in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe and North America. However, few relevant studies have been conducted in coastal East Asia due to a lack of undisturbed sample materials appropriate for paleoclimate studies. In this study, we examined Holocene abrupt drying events and the Holocene climate optimum (HCO) based on a new high-resolution multi-proxy record (pollen, mean grain size, total organic carbon, carbon/ nitrogen ratio) from the south coast of Korea. Possible cultural impacts of the events were also explored using summed probability distributions (SPDs) of archaeological radiocarbon dates. Our arboreal pollen percentage (AP) data clearly indicated drying events centered at 9.8 ka, 9.2 ka, 8.2 ka, 4.7 ka, 4.2 ka, 3.7 ka, 3.2 ka, 2.8 ka, and 2.4 ka BP. The AP data also indicated that forests were severely damaged by a two-step successive drying event during the period from 8.4 ka to 8 ka BP and that the HCO lasted from ca. 7.6 ka to ca. 4.8 ka BP. According to the results of a correlation analysis, climate variations on the Korean peninsula were possibly controlled by shifts in western tropical Pacific (WTP) sea surface temperatures during the past similar to 5500 years. Simultaneous declines in the SPDs and AP from 2.8 ka to 2.3 ka BP may reflect a demographic reduction attributable to rapid climate deterioration on the peninsula. Refugee agriculturalists might have immigrated to Japan and developed the Yayoi culture. In this study, the 2.8 ka event and its societal impact are recognized clearly for the first time in coastal East Asia.

J	Henry, SD; Barkley, SW; Johnson, RL				Henry, SD; Barkley, SW; Johnson, RL			Exploitation of Nile tilapia in a closed-system public fishing reservoir in northern Arkansas	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus have been stocked as a forage species annually since 2001 in Lake Hogue, a 101-ha, closed-system public fishing reservoir in northeastern Arkansas. A mail-in reward tag study was implemented in 2003 to determine total estimated harvest, contribution of Nile tilapia to the lake's fishery, and impact of angler harvest on Nile tilapia reproduction. Estimates of harvest were corrected for tag loss (1.1%), tag-induced mortality (1.0%), and nonreporting of tags by anglers (53% reporting rate). Angler-hours were compared between anglers targeting Nile tilapia and those targeting other species. Anglers harvested an estimated 83% of the stocked Nile tilapia (56% of stocked fish were captured by traditional panfishing techniques; 27% were captured by use of dip nets during the winter die-off in late November). Anglers targeting primarily Nile tilapia fished significantly longer (5.7 h/angler) than individuals who incidentally caught Nile tilapia while fishing for other species (4.5 h/angler). Analysis of the economic impact of stocking Nile tilapia demonstrated a benefit-cost ratio of 0.38. Harvest of Nile tilapia did not apparently interfere with the management goal of using the fish as a forage species for game fishes. Tag return data strongly suggested that at midday during the hot summer months, when fishing pressure had traditionally been low, anglers targeted Nile tilapia in favor of the traditional target species (e.g., bluegill Lepomis macrochirus and redear sunfish L. microlophus).																			0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG	2005	25	3					853	860		10.1577/M04-084.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M04-084.1													WOS:000231336800012

It is of great value to evaluate the habitat vulnerabilities within more precise intervals of water levels and quantitatively assess the influences of water level changes. The findings are advantageous for managing wetland ecosystems and for migratory bird habitat protection. This study identified the ideal habitats for wintering Siberian cranes in Poyang Lake wetland within 1-meter water level intervals (from 5 to 16 m) based on the Landsat thematic mapper (TM), enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+), and operational land imager (OLI) remote sensing images taken on multiple dates in the past 30 years. Three indicators-sustainability, stability, and variety-were used to evaluate the vulnerabilities of crane habitats within various water level intervals; the spatial variations and distribution patterns of the habitat vulnerabilities were further explored. The explanatory powers of water level intervals (and others) and their paired interactive effects on the habitat vulnerabilities were quantified using the geographical detector method. The results showed that crane habitat vulnerabilities were significantly sensitive to the water level changes of Poyang Lake; the habitat vulnerabilities and their spatial distribution patterns both exhibited specific tendencies with water level increases. A water level of 12 m was identified as the potential upper threshold for the maintenance of sustainable crane habitats and a water level interval of 9-10 m was expected to be the optimal interval for facilitating the aggregation features of crane habitats. The water level interval was identified as the most dominant factor in habitat vulnerability. It explained 14.46%, 42.89%, and 21.78% of the sustainability, stability, and variety of crane habitats; the numbers were expected to increase to 22%, 49.25%, and 25.84%, respectively, with water level intervals interacting with other factors. This article provides a novel perspective in evaluating the habitat vulnerabilities of wintering migratory birds and quantifying the responses to water level changes in wetlands; the proposed approaches are applicable and practicable for habitat vulnerability assessments of other wintering birds in other typical wetlands.					; Yin, Qian/HGU-0672-2022	meng, yu/0000-0002-0595-3439; Zuo, Lijun/0000-0001-6554-0815; Hu, Bisong/0000-0003-3875-8792; Yin, Qian/0000-0001-9199-9945														2072-4292				JUN	2022	14	12							2774	10.3390/rs14122774	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14122774													WOS:000816505700001
J	Shearer, RC; Asebrook, JM				Shearer, RC; Asebrook, JM			Restoring conifers by natural regeneration on slopes exposed during highway reconstruction, Glacier National Park, Montana, USA	FORESTRY												In 1991, about 70 years after construction, the 16-km Lake McDonald section of the Going-to-the-Sun Road in Glacier National Park was rebuilt. The road, which is at the base of steep north-west-facing slopes, follows the 975 m contour above Lake McDonald within forests originating after wildfires. Tree composition is mostly western red cedar (Thuja plicata Don ex D. Don) and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.) with a minor component of six other conifer species. Trees were expected to disperse enough seeds to naturally regenerate road cuts on four land-types with developed soils, but not on the fifth land-type with rock and scree. From 1987 to 1995, red cedar and hemlock dispersed 4466 potentially viable (filled) seeds m(-2) on cut slopes while other species added 74 filled seeds m(-2). From 1991 to 1995, after reconstruction, an average of 3294 filled red cedar seeds fell m(-2), in addition to 511 western hemlock m(-2) and 61 m(-2) for six other species. On cut slopes from 1992 to 1998, of land-types with developed soils, seeds germinated after snowmelt, usually from early May until the surface dried. Almost no seeds germinated and no seedlings survived on the rock/scree land-type. Due to the harsh environment on cut slopes, most seedlings died. In spring 1999, red cedar and hemlock seedlings were small and inconspicuous and required an average of 312 and 173 filled seeds for each surviving seedling.																			0015-752X						2003	76	2					199	207		10.1093/forestry/76.2.199	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/forestry/76.2.199													WOS:000182630000009

Four thermophilous (warm-demanding) and four psychrophilous (cold-tolerant) bat species, mainly forest dwellers, were selected for the study. Myotis blythii is the oldest bat species recorded in the Alps, i.e. on the southern side, going back to the early Holocene at 10 500 cal. BP. Our study showed that thermophilous species (e.g. Myotis bechsteinii and Rhinolophus hipposideros) were most abundant during the Holocene climatic optimum in Central Europe (10 000-4000 cal. BP), when warm-demanding mixed forests were dominant. Psychrophilous species such as Myotis brandtii also occurred during the climatic optimum, but most of the samples fall into the onset of the late Holocene (Sub-Atlantic period), when summer temperatures were already declining. These species declined in the southern Alps after 4000 cal. BP, when fire was intensively used by humans to convert portions of the forest into open land. This fire practice modified forest species composition and structure, with effects on forest-dwelling bat communities. We conclude that during the early and mid Holocene bat community compositions mainly depended on climate and related vegetation and forest structure dynamics. With increasing land use during the mid and late Holocene, anthropogenic changes of forest composition and creation of open habitats increasingly co-determined bat-population dynamics in the Alps. These Swiss findings are in agreement with previous results from eastern Central Europe.

Influences of Human and Livestock Density on Winter Habitat Selection of Mongolian Gazelle (Procapra gutturosa)	ZOOLOGICAL SCIENCE												Human and livestock related disturbances of habitat selection by ungulates are topics of global concern, as they have profound impacts on ungulate survival, population density, fitness, and management; however, differences in ungulate habitat use under different human and livestock densities are not fully understood. Mongolian gazelle (Procapra gutturosa), an endemic ungulate species on the Asia-European steppe, faces varying intensities of human and livestock disturbances in the area around Dalai Lake, China. To investigate how habitat selection strategies vary as disturbance intensity changes, we randomly set 20 transects containing 1486 plots, on which we conducted repeated surveys of 21 ecological factors during the winters in the period of 2005-2008. We aimed to: 1) determine the critical factors underlying habitat selection of the gazelles; 2) determine the gazelles' habitat preferences in this area; 3) determine how habitat selection varies with disturbance intensity and explore the primary underlying mechanism. We used binary-logistic regressions and information theoretic approaches to build best-fit habitat selection models, and calculated resource selection functions. Sixty-six herds, 522 individuals, and 499 tracks were recorded. Our results indicate that snow depth and aboveground biomass are the main factors affecting habitat selection by Mongolian gazelle throughout the district in winter. Thin snow cover and abundant aboveground biomass are preferred. Avoiding disturbance was the primary factor accounting for habitat selection in low disturbance areas, although with increasing human or live-stock-related disturbance, gazelle maintained a reduced distance to the source of the disturbance. Presumably owing to that shift, movement costs were more important as disturbance increased. In addition, Mongolian gazelle selected habitats based on topographical features promoting greater visibility where disturbance was lower. We suggest several management implications of our findings for this ungulate species will contribute to the effective conservation of Mongolian gazelle in the Dalai Lake area.

J	Brodersen, KP; Lindegaard, C				Brodersen, KP; Lindegaard, C			Mass occurrence and sporadic distribution of Corynocera ambigua Zetterstedt (Diptera, Chironomidae) in Danish lakes. Neo- and palaeolimnological records	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The chironomid Corynocera ambigua (Tanytarsini) is commonly reported as a cold-stenothermal species living in shallow lakes in arctic and subarctic regions. In palaeoecological studies of temperate lakes, larval remains of C. ambigua are usually found in late-glacial sediments from the Allerod and Younger Dryas periods, and often in association with subfossil Chara oospores. During a surface sampling program of chironomid head-capsules in 41 Danish temperate lakes, C. ambigua was found to comprise 25% of the chironomid assemblages in two lakes, and was sporadically found in 8 other lakes (0.5-10%). A 70 cm palaeo-stratigraphy from the shallow (max depth 1.2 m) and eutrophic (total phosphorus = 150 mu g P l(-1)) Lake Stigsholm showed that C. ambigua has been abundant in the last 4-5 centuries. At a sediment level of 25 cm (year 1925, Pb-210 dating), C. ambigua began to decrease in frequency while Chironomus plumosus, Procladius sp., Cladotanytarsus gr. mancus and Tanytarsus spp. increased, suggesting an increased nutrient loading and an approach to eutrophic conditions. In 1995 C. ambigua was still very abundant in Lake Stigsholm but in early March 1997 no living larvae were found. An extremely heavy growth of Elodea, Enteromorpha and filamentous algae in the summers of 1995 and 1996, with following degradation in the fall, might have influenced the invertebrate population dynamics. No significant distinguishing characteristics were found for the lakes supporting C. ambigua. Its occurrence in warm (similar to 20 degrees C) Danish lakes brings into question the perception of the species as being cold-stenothermal.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				JUL	1999	22	1					41	52		10.1023/A:1008032619776	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008032619776													WOS:000081714800003

Multiple factors seem to disturb the aquatic life of Tampara Lake, especially fish. Chatrapur beach placers are rich in various heavy minerals including monazite, an ore of thorium, that emits high background radiations and can affect the biota. Run-offs from the monazite mining sites on the beach placers are also presumed to be carried to the lake. Tourism, local transportation, fishing activities, presence of heavy minerals and mining run-offs appear to disrupt the lake's ecosystem. The present work assessed the protein and lipid concentrations in the liver and muscle, nuclear abnormalities in the peripheral blood erythrocytes and histopathology of gills, liver, kidney, intestine and stomach of Channa punctata from Tampara Lake in summer, winter and rainy seasons. The study also documented the effects of thorium nitrate, a byproduct of monazite ore processing, on Channa punctata of non-monazite areas. Channa punctata from the Tampara lake had significantly lower protein and lipid content in the liver and muscle, nuclear deformities and micronuclei in the erythrocytes and deformities in the gill, kidney, liver, stomach and intestine relative to the fish from the non-monazite areas. Seasonal alterations were observed in the protein and lipid content of muscle and liver, gill and kidney structure. Fish from the non-monazite areas treated with sub-lethal concentrations of thorium nitrate showed a dosedependent response in the protein and lipid content of liver and muscle, erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities and histopathological aberrations. The present study provides evidence that Channa punctata from Tampara Lake have relatively low nutritional value compared to fish from undisturbed non-monazite areas and are probably distressed by the water contamination due to the presence of heavy minerals and anthropogenic interventions.

We determined fluxes using relationships among the concentration gradients and fluxes of water vapor (measured with fast-response sensors and eddy correlation) and measured gradients in Hg-0 (sampled with a multi-replicate, high-precision device). The contaminated soils consistently exhibited significant emission of Hg-0 to the atmosphere. Fluxes associated with winds from the primary source area ranged from similar to 10 to similar to 200 ng m(-2) h(-1), up to several orders of magnitude above background. Fluxes increased exponentially with soil temperature, yielding a temperature coefficient similar to nitrogen oxide (exp[(0.065 +/- 0.011)T-soil], for T-soil = 7-29 degrees C). These results provided confidence in the method for Hg-0 because the gradients and fluxes behaved predictably. Fluxes appear to be controlled by volatilization of existing contaminant elemental Hg plus reduction of Hg2+ to Hg-0 in soil solution. We modeled the emission from an area of contaminated soils within similar to 20-50 m of our site using the flux/soil temperature relationship and annual temperature data. The predicted hourly fluxes were within 30-40% of our measurements and scaled up to an annual Hg emission rate of similar to 800 mu g m(-2) y(-1) We estimate the magnitude of the Hg-0 emission from the 100-ha contaminated area to be on the order of 1-10 kg/y.

GEOBIOLOGY												Lacustrine carbonate chimneys are striking, metre-scale constructions. If these were bioinfluenced constructions, they could be priority targets in the search for early and extraterrestrial microbial life. However, there are questions over whether such chimneys are built on a geobiological framework or are solely abiotic geomorphological features produced by mixing of lake and spring waters. Here, we use correlative microscopy to show that microbes were living around Pleistocene Mono Lake carbonate chimneys during their growth. A plausible interpretation, in line with some recent works by others on other lacustrine carbonates, is that benthic cyanobacteria and their associated extracellular organic material (EOM) formed tubular biofilms around rising sublacustrine spring vent waters, binding calcium ions and trapping and binding detrital silicate sediment. Decay of these biofilms would locally have increased calcium and carbonate ion activity, inducing calcite precipitation on and around the biofilms. Early manganese carbonate mineralisation was directly associated with cell walls, potentially related to microbial activity though the precise mechanism remains to be elucidated. Much of the calcite crystal growth was likely abiotic, and no strong evidence for either authigenic silicate growth or a clay mineral precursor framework was observed. Nevertheless, it seems likely that the biofilms provided initial sites for calcite nucleation and encouraged the primary organised crystal growth. We suggest that the nano-, micro- and macroscale fabrics of these Pleistocene Mono Lake chimneys were affected by the presence of centimetre-thick tubular and vertically stacked calcifying microbial mats. Such carbonate chimneys represent a promising macroscale target in the exploration for ancient or extraterrestrial life.

J	STEVENSON, AC; BATTARBEE, RW				STEVENSON, AC; BATTARBEE, RW			PALEOECOLOGICAL AND DOCUMENTARY RECORDS OF RECENT ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE IN GARAET EL ICHKEUL - A SEASONALLY SALINE LAKE IN NW TUNISIA	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												A palaeoecological and documentary study of the RAMSAR site of Garaet el Ichkeul in NW Tunisia demonstrates that the ecology of the lake has undergone significant changes over the last 400-500 years. Pb-210 dating of short sediment cores from the lake shows a significant increase in sediment accumulation rates over the last 150 years. This is associated initially with an increase in agricultural intensity within the catchment by French settlers in the late 1800s. Subsequently, sediment accumulation rates increased further as a result of anthropogenic modifications to the course of the Oued Djoumine. Pollen evidence suggests that Potamogeton, the major food resource of wintering waterfowl, only became established in the lake in c. AD 1890. This establishment appears to be associated with changes to the hydrological regime of the adjoining Lac de Bizerte by construction of the Bizerte Ship canal in AD 1895. The current importance of Ichkeul for wintering waterfowl is probably a direct consequence of these anthropogenic modifications and the dramatic reduction in wetland areas in the Mahgreb over the last 100 years.

The features analyzed include the flow direction and apparent groundwater velocity, their relationship with Lake Girdev, and the effect of lithological and structural features on the groundwater circulation. The results of a fluorescein tracer test indicate that groundwater flows east-northeast and the apparent flow velocity ranges from 26.2 to 35.6 m h(-1) between the injection site and various observation points. Tritium data suggest that the water of Lake Girdev and groundwater are probably similar in age, and oxygen-18 isotope data indicate that water derived from Lake Girdev is the main source of recharge to the aquifer. The aquifer is fed not only by Lake Girdev but also by rainfall percolating through allochthonous limestones; together, these provide the discharge of springs in Elmali Polje. The permeability of the allochthonous limestone aquifer has been enhanced as a result of jointing and faulting.																			1431-2174					OCT	1999	7	5					483	489		10.1007/s100400050221	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s100400050221													WOS:000083504300008

The results showed that the floating bed with ryegrass had better removal rates on chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) of low-concentration wastewater than other groups at 60 days (P<0.05), and the removal rates were 53.0%, 83.3% and 61.1% respectively. At 90 days, cress has the best performance on removing 5day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) and turbidity (P<0.05), with a removal rate of 82.9% and 80.8%. The removal rates of BOD5, COD, TN and turbidity by ryegrass in high concentration wastewater were significantly higher than other treatments (P<0.05), which were 84.0%, 70.2%, 56.2% and 82.1% respectively. However, ryegrass had better stem height, root length and plant biomass production compared with cress and chicory. In conclusion, ryegrass was an optimal floating plant for purification of geese wastewater in winter and the optimal treatment time was 60 days. The regress has strong adaption for fluctuate concentrations of pollutants and is suitable for treatment of livestock and poultry wastewater in practice.

Development of an ice jam database and prediction tool for the Lower Red River	CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL												The Lower Red River in Manitoba regularly experiences springtime ice jam flooding, with the most severe events occurring between Lockport and Netley Lake. A database of ice jam events was developed through newspaper archives and historical stage data. Each event was given a severity rating from 1-5, based on the resulting ice jam flood. This facilitated an investigation of ice jam timing and frequency on this section of the Lower Red River and the development of a threshold-based ice jam prediction tool. Out of 54 ice jam events from 1962-2017, all ice jam events occurred when the peak spring flow exceeded 1000 cms and all severe events (severity 3+) occurred when peak spring flows exceeded 1500 cms. The threshold ice jam prediction model was developed using five meteorological and hydrometric parameters including accumulated degree day of thaw, accumulated degree day of freezing, freeze-up water level, snow on ground, and rain equivalence. The model was able to differentiate all severe event years from non-event years with only one false positive result. By gaining a better understanding of ice jamming in the area, this research provides an accessible prediction method that can help guide decisions related to the risk and severity of spring ice jamming.																			0701-1784	1918-1817				APR 3	2021	46	1-2					73	86		10.1080/07011784.2021.1898479	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07011784.2021.1898479		MAR 2021											WOS:000627716100001

Application of mercury stable isotopes to examine sources and hydrologic factors impacting mercury bioaccumulation and cycling in invertebrates of a model saline lake	WATER RESEARCH												Invertebrates, such as brine shrimp and brine flies, are key prey items for millions of resident and migratory birds that utilize saline lakes such as Great Salt Lake (GSL). Elevated methylmercury (MeHg) in invertebrate and waterfowl species of GSL has been assumed to be linked to elevated MeHg in GSL's anoxic Deep Brine Layer (DBL) where aqueous concentrations can exceed 30 ng/L. Here, we leverage mercury (Hg) concentration and stable isotope measurements on brine flies (Ephydra hians and Ephydra cinerea), brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana), and spider (western spotted orbweaver [Neoscona oaxacensis]) to examine temporal changes in Hg concentrations and sources during periods of DBL presence and absence. Mercury concentrations in brine flies were inversely correlated with lake level and directly correlated with salinity, possibly resulting from factors such as enhanced Hg bioaccumulation due to osmoregulatory stress and stunted growth and/or elevated salinities impacting composition, abundance, and Hg concentrations of food sources. DBL presence did not correspond to higher invertebrate Hg concentrations, highlighting that the DBL is not the primary source of MeHg to biota. Hg stable isotope signatures (Delta 199Hg and delta 202Hg) in brine shrimp varied seasonally and indicated greater cumulative photochemical Hg loss from the water column in late summer and fall months. Co-located brine fly and western spotted orbweaver samples show equivalent Delta 199Hg and delta 202Hg signatures, supporting Hg transfer from the aquatic to terrestrial food webs. Furthermore, Hg isotope results (Delta 200Hg) indicate that the majority of Hg accumulating in GSL invertebrates is of atmospheric origin. This study highlights temporal controls on Hg bioaccumulation within GSL, which will help assess Hg cycling within the system in response to management actions and declining lake levels.					; Johnson, William/G-7733-2011	Lopez, Samuel/0000-0002-3544-7465; Flucke, Laura/0009-0002-7335-6828; Johnson, William/0000-0003-3126-3877													0043-1354	1879-2448				SEP 15	2025	284								123946	10.1016/j.watres.2025.123946	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2025.123946								40499201					WOS:001509615100003

Water and surface sediment samples from 17 locations, including springs, tributaries and lakes, were analyzed for the content of 22 elements by high-resolution inductively coupled mass spectrometry. Principal component analysis of the collected data set showed that different springs and tributaries displayed distinct multielemental compositions, reflecting primarily the differences in their corresponding geological backgrounds. It was shown that the springs situated in the Upper and Middle Jurassic dolomite bedrock represented the main source of several trace elements, including some toxic metals (Cd, Zn, Ni and Tl), to the Plitvice Lakes system. The concentrations of most of the trace elements (Mn, Fe, Al, Cd, Zn, Cu, Ni, Pb, Co, Cr and Tl) showed decreasing spatial trends in the downstream direction, from sources to the lakes. Such a distribution was interpreted to be a consequence of an efficient removal of the dissolved elements in the lentic parts of the system, mainly by co-precipitation with authigenic calcite and Mn oxides. Nevertheless, most of the elements in the lake sediments were highly correlated with Al, which indicated their prevalent association with terrigenic material. It was shown that the multicascade system of the Plitvice Lakes had an enhanced autopurification efficiency regarding the elimination of most of the trace metals from the aqueous phase.					; Barešić, Jadranka/ABA-8529-2021; Fiket, Zeljka/J-4985-2019	Ahel, Marijan/0000-0001-6923-8461; 													1380-6165	1573-1421				JAN	2014	20	1					19	38		10.1007/s10498-013-9204-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10498-013-9204-9													WOS:000330974700002

Here, we obtained a record of sediment grain size from Tolbo Lake in western Mongolia to reconstruct changes in aeolian activity since similar to 14 ka. The results suggest that intensified aeolian activity in the late Holocene may mainly have been a response to stronger surface winds resulting from an increase in spring insolation and mountain snow. The stable weak aeolian activity appears to coincide with ice-rafting events in the North Atlantic during the middle Holocene and may be a response to warming at northern high latitudes, increased humidity and vegetation coverage in western Mongolia, indicating that dust from western Mongolia would possibly contribute minimally to dust deposition in Greenland during this period. This study will help understand the atmospheric dust emissions and transport processes in the earth system.

Here we reported a pollen record from Lake Alake, based on which the quantitative mean annual precipitation (PANN) was reconstructed. Herbaceous taxa of Cyperaceae, Poaceae, Chenopodiaceae, and Artemisia were dominant in Alake pollen assemblage whose variations were mainly affected by humidity changes. The precipitation was high in 7200-5400 cal. yr BP, followed by decreasing trends in 5000-3000 cal. yr BP, and obviously increased after 3000 cal. yr BP. The variations of PANN in the Alake record suggest that high precipitation in middle Holocene was primarily contributed by the ASM driven by orbital forcing of insolation. However, the rising trend of PANN during the late Holocene probably indicated the increased of non-monsoonal precipitation and highlighted the contribution from the Westerlies. Our results suggest that the variation of precipitation transported by Westerlies might have reduced the seasonal variability of precipitation and contributed to the long-term wetting trend on the northeastern TP during the late Holocene.					凯, 李/KWU-0203-2024; Han, Li-Feng/J-1742-2019; Ni, Jian/I-7067-2012	Li, Kai/0000-0002-6197-4082; Liao, Mengna/0000-0002-1571-4116; Ni, Jian/0000-0001-5411-7050													0341-8162	1872-6887				DEC	2023	233								107521	10.1016/j.catena.2023.107521	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2023.107521													WOS:001150081200001
J	Dellali, M; Romeo, M; Aissa, P				Dellali, M; Romeo, M; Aissa, P			Annual variations of catalase activity in mussels and clams from Lake Bizerte	OCEANOLOGICA ACTA												The variations of catalase activity, which is a biochemical biomarker of exposure to an oxidative stress, were followed month by month (from May 1998 to May 1999) in Mediterranean clams (Ruditapes decussatus) collected at three stations (J, A and F), and mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) collected at two stations (J and C) in Lake Bizerte (Tunisia). Several oceanographic parameters were measured together with catalase activity in the animals to evaluate the quality of waters in the lake. Whatever the station taken into consideration, catalase activity in clams significantly varied as a function of the season, with marked increases in September, when the quality of waters was poor. Clams originating from station A presented the highest mean activity (147.27 +/- 10.69 mu mol min(-1) mg(-1) proteins), those from J had the most fluctuating monthly activity with a minimum of 68.98 mu mol min(-1) mg(-1) proteins (April 1999) and a maximum of 189.32 mu mol min(-1) mg-' proteins (September 1998). In mussels, the response of the anti-oxidant activity was comparable to that observed with clams. Monthly catalase activity was generally high in summer. This seasonal increase was especially significant in mussels from station J, which is submitted to a hyper-eutrophication phenomenon in summer. Catalase activity in mussels originating from station C, fairly constant throughout the year, varied in the range 64.23 mu mol min(-1) mg(-1) proteins (June) to 83.54 mu mol min(-1) mg(-1) proteins (September). The level of dissolved oxygen, negatively and significantly correlated with temperature, reached a minimum in summer. These environmental factors may, thus, exert an influence upon catalase activity measured in bivalves from the Lake Bizerte. (C) 2001 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

The largest mean annual surface velocities ranged from similar to 400 to 700 m a(-1), but velocities in the similar to 100-200 m a(-1) range were common. Summer velocities were up to an order of magnitude larger than annually averaged velocities. The highest velocity (similar to 1530 m a(-1)) was measured on the floating tongue of Lake Tuborg Glacier between 19 July and 19 August 2001. Calving rates from individual glaciers varied by up to a factor of two between successive years. Summer calving rates were similar to 2-8 times larger than annual average rates. The average ratio of the calving flux due to terminus-volume change to that due to ice flow through the glacier terminus was similar to 0.81 for the annual rates and similar to 1.71 for summer rates. The estimated mean annual calving rate from Agassiz Ice Cap in the period 1999-2002 was 0.67 +/- 0.15 km(3) a(-1), of which similar to 54% emanated from Eugenie Glacier alone. This total rate is similar to a previously estimated calving rate from Devon Ice Cap.

Efforts to restore this species to former population levels have been ineffective due in part to limited information regarding its early life history. The objectives of this study were to characterize the larval drift and biological attributes of age-0 lake sturgeon in the lower Peshtigo River, Wisconsin. Lake sturgeon larvae were captured from May to June 2002 and 2003 using drift nets, while age-0 juveniles were captured from June through October 2002 and 2003 using wading, snorkeling, backpack electrofishing, and haul-seine surveys. Larval drift occurred within 14 days of adult spawning and extended from 1 to 3 weeks in duration, with two peaks in the number of fish drifting downstream each year. Larvae had a median total length (TL) of 19 mm (range: 13-23; N = 159) in 2002 and 18 mm (range: 13-24; N = 652) in 2003. Catch-per-unit-effort for larvae was 0.18 fish h(-1) m(2) and 0.94 fish h(-1) m(2) in 2002 and 2003, respectively. Age-0 juvenile lake sturgeon exhibited rapid growth (i.e. 2.57 mm day(-1) in TL and 0.66 g day(-1) in wet weight) throughout summer and fall months; relative condition of fish in both years was approximately 100, indicating good condition. Absolute abundance of age-0 juveniles in 2003 was estimated at 261 fish using the Schnabel estimator. The results from this study indicate that the lower Peshtigo River contains important nursery habitats suitable for age-0 lake sturgeon.

Here we contribute to the taxonomy of this difficult group by describing three species new to science from very low conductivity mountain freshwater environments. Two of the new species resemble taxa established by Kutzing in the early 19th century: F. rumpens and F. vaucheriae. Fragilaria spinaspeciosa sp. nov., from a seepage (helocrenic spring) in the northern Apennines, is superficially similar to F. rumpens, but has a lower stria density. Fragilaria tridentina sp. nov. is distinguished from F. gracilis by its smaller length-to-breadth ratio and more closely spaced areolae. Fragilaria vaucheriaeraetica sp. nov. is distinguished from F. vaucheriae and F. microvaucheriae by its outline and denser striae. These last three species also have distinctly different ecologies. Fragilaria vaucheriaeraetica sp. nov. is found in very low conductivity, very low nitrate, ultra-oligotrophic waters, while F. vaucheriae and F. microvaucheriae are found in medium conductivity, high total phosphorus, and relatively high nitrate streams. Accurate species identification and knowledge of each species' ecological preferences are critically important if diatoms are to be used effectively as indicators of environmental impact and climate change. Weakly buffered, low alkalinity, low nutrient and low conductivity mountain freshwater habitats are sensitive to human disturbance and biotopes for many rare (Red List) diatoms. As such, they serve as valuable early warning systems for detecting the effects of climate change and other human activities.

Understanding Heavy Lake-Effect Snowfall: The Vertical Structure of Radar Reflectivity in a Deep Snowband over and downwind of Lake Ontario	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												The distribution of radar-estimated precipitation from lake-effect snowbands over and downwind of Lake Ontario shows more snowfall in downwind areas than over the lake itself. Here, two nonexclusive processes contributing to this are examined: the collapse of convection that lofts hydrometeors over the lake and allows them to settle downwind; and stratiform ascent over land, due to the development of a stable boundary layer, frictional convergence, and terrain, leading to widespread precipitation there. The main data sources for this study are vertical profiles of radar reflectivity and hydrometeor vertical velocity in a well-defined, deep long-lake-axis-parallel band, observed on 11 December 2013 during the Ontario Winter Lake-effect Systems (OWLeS) project. The profiles are derived from an airborne W-band Doppler radar, as well as an array of four K-band radars, an X-band profiling radar, a scanning X-band radar, and a scanning S-band radar. The presence of convection offshore is evident from deep, strong (up to 10ms(-1)) updrafts producing bounded weak-echo regions and locally heavily rimed snow particles. The decrease of the standard deviation, skewness, and peak values of Doppler vertical velocity during the downwind shore crossing is consistent with the convection collapse hypothesis. Consistent with the stratiform ascent hypothesis are (i) an increase in mean vertical velocity over land; and (ii) an increasing abundance of large snowflakes at low levels and over land, due to depositional growth and aggregation, evident from flight-level and surface particle size distribution data, and from differences in reflectivity values from S-, X-, K-, and W-band radars at nearly the same time and location.					; Geerts, Bart/H-7570-2017; Minder, Justin/K-5813-2017	Campbell, Leah/0000-0001-6601-8770; Geerts, Bart/0000-0002-1508-6121; Minder, Justin/0000-0001-7182-7898; Steenburgh, Jim/0000-0003-1028-4230; Bergmaier, Philip/0000-0002-9389-9646													0027-0644	1520-0493				NOV	2016	144	11					4221	4244		10.1175/MWR-D-16-0057.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-16-0057.1													WOS:000387312000010
J	Qiao, J; Yang, LZ; Yan, TM; Xue, F; Zhao, D				Qiao, Jun; Yang, Linzhang; Yan, Tingmei; Xue, Feng; Zhao, Dong			Nitrogen fertilizer reduction in rice production for two consecutive years in the Taihu Lake area	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Agricultural activities are the main source of non-point pollution in the Taihu Lake region, and therefore reduction of nitrogen (N) fertilizer is imperative in this area. A two-year experiment was carried out in a paddy field of summer rice-winter wheat rotation in the Taihu Lake area, and the rice growing seasons were mainly concerned in this research. Grain yield, N accumulation at rice crucial stages, N use efficiency, as well as N losses via run off during rice growing season were determined under different N application rates. No significant differences were observed in grain yield under N fertilizer application rates of 135-270 kg N ha(-1) (50-100% of the conventional N application rate). Nitrogen accumulation before the heading stage (Pre-NA) accounted for 61-95% of total nitrogen absorption in mature rice, and was positively correlated with straw dry matter at harvest. Positive correlations were found between Pre-NA and straw (0.53, p < 0.05), and between grain yield and N accumulation after the heading stage (Post-NA) (0.58, p < 0.05), suggesting that increasing nitrogen accumulation after the heading stage is crucial for grain yield improvement. Poor agronomic efficiency of applied N (AE(N)), partial factor productivity of applied N (PFPN) and internal utilization efficiency of applied N (IEN) were observed for the higher soil fertility and a higher N fertilizer input; a simple N fertilizer reduction could significantly increase the nitrogen use efficiency in this region. Nitrogen loss via runoff was positively linearly related to N application rates and severely affected by rainfall events. The highest-yielding N rates were around 232-257 kg N ha(-1), accounting for 86-95% of the conventional N application rates for the rice season. To reduce N losses and enhance N use efficiency, the recommendable N fertilization rate should be lower than that of the highest yield rate for rice season. Our findings indicated that nitrogen fertilizer reduction in the Taihu Lake area is feasible and necessary for maintaining grain yield, enhancing nitrogen use efficiency, and reducing environmental impact. However, the longer-term yield sustainability for the proper N application rate needs to be further investigated. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Of the total 1438 water samples tested, 24.2% had fluoride concentrations above the 1.5 mg/l recommended optimum concentration recommended by WHO. Regionally, by far the highest fluoride levels were recorded in the Rift Valley, where 41.2% of all samples exceeded the 1.5 mg/l level. Only 1.0% of the samples from the central and northwestern highlands and 10.0% in the southeastern highlands exceeded 1.5 mg/l. Larger proportions of deep wells (50.0%) and hot springs (90.0%) than shallow wells (27.2%) and cold springs (12.6%) exceeded the 1.5 mg/l level. The highest fluoride concentrations were recorded for Rift Valley lakes Shala (264.0 mg/l) and Abijata (202.4 mg/l) and the lowest in Lake Tana, and rivers, wells and springs in the highlands. The fluoride concentrations of the Awash River, which originates in the highlands and flows through the Rift Valley, increase downstream, giving concern over the current diversion of high-fluoride water from Lake Beseka. Of the various flourosis prevention methods tried in Ethiopia, the treatment of surface water has been shown to be the most feasible and effective for towns and large commercial farms in the Rift Valley, although defluoridation methods should be considered for smaller rural communities.

Hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata) is an invasive aquatic plant that exhibits rapid growth and may contribute to low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations (hypoxia, DO < 2.0 mg/L) during warm summer months. DO dynamics were evaluated at a range of spatial and temporal scales in three habitat types: open water, edge of hydrilla beds, and the dense interior of a hydrilla bed at two Florida lakes. Results showed that habitat type, month, and depth all significantly influenced DO, and 100% of the water column was hypoxic in late summer in the small lake. However, hydrilla biomass (kg/m(2)) was much less and no hypoxia was detected in the larger lake, suggesting that lake morphology and size may influence the abundance and impacts of hydrilla on DO. Additionally, hypoxia in edge habitat indicates that increasing ecotone may not greatly influence DO concentrations unless substantial open water area adjacent to dense beds is maintained for adequate water cycling. Our results indicated that complete water column hypoxia occurred in one of our two sample lakes and only during late summer; thus, investigations of hypoxia should consider small spatial and temporal scales.

We sampled freshwater ice and the underlying water in 19 boreal and polar lakes to evaluate whether lake ice contains an inoculum of algae, nutrients, and carbon that may contribute to lake ecosystem productivity. Boreal and Arctic lakes differed in ice duration (6 vs. >10 months), thickness (70 vs. 190 cm), and quality (predominantly snow ice vs. black ice), but in all lakes, there were consistent differences in biological and biogeochemical composition between ice and water. Particulate fractions were often more retained while most dissolved compounds were excluded from the ice; for example, the ice had more terrestrial particulate carbon, measured as fatty acid biomarkers (averages of 1.1 vs. 0.3 mu g L-1) but lower dissolved organic carbon (2.2 vs. 5.7 7.5 mu g C L-1) and inorganic phosphorus concentrations (4.0 vs. 7.5 mu g C L-1) than the underlying water. The boreal ice further had three times higher chlorophyll-a, than the water (0.9 vs. 0.3 mu g L-1). Of the dissolved fractions, the contribution of protein-like compounds was higher in the ice, and this in all lakes. These labile compounds would become available to planktonic microbes when the ice melts. Our results show that freshwater ice has an underestimated role in storage and transformation in the biogeochemical carbon cycle of ice-covered lake ecosystems. Plain Language Summary Winter ice cover of 1-2 m thickness can comprise 20%-70% of the total lake depth in boreal and Arctic lakes. While sea ice is known to contain substantial quantities of carbon and organisms that at ice melt contribute to biological production in the underlying water column, little is known about the composition of lake ice and its role in storage of organic carbon. Our analyses of 19 boreal and Arctic lakes revealed large but different stores of organic material in lake ice versus the underlying water. The ice inclusions were composed predominantly of particulate materials, but also of dissolved materials dominated by biolabile compounds that would likely stimulate metabolic pathways and aquatic food webs when they are released into the water at ice melt. This study underscores the pressing need for greater attention to winter as the dominant season at northern latitudes, and to the consequences of rapid contraction of lake ice on microbial and whole lake production.					; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019; Cusson, Mathieu/A-3026-2014; , Wauthy/AAE-7773-2019	Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; Cusson, Mathieu/0000-0002-2111-4803; Rautio, Milla/0000-0002-2375-9082; Wauthy, Maxime/0000-0002-7768-7133; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				AUG	2021	126	8							e2020JG006233	10.1029/2020JG006233	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JG006233													WOS:000688734500030

Late Quaternary paleohydrology of desert wetlands and pluvial lakes in the Soda Lake basin, central Mojave Desert, California (USA)	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Sediment cores taken near extant springs along the western margin of Soda Lake playa, as well as from the playa center, reveal dramatic hydrologic changes that occurred in the central Mojave Desert during the late Quaternary. Results of stratigraphic, chronologic, physical, chemical, and microfossil analyses of seven cores, ranging in length from 5 to 23 m, help refine the timing and character of the final stages of pluvial Lake Mojave during the late Pleistocene and define distinct periods of wetland development in the early and late Holocene. Evidence shows that an incipient lake occupied the central Soda Lake basin by at least 25.0 ka (ka = thousands of calibrated C-14 years before present), and a fully developed Lake Mojave was present between 20.5 and 12.8 ka, before receding and ultimately yielding to playa conditions by 11.0 ka. Organic-rich "black mats" appear in several cores along the playa margin between 10.7 and 9.0 ka, suggesting that spring-fed wetlands persisted in this area long after the lake had regressed. The basin remained relatively dry throughout most of the Holocene until wetland ecosystems expanded along the margins between 0.73 and 0.18 ka, coincident with part of the Medieval Climate Anomaly and Little Ice Age. Overall, our results demonstrate that buried sediments surrounding extant and extinct springs can be used to reconstruct past hydrologic conditions in desert environments on a variety of spatial and temporal scales, and provide important baseline information for effective management of limited desert resources.

First observations of the freshwater jellyfish &ITCraspedacusta sowerbii &ITLankester, 1880 in Ireland coincides with unusually high water temperatures	BIOINVASIONS RECORDS												The freshwater hydrozoan Craspedacusta sowerbii was observed for the first time in Ireland at five localities in two separate river catchments (Shannon and Eme) during the summer of 2013. All collected medusae from Lough Derg on the Shannon catchment were female. Analysis of water temperature data for the period 2001-2015 found that water temperatures greater than 21 degrees C were only recorded in 2013. The occurrence of medusae in three distinct areas during this unusually warm summer suggests that it may have been present in its polyp form for some years, or even decades. While it is not known when the species arrived in Ireland, the spread of this species may have involved different pathways. With climate warming, further appearances of the medusa-stage may be expected.					; Haberlin, Damien/ABA-9169-2021	Doyle, Thomas/0000-0003-1616-5590; 													2242-1300					JUN	2016	5	2					67	74		10.3391/bir.2016.5.2.02	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/bir.2016.5.2.02													WOS:000419952100002

Based on its hydrostratigraphic characteristics, the aquifer in this area can be divided into an unconsolidated floodplain deposit aquifer (Qfd) and a volcanic aquifer (Vc). Study focus: This research investigated the hydrogeological characteristics and hydrogeochemical parameters of 42 groundwater samples obtained in the summer and rainy seasons. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were used to identify the natural and anthropogenic impacts that likely influenced groundwater quality. New hydrological insights for the region: The groundwater type in Qfd and Vc is mainly Ca-Na-HCO3, suggesting that the hydrochemical groundwater of both aquifers is affected by the same sources. This study found evidence of ion exchange between Ca2+ and Na+ in both seasons. The five principal components had a cumulative variance greater than 76.11 and 77.88 % in the rainy and summer seasons, respectively. Based on correlation analysis and PCA, the sources of the groundwater chemistry are generally silicate and calcite weathering from geological formations, including alkali feldspar and Ca2+- and Mg2+- rich minerals. Moreover, some ions arose from anthropogenic activities, typically irrigation water and sewage wastewater. The presence of photphate (PO43-) may be related to the dissolution of apatite and associated with anthropogenic activities, causing an increase in PO43- in the rainy season.

We developed a new homogenised time series of daily day time Lake Surface Water Temperature (LSWT) over the last thirty years (1986-2015) at a spatial resolution of 1 km from thirteen polar orbiting satellites. The new homogenisation procedure implemented in this study corrects for the different acquisition times of the satellites standardizing the derived LSWT to 12:00 UTC. In this study, we developed new time series of LSWT for five large lakes in Italy and evaluated the product with in-situ data from the respective lakes. Furthermore, we estimated the long-term annual and summer trends, the temporal coherence of mean LSWT between the lakes, and studied the intra-annual variations and long-term trends from the newly developed LSWT time series. We found a regional warming trend at a rate of 0.017 degrees C yr(-1) annually and 0.032 degrees C yr(-1) during summer. Mean annual and summer LSWT temporal in these lakes were found to be highly coherent. Amidst the reported rapid warming of lakes globally, it is important to understand the long-term variations of surface temperature at a regional scale. This study contributes a new method to derive long-term accurate LSWT for lakes with sparse in-situ data thereby facilitating understanding of regional level changes in lake's surface temperature.

Developing a tile drainage module for the Cold Regions Hydrological Model: lessons from a farm in southern Ontario, Canada	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Systematic tile drainage is used extensively in poorly drained agricultural lands to remove excess water and improve crop growth; however, tiles can also transfer nutrients from farmlands to downstream surface water bodies, leading to water quality problems. Thus, there is a need to simulate the hydrological behaviour of tile drains to understand the impacts of climate or land management change on agricultural surface and subsurface runoff. The Cold Regions Hydrological Model (CRHM) is a physically based, modular modelling system developed for cold regions. Here, a tile drainage module is developed for CRHM. A multi-variable, multi-criteria model performance evaluation strategy was deployed to examine the ability of the module to capture tile discharge under both winter and summer conditions (NSE > 0.29, RSR < 0.84 and PBias < 20 for tile flow and saturated storage simulations). Initial model simulations run at a 15 min interval did not satisfactorily represent tile discharge; however, model simulations improved when the time step was lengthened to hourly but also with the explicit representation of capillary rise for moisture interactions between the rooting zone and groundwater, demonstrating the significance of capillary rise above the saturated storage layer in the hydrology of tile drains in loam soils. Novel aspects of this module include the sub-daily time step, which is shorter than most existing models, and the use of field capacity and its corresponding pressure head to provide estimates of drainable water and the thickness of the capillary fringe, rather than using detailed soil retention curves that may not always be available. An additional novel aspect is the demonstration that flows in some tile drain systems can be better represented and simulated when related to shallow saturated storage dynamics.					; Costa, Diogo/AAJ-6158-2021; Macrae, Merrin/KPB-7902-2024; Pomeroy, John/IZE-0873-2023; Pomeroy, John W./A-8589-2013	Kompanizare, Mazda/0000-0002-0165-2401; Costa, Diogo/0000-0002-8841-2522; Pomeroy, John W./0000-0002-4782-7457													1027-5606	1607-7938				JUL 2	2024	28	13					2785	2807		10.5194/hess-28-2785-2024	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2785-2024													WOS:001260774400001

Water quality of Hanna Lake; Balochistan province in Pakistan has been investigated during 2014. A total of 22 samples were collected during summer and winter months. The physicochemical parameters, metals and bacteriological analysis were performed and compared with WHO, guidelines 2011 and NSDWQ (National Standard of Drinking Water Quality, Pakistan). pH, chloride, hardness, nitrate, total dissolved solids (TDS), Na, K, and Zn are well within the permissible limit as per World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and NSDWQ. The concentration of sulphate, Ni and Pb were relatively higher with respect to WHO guidelines and NSDWQ. As concentration was within the limit as per NSDWQ while it is relatively higher (0.04 mg/l) as per WHO guidelines of (0.01 mg/l). All bacteriological parameters (total coliform, total fecal coliforms and total faecal streptococci) were extremely high from public health stand point that renders the water unfit for human consumption. The continued deteriorating environmental conditions of Hanna lake reflect ignorance from government side that can be mended by consistent supervision, long term management and strict enforcement of environmental laws pertaining to the protection of environmental resources. The present study recommends that priority should be given to monitor the water quality of Hanna lake on long term basis which would be helpful in future planning and management of this important water resource in already water scarce area.

Although they are found in large numbers worldwide and their numbers are increasing every year due to the creation of new ponds, we do not have sufficient data on direct estimates of emission fluxes from these waterbodies yet. Herein, we present results from a set of 24 ponds located in the Morava River floodplain, Czech Republic. The ponds varied in their origin (man-made vs. natural), size, depth, sediment organic matter content, and macrophyte growth. Water chemistry parameters, concentrations, and exchange of CO2 and CH4 with the atmosphere were directly measured during the day and night from spring to summer 2020. The ponds emitted more CO2 and CH4 during nighttime, and both CO2 and, in particular, CH4 emissions tend to increase with the duration of pond inundation. Total diffusive fluxes of CO2 and CH4 into the atmosphere ranged from -37072.9 to 432683.3 mu mol m(-2) d(-1), and -11485.3 to 95,889.6 mu mol m(-2) day(-1), respectively. Generally, all ponds were found to be a net source of CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere. In average, ponds emitted 7.64 g CO2-equivalent m(-2) d(-1). Thus, our results indicate that floodplain ponds are an important source of both CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere and they should not be omitted in a regional carbon budget.																				2296-665X				JUL 12	2023	11								1006988	10.3389/fenvs.2023.1006988	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2023.1006988													WOS:001036921600001

Evaluation of real-time satellite rainfall products in semi-arid/arid Australia	20TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION (MODSIM2013)					20th International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM)	DEC 01-06, 2013	Adelaide, AUSTRALIA	CSIRO, Univ S Australia, Ctr Ind & Appl Math, Australian Govt, Bur Meteorol, GOYDER Inst, Govt S Australia, Australian Math Soc, Australian Math Sci Inst, Simulat Australia, Australian & New Zealand Ind & Appl Math				The quality of runoff/streamflow modelling is critically dependent on the quality of rainfall forcing data and a quantitative understanding of its uncertainty. More accurate rainfall data with clearly defined uncertainty has implications for water resource management and flood prediction. This is important for the Lake Eyre Basin (LEB) in central Australia where the landscape is very flat and hydrophobic soils are common. The LEB is also of interest in terms of climate given that it is predominantly semi-arid/arid with a large north-south rainfall gradient. The north is subject to intense tropical (summer-time) based rainfall events, with weaker predominantly winter rainfall occurring in the south where annual totals are approximately 3-4 times lower on average than in the north. The remoteness of this region means that the in-situ rainfall observation network is sparse compared to more densely populated regions across Australia's eastern seaboard, hence the potential of remotely sensed spatial rainfall data to provide useful information here needs to be examined. Three real-time satellite precipitation products, the TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis 3B42RT (TRMM-RT) Version 7, CPC Morphed precipitation (CMORPH) Version 1, and Precipitation Estimation from Remote Sensing Information using Artificial Neural Network (PERSIANN), are assessed against in-situ rain gauge data over a nine-year study period to examine characteristics of their error in LEB. An up-scaled version of the Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP) spatial rainfall product (interpolated from gauge data) was also assessed against the same gauge data used for the satellite products, as a benchmark for comparing the satellite product assessments. All data were mapped to a 0.25 degrees resolution grid and aggregated to daily time step rainfall totals (9am to 9am), with errors calculated as differences in daily rainfall between the products and gauge data for the nine-years. Products were assessed by inter-comparing the distribution of their daily errors via boxplots, and through bias (average error) and root mean square differences (RMSD) over the nine-years. The ability of satellite products to detect rain gauge measured events was also examined via calculation of the Probability of Detection (POD) and False Alarm Ratio (FAR) metrics. Based on error distributions for each rainfall product over the full nine-years, TRMM-RT is the closest match to gauge observations of the three satellite products. Its mean bias is similar to 0.3 mm/day, approximately 3.5 and 4.5 times less than that of CMORPH and PERSIANN respectively, while the unbiased Root Mean Square Difference (RMSD) of similar to 4.3 mm/day for TRMM-RT is less than half that for both CMORPH and PERSIANN. Comparisons of product error distributions show consistently lower variation and less extreme outlier values occurring for TRMM-RT error. In addition, while the median TRMM-RT error displays a trend of increasing negative bias with increasing rainfall totals, the median CMORPH and PERSIANN errors show the opposite and steeper trend. Common amongst all of the products is an increase in absolute error ranges with increasing daily rainfall totals, in addition to absolute errors calculated over wet season months (mostly summer) having a generally larger spread than over dry season months (mostly winter) in the basin's tropical north. The results provide insights into how error for a product such as TRMM-RT may be best modelled. There are a number of extreme errors in all products, shown as outliers in boxplots, and mostly implying large over-estimates of rainfall. By defining extreme outlier error values as >20 mm/day and/or >100% of gauge values, a sample of these were found to occur at or near the edge of major rainfall systems as delineated by the TRMM-RT products, indicating they may be an artifact of spatial inaccuracy in resolving the edges of rainfall extents, warranting further study. POD and FAR metrics for TRMM-RT further demonstrated differences in performance across ranges of daily rainfall totals, and between tropical wet and dry seasons in the LEB. POD results show there is generally greater chance of detecting the presence of larger rainfall accumulations. From FAR statistics, false alarms are generally more prevalent amongst smaller TRMM-RT estimates and in dry seasons, where FAR values decrease in relation to increasing average TRMM-RT estimates.

J	Karetnikov, S; Leppäranta, M; Montonen, A				Karetnikov, Sergey; Lepparanta, Matti; Montonen, Anni			A time series of over 100 years of ice seasons on Lake Ladoga	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake Ladoga ice conditions were examined for the period 1913-2015 based on weather data and Finnish ice data (1913-1937) and Soviet/Russian airborne and satellite surveys (1943-2015). The data from the time series included the evolution of the ice concentration each winter, and occasionally of ice thickness. The mean freezing and breakup dates were November 26 and May 15, respectively, and the annual frequency of complete freeze over of the lake was 0.83. The ice may break up any time during winter and undergo rapid shifts. Therefore, the evolution of the concentration is an additional climatological property of ice cover, compressed into one index equal to the time integral of the ice concentration over the ice season. The period from 1990 to present was much milder than the preceding years. First-order analytic models fitted the data well. The evolution of ice conditions was synchronized with air temperature measurements from the Sortavala weather station on the northern coast of the lake. The increase in ice concentration depended on the accumulated freezing-degree-days (AFDD) and the hypsographic curve, while the ice thickness increased with the square root of AFDD. Vertical and lateral ice decreases during the breakup period were dictated by solar radiation and accumulated positive degree-days (APDD). These models provided an insight into the climatological properties of the time series. (C) 2017 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Seasonality of change: Summer warming rates do not fully represent effects of climate change on lake temperatures	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Responses in lake temperatures to climate warming have primarily been characterized using seasonal metrics of surface-water temperatures such as summertime or stratified period average temperatures. However, climate warming may not affect water temperatures equally across seasons or depths. We analyzed a long-term dataset (1981-2015) of biweekly water temperature data in six temperate lakes in Wisconsin, U.S.A. to understand (1) variability in monthly rates of surface- and deep-water warming, (2) how those rates compared to summertime average trends, and (3) if monthly heterogeneity in water temperature trends can be predicted by heterogeneity in air temperature trends. Monthly surface- water temperature warming rates varied across the open-water season, ranging from 0.013 in August to 0.0738 degrees C yr(-1) in September (standard deviation [SD]: 0.0258 degrees C yr(-1)). Deep-water trends during summer varied less among months (SD: 0.0068 degrees C yr(-1)), but varied broadly among lakes (-0.0568 degrees C yr(-1) to 0.0358 degrees C yr(-1), SD: 0.0348 degrees C yr(-1)). Trends in monthly surface- water temperatures were well correlated with air temperature trends, suggesting monthly air temperature trends, for which data exist at broad scales, may be a proxy for seasonal patterns in surface- water temperature trends during the open water season in lakes similar to those studied here. Seasonally variable warming has broad implications for how ecological processes respond to climate change, because phenological events such as fish spawning and phytoplankton succession respond to specific, seasonal temperature cues.

Sediments were collected in summer and in winter in two points of the lake: along the 15 m bathymetric line characterized by high algae production and in the centre of the lake (60 m depth). Concentration values, C-13-NMR and FTIR spectra, and data of elemental analyses of fulvic acids underline the continuous process of humic compound formation from algae debris and the shift of humified material from the production zone (rich of caracee) to the centre of the lake. The molecular weight distribution (molecule number obtained considering the molecular weight average of each fraction) show that humic acids are a heterogeneous system characterised both by high and by low molecular weight molecules. Conversely, FA represent a homogeneous system (compounds having molecular weight included between 3000 and 500 Dalton at least 80%). We found that there is no relationship between the complexing capacity values and the carboxyl group concentration and/or the molecular weight distribution; on the contrary, there was observed to be a correlation between the complexing capacity and the structural configuration. The presence of material in a very early stage of diagenesis negatively affects the complexing capacity of FA. This relationship is not evident in the case of HA, which form a heterogeneous system in which also high molecular weight molecules are present.

Trin. ex Steud. were studied monthly in 1994 to estimate the carbon/nitrogen balance at eight sites and lakes. These stands had large differences in standing crop, with less than 400 g shoot dry weight m(-2) in a mesotrophic lake and up to 1500 g dry weight m(-2) in hypertrophic lakes. No significant differences were found between sites in the nitrate and ammonium concentration of the interstitial water because of very high variability in space and time. The relative nitrogen content (% of dry weight) of different leaves and culm internodes showed significant differences but only between the most different sites. The amount and composition of free amino acids and sugars of the basal culm internodes showed a clear association with the maximum standing crop of the sites. During the later shoot growth phase (July to September), plants of the high productivity sites exhibited a high content of dissolved amino acids in the basal culm internodes with asparagine as the main transport and storage compound, but a very low sugar content with sucrose as the main transport component in summer. At low productivity sites of mesotrophic to moderate eutrophic lakes, this relationship was inverse. The mean of the proportions of total sugars to total amino acids and asparagine to sucrose, respectively, were significantly correlated with the maximum standing crop of the eight sites. Alanine and serine were present in high concentration in early spring before outgrowth of the tiller without pressure induced ventilation of the subtending vertical rhizome parts. The results are discussed with respect to the indicatory value of the amino acid and sugar content of the basal shoot internodes to the productivity of the different stands and their limitation by the nitrogen availability of the plants.

In this study, we use cloud-free Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, preferable to the optical imagery. We have used 5 convolutional neural networks (CNNs), including HRNet, DenseNet, SegNet, ResNet and DeepLab v3 + for flood monitoring in the Poyang Lake area, and compared their performances with the traditional methods - the bimodal threshold segmentation (BTS) and the OSTU method. The HRNet has superior performance in water body identification with the highest precision and efficiency, based on a parallel structure to not only extract rich semantic information but also maintain high-resolution features in the whole process. Besides, speckle noise reduction by deep convolutional neural networks in SAR imagery is better compared with the Refined Lee filter. The CNNs are then used to monitor the temporal evolution of summer flooding (May-Nov.) in 2020. Results show the smallest water coverage of Poyang Lake in late May; it gradually increases to the maximum in mid-July, and then shows a downward trend until November.

The dataset also includes environmental magnetic and organic geochemistry data on catchment soils of the Bednikund lake. The presented data is related to the research article "Middle Holocene Indian summer monsoon variability and its impact on cultural changes in the Indian subcontinent" [1] . The chronology of the Bednikund lake trench (BBK) profile is well established with seven AMS C-14 dates. The multiproxy data is provided in tabular format in an excel file along with ages in Mendeley Data Repository. The multiproxy data can be significantly utilized for regional correlation of Indian summer monsoon (ISM) variability during the middle Holocene as well as for correlation of global climatic events. The data can also be reutilized in paleoclimate modelling for precipitation change over the past similar to 6000 years. (C) 2021 The Authors.

The maximum assimilation number from six P-I experiments during thermal stratification averaged 2.1 mg C .cntdot. mg Chl-1 .cntdot. h-1 which agreed well with estimates from the 1970s. Chlorophyll-corrected P-I curves were combined with incident irradiation, chlorophyll concentrations, and extinction coefficients to estimate daily production (model estimate). Summer average integral production estimates in 1983 and 1984 were 615-630 mg C .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. d-1. Approximately 50% of summer primary production occurred below the epilimnion. Daily model production estimates were higher than 24-h in situ estimates at light intensities above lk, the light saturation parameter, and similar at intensities below lk. Comparisons of production estimates coverted to growth rates suggest that 24-h in situ estimates provide a measure close to net production whereas model estimates provide a measure greater than net production. Summer epilimnetic growth rate estimates were low (range 0.06-0.60 .cntdot. d-1), reflecting the limited availability of phosphorus.

In the water column of Lake Greifen, Cu is strongly completed by organic ligands, whereas a large fraction of Zn is present in weak complexes and free aquo ions. The sedimentation rate of Zn exhibits a maximum during summer and this behavior indicates removal from the water column together with biological material; depletion of Zn from the epilimnion results from this removal process. The removal of Cu by sedimentation is less efficient during summer Zn and Cu also sediment together with manganese oxides, which are precipitated during lake overturn. The role of algae in this system with regard to the binding of Cu and Zn in the particulate phase and to the production of ligands in solution is discussed.

The upper 3 in of sediment consist of lacustrine clays containing it Late Pleistocene sequence of extinct and extant fauna, and in the upper 1.7m, an associated archaeological record. Changes observed in the pollen sequence include: (i) a peak in charcoal values corresponding to a dramatic decline in Casuarina woodland to chenopod shrubland at 2.5 in, respresenting a climatic shift to more arid conditions (ii) chenopod shrubland moved into decline with the spread of grasslands around 1.7 111, and the amelioration in climatic conditions persisted until approximately 28,000 BP. A regime emerged which resulted in extended lake dry periods and peak aridity by approximately 19,000 BP and (iii) at I m depth, around 19,000 BP a shift to peak arid conditions is observed with a return of Chenopodiaceae and a decline in grasses. The lake entered an ephemeral phase that has persisted until the present day. The broad palaeoenvironmental framework of lake history, climate and vegetation change spans the archaeological and faunal records from Cuddie Springs. The direct association enables a closer examination of causation in faunal extinctions and human subsistence activities in the Australian and zone. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Stable isotopes reveal an imprint of harmful algal blooms on Lake Erie	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												In Lake Erie, harmful algal blooms have become a recurrent problem during the summer-through-fall growing season. We investigated if the annual disturbance of harmful algal blooms in Lake Erie relates to distinct differences in carbon and nitrogen stable isotope composition (813C and 815N values). Guided by near real-time satellite imagery, we tracked the blooms in western and central Lake Erie during July and August 2019 for the collection of in-bloom and out-of-bloom suspended particulate organic matter. The 815NPOM values did not differ between in-bloom and out-of-bloom samples; however, 813CPOM values were significantly higher in the in-bloom compared to out-of-bloom samples. We used principal component analysis to investigate how water quality relates to biogeochemical indicators in in-bloom and out-of-bloom samples. In-bloom samples were only found in the western basin. They contained lower concentrations of ions (Na+, Cl-, SO42-) and inorganic nitrogen (NO2-, NO3-, NH4+), and higher concentrations of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and organic particles (TSS, VSS, DOC). After uncovering patterns in in-bloom and out-of-bloom samples in the western portion of Lake Erie, we created isoscapes to compare particulate organic matter samples collected throughout the lake during July-September. The 815NPOM values varied spatially across the three basins, and in the central and eastern basins, 815NPOM values were higher in September relative to July. We found 813CPOM values displayed a longitudinal spatial gradient with higher values in the western basin and lower values towards the eastern basin with no temporal separation based on sampling month. 815NPOM and 813CPOM values provide a baseline for future isotope studies in Lake Erie, and observed variation in delta 13CPOM reveals a harmful algal bloom-produced change in the carbon biogeochemistry of Lake Erie.

The simulated 10-m above ground level (AGL) mean wind fields are compared with observations at 64 stations comprehensively, by using the analog deviation. This score shows that the simulated wind pattern agrees well with the observed. More local characteristics can be found in the high-resolution simulated wind atlas. The wind speed is higher along the eastern coast and around inland lakes, while lower in urban and mountainous areas. Wind energy calculations have shown that the vicinities of big water bodies, such as Luoma Lake, Hongze Lake, Gaoyou Lake, the mouth of the Yangtze River and Tai Lake, are regions with rich wind energy resources. The average wind power densities in these areas are above 140W/m(2). The wind resources decrease steadily when moving away from the coast, and the wind power densities are between 80 and 90 W/m(2). Mountainous and urban areas are short of wind energy resources. The average wind power densities in Zhangba Mountains and cities of Xuzhou, Huai'an and Nanjing are less than 60 W/m(2). Moreover, it is indicated that there are significant seasonal variations in wind energy resources in Jiangsu Province. The wind power densities are larger in winter than in summer. The values in rich regions increase to 200 W/m(2) at 30-m-AGL and 320 W/m(2) at 60-m-AGL.					; Yuan, wang/MGA-0148-2025	Lu, Yixiong/0000-0001-9823-9367; 													2157-4839		978-1-4244-2486-3				2009							737	742																WOS:000270497300176

Emergence patterns were similar among years with the most intense emergence (> 70%) occurring during the declining stream discharge following the spring flood. This period coincided with stream pH depressions (minimum pH 5.2) in 2 of 3 years, suggesting emergence behaviour frequently subjects the earliest free-swimming life interval of brook charr to episodic acidification events.					; Curry, R./ABG-3515-2020; Gunn, John/F-8057-2012	Gunn, John/0000-0002-4052-2781; Curry, R.

To that end, we combined in situ measurements with profile data. CO2 production averaged 20 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in a 3 m deep lake and similar to 45 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in four larger lakes, similar to experimental observations at temperatures below 4 degrees C. CO2 production was predicted by the initial rate of loss of oxygen near the sediments at ice-on and by the full water column loss of oxygen throughout the winter. The time series data also showed the lake-size and time dependent contribution of sediment respiration to under-ice circulation and the decreased near-bottom flows enabling anoxia and CH4 accumulation.

J	EFFLER, SW; FIELD, SD; WILCOX, DA				EFFLER, SW; FIELD, SD; WILCOX, DA			THE CARBONATE CHEMISTRY OF GREEN LAKE, JAMESVILLE, NEW-YORK	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												The temporal and vertical distributions of inorganic C and related forms were assessed for the mixolimmion of Green Lake, Jamesville, New York, based on a biweekly monitoring program conducted for a 14 mo. period. The daily time structure of the distributions was delineated for a single diurnal cycle. Attendant [H2CO3] ([H2CO3] + [CO2(aq)]) and calcite equilibrium conditions were determined through solution of equilibrium equations, adjusted for temperature and ionic-strength. Inorganic C equilibrium conditions within the ion-rich chemocline/monimolimnion were evaluated with the aid of a computer model, which incorporated ion-pair interactions, utilizing data obtained from a single sampling. A seasonal cycle was demonstrated for the inorganic C species within the lake''s mixolimnion which was temporally consistent with the system''s thermal and productivity transformations. Dramatic differences in carbonate chemistry developed between the epilimnion and hypolimnion during summer stratification. The epilimnion was highly supersaturated with respect to calcite throughout summer stratification. Minimum H2CO3 saturation was observed for the same period. These seasonal variations in equilibrium conditions, as well as diurnal variations, were mediated largely through temporal changes in pH. Factoral analysis of the temporal trends with respect to the influencing factors of temperature, ionic strength, and CO2 metabolism, indicates they were largely a result of photosynthetic consumption of CO2. Precipitation of calcite within the upper 5 m during summer was implied by the continuing decrease in [Ca+2] during the calcite supersaturation period. Of the calcite formed, 75% is estimated to reach either the mixolimnic sediments or the monimolimnion. Most of the calcite entering the monimolimnion would probably reach the sediments, since the layer is nearly saturated or supersaturated with the mineral.																			0270-5060	2156-6941					1981	1	2					141	153		10.1080/02705060.1981.9664026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1981.9664026													WOS:A1981MQ05000002

To elucidate these dynamics, a pragmatic, multi-source monitoring framework integrates archived Sentinel-2 and Landsat imagery with treatment-plant records (2017-mid-2025). Unitless spectral indices (e.g., AreaBGR) for whiting detection and chlorophyll-a proxies are combined with laboratory measurements of turbidity, pH, total organic carbon, manganese, and hydrological metrics, analyzed via spatiotemporal Hovmoller diagrams, Pearson correlations, and interrupted time-series models. Two seasonal whiting regimes are identified: a biogenic summer mode (southern origin; elevated chlorophyll-a; water temperature > 15 degrees C; pH > 8.5) and a non-biogenic winter mode (northern inflows). Following the wildfire, the system exhibits characteristics that could be related to possible hypolimnetic anoxia, prolonged whiting, a similar to 50% rise in organic carbon, and a manganese excursion to similar to 0.4 mg L-1 at the deeper intake. Crucially, the post-fire period shows a decoupling of AreaBGR from turbidity (r approximate to 0.233 versus approximate to 0.859 pre-fire)-a key diagnostic finding that confirms a fundamental shift in the composition and optical properties of suspended particulates. The manganese spike is best explained by the confluence of a wildfire-induced biogeochemical predisposition (anoxia and Mn mobilization) and a consequential operational decision (relocation to a deeper, Mn-rich intake). This framework establishes diagnostic baselines and thresholds for managing fire-impacted reservoirs, supports the use of remote sensing in data-scarce systems, and informs adaptive operations under increasing climate pressures.																				2073-4441				SEP 17	2025	17	18							2755	10.3390/w17182755	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17182755													WOS:001581102800001

Unexpected great difference was detected for arsenic levels between the collected water samples of three successive surveys in Taihu in May 2009, Fall 2009, and May 2010, with arsenic levels in May 2009 being more than tenfold of those in Fall 2009 and May 2010. Such difference in arsenic levels do not routinely happen like seasonal changes as reported in many other lakes of the world. Considering arsenic contents as well as some basic aquatic monitoring data of the lake, such great arsenic fluctuations were probably due to the effects of strong hydraulic turbulence in Taihu for its very shallow depth. The spatial distribution of arsenic in Taihu were similar, despite great difference of arsenic levels in the three successive surveys, indicating such differences did not come from arsenic external input around the lake. The sudden increase of arsenic levels in Taihu highlights the importance of stabilization or removing of arsenic in lake sediments so as to keep arsenic lower than the national hygiene standard of China.

Taihu Lake, the third largest freshwater lake in China, is one of the most eutrophic lakes. Increased phosphorus concentration is thought to be the primary cause of water eutrophication. Proper total phosphorus (TP) monitoring is essential to effectively manage eutrophication in the Taihu Lake. In this study, 216 sample points with 172 modelling points and 44 verification points acquired from 5 field experiments in Taihu Lake, a semi-analytical model was established for estimating the TP concentration based on the absorption coefficient, with the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE) as 16.8% and 0.04 mg L-1, respectively. The application of the model on Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) data proved the suitability of the model for satellite image with the MAPE and RMSE as 28.56% and 0.05 mg L-1. The OLCI derived TP concentration in the Taihu Lake shown the unique temporal and spatial distribution: TP concentration in Zhushan Bay, Meiliang Bay, Gonghu Bay, and the western coastal regions was significantly higher than the eastern, the southern, and the centre areas. The concentration of TP in Taihu Lake was the highest in summer and the lowest in winter. Furthermore, the versatility of this method was validated by applying in the Hongze Lake and Qiandao Lake, which is a water body dominated by inorganic suspended matter and a clean water body in China with the MAPE and RMSE as 24.10%, 19.35% and 0.004 mg L-1, 0.014 mg L-1.

Wavelet analysis of δ18O and δ13C time-series from an Holocene speleothem record from Corchia Cave (central Italy): insights for the recurrence of dry-wet periods in the Central Mediterranean	ITALIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												In this work, the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is used to analyse stable isotope (delta O-18 and delta C-13) time-series from a speleothem from Corchia Cave (Apuan Alps, Tuscany, central Italy). The record spans the ca. 13.3-0.4 ka period. Both proxies are thought to represent changes in the amount of precipitation and in the hydrological recharge over the cave catchment, and to indicate alternating wetter and drier periods. The CWT shows the presence of different dominant frequency components, changing across the Middle-Holocene. This can be interpreted as mostly related to long term variations in summer and winter insolation, resulting from changes in orbital parameters. The lower frequencies (millennial scale) individuated may have different origin, not always obvious, and are rarely reported in others records. Instead, the short period components (multidecadal to centennial scale) could be in the range of frequencies considered as expression of the solar variability. delta O-18 and delta C-13 time-series show very coherent response to lower frequencies, but delta O-18 time-series show the presence of higher frequencies, that are not reported in the delta C-13 record. This can be related to a different response of the soil-karst system compared to variability in the delta O-18 of precipitation and their recharge of the karst. A Matlab (R) code has been implemented to compute the wavelet transform and to generate all the results presented in this work.

It is of great significance to define the formation mechanism of fine-grained sedimentary rocks for favorable reservoir prediction and exploration target selection in Jimusar Sag. Based on detailed petrographic characterization, in-situ geochemical parameter testing, and high-resolution cycle analysis, sedimentary cycles on the micron to meter scales were successfully identified in Lucaogou Formation from Jimusar Sag. Precession-forced paleo-environmental evolution mainly induces the deposition of meter-scale sedimentary cycles. In the period of low precession, the paleo-environment is cold and dry, the lake level falls. Silt-grained particles advance toward the center of the lake basin carried by gravity current, thus siliciclastic sediments are mainly deposited. In the period of high precession, the climate is warm and humid, the lake level rises. The inputs of siliciclastic sediments are limited and the temperature increases, which are conductive to the carbonate deposition. On this basis, high-frequency paleo-environmental evolution caused by solar activity (70-110yr cycle) further induces the formation of sedimentary cycles on micron-centimeter scale. When the precession is low, the rise and fall of lake level controlled by solar activity is contribute to the deposition of tuffrich lamina and silt-grained felsic lamina, respectively. The period of high precession is under the background of overall high lake-level, the rise and fall of lake level, along with fall and rise of temperature, controlled by solar activity finally induce the deposition of tuff-rich lamina and carbonate lamina, respectively. The development of multi-scale sedimentary cycles controlled by Milankovitch cycle and solar activity cycle have important implications for shale oil enrichment. The fine-grained sediments deposited during the period of low precession and intense solar activity dominate feldspar dissolution pores and intergranular pores, which are favorable for shale oil enrichment.

J	Yao, X; Iqbal, J; Li, LJ; Zhou, ZK				Yao, Xin; Iqbal, Javed; Li, Ling-jing; Zhou, Zheng-kai			Characteristics of mountain glacier surge hazard: learning from a surge event in NE Pamir, China	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE												Abnormal glacier movement is likely to result in canyon-type hazards chain, such as the barrier lake of Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon formed by glacier debris flow in October 2018 in China. Glacier hazard usually evolves from the glacier surge and may occur in a regular cycle. Understanding the characteristics and process of glacier surge is important for early hazard recognition and hazard assessment. Based on field investigations, remote sensing interpretations and SAR offset-tracking surveys, this study confirms a typical glacier surge in the northeast Pamir, and presents its characteristics and processes. Black ice mixed moraines choking uplift and overflowing lateral marine are the most important scenic characteristics, which were formed under the conditions of stagnant glacier downstream and abundant super-glacial moraine. Glacier movement event can be divided into a five-period cycle including quiescent, inoculation, initiation, fracture and decline. This surge event lasted for about 300 days, initiated in February 2015 developed extensive fracturing zone in spring and early summer at maximum velocity of 10 +/- 0.95 m/day, declined after August 2015 and recovered to quiescent status in October 2015 for the next inoculation. The average height of glacier receiving area increased by 20-40 m with 2.7-3.6x10(8) m(3) ice transferred from glacier reservoir, and this volume accumulation again require 50-100 years for glacier mass balance which gives approximately 100 years frequency of the glacier surge. Nevertheless, long-period increase of precipitation and temperature were favorable for the occurrence, hydrological instability is the direct triggering mechanism, and while the Glacier Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) hazards are unlikely to occur with this surge.					; Iqbal, Javed/KLE-0407-2024; li, lingjing/MAH-5841-2025	Li, Lingjing/0000-0001-6735-5592; Iqbal, Javed/0000-0001-8675-1304; Zhenkai, Zhou/0000-0003-2376-660X; YAO, Xin/0000-0003-3063-2546; 													1672-6316	1993-0321				JUL	2019	16	7					1515	1533		10.1007/s11629-018-5282-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-018-5282-x													WOS:000474574600003

This paper presents an investigation that addressed the climate change effects on transport and the fate of bacteria in Milwaukee's urban coastal area. This investigation was part of a study on climate change risks and impacts that included downscaling of climate change data for meteorological stations around Lake Michigan, and implementation of a hydrologic model that predicts tributary flows and bacteria loads. A method to select scenarios appropriate to link watershed and lake transport processes is presented. For the watershed, the sensitivity of bacterial loads with respect to changes in spring-season precipitation and air temperature is critical, while for lake transport, the most important driver is the wind field. Watershed and lake processes are linked by using spring-season watershed loading in the simulation of coastal transport. Scenarios for hydrodynamic modeling were developed by selecting climate projections that yielded high-and-low percentile projected spring-season wind speed. The patterns of bacteria transport showed significant changes under climate change conditions, and the changes in fecal coliform concentration at critical locations were explained by changes in current vector fields.

J	MATHIAS, JA; BARICA, J				MATHIAS, JA; BARICA, J			FACTORS CONTROLLING OXYGEN DEPLETION IN ICE-COVERED LAKES	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Winter O2 depletion rates from 4 sets of Canadian lakes (prairie, southeastern Ontario, Arctic and Experimental Lakes Area) differing in morphometry and trophic state were analyzed. An inverse relationship was found between O2 depletion rate and mean depth. The effect of lake trophic status on O2 depletion rate was demonstrable after the influence of basin morphometry was removed by regression of O2 depletion rate against the sediment area: lake volume ratio. The sediments of eutrophic lakes consumed O2 about 3 times faster (0.23 g.cntdot.m-2.cntdot.d[day]-) than those of oligotrophic lakes (0.08 g.cntdot.m-2.cntdot.d-1), but water column respiration was about the same (0.01 g.cntdot.m-3.cntdot.d-1) for both groups of lakes. Data from prairie lakes showed that the winter O2 consumption was limited by O2 supply below an average whole-lake O2 concentration of 3.8 mg.cntdot.l-1. The rate of eddy diffusion near the sediments in ice-covered prairie lakes was 3.72 .+-. 1.41 .times. 10-3 cm2.cntdot.s-1. Implications for lake management during the winter are discussed.

Remotely sensed time series of rapid terrace formation: Laguna del Viedma valley (Patagonia)	ANDEAN GEOLOGY												The Patagonian Andes were affected by a range of geophysical drivers of landscape incision during the Last Glacial Interglacial Transition and Early Holocene. Deciphering drivers of river system response during this period is complex, and magnitudes and timescales of landscape change are poorly constrained. Herein, a remotely sensed time series of modern terrace formation is investigated from the Laguna del Viedma valley as a modern analogue of Late Quaternary landscape evolution in Patagonia. The aim of the research was to constrain the timing of terrace formation following lake level fall of the Laguna del Viedma over a 35 year period from 1985-2019. The objectives were to: 1) use satellite imagery from 1985-2019 to document glacier and lake changes in the study area; 2) map landforms of the Laguna del Viedma valley; and 3) analyse terrace elevations. In total seven terrace surfaces were distinguished, with the oldest four pre-dating the ALOS PALSAR DEM (February 2000) used. Landform evidence shows the highest, and vegetated, T1 terrace surface (+40-75 m) grades to the highest lake level and was likely the elevation of the valley floor during Holocene neoglacials. Viedma glacier recession then led to a phase of lake regressions/transgressions with an overall trend of lake level fall. The DEM shows similar to 20 m incision from the 1985 floodplain level (T3) to the T4 level floodplain by 2000. This constrains a minimum rate of incision of 1.33 m/yr, however, the satellite time series demonstrates rapid T3 terrace formation, with evidence for mass movements contributing to lateral terrace erosion by 1986. The implications of the data are discussed within the context of the Late Quaternary palaeohydrology of Patagonia where lake level falls of 10s to 100s of metres occurred within many large river systems of the Patagonian Andes from 42-52 degrees S. The data herein demonstrate that base level falls from sudden lake drainage events were likely a major driver of rapid landscape change in Patagonia during deglaciation.																			0718-7106					MAY	2022	49	2					169	184		10.5027/andgeoV49n2-3416	http://dx.doi.org/10.5027/andgeoV49n2-3416													WOS:000827659700002

REVUE D ECOLOGIE-LA TERRE ET LA VIE												The vegetation of Joumine Marsh (National Park of Ichkeul, Tunisia) has been studied from 2005 to 2011 with the aims: (1) to characterize the present-day status of the marsh vegetation based on plant inventories and phytosociological surveys, (2) to identify the influence of interannual hydrological changes on the plant distribution, and (3) to reconstruct, on the basis of previous works, the vegetation dynamics over the past 86 years (1925-2011). Results reveal the regression and sometimes the local extinction of the plants of temporary freshwater habitats, and their replacement by halophilous, cultivation-tolerant, footpath and grazing-tolerant species. Such changes express the artificialisation of the marsh. The mid-term dynamics of Joumine Marsh (1925-2011) is characterized by four periods: (1) before the first hydrological developments realized on the Joumine Wady in 1948, the marsh was dominated by the helophytic formation of Bolboschoenus glaucus and Schoenoplectus litoralis; (2) between 1948 and the putting into service of the Joumine Dam in 1982/83, the helophytic vegetation remained dominant; (3) between 1982-1983 and the summer 2002, because of an inappropriate management of the reservoir (without freshwater release), the salinity of the marsh has considerably increased, triggering the decline of the hydrophilous vegetation and the expansion of salt scrubs of Sarcocornia fruticosa; (4) finally, since autumn 2002, occasional releases of freshwater from the Joumine reservoir and the realization of new hydrological developments on the Joumine ditch lead to the inundation and washing of the marsh. These changes have induced the partial replacement of the salt scrubs by renewed helophytic herbaceous formations. This study reveals the significance of the ratio "hydro-hygrophilous plants/halophilous plants" as an indicator of the health of coastal wetlands. This ratio, as a simple tool for helping the management, may be used at the scale of the entire system lake-marsh of Ichkeul.																			0249-7395					JAN-MAR	2014	69	1					3	23																WOS:000345191800001
J	McLaughlin, MR; Brooks, JP; Adeli, A				McLaughlin, M. R.; Brooks, J. P.; Adeli, A.			A new sampler for stratified lagoon chemical and microbiological assessments	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												A sampler was needed for a spatial and temporal study of microbial and chemical stratification in a large swine manure lagoon that was known to contain zoonotic bacteria. Conventional samplers were limited to collections of surface water samples near the bank or required a manned boat. A new sampler was developed to allow simultaneous collection of multiple samples at different depths, up to 2.3 m, without a manned boat. The sampler was tethered for stability, used remote control (RC) for sample collection, and accommodated rapid replacement of sterile tubing modules and sample containers. The sampler comprised a PVC pontoon with acrylic deck and watertight enclosures, for a 12 VDC gearmotor, to operate the collection module, and vacuum system, to draw samples into reusable autoclavable tubing and 250-mL bottles. Although designed primarily for water samples, the sampler was easily modified to collect sludge. The sampler held a stable position during deployment, created minimal disturbance in the water column, and was readily cleaned and sanitized for transport. The sampler was field tested initially in a shallow fresh water lake and subsequently in a swine manure treatment lagoon. Analyses of water samples from the lagoon tests showed that chemical and bacterial levels, pH, and EC did not differ between 0.04, 0.47, and 1.0 m depths, but some chemical and bacterial levels differed between winter and spring collections. These results demonstrated the utility of the sampler and suggested that future manure lagoon studies employ fewer or different depths and more sampling dates.

JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												1. In a system where depletion drives a habitat shift, the hypothesis was tested that animals switch habitat as soon as the average daily net energy intake (or gain) drops below that attainable in the alternative habitat. 2. The study was performed in the Lauwersmeer area. Upon arrival during the autumn migration, Bewick's swans first feed on below-ground tubers of fennel pondweed on the lake, but subsequently switched to feeding on harvest remains in sugar beet fields. 3. The daily energy intake was estimated by multiplying the average time spent foraging per day with the instantaneous energy intake rate while foraging. In the case of pondweed feeding, the latter was estimated from the functional response and the depletion of tuber biomass. In the case of beet feeding, it was estimated from dropping production rate. Gross energy intake was converted to metabolizable energy intake using the assimilation as determined in digestion trials. The daily energy expenditure was estimated by the time-energy budget method. Energetic costs were determined using heart rate. 4. The daily gain of pondweed feeding at the median date of the habitat switch (i.e. when 50% of the swans had switched) was compared with that of beet feeding. The daily gain of beet feeding was calculated for two strategies depending on the night activity on the lake: additional pondweed feeding (mixed feeding) or sleeping (pure beet feeding). 5. The majority of the swans switched when the daily gain they could achieve by staying on the pondweed bed fell just below the average daily gain of pure beet feeders. However, mixed feeders would attain an average daily gain considerably above that of pondweed feeders. A sensitivity analysis showed that this result was robust. 6. We therefore reject the hypothesis that the habitat switch by swans can be explained by simple long-term energy rate maximization. State-dependency, predation risk, and protein requirements are put forward as explanations for the delay in habitat switch.

A Holocene Perspective of Vegetation Controls on Seasonal Boreal Wildfire Sizes Using Numerical Paleo-Ecology	FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE												Wildland fire is the most important disturbance in the boreal forests of eastern North America, shaping the floral composition, structure and spatial arrangement. Although the long-term evolution of the frequency and quantity of burned biomass in these forests can be estimated from paleo-ecological studies, we know little about the evolution of fire sizes. We have therefore developed a methodological approach that provides insights into the processes and changes involved over time in the historical fire-vegetation-climate environment of the coniferous forests (CF) and mixedwood forests (MF) of eastern boreal North America, paying particular attention to the metric of fire size. Lacustrine charcoal particles sequestered in sediments from MF and CF regions were analyzed to reconstruct changes in estimated burned biomass, fire frequency, and their ratio interpreted as fire size (FS-index), over the last 7,000 years. A fire propagation model was used to simulate past fire sizes using both a reference landscape, where MF and CF compositions over time were prescribed using pollen reconstructions, and climate inputs provided by the HadCM3BL-M1 snapshot simulations. Lacustrine charcoals showed that Holocene FS-indices did not differ significantly between MF and CF because of the high variability in fire frequencies. However, the estimated burned biomass from MF was always lower than that from CF, significantly so since 5,000 BP. Beyond the variability, the FS-index was lower in MF than CF throughout the Holocene, with slight changes in both forests from 7,000 to 1,000 BP, and simultaneous increases over the last millennium. The fire model showed that MF fires were consistently smaller than CF fires throughout the Holocene, with larger differences in the past than today. The fire model also highlighted the fact that spring fires in both forest types have always been larger than summer fires over the last 7,000 years, which concurs with present-day fire statistics. This study illustrates how fire models, built and used today for forecasting and firefighting, can also be used to enhance our understanding of past conditions within the fire-vegetation-climate nexus.

J	Zhao, WW; Zhao, Y; Qin, F				Zhao, Wenwei; Zhao, Yan; Qin, Feng			Holocene fire, vegetation, and climate dynamics inferred from charcoal and pollen record in the eastern Tibetan Plateau	JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES												Understanding fire history and its driving mechanisms can provide valuable insights into present fire regime (intensity, severity and frequency), the interplay between vegetation and fire, and trigger of fire activities. Here we reconstruct the Holocene fire history in the Zoige Basin on the eastern Tibetan Plateau, on the basis of sedimentary micro-charcoal record over the last 10.0 ka (1 ka = 1000 cal yr BP) and discuss the influences of vegetation and climate on fire dynamics. Our results show that regional fire was active at 10.0-3.3 ka and a significant decrease in fire activity characterized the period after 3.3 ka. The high regional fire frequency at 10.0-3.3 ka is consistent with the forested landscape suggested by high affinity scores of cool mixed forest biome (mainly consisted of spruce), implying that fire dynamics during this period was generally controlled by the variations of arboreal biomass and summer temperature. During 6.3-4.6 ka the prevailing Asian summer monsoon provided increased moisture to this region and thus suppressed fire activities to an extent, despite the availability of abundant biomass. Declined tree biomass after 3.3 ka probably accounted for the decreased fire activities. In addition, two successive fire events at ca. 3.5-3.3 ka were likely responsible for the subsequent abrupt decline of forest components in the landscape.

Here, we examine the Q ((r)) composition metric to demonstrate local to regional scale human effects on natural distribution of phytoplankton along the River Loire. Distribution of phytoplankton functional groups coupled with chemical and physical parameters are described at whole river scale (19 stations, between March and November 2009). Natural longitudinal changes were reflected by the switch from benthic Pennales (T (B) ) towards meroplanktic greens (J) via unicellular centric diatoms (D/C). While upstream human pressure was mostly associated to species indicating eutrophic, stagnant environments (coda P, M, H1, Y), downstream attenuation of the Q ((r)) reflected enriched, shallow environments with prolonged residence time (coda J, X2, X1). Occurrence of minimum Q ((r)) index values were synchronized to late summer, but the longer was the distance from the source, the earlier was the seasonal decrease of Q ((r)). Increasing downstream co-dominance of codon F evidenced an ascending light availability in summer. The longitudinal distribution of functional groups allowed us to conclude that functional diversity might be able to sign human-affected richness, while simply species diversity does not.

Volcanic lakes of the Azores archipelago (Portugal):: Geological setting and geochemical characterization	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												A representative set of 30 lakes from the Azores archipelago (Portugal) has been studied to obtain data on their volcanic setting and water geochemistry. The majority of the studied lakes are located inside volcanic craters and subsidence calderas, while the remaining lakes are located in topographic depressions not associated with volcanic centres, in depressions of tectonic origin and inside lava caves. In general, the Azorean volcanic lakes are small, with surface areas between 8.94 x 10(-4) km(2) and 4.35 km(2) and volumes between 2.4 x 10(3) and 4.78 x 10(7) m(3); median = 3.99 x 10(4) m(3), presenting maximum depths between 0.8 and 33 m. Mostly of the Na-Cl to Na-HCO3 type, the lake waters are generally low temperature (11.9-24.6 degrees C), very dilute (TDS range between 11.0 and 356.2 mg/L; median = 36.8 mg/L) and a clear exception is Furna do Enxofre lake (Graciosa island) that shows a Mg trend. Two types of lake waters can be recognized: 1) one is characterized by Na/Cl ratio close to the seawater value and have evolved, and evolve by marine contribution; and 2) Na-HCO3 type waters that, in addition to sea-salt input, have been influenced by other processes (e.g., water-rock interaction, hydrothermal seepage into the lake bottom) evident from higher total CO2 content (365.1 mg/L) and SiO2 content (74.9 mg/L), as well demonstrated by in the Furna do Enxofre lake. Nevertheless, volcanic contribution cannot be excluded for some takes as Furna do Enxofre. Vertical profiles made at the deepest lakes of Sao Miguel reveal that major-ion content varies little with depth, largely independent of the occurrence of thermally driven density stratification in summer for some lakes. However, dissolved CO2 increases with depth and is kept in the hypolimnion in summer, whereas the HCO3 content is stable, suggesting that CO2 release exceeds acidity neutralization by water-rock interaction. During winter, without stratification, the dissolved CO2 increase is less sharp for the majority of the lakes, with the exception of Furnas and Furna do Enxofre lakes. The CO2 enrichment observed for certain lakes (e.g., Furna do Enxofre and Furnas) implies a volcanic input. Moreover, as these lakes themselves are located near hydrothermal surface manifestations, they therefore offer good targets of volcano monitoring in the Azores. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This study focused on phytoplankton variations in relation to seasonal environmental changes on a multiannual time scale (2006-2015) at a Mediterranean eutrophic reservoir (Bidighinzu Lake, Italy) belonging to the Italian, European and International Long Term Ecological Research networks. Phytoplankton cell density, volume and biomass and chlorophyll a concentrations were analysed together with meteo-climatic, hydrological, physical and chemical variables to detect trends and correlations. The period under study was also compared with previous years to assess the presence of significant differences in the environmental and planktonic compartments. Multiannual changes were more pronounced in summer than in the other seasons during the decade under study. The most conspicuous environmental changes were a significant decrease in summer nutrient concentrations in the reservoir and a simultaneous anthropic pressure reduction in the watershed. In addition, the mixing zone and euphotic zone ratio also increased. Multiannual changes in summer phytoplankton composition consisted of an increased density of smaller Bacillariophyceae and Cyanophyceae, which replaced larger species of the same phytoplankton classes. This resulted in opposite trends of total phytoplankton cell density (increasing) and mean phytoplankton cell volume (decreasing) over the study years. The nutrient decrement was statistically the strongest environmental driver of the phytoplankton changes observed in the reservoir. However, the mixing zone and the euphotic zone ratio and water temperature also significantly affected the multiannual phytoplankton variations. Therefore, we conclude that the success of small cell-sized phytoplankton in Bidighinzu Lake was most probably due to the synergic interactions of more environmental forces related to changing anthropic pressures and climate variability. Our results highlight the importance of long-term monitoring of reservoirs in the Mediterranean basin, especially in semi-arid regions where the need and scarcity of high quality water will be further exacerbated due to the global climate change.

How Might Changing Fishery Practices and Climate Affect the Lake St. Clair Muskellunge Fishery?	MUSKELLUNGE MANAGEMENT: FIFTY YEARS OF COOPERATION AMONG ANGLERS, SCIENTISTS, AND FISHERIES BIOLOGISTS	American Fisheries Society Symposium				Hugh C Becker Memorial Muskie Symposium: 50 Years of Cooperation - Anglers, Science and Management	MAR 13-15, 2016	Minnetonka, MN	Hugh C Becker Fdn, Muskies Inc, Amer Fisheries Soc, N Central Div, Esocid Tech Comm				The current Lake St. Clair Great Lakes Muskellunge Esox masquinongy fishery is entirely self-sustaining and dominated by a catch-and-release ethic. Catch rates of Lake St. Clair Muskellunge are among the highest documented for this species, and angler catches of trophy Muskellunge are considered relatively commonplace. The proximity of Lake St. Clair to many potential new Muskelluhge anglers, interest among some anglers in restoring a long-prohibited winter spear fishery, and warming temperatures associated with climate change pose potential threats to the quality of this fishery. We developed an age-structured equilibrium yield model to project the likely effects of altered size and harvest limits, increased angling effort, establishment of a winter spearing season, or warming temperatures on open-water angling catch rates of three. size-classes of Lake St. Clair Muskellunge (all fish age 1, legal-sized fish > 107 cm, and trophy-sized fish > 127 cm). Our modeling indicated that changes in regulations in the Lake St. Clair Muskellunge fishery were unlikely to result in substantial changes to catch rates of Muskellunge of any size-class. Similarly, the current high rate of voluntary release would largely buffer catch rates of all size-classes of Lake St. Clair Muskellunge from increases in fishing effort. Our simulation of a winter spearing fishery indicated that only high levels of spearing effort and harvest would reduce open-water catch rates to a degree that would likely be objectionable to anglers. In contrast, the predicted catch rates of legal-and trophy-sized fish were highly sensitive to modeled reductions in growth. As such, the major threat to this trophy Muskellunge fishery appears largely outside the traditional toolbox of fisheries managers, hastening the need for development of resilient management and monitoring plans for this valuable fishery.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-46-2				2017	85						303	335																WOS:000422891800030
J	Lasry, F; Coll, I; Buisson, E				Lasry, F; Coll, I; Buisson, E			An insight into the formation of severe ozone episodes: modeling the 21/03/01 event in the ESCOMPTE region	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												High ozone concentrations are observed more and more frequently in the lower troposphere. The development of such polluted episodes is linked to a complex set of chemical, physical and dynamical parameters that interact with each other. To improve air quality, it is necessary to understand and quantify the role of all these processes on the intensity of ozone formation. The ESCOMPTE program, especially dedicated to the numerical simulation of photochemical episodes, offers an ideal frame to investigate details of the roles of many of these processes through 3D modeling. This paper presents the analysis, with a 3D eulerian model, of a severe and local episode of ozone pollution that occurred on the 21st of March 2001 in the ESCOMPTE region. This episode is particularly interesting due to the intensity of the observed ozone peaks (450 mug/m(3) during 15 mn) but also because it did not occur in summer but at the beginning of spring. As part of the premodeling work of the ESCOMPTE program, this study focuses on the sensitivity of the simulated ozone peaks to various chemical and physical phenomena (long-range transport, industrial emissions, local dynamic phenomena...) to determine their influence on the rise of high local photooxidant concentrations and to better picture the photochemistry of the ESCOMPTE region. Through sensitivity tests to dynamical calculation resolution and emissions, this paper shows how the combination of sea and pond breezes with emissions of reactive VOCs can generate local intense ozone peaks.

Anticipating the consequences of climate change for Canada's boreal forest ecosystems	ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS												Canadian boreal woodlands and forests cover approximately 3.09 x 10(6) km(2), located within a larger boreal zone characterized by cool summers and long cold winters. Warming since the 1850s, increases in annual mean temperature of at least 2 degrees C between 2000 and 2050 are highly probable. Annual mean temperatures across the Canadian boreal zone could be 4-5 degrees C warmer than today's by 2100. All aspects of boreal forest ecosystem function are likely to be affected. Further, several potential "tipping elements" - where exposure to increasing changes in climate may trigger distinct shifts in ecosystem state - can be identified across the Canadian boreal zone. Approximately 40% of the forested area is underlain by permafrost, some of which is already degrading irreversibly, triggering a process of forest decline and re-establishment lasting several decades, while also releasing significant quantities of greenhouse gases that will amplify the future global warming trend. Warmer temperatures coupled with significant changes in the distribution and timing of annual precipitation are likely to cause serious tree-killing droughts in the west; east of the Great Lakes, however, where precipitation is generally nonlimiting, warming coupled with increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide may stimulate higher forest productivity. Large wildfires, which can cause serious economic losses, are expected to become more frequent, but increases in mean annual area burned will be relatively gradual. The most immediate threats could come from endemic forest insect pests that have the potential for population outbreaks in response to relatively small temperature increases. Quantifying the multiple effects of climate change will be challenging, particularly because there are great uncertainties attached to possible interactions among them, as well as with other land-use pressures. Considerable ingenuity will be needed from forest managers and scientists to address the formidable challenges posed by climate change to boreal ecosystems and develop effective strategies to adapt sustainable forest management practices to the impending changes.

J	Quist, MC; Guy, CS; Stephen, JL				Quist, MC; Guy, CS; Stephen, JL			Recruitment dynamics of walleyes (Stizostedion vitreum) in Kansas reservoirs: generalities with natural systems and effects of a centrarchid predator	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Knowledge of factors influencing recruitment dynamics of walleyes (Stizostedion vitreum) in different systems and regions is important for developing a better understanding of walleye ecology. Therefore, we investigated associations among walleye recruitment and climatic, water-level, and biotic characteristics in four Kansas reservoirs during 1985-1999. Walleye recruitment was positively related to spring storage ratios and temperatures and negatively associated with spring water levels and abundance of 130- to 199-mm white crappies (Pomoxis annularis). The influence of juvenile white crappie predation on larval walleyes was examined by conducting a manipulative experiment. Regardless of zooplankton density or water clarity, mortality of larval walleyes resulting from white crappie predation was over 90%. Based on our empirical and experimental results, we propose a biotic-abiotic confining hypothesis (BACH) to explain abiotic and biotic effects on walleye recruitment dynamics. Specifically, high variability in walleye recruitment was observed during years with low densities of 130- to 199-mm white crappies and likely resulted from the effects of abiotic factors. When white crappie abundance was high, walleye recruitment was low and exhibited little variability, suggesting that white crappies can have an overriding influence on walleye recruitment regardless of abiotic conditions.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JUL	2003	60	7					830	839		10.1139/F03-067	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F03-067													WOS:000185215700007
J	Smith, CD; Yang, DQ; Ross, A; Barr, A				Smith, Craig D.; Yang, Daqing; Ross, Amber; Barr, Alan			The Environment and Climate Change Canada solid precipitation intercomparison data from Bratt's Lake and Caribou Creek, Saskatchewan	EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA												Prior to the beginning of the World Meteorological Organization's (WMO) Solid Precipitation InterComparison Experiment (SPICE, 2013-2015), two precipitation measurement intercomparison sites were established in Saskatchewan to help assess the systematic bias in the automated gauge measurement of solid precipitation and the impact of wind on the undercatch of snow. Caribou Creek, located in the southern boreal forest, and Bratt's Lake, located in the southern plains, are a contribution to the international SPICE project but also to examine national and regional issues in measuring solid precipitation, including regional assessment of wind bias in precipitation gauges and windshield configurations commonly used in Canadian monitoring networks. Overlapping with WMO-SPICE, the Changing Cold Regions Network (CCRN) Special Observation and Analysis Period (SOAP) occurred from 2014 to 2015, involving other enhanced observations and cold regions research projects in the same geographical domain as the Saskatchewan SPICE sites. Following SPICE, the two Saskatchewan sites continued to collect core meteorological data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.) as well as precipitation observations via several automated gauge configurations, including the WMO automated reference and the Meteorological Service of Canada's (MSC) network gauges. In addition, manual snow surveys to collect snow cover depth, density, and water equivalent were completed over the duration of the winter periods at the northern Caribou Creek site. Starting in the fall of 2013, the core intercomparison precipitation and ancillary data continued to be collected through the winter of 2017. Automated observations were obtained at a temporal resolution of 1 min, subjected to a rigorous quality control process, and aggregated to a resolution of 30 min. The manual snow surveys at Caribou Creek were typically performed every second week during the SPICE field program with monthly surveys following the end of the SPICE intercomparison period. The Saskatchewan SPICE data are available at https://doi.org/10.18164/63773b5b-5529-4b1e-9150-10acb84d59f0 (Smith and Yang, 2018). The data collected at the Saskatchewan SPICE sites will continue to be useful for transfer function testing, numerical weather prediction and hydrological forecasting verification, ground truth for remote-sensing applications, as well as providing reference precipitation measurements for other concurrent research applications in the cold regions.

Up to 90% of annual wet deposition of N was stored in the seasonal snowpack; NO3- and NH4+ were released from storage in the form of an ionic pulse, where the first fraction of meltwater draining from the snowpack had concentrations of NO3- and NH4+ as high as 28 mu eg L(-1) compared to bulk concentrations of < 5 mu eq L(-1) in the snowpack. The soil reservoir of organic N (81 keg ha(-1)) was about ten times the N storage in litter and biomass (12 keg ha(-1)). Assimilation of N by vegetation was balanced by the release of N from soil mineralization, nitrification, and litter decay. Mineralization and nitrification processes produced 1.1 keg ha(-1) yr(-1) of inorganic N, about 3 1/2 times the loading of N from wet and dry deposition, Less than 1% of the NH4+ in wet and dry deposition was exported from the basin as NH4+. Biological assimilation was primarily responsible for retention of NH4+ in the basin, releasing one mode of H+ for every mole of NH4+ retained and neutralizing about 25% of the annual acid neutralizing capacity produced by mineral weathering in the basin. Nitrate concentrations in stream waters reached an annual peak during the first part of snowmelt runoff, with maximum concentrations in stream water of 20 mu eq L(-1), more than 4 times the volume-weighted mean annual concentrations of NO3- in wet deposition. This annual peak in stream water NO3- was consistent with the release of NO3- from the snowpack in the form of an ionic pulse; however soil processes occurring underneath the winter snowpack were another potential source of this NO3- Concentrations of stream water NO3- during the summer growing season were always near or below detection limits (0.5 mu eq L(-1)).																			0168-2563						1995	28	1					1	31		10.1007/BF02178059	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02178059													WOS:A1995QJ58300001

To understand the effects of these two parameters on sedimentation, we analyzed the sediment records of four lakes located within former isolated glaciomarine embayments of the northern Champlain Sea basin. These lakes were initially inundated by marine water of the Champlain Sea, following deglaciation, and have subsequently experienced basin isolation owing to glacio-isostatic rebound. Three of these lakes reveal a common litho-and acoustic stratigraphic succession, characterized by an IRD-free glaciomarine to marine facies consisting of homogeneous to faintly laminated clayey silts grading into well-laminated silts with rapidly deposited layers. These two units recorded the transitional environment from glaciomarine sedimentation below multiyear shorefast ice to increased terrestrial runoff and rapid glacio-isostatic rebound once the ice margin retreated inland. During ice margin retreat, relative sea level fell concomitantly resulting in the deposition of coarser sediments in marine embayments. Upon the complete retreat of the ice margin, the supply of terrestrial sediments diminished and lake isolation, driven by relative sea level fall, led to higher biogenic content and increased biotur-bation. This study provides a framework for sedimentation in isolated glaciomarine embayments which differs from deep-water sedimentation owing to the presence of shorefast sea-ice and their protected location from major ice-stream outlets.

J	Ryan, J; Masri, S; Qadir, M				Ryan, John; Masri, Samir; Qadir, Manzoor			Nutrient monitoring of sewage water irrigation: Impacts for soil quality and crop nutrition	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS												Agriculture in the Middle East region, specifically crop production (mainly cereals and food and forage legumes), is invariably limited by low rainfall and thus soil moisture. Although irrigation is contributing to increased yields, its potential is also limited because of few surface-water sources (rivers, lakes) and declining groundwater tables. The only source of water that is increasing is urban wastewater. Such waters are rarely treated in the Middle East but are nonetheless used for irrigation in perimeters of urban areas. Despite the potential health hazards of using such waters, crop benefits are evident to farmers. This study involved monitoring of the Quake River, south of Aleppo, Syria, where it irrigates about 10,000 ha of mixed crops (e.g., cotton, cereals, oil crops, and vegetables). The water was sampled at various points along the river in winter and summer (1997-98) and again 6 years later (2003) and analyzed for nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, potassium (K), micronutrients, salinity, and pH. A similar suite of analyses, plus organic matter, was done on soil profiles along the river and progressively away from it. The river water was rich in major and micronutrients and, with normal irrigation amounts, was sufficient to supply the needs of most crops, thus avoiding fertilizer use. These nutrients increased in the soil profiles with time. The nutrient value of such untreated wastewater, as well as being a source of irrigation water, re-enforces the argument for treatment plants to promote the safe use of this valuable resource in a drought-prone and nutrient-deficient region.

J	Levesque, AJ; Cwynar, LC; Walker, IR				Levesque, AJ; Cwynar, LC; Walker, IR			Exceptionally steep north south gradients in lake temperatures during the last deglaciation	NATURE												During the transition from the last glacial to the present interglacial climate (late-glacial period), high summer insolation(1) combined with the presence of the Laurentide ice sheet is thought to have promoted the development of strong summer thermal gradients in North America south of the ice margin(2). Here we use palaeoecological methods to obtain quantitative evidence for the existence of these gradients. Our palaeoclimate reconstructions are based on water temperatures inferred from fossil assemblages of aquatic midge larvae in five lakes along a 240-km transect, extending from central New Brunswick, Canada, to southeastern Maine, USA. We show that the temperature gradient shifted during the Killarney Oscillation (KO) and Younger Dryas (YD) cooling events, and that water temperature differences of 9 and 11 degrees C existed over distances of 55 and 240 km, respectively, during parts of the late-glacial period. These gradients are much stronger than the current north-south trends of lake summer surface water temperatures for these five lakes and for lakes across the northern tree line. The rapid motion of such steep temperature gradients may have affected the progressive development of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in the region.

The study was made possible when the northern part of the lagoon was enclosed by polder dikes prior to land reclamation for agricultural purposes. The disappearance of the halocline allowed vertical mixing to extend to the whole depth and vertical gradients in water properties then decreased remarkably. Despite the disappearance of the halocline, dissolved oxygen content of bottom waters decreased considerably during summer months. Summer peaks in inorganic nitrogen and phosphate were still observed after disappearance of the halocline.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR 20	1987	146	2					181	186		10.1007/BF00008766	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008766													WOS:A1987G689900003

To explore these relationships, a resuspension framework, including surficial/core sediments and settling trap-collected particles (TCPs), was assessed in the Jiaozhou Bay (JZB) to examine the behavior and fate of particulate biogenic elements (C, N, P and Si). Resuspension-mediated differences in the concentrations of numerous biogenic proxies were significant and mainly corresponded to selective upwelling of fine-sized, nutrient-enriched particles, to autochthonous organic matter degradation below the trap-deployed level comprising water column transportation and long-term retention at the sediment-water interface. This is further reinforced by smaller inorganic carbon concentrations in sediments and origin-indicating stoichiometric ratio records (OC:ON, OC:OP). Nevertheless, biogenic silica (BSi) exhibited a near homologous concentration and had the largest preservation efficiency. Three principal components, representing production and preservation, remineralisation, and a particle-size effect, accounted for 55.5%, 14.0%, and 9.1% of the total variance, respectively. After calibration, the primary sinking flux was two orders of magnitude smaller than the measured absolute sedimenting flux. Also, the limited bottom achieving contribution with a maximum of 28.3% for freshly biogenic particles produced in autumn/winter circumstances with low primary productivity was inferred. The recurrent resuspension processes in JZB demonstrated that 5-12 cycles of similar or higher intensity resuspension was required before freshly-formed biogenic particles could ultimately be integrated into the sediments. Regarding the internal P sink-switching mechanism, the previously transformed Fe-bound fraction across the estuarine salinity gradient has limited application under offshore redox oscillations, whereas near-quantitative transfer of dissolved P from remineralized organic matter to authigenic carbonate fluorapatite could substantially reduce its bio-availability in resuspended particulate P.

The main purpose of the study was to identify groundwater outflows across the fringe zone of Lake Wieprznickie as well as their hydrochemical characterization. Studies were conducted four times per year in the period from November 2010 to October 2013 for three hydrologic years. Fieldwork has shown the presence of 9 groundwater outflows northwest of the studied lake. The elevation of the outflows ranged from 150 to 155 meters. The outflows were found to be hillslope outflows that yield water continuously throughout the study period. The total mean discharge for all 9 outflows was 0.73 dm(3).s(-1), which can be regarded as weak and average. The obtained results indicate that groundwater outflows to the Lake Wieprznickie provide 4% of the lake's volume. Most outflows created clusters of two or three outflows that formed the spring. Physical conditions such as specific conductivity and water temperature were subject to significant seasonal changes, while large stabilization was observed at individual measuring points. Total mineral content ranged from 320 to 610 mg.dm(-3). Calcium was the main cation identified in the study and bicarbonate was the main anion, which is characteristic of shallow groundwater.

The effect of Echinorhynchus borealis (acanthocephala) infection on the anti-predator behavior of a benthic amphipod	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY												In benthic habitats, predators can generally not be detected visually, so olfaction may be particularly important for inducing anti-predation behaviors in prey organisms. Manipulative parasites infecting benthic hosts could suppress these responses so as to increase the probability of predation and thus trophic transmission. We studied how infection with the acanthocephalan Echinorhynchus borealis affects the response of the benthic amphipod Pallasea quadrispinosa to water conditioned by burbot (Lota lota), the parasite's definitive host. In normal lake water, refuge use by infected and uninfected amphipods was similar, but when exposed to burbot-conditioned water, uninfected amphipods spent much more time hiding than infected amphipods. Thus, rather than affecting ambient hiding behavior, E. borealis infection seems to alter host response to a predator. A group of amphipods sampled from a postglacial spring that is devoid of fish predators exhibited only a weak response to burbot-conditioned water. perhaps suggesting these anti-predator behaviors are costly to maintain. The hiding behavior of spring and infected amphipods was very similar. If the reduced refuge use by the spring amphipods reflects adaptation to a predator-free environment, this indicates that E. borealis severely weakens its host's anti-predator behavior.

Changes to a Brown Trout Population after Introducing Steelhead in a Michigan Stream	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We evaluated the effects of steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss (migratory Rainbow Trout) introduction on the population dynamics of resident Brown Trout Salmo trutta from 1995 to 2008 in a small, low-gradient trout stream. Data on Brown Trout population density, survival, and growth were collected from the treatment section in Hunt Creek, Michigan, where adult steelhead were stocked each spring during 1998-2003, as well as from two reference stream reaches. The presence of steelhead had no apparent effect on the density of age-0 Brown Trout, but the mean density of all age-1 and older (age-1+) Brown Trout year-classes that interacted with juvenile steelhead of the same age was 46% lower than the density of age-1+ year-classes that did not interact with juvenile steelhead of the same age. No differences in density of age-1+ Brown Trout were detected in reference sections between the periods of steelhead presence or absence in the treatment section. Lower annual survival rates for year-classes of age-0 Brown Trout that interacted with steelhead in the Hunt Creek treatment section were the primary reason that density of age-1+ Brown Trout fell to nearly half the levels that existed before steelhead were introduced or after most steelhead had emigrated from the stream. Although our case study showed that the introduction of steelhead into a small, low-gradient stream resulted in lower densities of resident Brown Trout, upstream passage of steelhead into streams with high-quality habitat also offers tremendous potential to increase wild production of juvenile steelhead, thereby reducing fisheries managers' reliance on hatchery-reared fish for stocking the Great Lakes.

Predation by fallfish (Semotilus corporalis) on Pacific salmon eggs in the Salmon River, New York	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Fallfish (Semotilus corporalis) are the largest native cyprinid in the northeastern United States and are the most abundant native species in the Salmon River, New York. The Salmon River is a high-quality spawning and nursery river for Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) migrating from Lake Ontario. Because of the large number of Pacific salmon spawning in the river in the fall extensive redd superimposition occurs resulting in salmonid eggs being available on the substrate. We examined the fall diet of 647 fallfish in 2007 and 2008 to determine the extent of predation on Pacific salmon eggs. The contribution of eggs in the diet significantly increased once fallfish attained a size of 100 mm total length. The largest size category of fallfish examined (>= 150 mm) had the highest proportion (86.1%) of salmon eggs in their diet. The contribution of zooplankton and chironomids in the diet of fallfish decreased with fish size. Except for the two largest groups of fallfish examined (i.e., 100-149 mm and >= 150 mm) diet overlap among size groups was low. The high contribution in the diet during the fall and high caloric value of Pacific salmon eggs could increase growth and survival of this species in the Salmon River. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

DATA-MODEL COMPARISON AT 9000 YEARS BP	PALEOCEANOGRAPHY												Theoretical investigations, in the form of general circulation model (GCM) simulations and empirical studies of pollen, lake levels, and marine sediments suggest that the Indian summer monsoon was intensified 9000 years ago, at a time of increased summer radiation (about 8%) in the northern hemisphere. The southwesterly summer monsoon winds and their pattern of wind stress curl cause coastal upwelling along the coast of Arabia. Stronger summer winds, therefore, should intensify coastal upwelling. Incorporation of the broad-scale GCM winds into a high-resolution ocean model of the Arabian Sea produces distinct patterns of stronger upwelling at 9000 years B.P. To verify these patterns in the geologic record, we mapped upwelling assemblages of planktonic foraminifera and estimated sea surface temperature (SST) to define the magnitude and spatial distribution of monsoonal upwelling at 9000 years B.P. We found that the upwelling assemblage increased in abundance and the August SSTs were several degrees Celsius cooler off Arabia than present. However, in the central and eastern Arabian Sea the tropical assemblage increased and the SSTs were warmer than present values. The SST gradient across the Arabian Sea was greater (6 degrees C) at 9000 years B. P. than it is today (4 degrees C). These observations are consistent with the model results that show increase divergence, upwelling, and a thinner upper layer or shallower thermocline in the westernmost Arabian Sea and increased convergence, downwelling, and a thicker upper layer in the central and eastern Arabian Sea. In this experiment, the use of low resolution winds from a general circulation model (NCAR-CCM) in a high-resolution ocean model seems to be appropriate for simulating the long-term averages observed in the marine sediments.																			0883-8305					JUN	1990	5	3					447	457		10.1029/PA005i003p00447	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/PA005i003p00447													WOS:000208338700015

Zooplankton community was dominated by rotifers followed by copepods during the study period. Horizontal distribution of both invertebrate taxa differed; rotifers most abundant in the western and eastern parts of the lake in February-March, and cyclopoid copepodids and nauplii more common in the northest area of the eastern portion of the lake. The number and feeding activity of Shovelers increased from January to March in the northeast area of Lake Teganuma. A Shoveler captured in the area had mostly consumed cyclopoid copepodids despite the fact that rotifers dominated in the zooplankton community at that location. These results suggest that the horizontal distribution and feeding activity of the Shovelers were correlated with the distribution of the cyclopoid copepodids.																			0018-8158					DEC 16	1994	294	3					253	261		10.1007/BF00021298	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00021298													WOS:A1994QG90700009
J	Mitrovic, SM; Hardwick, L; Dorani, F				Mitrovic, Simon M.; Hardwick, Lorraine; Dorani, Forugh			Use of flow management to mitigate cyanobacterial blooms in the Lower Darling River, Australia	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The growth of planktonic cyanobacteria in a weir pool on the Lower Darling River, Australia, downstream of the major regulated Menindee Lake system was examined. Blooms of the saxitoxin producing freshwater cyanobacterium Anabaena circinalis occurred for two summers out of four studied. Large cell numbers of other cyanobacteria including Aphanizomenon, Planktolyngbya and Merismopedia also occurred during the same summer periods as the Anabaena blooms. The growth events also coincided with periods of improved light climate. Flow releases from the regulated Menindee Lakes System were assessed for their ability to either suppress bloom development or to mitigate pre-existing blooms over this period. A discharge of 300 ML/day (flow velocity of 0.03 m/s) was found to be sufficient to prevent prolonged periods of persistent thermal stratification, which also suppressed the development of A. circinalis blooms. A flow release of 3000 ML/day was effective at removing an established cyanobacterial bloom, and total cyanobacterial numbers declined from over 100 000 to <1000 cells/mL within a week. In two summers without blooms, higher flows and decreased light availability prevented the development of cyanobacterial blooms. Flow releases were effective at mitigating cyanobacterial growth through either the suppression of persistent thermal stratification or through dilution and translocation of cells. Greater discharges also increased turbidity, which diminished the growth of cyanobacteria through reduced light availability under the mixed conditions, which also reduced the ability for surface migration through buoyancy regulation. The volume of water required for different management strategies varied and is considered in terms of environmental allocations.					; Mitrovic, Simon/A-7225-2012	Hardwick, Lorraine/0000-0002-9612-4862; Mitrovic, Simon/0000-0002-5528-2215; 													0142-7873	1464-3774				FEB	2011	33	2					229	241		10.1093/plankt/fbq094	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbq094													WOS:000286953500003

Inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus in Sierran forest O horizon leachate	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												High in situ concentrations of inorganic N and P have been reported in overland/litter interflow from Sierran forests, indicating that these nutrients are derived from the forest floor 0 horizons. To test this hypothesis, forest floor monoliths consisting of the combined 0, and O-i horizons were collected near the South Shore of Lake Tahoe, Nevada, for leaching experiments. Three monoliths were left intact, and three were hand-separated according to horizon for a total of three treatments (combined O-e+O-i, O-e only, and O-i only) by three replications. Samples were randomized and placed into lined leaching bins. Initial leaching consisted of misting to simulate typical early fall precipitation. This was followed by daily snow applications and a final misting to simulate spring precipitation. Leachate was collected, analyzed for NH4+-N, NO3--N, and PO43--P, and a nutrient balance was computed. There was a net retention of NH4+-N, but a net release of both NO3--N and PO43--P, and a net release of inorganic N and P overall. Total contributions (mg) of N and P were highest from the O-e and O-e + O-i combined treatments, but when expressed as per unit mass, significantly (p < 0.05) higher amounts of NO3--N and PO43--p were derived from the O-i materials. The nutrients in forest floor leachate are a potential source of biologically available N and P to adjacent surface waters. Transport of these nutrients from the terrestrial to the aquatic system in the Lake Tahoe basin may therefore play a part in the already deteriorating clarity of the lake.																			0047-2425	1537-2537				MAR-APR	2007	36	2					498	507		10.2134/jeq2005.0465	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2005.0465								17332254					WOS:000244979300018

Population estimates that are derived from such surveys may be erroneous if the size composition of the fish observed by divers differs from that of the entire population. Forty-four adult smallmouth bass of three size classes were radio-tagged and tracked during the summer of 1993 (mid June to early September) in Green Lake, Maine, USA, to investigate possible site-related error from observations by divers being towed along the lake shore. Our results indicate that scuba divers may fail to count a significant portion of large smallmouth bass during late summer (mid July to early September), compared to small-or medium-sized fish. The results suggest that scuba surveys should be conducted during early summer (mid June to mid July) to derive more accurate population estimates.

J	Overmann, J; Beatty, JT; Krouse, HR; Hall, KJ				Overmann, J; Beatty, JT; Krouse, HR; Hall, KJ			The sulfur cycle in the chemocline of a meromictic salt lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												An extremely dense layer of the purple sulfur bacterium Amoebobacter purpureus in the chemocline of meromictic Mahoney Lake (British Columbia) was investigated over a 2-yr period. Within this layer, sulfide, elemental sulfur, and polysulfides were the main species of reduced sulfur. The oxidative part of the sulfur cycle was dominated by anoxygenic photosynthesis of A. purpureus. During summer, when sulfide concentrations in the layer were limiting, intracellular sulfur became the main electron donor for photosynthesis. delta(34)S determinations revealed that the intracellular sulfur reacts chemically with dissolved sulfide to form polysulfides. Polysulfide concentrations decreased over summer, accompanied by an increase in numbers of sulfur-reducing bacteria. Sulfate reduction was the major pathway of sulfide formation. The annual carbon requirement of sulfate-reducing bacteria in the chemocline (22.5 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) was met by the photosynthetic C fixation of A. purpureus (33.5 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Carbon demand exceeded the concomitant C fixation temporarily in summer, however. The activities of biomass-degrading enzymes and the formation of volatile fatty acids were sufficient to provide the carbon substrates. Our data indicate that in Mahoney Lake, anoxygenic photosynthesis and sulfate reduction are only indirectly coupled via degradation and autolysis of photosynthetically formed biomass.

Here we use air photos and satellite imagery to describe lake formation, and the timing of filling and draining, since the 1930s. Between the 1930s and late 1980s, lakes were typically small (<0.6 km(2)), took many years to form after a surge event, and drained slowly as they were displaced by the glacier advancing in the next surge. However, since 1993, the lakes have become larger (>1 km(2)) and drain rapidly through or under the glacier by breaking a terminal ice dam. For the past two surges, since 2001, the lakes formed during or immediately after a surge in an increasingly larger basin between the Neoglacial maximum moraine and an increasingly smaller maximum terminus extent. Most recently, the 2012-2014 surge created a lake that drained in summer 2017, refilled, and drained again in both summer 2018 and summer 2019. The 2019 lake was 2.2 km(2), the largest on record, and drained entirely within 2 days. While a lake is unlikely to form again before the next expected surge in the mid-2020s, future surges of Dan ZhOr Glacier are still likely to create terminal lakes, necessitating continued monitoring for surge activity and lake formation.

A suite of 22 lakes that thermally stratify was measured in the summer of 2013; a sub-set of eight of the lakes was measured again in 2014, which was a warmer summer than 2013. Regression analysis of the 22 lakes indicated that the 1% attenuation depth for photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was the strongest single predictor (R-2 = 0.75) of epilimnion thickness across lakes; the addition of epilimnion temperature to the PAR model explained additional variability (R-2 = 0.79). The importance of including temperature in the model was apparent in the results of model validation as well as when comparing across years: while the 1% PAR was 0.4-2 m deeper in 2014 compared with 2013, water temperatures were 2-3 degrees C higher, resulting in July epilimnion thicknesses that were equal to or shallower than in 2013. In these lakes with low color dissolved organic carbon (DOC), multiple factors control the 1% PAR, including absorbance at 440 nm (a(440)), 380 nm (a(380)), and 320 (a(320)), chlorophyll a (Chl a) and DOC concentration. In 2014, when 1% PAR was deeper than in 2013, a(380), Chl a and DOC were lower in six of the eight lakes. Our results reveal that the thermal structure of these arctic lakes is under complex control by air temperatures and factors that affect PAR attenuation, particularly Chl a and DOC quality, suggesting that continued warming in the Arctic will have strong effects on lake stratification.					; Osburn, Chris/A-9339-2010	Northington, Robert/0000-0002-1347-0971; Osburn, Christopher/0000-0002-9334-4202; Saros, Jasmine/0000-0002-7652-9985													0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2016	61	4					1530	1542		10.1002/lno.10314	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10314													WOS:000383622900027

Remote sensing is a useful tool for this purpose. A method is presented here to determine and compare the temperature evolution Of water bodies. Thermal IR observations were extracted from NOAA's advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data over the period from April I to August 31, 1994. The IR temperatures were calibrated and adjusted to account for the intervening atmosphere, For each day, 1-km resolution temperature scones were generated for a 1000 x 1000-km rectangular region extending from about 60degreesN, 111degreesW over the northern part of the Canadian Province of Alberta to about 500N, 97degreesW in southern Manitoba. There are 132 water bodies of area larger than 100 km(2) in this study area. The temperature cycle over these water bodies can be decomposed into a straight line with a small positive slope for spring ice break-up, followed by a fitted quadratic curve for the summer temperature variations. The curve fit parameters give information on the transition between ice and ice-free conditions. Data stratification confirms a strong latitudinal influence on the shape of the curves. It was not possible to quantify the effect of water depth. as the depth of most boreal lakes is not known. Instead, a list of fit coefficients for all the water bodies is provided. Once detrended from the quadratic curves, the amplitude of the diurnal cycle and major variations in temperatures of the water bodies can be determined. The detrended water temperature variations are about one-third the magnitude of the detrended air temperature variations from nearby weather stations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The importance of small waterbodies for biodiversity and ecosystem services: implications for policy makers	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Small waterbodies, including ponds and small lakes, low-order streams, ditches and springs, are the most numerous freshwater environments globally, are critical for freshwater biodiversity and are increasingly recognised for their role in ecosystem service delivery. Small waters often represent the best remaining examples of intact freshwater habitats and are the most likely to remain unpolluted, often being a refuge for species which have disappeared from larger, more damaged, waterbodies. Practically all water-related ecosystem services are initially mediated by small waters and some, such as carbon cycling, may be dominated by them. Small waters are exposed to all the threats affecting larger waters, and some experienced only by small waters. Despite this, small waters remain the least investigated part of the water environment and are largely excluded from water management planning. We identify the priorities for research to underpin better protection of small waters and recommend policy actions needed to better integrate small waters into the management of catchments and landscapes. The primary requirements are to identify reliable monitoring programmes for small waters, develop effective measures to protect the biodiversity and ecosystem services they provide and ensure that regulators take full account of this critical part of the water environment.

Thus, it is crucial and urgent to rehabilitate the river flood plain. This paper reviews ecological studies conducted on the Yangtze River floodplain and presents suggestions for conservation and rehabilitation. First, the Yangtze River system is briefly introduced. Formed 23 million years ago, the Yangtze River is ca. 6,300 km in length with a mean annual runoff of 9.6 x 10(11) m(3). Thousands of floodplain lakes are distributed along the mid-lower Yangtze River, and the total area remains 15,770 km(2) at present. Such a river-lake complex ecosystem holds a unique and diverse biota, with ca. 400 hydrophytes and hygrophytes, ca. 170 mollusks, ca. 200 fishes, ca. 400 water birds, and endangered dolphins and porpoises. Second, main threats to the Yangtze River floodplain ecosystem are identified: (1) habitat loss, including river channelization, sharp shrinkage of lake area (ca. 10,000 km(2) since the 1950s), degradation of lakeshore zones, and sand overmining; (2) alternations of hydrological regimes, including construction of ca. 47,000 reservoirs in the whole basin and disconnection of most floodplain lakes from the main stem; (3) water pollution, including eutrophication, heavy metals, and organic pollutants; and (4) overexploitation of biological resources, including overfishing and intensive pen culture. Third, effects of river-lake disconnection on lake ecosystems are summarized on the basis of our studies in the past 20 years. It was found that (1) disconnection is one of the main causes of lake eutrophication; (2) species diversity, biomass, and production of macrophytes and macrobenthos reach maxima at some levels of intermediate river connectivity; (3) disconnection greatly reduces fish species richness of each habitat guild, and natural fish larvae is severely depleted; and (4) disconnection simplifies macroinvertebrate food web structure, and the trophic basis of the simplified food web is more heavily dependent on detritus in disconnected lakes. Last, conservation strategies are proposed. Since the Yangtze River flood plain is a huge integrated system, the biodiversity conservation must be conducted on the whole basin scale. By establishing species-area models of fishes, the minimum protected area of Yangtze-connected lakes is estimated to be ca. 14,400 km(2). It means that at least 8,900 km(2) of disconnected lakes should be reconnected with the Yangtze main stem, and ecohydrological operation of dams and sluices is the feasible approach. Based upon our preliminary studies on environmental flow requirements, the following measures are suggested: (1) lower water levels during spring to improve germination of macrophytes, and control rising rates of water levels during spring-summer to ensure development of macrophytes; and (2) open sluice gates to restore migration routes for juveniles migrating into lakes during April-September and for adults migrating back to the Yangtze main stem during November-December.

However, their effect on human comfort has rarely been evaluated. The conference center for the Shanghai World Expo 2010 is located along the waterfront of the Huangpu River. Over 25 days of high temperatures >= 35 degrees C are predicted during the conference period. Proper planning and construction of littoral zone environments near the waterbodies in the World Expo garden could improve the comfort of visitors. In this study, the effects of the waterbody, vegetation and wind conditions on temperature and humidity in littoral zones were analyzed using on-site measurements and a calculated heat index from the littoral zone of Huansha Lake in Huangxing Park, Shanghai on hot summer days. An index for evaluating human comfort in the littoral zone was then established for use at the Shanghai World Expo This index was tested at an artificial lake in Luxun Park, Shanghai and its effectiveness was Garden. demonstrated. The results showed that during the high temperature hours of a hot summer day, a waterbody can effectively improve human comfort in the littoral zone. The area 10-20 m from the water's edge shows the greatest improvement in thermal comfort.

However, existing delta(18)Oc records in the Indian monsoon region are fragmented in time coverage and/or sampling resolution since the last deglaciation. Also, the climatic interpretation of delta(18)Oc is still obscure. Here, we report a continuous and centennial-resolved leaf wax hydrogen isotope (delta D-wax) record over the past similar to 28 ka from Lugu Lake in Indian-monsoon influenced southwestern China. Our new record shows striking consistency with the well-established delta(18)Oc record in East Asian monsoon-influenced southeastern China, revealing a spatially coherent change and thus a similar physical process in rainfall isotopes in the broader Asian monsoon region. Based on the combination with the TraCE21ka simulation, we propose reconstructed long-term and millennial-scale isotope changes could be influenced by the intensity of local convection along the monsoon trough, which extends from the Indian subcontinent across to the Philippines in summer.					; Cheng, Jun/G-4625-2013	Cheng, Jun/0000-0003-0168-1410; Yan, Hong/0000-0003-1230-096X; Zhao, Cheng/0000-0001-7979-0233													0094-8276	1944-8007				JUN 28	2021	48	12							e2021GL092460	10.1029/2021GL092460	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021GL092460													WOS:000668625500001
J	Elo, AR				Elo, AR			Modelling of summer stratification of morphologically different lakes	NORDIC HYDROLOGY												The use of a one-dimensional lake temperature model was investigated using long series of meteorological input data. These data were mainly based on one station. Effects of morphology on water temperature conditions were considered over this long period. The studied lakes are from the Finnish Lake District. Concerning their dynamics, they are small with areas ranging from 257 km(2) to 0. 14 km(2) with the largest depth about 80 m, but typically less than 50 m. The strength of thermal stratification varies. Verification was made using test summers: for two larger lakes longer periods could be used. Summer stratification periods could finally be resolved satisfactorily, but only after adjusting with data from each lake. For some years the vertical temperature simulations are not as successful as for others, indicating the importance of local weather differences. For lakes with a large area to depth ratio heat is absorbed freely, while when it is small heat is blocked more into the epilimnion. For very small lakes sheltering is essential. Large total volume delays cooling, when stratification prevails. Sheltering is important and also very small lakes cool slowly due to their strong stability.																			0029-1277						2005	36	3					281	294																WOS:000230999700007
J	Finley, TD; Johnston, ST; Unsworth, MJ; Banks, J; Pana, DI				Finley, Theron D.; Johnston, Stephen T.; Unsworth, Martyn J.; Banks, Jonathan; Pana, Dinu-Ion			Modern dextral strain controls active hydrothermal systems in the southeastern Canadian Cordillera	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Thermal springs in the southeastern Canadian Cordillera occur in association with several major fault zones, which may permit deep circulation of fluid through fractured reservoirs to depths greater than 2 km. Both the current stress field and the most recent kinematics of these faults likely play a significant role in localizing hydrothermal upwellings but are poorly resolved. In this paper, we present new data from structural mapping along the Columbia River, Slocan Lake, Purcell Trench, Southern Rocky Mountain Trench, and Redwall faults. Fault plane and slickenfiber orientations measured in the field indicate a previously unidentified, post-Eocene phase of dextral strike-slip kinematics on these faults, which have historically been mapped primarily as Eocene extensional structures. The NE- SW maximum principal stress required for these kinematics shares a similar orientation to the present-day stress field derived from crustal earthquake focal mechanisms, which suggests dextral slip may be a recent and ongoing development that continues at the present time. On a regional scale, there is a positive correlation between the locations of springs and regions with elevated seismicity. At the local scale, geothermal upwellings may be controlled by local zones of enhanced permeability including fault intersections and strain-transfer zones. The identification of favorable structural settings may enable discovery of hidden (a.k.a. blind) geothermal energy resources.

These databases showed that the water level of Issyk-Kul Lake varied along with changes in climate indicators. Fluctuations in the Issyk-Kul Lake surface level were generated by an unbalanced water budget (volume) as a result of meteorological and hydrological processes, such as precipitation, evaporation, infiltration, and inflow and outflow conditions of rivers that fall into this lake. The impacts of each of these factors on the lake's water balance are different, and the process usually has long temporal scales and effects. The quantitative measures of these factors and their actions are very important to considering the changes in water level of the lake surface. The data from the last 130 years indicated that the temperature in Issyk-Kul has changed over the years from 1880 to 2010. According to comprehensive analyses of these data, the water level has changed under the effects of global warming in this basin. The analysis of the weather station database over the last 130 years showed that approximately every 30 years there was an abrupt increase in air temperature during the hottest summer months that gradually decreased over that three decade cycle. These periods indicated an abrupt change in air temperature of 1-1.5 A degrees C by the end of each cycle. And any change in air temperature influenced the amount of river runoff, glacier melt, and lake volume in this region. Depending on the interaction between water volume and air temperature and a reduction in irrigation, the lake's water level also rose.						ji, li li/0000-0001-8483-1554													1866-7511	1866-7538				AUG	2015	8	8					5361	5371		10.1007/s12517-014-1516-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12517-014-1516-6													WOS:000360068200007
J	Li, JR; Lowenstein, TK; Blackburn, IR				Li, JR; Lowenstein, TK; Blackburn, IR			Responses of evaporite mineralogy to inflow water sources and climate during the past 100 ky in Death Valley, California	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												The mineralogy of cored sediments from Badwater Basin, Death Valley, California, provides information on water inflow sources and climate over the past 100 k.y. Abundant glauberite (Na2SO4 . CaSO4) and gypsum (CaSO4 . 2H(2)O), and relatively small amounts of calcite are associated with mudflat deposits from dry periods from 0 to 10 ka and 60 to 100 ka. In contrast, scarce CaSO4-bearing minerals but relatively abundant calcite are associated with halite and mud layers from 10 to 60 ka, including the 25 ka wet period when Death Valley contained a perennial lake (10 to 35 ka). Different mixing ratios of inflow waters between wet and dry periods are interpreted to be responsible for the relationship between mineral assemblages and climate. Modern Death Valley, representative of dry periods, is characterized by Na-Cl-SO4 brines, produced by mixing two basic types of inflow waters: (1) Na-HCO3-rich and Na-Cl-SO4-HCO3-rich meteoric waters from the Amargosa River, springs, and ground waters from northern and central Death Valley; and (2) Na-Ca-Cl-rich springs and ground waters from southern Death Valley, possibly related to volcanism, hydrothermal activity, and a 15-km-deep magma body. During dry periods, relatively abundant Ca-rich spring inflow removes HCO3 as calcite during the early stages of brine evolution. Further evaporative concentration produces gypsum and glauberite from the remaining Ca. During wetter periods, increased discharge of meteoric HCO3-rich Amargosa River water and basin-margin spring waters removes most Ca from the brine via precipitation of calcite, and, with low calcium concentrations, CaSO4-minerals are not abundantly formed during further evaporative concentration. Such Ca-poor, Na-Cl-SO4-rich brines precipitate thenardite (Na2SO4) during later stages of brine evolution.																			0016-7606					OCT	1997	109	10					1361	1371		10.1130/0016-7606(1997)109<1361:ROEMTI>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0016-7606(1997)109<1361:ROEMTI>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1997YD00700010

Coastal lake sediments from Arctic Svalbard suggest colder summers are stormier	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												The Arctic is rapidly losing its sea ice cover while the region warms faster than anywhere else on Earth. As larger areas become ice-free for longer, winds strengthen and interact more with open waters. Ensuing higher waves also increase coastal erosion and flooding, threatening communities and releasing permafrost carbon. However, the future trajectory of these changes remains poorly understood as instrumental observations and geological archives remain rare and short. Here, we address this critical knowledge gap by presenting a continuous Holocene-length reconstruction of Arctic eolian activity using coastal lake sediments from Svalbard. Exposed to both polar Easterlies and Westerly storm tracks, sheltered by a bedrock barrier, and subjected to little post-glacial uplift, our study site provides a stable baseline to assess Holocene changes in the dominant wind systems of the Barents Sea region. To do so with high precision, we rely on multiple independent lines of proxy evidence for wind-blown sediment input. Our reconstructions reveal quasi-cyclic summer wind maxima during regional cold periods, and challenge the view that a warmer and less icy future Arctic will be stormier. Coastal lake sediments from Svalbard are analyzed to reconstruct Holocene changes in Easterly and Westerly wind strength. These results show winds were stronger during cold summers and challenge the view that a warmer future Arctic will be stormier.					; Strzelecki, Mateusz/Y-9851-2019	van der Bilt, Willem/0000-0003-3157-451X; Strzelecki, Mateusz C/0000-0003-0479-3565; Stachowska, Zofia/0000-0001-7124-9231; 														2041-1723				NOV 11	2024	15	1							9688	10.1038/s41467-024-53875-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-53875-1								39528446					WOS:001357982900013

Endogenous regulation of the growth-rate responses of a spring-dwelling strain of the freshwater alga, Chlorella minutissima, to light and temperature	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PROTISTOLOGY												The paper presents a laboratory investigation of the temperature- and light- dependence of autotrophic growth of the alga Chlorella minutissima. It was isolated from the storage basin of a spring in the mountains of the Massif Central, France. The alga was grown at temperatures between (10 and 35 degrees C) and under irradiances from 30 to 550 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), under a light/dark cycle. The results were fitted to selected descriptive models, seeking to express, as far as possible, the observed physiological behaviour of the strain and the minimum irradiance required to sustain net growth. At all temperatures, the maximum rates of growth observed are strikingly slower than those of other Chlorella strains and of other small algae, reported in the literature, even when correction is made for continuous light. The Q(10) statistic for growth at temperatures >20 degrees C rates is also noticeably lower than in other species, while the apparent threshold of any growth is about 8 degrees C. Growth rates are readily light-saturated at all temperatures but with little evidence of adaptation of photosynthesis to low photon-flux rates. No short-term flexibility in these properties (over a time-scale of days) was demonstrated during the course of our experiments. We deduce that the algal strain had become genetically adapted to the relatively constant, even-temperature and low-light conditions of the spring-water habitat whence it was originally isolated.

J	Casanova, MT; Brock, MA				Casanova, MT; Brock, MA			How do depth, duration and frequency of flooding influence the establishment of wetland plant communities?	PLANT ECOLOGY												In many temporary wetlands such as those on the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales Australia, the development of plant communities is largely the result of germination and establishment from a long-lived, dormant seed bank, and vegetative propagules that survive drought. In these wetlands the pattern of plant zonation can differ from year to year and season to season, and depth is not always a good indicator of the plant community composition in different zones. In order to determine which aspects of water regime (depth, duration or frequency of flooding) were important in the development of plant communities an experiment using seed bank material from two wetlands was undertaken over a 16 week period in late spring-early summer 1995-1996. Seed bank samples were exposed to 17 different water-level treatments with different depths, durations and frequencies of flooding. Species richness and biomass of the communities that established from the seed bank were assessed at the end of the experiment and the data were examined to determine which aspects of water regime were important in the development of the different communities. It was found that depth, duration and frequency of inundation influenced plant community composition, but depth was least important, and also that the duration of individual flooding events was important in segregating the plant communities. Species were grouped according to their ability to tolerate or respond to fluctuations in flooding and drying. The highest biomass and species richness developed in pots that were never flooded. Least biomass and species richness developed in pots that were continuously flooded. Short frequent floods promoted high species richness and biomass especially of Amphibious fluctuation-tolerator species and Amphibious fluctuation-responder species that have heterophylly. Terrestrial species were able to establish during dry phases between short floods. Depth was important in determining whether Amphibious fluctuation-tolerator or Amphibious fluctuation-responder species had greater biomass. Longer durations of flooding lowered species richness and the biomass of terrestrial species. Experiments of this kind can assist in predicting vegetation response to water-level variation in natural and modified wetlands.																			1385-0237	1573-5052				APR	2000	147	2					237	250		10.1023/A:1009875226637	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1009875226637													WOS:000086380600009

Modern machine learning methods for feature selection can potentially be explored for identifying statistically significant features from pool of potential predictors of precipitation. In this work, we consider sparse regression, which simultaneously performs feature selection and regression, followed by random permutation tests for selecting dominant factors. We consider average winter precipitation over Great Lakes Region in order to identify its dominant influencing factors. Experiments show that global climate indices, computed at different temporal lags, offer predictive information for winter precipitation. Further, among the dominant factors identified using randomized permutation tests, multiple climate indices indicate the influence of geopotential height patterns on winter precipitation. Using composite analysis, we illustrate that certain patterns are indeed typical in high and low precipitation years, and offer plausible scientific reasons for variations in precipitation. Thus, feature selection methods can be useful in identifying influential climate processes and variables, and thereby provide useful hypotheses over physical mechanisms affecting local precipitation.

A total of 75 species of phytoplankton were identified: Bacillariophyceae (diatoms) contributed with the highest number of taxa (39) followed by Chlorophyceae (23). Cyanophyceae (9). and Dinophyceae (4). Diatoms constituted 52% of the total phytoplankton flora of the reservoir and the most common species were Synedra ulna. Cymbella affinis, and Cyclotella meneghiniana with pennate and centric diatoms being the dominant species in May and October-November, respectively. Although Chlorophytes occurred most of the year, they contributed with less species to the total flora. During the summer, their occurrence was considerably reduced with dominant species of Pediastrum. Scenedesmus, and Cosmarium. Cyanophyceae dominated the phytoplankton population in summer and maintained high biomass. Dinophyceae was by far the most important group with Peridinium sp. as the most significant species thriving in the reservoir. Peridinium sp., Peridinium cinctum, with Ceratium hirundinella. and Gymnodinium sp. appeared occasionally in low numbers.

J	Hong, HX; Sun, JQ; Wang, HJ				Hong, Haixu; Sun, Jianqi; Wang, Huijun			Interannual Variations in Summer Extreme Precipitation Frequency over Northern Asia and Related Atmospheric Circulation Patterns	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												This study investigates the spatial-temporal variations in summer extreme precipitation event (EPE) frequency over northern Asia and related atmospheric circulations. The division analysis indicates that three subregions of western Siberia (WS), eastern Siberia (ES), and eastern Mongolia-northeastern China can be identified, and the EPE variations over WS and ES are focused on here. On an interannual time scale, higher EPE frequencies are related to a similar dipole pattern in the upper troposphere [anomalous cyclone (anticyclone) to the west (southeast) of these two subregions] and a local anomalous cyclone in the lower troposphere. The dipole pattern leads to anomalous air divergence in the upper troposphere and compensating ascending motion over the subregions; the local anomalous cyclone in the lower troposphere leads to water vapor convergence. These anomalous atmospheric circulations therefore provide favorable dynamic and moisture conditions for higher EPE frequencies. Further analysis indicates that the WS EPE frequency is influenced by the combination of polar-Eurasian (POL) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) patterns, while the ES EPE frequency is influenced by Scandinavian (SCAND) [British-Baikal Corridor (BBC)] pattern over 1987-2004 (2005-15). The alternate influence on the ES EPE frequency may result from the interdecadal change in the structure of SCAND and BBC patterns. In addition, the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) shows enhanced influence on ES EPE frequency after the late 1990s, which could be due to interdecadal strengthening and extending of the anomalous cyclone around Lake Baikal. This cyclone is concurrent with EASM, and its changes favor water vapor transported by EASM to ES after the late 1990s.																			1525-755X	1525-7541				APR	2022	23	4					619	636		10.1175/JHM-D-21-0177.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-21-0177.1													WOS:000798104200007

This paper looks at the most important activities from a tourism perspective and considers the likelihood of impacts by climate change based on an extended literature review. It also examines current trends in tourism demand and concludes with both general and activity-specific adaptation and mitigation measures. The data collection and review process covered the relevant peer reviewed and grey literature. This comprehensive process was based on, and was open to, contributions by the full scientific community of relevant Austrian researchers and experts. The compilation process of the report followed quality standards such as the involvement of international partners as review editors within the review process. For many activities, climate change will lead to a prolongation of the season, which is an advantage for destinations focusing on hiking, biking, swimming, water sports, air sports and golf. However, it can be shown that climate-induced phenomena will have a strong impact on many of these activities, such as climbing and alpine touring, fishing, golf, and water and air sports. Here, the impacts may even lead to a change of destination or activity. Adaptation opportunities are rather limited in these cases. For other activities, adaptation measures can be applied to maintain the existing tourism offer. Irrigation can be increased in the case of golf courses, the construction of pools is feasible to compensate for deteriorated lakes, and destroyed trails and other hiking infrastructure, such as alpine hazard protection, could be reconstructed. However, all these measures are cost-intensive and may have a negative influence on the overall holiday experience. An early warning system via media (based on heat, thunderstorms and heavy rain) would be important to enable adaptation measures for companies and guests. Management implications: The discussion over different adaptation strategies is of great importance for tourism management. The paper presents four major strategies: center dot Adaptation of the natural conditions: In this case, vulnerability can be reduced by improving the natural conditions, e.g. saving water by redesigning golf courses to improve fish habitats. center dot Technical adaptation of the infrastructure: Technical solutions such as irrigation, artificial pools, artificial canoe routes or the reconstruction of trails maintain the important tourism functions. center dot Technical adaptation of the equipment: the goal is an improvement of the equipment in order to continue the activity (e.g. type of boat, type of hang glider). center dot Awareness raising, information and early warning systems: For many activities, an early warning system would be helpful to avoid risky situations due to flooding, rockfall, thunder storms or extreme heat.					; Borgwardt, Florian/AAS-5216-2020	Borgwardt, Florian/0000-0002-8974-7834; 													2213-0780	2213-0799				JUN	2021	34								100344	10.1016/j.jort.2020.100344	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jort.2020.100344		SEP 2021											WOS:000697164700005

Using modern through mid-Pleistocene climate proxy data to bound future variations in infiltration at Yucca Mountain, Nevada	GEOLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY OF YUCCA MOUNTAIN AND VICINITY, SOUTHERN NEVADA AND CALIFORNIA	Geological Society of America Memoir											Planetary and synoptic-scale atmospheric features are important because they set the stage for differing climate regimes in the Yucca Mountain area-whether in past, present, or future time. Climate proxy records in the region show that numerous climate regimes occurred during the past 800 k.y. ranging from warm interglacial periods ( similar to modern climate) to cool or cold and wet glacial periods. The current climate at Yucca Mountain is arid, with an annual average precipitation of similar to 17.7 cm/yr. Most of the annual precipitation occurs during winter or during July and August monsoons. Annual average temperatures generally range from 15 to 18 degrees C but can exceed 40 degrees C during summer. Continuously deposited calcite at Devils Hole, Nevada, provides a precise chronology that can be used to calibrate other climate proxy data that provide estimates of the nature and magnitude of past climate events. During past glacial periods, mean annual temperature may have been as much as 10 to 15 degrees C cooler than present temperatures, with mean annual precipitation as much as 1.4-3 times present precipitation. These records of past climate are used to bound estimates of future climate to assess future potential infiltration. Five maximum infiltration scenarios are estimated to occur within the next 500 k.y. providing that anthropogenic disturbance does not modify or alter long-term climate change.																			0072-1069		978-0-8137-1199-7				2007	199						155	205		10.1130/2007.1199(05)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2007.1199(05)													WOS:000271357900006

Detection of salmonellae in different turtle species within a headwater spring ecosystem	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES												Sediments and water from the slough arm of Spring Lake, the headwaters of the San Marcos River, Texas, USA, as well as swabs from biofilms on carapaces and from the cloacae of 18 common musk turtles (Sternotherus odoratus), 21 red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans), nine Texas river cooters (Pseudemys texana), one snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina serpentina), and three Guadalupe spiny soft-shell turtles (Apalone spinifera guadalupensis), caught at the same site, were analyzed for salmonellae by culture and molecular techniques. Although enrichment cultures from sediment and water samples were negative for salmonellae in polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based analyses, this technique detected salmonellae in the enrichments from both carapaces and cloacae of 11 musk turtles (61%), eight red-eared sliders (38%), and the snapping turtle. Salmonellae could also be detected in the enrichments from the carapaces of two additional red-eared sliders and two Texas river cooters; the remaining samples were negative. Further characterization of isolates obtained from the enrichment cultures of seven selected individuals that represented all turtle species with salmonellae confirmed the presence of Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica, with serovars Rubislaw, Newport, Gaminara, and Thompson identified. These results demonstrate the presence of different strains of potentially human pathogenic salmonellae naturally occurring on several turtle species with different life histories even within supposedly pristine environments.																			0090-3558	1943-3700				APR	2008	44	2					519	526		10.7589/0090-3558-44.2.519	http://dx.doi.org/10.7589/0090-3558-44.2.519								18436690					WOS:000255542600036

Use of PCR based technologies for risk assessment of a winter cyanobacterial bloom in Lake Midmar, South Africa	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY												Toxic freshwater cyanobacterial blooms are potential health hazards in water supply reservoirs and therefore predicting bloom events is an important goal of monitoring fresh water programmes. The recent identification of the mcy genes in the production of microcystin synthetase for the first time provides an avenue to study microcystin production at a genetic level. This paper reports analysis of a winter cyanobacterial bloom by use of quantitative real-time PCR, ELISA and PP2A methods for detection of strains present and determination of their toxigenicity in Lake Midmar South Africa. We further investigated the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton at different sampling sites and the physical and chemical changes caused in the surface water of Lake Midmar by waterfowl. Our study clearly demonstrates that the interaction between low surface water temperatures and productivity was overshadowed by the response to nutrients and nutrient availability. We also confirmed the presence of the toxic cyanobacterial strains through the use of molecular markers that detect the presence of some of the mcy genes in the mcy gene cluster that is able to synthesize microcystin toxins in Microcystis spp.					; Botha-Oberholster, Anna-Maria/B-1215-2008	Botha, Anna-Maria/0000-0002-9868-1566; 													1684-5315					AUG 6	2007	6	15					1794	1805																WOS:000248685500013

A high-resolution (decadal) multi-proxy approach, using geochemical, micropaleontological, and sedimentological methods was applied. Fifteen AMS-C-14 ages were used to establish the chronology, assuming a reservoir effect of 1,420 years. Our results point to a first strong monsoonal pulse at Lake Nam Co similar to 11.3 cal ka BP, followed by colder and drier conditions until similar to 10.8 cal ka BP. A warm and humid climate from similar to 10.8 to similar to 9.5 cal ka BP is related to a strong summer monsoon on the central TP, triggering a lake-level highstand at similar to 9.5 cal ka BP. Declining minerogenic input after similar to 9.5 cal ka BP indicates less moisture availability until similar to 7.7 cal ka BP. Following stable conditions between similar to 7.7 and similar to 6.6 cal ka BP, a warm and wet climate is inferred for the time span from similar to 6.6 to similar to 4.8 cal ka BP. A change towards drier conditions after similar to 4.8 cal ka BP points to a weakening of the Indian Ocean Summer Monsoon on the central TP, further diminished after similar to 2.0 cal ka BP. A short-term wet spell occurred from similar to 1.5 to similar to 1.3 cal ka BP. By comparing the results derived from Lake Nam Co with several lacustrine records from the central, northern, and eastern TP, a similar but not synchronous pattern of monsoon-driven paleoenvironmental change is observed. Although the general trend of lake and catchment evolution on the TP during the Holocene is also reproduced in this record, pronounced spatial and temporal offsets with respect to distinct climate events were detected, suggesting periods of non-uniform moisture and temperature evolution.

Of the total O2 consumption, 75-85% occurred in the epilimnia. Epilimetic O2 consumption per m3 and per m2 in Lake Johnson were higher than in Lake Hayes, reflecting known differences in the trophic status of the lakes, but estimates for the hypolimnia of the 2 lakes were similar. Daily hypolimnetic areal deficits were sensitive to both the depths and time intervals chosen. In the epilimnia, monthly O2 production by photosynthesis averaged 1.1 and 1.8 times the initial O2 content in Lakes Hayes and Johnson, respectively. Diffusion appeared to be of similar magnitude to photosynthesis in the isothermal period, but was less important during stratification. Losses to the hypolimnia by eddy diffusion were less than 10% of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis in the hypolimnia contributed 30-40% of the O2 consumed there and eddy diffusion supplied a further 20%. In Lake Johnson, a 3-5 m stratum of water in the metalimnion became anoxic for 2-3 mo. each summer while there were still up to 5.2 g/m3 of O2 remaining in the hypolimnion. Metalimnetic anoxia is largely due to O2 consumption in situ, resulting from the highly eutrophic state of the lake and intense thermal stratification. Zooplankton respiration accounted for less than 10% of the maximum net decline in metalimnetic O2 in 1970-71, but was more important in the other 2 yr. Changes in the O2 content of the hypolimnion indicate that Lake Hayes has become more eutrophic since 1954-55. In Lake Johnson, low O2 concentrations at the autumn overturn (< 5 g/m3) represent a threat to the trout population.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1979	13	3					427	441		10.1080/00288330.1979.9515820	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1979.9515820													WOS:A1979HV21700012

Meteorological influence on summertime baroclinic exchange in the Straits of Mackinac	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Straits flows can impose a complex hydrodynamic environment with high seasonal variability and significant impacts to nearby water bodies. In the Straits of Mackinac, exchange flow between Lake Michigan and Lake Huron influences water quality and ecological processes, as well as the transport of any contaminants released in or near the straits. Although previous work has shown that a Helmholtz mode is responsible for the barotropic flow oscillations in the straits, baroclinic effects impose opposite surface and subsurface flows during the summer months. In this study, we use observations of currents and water temperatures from instruments deployed in the straits to validate a hydrodynamic model of the combined Lake Michigan-Huron system and then use the model results to investigate the baroclinic flow and determine the forcing mechanisms that drive exchange flow in the Straits of Mackinac. Analysis shows that although the Helmholtz mode drives a 3 day oscillation throughout the year, thermal stratification in the summer establishes a bidirectional flow that is governed by a shift from regional-scale to local-scale meteorological conditions. These results detail the seasonal variability in the straits, including the barotropic and baroclinic contributions to exchange flow and the influence of local atmospheric forcing on transport through the Straits of Mackinac.

A one year monthly sampling was made between August 1993 and July 1994. Samples were obtained at one station along the entire water column (60 m) with a Van Dorn sampler and filtered through a 55 mu m mesh. Copepod densities were evaluated. Vertical profiles of temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, specific conductivity (K-25), and chlorophyll a concentrations were measured. Lake Alchichica limnetic area is hyposaline (K-25=13000 mu S cm-1.8.5 g l(-1)), basic (pH 8.6-9.2) and oligo-mesotrophic (0-17.7 mg m(-3) of chlorophyll a concentration). The lake is warm monomictic and circulates during the cold season (winter-spring). L, novamexicanus was the only crustacean zooplankton species inhabiting the limnetic area of the lake. Copepod densities ranged between 0 and 267 org l(-1) . A significative difference in copepod densities was observed between circulation (66.91+/-75.62 copepods l(-1), mean +/- 1 s.d.) and stratification (15.83+/-32.43 cope pods l(-1)) period, and between the upper (0-30 m, 44.54+/-64.64 copepods l(-1)) and lower strata (40-60 m, 19.77+/-43.88 copepods l(-1)) of the lake. Maximum copepod densities coincided with the presence of two phytoplankton blooms: a diatom bloom in January (chlorophyll a 4.1-8.5 mg m(-3)), and after wards, a cyanobacterial bloom (chlorophyll a 1.4-17.7 mg m(-3)), in May. Highest values of copepod densities were found between 10-15 m depth, within the photic zone (20-25 m) of the lake. L. novamexicanus population of Lake Alchichica limnetic zone might live under low interspecific competition conditions due to the absence of other crustacean zooplanktic species. Under these circumstances vertical and temporal fluctuations of this copepod population mainly depends on environmental conditions, basically on the periods of circulation-stratification of the lake that influence food availability.					; G., Mary/AAF-9622-2021; Alcocer, Javier/S-7672-2019	Alcocer, Javier/0000-0002-0535-7936; 													0034-7744	2215-2075				MAR	1999	47			1			141	148																WOS:000083207200018

The growth and the composition of the diet resemble those in other, less acid lakes in the same area. The reproduction of the perch failed in the springs of 1980-1982 as a result of high mortality of roe caused by low pH. The fertilization of most eggs may have been inhibited by decreased activity of the sperm cells, but even fertilized eggs showed high mortality. In spring 1981, many adult fish died, probably due to the low pH and high Al concentration of the water.																			0003-455X	1797-2450					1984	21	1					15	22																WOS:A1984SZ14200003

MIGRATION MONITORING INDICATES WIDESPREAD DECLINES OF AMERICAN KESTRELS (FALCO SPARVERIUS) IN NORTH AMERICA	JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH												We analyzed migration counts of American Kestrels (Falco sparverius) at. 20 autumn migration hawkwatch sites throughout North America to estimate population trends. Prior to trend analysis, we converted counts to indexes adjusted for effort and patterns of passage. In eastern North America, autumn counts showed a pattern of significant declines along the Atlantic Coast and eastern Appalachian Mountains, stable numbers in the eastern Great, Lakes region, and a significant increase in the western Great. Lakes region from 1974 to 2004. From 1994 to 2004, significant declines occurred at most hawkwatch sites in eastern North America, with nonsignificant. declines recorded in the western Great Lakes, northeastern Quebec, and Florida. In western North America, three counts from the Intermountain and Rocky Mountain regions that spanned the mid-1980s to 2005 showed mixed long-term trends. From 1995 to 2005, counts decreased significantly at three and nonsignificantly at two of six western hawkwatch sites active throughout the period. These results; suggest population declines across much of interior western North America and the Pacific Northwest; however, kestrel counts remained comparatively stable since the mid-1980s ill the southern Rocky Mountains. Migration counts along the Gulf of Mexico were variable from 1995 to 2005, with no strong indication of population changes in this region. The overall patient of migration counts, suggests that, kestrel populations have undergone a long-term decline in northeastern North America and more recent declines in the midwestern and western regions of the continent.

Diatoms were analyzed from a radiocarbon-dated core taken from Montezuma Well, a near thermally constant spring in north-central Arizona. Fluctuations in total diatom density, oscillations in the relative abundance of Anomoeoneis sphaerophora, and intermittent deposition of calcite suggest that water levels in Montezuma Well underwent dramatic fluctuations to the degree of being intermittently dry, or at least very shallow, during the middle Holocene (approximately 8000-5000 yr B.P.). The fluctuations in water level probably correspond to oscillations in regional temperature and precipitation, which regulate hydrologic input and evaporation rates. The dramatic fluctuations in water level during the middle Holocene suggest that the endemic biota of Montezuma Well underwent relatively rapid speciation within the past approximately 5000 yr. The appearance of endemic species (Gomphonema montezumense and Cyclotella pseudostelligera f. parva) at approximately 5000-3000 vr B.P. supports this hypothesis. Diatom indicators for organic enrichment (Aulacoseira granulata and A. islandica) closely coincide with the prehistoric native occupation of Montezuma Well.

Large- and small-scale movement and distribution of acoustically tagged lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) in eastern Lake Erie	ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY												Background Defining the spatial distribution, home range, and movement patterns of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) is important to managers and decision-makers given the large migration potential and potamodromous behavior exhibited by the species. A remnant population of lake sturgeon remains in the far eastern basin of Lake Erie and although recent efforts have estimated the population size, described the age distribution, and identified a primary spawning site no study to date has examined the spatial distribution or movements of individuals within this population. Between 2014 and 2018, we acoustically tagged 59 adult lake sturgeon, captured in the Buffalo Harbor area, and monitored their large-scale movements throughout Lake Erie with the Great Lakes Acoustic Telemetry System and small-scale movements with a Vemco Positioning System in the Buffalo Harbor area. After dividing Lake Erie into seven sections, we ran a multi-state mark-recapture model to examine the movement rates into and out of the eastern most section of the lake. Within a heavily utilized lake section, in the Buffalo Harbor area, we identified home ranges with our Vemco Positioning System for each season and year using averaged Brownian bridge movement models. Results Although some sturgeon demonstrated large-scale movements, traversing the entirety of Lake Erie, the majority of individuals spent their time in the eastern basin of the lake. Home ranges appeared to vary among seasons, but were consistent across years with lake sturgeon selecting the northeastern, rocky, and shallow area of our array during pre-spawning and spawning seasons and leaving our array, or selecting a trough running along the northwestern portion of our array comprising sand and bedrock, in the summer and fall seasons. Conclusions Documenting these large-scale movements aligns with previous findings that lake sturgeon on either end of the lake are genetically similar and demonstrates lake sturgeon in the eastern basin exhibit strong philopatry. Our small-scale movement models provide managers with spatial reference points, in the form of utilization distributions, indicating heavily used areas by lake sturgeon within seasons. Future studies should examine what parameters are driving site selection in these areas.

The diets of four Arctic charr morphs (Salvelinus alpinus (L.)); small benthic (SB), large benthic (LB), small limnetic (SL) and large limnetic (LL), were analysed on a seasonal and diel basis in different habitats in lake Thingvallavatn, Iceland. All morphs used the littoral habitat (littoral stony zone, 0-10 m depth, and littoral Nitella zone, 10-20 m depth), but limnetics also used the pelagic habitat (0-70 m depth). 2. The morphs exhibited dietary specializations, strongly correlated with distinct differences in trophic morphology. Benthic morphs foraged on zoobenthos, especially the mollusc Lymnaea peregra. Small limnetics fed extensively on open water foods, particularly zooplankton, whereas large limnetics preyed mainly upon threespined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, less on Arctic charr. Diet of limnetics differed slightly between habitats. 3. Seasonal and diel changes in diet composition were slight, and benthics and limnetics did not overlap in each others specific diet. However, all morphs converged in spring upon insect pupae that are then superabundant. The food segregation between benthics and limnetics was established from age 1 (fork length c. 7 cm) and onwards. 4. The size of snails eaten increased with increasing size of benthic charr, and the size of charr eaten increased with increasing size of LL charr. This is explained in terms of ontogenetic gape limitations. Larger snails eaten by SB charr relative to those eaten by similarly sized LB charr may be the result of the larger head and more subterminal mouth of SB charr, endowing them with greater ability to engulf larger snails. It is suggested that LL charr are ecomorphs of SL charr which, through ontogenetic shifts, switch from planktivory to piscivory at the size of 22 cm. 5. All morphs, except LL charr, showed peaks in stomach filling and fish caught in gill-nets around twilight in autumn. Depending on the morph, this may be linked with diel variation in availability of food organisms, and risk of predation by LL charr. 6. Strong correlations between ecology and morphology suggest that the benthic and limnetic morphs are adapted to the littoral benthic and pelagic niches respectively of Thingvallavatn. Low fish species diversity, discreteness, and stability of alternate niches in the lake may be important factors in reducing competitive interactions, and thus promoting coexistence by phenotype-specific preferences for resources.																			0021-8790	1365-2656					1992	61	1					21	35		10.2307/5505	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/5505													WOS:A1992HG62200003

In 2 experimentally fertilized lakes, chlorophyll concentrations in the hypolimnion exceeded 300 .mu.g/l while epilimnetic chlorophyll was only 3 .mu.g/l. The hypolimnetic bloom represented the major response to enhanced nutrient loading. The peak was in or below the thermocline at depths where 1-3% of photosynthetically available surface irradiance penetrated; the algae at the peak were growing flagellated colonial chrysophyceans. The autumn surface bloom was due to entrainment of this previously produced chlorophyll, not to growth caused by mixing in of hypolimnetic nutrients.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1976	21	6					767	783		10.4319/lo.1976.21.6.0767	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1976.21.6.0767													WOS:A1976CP58200001

They are predators as larvae and adults and thus essential for understanding aquatic food webs. This study was conducted in Plitvice lakes National Park (Croatia) representing a wide variety of freshwater habitats (springs, streams, lakes and tufa barriers). Adults were collected monthly from March 2007 until March 2009 using pyramid-type emergence traps at 13 locations. A total of 3865 specimens comprising 18 species were collected. The dominant genus was Chelifera, while the most abundant species was Hemerodromia unilineata. All species were univoltine except Chehfera precabunda, Chelifera pyrenaica and Chelifera stigmatica that were bivoltine. Considerable differences in composition and structure of aquatic dance flies assemblages were recorded along a longitudinal gradient of studied sites, primarily related to differences in physical and chemical parameters of water. Water temperature was the main factor influencing the timing of emergence. Hemerodromia species preferred variable water temperature throughout the year while the majority of the Chelifera species preferred stable water temperature characteristic of spring sites. Furthermore, discharge affected assemblage composition of aquatic dance flies. The highest abundance of aquatic dance flies was recorded in lotic habitats with fast water current over substrates of moss, gravel and particulate tufa with detritus. These results give a new insight on microhabitat preference and their distribution on unique karstic habitats. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

The effort and the yield stayed quite constant (averaging 5-10 kg/ha/lake) until the first half of the 1980's. During the last ten years the number of seine crews has almost doubled and harvest rates has increased up to 10-20 kg/ha/lake mainly as a consequence of technical development of gear, good marketing opportunities, state financial support and also renewal of the Finnish Fishery Act which now favour professional fishermen. Technical development of equipment and gear increased the profitability of seining by bath increasing yield per crew and lowering the number of fishermen per crew from 4-6 to 2-3. Average gross turnover income of winter seine crew at the end of 1980's was about 80000 Fmk. Vendace growth rate, body condition and recruitment indicated that density-dependent intra-specific processes dominate in the vendace population dynamics in the lakes studied Consequently, size (growth rate) of 0+ vendace in combination with winter seine catch per unit effort data and yield time-series should be included in a lake specific management model. In order to secure a profitable and sustainable fishery, a recommended strategy for vendace fisheries management would be a reduction of abundance to a population level optimizing growth rate, recruitment and economic yield (i.e., mean size of catchable fish) combined with a further development of marketing and processing of small-sized vendace. As a conclusion, when managing the fishery one must consider both the optimization of the harvesting from an ecological point of view and the economics ruling the exploitation of the stock.																			0071-1128		3-510-47047-8				1995	46						369	377																WOS:A1995BH14P00045
J	BOON, PI; MITCHELL, A				BOON, PI; MITCHELL, A			METHANOGENESIS IN THE SEDIMENTS OF AN AUSTRALIAN FRESH-WATER WETLAND - COMPARISON WITH AEROBIC DECAY, AND FACTORS CONTROLLING METHANOGENESIS	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Sediment oxygen demands and water-atmosphere methane emissions of a highly productive, freshwater wetland on the floodplain of the River Murray in south-eastern Australia were quantified over a 14 month period in 1993-1994. Total sediment oxygen demands ranged from 1.3 to 3.3 mmol m(-2) h(-1), of which <3 to 90% was due to chemical oxygen demand. Methane emissions ranged from <0.01 mmol m(-2) h(-1) in winter to 2.75 mmol m(-2) h(-1) in summer. Methanogenesis accounted for at least 60% of the combined aerobic and methanogenic carbon flux in sediments from Eleocharis sphacelata beds, and at least 30% and 40% of the combined flux in sediments from Myriophyllum sp. beds and Vallisneria gigantea beds, respectively. In vitro incubations, using additions of sulfate and of molybdate, failed to indicate unequivocally competition for substrates between sulfate-reducing and methanogenic bacteria. However, in vitro methanogenesis was strongly inhibited by nitrate, suggesting an interaction between benthic methanogens and denitrifying or other nitrate-reducing bacteria. Fe3+ decreased in vitro methanogenesis by 16-49% during January, February and March 1994; oxidation of organic matter at the expense of the reduction of ferric ions could be a significant route for detritus processing in Eleocharis-bed sediments in the warmer months. Methanogenesis was increased consistently by additions of some low molecular weight substrates, such as acetate, but not by others, such as methanol, propionate and trimethylamine. Complex polymeric substrates, such as cellulose, starch and aquatic plant matter, increased in vitro methanogenesis rapidly and markedly. Despite this, no relationship between methane emissions and benthic cellulase activity was observed in the field. Methanogenesis was strongly temperature dependent, being maximal at 30 to 40 degrees C and minimal at 5 degrees C, thereby explaining the strong seasonality observed in methane emissions in situ.																			0168-6496					NOV	1995	18	3					175	190		10.1016/0168-6496(95)00053-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0168-6496(95)00053-5													WOS:A1995TH36400002

Abundance, Biomass, and Production of Heterotrophic Bacteria in a Large Plain Reservoir during the Ice-Covered Period	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												The abundance, biomass, production, and size and morphological structure of heterotrophic bacteria have been determined and their contribution to the total plankton biomass has been assessed in the Rybinsk Reservoir (the Upper Volga) during the ice-covered period. Structural and functional characteristics of bacteria, except for their cell sizes in winter, are lower than those in the growing season. However, heterotrophic bacteria have made the main contribution (89.3%) to the total biomass of plankton community in winter. During the growing season, phytoplankton is a major component of plankton (48.8%), while the bacteria average 36.5%. The total plankton biomass under the ice averages 148 mg C/m(3), which is 2.6 times lower than in the period of open water. During the ice-covered period, the number of protists is small and they consume an insignificant part of the bacterial production; viral lysis is the main reason for bacterial mortality.

A new element in the migration cycle of the European river lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis: downstream migration from a lake	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												In 2019, during spring flood, we collected unusual Lampetra fluviatilis smolts migrating from a small lake, as part of a multi-year survey in the Chernaya River (Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea). They differed from the ordinary Lampetra fluviatilis individuals in some of the features, mainly size. The emigration occurred at the darkest period of night and during extreme flooding, which significantly worsened the conditions in the Lake Gladyshevskoe and Chernaya River. In these individuals, lacus smolts, emigration occurred in the spring season with the migration of ordinary flumen specimens. Several hypotheses are discussed to explain the observation of large lacus (148-165 mm) individuals: they are seaward migrants, within expected body sizes of European river lamprey species but unusual for Gulf of Finland tributaries; the lake is a transitional habitat, and the postmetamorphic lacus juveniles migrating through it from a tributary; postmetamorphic lacus juveniles spend some time feeding in a lake but emigrated due to environmental conditions; larvae of European river lamprey, developing in the eutrophic lake, reach greater sizes than riverine larvae before transformation and subsequently produce larger juveniles.

Oxygen isotope fractionation between gypsum and its formation waters: Implications for past chemistry of the Kawah Ijen volcanic lake, Indonesia	AMERICAN MINERALOGIST												Gypsum (CaSO4 center dot 2H(2)O) provides an opportunity to obtain information from both the oxygen isotopic composition of the water and sulfate of its formation waters, where these components are commonly sourced from different reservoirs (e.g., meteoric vs. magmatic). Here, we present delta O-18 values for gypsum and parent spring waters fed by the Kawah Ijen crater lake in East Java, Indonesia, and from these natural samples derive gypsum-fluid oxygen isotope fractionation factors for water and sulfate group ions of 1.0027 +/- 0.0003 parts per thousand and 0.999 +/- 0.001 parts per thousand, respectively. Applying these fractionation factors to a growth-zoned gypsum stalactite that records formation waters from 1980 to 2008 during a period of passive degassing, and gypsum cement extracted from the 1817 eruption tephra fall deposit, shows that these fluids were in water-sulfate oxygen isotopic equilibrium. However, the 1817 fluid was >5 parts per thousand lighter. This indicates that the 1817 pre-emption lake was markedly different, and had either persisted for a much shorter duration or was more directly connected to the underlying magmatic-hydrothermal system. This exploratory study highlights the potential of gypsum to provide a historical record of both the delta O-18(water) and delta O-18(sulfate) of its parental waters, and provides insights into the processes acting on volcanic crater lakes or any other environment that precipitates gypsum.					; Utami, Sri/IST-5022-2023	Utami, Sri Budhi/0000-0003-4338-0157; 													0003-004X	1945-3027				MAY	2020	105	5					756	763		10.2138/am-2020-7298	http://dx.doi.org/10.2138/am-2020-7298													WOS:000530656700015

Therefore, it is critical to understand sediment response characteristics under the context of increasing C concentrations in lake water. Based on the changes of sediment C concentration at different depths in Poyang Lake, belonging to China's large floodplain-lake system, we revealed the sediment C short-term response characteristics to changes in lake water C concentrations as well as their associated impacting factors. We found that dissolved total carbon (DTC) concentrations increased by 25.78% in winter compared to spring, while total carbon (TC) sediment concentrations increased by only 4.37% during the corresponding period. Specifically, we found that there was a hysteresis effect in the response of sediment C to the increase of water C concentration in the short term. When DTC concentrations in water were below a threshold value (12.50 mg/L), sediment TC concentrations were generally maintained at approximately 5.79 mg/kg. We also believed that biological and environmental factors and sediment stratification characteristics collectively resulted in this sediment C hysteresis effect. Among these factors and characteristics, phytoplankton can affect sediment C response by changing C absorption and utilization in water or cause a synergistic effect along with environmental factors, which is the key link that causes this C sediment hysteresis effect to occur. Furthermore, we found that the combined effect of sediment C from different depths also resulted in a hysteresis effect in C deposition.

To restore habitats for biodiversity conservation and flood control, 459 dykes were demolished and 14 were preserved in 2017. However, the direct impact of dyke demolition on wintering waterbirds was not comprehensively assessed. In this study, based on annual waterbird census and habitat data (2013/14-2020/21), we compared the differences in habitat areas and species composition of waterbirds in the dyke-demolished and preserved areas, and explored whether habitat changes caused by the dyke demolition were responsible for the changes in the number of species and percentages of waterbird individuals. The results indicate that the areas of water (including shallow water) and mudflat habitats significantly decreased, but the vegetation area significantly increased in the dyke-demolished areas. The species numbers and percentages of waterbird individuals at the community and foraging guilds levels, and the percentages of nine species, were higher in the dyke-preserved areas than those in the dyke-demolished areas. Changes in the numbers of species and percentages of individuals of fish eaters, insectivores, and omnivores positively correlated with drastic changes in the percentages of water habitats (including shallow water) after dyke demolition. Effective measures should be carried out to restore hydrological regimes, providing waterbirds sufficient suitable habitats with different water depths. These findings improve our understanding of the influence of dyke demolition on waterbirds and provide insights for wetland management and waterbird conservation.					; LI, feng/HIR-1703-2022; Zhang, Siqi/GWZ-5619-2022	Chen, Xin-sheng/0009-0009-6601-8725; Zhang, Pingyang/0000-0001-9767-0550; , Xinsheng/0000-0002-3720-247X; Zou, Yeai/0000-0002-5655-8287													2045-7758					APR	2022	12	4							e8782	10.1002/ece3.8782	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.8782								35386878					WOS:000776210300001

Threshold sensitivity of shallow Arctic lakes and sublake permafrost to changing winter climate	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Interactions and feedbacks between abundant surface waters and permafrost fundamentally shape lowland Arctic landscapes. Sublake permafrost is maintained when the maximum ice thickness (MIT) exceeds lake depth and mean annual bed temperatures (MABTs) remain below freezing. However, declining MIT since the 1970s is likely causing talik development below shallow lakes. Here we show high-temperature sensitivity to winter ice growth at the water-sediment interface of shallow lakes based on year-round lake sensor data. Empirical model experiments suggest that shallow (1m depth) lakes have warmed substantially over the last 30years (2.4 degrees C), with MABT above freezing 5 of the last 7 years. This is incomparison to slower rates of warming in deeper (3 m) lakes (0.9 degrees C), with already well-developed taliks. Our findings indicate that permafrost below shallow lakes has already begun crossing a critical thawing threshold approximately 70 years prior to predicted terrestrial permafrost thaw in northern Alaska.					; Grosse, Guido/F-5018-2011	Jones, Benjamin/0000-0002-1517-4711; Parsekian, Andrew/0000-0001-5072-9818; Grosse, Guido/0000-0001-5895-2141													0094-8276	1944-8007				JUN 28	2016	43	12					6358	6365		10.1002/2016GL068506	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016GL068506													WOS:000380910100054

We used a space-for-time approach to elucidate such possible effects by comparing data from 1656 shallow lakes (mean depth <3 m) in north temperate Denmark (DK) and subtropical Florida (FL). The lakes were categorized into 7 total phosphorus (TP) classes within the range of 2 to 300 mu g L-1. Physicochemical variables showed significant seasonal differences, which can be attributed to different sunlight regimes and temperatures. The FL lakes had overall higher fish biomasses (notably in the littoral zone) but a substantially lower zooplankton biomass and body mass of microcrustaceans, a much lower zooplankton:phytoplankton biomass ratio (lower grazing on phytoplankton), and a markedly lower biomass of benthic invertebrates, indicating much greater control of consumers by fish in the FL lakes. Accordingly, the summer phytoplankton biomass was higher in the FL lakes. Cyanobacteria in summer were proportionally more important in the FL lakes at all TP levels, whereas the proportion of dinophytes, chrysophytes, and cryptophytes was higher in the DK lakes at low TP. Submerged macrophytes occurred at higher TP (>100 mu g L-1) in the FL lakes, but coverage was higher in the DK lakes at low TP. We also found lower oxygen saturation in the nutrient-rich FL lakes than in the DK lakes, suggesting lower net ecosystem production in the FL lakes. We discuss our results within the framework of climate warming.

In the majority of surface water samples (river, lake and seawater) nitrite is expected to play a more important role as (OH)-O-center dot source compared to nitrate, in spite of the usually lower [NO2-] values. Interestingly, under the hypothesis of a constant ratio of the concentrations of nitrate and nitrite (to be corrected later on for the actual concentration ratio in a given sample), the relative role of nitrite compared to nitrate Would be minimum in summer, at noon, in the surface layer of natural waters. Any decrease in the sunlight intensity that can be experienced in the natural environment (different season than summer, water column absorption, time of the day other than the solar noon), with its associated influence on the sunlight spectrum, would increase the relative role of nitrite compared to nitrate.					; maurino, valter/LGZ-4880-2024; Vione, Davide/A-4047-2008; Minero, Claudio/A-6444-2008	Maurino, Valter/0000-0001-8456-525X; Minero, Claudio/0000-0001-9484-130X													0003-4592					AUG	2007	97	8					699	711		10.1002/adic.200790054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adic.200790054								17899883					WOS:000249404500011

However, creating a comfortable microclimate in these parks is challenging, particularly in cities with scorching summers and significant diurnal temperature differences, such as Zhengzhou (characterised by hot and humid summers). Addressing this challenge is a critical objective in urban planning, as it directly affects the well-being and park usage of residents. From July 11 to 16,2023, Longzi Lake Park was taken as the research object, and the peak period of crowd activity from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. was selected for observing tourists behaviour. During this period, the microclimate factors, including air temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction, were continuously observed by measuring instruments at a height of 1.5 m from the ground. The research indicates several key findings: (1) Both solar radiation and air temperature significantly affect human thermal comfort in the park. As solar radiation intensifies, individuals experience the most comfortable thermal sensations in fully shaded areas. Hence, it can be noted that provision of shading is an important factor in reducing heat stress. (2) The presence of water bodies also significantly enhances thermal comfort during the summer months. Water features contribute to a cooling and humidifying effect, and improved thermal comfort levels in water-adjacent areas. Therefore, park visitors tend to seek out waterside spaces for activities and relief from the heat. (3) The study identifies a negative correlation between PET (Physiologically Equivalent Temperature) and the number of visitors with tendency to visit waterside areas. This suggests that the perception of thermal comfort is affected by the type of activity, with park visitors engaged in physical exercises appearing to be reduced.

Introduction, distribution, spread, and impacts of exotic freshwater gastropods in Texas	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We examined the patterns of distribution, vectors of introduction, and potential ecological impacts of freshwater exotic species in Texas over the last 45 years. Currently, five species of exotic gastropods are established: channeled-type applesnail (Pomacea insularum), red-rim melania (Melanoides tuberculatus), quilted melania (Tarebia granifera), giant rams-horn snail (Marisa cornuarietis), and Chinese mysterysnail (Cipangopaludina chinensis). In contrast to the northern part of the US, where shipping appears to be the most important vector for the introduction of aquatic invasive species, aquarium and ornamental trade dominated among unintentional vectors of introduction of all freshwater exotics in Texas, resulting in different patterns of distribution, spread, and ecological impacts. The rate of spread of exotic gastropods in Texas varied from 39 waterbodies colonized over 18 years for P. insularum to only three waterbodies during last 45 years for C. chinensis. Four of five exotic gastropods were found in highly vulnerable aquifer-fed springs and rivers, which contain numerous endemic and endangered species. The fifth species, Pomacea insularum, is an agricultural pest. Potential negative ecological effects of exotic gastropods include impacts on wetlands and wetland restoration, competitive exclusion of native snails, and the introduction of exotic parasites, trematodes, which could infect fish and waterfowl, including federally protected species. Aquifer springs with stable temperature regimes are refuges for both cold and warm intolerant species.					; Karatayev, Vadim/NHQ-2178-2025	Karatayev, Vadim/0000-0001-7112-8069; Burlakova, Lyubov/0000-0002-2995-919X; Padilla, Dianna/0000-0002-5530-9131; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2009	619						181	194		10.1007/s10750-008-9639-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9639-y													WOS:000261751000014

A total of 19 taxa of different taxonomic level of macrozoobenthos and zooplankton were reported for the first time in the studied lakes. The enriched list included 4 new planktonic species (of Rotifera type) and 15 new macrozoobenthic taxa (4 species of Oligochaeta, 2 species of Bivalvia, one genus of Ephemeroptera, one species of Plecoptera, 4 species, 1 genera and 2 families of the Trichoptera groups). Five fish species were registered belonging to two families in the composition of the ichthyofauna of the studied lakes. The similarities in the species composition of the macrozoobenthos and zooplankton among the lakes and in comparison with previous investigations were assessed. The statistically significant differences found for the macrozoobenthos composition in comparison with the published in 1975 revealed two completely different communities. Moreover, this applied also to the zooplankton community which fundamentally differed from that found in 1975. The large number of taxa reported for the first time was probably due to the long period of time since the last studies (more than 40 years) and the changes in the ecological conditions in the lakes. A more refined examination of the ecosystem functioning could provide more comprehensive data about the processes in these lakes of high conservation value.					; Kazakov, Stefan/JRW-1182-2023; Varadinova, Emilia/C-2114-2019; Vidinova, Yanka/K-2467-2019; Tyufekchieva, Violeta/HNI-2291-2023	Varadinova, Emilia/0000-0002-2382-9191; Tyufekchieva, Violeta/0000-0001-9324-0430; 													0324-0770					DEC	2012				4			187	195																WOS:000314137300028

Except for forfeiture, the payoff on the bonds should not depend on the firm's performance, nor should managers be permitted to hedge the risk of forfeiture. The threshold for forfeiture should be crossed well before a firm violates its regulatory capital requirements and well before its contingent convertible securities convert into equity. The Swiss Bank UBS has paid bonuses to its top 6,500 executives that have been structured in exactly this way. Management forfeits its deferred compensation if the bank's regulatory capital ratio falls below 7.5%, and its contingent convertible debt is set up to convert into equity if the bank's capital ratio falls below 5%.					kashyap, anil/KHU-4383-2024; Diamond, Douglas/KHZ-3251-2024	Diamond, Douglas/0000-0002-1625-502X													1078-1196	1745-6622				FAL	2013	25	4					37	+		10.1111/jacf.12040	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jacf.12040													WOS:000211604900006

Tree regeneration patterns in canopy gaps after a decade of Chusquea quila (Poaceae) dieback in an old-growth remnant forest in the lake district of south-central Chile	REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL												In old-growth forests at low elevations in south-central of Chile (38-42 degrees S), the native understory bamboo Chusquea quila plays all important role on the establishment and growth of tree species in tree-fall gaps. Bamboo dieback that occurs after an extensive vegetative period represents a large-scale endogenous disturbance that could influence tree regeneration dynamics in gaps. The main goal of this study was to analyze the main patterns of the tree regeneration in canopy gaps in an old-growth remnant forest, 10 years after the bamboo dieback in 1994. Six gaps tree-fall gaps were located and permanent plots were established to study the demography and growth changes of the advanced regeneration and new recruitments. These changes were evaluated between the years 1994 and 2003. The advanced regeneration was composed mainly of the shade-tolerant tree species A. punctatum, L. philippiana and A. luma. Their mortality after 10 years averaged 42 % and affected mostly individuals originated from seeds. In contrast, individuals of L. philippiana and E. cordifolia, originated from rootstocks, showed higher growth rates and lower mortality. On the other hand, new recruitment was characterized by the abundant regeneration of N. obliqua, P. saligna and A. chilensis during the first season after the dieback; however few individuals of these species survived the competition of the new bamboo cohort. Similarly, Juveniles originated from rootstocks of E. cordifolia, G. avellana and L. philippiana showed higher growth rates and survivorship than plants originated from seeds. These results suggest that the temporary increase of resources in canopy gaps, due to the bamboo dieback, would favor tree species of mid-late successional stands, especially those originated from vegetative reproduction. Pioneer species in these forests such as N. obliqua were not favored by the bamboo dieback in small gaps (< 1,000 m(2)), suggesting these species that would depend mostly on large-scale catastrophic disturbances.					; González, Mauro/AAH-7569-2019	Gonzalez, Mauro/0000-0002-4333-724X; Munoz Navarro, Ariel/0000-0002-1719-4900; 													0716-078X	0717-6317				JUN	2009	82	2					185	198																WOS:000268550000002

Depletion of oxygen was nonlinear, and the most appropriate regression model used a log transformation indicating that depletion was exponential. A correlation between WODR and sediment organic content was found both within and between the two lakes studied. Spatial variation in WODR indicated that whole-lake WODR based on single-point vertical profiles may be highly inaccurate. Oxygen concentrations in the water column stabilized at low (0.5-2.0 mg .cntdot. L-1) levels although an anoxic water layer may occur over the sediment.

Understanding past hydroclimatic variations of the region is therefore important for predicting future changes under global warming scenarios. Here we present a continuous compound-specific hydrogen isotope record of sedimentary leaf waxes covering the past 18 ka (ka = 1000 yr) from Ngamring Co, located in the upper-middle Yarlung Tsangpo range, a typical monsoonal region, with the aim of documenting hydroclimatic changes since the last deglaciation. Compared with measurements of continuous scanning XRF and magnetic suscepti-bility, the delta D at Ngamring Co is believed to reflect atmospheric circulation and glacial meltwater input rather than direct local humidity. In detail, the record indicates relatively enriched delta D values during the Late Pleis-tocene, suggesting the predominance of the Westerlies and limited moisture delivery by the ISM, which was associated with cooling at high northern latitudes. The fast delta D depletion indicates that ISM penetrated into TP since similar to 10.5 ka BP (before present, the present is 1950 CE), then the gradually increased delta D values suggested the ISM attenuated in phase with summer insolation during early to middle Holocene. The negative deviation of 8D (> 8 parts per thousand, abrupt depleted at 3 ka BP) since-6 ka BP suggested glacier melting in the catchment and ended at-0.2 ka BP, which emphasizes the glacial contribution to the hydroclimatic change in Yarlung Tsangpo watershed. Such depletion was also observed at Aweng Co in the western TP, which suggests that a glacier meltwater contribution to lakes and rivers may be a large-scale phenomenon on the TP. Comparison of the delta D record from Ngamring Co with independent paleotemperature records indicates the control of summer tem-perature/insolation on glacier melting may not be the most important factor during the late Holocene, and instead we propose that the mean annual air temperature and glacier volume were more crucial to the melting process. If our inference is correct, the disappearance of a glacier from the Ngamring Co basin at similar to 0.2 ka BP is likely to be indicative of the fate of other glaciers on the TP under ongoing global warming. However, inde-pendent reconstructions of temperature and direct glacier dynamics from the same site are needed to validate our hypothesis.					hou, xiaohuan/HJB-1484-2022; Hou, Juzhi/W-5655-2018; Sun, Zhe/NOE-9186-2025														0031-0182	1872-616X				JUL 15	2022	598								111027	10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.111027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.111027		MAY 2022											WOS:000802968400004

However, the quality of these water bodies is currently deteriorating due to urbanization, industrialization, farming, and other anthropogenic activities. This study was conducted within January 25th to November 26th 2017at designated points at Pantai River, Anak Air Batu River, and Varsity Lake, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where the physic-chemical and biological characteristics were determined in order to increase the statistical basis of these regions. In the physic-chemical evaluation of the water samples, diverse parameters were measured, such as the pH, turbidity, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Suspended Solids (SS), ammonia, phosphate and nitrate attention, and biology. These parameters were compared with the Water Quality Index (WQI) standards of water quality. Overall, the result showed that the DO, BOD, COD, and SS fall within classes II, III, while Ammoniacal Nitrogen (NH3-N) falls within classes II, IV, and V, and pH and temperature fall within class I. The study area reported moderate levels of pollution between classes I and IIA due to urban activities. The results showed that the water collected from the study area was unsuitable for human consumption due to the significant presence of microbes.

Gang Benchhen, Paiku Gangri	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Quantifying the timing and extent of Quaternary mountain glaciations can help us in understanding the cause of ice-age cycles. As such, impressive achievements have been made in glacial dynamics across many mountain ranges around the world, such as the Himalayas. Yet, the Marine Isotope Stage 6 (MIS 6) glacial histories have not been well determined across the Himalayan regions due to a lack of adequate chronological controls. Here, we present a Be-10 surface-exposure chronology northwest of Mt. Gang Benchhen, Paiku Gangri. Twelve Be-10 exposure-ages show that the outermost hummocky moraine outside of the Laqu Valley was formed around similar to 165.7 ka, reflecting the MIS 6 glacial maximum in the central Himalaya. The minimum age constraint is consistent with the low atmospheric CO2 levels as well as low summer solar insolation intensity at northern high-latitude, which indicate that glaciers in the Laqu Valley culminated during cold climate condition. Also, we identified a potential correlation between the MIS 6 glacial advance in the central Himalaya and Heinrich-like event. We thus hypothesize that there seems to be a response of Himalayan glaciers to the combined forcing of the boreal summer solar insolation intensities, atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and North Atlantic climate oscillations during the MIS 6 glaciation.

Only 15 species have been delisted because of recovery in the history of the ESA. The Borax Lake chub (Gila boraxobius), an endangered species restricted to an Oregon spring system, is considered to be on the brink of recovery and may warrant future delisting. A panel of scientists was convened to determine consensus regarding the species' listing status by reviewing: (1) current habitat conditions, (2) implementation of the recovery plan, and (3) applicability of ESA listing factors. Despite substantial progress towards recovery, threats to the species remain, including habitat degradation and the potential introduction of nonnative species. These are problems common to many fishes of highly restricted distribution. Because the Borax Lake chub occurs in a single spring system, the species remains vulnerable to catastrophic loss and requires continuing protection afforded by the ESA. Like many spring-dwelling fishes with a restricted range, recovery of the Borax Lake chub to the point where ESA protection is no longer required is an admirable but largely unobtainable goal. Prevention of extinction rather than delisting is a more appropriate measure of ESA success for such species.

Suspended sediment was collected monthly during the 2018 water year for the main stem and two sub-basins using in-situ, passive samplers that integrated a range of streamflow conditions. Sediment fingerprinting used 44 indicators to apportion samples among five sources: cropland, pasture, forest, road dirt, and streambanks. Cropland, pasture, and streambanks had similar ranges in sediment-bound phosphorus (679-1670 ppm). Cropland contributed 21 +/- 15% (monthly mean +/- standard deviation; 0-46% among individual months) of suspended sediment during the year. Fall and spring peaks in cropland contribution highlight the ongoing importance of on-field management, but this small contribution of suspended sediment relative to the expanse of cropland may reflect implementation of best-management practices. Pasture contributed 0-66% (16 +/- 19%) of suspended sediment and roads 0-26% (6 +/- 6%). Streambanks contributed 12-100% (55 +/- 25%) and was the only source identified in all sediment samples. In this basin, most cropland-adjacent streambanks are protected by a riparian setback. However, streams traversing other land-use types are not as consistently protected, and these setbacks do not protect the stream channel from discharge of water from sump pumps, road culverts, or tile drains. The contribution of sediment from other land uses combined with that from the agricultural drainage network (as stream-bank material) underscores the need to consider water movement in the basin as a whole.

Evidence of spawning by lake trout Salvelinus namaycush on substrates at the base of large boulders in northern Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Identification of lake trout spawning sites has focused on cobble substrates associated with bathymetric relief (e.g., 'contour' or 'slope' along reefs), but this 'model' may be narrow in scope. Previous telemetry work conducted near Drummond Island, USA, Lake Huron, identified egg presence in substrates at the base of large boulders (>1 m diameter); however, the extent of this phenomenon was unknown. Telemetry data paired with multi-beam bathymetry identified a 0.63 km(2) area used by lake trout characterized by low bathymetric relief and numerous (similar to 269) large boulders (>1 m diameter) with small-diameter substrates at their bases. Diver surveys revealed egg presence at all 40 boulders surveyed, exclusively associated with clean gravel-cobble (0.6-42 cm) substrates in undercut areas beneath overhanging edges of boulders and in narrow spaces between adjacent boulders. Egg presence was not associated with boulder or substrate physical characteristics which highlighted the possible importance of interstitial currents. Successful incubation in these habitats was inferred by capture of free embryos and post-embryos the following spring using traps and an electrofishing ROV although at lower densities than at popular spawning habitats nearby (1-3 km away). Free embryos and post-embryos were also caught where eggs were not observed the previous fall including unexpectedly on top of boulders which suggested that post-hatch stages may move more than previously thought. Extensive use of boulder-associated habitats for spawning, egg incubation, and early growth suggested this undescribed habitat type may provide an unanticipated contribution to total available lake trout spawning habitat and recruitment in the Great Lakes.

This study aims to evaluate the potential of deep learning, one of the fastest-growing trends in machine learning, to detect plant invasion in urban parks using high-resolution (0.1 m) aerial image time series. Capitalizing on a state-of-the-art, popular architecture residual neural network (ResNet), we examined key challenges applying deep learning to detect plant invasion: relatively limited training sample size (invasion often confirmed in the field) and high forest contextual variation in space (from one invaded park to another) and over time (caused by varying stages of invasion and the difference in illumination condition). To do so, our evaluations focused on a widespread exotic plant, autumn olive (Elaeagnus umbellate), that has invaded 20 urban parks across Mecklenburg County (1410 km(2)) in North Carolina, USA. The results demonstrate a promising spatial and temporal generalization capacity of deep learning to detect urban invasive plants. In particular, the performance of ResNet was consistently over 96.2% using training samples from 8 (out of 20) or more parks. The model trained by samples from only four parks still achieved an accuracy of 77.4%. ResNet was further found tolerant of high contextual variation caused by autumn olive's progressive invasion and the difference in illumination condition over the years. Our findings shed light on prioritized mitigation actions for effectively managing urban invasive plants.					; Chen, Gang/AAG-9414-2020	Chen, Gang/0000-0002-7469-3650; 														2072-4292				NOV	2020	12	21							3493	10.3390/rs12213493	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12213493													WOS:000589267900001

PREPARING FOR PLANNED EVENTS: NATIONAL SECURITY SPECIAL EVENTS	ROLE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AND HOMELAND SECURITY	Community Environment and Disaster Risk Management											Successful National Security Special Events (NSSE) have several critical components that will ensure success; one key component is collaboration among various and distinctive organizations. During the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah, 11,000 public safety officers came together from federal, state, and local agencies and successfully protected the games. In subsequent years following the 9/11 terror attacks and the Olympic Games, however, law enforcement and public safety agencies at every level have, at times, struggled to successfully implement collaborations on a continuing and consistent basis. Creating collaborations that endure throughout a national security event is an important issue for public safety organizations. What are the key factors that foster an environment in which collaborations can be sustained? Based on research and numerous interviews with law enforcement and public safety leaders involved in the 2002 Winter Olympics, several factors were identified that impact the effectiveness and endurance of collaborations. The enablers for effective collaborations before, during, and after the 2002 Winter Olympics included leadership, trust, social capital, and felt need.																			2040-7262		978-1-78769-335-7; 978-1-78769-336-4				2021	24						193	201		10.1108/S2040-726220210000024010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/S2040-726220210000024010													WOS:000850270500011

While Daphnia numerical densities were not significantly different between groups of lakes, pulicaria lakes had much higher Daphnia biomasses and filtration potentials than galeata lakes. Although we found significant differences in chlorophyll (Chl) a between both groups of lakes during June, on a seasonal basis populations of different sized Daphnia were not associated with significant differences in Chi a. Filtration potential per se was the major determinant of Chi a, regardless of which Daphnia species dominated. However, in pulicaria lakes, the clear-water phase started earlier, lasted longer, and was usually characterized by greater Secchi disc readings than in galeata lakes. For large blue-green algae such as Aphanizomenon, D. pulicaria appeared to delay bloom conditions, but ultimately did not prevent the alga from growing. Our results suggest that high densities of large-sized Daphnia are a desirable goal of biomanipulation because they can attain filtration potentials high enough to increase summer water clarity in eutrophic lakes.

J	Wang, P; Lai, GY; Li, L				Wang, Peng; Lai, Geying; Li, Lin			Predicting the Hydrological Impacts of the Poyang Lake Project Using an EFDC Model	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING												Dams have great hydrological impacts on the river system. Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, has experienced severe drought over the past decade since the operation of the Three Georges Dam. The Jiangxi Province Government proposed to build a 2.8-km-wide dam with sluice gates across the narrowest part of the channel that links Poyang Lake and Yangtze River, called the Poyang Lake Project (PLP), to solve the problem of drought. The proposal caused concerns about the negative effect of increased water level on wintering birds' habitat and water quality. But so far, little scientific data have been provided to evaluate the hydrological impacts of the PLP. The aim of this study is to investigate the hydrological impacts of the PLP using a two-dimensional Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) model based on the latest regulation scheme, which will be helpful to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the building of PLP. The model was calibrated and verified by comparing model predictions with observed data. A typical dry season between 2006 and 2007 was used as the period to simulate the scenarios with and without the PLP. Simulated results from the EFDC model showed that the increase of water depth mainly occurred in the water channel in the north part of Poyang Lake with the regulated water level set at 10-11 m, and the increased water depth in two national nature reserves was less than 0.1 m, which has little effect on wintering birds' habitat. However, the benefit of the PLP was limited with this regulated water level and the increased water storage was less than 6.2 x 10(8) m(3). The increased water storage would double when the lowest water level was set at 12 m, and the bird habitat was still little affected. The existing regulated water level reduced the flow velocity in the northern part of Poyang Lake by approximately 50% and the effect became smaller with distance far away from the PLP. The slowdown of flow velocity would increase the eutrophication risk and the water quality would deteriorate if the regulated water level was set higher. Whether the project should go ahead depends on how to balance the advantages and disadvantages.

We demonstrate that the pattern and absolute values of mean annual temperatures reconstructed using the eastern African lake brGDGTs calibration based on the methylation of 5-methyl branched tetraethers index provided the most reliable and accurate temperature estimates from the site. The results resemble regional and Northern Hemisphere changes over this period. The pattern shows a general cool period between ca. AD 1450 and 1950, including cooling minima centred at ca. AD 1600, 1750 and 1900, coeval with the 'Little Ice Age' temperature fluctuations in the Northern Hemisphere, followed by a warming trend from the mid-20th century to the present. The results suggest that both solar forcing and high-latitude Northern Hemisphere climate fluctuations play a role in influencing the terrestrial temperatures in southern China, possibly on different timescales. In addition, our results support the hypothesis that changes of the East Asian summer monsoon are primarily driven by the land-sea thermal gradient change between terrestrial southern China and the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool regions during the last millennium, owing to external radiative and/or volcanic forcings.					shulmeister, james/J-2859-2015; Wang, Luo/A-1430-2009; Chang, Jie/R-2763-2016; Zhang, Youchi/M-6989-2016; Shulmeister, James/J-2859-2015	shulmeister, james/0000-0001-5863-9462; Zhang, Enlou/0000-0002-8057-7760; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				MAY	2020	30	5					709	720	0959683619895578	10.1177/0959683619895578	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683619895578		JAN 2020											WOS:000507188300001

The results showed that the evaporation fractionation of lake water was the strongest (lc-excess:-21.62%o), the evaporation fractionation of thermokarst lake water was the second strongest (lc-excess:-15.33%o), and the evaporation fractionation of river water was weak (lc-excess:-0.30%o) during the extreme drought event. Compared to the previous years, the strongest isotopic enrichment of surface water during the extreme drought occurred in lake water (E(818O): 58.61%), followed by thermokarst lake water (E(818O): 48.18%), while that in river water was weak (E(818O): 9.41%). Solar radiation was the main environmental factor controlling isotopic variations among different surface water. The ratios of evaporation to inflow of surface water caused the greatest isotopic enrichment to be found in lakes. Therefore, the occurrence of extreme drought events resulted in the lake water isotopic signal being the strongest evaporation enrichment reaction. The extreme drought event that occurred in the summer of 2022 intensified the evaporation enrichment of different surface waters on the eastern QTP. The results provide new insights into the surface water feedback climate change over the QTP.

J	Nicholls, KH				Nicholls, KH			Evidence for a trophic cascade effect on north-shore western Lake Erie phytoplankton prior to the zebra mussel invasion	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Increasing summer total phosphorus (TP) concentrations measured in samples from a municipal water intake off the north shore of western Lake Erie during 1976 to 1983 were inconsistent with TP loads tot eh western basin of Lake Erie and with phytoplankton densities in the intake samples, both of which declined over the same time interval. The long-term (1976 to 1988) summer TP data were inversely correlated (r = -0.858) with summer average maximum daily wind velocities, suggesting that low wind velocities contributed to anoxia at the sediment-water interface and high sediment TP release rates in summer. While TP loading reductions in the late 1960's and early 1970s likely contributed to phytoplankton declines, continued phytoplankton declines during the late 1970s to early 1980s could not have been caused by continued reductions in TP loadings while TP concentrations increased. The phytoplankton declines of the 1980s are more likely attributable to changes in the trophic cascade associated with dramatic declines in some species of zooplankivorous fish during the 1970s and 1980s as a result of a restored walleye population. Long term phytoplankton densities were fit (R-2 = 0.902) to a multiple regression model with western Lake Erie TP loads and an index of zooplanktivore density as independent variables; the zooplanktivore component of this model was the most significant contributor ti the prediction of phytoplankton density. The implications of these findings for maintenance of good lake water quality include the need to maintain strong piscivore populations as well as reduced phosphorus loads.																			0380-1330						1999	25	4					942	949		10.1016/S0380-1330(99)70791-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(99)70791-4													WOS:000085976300029

The taxonomic composition of bacterial communities inhabiting these still active natural habitats is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to reveal and compare the bacterial diversity of upwelling thermal waters, rock surface biofilms, and cave deposits using high-throughput next-generation sequencing. Two thermal karst caves formed in carbonate rocks and located at the discharging endpoints of the Transdanubian Range (Hungary) were studied: a sublacustrine spring cave and a phreatic hypogene cave. The results of 16S rRNA gene-based Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing revealed that almost all samples were dominated by Proteobacteria and/or Epsilonbacteraeota. Other abundant phyla showed habitat-dependent and diverse distributions. Sequences of the thermal waters were mainly associated with different chemolithotrophic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (genera Thiovirga, Thiofaba, and Arcobacter in the sublacustrine thermal spring cave, whereas genera Sulfurovum, Sulfuricurvum, and Sulfurifustis were characteristic of the phreatic hypogene thermal cave) in accordance with the difference in environmental parameters. Sequences belonging to ammonia-oxidizing (unclassified Nitrosococcaceae) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (Nitrospira) were characteristic of the hypogene cave. Sequences related to photoautotrophic bacteria from the lake water and chemoheterotrophic bacteria from the sediment were only found in the sublacustrine spring cave samples.					; Szabo, Attila/J-2208-2015; Borsodi, Andrea/H-1148-2017	Megyes, Melinda/0000-0002-7178-5883; Szabo, Attila/0000-0002-7777-8166; Borsodi, Andrea/0000-0002-3738-7937													0149-0451	1521-0529				FEB 1	2022	39	2					155	165		10.1080/01490451.2021.2023709	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490451.2021.2023709		JAN 2022											WOS:000742951800001

Halosarcina pallida gen. nov., sp nov., a halophilic archaeon from a low-salt, sulfide-rich spring	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY												A novel halophilic archaeon, strain BZ256(T), was isolated from Zodletone Spring, a sulfide- and sulfur-rich spring in south-western Oklahoma, USA. Cells were non-motile, non-flagellated cocci that divided along two axes, resulting in the formation of sarcina-like clusters. Strain BZ256(T) grew at salt concentrations ranging from 1.3 to 4.3 M NaCl, with optimum growth at approximately 3.4 M, and required at least 1 MM Mg2+ for growth. The pH range for growth was 5.0 to at least 8.5, and the temperature range for growth was 25-45 degrees C. The two diether phospholipids that are typical of members of the order Halobacteriales, namely phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol phosphate methyl ester, were present in strain BZ256(T), as were two glycolipids chromatographically identical to S-DGD-1 and DGD-1. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain BZ256(T) showed 96.8 % similarity to that of the type strain of Halogeometricum borinquense, the closest recognized species within the order Halobacteriales. The DNA G + C content of strain BZ256(T) was 65.4 mol%. Microscopic, physiological, biochemical and phylogenetic; comparisons between strain BZ256(T) and recognized genera of extremely halophilic archaea suggest that this strain represents a member of a novel genus and species within the family Halobacteriaceae, for which the name Halosarcina pallida gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Halosarcina pallida is BZ256(T) (=KCTC 4017(T) =JCM 14848(T)).

Two rooted freshwater macrophytes (Lagarosiphon major (Ridley) Moss; Myriophyllum triphyllum Orchard) were grown in two lakes of differing trophic status on sediments collected from an eutrophic lake. In the two experiments (summer and winter) in the oligotrophic lake (Lake Taupo, New Zealand), the relative growth rates of both species were approximately double those recorded in the experiments in the eutrophic lake (Lake Rotorua, New Zealand). These growth responses occurred even though the light and temperature regimes were similar at the experimental sites in both lakes and the concentrations of inorganic nutrients were higher in the eutrophic lake water. 2. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) analysis of both lake waters indicated that the oligotrophic water had approximately 10-fold more DIC than the eutrophic water. This corresponded, at natural pH, to a 2-fold higher concentration of free-CO2 in the oligotrophic lake water (49-mu-M) than in the eutrophic lake water (23-mu-M). Photosynthetic experiments demonstrated that the maximum rates of photosynthesis were 2.46 and 2.25-fold higher in L. major and M. triphyllum, respectively, when the shoots were incubated in Lake Taupo water at Lake Taupo levels of free-CO2 relative to Lake Rotorua water at Lake Rotorua levels of free-CO2. 3. It is concluded that these differences in photosynthetic rates would lead approximately to a 2-fold difference in growth rate, thus explaining the growth responses observed in the field experiments.

This study estimates the N-2 fixation rates of urban rivers in the Yangtze Estuary area using acetylene reduction. The results demonstrate that the prominent spatiotemporal variability of river N-2 fixation rates is driven by various environmental factors. River N-2 fixation rates are significantly higher in the summer (90.57 +/- 14.60 ngN center dot L-1 center dot h(-1)) than in the winter (57.98 +/- 15.73 ngN center dot L-1 center dot h(-1)). Spatially, rivers draining urban and suburban areas have higher N-2 fixation rates than those draining rural areas. The N-2 fixation rates are positively correlated with the N-2 fixing cyanobacteria density, water temperature, light, and the water phosphorus (P) concentration, but they are negatively correlated with the dissolved N concentration (NH4+-N and NO3--N). The N-2 fixation rates annually range from 53.20 to 89.24 ngN center dot L-1 center dot h(-1) for all of the sampling rivers, which is equivalent to a depth integrated (0-0.6 m) N input of 0.163-0.274 gN center dot m(-2)center dot a(-1). The determined annual N input via N-2 fixation is generally higher than that of marine systems, but it is lower than that of eutrophic lakes. This study provides robust evidence that N-2 fixation can supply a substantial portion of the N input to human-impacted river ecosystems, which has not been sufficiently accounted for when determining the N mass balance of riverine ecosystems. A high N-2 fixation rate may increase the ratio of N to P input to river systems, and therefore render P the limiting factor in aquatic eutrophication.

J	Fink, G; Wessels, M; Wüest, A				Fink, Gabriel; Wessels, Martin; Wuest, Alfred			Flood frequency matters: Why climate change degrades deep-water quality of peri-alpine lakes	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Sediment-laden riverine floods transport large quantities of dissolved oxygen into the receiving deep layers of lakes. Hence, the water quality of deep lakes is strongly influenced by the frequency of riverine floods. Although flood frequency reflects climate conditions, the effects of climate variability on the water quality of deep lakes is largely unknown. We quantified the effects of climate variability on the potential shifts in the flood regime of the Alpine Rhine, the main catchment of Lake Constance, and determined the intrusion depths of riverine density-driven underflows and the subsequent effects on water exchange rates in the lake. A simplified hydrodynamic underflow model was developed and validated with observed river inflow and underflow events. The model was implemented to estimate underflow statistics for different river inflow scenarios. Using this approach, we integrated present and possible future flood frequencies to underflow occurrences and intrusion depths in Lake Constance. The results indicate that more floods will increase the number of underflows and the intensity of deep-water renewal and consequently will cause higher deep-water dissolved oxygen concentrations. Vice versa, fewer floods weaken deep-water renewal and lead to lower deep-water dissolved oxygen concentrations. Meanwhile, a change from glacial nival regime (present) to a nival pluvial regime (future) is expected to decrease deep-water renewal. While flood frequencies are not expected to change noticeably for the next decades, it is most likely that increased winter discharge and decreased summer discharge will reduce the number of deep density-driven underflows by 10% and favour shallower riverine interflows in the upper hypolimnion. The renewal in the deepest layers is expected to be reduced by nearly 27%. This study underlines potential consequences of climate change on the occurrence of deep river under flows and water residence times in deep lakes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Despite very low sulfate concentrations, this mat community was shown to sustain a highly active sulfur cycle. The highest rates of sulfate respiration were measured close to the surface of the mat late in the day when photosynthetic oxygen production ceased and were associated with a Thermodesuffiovibrio-like population. Reduced activity at greater depths was correlated with novel populations of sulfate-reducing microorganisms, unrelated to characterized species, and most likely due to both sulfate and carbon limitation.					; Webb, Samuel/D-4778-2009	Dillon, Jesse/0000-0002-8582-1937; 													0099-2240					AUG	2007	73	16					5218	5226		10.1128/AEM.00357-07	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00357-07								17575000					WOS:000248825900019

Current state of phytoplankton in the littoral area of Lake Baikal, spring 2017	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH					International Conference on Freshwater Ecosystems - Key Problems	SEP 10-14, 2018	Irkutsk, RUSSIA					To assess the current state of phytoplankton in the littoral area of Lake Baikal and provide a baseline for future comparisons, we sampled spring plankton communities from the 44 littoral and 3 pelagic stations covering all three basins of the lake. The study examined chemical parameters of water (NH4+, NO2-, NO3-, PO4-3, Si, COD), species composition, abundance, and biomass of phytoplankton in Lake Baikal during late spring 2017. Sharp spatial heterogeneity was observed in the distribution of phytoplankton biomass along the western (399 +/- 72 mg/m(3)) and eastern (1319 +/- 220 mg/m(3)) shores of the lake. The phytoplankton were diverse, with 79 species; dominant algae were different from site to site and from south to north throughout the lake. In Southern and Central Baikal, we recorded an intense bloom of the diatom Synedra acus subsp. radians (28-1400 cells/mL), similar to that observed for the past 10 years, while the chrysophyte Dinobryon cylindricum dominated in Northern Baikal. The diatoms Aulacoseira baicalensis, A. islandica, and Stephanodiscus meyeri that were dominant in the 1960s-1990s were not numerous in 2017 (0.5-10 cells/mL). This change in dominant species indicates structural changes in the phytoplankton of Lake Baikal, which have led to the disappearance of the main distinctive feature of the Baikalian phytoplankton - the alternation of extremely high (with the algal biomass over 1000 mg/m(3)) and extremely low (less than 100 mg/m(3)) productivity years. The ecological equilibrium appears to have shifted towards a new steady state. (C) 2019 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Krinner, G				Krinner, G			Impact of lakes and wetlands on boreal climate	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The role of lakes and wetlands in present-day high latitude climate is quantified using a general circulation model of the atmosphere. The atmospheric model includes a lake module which is presented and validated. Seasonal and spatial wetland distribution can either be prescribed or calculated as a function of the hydrological budget of the wetlands themselves and of continental soil whose runoff feeds them. Simulated wetland extent is discussed both in simulations forced by observed climate and in general circulation model simulations. In off-line simulations, forced by ECMWF reanalyses, the lake model simulates correctly observed lake ice durations, while the wetland extent is somewhat underestimated in the boreal regions. Coupled to the general circulation model, the lake model yields satisfying ice durations, although the climate model biases have impacts on the modeled lake ice conditions. Boreal wetland extents are overestimated in the general circulation model as simulated precipitation is too high. The impact of inundated surfaces on the simulated climate is strongest in summer when these surfaces are ice-free. Wetlands seem to play a more important role than lakes in cooling the boreal regions in summer and in humidifying the atmosphere.					; Krinner, Gerhard/A-6450-2011	Krinner, Gerhard/0000-0002-2959-5920; 													2169-897X					AUG 28	2003	108	D16							4520	10.1029/2002JD002597	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2002JD002597													WOS:000185251500002

Data on sediment composition were used to characterize changes in the depositional environment during the ontogenetic development of the Lake Temje. The analysis of fossil chironomid remains and statistical treatment of chironomid data by the application of a newly developed regional Russian transfer functions provided inferences of mean July air temperatures (T-July) and water depths (WD). Reconstructed WDs show minor changes throughout the core and range between 80 and 120 cm. All the fluctuations in reconstructed water depth lie within the mean error of prediction of the inference model (RMSEP = 0.35) so it is not possible to draw conclusions from the reconstructions. A qualitative and quantitative reconstruction of Holocene climate in central Yakutia recognized three stages of palaeoenvironmental changes. The early Holocene between 10 and 8 ka BP was characterized by colder-than-today and moist summer conditions. Cryotextures in the lake sediments document full freezing of the lake water during the winter time. A general warming trend started around 8.0 ka BP in concert with enhanced biological productivity. Reconstructed mean T-July were equal or up to 1.5 degrees C higher than today between 6.0 ka and 5.0 ka BP. During the entire late Holocene after 4.8 ka BP, reconstructed mean T-July remained below modern value. Limnological conditions did not change significantly. The inference of a mid-Holocene climate optimum supports scenarios of Holocene climatic changes in the subpolar part of eastern Siberia and indicates climate teleconnections to the North Atlantic realm.

Thermally driven circulation in a region of complex topography: comparison of wind-profiling radar measurements and MM5 numerical predictions	ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE												The diurnal variation of regional wind patterns in the complex terrain of Central Italy was investigated for summer fair-weather conditions and winter time periods using a radar wind profiler. The profiler is located on a site where interaction between the complex topography and land-surface produces a variety of thermally and dynamically driven wind systems. The observational data set, collected for a period of one year, was used first to describe the diurnal evolution of thermal driven winds, second to validate the Mesoscale Model 5 (MM5) that is a three-dimensional numerical model. This type of analysis was focused on the near-surface wind observation, since thermally driven winds occur in the lower atmosphere. According to the valley wind theory expectations, the site - located on the left sidewall of the valley (looking up valley) - experiences a clockwise turning with time. Same characteristics in the behavior were established in both the experimental and numerical results. Because the thermally driven flows can have some depth and may be influenced mainly by model errors, as a third step the analysis focuses on a subset of cases to explore four different MM5 Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) parameterizations. The reason is to test how the results are sensitive to the selected PBL parameterization, and to identify the better parameterization if it is possible. For this purpose we analysed the MM5 output for the whole PBL levels. The chosen PBL parameterizations are: 1) Gayno-Seaman; 2) Medium-Range Forecast; 3) Mellor-Yamada scheme as used in the ETA model; and 4) Blackadar.

Although the size of the spawning stock of bream was rather stable during this period, analysis of length-frequency distributions indicates that it comprised only a few year-classes. The strength of a year-class was determined at a fork length of about ii cm, at the end of the second summer. Mortality rates of fish larger than 11 cm were low (<50% year(-1)). As the number of fish at the end of the second summer was not correlated to the number of Dc in the previous year, mortality rates during the second summer (ranging from 75.6 to 97.7% year(-1)) determine the final year-class strength. These mortality rates were positively correlated to the year-class strength of 2- to 4-year-old pikeperch.

Differential growth in estuarine and freshwater habitats indicated by plasma IGF1 concentrations and otolith chemistry in Dolly Varden Salvelinus malma	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												This study employed a combination of otolith microchemistry to indicate the recent habitat use, and plasma concentrations of the hormone insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) as an index of recent growth rate, to demonstrate differences in growth and habitat use by Dolly Varden Salvelinus malma occupying both freshwater and estuarine habitats in south-west Alaska. Extensive sampling in all habitats revealed that fish had higher IGF1 levels in estuarine compared to lake habitats throughout the summer, and that the growth rates in different habitats within the estuary varied seasonally. In addition, otolith microchemistry indicated differentiation in estuarine habitat use among individual S. malma throughout summer months. Although growth in the estuary was higher than in fresh water in nearly all sites and months, the benefits and use of the estuarine habitats varied on finer spatial scales. Therefore, this study further illustrates the diverse life histories of S. malma and indicates an evaluation of the benefits of marine waters needs to include sub-estuary scale habitat use.

A reconstruction of early- and mid-Holocene vegetation around Lake Kagaoarholl, Northwest Iceland, examines how climate fluctuations have affected the terrestrial ecosystem. A thorough reconstruction has been made using pollen and plant macrofossil analyses combined with proxies for organic and inorganic matter. The record shows the development from a period of pioneer vegetation towards a woodland ecosystem. The deposition of the Saksunarvatn tephra at c. 10,300 cal. yr BP caused a 100-year period of instability, followed by a gradual trend of stabilization over several centuries while material left behind by retreating glaciers and tephra was being contained by expanding and developing vegetation. Early-Holocene warmth is indicated by high pollen production of Juniperus communis around the lake by c. 10,100 cal. yr BP and birch woodland being established around the lake by c. 9200 cal. yr BP, much earlier than previously believed for this locale. Cooling climate between c. 8700 and 8200 cal. yr BP halted woodland development, with reduced plant reproduction likely caused by cold spring and summer temperatures. Woodlands became re-established from c. 7900 cal. yr BP before entering a decline from c. 6000 cal. yr BP, with harsher environmental conditions apparent after c. 4200 cal. yr BP. The Kagaoarholl record compares favourably with other palaeoclimatic data from the North Atlantic, demonstrating the potential of pollen and macrofossil data for reconstructions of environmental change in Iceland and as an indicator of climate variability in the North Atlantic during the Holocene.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				SEP	2015	25	9					1437	1453		10.1177/0959683615585839	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683615585839													WOS:000360004500007

Late-Holocene seasonal moisture variability: Range Creek Canyon, Utah, USA	HOLOCENE												A 3300 year-long reconstruction of paleoenvironmental moisture conditions was constructed from a sediment core from North Gate Bog (NGB) in the northern section of Range Creek Canyon within the Colorado Plateau. The methods used to analyze the record include loss on ignition (LOI), magnetic susceptibility (MS), elemental analysis with X-ray fluorescence (XRF), charcoal influx, isotopic analysis, elemental ratios and pollen percentages, influx, and ratios. This study adds two new insights to the paleoenvironmental record of the northern section of the Colorado Plateau. First, four climatic zones were established. Zone 1 (3300-2750 cal yr BP) had 100-year wet to dry variations with droughts recorded from 3300-3200, 3000-2900, and 2800-2700 cal yr BP. Zone 2 (2750-1600 cal yr BP) had an overall dry period with an 800-year transition to increased warmth and winter moisture. Zone 3 (1600-850 cal yr BP) had an overall warm, wet, summer precipitation climate conducive to the establishment of Zea Mays and Pinus edulis, two staple foods of the Fremont culture. The Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) registered warm and wet in this part of the Colorado Plateau. Zone 4 (850-0 cal yr BP) had a sharp transition to a drier climate from 850 to 400 cal yr BP. During the Little Ice Age (LIA), wetter climate taxon increases such as Artemisia, Cyperaceae, and Pinus edulis. The second overall finding in this study was that NGB was a place of human activity including Fremont farming. The identification of a Zea mays pollen grain confirms the archeological presumptions that this higher elevation site was used to farm corn along with other sites in Range Creek Canyon (RCC). The post Fremont occupation period was marked by a sharp increase in organic material and a return of pinyon-juniper woodlands.

LeAnn; Zuckerberg, Benjamin			Environmental conditions synchronize waterbird mortality events in the Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Since the 1960s, periodic outbreaks of avian botulism type E have contributed to large-scale die-offs of thousands of waterbirds throughout the Great Lakes of the United States. In recent years, these events have become more common and widespread. Occurring during the summer and autumn months, the prevalence of these die-offs varies across years and is often associated with years of warmer lake temperatures and lower water levels. Little information exists on how environmental conditions mediate the spatial and temporal characteristics of mortality events. 2. In 2010, a citizen science programme, Avian Monitoring for Botulism Lakeshore Events (AMBLE), was launched to enhance surveillance efforts and detect the appearance of beached waterbird carcasses associated with avian botulism type E outbreaks in northern Lake Michigan. Using these data, our goal was to quantify the within-year characteristics of mortality events for multiple species, and to test whether the synchrony of these events corresponded to fluctuations in two environmental factors suspected to be important in the spread of avian botulism: water temperature and the prevalence of green macroalgae. 3. During two separate events of mass waterbird mortality, we found that the detection of bird carcasses was spatially synchronized at scales of c. 40 km. Notably, the extent of this spatial synchrony in avian mortality matched that of fluctuations in lake surface water temperatures and the prevalence of green macroalgae. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our findings are suggestive of a synchronizing effect where warmer lake temperatures and the appearance of macroalgae mediate the characteristics of avian mortality. In future years, rising lake temperatures and a higher propensity of algal masses could lead to increases in the magnitude and synchronization of avian mortality due to botulism. We advocate that citizen-based monitoring efforts are critical for identifying the potential environmental conditions associated with widespread mortality events and estimating future risk to waterbird populations.

A period of thermal instability following this bloom collapse, or coincidental with it, is a necessary requirement. Wind stress and nighttime air temperature are the principal factors determining the degree of thermal stability. This may explain the speed with which O2 depletion can occur, that the occurrence of algal biomass collapses without severe O2 depletion (partial collapses), and the correlation between the occurrence of periods of lake O2 depletion and changing weather conditions.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1980	37	9					1433	1438		10.1139/f80-183	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f80-183													WOS:A1980KK67300012

It is also suggested that this winter oxidized layer may disappear mainly from the surface downward, owing to the greater O2 consumption there brought about by decomposition of sedimented plankton.

Salt deposits correspond to relatively extreme climate events. However, due to insufficient independent temperature proxies, there is a lack of paleotemperature records obtained from salt laminae depositions. Here, we measured fluid inclusion by microthermometry to study halite samples from the third member of the Qianjiang Formation in the Qianjiang Depression, Jianghan Basin, central China. Following approprite sample preparation measures, homogenization temperatures (Th) of primary fluid inclusions in chevron and cumulate halite crystals that can represent air temperatures at the time of deposition, were plotted in two separate ranges: 12.1-29.9 degrees C and 36.2-47.2 degrees C, representing winter and summer temperature fluctuations, respectively. In comparison with modern evaporative environments and temperatures calculated from oxygen isotopes in mudstones and dolomites that are spatially related to our halite samples it was found that the annual temperature fluctuations in the middle Eocene of the Jianghan Basin has been very similar to the Badwater Basin in Death Valley. Furthermore, the salt rhythms were mainly controlled by water influx and evaporation capacity rather than the elevated temperatures. Ultimately, statistical analysis of the homogenization temperature data and cross-plots of the carbon and oxygen isotopes revealed a monsoon climate that could have been more likely to prevail during the middle Eocene epoch of the Jianghan Basin.					ostadhassan, mehdi/AAE-4941-2020; Wu, Zhongrui/MYA-9410-2025; Chen, Honghan/AFC-2891-2022; Tarantola, Alexandre/A-8339-2012														0264-8172	1873-4073				JUL	2023	153								106305	10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2023.106305	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2023.106305		MAY 2023											WOS:000999355500001

The genetic basis of anoxygenic photosynthetic arsenite oxidation	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Photoarsenotrophy', the use of arsenite as an electron donor for anoxygenic photosynthesis, is thought to be an ancient form of phototrophy along with the photosynthetic oxidation of Fe(II), H2S, H-2 and Photoarsenotrophy was recently identified from Paoha Island's (Mono Lake, CA) arsenic-rich hot springs. The genomes of several photoarsenotrophs revealed a gene cluster, arxB2AB1CD, where arxA is predicted to encode for the sole arsenite oxidase. The role of arxA in photosynthetic arsenite oxidation was confirmed by disrupting the gene in a representative photoarsenotrophic bacterium, resulting in the loss of light-dependent arsenite oxidation. In situ evidence of active photoarsenotrophic microbes was supported by arxA mRNA detection for the first time, in red-pigmented microbial mats within the hot springs of Paoha Island. This work expands on the genetics for photosynthesis coupled to new electron donors and elaborates on known mechanisms for arsenic metabolism, thereby highlighting the complexities of arsenic biogeochemical cycling.					; Rosen, Michael/D-6091-2015	Miller, Laurence/0000-0002-7807-3475; Rosen, Michael/0000-0003-3991-0522; Sullivan, William/0000-0002-1756-4174													1462-2912	1462-2920				JAN	2017	19	1					130	141		10.1111/1462-2920.13509	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.13509								27555453					WOS:000393587200020

Temporal trends in methane emissions from a small eutrophic reservoir: the key role of a spring burst	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Waters impounded behind dams (i.e., reservoirs) are important sources of greenhouses gases (GHGs), especially methane (CH4), but emission estimates are not well constrained due to high spatial and temporal variability, limitations in monitoring methods to characterize hot spot and hot moment emissions, and the limited number of studies that investigate diurnal, seasonal, and interannual patterns in emissions. In this study, we investigate the temporal patterns and biophysical drivers of CH4 emissions from Acton Lake, a small eutrophic reservoir, using a combination of methods: eddy covariance monitoring, continuous warm-season ebullition measurements, spatial emission surveys, and measurements of key drivers of CH4 production and emission. We used an artificial neural network to gap fill the eddy covariance time series and to explore the relative importance of biophysical drivers on the interannual timescale. We combined spatial and temporal monitoring information to estimate annual whole-reservoir emissions. Acton Lake had cumulative areal emission rates of 45.6 +/- 8.3 and 51.4 +/- 4.3 gCH(4) m(-2) in 2017 and 2018, respectively, or 109 +/- 14 and 123 +/- 10MgCH(4) in 2017 and 2018 across the whole 2.4 km(2) area of the lake. The main difference between years was a period of elevated emissions lasting less than 2 weeks in the spring of 2018, which contributed 17% of the annual emissions in the shallow region of the reservoir. The spring burst coincided with a phytoplankton bloom, which was likely driven by favorable precipitation and temperature conditions in 2018 compared to 2017. Combining spatially extensive measurements with temporally continuous monitoring enabled us to quantify aspects of the spatial and temporal variability in CH4 emission. We found that the relationships between CH4 emissions and sediment temperature depended on location within the reservoir, and we observed a clear spatiotemporal offset in maximum CH4 emissions as a function of reservoir depth. These findings suggest a strong spatial pattern in CH4 biogeochemistry within this relatively small (2.4 km(2)) reservoir. In addressing the need for a better understanding of GHG emissions from reservoirs, there is a trade-off in intensive measurements of one water body vs. short-term and/or spatially limited measurements in many water bodies. The insights from multi-year, continuous, spatially extensive studies like this one can be used to inform both the study design and emission upscaling from spatially or temporally limited results, specifically the importance of trophic status and intra-reservoir variability in assumptions about upscaling CH4 emissions.

Wind-Induced Hypolimnetic Upwelling Between the Multi-Depth Basins of Lake Geneva During Winter: An Overlooked Deepwater Renewal Mechanism?	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Combining field observations, 3D hydrodynamic modeling, and particle tracking, we investigated wind-induced interbasin exchange between the Petit Lac (PL) (depth 75 m) and Grand Lac (GL) (depth 309 m) basins of Lake Geneva in early winter. Following a strong 2.5-day wind event, a two-layer flow field developed, where the downwind surface drift into the GL was balanced by counterflowing hypolimnetic currents into the PL. Velocities in both layers exceeded 20 cm s(-1), with the highest values (27 cm s(-1)) found near the bottom. For 3.5 days, hypolimnetic temperatures at the confluence decreased to values found in the deep GL hypolimnion at 180-m depth. Approximately 1.5 days after the wind event ceased, currents reversed and upwelled waters returned into the deep GL hypolimnion. The Coriolis force strongly modified the interbasin exchange dynamics, which were well represented by the model. Particle tracking revealed a "current loop," that is, water from below 150-m depth first upwelled into the PL, intruded approximately 10 km (half its length), and then descended back into the GL hypolimnion. Model results showed that the PL hypolimnetic volume doubled during the upwelling. Low model-based gradient Richardson numbers and temperature inversions in CTD profiles indicated turbulent mixing between the upwelled GL and surrounding PL waters. Our findings demonstrate that hypolimnetic upwelling between the two basins frequently occurs during winter and could potentially be an important, but as yet overlooked mechanism for hypolimnetic-epilimnetic exchange and deepwater renewal in Lake Geneva, and probably in other multi-depth basin lakes under similar wind conditions.

Trophic state indicators are a better predictor of Florida bass condition compared to temperature in Florida's freshwater bodies	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Forecasted increases in global temperatures will likely have profound effects on freshwater fishes. Overlaid on increasing global temperatures, human populations are expected to grow, which will increase anthropogenic nutrient enrichment in freshwater ecosystems. Florida (US) represents the equatorial range limit for many freshwater fishes, thus these species are potentially at risk to climate warming. Likewise, Florida's population is expected to aggressively expand, increasing risk for nutrient enrichment. In this study, we examined whether maximum water temperatures or trophic state indicators (a proxy for nutrient enrichment) better explains variation in Florida Bass (Micropterus salmoides floridanus) condition across 23 different Florida freshwater bodies distributed throughout the state. Florida Bass lengths and weights, temperature, and chlorophyll-alpha, total phosphorous (TP), and total nitrogen (TN) measures were collected in the late summer and fall from 2010 to 2012. We described relationships between bass relative condition and environmental measurements (temperature, and trophic state indicators) across these lake-year combinations using linear and non-linear regressions. We found no significant relationship between temperature and bass condition (r(2) = 0.01). However, we found that trophic state indicators did predict bass condition (r(2) = 0.39-0.50). Though research is needed to more rigorously assess the effects of rising temperature on bass condition, our results may suggest that lake productivity is currently an influential driver on Florida Bass. As such, management efforts should continue to closely monitor and manage water quality and potential nutrient enrichment in Florida's freshwater waters, as bass condition appears to be closely tied to lake productivity.					; Wilson, Kyle/J-5800-2019	Wilson, Kyle/0000-0002-0870-0509; Young, Joy/0000-0002-3896-3406; 													0378-1909	1573-5133				OCT	2017	100	10					1181	1192		10.1007/s10641-017-0635-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-017-0635-9													WOS:000412840700003
J	Mudelsee, M				Mudelsee, Manfred			A proxy record of winter temperatures since 1836 from ice freeze-up/breakup in lake Nasijarvi, Finland	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												One obstacle on the way to a comprehensive spatial reconstruction of regional temperature changes over the past centuries is the sparseness of long winter temperature records. This paper reconstructs a proxy record of April and November-December temperatures in south-central Finland for the interval from 1836 to 1872 from breakup and freeze-up dates and ice-cover duration of a lake. Emphasis is on detecting the suitable winter months and quantifying the calibrations with measured temperatures (1873-2002). The calibration slope for the breakup date (0.158 degrees C/day) is larger than for freeze-up date (0.119 degrees C/day) or duration (0.090 degrees C/day). A comparison with results from other proxy records shows that the slope may depend also on the geographical site. Trend analyses of the full temperature records (1836-2002) indicate the existence of minor change-points at around 1867 (April temperature) and 1874 (November-December temperature), with warming rates thereafter of 1.67 degrees C per century (April) and 1.16 degrees C per century (November-December). Spectral analyses reveal peaks in the band between 2 and 5 year period, which may point to influences of the North Atlantic Oscillation, and less power in the decadal band (up to 42 year period).

J	Garvey, JE; Stein, RA				Garvey, JE; Stein, RA			Competition between larval fishes in reservoirs: The role of relative timing of appearance	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												In small, hypereutrophic reservoirs (<100 ha; >100 mu g total phosphorus/L), larval gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum and threadfin shad D. petenense thenceforth, shad) reach high densities in the limnetic zone, virtually eliminate zooplankton: and perhaps compromise success of other planktivorous larvae, such as bluegill Lepomis macrochirus. Because relative timing of appearance of shad and bluegills probably influences their relative success, we quantified densities of fish larvae and zooplankton during spring through summer in three reservoirs across 8 years (1987-1994), and we conducted three hatchery experiments with varying larval appearance times and gizzard shad densities in plastic bags (1 m(3)). When shad were abundant in reservoirs, bluegill abundance often peaked either at the same time (36% of reservoirs and years combined) or after (40% of reservoirs and years combined) shad peaks. When gizzard shad were placed in bags 2 weeks before bluegills (N = 1 experiment), they depleted zooplankton, reducing growth (similar to 0.075 g . g(-1) . d(-1)) but not survival of bluegills. In experiments (N = 2) in which both species were added simultaneously, zooplankton declined only slightly with gizzard shad, and there was little effect on bluegill growth (similar to 0.21 g . g(-1) . d(-1)) and survival; in general, gizzard shad growth declined with time and increasing gizzard shad density. Based on experiments, bluegill success should vary among reservoirs and years as a function of their appearance relative to gizzard shad. In reservoirs, zooplankton availability and bluegill abundances were consistently low during years when gizzard shad dominated reservoir fish assemblages. Because gizzard shad probably reduce bluegill success in hypereutrophic Ohio reservoirs, management strategies that reduce gizzard shad should improve bluegill success.

Elemental composition of aerosols in Daihai, a rural area in the front boundary of the summer Asian monsoon	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												TSP and PM2.5 were sampled in Daihai, an Asian monsoon-sensitive region in Inner Mongolia, in summer. The aims were to evaluate the characteristics of trace elements and to investigate the influence of the summer monsoon on elemental composition there. Eighteen trace elements, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Br, Sr, Zr and Pb, were determined and their concentrations were evaluated. The TSP/PM2.5 ratio of element concentrations showed that crustal elements like K, Ca, Ti and Fe, as well as Pb, Ni and Sr were more abundant in TSP, while other elements predominated in PM2.5. Enrichment factor (EF) calculations revealed that non-crustal trace elements were more enriched in PM2.5 than in TSP. Back trajectory analysis indicated that crustal elements such as K, Ca, Ti and Fe had distinctly high concentrations associated with northerly flows, while non-crustal elements showed no clear pattern. However, non-crustal elements showed high EF values related to southeasterly flows. Principal component analysis (PCA) was also applied to the PM2.5 data to discuss the source appointment and five factors were determined. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Prehistoric fire area and emissions from California's forests, woodlands, shrublands, and grasslands	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												In the majority of US political settings wildland fire is still discussed as a negative force. Lacking from current wildfire discussions are estimates of the spatial extent of fire and their resultant emissions before the influences of Euro-American settlement and this is the focus of this work. We summarize the literature on fire history (fire rotation and fire return intervals) and past Native American burning practices to estimate past fire occurrence by vegetation type. Once past fire intervals were established they were divided into the area of each corresponding vegetation type to arrive at estimates of area burned annually. Finally, the First Order Fire Effects Model was used to estimate emissions. Approximately 1.8 million ha burned annually in California prehistorically (pre 1800). Our estimate of prehistoric annual area burned in California is 88% of the total annual wildfire area in the entire US during a decade (1994-2004) characterized as "extreme" regarding wildfires. The idea that US wildfire area of approximately two million ha annually is extreme is certainly a 20th or 21st century perspective. Skies were likely smoky much of the summer and fall in California during the prehistoric period. Increasing the spatial extent of fire in California is an important management objective. The best methods to significantly increase the area burned is to increase the use of wildland fire use (WFU) and appropriate management response (AMR) suppression fire in remote areas. Political support for increased use of WFU and AMR needs to occur at local, state, and federal levels because increasing the spatial scale of fire will increase smoke and inevitability, a few WFU or AMR fires will escape their predefined boundaries.

Diatom communities have been shown to respond strongly to current climate warming in remote lakes, while evidence remains equivocal for lakes under strong local human pressures. 2. Temporal dynamics of planktonic diatoms in three subalpine lakes (Geneva, Annecy and Bourget) reconstructed from palaeolimnological approaches were used to assess the relative effects of phosphorus concentrations, fisheries management practices and climate warming in structuring communities over the last century. 3. Changes in total phosphorous concentration (TP), air temperature and fish predation pressure could explain the temporal dynamics of most diatom species in the sediment records. TP was found to be not only the main driver of changes in community composition but also an important factor modulating diatom sensitivity and responses to climate warming. 4. The diatom community of Lake Bourget showed the highest vulnerability and direct responses to climate warming, favouring spring species that can resist earlier stratification in mesotrophic lakes (such as Asterionella formosa, Aulacoseira islandica and Stephanodiscus parvus) and summer species that can make the best trade-off between decreasing nutrient concentrations and increased water column stability (Diatoma tenuis, A. islandica). In Lake Geneva, climate warming also contributed to shaping diatom communities but through an indirect pathway; fisheries management practices and climate warming interacted to reinforce top-down control, favouring large, colonial inedible species (Stephanodicus binderanus and A. formosa). For Lake Annecy, the most nutrient limited of the three lakes studied, no changes in diatom community structure were directly related to warmer air temperatures over the last 25 years. 5. All three lakes have been subjected to the same climate variability. Yet the magnitude and responses of their diatom communities to climate warming were dissimilar and strongly modulated by differences in lake trophic status and fish management practices.

Parental Male Effects on Landlocked Fall Chinook Salmon Progeny Survival	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUACULTURE												The Lake Oahe, South Dakota, population of landlocked fall-run Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha is maintained entirely by hatchery propagation and exhibits relatively poor egg survival during hatchery incubation. This study was undertaken to determine the influence of male gametes on embryo survival. Eggs from an individual female were subdivided and subsequently fertilized with milt from four discrete males. This was repeated with three additional females using the milt from the same four males. This entire procedure was then replicated three times, using four new females and four new males each time, for a total of 16 males and 16 females. The eggs from each unique cross were then incubated discretely. There was no significant effect of spawning males on subsequent embryo survival to the eyed stage of egg development. Swim-up fry length and weight were also not significantly affected by male parentage. In contrast, there was a significant maternal effect on eyed egg survival, and swim-up fry length and weight, which varied significantly among progeny from individual females. These results suggest that the relatively poor survival exhibited by Lake Oahe landlocked fall Chinook salmon eggs during hatchery incubation is largely a function of initial egg quality from spawning females.																			1522-2055						2012	74	4					443	448		10.1080/15222055.2012.681105	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15222055.2012.681105													WOS:000309385900001
J	Rooney, N; Kalff, J				Rooney, N; Kalff, J			Submerged macrophyte-bed effects on water-column phosphorus, chlorophyll a, and bacterial production	ECOSYSTEMS												Submerged macrophytes are a major component of freshwater ecosystems, yet their net effect on water column phosphorus (P), algae, and bacterioplankton is not well understood. A 4-month mass-balance study during the summer quantified the net effect of a large (similar to5.5 ha) undisturbed macrophyte bed on these water-column properties. The bed is located in a slow-flowing (0.05-0.1 cm s(-1)) channel between two lakes, allowing for the quantification of inputs and outputs. The P budget for the study period showed that, despite considerable short-term variation, the macrophyte bed was a negligible net sink for P (0.06 mg m(-2) day(-1), range from -0.76 to +0.79 mg m(-2) day(-1)), demonstrating that loading and uptake processes in the weedbed roughly balance over the summer. Chlorophyll a was disproportionately retained relative to particulate organic carbon (POC), indicating that the algal component of the POC was preferentially trapped. However, the principal contribution of the weedbed to the open water was a consistent positive influence on bacterioplankton production over the summer. Conservative extrapolations based on measured August specific exports (m(-2) day(-1)) of P and bacterial production exiting the weedbed applied to five regional lakes varying in lake morphometry and macrophyte cover suggest that even in the most macrophyte dominated of lakes (66% cover), P loading from submerged weedbeds never exceeds 1% day(-1) of standing epilimnetic P levels, whereas subsidization of bacterioplankton production can reach upward of 20% day(-1). The presence of submerged macrophytes therefore differentially modifies algae and bacteria in the water column, while modestly altering P dynamics over the summer.

J	Du, YY; Zhong, W; Shang, ST; Wang, Z; Wang, XJ; Quan, MY; Li, TH				Du, Yingyi; Zhong, Wei; Shang, Shengtan; Wang, Zhi; Wang, Xiaojun; Quan, Mingying; Li, Tianhang			Environmental magnetic records derived from lacustrine sediments in the Western Guangdong Province, China: Implications for Late-Holocene climatic/environmental changes	HOLOCENE												The western Guangdong Province (WGDP) in China, influenced by both the East Asian and the Indian summer monsoon, is a pivotal region for exploring the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) evolution. So far, there still lacks detail studies on late Holocene climatic/environmental changes here. In this study, multiple magnetic parameters were measured on the lake sediments of Hedong section in this area. Results indicated a dominance of pseudo-single-domain detrital (titano-)magnetite or maghemite mixed with paramagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic minerals in sediments, and the impacts of authigenic greigite, bacterial activity, post-depositional dissolution, and dilution effects were trivial. Changes in rainfall-induced surface erosion intensity were determined as a role in sediment magnetic properties. Intensified surface erosion deduced by increased rainfall favored enhanced concentrations and more coarse-grained magnetic minerals in sediments, and vice versa. Thus, the magnetic parameters can be used to reflect varying ASM strength in the past similar to 4300 years. They revealed four relatively humid (strengthened ASM) (i.e., 4300-4000 cal. yr BP, 3500-3130 cal. yr BP, 2640-1950 cal. yr BP, and 1250-850 cal. yr BP), and three dry periods (weakened ASM) (i.e., 4000-3500 cal. yr BP, 3130-2640 cal. yr BP, and 1950-1250 cal. yr BP) which coincided with the Bond events 3, 2, and 1 respectively. In combination with the three significant cycles (i.e., 1250-, 75-, and 65-year) revealed by spectral analysis on SIRM record, we inferred both the external forcing (e.g., solar activity) and internal hemispheric-scale atmospheric processes (e.g., ENSO, North Atlantic Oscillation) have played an integral role in late Holocene climate changes in the study region.					; shang, shang/IYS-8177-2023; WANG, Xiao-Jun/L-7196-2018	Wang, Xiaojun/0000-0002-4572-3742; quan, mingying/0000-0003-3972-0841; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				NOV	2024	34	11					1534	1547		10.1177/09596836241266409	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836241266409		AUG 2024											WOS:001285576800001

Improving the representation of internal nutrient recycling with phosphorus mass balance models: A case study in the Bay of Quinte, Ontario, Canada	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												We evaluate the relative importance of the causal connection between exogenous total phosphorus (TP) loading and internal nutrient recycling with the water quality conditions in the Bay of Quinte, Ontario, Canada. First, we examine the temporal trends of all the major point and non-point loading sources over the last four decades. We then enhance the mechanistic foundation of an existing simple mass-balance total phosphorus (TP) model, originally developed to guide the eutrophication management in the system. The structural improvements include the incorporation of macrophyte dynamics, the explicit representation of the role of dreissenids in the system, and the improved portrayal of the interplay between water column and sediments. The upgraded model was in good agreement with the observed TP variability in the system during the study period (2002-2009) and successfully reproduced the TP accumulation patterns toward the end of the summer-early fall. We provide evidence that phosphorus dynamics in the upper Bay are predominantly driven by the inflows from Trent River, while the middle and lower segments likely receive substantial internal subsidies from the sediment diagenesis mechanisms and/or the activity of macrophytes and dreissenids (e.g., pseudofeces production, nutrient pump effect). We also forced the model with scenarios of reduced nutrient loading and examine the likelihood of the system to meet its water quality delisting targets, although we caution that our complex overparameterized modeling construct is primarily intended for heuristic purposes. The present study together with the companion paper by Zhang et al. (2013) illustrate how phosphorus mass balance models can offer useful tools for improving our understanding of freshwater ecosystems. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Algal pigments in Lake Erie dreissenids, pseudofeces and sediments, as tracers of diet, selective feeding and bioaccumulation	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Algal class biomarkers revealed the importance of diatoms and chlorophytes in the diet of dreissenids (n 18) collected from eastern lake Erie (2-20 m depths; hard and soft substrate), during summer and fall, from 2003 to 2005. The most prominent biomarkers in dreissenids, typical of August, were fatty acid esters of carotenoids derived from diatoms (monoesters of fucoxanthinol, average 61%) and chlorophytes (diesters of mactraxanthin, average 30%), while non-esterified biomarkers from diatoms, chlorophytes, cryptophytes and cyanobacteria were below 4% of the total. At cool temperatures (June 2003,13 degrees C), dreissenids had 84%:12% diatom:chlorophyte biomarkers, but with unseasonably warm temperatures (June 2004,18 degrees C) and a nearshore chlorophyte bloom, dreissenids had a biomarker distribution similar to August. Bioconcentration factors in dreissenids relative to phytoplankton from Lake Erie were largest for the biomarkers from diatoms (21 L/g ww) and chlorophytes (29 L/g ww), compared to those from cryptophytes (2 L/g ww) and cyanobacteria (3 L/g ww). Unlike dreissenids (2003), matching pseudofeces (n 6) and sediments (n 16) contained a relatively large percentage of biomarkers for cryptophytes (20% June, 27% August) and cyanobacteria (31% August), suggesting that their low levels in dreissenids represent ingested feces, which are being rejected. Increased shell size (12-27 mm; surrogate for age; 3 sets) corresponded to an increase in diatom biomarkers (from 60 to 73%) but a decrease in chlorophyte biomarkers (from 31 to 17%); biomarker concentrations also decreased significantly (-3000 pmol/g ww/mm) in the most offshore collection, near Buffalo (Oct. 2005).

To address this issue, we present an empirical DO depletion model from time-series measurements of hypolimnetic DO and water-column temperature profiles to estimate hypolimnion thickness (H). The model is based on a dataset that includes 3 temperate lakes (Lake Erie, Lake Simcoe, and Eagle Lake) in Ontario, Canada, of varying size and trophic state. We report SOD (mean [standard deviation]; 0.30 [0.07] g m(-2) d(-1)) and HOD (0.08 [0.03] g m(-3) d(-1)) values based on regression fits of dDO/dt (where t is time) and H from these lakes. The model shows that when vertical (through thermocline) and horizontal fluxes can be neglected in the DO budget during summer, SOD and HOD are the first-order parameters driving $d{\rm DO}/dt$dDO/dt. The empirical model predicted hypolimnetic DO in the 3 lakes (root-mean-square error [RMSE] of DO < 3.58 g m(-3)) and was subsequently validated against observations from a fourth lake (Little Silver Lake, Ontario; RMSE of DO = 1.07 g m(-3)). The model provides insight into the importance of physical characteristics (i.e., 1/H) in the hypolimnetic DO budget and the relative impact of physical transport versus biogeochemical sources and sinks in the DO budget. When the spring turnover DO concentration is known, the model can be used to simulate depletion of DO in the hypolimnion, including the onset of hypoxia, using routinely collected temperature profile data. We suggest that the proposed values for SOD and HOD can serve as estimates for water quality model calibration when no information is available.

Study focus: The hydrological process (HP), a vital part of the hydrological regime, notably affects biodiversity patterns in floodplain wetlands. However, the pathways through which hydrological process impacts the benthic macroinvertebrate biodiversity remain ambiguous. New hydrological insights for the region: Across the rising, flooding, and falling water level stages, HP indicators exhibited diverse relationships with biodiversity. During the rising and falling stages, the relationship manifested as an inverted U-shaped trend; in the flooding stage, the biodiversity exhibited a U-shaped decreasing trend. The impact of HPs on biodiversity was complex. In the rising stage, the HP exerted a direct influence on biodiversity, with a path coefficient of-0.633. Additionally, it indirectly affected biodiversity through water quality indicators, with an indirect path coefficient of-0.773. In the flooding stage, the HP exerted an indirect influence on biodiversity via water temperature and landscape indicators, with the corresponding path coefficients of 0.185 and-0.367, respectively. During the falling stage, the HP directly affected biodiversity, as indicated by a path coefficient of-0.564, and also indirectly influenced it through water temperature, with an indirect path coefficient of-0.799. Overall, the indirect effect was more prominent in the rising and falling stages, while the direct impact was insignificant in the flooding stage.

Shallow landslides triggered by earthquakes or heavy rainfall can cause a sudden and long-term deterioration in stream water quality by releasing contaminants into streams. Although many studies have been undertaken on the relationship between a single landslide and the water chemistry of a nearby river, little is known about the impact of densely distributed shallow landslides on stream water chemistry at the catchment scale. To this end, this study determined the major ion concentrations and isotopic compositions of stream water along with the shallow landslide area/ catchment area ratio (LCR) in 37 headwater subcatchments in the southern part of Hokkaido, Japan, where an earthquake caused more than 6000 shallow landslides on September 6, 2018. In subcatchments with a high LCR, stream water exhibited significantly higher Ca2+ and HCO3- concentrations, while there was no correlation between the LCR and concentrations of Na+ and Cl-. The 818O and 8D values of stream water plotted between the local meteoric water lines of summer and winter precipitation, indicating that they originated from meteoric water. Shallow landslides formed sliding surfaces, landslide deposits, and landslide-dammed lakes, which enhanced the interaction between the surface soil and stream water, leading to Ca-HCO3 type water. The results showed that shallow-landslide driven changes in stream water quality could be linearly approximated by the fraction of the landslide area at the catchment scale, which is a more versatile approach than the local framework of a single landslide and a nearby stream. In future research, these findings could be combined with a slope stability model and the background climatic, geological, topographical, and water quality conditions of a watershed to evaluate water pollution triggered by shallow landslides at the catchment scale.

The results are compared with proxy data from the interior Loess Plateau, to help reconstruct atmospheric circulation during Late Pleistocene times. Middle to Late Pleistocene alluvial terraces and fans, capped with loess units and paleosols, show that aggradational episodes correlate with periods of glaciation and increased loess accumulation. In turn, degradation correlates with interglacials or interstadials and increased soil formation. This implies that climate is the primary control on Quaternary paleohydrology and alluvial sedimentation and erosion. The high mountains, which barely reached the last glacial ELA, were only glaciated during the most favourable climatic period of glaciation. The glaciation, the glacial and alluvial forms point to a cool early to maximum glacial period with increased precipitation and to a maximum to final period with cold-dry conditions. During the last glaciation, the maximum advance of the small glaciers took place towards the end of a relatively humid and cold period bt:tween ca. 32 and 23 ka. The following dry-cold stage between ca. 23 and 13 ka was rather unfavourable for glacial advance. Proxy data from the Loess Plateau supports the view, that glaciations were more or less dominated by cold-dry winter monsoon climate, whereas during the interglacial/interstadials a warmer and more humid climate prevailed, implying a strengthening of the summer monsoon influence. The results prove variations of the monsoon, that in turn modulates paleohydrology, periglacial dynamics, glacier advances, dust flux and soil formation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA.

More precisely, it examines the socioecological relationships between Finns and lakes, rivers, and marshesmires. First, the 'engine' of endemic timespace research, land use, and occupancy documentation, is explored in the Finnish context. Then two catchment areas, Kokemaenjoki in Western Finland and Vuoksi in Eastern Finland, provide cases which illustrate both past endemic timespaces and surviving aspects of cultural readings of lakes and rivers. The ongoing winter seining in Lake Puruvesi in North Karelia emerges as an unbroken practice, with deep roots, that maintains the endemic timespaces of a traditional Finnish relationship with a lake. As industrial uses of catchment areas, zoning, and environmental permitting exclude endemic readings inherent on the land and waterscapes, solutions are explored through mapping, along with its limitations, as a form bridging the gap between local realities and resource extraction.																			0015-0010	1798-5617					2014	192	2					120	139		10.11143/40845	http://dx.doi.org/10.11143/40845													WOS:000216646900004

Vegetation, climate and lake changes over the last 7000 years at the boreal treeline in north-central Siberia	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS					2nd International Conference of the Palaeo-Arctic-Spatial-and-Temporal-Gateways-Network (PAST Gateways)	2014	Trieste, ITALY	Palaeo Arctic Spatial & Temporal Gateways Network				Palaeoecological investigations in the larch forest-tundra ecotone in northern Siberia have the potential to reveal Holocene environmental variations, which likely have consequences for global climate change because of the strong high-latitude feedback mechanisms. A sediment core, collected from a small lake (radius similar to 100 m), was used to reconstruct the development of the lake and its catchment as well as vegetation and summer temperatures over the last 7100 calibrated years. A multi-proxy approach was taken including pollen and sedimentological analyses. Our data indicate a gradual replacement of open larch forests by tundra with scattered single trees as found today in the vicinity of the lake. An overall trend of cooling summer temperature from a similar to 2 degrees C warmer-than-present mid-Holocene summer temperatures until the establishment of modern conditions around 3000 years ago is reconstructed based on a regional pollen-climate transfer function. The inference of regional vegetation changes was compared to local changes in the lake's catchment. An initial small water depression occurred from 7100 to 6500 cal years BP. Afterwards, a small lake formed and deepened, probably due to thermokarst processes. Although the general trends of local and regional environmental change match, the lake catchment changes show higher variability. Furthermore, changes in the lake catchment slightly precede those in the regional vegetation. Both proxies highlight that marked environmental changes occurred in the Siberian forest-tundra ecotone over the course of the Holocene. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The population of three-lips in Lake Biwa has decreased, primarily due to habitat degradation and introduction by competitive, non-native predators, such as largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). However, the effects of bass introduction on the three-lips are unclear. We investigated the food habits of the three-lips and compared them with those of sympatric non-native largemouth bass in Lake Biwa. A total of 145 three-lips and 178 largemouth bass were sampled during the summer and fall of 2013. Fish prey, particularly ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis), was predominant in the three-lips diet, followed by terrestrial insects. Decapods (i.e., prawn and shrimp), ayu and demersal fish (e.g., gobids) composed a substantial proportion of bass diets. No significant dietary overlaps were found between the two predators. Our results suggest that differences in food habits between the two species may result from differences in feeding behavior; the three-lips is a mobile predator that forages mainly on nektonic and suspended food, whereas largemouth bass is an ambush predator that forages on both nektonic and benthic prey. We referred the results of three-lips diets in Lake Biwa in a previous study and suggest that changes in fish fauna, due to introduction by non-native largemouth bass, may have affected prey availability for the three-lips.					; Tsunoda, Hiroshi/L-2974-2019	Tsunoda, Hiroshi/0000-0001-6214-5625; 													0003-4088	2100-000X					2015	51	3					273	280		10.1051/limn/2015021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2015021													WOS:000366177800009

The Role of the SO2 Radiative Effect in Sustaining the Volcanic Winter and Soothing the Toba Impact on Climate	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Volcanic eruptions are an important climate driver. The impact of Pinatubo-sized eruptions has been observed and is well constrained. The magnitude and duration of volcanic winter effects after supereruptions such as Toba remain disputed due to disagreement between the strong cooling predicted by models and much milder climate perturbations according to the paleodata. Here we present a reevaluated climate impact of a Toba-sized supereruption based on up-to-date GISS ModelE simulations. In this study, we account for all known primary mechanisms that govern the evolution of the volcanic plume and their nonlinear interactions. The SO2 radiative effects are evaluated for the first time in coupled climate simulations with the interactive atmospheric chemistry module. We found that SO2 effects on photochemistry, dynamics, and radiative forcing are especially prominent. Due to strong absorption in ultraviolet, SO2 feedback on photochemistry partially offsets the limiting effect associated with aerosol microphysical processes. SO2 greenhouse warming soothes the radiative cooling exerted by sulfate aerosols. SO2 absorption in the shortwave and longwave causes radiative heating and lofting of the volcanic plume, and boosts the efficiency of SO2 impact on photochemistry. Our analysis shows that SO2 lifetime and magnitude of effects scale up and increase with the amount of emitted material. For a Pinatubo-sized eruption, SO2 feedbacks on chemistry and dynamics are relevant only during the initial stage of the volcanic plume evolution, while local SO2 concentrations are high. For a Toba-sized eruption, SO2 effects are as important as sulfate aerosols and produce a less extreme volcanic winter.

SPRING PELAGIC COMMUNITIES OF PHYTOPLANKTON, CYANOBACTERIA, ASSOCIATED HETEROTROPHIC BACTERIA AND VIRUSES IN A EUTROPHIC SHALLOW TEMPERATE LAKE	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												The high viral counts reported in aquatic systems suggest that viral infection may be an important factor controlling bacterial and phytoplankton populations in natural waters. In order to test the importance of viruses on bacterial and phytoplankton dynamics, we have taken advantage of the spring phytoplankton bloom, which occurs regularly in the shallow freshwater Vela Lake. Viral particles were counted by epifluorescence microscopy after staining with SYBR gold. Phytoplankton composition, viral and bacterial densities were determined every second day between April and June of 2006 in surface water samples (32 samples). The concentration of viruses through the spring bloom decrease from 1,27x109 viruses mL(-1) after the Chlorophyta bloom to 5,40x10(7) viruses mL(-1) during the peak of Cyanobacteria, with a mean of 2,70x10(8) viruses mL(-1). Bacterial numbers followed the same pattern of variation, decreasing during the bloom from 3.33x10(8) cells mL(-1) to 1.01x10(8) cells L-1 with a mean of 1.64x10(8) cells L-1. Although viruses counts were, on average, higher than bacterial counts, yielding mean virus-to-bacterium ratio of 1.6 (range 0.3 to 7.2), the virus-to-bacterium ratio was frequently low, showing values below 1 in 43 % of the cases. The same pattern of variation of viruses and bacteria during the phytoplankton bloom as well as the significant correlation between viruses and bacteria (p<0.05) suggest that a significant fraction of viruses are bacteriophages. By considering not only the environmental parameters, bacteria and phytoplankton but also viruses as explanatory variable in a canonical correspondence analysis, the variance explained during the study period was increased in about 3% achieving a total of 67.3%, indicating a correlation that may be due to the known regulation of the ecosystem by viruses.

L02403	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												[1] Annually laminated (varved) sediments from Sanagak Lake in the Canadian middle Arctic were used to reconstruct past spring discharge. Two years of sediment transport observations demonstrate that sediment delivery in this nival regime is limited primarily to the short period of maximum discharge. Interannual variability in catchment snow water equivalence (SWE) was the primary control over the length of the peak discharge period, resulting in substantially increased sediment transport and deposition in the lake in years with higher SWE. Analysis of annual sediment accumulation reveals high interannual variability with a persistent 64-80 year frequency as well as a prominent decline, particularly since 1820 AD. These spectral results suggest a linkage between the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and snowfall conditions through persistence of the characteristic frequency since 1550 AD.

Isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in high mountain lakes: variation with altitude in the Pyrenees	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Nitrogen deposition in remote areas has increased, but the effect on ecosystems is still poorly understood. For aquatic systems, knowledge of the main processes driving the observed variation is limited, as is knowledge of how changes in nitrogen supply affect lake biogeochemical and food web processes. Differences in dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) between lakes cannot be understood without considering catchment characteristics. In mountains, catchment features (e.g., thermal conditions, land cover) vary considerably with elevation. The isotopic composition of nitrogen (delta N-15) is increasingly used to study aquatic ecosystem dynamics. Here we explore the variability of delta N-15 in DIN in high mountain lakes and show that environmental conditions that change with altitude can affect the isotopic ratio. We measured ammonium and nitrate delta N-15 values in atmospheric deposition, epilimnetic water, deep chlorophyll maximum water (DCMW) and sediment pore water (SPW) from eight mountain lakes in the Pyrenees, both above and below the treeline. Lakes showed relatively uniform delta N-15-NH4+ values in SPW (2.2 +/- 1.6 parts per thousand), with no variation corresponding to catchment or lake characteristics. We suggest that organic matter diagenesis under similar sediment conditions is responsible for the low variation between the lakes. In the water column, the range of delta N-15 values was larger for ammonium (-9.4 parts per thousand to 7.4 parts per thousand) than for nitrate (-11.4 parts per thousand to -3.4 parts per thousand), as a result of higher variation both between and within lakes (epilimnetic vs. DCM water). For both compounds part of the difference correlated with altitude or catchment features (e.g., scree proportion). Based on concentration, chemical and isotopic tendencies, we suggest that patterns arise from the distinct relative contributions of two types of water flow paths to the lakes: one from snowpack melting, with little soil interaction; and another highly influenced by soil conditions. The snow-type flow path contributes low DIN concentrations depleted in N-15, whereas the soil-type flow path contributes high nitrate concentrations with higher delta N-15. The proportion of these two types of source correlates with average catchment features when there is extensive snow cover during spring and early summer and probably becomes more dependent on local characteristics around the lake as summer advances. Lake depth and pore water ammonium concentrations, among other features, introduce secondary variation. In the context of nitrogen deposition studies, lakes with higher snow-type influence will probably register changes in N deposition and pollution sources better, whereas lakes with higher soil-type influence may reflect long-term effects of vegetation and soil dynamics.

J	Cao, ZH; Zhang, HC				Cao, ZH; Zhang, HC			Phosphorus losses to water from lowland rice fields under rice-wheat double cropping system in the Tai Lake region	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH												To assess P losses to surface water by runoff during the rice season and by drainage flow during the winter wheat season, serial field trials were conducted in different types of paddy soils in the Tai Lake Region (TLR) during 2000 and 2001. Four P application rates were set as 0 (CK), 30, 150, and 300 kg P/hm(2) for flooded rice trials and 0 (CK), 20, 80, 160 kg P/hm(2) for winter wheat trials respectively. Field experiments were done in two locations with a plot size of 30 m(2) and four replications in a randomized complete block design. A simplified lysimeter was installed for each plot to collect all the runoff or drainage flow from each event. Total P (TP) losses to surface water during rice season by runoff flow from four treatments were 150 (CK), 220 (T30), 395 (T150), 670 (T300) g P/hm(2) in year 2000, and 298, 440, 1828, 3744 g P/hm(2) in year 2001 respectively in Wuxi station, here the soil is permeable paddy soil derived from loam clay deposit. While the losses were 102, 140, 210, 270 in year 2000, and 128, 165, 359, 589 g P/hm(2) in year 2001 respectively in Changshu station, here the soil is waterlogged paddy soil derived from silt loam deposit. During the winter wheat season, total P lost from the fields by drainage flow in the four treatments were 253 (CK), 382 (T20), 580 (T89), 818 (T160) g P/hm(2) in year 2000-2001, and 573.3, 709.4, 1123.2, 1552.4 g P/hm(2) in year 2001-2002 at the Wuxi station. While these were 395.6, 539.1, 1356.8, 1972.1 g P/hm(2) in year 2000-2001, and 811.5, 1184.6, 3001.2, 5333.1 g P/hm(2) in year 2001-2002 at the Changshu station. Results revealed that P fertilizer application rates significantly affected the TP concentrations and TP loads in runoff during the rice season, and by drainage flow during the winter wheat season. Both TP loads were significantly increased as the P application rate increases. The data indicate that TP losses to surface water were much higher during the winter wheat season than during the rice season in two tested sites. The data also reveal that the annual precipitation and evaporation rate affected the soil P losses to surface water significantly. Year 2000 was relatively dried with higher evaporation thus P losses to water by both runoff and drainage flow were less than in year 2001 which was a relatively wet year with lower evaporation. Results indicate that texture, structure of the soil pro. le, and field construction (with or without ridge and deep drains) affected soil P losses to surface water dramatically. Annual possible TP lost to water at the application rate of 50 kg P/hm(2) year tested in TLR were estimated from 97 to 185 tones P from permeable paddy soils and 109-218 tones P from waterlogged paddy soils. There was no signi. cant difference of TP lost between the CK and the T50 treatments in both stations, which indicate that there is no more TP lost in field of normal P fertilizer application rate than in control field of no P fertilized. Much higher TP lost in runoff or drainage flow from those other P application rates treatments than from the T50 treatment, which suggest that P losses to surface water would be greatly increasing in the time when higher available P accumulation in plough layer soil in this region.																			0269-4042	1573-2983				JUN-SEP	2004	26	2-3					229	236		10.1023/B:EGAH.0000039585.24651.f8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:EGAH.0000039585.24651.f8								15499778					WOS:000223553200015

Owing to the stratigraphic structure, high tectonic activity, and changeable climate of the region, the recharge source, runoff path, and dynamic characteristics of karst groundwater are highly complex, which poses challenges with regard to the protection of water resources and ecology. This study identified the origin and flow processes of karst groundwater in the glacial lake area of the Jinsha River fault zone using satellite remote sensing, hydrochemical and isotope analyses, and flow measurements. Results showed that active faults control the distribution of glacial lakes and the recharge, runoff, and discharge of karst groundwater. Glacial lake water is an important source of karst groundwater in the Jinsha River fault zone area. Specifically, glacial lake water continuously recharges the karst system via faults, fractures, and karst conduits, thereby maintaining the relative stability of karst spring flows. Through hierarchical cluster analysis, two main runoff conduits of karst water were distinguished: one along the Dingqu Fault and the other along the Eastern Zhairulong Fault, which together account for 59% of the total regional karst groundwater flow. The elevation difference between the recharge and discharge areas of the main karst springs is > 1000 m. Groundwater runoff is fast and residence time in the aquifer is short. The dissolution of calcite and dolomite mainly occurs during transit through the groundwater system, and cation exchange is weak. Therefore, the regional karst springs are predominantly HCO3-Ca center dot Mg type. To protect regional karst water resources and ecology, the monitoring and protection of glacial lakes should be strengthened.

J	Wang, D; Huo, ZL; Miao, P; Tian, XQ				Wang, Di; Huo, Zailin; Miao, Ping; Tian, Xiaoqiang			Comparison of Machine Learning Models to Predict Lake Area in an Arid Area	REMOTE SENSING												Machine learning (ML)-based models are popular for complex physical system simulation and prediction. Lake is the important indicator in arid and semi-arid areas, and to achieve the proper management of the water resources in a lake basin, it is crucial to estimate and predict the lake dynamics, based on hydro-meteorological variations and anthropogenic disturbances. This task is particularly challenging in arid and semi-arid regions, where water scarcity poses a significant threat to human life. In this study, a typical arid area of China was selected as the study area, and the performances of eight widely used ML models (i.e., Bayesian Ridge (BR), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Extra Trees (ET), Random Forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AB), Bootstrap aggregating (Bagging), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)) were evaluated in predicting lake area. Monthly lake area was determined by meteorological (precipitation, air temperature, Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)) and anthropogenic factors (ETc, NDVI, LUCC). Lake area determined by Landsat satellite image classification for 2000-2020 was analysed side-by-side with the Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) on 9 and 12-month time scales. With the evaluation of six input variables and eight ML algorithms, it was found that the RF models performed best when using the SPEI-9 index, with R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 1.37, LCCC = 0.95, and PRD = 1331.4 for the test samples. Furthermore, the performance of the ML model constructed with the 9-month time scale SPEI (SPEI-9) as an input variable (MLSPEI-9) depended on seasonal variations, with the average relative errors of up to 0.62 in spring and a minimum of 0.12 in summer. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of different ML models for predicting lake area by demonstrating that the right inputs can lead to a remarkable increase in performance of up to 13.89%. These findings have important implications for future research on lake area prediction in arid zones and demonstrate the power of ML models in advancing scientific understanding of complex natural systems.																				2072-4292				SEP	2023	15	17							4153	10.3390/rs15174153	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15174153													WOS:001061263600001

The study on SCCPs in Antarctica biota, however, are extremely limited, especially during the winter. In this study, we therefore for the first time examined SCCPs in two fish species, mackerel icefish Champsocephalus gunnari and painted notie Nototheniops larseni, with different life-history patterns but of both ecological importance at South Georgia during austral winter. No significant difference was observed in the SCCPs concentrations measured by dry weight (dw), which were 280.73 +/- 61.55 ng/g dw for C. gunnari and 280.06 +/- 61.78 ng/g dw for N. larseni, while the SCCPs concentrations by lipid weight showed significant interspecific difference. The chain length of SCCPs was closely related to their concentrations in Antarctic biota, with an overall tendency of higher levels with shorter chain lengths. The C10 congeners of C. gunnari were significantly higher than the others.

However, the extent of HMs accumulation in the Bhairab River and its potential risk still remain unknown. The current study quantified HMs in water, sediment, and different fish species of Bhairab River to evaluate the ecological and human health risk. Water, sediment, and fish samples were collected during two seasons (monsoon and winter) from three locations and measured for HMs (Pb, Cd, Cr, Fe, Mn, Zn) using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer (F-AAS, Model: Shimadzu AA-7000, Japan). HMs in water and sediment were found in the order of Cd < Pb < Cr < Zn < Mn < Fe. The Fe, Mn, and Zn exceeded the threshold limit for drinking standard as per WHO (2004) and USEPA (1999). The contamination factor and geo-accumulation index were < 1, indicating that river bank sediment is suitable for crop cultivation during winter. HMs in water, sediment, and fish were lower during the monsoon compared to winter, due to dilution effects. According to WHO (2004), FAO (1983), and MOFL (2014), HMs in fish did not exceed the tolerable limit except for Cr. According to WHO (2004) guidlines, the daily intake of HMs was less than reference dose. For non-carcinogenic risk, THQ and HI < 1, indicating no potential health risk for Khulna urban inhabitants due to consumption of the studied fish. Cr posed a potential carcinogenic risk from lifelong consumption of these fish. These findings may support national policy-making and riverine ecosystem management in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).					Siddik, Md.

However, changes in monsoon vapor transport and the westerly jet stream, as well as their effect to climate change mode there, are not clear at different time scales. Here we present composite research using paleoclimate reconstructions and ensemble simulations since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) on the basis of an eolian sedimentary sequence in the northern QTP. Results from 317 surface sediment samples show that pedogenic carbonate delta O-18 is affected both by precipitation and temperature, and organic carbon isotope (delta C-1(3)org) reflects the vegetation growth status in areas where precipitation is greater than 290 mm. Proxies from the sedimentary sequence and the Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project 3 (PMIP3) simulations show a close relationship between climate change mode in the northern QTP and the westerly jet stream whose movement is triggered by warm or cold conditions in the high-latitude regions. That is, when the climate is in cold/glacial period the westerly jet stream strengthens and moves southward, and the mountains become wetter. This climate change mode can be validated by records from mountains of North America and Africa. According to the CMIP5 simulations, the westerly jet stream will strengthen in the future, and climate in the northern QTP and the high-altitude region of the mid-latitudes will become wetter with global warming.

Planktonic/total (benthic and planktonic) foraminiferal ratio decreased abruptly during 4.6-3.3 ka, and Nonionella stella was found commonly across -4 ka in core ND-01 (intermediate site among the five cores). These results imply that the -4 ka climatic event led to the stratification of less saline epilimnetic water underlain by more saline oxygen-poor hypolimnetic water in the Nakdong River Delta. This indicates temporal increase in precipitation in the Nakdong River drainage, which can be attributed to the intensified rainfall with the second Changma peak, associated with typhoons toward the Korean Peninsula. The small twin maxima of N. stella across -4 ka in core ND-01 were similar to those of the total sulfur contents in both Yeja Bay (southern Korea) and Lake Togo-ike (southwestern Japan). Such similarity in the stratigraphic patterns among the remote locations can be explained by the small-scale sea-level variations with the fluctuation of the Tsushima Warm Current, in addition to changes in precipitation. The common species of Haynesina sp. A was replaced by Elphidium somaense after -4.6 ka, which is likely due to the shift of passive dispersal as a result of the enhanced East Asian winter monsoon and/or the change in the westerly jet path.

Alpine catena response to nitrogen deposition and its effect on the aquatic system	CATENA												Alpine areas are vulnerable to nitrogen (N) deposition because of low N-buffering capacity and limited ability to resist change. The objective of the study was to assess if > 30 years of N deposition have resulted in a decline in exchangeable base cations (C-B) coupled with an increase of exchangeable aluminum (Al). We used soil and stream data sampled between 1982 and 2015 at Green Lakes Valley, Colorado Front Range to evaluate the change in an alpine catena. The C-B in the surface horizons of the summit position decreased significantly from 45 cmol(c) kg(-1) in 1982 to 2.3 cmol(c) kg(-1) in 2015, while the exchangeable Al increased from 0.09 cmol(c) kg(-1) to 0.7 cmol(c) kg(-1) in the summit and from 8.9 cmol(c) kg(-1) to 10.5 cmol(c) kg(-1) in the toeslope. Spatiotemporal distribution of soil moisture along the catena exhibited the lowest values during the winter months because the temperature was below freezing. The soil moisture increased in early spring as soil-temperature rose. A Seasonal Kendall test (SK) showed that the soil moisture decreased along the catena by -0.007 m(3) m(-3) yr(-1) (P < 0.001). The soil moisture trend coincided with a soil temperature increase from the summit to toeslope of 0.68 degrees yr(-1). Segmental SK analysis of acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC) measured in the outlet of the lake below the catena showed a decrease of -2.15 mu eq L-1 yr(-1) for the first monitoring period from 1982 to 1995, and an increase by 0.51 mu eq L-1 yr(-1) during the second monitoring period from 1995 to 2014. These trend analyses attest to the limited influence of the alpine soil system on the overall aquatic chemistry. Hence, a clear distinction should be made between the alpine soils and the terrestrial system (e.g., rock glacier, taluses, and screes). Most of the soils have little impact on the aquatic system, whereas other terrestrial features are more important in this regard.

Sharp-tailed Grouse increase site use after prescribed fire but not mechanical treatments during the fall	AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY												In the Great Lakes Region, Sharp-tailed Grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus) use open habitats of grass and brush that require frequent management. Wildlife managers expressed concern that Sharp-tailed Grouse were not responding to management throughout the year, so we examined responses to prescribed fire and mechanical treatment (mowing or shearing) conducted during the fall. We surveyed Sharp-tailed Grouse use and vegetation at 15 mechanical treatments, 10 prescribed burns, and 25 control sites in a before-after-control-impact-paired design. We surveyed Sharp-tailed Grouse use before management, and one week, one month, one year, and three years after management by conducting fecal pellet surveys along transects at each site. Sharp-tailed Grouse responses, as indicated by differences between fecal pellet counts at treatments and paired controls during each survey, increased following prescribed fire, but did not change after mechanical treatments. However, increased Sharp-tailed Grouse use following prescribed fire was temporary, thus management should be conducted at least once every three years at each site. Changes in vegetation metrics at managed sites were also temporary and most metrics returned to pre-treatment levels after one year, although shrub height at sites that received mechanical treatments and the forb response following prescribed fire persisted for > 3 years. We suggest that fall prescribed fire is more effective at increasing Sharp-tailed Grouse use of sites than fall mechanical treatment, which could be due to differences in vegetation responses, site size, landscape context, or cues produced by fire that attract Sharp-tailed Grouse. However, mechanical treatments maintain Sharp-tailed Grouse habitat, and without management, unchecked woody encroachment reduces habitat. Targeting mowing and shearing at sites known to be used by Sharp-tailed Grouse may prioritize management activities to sites that will have the most impact. Prescribed fire and mechanical treatments produced different Sharp-tailed Grouse and vegetation responses in the fall and should be used to address different management objectives.																			1712-6568					JAN	2024	19	1							1	10.5751/ACE-02574-190101	http://dx.doi.org/10.5751/ACE-02574-190101													WOS:001145984600001

ANIMALS												Simple Summary Intestinal microbes play an indispensable role in host physiology and their alteration can produce serious effects on vertebrates. In this study, we analyzed the characteristics of intestinal bacterial community of hooded crane and bean goose whose niches overlap at Shengjin Lake, China, and investigated how host internal factors and inter-species interactions affected the diversity and spread of intestinal bacteria of the two species over three wintering periods. We have found that direct or indirect contact with each other increased the diversity of host intestinal bacteria and caused bacteria to spread among species in the mixed-species flock. In addition, a total of 63 pathogens were identified, of which 38 (60.3%) were found in the gut of both species. These findings could help our understanding of the factors that influence gut bacteria in wild waterbirds, which are also major contributors to the spread of pathogens worldwide. Diversity of gut microbes is influenced by many aspects, including the host internal factors and even direct or indirect contact with other birds, which is particularly important for mixed-species wintering waterbird flocks. In this study, Illumina high-throughput sequencing was used to analyze the intestinal bacteria of the hooded crane and bean goose whose niches overlap at Shengjin Lake. We tested whether contact time enhances the trans-species spread of gut bacteria. Results indicate alpha-diversity and microbial composition displayed significant separation between the two hosts in every wintering period, although the number of bacteria types shared increased with increasing contact time. For the same species, with the lengthening of contact time, alpha-diversity and the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the host intestine augmented, and the common OTUs and structural similarity of microflora in the middle and late periods were more than in the early and middle periods. In addition, we found a very high proportion of shared pathogens. Our results indicate that, although intestinal microflora of different species were separated, direct or indirect contact in the mixed-species flock caused the spread of gut bacteria trans-species, indicating that more attention should be paid to intestinal pathogens in wild birds.

J	Pyrovetsi, M; Papazahariadou, M				Pyrovetsi, M; Papazahariadou, M			Mortality factors of dalmatian pelicans (Pelecanus crispus) wintering in Macedonia, Greece	ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION												A survey of dead Dalmatian Pelicans (Pelecanus crispus) at Kerkini Lake, Greece, the major wintering site in Europe of this world-endangered species, was undertaken to investigate the causes of high mortality that occurred during 1991-93. In February 1991, 30% of the population wintering on the Lake (30 individuals) were found dead, the majority (85%) having died of natural causes. A loss of this magnitude does not reflect only locally or on the genetic stock of the species but is also a matter of grave concern relative to its conservation world-wide. Most mortality of the Pelicans coincided with subzero temperatures and the Lake freezing over - conditions that direct fish to deep waters, and make them unavailable to the Pelicans. Necropsies were carried out on the carcasses of 13 Pelicans, including stomach and gizzard, etc., contents' analysis, and gross pathological, bacteriological, toxicological, and parasitological, examinations. All the carcasses found at Lake Kerkini were dehydrated and emaciated. No food was found in the digestive system of the Pelicans, but there was a heavy parasite burden. Species of seven helminth genera were detected in the carcasses, three of them (Bolbophorus, Contracaecum, and Synhimantus) being reported for the first time in Greece. Contracaecum spp. in large numbers (up to 875 worms per bird), were found in the digestive system of all the carcasses. Most parasites were observed to penetrate the wall of the gizzard, causing haemorrhages and ulcers. No evidence of chlorinated hydrocarbon contamination or bacterial infection was found. Mycotic lesions were detected in the air-sacs of one Dalmatian Pelican, which may have contributed to the death of that particular individual in connection with the parasite burden. In conclusion, it is suggested that the mortality of Dalmatian Pelicans in the wintering ground has been the result of prolonged harsh weather conditions with subzero temperatures, which drastically limited the availability of food supplies, in concert with a heavy parasite burden of their digestive system. The ulcers of the Pelicans' stomachs caused by parasites, further deteriorated the physical condition of the birds, contributing to their death. It is recommended that management practices should consider providing fish to Pelicans during harsh winter conditions in order to help the birds to overcome the combined pressure of stomach parasites and lack of food.																			0376-8929	1469-4387				WIN	1995	22	4					345	351		10.1017/S0376892900034913	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0376892900034913													WOS:A1995UG62700010

In shallow eutrophic lakes, the contributions of algae and suspended sediments to light attenuation are usually dominant. Wind induced resuspension of bottom sediment and sedimentation often determine the dynamics and the spatial variability of the suspended solids concentration and the light attenuation coefficient. A model is discussed relating the suspended solids concentration and light attenuation coefficient to the orbital velocity, induced by waves, and to the fall velocity of solids. Using experimental data, the relationships between fall velocity, organic matter content and the specific vertical attenuation coefficient are analyzed, Differences in the specific vertical attenuation coefficient and in fall velocities of sediment fractions, are related to differences in particle size as well as differences in composition. The contribution of (resuspended) particles to the suspended solids concentration and to light attenuation is primarily due to slow settling sediment fractions which are rich in organic matter. So in modelling light attenuation dynamics especially these fractions are of interest. Heavier fractions can be disregarded. A model for the relationship between resuspension and light attenuation dynamics, based on this conclusion, has been tested successfully for 2 shallow Dutch lakes.																			0273-1223						1994	30	10					243	252		10.2166/wst.1994.0534	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.1994.0534													WOS:A1994QP63100031

To investigate the influence of proglacial lake formation on the dynamics and evolution of glaciers, we measured horizontal flow velocity, vertical ice motion and water levels in boreholes with high spatial resolutions during the summer seasons of 2007-09. Annual flow speeds near the terminus increased by a factor of 2.7 from 2005/06 to 2007/08, and exceeded 20 m a(-1) in 2009. The velocity increased towards the glacier front, indicating that the ice was thinning under a longitudinally stretching flow regime. Our observations show that the increase in flow speed near the terminus was due to increases in basal motion as a result of ice thinning. During summer 2009, the ice surface at the terminus moved vertically upwards by up to 4.69 m as the ice began to float on the lake. The observed ice motion can be explained by the upward bending of marginal ice and the formation of faults that cut through the entire ice thickness. We predict that if the current ice thinning continues, the basal water pressure will exceed the pressure exerted by the ice overburden, and the glacier will progressively disintegrate over an expanding area.					; Tsutaki, Shun/AAQ-4678-2021; Sugiyama, Shin/C-2511-2012	Tsutaki, Shun/0000-0002-5716-225X; 													0022-1430	1727-5652					2013	59	215					559	570		10.3189/2013JoG12J107	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/2013JoG12J107													WOS:000323189600015

Subsequent surveys found it in six U.S. states and in one Canadian province. The first natural area where Tomicus was found to be established was at the Indiana Dunes State Park, in northwestern Indiana near the Lake Michigan shoreline. Pine stands were surveyed for fallen shoots to determine the extent and range of shoot feeding in the park. Within the study area adult Tomicus fed on the shoots of all native pines (Pinus banksiana, P. resinosa, and P. strobus.) as well as the European species (P. sylvestris). More fallen shoots were collected from both P. resinosa and P. sylvestris than expected from their basal areas in the sampled stands. This contrasted with P. banksiana and P. strobus whose shoots were underrepresented relative to their basal areas. The relatively high numbers of fallen shoots found for P. resinosa suggests that red pines in the Great Lakes region will easily support populations of ir: piniperda.																			0090-0222					WIN	1995	27	4					223	228																WOS:A1995QX07400006
J	Bertani, I; Primicerio, R; Rossetti, G				Bertani, Isabella; Primicerio, Raul; Rossetti, Giampaolo			Extreme Climatic Event Triggers a Lake Regime Shift that Propagates Across Multiple Trophic Levels	ECOSYSTEMS												Extreme climatic events, such as heatwaves and droughts, are occurring more frequently in many regions of the world. Lakes may be especially vulnerable to climatic perturbations, which can trigger sudden ecosystem changes through alterations in the hydrologic regime. However, the nature of lake response to climatic extremes, and associated longterm ecosystem-level implications are difficult to predict, due to the paucity of time series allowing exploration of ecosystem behavior before, during, and after extreme events. We investigated the impacts of the 2003 European heatwave on a small, stratifying lake by analyzing available limnological data between 1986 and 2012. In summer 2003, a shift from an unvegetated to a macrophyte-dominated regime occurred, due to the rapid spread of a benthic charophyte. We explored candidate mechanisms driving the shift by comparing empirical observations with the outcome of a model on lake alternative states parameterized for our study lake. Our results support the hypothesis that enhanced light availability due to a heatwave-induced decrease in water level drove the switch in dominant primary producers. The spread of the charophyte was associated with strong depletion of inorganic nutrients and suppression of the typical summer phytoplankton peak. These bottom-up interactions triggered cascading effects at higher trophic levels, inducing a decline in herbivorous zooplankters with high food requirements and in predatory taxa. Some of the changes in the lake food web persist through the available time series. If incidence of heatwaves increases, as projected across temperate regions, our findings suggest that abrupt and long-lasting ecosystem-level reorganizations may occur in small, stratifying lakes.

J	Kluver, D; Leathers, D				Kluver, Daria; Leathers, Daniel			Winter snowfall prediction in the United States using multiple discriminant analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												This study seeks to determine the skill of multiple discriminant analysis for predicting seasonal snowfall. Winter total snowfall amount and frequency of snowfall events are examined for 440 stations in the United States from 1930 to 2006. The independent variables used to create the forecast include ocean-atmosphere teleconnection patterns [such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)], large-scale atmospheric patterns [such as the Arctic Oscillation (AO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Pacific/North American (PNA)], land cover (such as Arctic sea ice extent and Eurasian snow cover extent), and temperature. Based on a jackknife analysis, forecasts are correct 20-80% of the time for categories of 'below normal', 'near normal', and 'above normal'. When broader categories are used of 'normal or below', 'near normal', and 'normal or above' the forecasts are correct as much as 90% of the time at some stations. The Central United States, Ohio River Valley, Great Lakes, and Upper Midwest regions show the highest level of skill. Results not only confirm relationships previously documented between atmospheric phenomena and US snowfall (such as with the PNA, NAO, and ENSO), but also expand our understanding of factors that influence decadal-scale snowfall variation (such as Arctic sea ice extent and Eurasian snow cover extent).					; Leathers, Daniel/A-3665-2010	Leathers, Daniel/0000-0001-9002-9031; 													0899-8418	1097-0088				JUN 30	2015	35	8					2003	2018		10.1002/joc.4103	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.4103													WOS:000357737000024

Environmental controls on modern chironomid faunas from NW Iceland and implications for reconstructing climate change	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Reconstructing climate change quantitatively over millennial timescales is crucial for understanding the processes that affect the climate system. One of the best methods for producing high resolution, low error, quantitative summer air temperature reconstructions is through chironomid analyses. We analysed over 50 lakes from NW and W Iceland covering a range of environmental gradients in order to test whether the distribution of the Icelandic chironomid fauna was driven by summer temperature, or whether other environmental factors were more dominant. A range of analyses showed the main environmental controls on chironomid communities to be substrate (identified through loss-on-ignition and carbon content) and mean July air temperature, although other factors such as lake depth and lake area were also important. The nature of the Icelandic landscape, with numerous volcanic centres (many of which are covered by ice caps) that produce large quantities of ash, means that relative lake carbon content and summer air temperature do not co-vary, as they often do in other chironomid datasets within the Arctic as well as more temperate environments. As the chironomid-environment relationships are thus different in Iceland compared to other chironomid training sets, we suggest that using an Icelandic model is most appropriate for reconstructing past environmental change from fossil Icelandic datasets. Analogue matching of Icelandic fossil chironomid datasets with the Icelandic training set and another European chironomid training set support this assertion. Analyses of a range of chironomid-inferred temperature transfer functions suggest the best to be a two component WA-PLS model with r(jack)(2) = 0.66 and RMSEP = 1.095 degrees C. Using this model, chironomid-inferred temperature reconstructions of early Holocene Icelandic sequences show the magnitude of temperature change compared to contemporary temperatures to be similar to other NW European chironomid sequences, suggesting that the predictive power of the model is good.

J	Huber, V; Wagner, C; Gerten, D; Adrian, R				Huber, Veronika; Wagner, Carola; Gerten, Dieter; Adrian, Rita			To bloom or not to bloom: contrasting responses of cyanobacteria to recent heat waves explained by critical thresholds of abiotic drivers	OECOLOGIA												Past heat waves are considered harbingers of future climate change. In this study, we have evaluated the effects of two recent Central European summer heat waves (2003 and 2006) on cyanobacterial blooms in a eutrophic, shallow lake. While a bloom of cyanobacteria developed in 2006, consistent with our expectations, cyanobacterial biomass surprisingly remained at a record-low during the entire summer of 2003. Critical thresholds of abiotic drivers extracted from the long-term (1993-2007) data set of the studied lake using classification tree analysis (CTA) proved suitable to explain these observations. We found that cyanobacterial blooms were especially favoured in 2006 because thermal stratification was critically intense (Schmidt stability > 44 g cm cm(-2)) and long-lasting (> 3 weeks). Our results also suggest that some cyanobacterial species (Anabaena sp.) benefitted directly from the stable water column, whereas other species (Planktothrix sp.) took advantage of stratification-induced internal nutrient loading. In 2003, conditions were less favourable for cyanobacteria due to a spell of lower temperatures and stronger winds in mid-summer; as a result, the identified thresholds of thermal stratification were hardly ever reached. Overall, our study shows that extracting critical thresholds of environmental drivers from long-term records is a promising avenue for predicting ecosystem responses to future climate warming. Specifically, our results emphasize that not average temperature increase but changes in short-term meteorological variability will determine whether cyanobacteria will bloom more often in a warmer world.					; Gerten, Dieter/B-2975-2013; Wagner, Carola/B-4260-2009; Huber, Veronika/AAI-1638-2019	Huber, Veronika/0000-0001-9633-2752; Gerten, Dieter/0000-0002-6214-6991; 													0029-8549	1432-1939				MAY	2012	169	1					245	256		10.1007/s00442-011-2186-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-011-2186-7								22120704					WOS:000302817700023
J	Grigg, LD; Whitlock, C				Grigg, LD; Whitlock, C			Late-glacial vegetation end climate change in western Oregon	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Pollen records from two sites in western Oregon provide information on late-glacial variations in vegetation and climate and on the extent and character of Younger Dryas cooling in the Pacific Northwest. A subalpine forest was present at Little Lake, central Coast Range, between 15,700 and 14,850 cal yr B.P. A warm period between 14,850 and 14,500 cal yr B.P. is suggested by an increase in Pseudotsuga pollen and charcoal. The recurrence of subalpine forest at 14,500 cal yr B.P. implies a return to cool conditions. Another warming trend is evidenced by the reestablishment of Pseudotsuga forest at 14,250 cal yr B.P. Increased haploxylon Pinus pollen between 12,400 and 11,000 cal yr B.P. indicates cooler winters than before. After 11,000 cal yr B.P. warm dry conditions are implied by the expansion of Pseudotsuga. A subalpine parkland occupied Gordon Lake, western Cascade Range, until 14,500 cal yr B.P., when it was replaced during a warming trend by a montane forest. A rise in Pinus pollen from 12,800 to 11,000 cal yr B.P. suggests increased summer aridity. Pseudotsuga dominated the vegetation after 11,000 cal yr B.P. Other records from the Pacific Northwest show an expansion of Pinus from ca. 13,000 to 11,000 cal yr B.P. This expansion may be a response either to submillennial climate changes of Younger Dryas age or to millennial-scale climatic variations.

Analysis was based on calcareous diatomite collected from four outcrops within the depressions. The diatom flora consists of brackish and epiphytic taxa, such as Epithemia argus, with percentages of some freshwater and planktonic species, mainly Cyclotella distinguenda. Results provide evidence for two Holocene lacustrine episodes related to the African Humid Period. The first episode (Early to Middle Holocene) was characterized by abrupt development of shallow-water conditions, with extensive littoral zones and evaporative periods that coincided with high salt concentrations in warm, alkaline water (swampy conditions). A second episode (Middle to Late Holocene?), with brackish water and alkaline conditions, coincided with a decline in lake water level that is attributed to drier conditions. Our findings are consistent with those of other studies from the area and demonstrate similar environmental changes occurred after 9300 cal yr BP at sites within the region. The main drivers of the African Humid Period were the northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and expansion of summer monsoonal rains. Our study sites were located in the northern Sahara, where variations in the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) did not affect rainfall. Early and Middle Holocene climate fluctuations detected in this study may have been caused by intensification of winter precipitation in the south-central Mediterranean and its penetration southward.

For comparison, fish biliary benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) metabolites were also measured by HPLC/fluorescent detection (HPLC/F). Both methods showed that concentrations of biliary PAH metabolites of fish collected in polluted rivers were significantly higher than those collected from reference rivers. Concentrations of biliary metabolites of fish caught in the Black River were five to 20 times greater than those collected in Old Woman Creek by SFS and three to five times greater by HPLC/F. Fish from the Cuyahoga River had four to 24 times more biliary PAH metabolites than fish from Old Woman Creek, measured by SFS, and five to 10 times more, measured by HPLC/F. Brown bullhead from the Toussaint River had fewer PAH metabolites than fish from Old Woman Creek. Correlation analyses of the two sets of data obtained by SFS and HPLC/F showed significance by both Pearson's sample correlation and Spearman's rank correlation. This study indicates that pyrene-type metabolites determined by SFS can be used to estimate B[a]P-type metabolites in fish bile. SFS appears to be a highly sensitive method for detecting PAH metabolites and, because of its simplicity, a cost-efficient method for screening large numbers of samples for exposure to PAHs in fish.																			0730-7268	1552-8618				MAY	1994	13	5					707	715		10.1002/etc.5620130504	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620130504													WOS:A1994NH59100004

In Lake Michigan, the in-situ wave observations suitable for long-term analysis are limited to two offshore MetOcean buoys. Since this distribution is inadequate to fully represent spatial patterns of wave climate across the lake, a series of high-resolution SWAN model simulations were performed for the analysis of long-term wave climate change for the entirety of Lake Michigan from 1979 to 2020. Model results were validated against observations from two offshore buoys and 16 coastal buoys. Linear regression analysis of significant wave height (H-s) (mean, 90th percentile, and 99th percentile) across the entire lake using this 42-year simulation suggests that there is no simple linear trend of long-term changes of H-s for the majority (>90%) of the lake. To address the inadequacy of linear trend analysis used in previous studies, a 10-year trailing moving mean was applied to the H-s statistics to remove seasonal and annual variability, focusing on identifying long-term wave climate change. Model results reveal the regime shifts of H-s that correspond to long-term lake water level changes. Specifically, downward trends of H-s were found in the decade of 1990-2000; low H-s during 2000-2010 coincident with low lake levels; and upward trends of H-s were found during 2010-2020 along with rising water levels. The coherent pattern between the wave climate and the water level was hypothesized to result from changing storm frequency and intensity crossing the lake basin, which influences both waves (instantly through increased wind stress on the surface) and water levels (following, with a lag through precipitation and runoff). Hence, recent water level increases and wave growth were likely associated with increased storminess observed in the Great Lakes. With regional warming, the decrease in ice cover in Lake Michigan (particularly in the northernmost region of the lake) favored the wave growth in the winter due to increased surface wind stress, wind fetch, and wave transmission. Model simulations suggest that the basin-wide H-s can increase significantly during the winter season with projected regional warming and associated decreases in winter ice cover. The recent increases in wave height and water level, along with warming climate and ice reduction, may yield increasing coastal damages such as accelerating coastal erosion.

Additionally, nutrient enrichment experiments were conducted in Lake Ontario. Results from the photosynthesis-irradiance experiments suggested that phytoplankton communities in all the lakes can be either light limited or light saturated, as the threshold parameter (I-k) was similar to mean water column irradiances (mean (I) over bar(wc), ratio = 1.0). Growth-irradiance experiments also suggested the potential for light saturation; mean daily irradiance exceeded the threshold growth irradiance (I-k,I-g) in 95% of cases. Growth rates became light saturated at lower irradiances than photosynthetic rates. Evidence for a nutrient-light interaction in controlling in situ growth rates was also found in the nutrient enrichment experiments at incubation irradiances greater than or equal to (I) over bar(wc). Our results suggest that an interaction between nutrients and light is often controlling phytoplankton growth during spring mixing in the Great Lakes. The role of these nutrient-light interactions has increased in the past decade due to increased light availability in the lower lakes caused by phosphorus load reductions and the filtering activities of nonindigenous mussels.					; Lohrenz, Steven/AAC-9151-2019; Fahnenstiel, Gary/ABD-6133-2020	Lohrenz, Steven/0000-0003-3811-2975; 													0706-652X					SEP	2000	57	9					1901	1910		10.1139/cjfas-57-9-1901	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-57-9-1901													WOS:000089033700014

This was the first time the method has been used on a Phalacrocoracid species. DLW trials were carried out on 5 caged birds and on 5 free-ranging wild birds at Lake Chiemsee. The mean body mass of the captive birds (2079 g) was not significantly different from and that of wild birds (2122 g). There was no significant difference in the total body water (TBW) of the two Cormorant groups (55.9% in captive birds and 56.7% in free-ranging birds). Estimated DEE (+/- SD) averaged 1325 +/- 130 kJ day(-1) (n = 5) in the caged birds and 2094 +/- 174 kJ day(-1) (n = 5) in the free-ranging ones, a highly signficant difference. To match their DEE, it was calculated that the Cormorants had to consume 341 g of fish per day under aviary conditions and 539 g in the wild.																			0373-2266						1999	87	1					61	69																WOS:000083232300006

Contribution of the deep chlorophyll maximum to primary production, phytoplankton assemblages and diversity in a small stratified lake	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												This 6-month study characterized the contribution of deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) to lake phytoplankton diversity and primary production, in relation to stratification during the ice-free season. Phytoplankton and zooplankton dynamics were examined with environmental drivers in a small stratified lake that presents vertical gradients of light and nutrients. The phytoplankton, first composed of diatoms and chrysophyceae, shifted to cyanobacteria in mid-July. With stratification increase, surface nutrient limitation appeared to favor motile species characteristic of oligotrophic environments above a deep layer of filamentous cyanobacteria, fueled by the vertical nutrient fluxes from sediment. The DCM contributed on average to 33% (but up to 60%) of total production during the strongest summer stratification period. In late summer, as stratification was eroding, the vertical gradient of nutrients was reduced, but light attenuation with depth increased. Distinct assemblages were identified between surface and deep layer with shade-adapted species. The contribution of DCM was reduced to 10%. Zooplankton community varied in conjunction with phytoplankton and stratification. Our study demonstrates no benefit of DCM for taxonomic and functional diversity and a limited contribution to total production. The depths over which phytoplankton use separate spatial niches may be lesser in a 6-m-deep lake compared with deeper stratified lakes.					; Beisner, Beatrix/ABG-7855-2020	Beisner, Beatrix/0000-0001-6972-6887; Pannard, Alexandrine/0000-0003-2997-5744; Planas, Dolors/0000-0003-0901-2887													0142-7873	1464-3774				NOV-DEC	2020	42	6					630	649		10.1093/plankt/fbaa043	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbaa043													WOS:000595482600003

A descriptive epidemiological study on canine babesiosis in the Lake Geneva region	SCHWEIZER ARCHIV FUR TIERHEILKUNDE												A descriptive study was carried out in the district of the Lake Geneva between March 1, 2005 and August 31,2006 to assess the incidence and prevalence of canine babesiosis, to genotype the Babesia species occurring, to assess the most frequently clinical signs found and to address the potential of autochthonous transmission. This included a data assessment on the different tick-populations occurring in the area and on the prevalence of Babesia-DNA in these ticks. A total of 56 veterinary practices participated in the study. By blood smear and PCI, Babesia canis canis was found in 12 out of 21 cases with suspected babesiosis. In an additional 13th case, the parasite could only be detected by PCR. All autochthonous cases originated from the Western part of the Lake Geneva region. Clinical signs in affected dogs included inappetence, apathy, anemia, fever, hemoglobinuria and thron-ibocytopenia. There were no risk factors with regard to age, sex and breed. Most cases were diagnosed during the spring periods of 2005 and 2006 (11 cases) and two cases in autumn 2005, coinciding with the main activity period of Dermacentor reticulatus, the main vector of B. canis canis. A total of 495 ticks were collected on patients by the veterinarians, 473 were identified as Ixodes sp., 7 as khipicephalus sanguineus and 15 as Dermacentor reticulatus. While Nodes sp. was found in the whole study area, D. reticulatus and R. sanguineus occurred only in the Western part till Lausanne. PCR and sequencing yielded B. canis canis positivity in 3 D. reticulatus specimen, these three ticks were collected from two different dogs both suffering from babesiosis. All R. sanguineus were negative by Babesia-PCR. Global warming, ecological changes in the potential habitat of ticks, increasing host- and vector-populations and increasing mobility of dog owners may be responsible for an emergence situation of infection risk for Babesia spp. by time. E.g.,Dermacentor reticulatus has become autochtonously prevalent already till Lausanne in the Lake Geneva region, and further surveillance is suggested to tackle this problem.

J	Lindenschmidt, KE; Das, A; Chu, T				Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich; Das, Apurba; Chu, Thuan			Air pockets and water lenses in the ice cover of the Slave River	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Communities along the Slave River are concerned about changes in the river ice cover, such as the formation of air pockets and double layers of ice in the ice cover. These anomalies make it challenging to find suitable locations for river ice crossings in winter, necessary for the transportation of goods to and from remote regions and to access hunting, trapping and fishing areas. This study utilized satellite imagery and field observations to document these anomalies of the river ice during the winters from November 2013 to March 2016. Backscatter analysis of the satellite imagery identified low and high density areas of air pockets along the river. Satellite images also revealed cracks and flooding of the river ice, particularly along the downstream reach of the river. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Multi-sensor satellite remote sensing provides an opportunity to map and analyze drawdown frequency and metrics (timing, magnitude, duration) at broad scales. This study developed a cloud computing framework to process time series of synthetic aperture radar (Sentinel 1-SAR) and optical sensor (Landsat 8, Sentinel 2) data to characterize WD in 166 lakes across Massachusetts, USA, during 2016-2021. Comparisons with in situ logger data showed that the Sentinel 1-derived surface water area captured relative water-level fluctuations indicative of WD. A machine learning approach classified lakes as WD versus non-WD based on seasonal water-level fluctuations derived from Sentinel 1-SAR data. The framework mapped WD lakes statewide, revealing prevalence throughout Massachusetts with interannual variability. Results showed WDs occurred in over 75% of lakes during the study period, with high interannual variability in the number of lakes conducting WD. Mean WD magnitude was highest in the wettest year (2018) but % lake area exposure did not show any association with precipitation and varied between 8% to 12% over the 5-year period. WD start date was later and duration was longer in wet years, indicating climate mediation of WD implementation driven by management decisions. The data and tools developed provide an objective information resource to evaluate ecological impacts and guide management of this prevalent but understudied phenomenon. Overall, the results and interactive web tool developed as part of this study provide new hydrologic intelligence to inform water management and policies related to WD practices.					; Kumar, Abhishek/I-4691-2019; He, Xinchen/NRB-1033-2025	Andreadis, Konstantinos/0000-0002-3642-6615; Butler, Caitlyn/0000-0001-6887-3375; Kumar, Abhishek/0000-0002-0956-1766														2072-4292				MAR	2024	16	6							947	10.3390/rs16060947	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16060947													WOS:001192588700001
J	Aljetlawi, AA; Leonardsson, K				Aljetlawi, AA; Leonardsson, K			Survival during adverse seasons reveals size-dependent competitive ability in a deposit-feeding amphipod, Monoporeia affinis	OIKOS												Previous food competition experiments indicated that small Monoporeia affinis (Lindstrom) amphipods are competitively superior to large conspecifics. If this is the case. large individuals Such as adults should be more sensitive than their smaller conspecifics to food shortage during winter. Thus, our hypothesis was that the competitive relationships should be reflected in the winter survival between the different age- (size-) classes. We investigated the effects of starvation on the survival and loss of mass of three age- (size-) classes: juveniles (0 +. young-of-the-year) and (I +, one-year-old), and adults (2 +, two-year-old) amphipods in a 10-week experiment during the winter season. During the starvation period, the survival of the 0 + and I + age-classes decreased gradually with no marked variation between the age-classes over time. while that of the 2 + age-class decreased dramatically after 4 weeks. The survival and swimming activity of adult (2 +) amphipods were significantly lower than in the 0 + and I + age-classes. The individual dry mass (W) of amphipods decreased with a rate equal to -0.0062W(0.95) per day throughout the experiment with no differences between age-classes in the allometric scaling of the energetic Costs. We found no dramatic decrease in the individual dry mass of 2 + age-class similar to that in their Survival. Using the survival results from our study to rank the age-classes in terms of competitive ability gave the same rank order as from an earlier competition experiment. These results suggest that a starvation survival experiment prior to adverse seasons could be used to assess the competitive relationships within and between species exploiting the same resource.																			0030-1299	1600-0706				APR	2003	101	1					164	170		10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.12183.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.12183.x													WOS:000182106600017

Pathways of methane removal in the sediment and water column of a seasonally anoxic eutrophic marine basin	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												Methane (CH4) is a key greenhouse gas. Coastal areas account for a major proportion of marine CH4 emissions. Eutrophication and associated bottom water hypoxia enhance CH4 production in coastal sediments. Here, we assess the fate of CH4 produced in sediments at a site in a seasonally anoxic eutrophic coastal marine basin (Scharendijke, Lake Grevelingen, the Netherlands) in spring (March) and late summer (September) in 2020. Removal of CH4 in the sediment through anaerobic oxidation with sulfate ( SO42- ) is known to be incomplete in this system, as confirmed here by only slightly higher values of delta C-13-CH4 and delta D-CH4 in the porewater in the shallow sulfate-methane-transition zone (similar to 5-15 cm sediment depth) when compared to deeper sediment layers. In March 2020, when the water column was fully oxygenated, CH4 that escaped from the sediment was at least partially removed in the bottom water through aerobic oxidation. In September 2020, when the water column was anoxic below similar to 35 m water depth, CH4 accumulated to high concentrations (up to 73 mu mol L-1) in the waters below the oxycline. The sharp counter gradient in oxygen and CH4 concentrations at similar to 35 m depth and increase in delta C-13-CH4 and delta D-CH4 above the oxycline indicate mostly aerobic water column removal of CH4. Water column profiles of particulate and dissolved Fe and Mn suggest redox cycling of both metals at the oxycline, pointing towards a potential role of metal oxides in CH4 removal. Water column profiles of NH4+ and NO3- indicate removal of both solutes near the oxycline. Analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences retrieved from the water column reveal the presence of aerobic CH4 oxidizing bacteria (Methylomonadaceae) and anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (Methanoperedenaceae), with the latter potentially capable of NO3- and/or metal-oxide dependent CH4 oxidation, near the oxycline. Overall, our results indicate sediment and water column removal of CH4 through a combination of aerobic and anaerobic pathways, which vary seasonally. Some of the CH4 appears to escape from the surface waters to the atmosphere, however. We conclude that eutrophication may make coastal waters a more important source of CH4 to the atmosphere than commonly assumed.

A great variety of PhACs, of generally low concentrations, and the complicated sample preparation, makes circumstantial the accurate detection and quantification. Additionally, there is little information published about the spatiotemporal variation of the PhAC load in a larger catchment area utilised for touristic purposes. In addition to the natural biotic and abiotic changes, the seasonal variation of tourism also has a dramatic impact on water quality and the natural ecosystem in larger catchment areas. Therefore, our aim was to develop a reliable solid-phase extraction (SPE)-superaitical fluid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (SFC-MS/MS) method for simultaneous multi-residue analysis of drugs to reveal the spatiotemporal changes in the PhAC contaminations in the waters of an important touristic region, the catchment area of the largest shallow lake in Central Europe, Lake Balaton (Hungary). The environmental application of the developed method revealed 69 out of the traced 134 chemical compounds, including 15 PhACs, which were detected from natural waters for the first time. Wastewater treatment plant (wwrp) loads have a major role in the PhAC contamination of the studied area; at the same time, the mass tourism-induced PhAC contamination was also detectable. Furthermore, the impact of tourism was indicated by elevated concentrations of recreational substances (e.g., caffeine and illicit drugs) in the touristic season affecting the water quality of this important summer holiday destination.

They span freshwater rivers and lakes to fjords and oceans; they include short- and long-distance anadromous migrants, as well as partially migratory and non-migratory populations; and exhibit both semelparous and iteroparous reproduction. Salmonid life-history strategies represent some of the most diverse on the planet. For this reason, salmonids provide an especially interesting model to study the drivers of these different life-history pathways. Over the past few decades, numerous studies and reviews have been published, although most have focused on ultimate considerations where expected reproductive success of different developmental or life-history strategies are compared. Those that considered proximate causes generally focused on genetics or the environment, with less consideration of physiology. Our objective was therefore to review the existing literature on the role of physiology as a proximate driver for life-history strategies in salmonids. This link is necessary to explore since physiology is at the core of biological processes influencing energy acquisition and allocation. Energy acquisition and allocation processes, in turn, can affect life histories. We find that life-history strategies are driven by a range of physiological processes, ranging from metabolism and nutritional status to endocrinology. Our review revealed that the role of these physiological processes can vary across species and individuals depending on the life-history decision(s) to be made. In addition, while findings sometimes vary by species, results appear to be consistent in species with similar life cycles. We conclude that despite much work having been conducted on the topic, the study of physiology and its role in determining life-history strategies in salmonids remains somewhat unexplored, particularly for char and trout (excluding brown trout) species. Understanding these mechanistic links is necessary if we are to understand adequately how changing environments will impact salmonid populations.					; Davidsen, Jan/KFC-1539-2024; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010; Birnie-Gauvin, Kim/G-5306-2018; Aarestrup, Kim/AAK-9155-2021	Eliason, Erika/0000-0002-0120-7498; Davidsen, Jan Grimsrud/0000-0002-7253-2327; Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; Birnie-Gauvin, Kim/0000-0001-9242-0560; Eldoy, Sindre Havarstein/0000-0002-7992-4921; Aarestrup, Kim/0000-0001-8521-6270													1464-7931	1469-185X				OCT	2021	96	5					2304	2320		10.1111/brv.12753	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/brv.12753		MAY 2021						34043292					WOS:000655111600001
J	Uehlinger, U; Malard, F; Ward, JV				Uehlinger, U; Malard, F; Ward, JV			Thermal patterns in the surface waters of a glacial river corridor (Val Roseg, Switzerland)	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. We examined the thermal patterns of the surface waters in the catchment of the Roseg River, which is fed by the meltwaters of two valley glaciers. One of the glaciers has a lake at its terminus. The river corridor comprised a proglacial stream reach below one glacier, the glacier lake outlet stream, a 2.5-km long complex floodplain and a constrained reach extending to the end of the catchment. 2. Temperatures were continuously measured with temperature loggers at 27 sites between 1997 and 1998. Moreover, from 1997 to 1999, spot measurements were taken at 33-165 floodplain sites (depending on water level) at monthly intervals. 3. The temperature regime of glacial streams, including the glacier lake outlet, was characterised by rapidly increasing temperatures in April and May, a moderate decline from June to September (period of glacial melt) and a subsequent fast decline in autumn. During summer, the lake increased temperatures in the outlet stream by 2-4 degreesC, compared with the adjacent proglacial stream reach. 4. In the main channel (thalweg) of the Roseg River, annual degree-days (DD) ranged from 176 DD in the upper proglacial reach to 1227 DD at the end of the catchment. 5. Thermal variation among different channels within the floodplain was higher than the variation along the entire main channel. Floodplain channels lacking surface connection to the main channel accumulated up to 1661 annual DDs. 6. Thermal heterogeneity within the floodplain was linked to the glacial flow pulse. With the onset of ice melt, temperatures in the main channel and in channels surface-connected to the main channel began to decline, whereas in surface-disconnected channels temperatures continued to increase; as a consequence, thermal heterogeneity at the floodplain scale rose slightly until September. 7. High thermal heterogeneity was not anticipated in the harsh environment of a largely glacierised alpine catchment. The relatively wide range of thermal environments may contribute to the highly diverse zoobenthic community.

These fish were taken at the rate of 4.34 lb. per man-hour, worth $0.77 per hr. to the average fisherman. Variations in the daily catch of S. vitreum were related directly to changes in lake level, and the latter served as indirect measures of water currents. It was suggested that currents affect the movements of fish, and hence their chances of contact with a fisherman''s baited hook.																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1945	33	2					455	459		10.2307/2421341	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2421341													WOS:A1945YA67600005

Seismic and acoustic signatures of surficial mass movements at volcanoes	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Surficial mass movements, such as debris avalanches, rock falls, lahars, pyroclastic flows, and outburst floods, are a dominant hazard at many volcanoes worldwide. Understanding these processes, cataloging their spatiotemporal occurrence, and detecting, tracking, and characterizing these events would advance the science of volcano monitoring and help mitigate hazards. Seismic and acoustic methods show promise for achieving these objectives: many surficial mass movements generate observable seismic and acoustic signals, and many volcanoes are already monitored. Significant progress has been made toward understanding, modeling, and extracting quantitative information from seismic and infrasonic signals generated by surficial mass movements. However, much work remains. In this paper, we review the state of the art of the topic, covering a range of scales and event types from individual rock falls to sector collapses. We consider a full variety of volcanic settings, from submarine to subaerial, shield volcano to stratovolcano. Finally, we discuss future directions toward operational seismo-acoustic monitoring of surficial mass movements at volcanoes. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

In order to avoid problems with disinfection byproducts of both chlorine and chlorine dioxide that were present due to presence of natural organic matter in lake water, the large-scale pilot test of UV irradiation for disinfection of drinking water was started in 2000. This paper presents the results of a 9 months investigation period that includes different seasonal qualities of raw water. During the test period intensive bacteriological monitoring showed that microbial water quality standards could be held. Despite the natural organic matter (NOM) content and very high summer temperatures of water (up to 30degreesC), the disinfection process was successfully conducted solely with the UV-radiation. The waterworks Ponikve continues to change chemical disinfection equipment to UV-radiation.

However, aragonite stalagmites contain ppm-level uranium content, making them much easier to date, achieving higher age-dating precisions than calcite stalagmites. In this regard, provided aragonite-to-calcite transformation did not occur, aragonite stalagmites are potentially well suited for Holocene climate research, given their climate proxies can be placed into a better constrained chronological framework. In this paper, we present high-precision U/Th dates and O isotopic time series for a 82 cm, long, continuous growth aragonite stalagmite, LH2, from Lianhua Cave, Hunan Province, China, and discuss East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) variability for the last 12.5 ka BP (before present). The U/Th-dated delta O-18 sequence with a mean 16-year resolution and the growth rate pattern of LH2 show that EASM experienced a strengthening stage, a strong stage and a weakening stage during the last 12.5 ka. During the YD (12.5-11.5 ka BP), heavy delta O-18 values and low growth rate indicate a weak monsoon period. During the Preboreal (from similar to 11.5 to 10.6 ka BP), delta O-18 values decreased dramatically (similar to 1.94 parts per thousand) reflecting abrupt strengthening of the monsoon. From 10.6 to 4.2 ka BP, the record is characterized by the lightest delta O-18 values and high growth rates, suggesting a strong monsoon period. The summer monsoon weakened substantially after 4.2 ka BP, as inferred from gradually increasing delta O-18 values and decreasing growth rate. Overall, the intensity of the EASM is regulated by summer insolation at 30 degrees N during the last 12.5 ka. Although oxygen isotope fractionation is different between aragonite-H2O and calcite-H2O because of Rayleigh Fractionation Law, the overall temporal pattern of delta O-18 values from aragonite stalagmite LH2 is concordant with other high-resolution Holocene calcite stalagmite records from South China. The comparison among these records shows that the Holocene Optimum was synchronous across Asian continental region influenced by the EASM and Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM), lasting from similar to 10.6 to 4.2 ka BP, as reflected by consistently lighter delta(18)Ovalues among all these records regardless of their latitudinal difference. These records do not support previously reported asynchronism between EASM and ISM. In details, the long-term delta O-18 trend in LH2 is punctuated by a number of centennial fluctuations. For instance, two weak monsoon events occurred at 9232 +/- 57 yr BP and 8137 +/- 21 yr BP, correlating in time with cooling events in Greenland ice cores. The latest weak monsoon event centered at 302 +/- 8 yr BP which is related to the Little Ice Age (LIA). In addition, the monsoon intensity derived from our record also shows a strong connection with latitudinal migration of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) as recorded in the Cariaco Basin sediments. Spectral analysis of delta O-18 values shows that significant peaks match with solar periodicities of 208 yr (de Vries cycle), 86 yr (Gleissberg cycle) or related to Delta C-14 production suggesting shorter-term monsoon variations are forced by solar radiation. Overall, our study suggests that the delta O-18 record in the aragonite stalagmite is highly consistent with those derived from calcite stalagmites, suggesting that aragonite stalagmites are suitable for palaeoclimate reconstruction, especially for the Holocene period, as aragonite calcite transformation has not occurred.

J	KARNER, M; FUKS, D; HERNDL, GJ				KARNER, M; FUKS, D; HERNDL, GJ			BACTERIAL-ACTIVITY ALONG A TROPHIC GRADIENT	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Bacterial biomass, secondary production, and extracellular enzymatic activity [alpha-glucosidase and leucine-aminopeptidase, measured as cleavage of artificial fluorogenic substrates 4-methyl umbelliferyl (MVF) alpha-D-glucopyranoside and L-leucine 7-amido-4-methyl coumarin (MCA)] were measured along a trophic gradient in the Northern Adriatic Sea in four ecologically different situations. Bacterial parameters were compared with chlorophyll a and inorganic and organic nutrient concentrations. Bacterial secondary production and extracellular enzymatic activity markedly changed among different seasons and along the trophic gradient. Average bacterial secondary production increased from 0.61 to 2.09 mug Cl-1 hour-1 preceding a bloom, to 2.09 mug Cl- 1 hour- 1 during the bloom, decreasing again to 0.81 and 0.83 mug Cl- 1 hour-1 in the post-bloom and summer periods, respectively (values from 0.5 m depth). Leucine-aminopeptidase activity showed more consistent trends than alpha-glucosidase activity. Average values of leucine-aminopeptidase activity, measured by enzymatic release of MCA, increased from a pre-bloom value of 164.0 to 1,712.0 (nM MCA) hour-1 released during a bloom, decreasing to 298.5 and 133.7 (nM MCA) hour- 1 released for the post-bloom and summer situation, respectively (values from 0.5 m depth). Average growth rates decreased during the bloom, whereas average extracellular enzymatic activity levels expressed on a cell basis increased by an average factor of 2. Along the trophic gradient, a consistent increase in bacterial secondary production could be observed in all but the summer situation (values from 0.5 m depth). Leucine-aminopeptidase activity also showed positive trends along the gradient, while alpha-glucosidase activity did not exhibit such a clear trend. Bacterial biomass trends were less obvious considering both seasonal changes and the tropic gradient. Highly significant interrelations were detected between bacterial proteolytic activity, secondary production, chlorophyll a content, and nitrate concentrations, especially in the surface horizon.

LIR and TIR were positively correlated. Seasonal variations in the LIR:TIR ratio seemed to be related to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) availability, with higher concentrations favoring protein synthesis. The light:dark ratio of the incorporation rates of both radiotracers was close to 1. However, this ratio tended to be >1 when DOC was lower, namely in winter. A clear diel pattern in bacterial activity was found, with an increasing trend during the night hours. The opposite diel pattern was observed for DOC. BP remained similar across seasons but showed a decrease in late winter during a period of high water discharge through the lagoon and concurrent minimum chlorophyll a concentrations. A comparison between hypertrophic systems aiming to explore the upper BP limit indicated that our BP estimates were considerably high but did not surpass previous values in hypertrophic lakes.

Furthermore, post-restoration monitoring is rarely done or documented. Pashan Lake in Pune, India has been the site of an integrated restoration project since 2005, which was implemented after the lake suffered a decline in quality as a result of increased urbanization and changes in catchment land cover. These restoration efforts focused on improving the abiotic and biological integrity of the lake and included draining, extracting silt and construction debris, developing 2 islands for birds and the planting of indigenous tree species. To assess long-term restoration benefits on the biological and chemical status of the lake, volunteers from the local community and schools were trained to regularly assess water quality following globally recognized and standardized water testing methods suitable for citizen science. In parallel, bird populations around Pashan Lake were studied to identify relationships between species richness or abundance and water conditions. Measurements were made each month during the 18-mo period from December 2014 to June 2016. We found that species richness and abundance of birds around the lake increased following restoration and that nutrient concentrations (N-NO3 and P-PO4) decreased within the lake. Changes in avifauna diversity were most strongly associated with hydrological conditions related to water-level fluctuation and chemical conditions related to pH. Peak turbidity levels were observed during later winter and summer periods, which were weakly and positively correlated to wetland bird diversity. Citizen scientist assessments of lake ecosystems that combine water-quality tests, wetland bird surveys, and visual observations of environmental conditions provided important insights into the effectiveness of restoration activities in this urban ecosystem. Furthermore, citizen science increased advocacy in the local community.																			2161-9549	2161-9565				JUN 1	2019	38	2					332	341		10.1086/703440	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/703440													WOS:000474076400010

Dynamics of diurnal cycles and impacts of cyanobacteria diel vertical migration	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												As an important shallow subtropical lake for Florida agriculture and the Everglades, Lake Okeechobee has experienced strong phytoplankton blooms, often dominated by cyanobacteria, over the past several decades. It is well-known that some cyanobacteria, including Microcystis aeruginosa, may migrate vertically over a day-night cycle due to changes of cell and colony buoyancy. Yet, the implications of this migrating behavior to overall bloom dynamics in the lake remain unclear. Using a newly developed coupled physical-biogeochemical model, this study examined the diurnal cycle of cyanobacteria blooms during summertime in the lake, focusing on the interactions between physical processes (e.g., currents, vertical mixing) and diel vertical migration (DVM) of cyanobacteria. Limited field evidence of cyanobacteria DVM, based on in situ phytoplankton biovolume at the surface and the daily optical observations by a Sea Photometer Revision for Incident Surface Measurements (SeaPrism) radiometer, were also presented, which were largely consistent with modeled results. Model results indicate that in the central lake, upward migration of cyanobacteria in the morning allowed cells to concentrate at the surface layer, alleviating light limitation and promoting cell growth. At the same time, prevailing southerly or southeasterly winds moved the cells toward the northern and northwestern lake. At night, strong vertical mixing due to surface cooling and wind mixing re-distributed the cells vertically. Over diurnal cycles, however, vertical processes (DVM, mixing, surface growth) were dominant over the horizontal transport. As a result, surface cyanobacteria biomass were highest in late morning and around noontime but decreased rapidly in the afternoon. Nevertheless, horizontal transport of cells would repeat almost every day from late spring throughout the summer, leading to accumulations of cyanobacteria cells often in long, narrow bands (< 2 km wide) along the northwestern and northern lake. In addition, the seasonality of cyanobacteria blooms appears to be dominated by the seasonal changes of water temperature and winds. This new understanding of cyanobacteria bloom dynamics may have significant implications to field monitoring, bloom forecasting, and water management decisions.

Animal behavior is especially difficult to observe when selection of habitat and activities are linked to energy costs of long-distance movement. Migrating communities tend to be resource specific and prefer environments that offer more suitability for coexisting in a shared space and time. Given the recent advances in digital technologies, digital video recording systems are gaining popularity in wildlife research and management. We used digital video recording cameras to study social interactions and species-habitat linkages for wintering waterbirds communities in shared habitats. Examining over 8,640 hr of video footages, we built tetrapartite social-behavioral association network of wintering waterbirds over habitat (n = 5) selection events in sites with distinct management regimes. We analyzed these networks to identify hub species and species role in activity persistence, and to explore the effects of hydrological regime on these network characteristics. Although the differences in network attributes were not significant at treatment level (p = .297) in terms of network composition and keystone species composition, our results indicated that network attributes were significantly different (p = .000, r(2) = .278) at habitat level. There were evidences suggesting that the habitat quality was better at the managed sites, where the formed networks had more species, more network nodes and edges, higher edge density, and stronger intra- and inter-species interactions. In addition, we also calculated the species interaction preference scores (SIPS) and behavioral interaction preference scores (BIPS) of each network. The results showed that species synchronize activities in shared space for temporal niche partitioning in order to avoid or minimize any potential competition for shared space. Our social network analysis (SNA) approach is likely to provide a practical use for ecosystem management and biodiversity conservation.					; Hassan, Muhammad Azher/GYA-2161-2022; Rasool, Muhammad Awais/GWM-9226-2022; Guangchun, Lei/ABC-8081-2021; ZENG, Qing/V-9563-2019	WEN, LI/0000-0003-3783-3826; Lei, guangchun/0000-0001-9021-5758; Rasool, Muhammad Awais/0000-0003-0051-598X; Hassan, Muhammad Azher/0000-0002-6307-1581; 													2045-7758					MAR	2021	11	5					2321	2335		10.1002/ece3.7200	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.7200		FEB 2021						33717458					WOS:000613559400001

Fish in the upper part of this interval showed a propensity to leave the lake. Migration took place during spring freshets and was directed up-stream. The migrants had a significantly (p < 0.05) lower condition factor than residents, indicating that they were less successful in the competition for food, and that the current feeding situation of a fish affected its migratory behaviour. Migrants entered many of the tributaries of L. Visjon, but a majority of the migrants ended up in unproductive habitats and returned downstream shortly after the ascent. Some of the migrants found their way to two very productive lakes that were utilized for summer feeding. These successful migrants overwintered in L. Visjon but repeated the seasonal habitat shifts over 3-4 consecutive years, after which residency in L. Visjon was adopted. Such repeat migrants grew considerably faster (annual length increments up to five times higher for migrants) and reproduced in L. Visjon two years earlier compared to residents. No straying seemed to occur among repeat migrants, who returned precisely to the productive lakes each year. However, all-though some migrants were successful, the costs involved with the migration were high. Therefore, the overall conclusion was that migrants had a lower average fitness than residents. Production in the the productive lakes has been dropping over the last 15 years, which has resulted in successively deteriorating feeding conditions for fish, a decrease in the numbers of repeat migrants and a reduction in charr biomass. We found a strong positive correlation between relative productivity and the degree of utilization of the distant habitat. Charr biomass in the distant habitat was regulated via changes in the frequency of repeat migration in each size class in response to feeding conditions.																			0030-1299	1600-0706				APR	1993	66	3					538	546		10.2307/3544950	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3544950													WOS:A1993KZ32600020

In Lake Ontario, Hemimysis is most abundant at nearshore habitats characterised by cobble-rubble substrate, which it shares with the round goby Neogobius melanostomus (hereafter goby). To better understand the interaction if any between gobies and Hemimysis, gobies were collected throughout the summer and fall periods at three shallow (<3 m) nearshore locations representing eastern, central, and western Lake Ontario where Hemimysis are relatively abundant. Goby stomach contents were examined for evidence of Hemimysis and other prey. In addition, gobies were collected at two locations in southwestern Lake Ontario in shallow- (3 m) and deep- (11 m) water nearshore habitat where stomach contents were also used to characterise diet. Despite higher Hemimysis abundance nearshore. Hemimysis were not consumed by any gobies collected from shallow nearshore locations, and only found in three of 23 gobies collected at the deep site. Goby abundance and consumption of Hemimysis by gobies at the deep site were unrelated to Hemimysis abundance in traps. At all locations, gobies fed on soft-bodied invertebrates and dreissenids although dreissenids were the dominant prey among large (> 74 mm) gobies. We suspect that the ability of Hemimysis to avoid predation by gobies is the result of a combination of anti-predator behaviours such as an evasive startle response, reduced activity and depth dependent segregation in interstitial spaces during the day, and a feeding mode used by gobies that is poorly suited for an evasive species like Hemimysis.

In many other aspects arctic deltas differ little from deltas found elsewhere, i.e. they have distributaries, sand bars, mudflats, sand dunes, subaerial and subaqueous portions and various kinds of lakes. Included among the unique forms in arctic deltas are ice wedges, ice-wedge polygons, pingos and thermokarst lakes. The 600 km(2) Colville River delta in northern Alaska illustrates well the forms and processes typical of arctic deltas and also illustrates the relationship between an arctic delta and its drainage basin, the ocean, the atmosphere and the biosphere. The drainage basin, which occupies about 1/3 of the North Slope of Alaska, is confined entirely to the continuous permafrost zone north of the Brooks Range. It is a region where snow cover (albeit generally thin) and river, lake and sea ice last for eight to nine months. During that period of time, geomorphic activity is minimal. Hydrologically, the sea is connected with the river in the deeper parts of the river's channels so that sea water penetrates beneath river ice some distance upstream during winter. In contrast fresh water flow during winter from the basin is virtually nil because of the frozen surface of water bodies and a frozen active layer which eliminates ground water as a source. Snow melt, which generally begins in May, gradually leads to breakup. A pre-breakup flood period is followed by breakup and post-break flooding; combined they last about three weeks. During that period, flood water flowing against riverbanks can cause thermoerosional niching which often leads to bank collapse. The character of the bank collapse depends to a large extent on the texture and type of frozen bank material. During breakup flooding, water flows over the bottom-fast ice of the river, into connected lakes and out to the sea. Much of the river's suspended load is deposited in these overflow areas. As floodwater progresses out over the sea ice it eventually flows down through pressure ridge cracks and scour holes to progress seaward beneath the floating ice. Being a low-lying area and being situated in the Arctic, arctic deltas are vulnerable to climatic and sea-level changes. Changes in temperature, snow fall, duration and extent of sea ice, and active layer thickness are among the many changes that would have major impacts on deltaic processes and forms.																			0924-5499	2215-0072	1-4020-0663-2				2002	68						159	183																WOS:000178260200008

Extreme climatic events and human activities have resulted in the degradation and redistribution of habitat over the last few decades. However, the effects of habitat changes on the abundance of waterbirds remain unclear. We used long-term waterbird monitoring data and Landsat remote-sensing data to characterize changes in abundance and the relationship between habitat variation and abundance. A total of 113 waterbird species were recorded in the wintering period between 1999 and 2021, including 23 globally threatened species. Greater White-fronted Goose (Anser albifrons), Swan Goose (Anser cygnoides), Bean Goose (Anser fabalis), and Tundra Swan (Cygnus columbianus) were the dominant species. A total of 46 species with more than 6 annual surveys and average abundance >100 were recorded between 1999 and 2021. For most species, the mean abundance across all sub-lakes was higher in the first year than in the last year, and no obvious changes were observed over the last 20 years. The mean abundances of the vulnerable species Hooded Crane (Grus monacha) and White-naped Crane (Grus vipio) significantly declined between 1999 and 2021. No significant changes in the mean abundance of all foraging groups were observed. The area of water bodies increased, and the area of mudflats decreased. For most species with significant changes in abundance, habitat change did not greatly contribute to variation in mean abundance. The reduction in the area of mudflats greatly contributed to declines in the mean abundance of the gray heron (Ardea cinerea) and gadwall (Anas strepera).

Climate-Driven Changes in Dissolved Organic Carbon and Water Clarity in Arctic Lakes of West Greenland	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												To assess climate-mediated terrestrial-aquatic linkages in Arctic lakes and potential impacts on light attenuation and carbon cycling, we evaluated lake responses to climate drivers in two areas of west Greenland with differing climate patterns. We selected four lakes in a warmer, drier area to compare with four lakes from a cooler, wetter area proximal to the Greenland Ice Sheet. In June from 2013-2018, we measured epilimnetic water temperature, 1% depth of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA(254)), DOC-normalized absorbance at 380 nm (a*(380)), and chlorophyll a. Interannual coherence of 1% PAR and DOC was particularly high for lakes within the warmer, drier area. This coherence suggests forcing of Arctic lake features by a large-scale driver, likely climate. Redundancy analysis showed that monthly average precipitation, winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index (NAO(W)), spring average air temperature, and spring average precipitation influenced the lake variables (p = 0.003, adj. R-2 = 0.58). In particular, monthly average precipitation contributed to increases in soil-derived DOC quality metrics and chlorophyll a and decreased 1% PAR. Interannual changes in lake responses to climate drivers were more apparent in the warmer, drier area than the cooler, wetter area. The interannual lake responses within and between areas, associated with climate trends, suggest that with ongoing rapid climate change in the Arctic, there could be widespread impacts on key lake responses important for light attenuation and carbon cycling. Plain Language Summary Arctic lakes are particularly vulnerable to rapid climate change. To assess how climate factors influence lake characteristics important for water clarity and carbon cycling, we measured responses of lake variables to climate in two sets of lakes in west Greenland with different climate characteristics-a warmer, drier area and a cooler, wetter area. We found evidence that the lakes are responding similarly to climate factors, especially in the warmer, drier area. High ratios of lake surface area to depth and catchment to lake area, as well as lower inputs of precipitation may be responsible for these patterns of lake variable responses in the warmer, drier area. Mean annual precipitation was a primary control of soil-derived carbon inputs and water clarity in the lakes. These findings suggest that with ongoing climate change in the Arctic, there could be widespread impacts on key controls of lake ecology and carbon cycling. Key Points Dissolved organic carbon and water clarity in Arctic lakes are responsive to climate forcing Arctic lakes with limited hydrological connectivity exhibit coherent responses to climate forcing Lake responses are more coherent in lakes with greater surface area: mean depth and catchment: lake area and lower precipitation inputs					Fowler, Rachel/JFA-1083-2023; Osburn, Chris/A-9339-2010	Fowler, Rachel/0000-0002-4906-6372; Saros, Jasmine/0000-0002-7652-9985; Osburn, Christopher/0000-0002-9334-4202													2169-8953	2169-8961				FEB	2020	125	2								10.1029/2019JG005170	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JG005170													WOS:000534472900029
J	Assel, R; Rodionov, S				Assel, R; Rodionov, S			Atmospheric teleconnections for annual maximum ice cover on the Laurentian Great Lakes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Great Lake ice cover records for winters 1963-1990 were used to define anomalously high (low) average ice cover based on the seven highest (seven lowest) annual maximum ice covers. Analysis of the maximum ice cover reveals (i) a low (1964-1976); (ii) a high (1977-1982); and (iii) once again a low (1983-1990) ice cover regime. The high ice cover regime corresponded in part with a hiatus in El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events and the beginning of an interdecadal change in Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation that started in the late 1970s. About 46% of the lowest quartile ice covers occurred during the mature phase (year + one winter) of El Nino. Only 1 year out of seven with the mature phase of El Nino between 1963 and 1990 was not associated with the lowest quartile ice cover, this was 1977, a pivotal year after which a new climatic regime in the Northern Hemisphere was established. Anomaly maps of 700 hPa geopotential height for the lowest quartile ice cover reveal a zonal flow pattern. Highest quartile ice cover was associated with meridonal circulation from the Arctic directed toward the Great Lakes. Significant differences occur for highest minus lowest quartile ice cover composite 700 hPa height anomaly maps in the Pacific Ocean, the west coast of North America, north Mexico, eastern North America, north central Siberia, western Europe and the adjacent North Atlantic. Correlations between first differences (year t+1 minus year t) of annual maximum ice cover and 700 hPa geopotential heights for winters 1963-1990 agrees with these teleconnections and were higher than the absolute time series correlations, indicating strong interannual teleconnections. Annual maximum ice cover was also significantly correlated with the tropical Northern Hemisphere teleconnection index.

We derived under-ice dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics from high-frequency observations and modified a widely used lake metabolism model by including the effect of freezing and thawing on DO concentration. Estimates were produced for the production and respiration in a shallow lake on the Mongolian Plateau in three winters. Diel, synoptic, and seasonal variations in DO concentration were detected as responses to solar radiation, episodic snowfall events, and occasional convective mixing. Based on the observations and a radiative transfer model, incident solar radiation was partitioned into reflectance, absorbance, and transmittance by the snow and ice cover. For bare ice, the contributions of these three parts were 35%, 39%, and 26%, respectively, while under a new 4.5 cm thick snow cover, the corresponding values were 79%, 17%, and 3%. This points out the critical role of snow and ice on under-ice light conditions, which is the primary forcing for the temperature and the rate of photosynthesis under ice. The results showed three principal factors, which influenced under-ice DO and metabolism: (1) thickness and optical properties of ice and snow, which affected the light transfer and depth of the euphotic zone, (2) mediated radiation and ice-water heat transfer which controlled water temperature, and (3) DO exclusion during freezing and dilution by melt water. This study highlights the ecosystem characteristics in shallow ice-covered lakes in arid temperate regions and promotes our understanding of the response of the cold aquatic environment to climate change.					; Li, Zhijun/A-5299-2019	Huang, Wenfeng/0000-0001-6694-1194; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				MAY	2021	57	5							e2020WR027990	10.1029/2020WR027990	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020WR027990													WOS:000654464300015

J	Broster, BE; Burke, KBS				Broster, B. E.; Burke, K. B. S.			Geological and site specific factors influencing earthquake hazard assessment for New Brunswick, Canada	ATLANTIC GEOLOGY												Seismic hazard studies by Earthquakes Canada place most of New Brunswick in the moderate part of the hazard range. Limitations are identified with the documented earthquake database suggesting that revisions are necessary for location and magnitude of some of the known historical earthquakes. In addition, the disturbance from a given event magnitude can be modified by local geological conditions and site specific factors. This is particularly true for New Brunswick, where many of the communities were settled along river valleys and coastal areas, which are underlain by thick deposits of glacial and alluvial sediments that can amplify ground motion. The historical documentation and paleoseismic studies that identify seismic-generated disturbances are reviewed in this paper. Ground motion from both moderate (4 M(N)) local and large (> 5 M(N)) regional earthquakes represents a hazard at some locations and particularly those sites adjacent to steep slopes or sites underlain by thick surficial deposits. Amplification of ground motion would be expected at sites overlying low shear wave velocity zones typical of alluvial sediments. This may explain the larger shaking effects experienced in the downtown area of Fredericton from distant earthquakes. Alteration of springs, rivers and groundwater supplies has happened as a result of earthquakes, although few effects remain permanent. Reports of earthquake-generated tsunamis and lake seiches are rare for New Brunswick. Earthquake-induced rock falls occurred along some rock slopes during moderate earthquakes in 1855 and 1937, and a landslide occurred in marine sediments possibly triggered by a minor unrecorded local tremor in 1977. This study identifies the need for future paleoseismic research and microzonation studies for the major communities within the province.																			0843-5561						2011	47						99	111		10.4138/atlgeol.2011.004	http://dx.doi.org/10.4138/atlgeol.2011.004													WOS:000298860900006
J	Elliott, SR; Coe, TA; Helfield, JM; Naiman, RJ				Elliott, SR; Coe, TA; Helfield, JM; Naiman, RJ			Spatial variation in environmental characteristics of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) rivers	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES					International Workshop on Integrating Across Scales - Predicting Patterns of Change in Atlantic Salmon	MAR, 1997	BRAEMAR, SCOTLAND					Rivers and streams occupied by anadromous Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) occur across a diverse array of landscapes. This article describes the general ecology of these rivers and streams, including many of the physical and biological variables that are important characteristics of all lotic systems. For analytical purposes, the geographic range of Atlantic salmon rivers is divided into dye regions, based on geomorphology and climate. The physical habitat available to anadromous Atlantic salmon is diverse. The geology varies from granitic bedrock to volcanic and glacial substrates, which influence a broad array of other ecological variables, ranging from water chemistry to catchment morphology (e.g., river length). Flood regimes and system hydrology are dependent, as expected, on climate. Many of the catchments receive substantial precipitation in the form of snow; rivers in four of the five regions experience primarily spring freshets. Aquatic temperatures are also variable, representing close to the full range of thermal tolerance of S, salar, with lows just above 0 degrees C in the northernmost latitudes to summer highs in western Europe approaching 25 degrees C. Most rivers are best characterized as oligotrophic with relatively low annual primary productivity. However, physical factors such as availability of suitable spawning and rearing habitat, as well as aquatic temperature and flow regimes, may drive anadromous productivity. In general, most of the rivers have been modified by flow regulation and many suffer from impacts related to other anthropogenic disturbances, principally riparian forest clearing for agriculture, forestry, and urban development. We conclude that the rivers and streams occupied by anadromous Atlantic salmon are diverse across the species' range and have been heavily impacted by anthropogenic disturbances.

However, knowledge of its features and associated environmental factors is still very limited. In this study, we investigated the quantitative relationship between the amount of CH4 emitted via ebullition and changes in the atmospheric pressure through a laboratory experiment. During the flux measurement period, ebullition was recorded almost exclusively in air-pressure-declining phases. The increased volume of the gas bubbles due to reduction in atmospheric pressure and the amount of released gas bubbles revealed a strong linear relation, suggesting that in situ CH4 emissions via ebullition can be estimated using this correlation. Our results clearly showed that atmospheric pressure can be one of the most important factors to control CH4 emissions from peatlands and that ebullition can be the main transport mechanism during the pressure-falling phase.

Distribution and habitat switching was measured with bimonthly bottom-trawl surveys repeated throughout the summer. Patterns of daily growth increments on otoliths were used to measure the history of habitat residence, individual size at the time of the habitat switch, and habitat-specific growth rates. Laboratory experiments and known-age fish confirmed daily increment formation of otoliths. After dispersing during an initial pelagic larval stage, postlarval juveniles settled in both the warm, food-rich littoral zone and the cold, unproductive profundal zone. During summer, initial profundal-zone inhabitants underwent a unidirectional habitat shift to the more productive littoral zone. Fish that moved to the littoral zone grew twice as fast as those in the profundal zone and encountered little apparent predation mortality risk there. Habitat shifts were therefore consistent with both growth optimization and predatory avoidance. However, shifts occurred at a wide range of body sizes throughout the summer. The large spatial scale of the lake, limited swimming ability of juvenile fish, diel migratory behavior, and lack of complex habitat structure may preclude shifts at discrete body sizes for this species.

Ongoing anthropogenic eutrophication of the catchment area threatens the Donana World Heritage Site (South-west Spain)	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Eutrophication is a major cause of wetland degradation worldwide. In recent decades, reductions in nutrient inputs have led to improvements in water quality in many rivers and lakes in central and northern Europe, but long-term trends are less clear in southern Europe. We conducted the first comprehensive study of water quality in Donana (SW Spain), one of the most important wetland complexes in Europe and the Mediterranean region. The core area of Donana is a large shallow, seasonal marsh (UNESCO World Heritage Site-WHS) that floods during rainy, cool winter months, then dries out during the summer. The marsh is fed by three main streams whose catchments are within a Biosphere Reserve but are impacted by greenhouses (for cultivating fruit, irrigated with groundwater), poorly treated urban wastewaters and tourism. From 2013 to 2016, we monitored nutrient (Total P, Total N, PO4-3, NH4+, NO3-, NO2-) and phytoplankton chlorophyll-a (chla) concentrations in surface waters of the Donana marsh and the three main streams. We quantified changes in greenhouse cover since 1995 using satellite images. Nutrient concentrations in streams were consistently higher than in the marsh, particularly in the Partido and Rocina streams that regularly reached concentrations equivalent to a "bad physico-chemical status" under the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD), and whose catchments suffered a fivefold expansion of greenhouses from 1995 to 2016. The Partido was the most polluted stream, and the most affected by wastewater effluents, and had particularly high concentrations of NH4+ (Geometric Mean = 0.3 mg L-1) and NO2- (GM = 0.52 mg L-1) across seasons. Patterns in chla concentrations were less consistent, but streams (GM = 6.78 mu g L-1) generally had higher concentrations than the marsh (GM = 4.27 mu g L-1). Nutrient concentrations in spot samples within the marsh largely depended on a combination of evaporation (as revealed by higher stable isotope delta H-2 values in the water column) and spatial processes (concentrations increase close to stream entry points, where conductivity is lower). Anthropogenic nutrient pollution in entry streams is a serious problem in Donana, with extensive stretches too toxic for fish. Reinforcement of policies aimed at reducing nutrient inputs to Donana are urgently required to meet the biodiversity conservation and environmental objectives for the WHS and WFD, respectively. Paradoxically, the marsh is currently relied upon to purify the water entering from streams.

J	Hudon, C; Carignan, R				Hudon, Christiane; Carignan, Richard			Cumulative impacts of hydrology and human activities on water quality in the St. Lawrence River (Lake Saint-Pierre, Quebec, Canada)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The cumulative impacts of discharge and human activities on the spatial variations of water quality were assessed from monthly measurements at 80-110 stations in a similar to 300 km(2) widening of the St. Lawrence River (Lake Saint-Pierre, Quebec). Water quality was poorest under high discharge conditions and in shallow riparian areas under the influence of small tributaries draining farmlands; spatial variability was amplified by aquatic macrophytes. In 2004, over 40% of the study area exceeded the provincial water quality criterion (total phosphorus = 30 mu g P.L-1) to protect aquatic life in rivers. Nutrient retention occurred mostly during summer when macrophytes were abundant and current velocities were low. Erosion of dredged deposits near the navigation channel was observed during summer, when current velocities increased in the deep channel because of flow obstruction by macrophytes growing in shallow areas. Low discharge conditions and high macrophyte abundance sharpened the contrast between the Lake Ontario waters flowing rapidly through the central river channel and the slow-flowing, low-quality tributary waters along the shores. The cumulative effect of high nutrient inflow from urban areas and farmlands, the man-made navigation channel, and seasonal flow obstruction by macrophytes thus induce a marked spatial variability in water quality within Lake Saint-Pierre.

M.			Fundamental drivers of dissolved organic matter composition across an Arctic effective precipitation gradient	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The standard model for aquatic ecosystems is to link hydrologic connectivity to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition and, ultimately, reactivity. Studies across effective precipitation gradients have been suggested as models for predicting how carbon cycling will change in Arctic aquatic ecosystems with projected drying (i.e., reduced hydrologic connectivity). To evaluate links between DOM dynamics and hydrologic connectivity, 41 stream samples from Greenland were analyzed across an effective precipitation gradient for DOM optical properties and elemental composition using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry. Sites with negative effective precipitation and decreased hydrologic connectivity exhibited elevated specific conductivity (SpC) and DOC concentrations as well as DOM composition indicative of decreased hydrologic connectivity, for example, lower aromaticity, assessed using carbon-specific UV absorbance at 254 nm, decreased relative abundances of polyphenolic and condensed aromatic compounds, and increased relative abundances of highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds. Allochthonous inputs decreased as the summer progressed as exhibited by decreases in aromatic compounds. A decrease in molecular richness and N-containing compounds coincided with the decrease in allochthonous inputs. DOC concentrations increased over the summer but more slowly than SpC, suggesting degradation processes outweighed combined evapoconcentration and production. The patterns in DOM composition suggest evapoconcentration and photodegradation are dominant controls. However, when hydrologic connectivity was high, regardless of effective precipitation, DOM reflected allochthonous sources such as snowmelt-fed wetlands. These results highlight the challenges of modeling carbon cycling in aquatic ecosystems across effective precipitation gradients, particularly those with strong seasonality and regional variability in hydrologic inputs.

As crustacean zooplankton obtain most of their Ca from lake water, taxa with high Ca demands may be negatively affected if environmental Ca concentrations fall below thresholds necessary for adequate Ca uptake rates. Currently, Ca concentrations are falling in many soft-water lakes with a history of acid deposition, both within Canada and globally. Hence, there is a need to identify species with high Ca demands. We analyzed Ca concentrations of eight crustacean zooplankton taxa from nine lakes spanning a 0.4-35 mg center dot L-1 Ca gradient. Our objectives were to determine (i) if both species identity and lake Ca concentrations are determinants of zooplankton Ca concentration and (ii) if zooplankton Ca concentration varies seasonally. Large differences in Ca concentrations were observed among taxa. Levels in Daphnia sp. ranged from 2% to 8% of dry body weight, whereas levels in copepods and non-daphniid cladocera were much lower at 0.2%-0.4%. Seasonal variation in zooplankton Ca concentration was negligible, but positive correlations with lake Ca concentration were detected, with up to twofold differences in Ca concentration between lakes in three of the eight species. Species identity was the most important determinant of crustacean zooplankton Ca concentration.					; Yan, Norman/H-5235-2013; Jeziorski, Adam/AAJ-6982-2020	Yan, Norman/0000-0003-4870-6865; Jeziorski, Adam/0000-0001-7701-7247; 													0706-652X					MAY	2006	63	5					1007	1013		10.1139/F06-019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F06-019													WOS:000238285600006

Due to the lack of extended core records and high-resolution stratigraphic chronology, the strata correlation between continental and marine basin since the Quaternary still has considerable limitations. Here, we present a high-resolution grain size and geochemical study of core CSDP-1 (similar to 3.5 Ma) recovered from the western South Yellow Sea (SYS), China. Two sensitive components were extracted from sediments, and their contents can be used to reflect the paleo-hydrodynamic intensity and reconstruct paleoclimate change. A comprehensive analysis including lithologic characteristics of sediments and seismic data interpretation, shows that the stratum deposition at the borehole's location is relatively continuous at the orbital time-scale. The results of spectral analysis, show that the fine sensitive component it records the periodic change information of the Earth's orbital parameters (similar to 400-, 100-, 40-, and 20-kyr), and the astronomical chronology was established successfully. The variations of sensitive components in the sediments reveals that the SYS paleoclimate has undergone four periods since the Quaternary: cold conditions during 2.58-2.49 Ma and 1.88-0.83 Ma, warm and humid conditions during 2.49-1.88 Ma and 0.83-0 Ma. Moreover, the stratum in the SYS shelf records the Middle Pleistocene climate transition (MPT). It is inferred that the MPT in the SYS is mainly manifested by the enhancement of the 100-kyr period related to the synchronous forcing of the similar to 400-kyr eccentricity.					wang, liyan/NMJ-4452-2025; Li, Guangxue/R-5670-2018														0025-3227	1872-6151				SEP	2021	439								106557	10.1016/j.margeo.2021.106557	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.margeo.2021.106557		JUL 2021											WOS:000680656200009

Although the water fluxes are relatively high, glacial mountain lakes represent sensitive areas to human induced disturbances such as atmospheric transported pollutants and pollution generated on site, usually by tourist fluxes. These anthropic inputs can influence water quality and aquatic ecosystems and decrease the ecosystem services provided by the mountain areas. Due to the generally low content of dissolved substances, mountain lakes are sensitive to minor changes in water chemistry, and periodic sampling can serve as early warning in identifying dangerous trends in environmental quality on larger scales. The survey was carried out in 2011 and 2012. In all the surveys, the lakes were sampled in summer-early autumn in the ice-free period. Water samples were collected from three different sites for each lake covering the entire lake surface and were analyzed for a pre-defined set of physical and chemical indicators. Water pH levels ranged between 7.2 - 7.9 and electrical conductivity between 14.2 - 101.5 mu S cm(-1). Heavy metals show low concentration in the analyzed water lakes: zinc (1.41-4.04 mu g L-1), manganese (0.59-5.02 mu g L-1), nickel (0.28-1.12 mu g L-1), copper (1.45-5.29 mu g L-1), cadmium (0.21-0.4 mu g L-1) which are below the maximum allowed concentration for first quality class according to Romanian legislation. In contrast, measured lead concentration varied between 1.29-5.54 mu g L-1.The results have shown a generally good water quality, the majority of the lakes can be classified as first quality class excepting Balea Lake and Pietrosul Lake with values according the second class, due to a slight increase in lead concentration, attributed to atmospheric transport and deposition for Pietrosu Lake, and in Balea Lake case due to road traffic or local unknown sources.

Feeding ecology of Atlantic sturgeon, Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus Mitchill, 1815 on the infauna of intertidal mudflats of Minas Basin, Bay of Fundy	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												A large feeding aggregation of Atlantic sturgeon occupies the inner Bay of Fundy during summer, presumably to forage on the intertidal mudflats. The feeding habits of Atlantic sturgeon were examined during summer 2011 in Minas Basin as description of diet is important for identifying critical foraging areas. Atlantic sturgeon demonstrated an overall preference for sandy tube-dwelling polychaetes (Index of Relative Importance (IRI)=99.7%). Major prey taxa included Maldanidae (Clymanella sp., 52.5%) and Spionidae, primarily the species Spiophanes bombyx (41.6%). Other prey items consumed included Phyllodocidae (Eteone sp., 2.1%), Nephtyidae (2.2%), Nereididae (0.7%), and Glyceridae including Glycera dibranchiata (0.6%). Seventeen additional taxa were identified in trace amounts (mean IRI=0.02%), including Corophidae and Mysidae. There was no significant difference in the number of prey items consumed and the fork length of the fish. Analysis of gut fullness with respect to tidal state indicated no significant difference between gut fullness on the flood or ebb tide. An overall preference for sandy tube-dwelling polychaetes may indicate that particular areas of the Minas Basin intertidal region are more important than others to these foraging fish. Considerable baitworm harvesting occurs during summer months in Minas Basin and could potentially create impacts with sturgeon consumers, both directly through competition for prey items and indirectly through change in sediment and benthic community composition.																			0175-8659	1439-0426				JUN	2013	29	3					503	509		10.1111/jai.12175	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jai.12175													WOS:000318569800004

The distribution of aerosol over the whole country is interpolated from these data. Four Sun-photometers also have been used to measure the data of AOD nearby four of these lakes for validating the remote sensing algorithm of satellite. The result shows that the southeast region of China has the biggest AOD over four seasons of the year and the value of AOD has slight variety between different seasons; the northwest area of China has a maximum in spring, but in other seasons, the value of AOD is low. This result fit to the fact that spring is the dry season in northwest of China and dust storm often occurs in this area, other season seldom has dust storm. The high value of AOD in the southeast China is coincident with the intensive industry, agriculture and other human activities in this region.					; LI, Chengcai/B-4654-2012	LI, Chengcai/0000-0001-8860-1916; 													0277-786X		0-8194-3803-0				2001	4150						258	265		10.1117/12.416965	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.416965													WOS:000169001200028

Modeling the Influence of Environmental Factors on Spawning Migration Mortality for Sockeye Salmon Fisheries Management in the Fraser River, British Columbia	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The impact of freshwater environmental factors on spawning migration mortality was modeled to provide a predictive tool for fisheries management of four run timing groups of Fraser River sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka: early Stuart (Stuart Lake), early summer, summer, and late. We tested the significance of different measures of water temperature, discharge, fish abundance, and entry timing for forecasting discrepancies between lower-river and upriver escapement estimates using multiple regressions of principal component scores. Descriptive discrepancy models (i.e., "management adjustment'' models) identified using Akaike's information criterion were consistent with the known biology of each group. For example, temperature and discharge thresholds were selected for early Stuart run discrepancy models, reflecting the extremes in both variables experienced by these early migrants. Predictive discrepancy models were also generated for each run timing group by using the limited number of environmental variables that are available in-season to fisheries managers. Even predictive discrepancy models using simple environmental metrics of average river temperature, flow, and river entry timing provide a valuable tool for forecasting relative indices of spawning migration mortality. This study provides an example of how environmentally based predictive tools can be used to inform fisheries management decisions and improve the probability of achieving spawning escapement targets.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAY	2010	139	3					768	782		10.1577/T08-223.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T08-223.1													WOS:000277639200013

Climate and nutrient influences on the growth of white spruce trees in the boreal forests of the Yukon	CLIMATE RESEARCH												The boreal forests of North America are undergoing major changes because of the direct effects of global warming and increased CO2 levels. Plant production in the boreal forest is nutrient limited, and we examined how long-term fertilization affected growth of white spruce Picea glauca in the face of these major changes. We conducted a large-scale experiment by fertilizing two 1 km(2) stands of white spruce in the southwestern Yukon with commercial NPK fertilizer from 1987 to 1994, Tree growth was measured by the width of annual increments in 60 trees from each of 2 control and of 2 matched fertilized 1 km(2) sites for the period from 1977 to 1997 in a before, during, and after experimental design. Ring widths increased in both control and fertilized trees over this period as summer temperatures increased. Ring widths in fertilized trees increased from 9 to 48 % over control trees during the years in which fertilizer was added, but immediately fell back to control levels from 1995 to 1997 at 1 site as soon as fertilization was stopped. In the long term, nitrogen in these forests may become tied up in shrubs, grasses, herbs, and fungi and not be available to the trees. There are 2 other possible explanations for this lack of sustained tree growth: first, the conversion of nitrogen into a form not readily available to spruce and, second, a spruce bark beetle outbreak that hit the southwestern Yukon during and after 1994 and affected 1 study site much more than the other.

J	Mataloni, G; Tesolín, G; Sacullo, F; Tell, G				Mataloni, G; Tesolín, G; Sacullo, F; Tell, G			Factors regulating summer phytoplankton in a highly eutrophic Antarctic lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lakes from Maritime Antarctica are regarded as systems generally inhabited by metazoan plankton capable of imposing a top-down control on the phytoplankton during short periods, while lakes from Continental Antarctica lacking these communities would be typically controlled by scarcity of nutrients, following a bottom-up model. Otero Lake is a highly eutrophic small lake located on the NW of the Antarctic Peninsula, which has no metazoan plankton. During summer 1996, we studied the density, composition and vertical distribution of the phytoplankton community of this lake with respect to various abiotic variables, yet our results demonstrated neither light nor nutrient limitation of the phytoplankton biomass. Densities of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNAN) and ciliates from three different size categories were also studied. Extremely low densities of HNAN (0-155 ind. ml(-1)) could be due to feeding competition by bacterivore nanociliates and/or predation by large ciliates. A summer bloom of the phytoflagellate Chlamydomonas aff. celerrima Pascher reached densities tenfold those of previous years (158.10(3) ind. ml(-1)), though apparently curtailed by a strong peak of large ciliates (107 ind. ml(-1)) which would heavily graze on PNAN (phototrophic nanoflagellates). Top-down control can thus occur in this lake during short periods of long hydrologic residence time.

J	Tufescu, MVA; Tufescu, TV				Tufescu, MVA; Tufescu, TV			Ratios of expected values (REX), a method for impact evaluation of thermal discharges on the fish community in the Pickering littoral waters of Lake Ontario	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Discharge effects on the fish community are assessed for the Pickering power station and a creek in the neighbourhood, located in littoral waters of the northern shore of Lake Ontario, Since the ambience is cold in spring and fall, when the main spawning migration takes place, any positive thermal variation is selected with preference by the onshore migrants. Our goal is to identify these effects when significant or, alternatively, the community richness reduction, and even the biological damage to fish. Ratio to Expected Values (REX) involves a comparison of the diversity indexes from locations under impact versus ambient samples, in order to identify the effect magnitude. To clear the background records of local effects, they were checked for outliers, which have been replaced based on missing-value techniques. Applying the method, the slight thermal increase of the creek discharge was found to produce a higher richness compared to station discharges, hence offering more attraction for onshore migrants. Despite the high attraction of station thermal plumes, the general result is negative, due to a process described here as ambiguous attraction. It is preliminarily identified as a fish attraction, due to favourable thermal conditions at the plume edges, followed by repulsion and fish exhaustion, due to low oxygen level and absence of spawning conditions for the attracted fish, further in the plume. The paper also introduces a new statistical approach of effect evaluation for significance, based on pair comparison of records in the suspected area versus background records.																			0018-8158					AUG 2	1996	328	1					75	83		10.1007/BF00016901	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00016901													WOS:A1996VG10300005

Various processes within the system affect its global response, usually measured at karst springs. Research conducted in caves provides a unique opportunity for in situ analysis of separate processes in karst underground. The aim of the present study was to research the water and air dynamics within a deep karst system. Air and water basic physical parameters across the Lukina jama-Trojama cave system (-1,431m) were continuously monitored during a 1-year period. Recorded hydrograph of the siphon lake at the bottom of the cave was used to interpret the characteristics of an unexplored phreatic/epiphreatic conduit network. Water origin in the siphon was determined based on temperature and electrical conductivity. Air temperature and humidity monitoring revealed a strong inflow of air of sub-zero temperature into the upper portion of the cave during winter. Cave passage morphology was interpreted as the main determinant of air dynamics, which caused ice to accumulate extensively in the upper portions of the cave and caused the temperature on the top of the homothermic zone to be significantly below the mean outside temperature. Air dynamics also lowered the temperature of water flowing through the cave vadose zone and feeding the phreatic zone of the massif. The pronounced temperature difference between the phreatic zone and the top of the homothermic zone probably contributed to the thermal gradient observed in the cave, which is steeper than in ice-free caves in the area. Our results enabled the development of a conceptual model that describes coupling between air and water dynamics in the cave system and its surroundings.					; Paar, Dalibor/O-4895-2019; Stroj, Andrej/O-6564-2019	Stroj, Andrej/0000-0001-9769-267X; Paar, Dalibor/0000-0003-2301-5048													0885-6087	1099-1085				FEB 15	2019	33	4					551	561		10.1002/hyp.13342	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13342													WOS:000458700900007
J	Strong, C; Liptak, J				Strong, Courtenay; Liptak, Jessica			Propagating Atmospheric Patterns Associated with Midwest Winter Precipitation	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												For winters over eastern North America, complex Hilbert empirical orthogonal function (HEOF) analysis was used to objectively identify propagating patterns in four atmospheric fields that have potential relevance to precipitation: jet stream-level wind speed, 850-hPa moisture transport (qv), temperature advection (TA), and vorticity advection (VA). A novel phase shift method was used to show the location where each propagating pattern was most correlated with Midwest precipitation, and each of the four phase-shifted HEOF patterns was compared to its respective high-precipitation composite view. The leading HEOFs of the three transport fields (qv, TA, and VA), which collectively represented the dynamics associated with a midlatitude cyclone, accounted for almost half of Midwest precipitation variability and were associated with lake effect snow when propagating downstream from the Midwest. Correlation and spectral analyses revealed how the propagating transport patterns were related to the Pacific-North American pattern and other teleconnections. The leading HEOF of jet stream-level wind speed, which represented the tendency for the jet stream to migrate equatorward over the study region during winter, accounted for only about 4% of Midwest daily precipitation variability. In contrast, the second HEOF of jet stream-level wind speed, which represented an eastward propagating trough dynamically consistent with a midlatitude cyclone, accounted for 16% of Midwest daily precipitation variability.																			1525-755X	1525-7541				AUG	2012	13	4					1371	1382		10.1175/JHM-D-11-0111.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-11-0111.1													WOS:000307906500014

Assessing the extent to which temporal changes in waterbird community composition are driven by either local, regional or global factors	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												Lough Neagh and Lough Beg Special Protection Area (SPA, hereafter Lough Neagh) is an important non-estuarine site in Britain and Ireland for overwintering wildfowl. Multivariate analysis of the winter counts showed a state-shift in the waterbird community following winter 2000/2001, mostly due to rapid declines in abundance (4657% declines in the mean mid-winter January counts between 19932000 and 20022009) of members of the diving duck guild (pochard Aythya ferina, tufted duck Aythya fuligula and goldeneye Bucephala clangula) and coot (Fulica atra), a submerged macrophyte feeder. Only pochard showed correlations between declines at Lough Neagh and those of overall species flyway population indices to suggest that global changes could contribute to declines at the site. However, indices from the Republic of Ireland showed no overall decline in the rest of Ireland. Tufted duck indices at the site were inversely related to indices in Great Britain. Lough Neagh goldeneye indices were positively correlated with indices in the Republic of Ireland and Great Britain, suggesting that short-stopping could contribute to declines at the site. Coot declines at Lough Neagh did not correlate with trends elsewhere, suggesting local factors involved in the decline. These analyses indicate that although there are potentially different explanations for the dramatic declines in these four waterbird species at this site, the simultaneous nature of the declines across two feeding guilds strongly suggest that local factors (such as loss of submerged macrophytes and benthic invertebrates) were involved. An assessment of the food supply, local disturbance and other factors at Lough Neagh is required to find an explanation for the observed adverse trends in wintering numbers of the affected species. This study highlights the potential of waterbird community structure to reflect the status of aquatic systems, but confirms the need to establish site-specific factors responsible for the observed changes in abundance of key waterbird species at a site.

Mild Little Ice Age and unprecedented recent warmth in an 1800 year lake sediment record from Svalbard	GEOLOGY												The Arctic region is subject to a great amplitude of climate variability and is currently undergoing large-scale changes due in part to anthropogenic global warming. Accurate projections of future change depend on anticipating the response of the Arctic climate system to forcing, and understanding how the response to human forcing will interact with natural climate variations. The Svalbard Archipelago occupies an important location for studying patterns and causes of Arctic climate variability; however, available paleoclimate records from Svalbard are of restricted use due to limitations of existing climate proxies. Here we present a sub-decadal- to multidecadal-scale record of summer temperature for the past 1800 yr from lake sediments of Kongressvatnet on West Spitsbergen, Svalbard, based on the first instrumental calibration of the alkenone paleothermometer. The age model for the High Arctic lake sediments is based on Pb-210, plutonium activity, and the first application of tephrochronology to lake sediments in this region. We find that the summer warmth of the past 50 yr recorded in both the instrumental and alkenone records was unmatched in West Spitsbergen in the course of the past 1800 yr, including during the Medieval Climate Anomaly, and that summers during the Little Ice Age (LIA) of the 18th and 19th centuries on Svalbard were not particularly cold, even though glaciers occupied their maximum Holocene extent. Our results suggest that increased wintertime precipitation, rather than cold temperatures, was responsible for LIA glaciations on Svalbard and that increased heat transport into the Arctic via the West Spitsbergen Current began ca. A.D. 1600.					; Bradley, Raymond/P-9358-2015	Roof, Steve/0000-0001-8729-0036; D'Andrea, William/0000-0003-0182-8857; Balascio, Nicholas/0000-0001-7106-3541													0091-7613	1943-2682				NOV	2012	40	11					1007	1010		10.1130/G33365.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/G33365.1													WOS:000310411000012

The Salt Spring Wash Basin is located within the hanging wall of a major detachment fault in the northern White Hills in northwest Arizona, the South Virgin-White Hills detachment fault. The basin is the focus of a detailed basin analysis designed to investigate its three-dimensional structural and stratigraphic evolution in order to determine how a major reentrant in the detachment fault formed. Geochronology and apatite fission-track thermochronology from other studies constrain movement on this detachment fault system to ca. 18-11 Ma, while our study suggests faulting from ca. 16.5 to 11 Ma. Salt Spring Wash Basin consists of variably tilted proximal rock avalanche and alluvial-fan deposits shed from uplifting hanging-wall and predominantly footwall blocks. The basinal strata were deformed during early to middle Miocene faulting on the detachment fault, normal faults, and a faulted rollover fold within the basin. New and existing 40Ar/39Ar ages on tilted volcanic tuffs and basalt lava flows within the basin strata constrain deposition of these deposits from 15.19 to 10.8 Ma. An apparent lag between the initiation of footwall uplift at 18-17 Ma (based on thermochronology) and basin subsidence at 16.5-16 Ma in the eastern Lake Mead region may be explained by the influences of preexisting paleotopography, or it may be an artifact of lack of exposure of the base of the basin. An early phase of faulting and basin sedimentation from 16.5-16 to 14.6 Ma generated the relief to produce a 500+-m-thick lower section of megabreccia (landslide) and conglomerate (debris flows). Salt Spring Wash Basin experienced relatively high sedimentation rates of 200-600 m/m.y. during its early history. A 14.64 Ma basalt lies at a facies change to 650 m of conglomerate of the middle sequence that was deposited in an alluvial-fan to braid-plain setting. Changes in basin geometry included the development of the reentrant in the northern Salt Spring Wash Basin with the rollover fold at its southern margin. The middle sequence records a significant decrease in sedimentation rates from hundreds of meters per million years to similar to 60-30 m/m.y., major facies changes, and decreased rate of uplift of footwall rocks. The upper sequence of the basin includes ca. 11-8 Ma basalts interbedded with conglomerate. The ca. 6 Ma lacustrine Hualapai Limestone caps the section and indicates a profound change in sedimentation. The history of the Salt Spring Wash Basin indicates that there was a step-over geometry in the detachment fault that was linked across the southern margin of the reentrant in the basin during deposition of the middle sequence. The Lake Mead region of northwest Arizona and southeast Nevada contains exceptional exposures of extensional basins and associated normal and strike-slip faults of mainly Miocene age. The Salt Spring Wash Basin is located within the hanging wall of a major detachment fault in the northern White Hills in northwest Arizona, the South Virgin-White Hills detachment fault. The basin is the focus of a detailed basin analysis designed to investigate its three-dimensional structural and stratigraphic evolution in order to determine how a major reentrant in the detachment fault formed. Geochronology and apatite fission-track thermochronology from other studies constrain movement on this detachment fault system to ca. 18-11 Ma, while our study suggests faulting from ca. 16.5 to 11 Ma. Salt Spring Wash Basin consists of variably tilted proximal rock avalanche and alluvial-fan deposits shed from uplifting hanging-wall and predominantly footwall blocks. The basinal strata were deformed during early to middle Miocene faulting on the detachment fault, normal faults, and a faulted rollover fold within the basin. New and existing 40Ar/39Ar ages on tilted volcanic tuffs and basalt lava flows within the basin strata constrain deposition of these deposits from 15.19 to 10.8 Ma.

Influence of repeated fertilization on forest ecosystems:: relative habitat use by snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE												This study was designed to test the hypothesis that large-scale precommercial thinning (PCT) and repeated fertilization of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) would enhance relative habitat use by snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus Erxleben) in managed stands. Study areas were located near Summerland, Kelowna, and Williams Lake in south-central British Columbia, Canada. Each study area had nine treatments: four pairs of stands thinned to densities of 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 stems/ha, with one stand of each pair fertilized five times at 2-year intervals, and an unthinned stand. Understory vegetation and relative habitat use by snowshoe hares were measured annually from 1999 to 2003, 6-10 years after the onset of treatments. Mean crown volume index of herbs was significantly higher in fertilized than unfertilized stands, but density had no effect. Shrub volume was not affected by either treatment. Mean crown volume index of trees was significantly greater in the fertilized and high-density stands. Mean total richness of vascular plants was significantly reduced by fertilization. Mean total structural diversity of vegetation was highest in the low-density stands but was not affected by fertilization. Relative habitat use by hares, based on fecal pellet counts, was highest in the 2000 stems/ha and unthinned stands in summer. This pattern also occurred in winter when hare use was higher in fertilized than unfertilized stands. Overall, fertilized 2000 stems/ha stands provided habitat for hares to a degree comparable with unthinned stands of lodgepole pine.																			0045-5067					SEP	2006	36	9					2080	2089		10.1139/X06-093	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X06-093													WOS:000241585000002

Eugene; Rabalais, Nancy N.; Justic, Dubravko			Gulf of Mexico hypoxia: Alternate states and a legacy	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												A 20+ year data set of the size of the hypoxic zone off the Louisiana-Texas coast is analyzed to reveal insights about what causes variation in the size of the hypoxic zone in summer, the accumulation of carbon storage in sediments, and pelagic and sediment oxygen demand. The results of models support the conclusion that some of this variation can be explained by a higher sedimentary oxygen demand, which may be larger than water column respiration rates in summer. Proxies for organic loading to sediments reveal that carbon losses continue after accumulation, and results from other studies indicate that sediment oxygen demand is directly related to surface water phytoplankton production, which has increased because of higher nutrient loading from the Mississippi River watershed. The potential size of the hypoxic zone for a given nitrogen load has increased as a result and has doubled from 1980 to 2000. The development of widespread hypoxia after the early 1980s and its consequences could therefore be considered a,, shift to an alternate ecosystem state The Action Plan for. Reducing Mitigating and Controlling Hypoxia in the Northern,, Gulf of Mexico goal of reducing the size of the hypoxic zone to an average of 5000 km(2) by 2015 becomes more difficult to achieve for every year there is no significant reduction in nutrient loading. The decisions made to reduce the size of the hypoxic zone must incorporate these nonlinear responses and, we think, err on the side of caution in assuming that existing management efforts are sufficient to restore water quality on this shelf. The legacy of a higher sediment respiratory demand following eutrophication should apply to other coastal systems.					; Turner, Robert/GQA-6087-2022	Justic, Dubravko/0000-0003-4843-437X; Rabalais, Nancy N./0000-0002-1514-837X													0013-936X	1520-5851				APR 1	2008	42	7					2323	2327		10.1021/es071617k	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es071617k								18504960					WOS:000254492800020

The lidar instrument was equipped with N-2-Raman and depolarization channels, enabling the retrieval of the 355-nm extinction-to-backscatter ratio (also called Lidar Ratio (LR)) and the linear Particle Depolarization Ratio (PDR) in the urban planetary boundary or residual layer over 11 cities. The optical properties of pollution particles were found to be homogeneous all along the journey: no longitude dependence was observed for the LR, with most values falling within the 67-96 sr range. There exists only a slight increase of PDR between cities in Europe and Russia, which we attribute to a higher fraction of coarse terrigenous particles lifted from bad-tarmac roads and unvegetated terrains, which resulted, for instance, in a +1.7% increase between the megalopolises of Paris and Moscow. A few lower LR values (38 to 50 sr) were encountered above two medium size Siberian cities and in an isolated plume, suggesting that the relative weight of terrigenous aerosols in the mix may increase in smaller cities. Space-borne observations from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), retrieved during summer 2013 above the same Russian cities, confirmed the prevalence of aerosols classified as "polluted dust". Finally, we encountered one special feature in the Russian aerosol mix as we observed with good confidence an unusual aerosol layer displaying both a very high LR (96 sr) and a very high PDR (20%), even though both features make it difficult to identify the aerosol type.					; Dieudonné, Elsa/AAS-9076-2021; Shang, Xiaoxia/Q-5864-2018	Totems, Julien/0000-0002-1038-455X; Chazette, Patrick/0000-0002-6230-2982; Shang, Xiaoxia/0000-0001-9762-6672; Dieudonne, Elsa/0000-0001-5320-243X														2072-4292				OCT	2017	9	10							978	10.3390/rs9100978	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs9100978													WOS:000414650600008

With the advent of Holocene climatic patterns, fresh water lakes formed in dune fields and the pollen rain preserved in these reservoirs provides a basis for the reconstruction of the monsoon history. This history shows maximum monsoon amounts in the early Holocene, with a roughly two-thirds decrease to the present, and salinization in Sub-Boreal time. There appears to have been long intervals of near complete desiccation in the last four millennia. The variability of the winter rains is especially pertinent to the past climate of regions to the far west of Rajasthan.																			1431-7125		3-540-61892-9				1997	49						465	473																WOS:000071377300019

The shape of the frontal knobs of males showed the dominance of the autochthonous species, A. salina. Artemia abundance and fecundity were assessed. Biometrics of A. salina stages were studied by comparing cyst size and body length. A. salina abundance displayed a clear seasonal and spatial variation. Abundance of live Artemia ranged between 0.25 x 10(3) and 1414 x 10(3) ind m(-3). The highest numbers were recorded in pond M3, as nauplii (771.8 x 10(3) ind m(-3) corresponding to 31.8 g m(-3)). This resulted from low male and female numbers (34 and 17 x 10(3) ind m(-3), respectively). Artemia cysts were predominant (92.96% of total Artemia), and grouped in small (216 mu m) and large (243 mu m) sized cysts, which correlated negatively with temperature (r = -0.4, N = 294, p < 0.01) and salinity (r = -0.39, N = 294, p < 0.01), and positively with female fecundity (r = 0.6, p < 0.05). The large (270 mu m) and small (216 mu m) cysts suggested the presence of also the species A. parthenogenetica and A. franciscana in the saltern, respectively. Fecundity showed a summer-autumn distribution that correlated significantly (-0.6 and -0.9, N = 35, p < 0.01) with both temperature and salinity. A. salina performed best in M2 (more than 80 cysts per brood), at about 200 g l(-1) and 26.8 degrees C, with gravid females representing 20%. A. salina from the Sfax solar saltern was unable to withstand extreme temperatures (35 degrees C), but tolerated extreme salinity (330 g l(-1)). Abundance, biometrics, and reproductive descriptors of A. salina appeared to be governed chiefly by temperature and salinity, the physical structure of the saltern, and food availability, such as the unicellular green alga, Dunaliella salina. Nauplii (mean length: 401 mu m) from small-sized cysts encountered in the saltern might be a valuable food source for hatcheries of some small-mouthed marine fish.

Kirk; Kinsey, Stacy			Sources, fate, and flux of geothermal solutes in the Yellowstone and Gardner Rivers, Yellowstone National Park, WY	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												The total discharge and thermal output from the numerous hydrothermal features in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) can be estimated from the chloride (Cl) flux in the Madison, Yellowstone, Falls, and Snake Rivers. Monitoring the Cl flux in these four major rivers provides a holistic view of the hydrothermal output from YNP and changes in the Cl flux may indicate changes in geothermal or magmatic activity. In this study, the source, fate, and flux of geothermal solutes in the Yellowstone River and Gardner Rivers were determined. Beginning in 2012, the fluxes of geothermal solutes, including Cl, were determined at monitoring sites in the Yellowstone and Gardner Rivers downstream of geothermal inputs within YNP. A method was developed using specific conductance as a surrogate measure for solute concentrations at these monitoring sites. Combining continuous (15-min) specific conductance and discharge data, Cl and other geothermal solute fluxes were determined and approximately 32% of the Cl flux exiting YNP is from the Yellowstone River watershed. Synoptic sampling of river water and discharge measurements were performed during low-flow conditions of September 2014 allowed for the determinations of geothermal solute sources and their downstream fate. Thus, the contribution of geothermal solutes from the various geothermal areas at the downstream monitoring sites was quantified. The thermal features draining into Yellowstone Lake account for 34% of the Cl flux at the Yellowstone River monitoring site which is located approximately 5 km north of YNP. The Gardner River, which captures geothermal water from Mammoth Hot Springs, is responsible for 22% of the Cl at the Yellowstone River monitoring site. Because the Yellowstone River watershed is large and contains numerous thermal areas, knowing the source and fate of geothermal solutes is import baseline information that can be used to identify future changes in thermal activity.

The field of palaeoclimatology has made major progress over the past 15 years during which a great number of high- and medium-resolution case studies were published, reconstructing climate change of the past millennia. In many parts of the world, regional data coverage has now reached a point which allows compiling palaeoclimate maps for well-defined time intervals. Here we present hydroclimatic trend maps for the MCA in Africa based on 99 published study locations. Key hydroclimatic proxy curves are visualized and compared in a series of 16 correlation panels. Proxy types are described and possible issues discussed. Based on the combined MCA dataset, temporal and spatial trends are interpreted and mapped out. Three areas have been identified in Africa in which rainfall seems to have increased during the MCA, namely Tunisia, western Sahel and the majority of southern Africa. At the same time, a reduction in precipitation occurred in the rest of Africa, comprising of NW and NE Africa, West Africa, Eastern Africa and the Winter Rainfall Zone of South Africa. MCA hydroclimate change in Africa appears to have been associated with characteristic phases of ocean cycles, as also supported by modern climate observations. Aridity in Morocco typically coincides with the positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), whilst increased rainfall in the western Sahel is often coupled to the positive phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). Reduction in rainfall in the region Gulf of Aden/southern Red Sea to Eastern Africa could be linked to a negative Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) or a derived long-term equivalent Indian Ocean cycle parameter. The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) appears to have been shifted pole-wards during the MCA, for both the January and July positions. MCA hydroclimate mapping revealed major data gaps in the Sahara, South Sudan, Somalia, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, northern Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Special efforts are needed to fill these gaps, e.g. through a dedicated structured research program in which new multiproxy datasets are created, based on the learnings from previous African MCA studies.

J	Macdonald, GM				Macdonald, Glen M.			Some Holocene palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental perspectives on Arctic/Subarctic climate warming and the IPCC 4th Assessment Report	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												The IPCC 4th Assessment Report(FAR)is considered in light of Holocene palaeo-records of Arctic and Subarctic land temperatures and the response of the boreal forest-tundra boundary to past and present warming. The palaeo-records appear to support and amplify some of the conclusions in FAR and raise questions about others. Comparison of the FAR estimates for late 21st-century warming with Arctic and Subarctic palaeoclimatic records suggests that anticipated future warming will be unprecedented compared to earlier Holocene warming including the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) and subsequent Medieval Warm Period (MWP). Annual warming and winter warming will likely be greater than during earlier periods in the Holocene, but summer temperatures projected by FAR may approximate or not far exceed the summer warming of the HTM. The geographically synchronous pattern of 21st-century warming projected by FAR will differ from the observed geographic variability in the timing of the HTM, particularly in the western Arctic. Further palaeo-record syntheses are required to fully delineate the similarities and differences between the HTM and the projected conditions of the 21 st century. In addition, palaeo-records suggest that the Arctic and Subarctic climate may be sensitive to relatively small changes in solar irradiance and understanding the potential effects of natural variations in irradiance on the future climate of the Arctic and Subarctic remains a question deserving further research. FAR mapped estimates of a significant northward displacement of boreal forest and woodland clue to warming imply that boreal forest or woodland will displace tundra as far north as the Arctic coastline by AD 2100. In Eurasia the estimated AD 2100 location of the tree line appears to approximate the HTM location. In North America an advance of forest to the coastline on the north slope of Alaska, central Canada and northern Quebec would far outdistance the relatively limited northward advances of boreal forest during the HTM. However, rates of tree species advance and subsequent forest development based on palaeo-records and Currently observed tree line advances raise questions about the likelihood that northward migration and subsequent increases in the population sizes of boreal tree species could occur rapidly enough to establish continuous forest and woodland as far north as the Arctic coastlines of Eurasia and North America by AD 2100. Determining potential rates of northward advance of the northern forests requires further ecological and palaeoecological investigations.

J	Salencon, MJ; Thebault, JM				Salencon, MJ; Thebault, JM			Simulation model of a mesotrophic reservoir (Lac de Pareloup, France): MELODIA, an ecosystem reservoir management model	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												A five-year research project on Pareloup Lake, an Electricite de France hydroelectric reservoir, increased present understanding of the dynamics of this ecosystem, in both biological and hydrodynamic terms. Simulation models were developed during the study with the aim of providing a tool for water management and decision making. The first phase, described in an earlier paper, was to elaborate the biological model (ASTER) which highlighted the dominant mechanisms in the evolution of the biological variables. The second phase, described here, was the elaboration of the MELODIA model. This model is the result of the coupling of the ASTER biological model with the vertical hydrodynamic and thermal model (EOLE) which had simultaneously been developed to simulate evolution in thermal stratification, taking energy exchanges across the air-water interface and through-flow into account. Considerable processing of data on inflow and its physico-chemical characteristics was required prior to development of this second model. The formulation of certain functions of the biological model, linked to its vertical structure, had to be changed: this was the case for sedimentation and the extinction coefficient. The sizeable data base available enabled calibration of the model and ensuring that it correctly simulated seasonal evolution of each of the variables, as well as their vertical dynamics, over the five-year period. Year-to-year fluctuations were equally well represented. The simulations pointed up the degree to which the ecosystem is sensitive to the hydrodynamic structure. Spring stratification conditions, directly linked to meteorological conditions and hydraulic management, determine the dynamics of the diatom population, essentially made up of Asterionella formosa. This species is not consumed by zooplankton, and disappears by sinking, trapping a large proportion of nutrients until winter isothermia. Because of this, the springtime diatoms in Pareloup play a key role in regulating the ecosystem. As the model was found to simulate well both stratification and the growth and sinking of diatoms, it will later be used to assess different reservoir management modes.																			0304-3800					JAN	1996	84	1-3					163	187		10.1016/0304-3800(94)00141-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3800(94)00141-3													WOS:A1996TP69300014

Commiss Remote Sens, Sun Yat-Sen Univ, Univ Swansea, Univ Nebraska, K C Wong Educ Fdn, Nat Sci Fdn				Bioavailable-phosphorus (BAP) fractions of the lake surface sediments (the upper 0-5cm depth) and environmental indicators of the related lake water column were investigated in five lakes in Lixia River basin during three seasons in order to evaluate the impacts of environmental indicators of the water column on the BAP fractions of surface sediments. The concentration of BAP varied significantly in different seasons. Factor analysis was used to identify the factors which influence sedimentary BAP significantly in the different seasons. The results showed that AAP and Olsen-P were significantly affected by the chemical oxygen demand through the bacterial activity in summer. The high intensity of bacterial activity and density of algae, and low concentrations of NO3-N and dissolved oxygen under high temperature enhanced the BAP released from anaerobic sediment and significantly contributed to the eutrophication of the lake, especially in summer. In addition, macrophyte roots were beneficial to absorption of AAP and Olsen-P.

The fundamental internal structure of the Echo Hills is an asymmetric anticline disrupted by reverse and oblique faulting. An analysis of the stress distribution within the stepover indicates that the interaction between the two segments of the Bitter Spring Valley fault is responsible for the compressive deformation and structural uplift in the Echo Hills. Given the number of strike-slip faults in the Basin and Range, similar examples of Tertiary uplift and shortening probably occur elsewhere within the province.

Pumpkinseed body size characteristics differed in the two lakes; Little Round Lake harbours a stunted population and Beloporine Lake does not. Age-class distribution of mature females was determined by a maturity assessment on fish collected just prior to spawning and at the mid-spawning period, combined with an early-season capture-mark-recapture survey. Spawning females were collected throughout the breeding season to assess age and size-related temporal trends, and to compare their age and size distribution with that of mature females at large. The proportion of age 2 females in Little Round Lake that actually spawned was considerably lower than the proportion of mature age 2 females at large. Furthermore, age 2 females that spawned in this lake did not do so until late in the breeding season. In contrast, the proportion of young/small females spawning in Beloporine Lake was comparable to the proportion of young/small mature females at large, and both small and large females spawned throughout the breeding season. Small mature females in Little Round Lake may have had no other option but to spawn late in the season because of their poor body condition. In Beloporine Lake, condition factor early in the breeding season in age 2-4 females was higher than that of Little Round Lake females, suggesting that limited energy reserves in the spring may have prevented young Little Round Lake females from early spawning. Our results show that the likelihood and timing of reproduction are both age and size-dependent in some populations. Small individuals that delay seasonal maturation and spawn late in the summer probably contribute little to the population due to the restricted growth and reduced overwinter survival of their progeny.																			0378-1909					FEB	1994	39	2					119	127		10.1007/BF00004929	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00004929													WOS:A1994MX38400003

Strong evidence for two disjunct populations of Black Scoters Melanitta americana in North America	WILDFOWL												Black Scoters Melanitta americana were marked with satellite transmitters on Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America to examine continental-scale population delineation. Scoters marked on the different coasts did not overlap at any stage of the annual cycle, suggesting that birds in the two regions could be monitored and managed as separate populations: 1) an Atlantic population, which winters along the Atlantic coast and Great Lakes and breeds from northeast continental Canada westward to the Northwest Territories, and 2) a Pacific population, which winters along the Pacific coasts of Alaska, British Columbia and the Pacific northwest states, and breeds in western Alaska. Range maps for Black Scoter could reflect these distributions revealed by satellite telemetry. Our data provide new information on the distribution of Black Scoters in North America, which can be used to improve the of future surveys.																			0954-6324	2052-6458					2021	71						179	192																WOS:000726039300011

For three consecutive summers. the lynx traversed a similar path in a northwesterly direction from the animal's home range in the Wyoming Range near Big Piney, Wyoming, to as far as the Henry's Lake Mountains, west of West Yellowstone, Montana. The longest travel distance was a minimum of 728 km during the summer of 2001. The male crossed several two-lane highways during his movements, including one highway that was crossed at least four times using the same general corridor between the Wyoming and Wind River Mountain Ranges.																			0029-344X	2161-9859				SPR	2005	79	2-3					196	201																WOS:000234115500012

The summer hydrology of a small upland tundra thaw lake: implications to lake drainage	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The phenomenon of thaw lake disappearance through rapid drainage has been identified as a potential issue for many circumpolar Arctic regions. These drainage events and the associated flood waves pose a considerable danger to human and animal habitat especially in lake-rich Arctic regions. The significance of this phenomenon is further heightened by the recent increase in human activity in Arctic regions, such as resource exploration, as well as the projected changes in climatic conditions for Arctic regions. This study is aimed at providing improved understanding of the hydrology of upland tundra thaw lakes, a type of lake that is prone to rapid drainage, by using a combination of observed and modelled data to calculate the complete summer lake water balance for a small thaw lake located to the cast of the Mackenzie delta in northwestern Canada. The lake level calculation is subsequently extended to provide a 32-year estimate of lake levels for the study lake. This long-term dataset is used to detect patterns and trends in peak summer lake levels. Furthermore, it is used together with climate data for the same time period to look at lake levels and climatic conditions at the time of known rapid lake drainage events. The results of the study suggest that while high lake levels are considered to be a contributing factor for rapid lake drainage, climatic conditions such as above-averaae summer air temperature and precipitation values also seem to be key factors. These findings are a first step in determining how projected future climate conditions might influence the rate of rapid lake drainages of Arctic tundra thaw lakes.

J	Mielko, C; Woo, MK				Mielko, C; Woo, MK			Snowmelt runoff processes in a headwater lake and its catchment, subarctic Canadian Shield	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES					62nd Eastern Snow Conference (ESC)	JUN 07-10, 2005	Waterloo, CANADA					During the snowmelt season, surface runoff into northern Canadian Shield lakes is governed by the distribution of snow and its ablation, storage in catchment slopes and valleys, and flow delivery from uplands, bottomlands and from upper lakes. For the lake studied, time lags exist between the commencement of snowmelt and the arrival of runoff to the lake, with evaporation from the uplands and bottomlands consuming some of the meltwater produced. Inflow from an upper lake is delayed. With all these inputs, the lake becomes flooded, first forming a moat, followed by an expansion of the open water areas, which are subject to evaporation loss. Lake outflow begins when water level rises above the outlet threshold. For the snowmelt season, outflow constitutes 40% of total melt and rainfall. The lake itself is a major storage that continues to maintain outflow until the lake level drops below the threshold in early summer, after which flow ceases. Snowmelt is the main period when runoff is generated from the headwater catchment to replenish storage depleted in the previous Summer, and to produce flow along the Shield valley that contains a chain of lakes.

J	Xia, YF; Xia, ZY; Yu, ZC				Xia, Yingfan; Xia, Zhengyu; Yu, Zicheng			A 1700-year peatland-based hydroclimate record from the Hengduan Mountains in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau reveals changing dynamics of the summer monsoon interface	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Indian summer monsoon (ISM) and the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) affect precipitation patterns across the broad Asian continent. The southern Hengduan Mountains region in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau is located at the ISM-EASM interface, but how these two monsoon systems affect long-term regional precipitation variability remains unclear. Here, we develop a 1700-year record of centennial-scale hydroclimate variability from a rarely reported Sphagnum-dominated subalpine peatland in the southern Hengduan Mountains, using Sphagnum-specific cellulose S13C and S18O proxies that are supported by characterization of modern proxy-environment relationships. Based on the modern variability of cellulose S13C and S18O in Sphagnum growth increments, we show that S13C is a reliable proxy for moisture availability, following the "water film" mechanism. In contrast, S18O is controlled by multiple mechanisms and can increase due to either higher precipitation S18O and stronger evaporative enrichment under drier conditions or increased plant use of evaporated pool water caused by pool expansion under wetter conditions. Using the time-varying S13C-S18O correlation as a constraint, we infer from our coupled cellulose S13C-S18O records several centennial-scale moisture shifts, including wet shifts during 700-1200 CE, 1500-1800 CE, and after 1950 CE, and dry shifts during 300-700 CE, 1200-1500 CE, and 1800-1950 CE, with a generally wetter Medieval Warm Period than the Little Ice Age. The temporal pattern is consistent with previously published regional pollen-climate records but shows disparities from those lake-based terrestrial input records. Based on our novel single-stem isotope analysis, we hypothesize that the latter might be additionally affected by changes in extreme event characteristics. We find that our new hydroclimate record shows an in-phase relationship with ISM records in the Indian subcontinent, except during 1500-1800 CE and in recent decades, during which our analysis presents evidence for an increased influence from EASM system. We attribute the transitions in large-scale hydroclimate patterns during these two periods to La Nina mean-state and anthropogenic radiative forcing, respectively, which weaken zonal wind flows over the Bay of Bengal-the key passage of the ISM. This study highlights the non-stationary relationship between hydroclimate and Asian summer monsoon dynamics at the ISM-EASM interface.

J	Hou, W; Gu, BH; Lin, QQ; Gu, JG; Han, BP				Hou, Wei; Gu, Binhe; Lin, Qiuqi; Gu, Jiguang; Han, Bo-Ping			Stable isotope composition of suspended particulate organic matter in twenty reservoirs from Guangdong, southern China: Implications for pelagic carbon and nitrogen cycling	WATER RESEARCH												We studied seasonal variations in the carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of particulate organic matter (POM) in the surface water of 20 man-made reservoirs in southern China during March, August and December 2010. These reservoirs are located from subtropical to tropical region, varied in trophic states and were influenced by several types of human activities. The geomorphometric and biogeochemical gradients in tropical subtropical regions are complicated and poorly understood because of low variation in temperature and high variation in hydrological processes. The POM samples were collected from all the reservoirs to assess the seasonal variation patterns of delta C-13(POM) and delta N-15(POM). Variation in delta C-13(POM) followed seasonal thermal and hydrological cycles. By contrast, delta N-15(POM) did not seasonally differ, which may have been complicated by phytoplankton assimilation of N originating in agricultural waste entering the reservoirs and of atmospheric nitrogen during the wet season as well as an increased relative contribution of animal waste in the reservoirs in the dry season. Within each sampling period, nutrient availability is more important than thermal and solar radiation inputs in the summer, and these physical drivers are more important during the dry and cold winter month in controlling delta C-13(POM) and delta N-15(POM). On an annual basis, trophic states (total P, total N and chlorophyll a) are the primary drivers for the changes in both delta C-13(POM) and delta N-15(POM) across reservoirs. When the seasonal effect is removed using annual averages from each reservoir, we found that latitude, trophic states, pH, rainfall, water temperature, reservoir age, catchment area to reservoir area (CA:RA) ratio and together explained about 80% of the variance in both Sitpom and delta N-15(POM). Our findings also suggest that the trend of SisNpom is less predictable than delta C-13(POM). The consistent N-15 depletion and enrichment of POM in different reservoirs point to the importance of different anthropogenic sources of nitrogen in the reservoirs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Water samples are collected seasonally from three monitored sites during 2011. The parameters used for assessing water quality and trophic status level include: water temperature, pH, EC, TDS, DO, BOD5, nutrients, Secchi disk transparency, and chlorophyll a. The results reveal that DO is above 5 mg.l(-1) in all sites, BOD5 value is within permissible level for domestic uses. Water quality considered as a hard type. High sulfate concentration is recorded during the study period. Trophic state shows that water type is classified as mesotrophic during autumn season, while it is regarded as eutrophic in other seasons. TDN/TDP ratio suggests that phosphorus is a limiting factor for algal growth. Based on IWQI, the water type is classified as excellent type for irrigation purpose.					; Shekha, Yahya/AEF-5945-2022	Toma, Janan Jabbar/0000-0003-4230-2261; Shekha, Yahya/0000-0003-4540-1222													2078-8665	2411-7986					2017	14	2					335	342		10.21123/bsj.2017.14.2.0335	http://dx.doi.org/10.21123/bsj.2017.14.2.0335													WOS:000459262900013

Spatial and temporal variability in mire pool limnology	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												The significance of mires (peat-accumulating wetlands) is increasingly being recognised internationally because of their susceptibility to climate change and their biodiversity values. Mires are best known in the Northern Hemisphere, but numerous examples occur in the South. The objectives of this study were to characterise physicochemical conditions in a representative mire in New Zealand, and to draw comparisons with similar environments elsewhere. We measured a suite of physical, chemical and nutrient variables over two full annual cycles in mire pools in a subalpine area. Seasonal variation in and temporal coherence of several chemical variables were inconsistent among pools, and this is explained by variation in water source and pool size. For most variables, temporal variability was at least as high as spatial variability. In comparison with peat-based wetlands in northern Europe, these New Zealand sites tended to have higher pH at given concentrations of Ca. Data from mire pools in other regions, including Tasmania and other parts of New Zealand, shared the same characteristics. Inter-Hemi spheric differences in rainfall chemistry may partly account for the pH differences, but low levels of organic acids (measured as DOC) appear more likely to be responsible. The mechanisms leading to low DOC are uncertain, but could include the effects of high rainfall, and vegetation differences. All pools were confirmed as ultra-oligotrophic in winter, though summer peaks in productivity exceeded thresholds for mesotrophic conditions. As in the Northern Hemisphere, nutrient patterns were independent of the Ca/pH gradient. Despite significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity of these mire pools, their average water chemistry also differs from that typical in rivers and lakes in New Zealand. Given that mire pools are already known to support higher proportions of endemism in benthic diatoms compared to other freshwater habitats in New Zealand, we suggest they may constitute an unusual environment type on which more detailed aquatic biological studies are warranted.

J	Helland, A; Åberg, G; Skei, J				Helland, A; Åberg, G; Skei, J			Source dependent behaviour of lead and organic matter in the Glomma estuary, SE Norway: evidence from isotope ratios	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Concentrations and isotope ratios of lead, organic carbon and nitrogen suggest that the Hvaler basin, SE Norway is more strongly influenced by inputs of atmospheric lead to the coastal current than by discharges from the river Glomma, while the Glomma estuary is affected by lead from the river Glomma. This difference was more pronounced in the early 1900s than in the 1970s. Simultaneously, the shallow Glomma estuary has experienced an increased marine influence in the sedimentary organic matter, interpreted to reflect an increased primary production caused by elevated nutrient input to the estuary. The inner part of the Glomma estuary is over the year dominated by terrestrial organic matter with low 613 C ratio while during spring snow melt the river bottom is resuspended and locally derived lead, atmospheric lead and organic matter deposited over the winter months are washed out into the estuary. Later the river plume withdraws to the inner estuary and atmospheric lead and marine organic matter becomes dominant in the outer part of the estuary. Anthropogenic lead enters the estuary as 'dissolved', and it is concluded that this lead is carried through the estuary associated to small particles, which settles in the outer estuary. Marine organic matter seems to be superior to terrestrial organic matter in this process of trapping river home anthropogenic lead by coagulation and aggregation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Starting in 2011, Microcystis continued to decrease, and each year, either filamentous cyanobacteria (Dolichospermum) or green algae (Mougeotia) took over as the dominant species. To understand the factors influencing this annual variation in dominant species, we observed changes from 2011 to 2016 and analyzed their relationships with environmental conditions. A general linear model was used to clarify the factors affecting the growth of Mougeotia and Dolichospermum. Dolichospermum biovolume showed a positive correlation with water temperature. Mougeotia biovolume exhibited a negative correlation with soluble reactive phosphorus, although it showed a positive correlation with nitrate. Principle component analysis indicated that increased nitrate resulting from high summer precipitation contributed to the development of Mougeotia biovolume. These findings suggest that, even after oligotrophication, phosphorus levels, water temperature, and water column stability remain crucial factors controlling the dominant summer species in Lake Suwa.

State, provincial, and tribal agencies in the basin supported the use of TFM and urged that the risk to nontarget organisms be minimized. To determine the response of riffle macroinvertebrate communities to repeated TFM treatments over several years, paired samples were taken at control and treatment sites during 1986 to 1995 on four Great Lakes tributaries: the Bois Brule, West Branch Whitefish, Boardman, and Sturgeon (tributary to Cheboygan River system) rivers. Macroinvertebrates were collected in spring and fall by a standard traveling kick method. The communities were described with several metrics, and general linear models were used to test for different patterns of response in the paired control and treatment sites. Relative abundance of the class Oligochaeta, relative abundance of the genus Ephemerella, the Bray-Curtis similarity index (at the taxonomic level of order), EPT genus richness (the number of genera in the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera), and total genus richness all increased more at the treatment sites than at the control sites after TFM application. The greater increase in abundance, similarity, and richness at the treatment sites was an indication of recovery in the treatment sites, where a short-term response to TFM was followed by a several-year rebound. TFM treatments in this study during the 1980s and 1990s had no long-lasting effects on riffle macroinvertebrate communities.																			0380-1330						2003	29			1			552	565		10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70516-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70516-4													WOS:000221321300043

We report palaeomagnetic measurements from 59 distinct volcanic units sampled at 98 sites in the TVZ. These are mainly rhyolitic ignimbrites and lava domes, with a few basaltic, andesitic, and dacitic lavas. Most have new K/Ar or 40Ar/39Ar ages. The remanent magnetizations are generally stable to both thermal and alternating-field demagnetization, and well-determined mean palaeodirections were obtained for all sites. Our findings suggest that the Taupo, Whakamaru, Maroa, Reporoa, Rotorua, and Okataina volcanic centres were magnetized during the Brunhes normal chron. Kapenga is an older volcanic centre, where activity commenced around 0.89 Ma and extended into the Brunhes. Mangakino volcanic centre is significantly older and was active from 1.6 to 0.95 Ma. Transitional or intermediate palaeodirections were obtained from Ahuroa ignimbrite (1.18 +/- 0.02 Ma) and Mamaku ignimbrite (0.22 +/- 0.01 Ma). The former almost certainly corresponds to the Cobb Mountain Event. The latter is significantly older than the Blake Event, and probably corresponds to the recently reported Pringle Falls/Summer Lake magnetic episode. Multiple sites from the Whakamaru ignimbrite have indistinguishable 40Ar/39Ar ages (0.33 +/- 0.01 Ma) and glass composition, but divergent palaeomagnetic directions.

The remanent magnetizations are generally stable to both thermal and alternating-field demagnetization, and well-determined mean palaeodirections were obtained for all sites. Our findings suggest that the Taupo, Whakamaru, Maroa, Reporoa, Rotorua, and Okataina volcanic centres were magnetized during the Brunhes normal chron. Kapenga is an older volcanic centre, where activity commenced around 0.89 Ma and extended into the Brunhes. Mangakino volcanic centre is significantly older and was active from 1.6 to 0.95 Ma. Transitional or intermediate palaeodirections were obtained from Ahuroa ignimbrite (1.18 +/- 0.02 Ma) and Mamaku ignimbrite (0.22 +/- 0.01 Ma). The former almost certainly corresponds to the Cobb Mountain Event. The latter is significantly older than the Blake Event, and probably corresponds to the recently reported Pringle Falls/Summer Lake magnetic episode. Multiple sites from the Whakamaru ignimbrite have indistinguishable 40Ar/39Ar ages (0.33 +/- 0.01 Ma) and glass composition, but divergent palaeomagnetic directions. This contrast suggests that either (1) the different sites were formed during a phase of extremely violent activity, lasting up to a few hundred years, during which geomagnetic secular variation was recorded; or (2) that they were formed in a single eruption, and rotation during subsequent extensional tectonism has caused divergence of the palaeodirections. 40Ar/39Ar ages of 0.77 +/- 0.03 Ma for the reversely magnetized Rahopeka ignimbrite and 0.71 +/- 0.06 Ma for the overlying normally magnetized Waiotapu ignimbrite bracket and constrain the age of the Matuyama-Brunhes transition.

Modeling seasonal onset of coastal ice	CLIMATIC CHANGE												To support regional management planning decisions, and to protect human health and safety, we developed a new statistical model that simulates the onset of seasonal ice cover along the shoreline of a US National Park (the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, or APIS). Our model encodes relationships between different modes of climate variability and regional ice cover from 1972 to 2015, and successfully simulates both the timing of ice onset and the probability that ice cover might form at all in a particular winter season. We simulate both of these endpoints using a novel combination of statistical hazard (or survival) and beta regression models. Our analysis of coastal ice cover along the APIS reinforces findings from previous research suggesting that the late 1990s signified a regime shift in climate conditions across North America. Before this period, coastal ice cover conditions at the APIS were often suitable for pedestrian access, while after this period coastal ice cover at the APIS has been highly variable. Our new model accommodates this regime shift, and provides a stepping stone towards a broad range of applications of similar models for supporting regional management decisions in light of evolving climate conditions.					; Rood, Richard/C-5611-2008	Gronewold, Andrew/0000-0002-3576-2529; 													0165-0009	1573-1480				MAY	2019	154	1-2					125	141		10.1007/s10584-019-02400-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-019-02400-1													WOS:000469017400008

The eastern side of the park had varying recession regardless of Lake Erie water-level changes, especially in Northeast Beach, where it averaged -3.14 m/y. The western side of the park generally exhibited accretion and had an inverse relationship with Lake Erie water levels. Longer duration of ice coverage during winter, favourable topography, and sedimentary conditions led to the observed difference in shoreline response. Future climate change patterns are expected to result in lower lake levels and less winter ice coverage, both of which will likely result in a net loss to the park's land habitat.																			0749-0208					SEP	2011	27	5					839	846		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-10-00160.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-10-00160.1													WOS:000294523800005

Wildlife Refuges Support High Bee Diversity on the Southern Great Plains	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												The native prairie of the southern Great Plains has been especially modified by two related forces: conversion of native prairie to agricultural forms of land use and removal of black-tailed prairie dogs (Rodentia: Sciuridae, Cynomys ludovicianus (Ord, 1815)) that act as ecosystem engineers via their burrowing and grazing activities. It is unknown how these changes have affected the native bee community. We surveyed the bee communities in relatively intact native prairie at two National Wildlife Refuges in Texas, quantifying bee community structure as a function of the presence/absence of grazing by prairie dogs. Over a 5-mo sampling period in spring-summer 2013, we found high overall bee diversity (180 species, mostly solitary ground-nesters), with differences detected in diversity between Muleshoe and Buffalo Lake National Wildlife Refuges as well as on and off prairie dog colonies. Although the same three species dominated the bee community at both refuges, most species were represented by relatively few individuals, leading to overall differences in diversity (richness, evenness, and effective number of species) by refuge. Bee diversity differed between sites on and off prairie dog colonies, but in trends that differed by refuge and by index, suggesting that location was more important than prairie dog presence.These results represent a reference fauna against which other regional bee communities in other land-cover types can be compared, but the high spatial heterogeneity we found indicates that detecting effects of landscape change on native bees will be challenging.

The geochemistry of upland ponds, Taylor Valley, Antarctica	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												The McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica are the largest ice-free region on the continent. These valleys contain numerous water bodies that receive seasonal melt from glaciers. For forty years, research emphasis has been placed on the larger water bodies, the permanent ice-covered lakes. We present results from the first study describing the geochemistry of ponds in the higher elevations of Taylor Valley. Unlike the lakes at lower elevations, the landscape on which these ponds lie is among the oldest in Taylor Valley. These upland ponds wax and wane in size depending on the local climatic conditions, and their ionic concentrations and isotopic composition vary annually depending on the amount of meltwater generated and their hydrologic connectivity. This study evaluates the impact of changes in summer climate on the chemistry of these ponds. Although pond chemistry reflects the initial meltwater chemistry, dissolution and chemical weathering within the stream channels, and possibly permafrost fluid input, the primary control is the dilution effect of glacier melt during warmer summers. These processes lead to differences in solute concentrations and ionic ratios between ponds, despite their nearby proximity. The change in size of these ponds over time has important consequences on their geochemical behaviour and potential to provide water and solutes to the subsurface.					; Doran, Peter/ABS-7911-2022	Gardner, Christopher/0000-0003-0400-3754; Welch, Kathleen/0000-0003-1028-3086													0954-1020	1365-2079				FEB	2012	24	1					3	14		10.1017/S0954102011000617	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954102011000617													WOS:000299936300002

F.			Modelling inorganic nitrogen in runoff: Seasonal dynamics at four European catchments as simulated by the MAGIC model	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Nitrogen (N) deposition is globally considered as a major threat to ecosystem functioning with important consequences for biodiversity, carbon sequestration and N retention. Lowered N retention as manifested by elevated concentrations of inorganic N in surface waters indicates ecosystem N saturation. Nitrate (NO3) concentrations in runoff from semi-natural catchments typically show an annual cycle, with low concentrations during the summer and high concentrations during the winter. Process-oriented catchment-scale biogeochemicalmodels provide tools for simulation and testing changes in surface water and soil chemistry in response to changes in sulphur (S) and N deposition and climate. Here we examine the ability of MAGIC to simulate the observed monthly as well as the long-term trends over 10-35 years of inorganic N concentrations in streamwaters from four monitored headwater catchments in Europe: Certovo Lake in the Czech Republic, Afon Gwy at Plynlimon, UK, Storgama, Norway and G2 NITREX at Gardsjon, Sweden. The balance between N inputs (mineralization + deposition) and microbial immobilization and plant uptake defined the seasonal pattern of NO3 leaching. N mineralization and N uptake were assumed to be governed by temperature, described by Q(10) functions. Seasonality in NO3 concentration and fluxes were satisfactorily reproduced at three sites (R-2 of predicted vs. modelled concentrations varied between 0.32 and 0.47 and for fluxes between 0.36 and 0.88). The model was less successful in reproducing the observed NO3 concentrations and fluxes at the experimental N addition site G2 NITREX (R-2 = 0.01 and R-2 = 0.19, respectively). In contrast to the three monitored sites, Gardsjon is in a state of change from a N-limited to N-rich ecosystem due to 20 years of experimental N addition. At Gardsjon the measured NO3 seasonal pattern did not follow typical annual cycle for reasons which are not well understood, and thus not simulated by the model. Capsule: The MAGIC model is able to simulate NO3 leaching on a monthly as well as an annual basis, and thus to reproduce the seasonal and short-term variations in N dynamics. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Quantifying gas ebullition with echosounder: the role of methane transport by bubbles in a medium-sized lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												In lakes and reservoirs with variable water level, gas ebullition can play a substantial role in methane transport in the water column and to the atmosphere. However, measuring methane ebullition from sediment is difficult as releases are highly heterogeneous and intermittent on macro- and micro-scales. In contrast to conventional gas traps and optical methods, hydroacoustic technology allows rapid scanning over large volumes of the water column synoptically to quantify gas bubble abundance. A 120-kHz dual beam downward-looking echosounder was used to measure the size distributions of bubbles that do not resonate at the sonar frequency. Data obtained with this sonar permit accurate calculation and evaluation of ebullition flux from the bottom. A robust relationship was established between gas volumes and backscattering cross-section of individual bubbles in experimental conditions, and rise velocities of bubbles were precisely measured. The volume backscattering coefficient was shown to be a good gauge of the total volume of bubbles per cubic meter of water, allowing the use of a single-beam sonar for measuring volumetric bubble concentrations. Data obtained from hydroacoustic surveys on Lake Kinneret, where gaseous methane is emitted from randomly dispersed sediment sources, indicated that similar to 90% of bubbles escaping from soft sediments ranged from 1.3 mm to 4.5 mm and similar to 50% ranged from 2.0 mm to 3.2 mm in equivalent radius. In summer-fall 2001, the gaseous methane fluxes from hypolimnetic sediments was similar to 10 mmol m(-2) d(-1), accounting for one-third of the observed methane accumulation in the hypolimnion. This relatively high ebullition rate could be attributed to the gradual decreasing of the mean water level in preceding years.

Plant macrofossils and stem encrustations, derived mainly from the species of P. pectinatus, M. spicatum and Chara spp., were identified, and they dominated the aquatic plant community of the lake. Alternations of plant macrofossils of Chara spp. and the vascular species reflect the changing productivity of the lake over time. In such a shallow lake, the carbonate content is highly related to photosynthesis of aquatic macrophytes and thus indirectly indicates variations in productivity, consistent with a quantitative estimate of palaeoproductivity. Based on these results, the palaeoproductivity history was reconstructed over the past ca. 16 ka. The lake was formed or recharged at 15.3 cal ka BP, as indicated by aeolian sand deposits at the core base. A marked increase in palaeoproductivity occurred from 15.3 to 11.6 cal ka BP. Between 11.6 and 9.2 cal ka BP, a sharply increased water-level, modulated probably by the enhanced Asian summer monsoon, might have exceeded the optimum water depth for macrophyte vegetation, causing a marked decline in coverage of aquatic macrophytes and low palaeoproductivity. The palaeoproductivity appeared to be high in the early stage of the period from 9.2 to 7.4 cal ka BP, and then decreased at approximately 8.6 cal ka BP. The palaeoproductivity sustained an overall high level between 7.4 and 2.1 cal ka BP, and decreased gradually since 2.1 cal ka BP. Our results suggest that the variability of Genggahai Lake palaeoproductivity may be associated with fluctuations of the lake level controlled by the strength of the Asian summer monsoon, probably indicating changes in the Asian summer monsoon.

Using NDVI from MODIS to Monitor Duckweed Bloom in Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Four summer time-series (2003-2006) of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from MODIS imagery were used to investigate duckweed blooms and other floating vegetation in Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela. Preliminary findings revealed the presence of duckweed and floating vegetation in the Lake during summer in varying amounts (0-11%) that appeared to be related to satellite-derived rainfall anomalies from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SMM/I) during the previous month. The first appearance of duckweed in abundance in 2004 and its reappearance at similar levels in 2006 may indicate a response to increasing nutrient loading in the lake. The duckweed rafts may be an environmental warning of imminent ecological disaster that needs to be mitigated. MODIS data, with its daily repeat cycle and 250 m pixels showed great potential for monitoring floating vegetation in the lake.

Diets of coots, Gadwalls (Anas strepera). American Wigeons (A. americana), and Redheads (Aythya americana) were studied in fall 1980. Arrivals and depatures of coots differed from those of waterfowl for all species, mainly because waterfowl migrated ahead of cold fronts and often diurnally, while coots migrated behind cold fronts and nocturnally. Significant positive correlations occurred between numbers of coots and numbers of Northern Shovelers (Anas clypeata). Gadwalls, American Wigeons, and Redheads on at least some lakes in most years. Waterfowl occurred in mixed flocks with low frequency. Gadwalls and American Wigeons were most frequently recorded with coots. Most ducks did not interact with coots in mixed flocks. Cooperative feeding and food robbery were the most frequently recorded behavioral interactions, especially between coots and Gadwalls or American Wigeons. Foods of coots and ducks were similar in most lakes and cosisted mostly of aquatic vegetation. Interspecific interactions between coots and ducks are minimal because of temporal and spatial segregation during migration, and behavioral interactions that are mostly neutral or beneficial to ducks.																			0043-5643					DEC	1985	97	4					463	472																WOS:A1985AXL5500005
J	Zhen, SC; Zhu, W				Zhen, Shucong; Zhu, Wei			Analysis of isotope tracing of domestic sewage sources in Taihu Lake-A case study of Meiliang Bay and Gonghu Bay	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Due to the difficulty of quantifying the temporal and spatial variations of the sewage sources of Taihu Lake, this paper collected water samples from Gonghu Bay and Meiliang Bay, in the northeast of Taihu Lake and from the inflow river of Wangyu River from January to December in 2012 and applied stable isotope techniques to trace the sources of the nitrogen pollutants. At the same time, a two-end-member mixing model of isotopes was used to determine the sources of domestic sewage. According to the results of nitrogen isotope values in the sampling points, the annual proportion of the sewage sources of the Meiliang Bay, Gonghu Bay and Wangyu River is 17.2%, 153% and 19.7%, respectively. More than 80% of the nitrogen pollution sources are from non-domestic sewage, which indicates that domestic sewage is not the primary source of nitrogen pollution in Taihu Lake. In addition, these three regions have demonstrated higher ratios of sewage sources during the winter season than during other seasons. Therefore, domestic sewage that flows into Taihu Lake during the winter season should be strictly limited. In the meantime, it is necessary to strengthen the treatment of nitrogen sources other than domestic sewage sources. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Favre, P; Jacomet, S				Favre, P; Jacomet, S			Branch wood from the lake shore settlements of Horgen Scheller, Switzerland: Evidence for economic specialization in the late Neolithic period	VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY												596 waterlogged, uncarbonized branch wood specimens from four cultural layers of the late Neolithic lake shore site of Horgen Scheller (between 3080 and 3030 B.C.) on Lake Zurich, Switzerland, were examined. The following parameters were analysed: taxonomy, diameter and age of the twigs, cutting season, and distribution of the branches over the area as well as their distribution in the different cultural layers. The twigs were divided into the following three groups, based on differences observed in these analyses: conifers, deciduous trees with catkins, and deciduous trees without catkins. Branch diameter examinations revealed that branches of deciduous trees were thicker on average than those of conifers. While branches from deciduous trees without catkins were gathered at the age of seven years on average, those of conifers and deciduous trees with catkins were older. Waney edge analyses showed that the majority of the twigs were cut within the winter months. Among the deciduous trees without catkins there is, however, a markedly higher proportion of branches cut in summer than in the other two groups. The taxonomic examinations demonstrated that 70% of the specimens consisted of twigs of either Corylus avellana L. (hazel), Taxus baccata L. (yew), or Abies alba Mill. (silver fir), thus implying the great economic importance of these species in the settlements of Horgen Scheller. To our knowledge this is the first report that a remarkably high proportion of yew twigs (26.8%) has been found in an analysis of subfossil twigs. The possibility is discussed that the inhabitants had specialized in obtaining yew from the region. Concentrations of wood finds, possible remains of buildings, became evident from the analyses of the distribution of the branch wood over the excavated area. A very similar spatial distribution pattern of the taxa was found through the different cultural layers. Therefore it seems likely that existing structures were reused when a new settlement was built. The data also show that the building outlines slowly moved towards land over time. A rising lake water level could have led to gradual dislocation of the settlements.																			0939-6314					OCT	1998	7	3					167	178		10.1007/BF01374005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01374005													WOS:000076808300005

Pigment analysis by chromatographic and spectrophotometric techniques and phase microscopy were used to reveal the structure and relative seasonal abundance of the populations. The predominant bacteria were identified as members of the genera Synechococcus, Chloronema, Chromatium and Thiopedia. Unidentified brown Chlorobiaceae also were present. Maximal development of the populations was found in late Aug. and Sept. The primary production, distribution of sulfide, O2 chlorophyllous pigments, ATP and temperature profiles were determined through the summer. Oxygenic (algal) and anoxygenic (bacterial) photosynthesis were distinguished by using the inhibitor DCMU. The phototrophic sulfur bacteria accounted for 3.9-17.5% of the total daily primary production. The contribution of bacterial photosynthesis to the total pelagic annual primary production of the lake was 3.6%. The main factors determining the growth of photosynthetic S bacteria in Lake Vechten are light and sulfide concentration.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1982	27	5					883	895		10.4319/lo.1982.27.5.0883	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1982.27.5.0883													WOS:A1982PJ17500008

Where high frequency and depth-resolved data exist, they can provide a wealth of knowledge about how lakes are responding to a changing climate. In this study, we analyzed around 950 profiles of summer mean water temperature (July to September), which includes about 30,600 unique observations, from a subarctic lake (Lake Konnevesi, Finland) to understand the changes in lake surface water temperature (LSWT), lake deepwater temperature (LDWT), and lake volumetrically weighted mean temperature (LVWMT) from 1984 to 2021. Statistical analysis of this dataset revealed a substantial warming of LSWT (0.41 degrees C decade(-1)) and LVWMT (0.32 degrees C decade(-1)), whilst LDWT remained unchanged (0.00 degrees C decade(-1)). Our analysis using a generalized additive model suggested the inter-annual variability in LSWT and LVWMT correlated significantly with the upward trends of summer mean air temperature and solar radiation, but suggested no significant effect of observed changes in ice departure dates and near-surface wind speed. None of the investigated predictors correlated with the change in the LDWT. Due to the variable response of lake surface and bottom water temperature to climate change in this subarctic lake, our data suggest a substantial increase in lake thermal stability. Our study supports the growing literature on lake thermal responses to climate change, and illustrates the unique contrast of climate change impacts at the surface and at depth in lake ecosystems, with deep waters acting as a potential thermal refuge to aquatic organisms within a warming world.					; Naderian, Danial/MDT-6007-2025; Maghrebi, Mohsen/ABB-9815-2021	Naderian, Danial/0000-0002-7028-7954; partani, sadegh/0000-0002-5712-371X; 													1574-9541	1878-0512				DEC	2023	78								102331	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2023.102331	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2023.102331		OCT 2023											WOS:001094814800001

According to the precipitation regime, the western part is 5 times richer in precipitation than the central part of the country. All of the 10 largest water springs are located in the western part of the country, spring area of river Vardar and river Crni Drim basin. The eastern part is much dryer, poor in spring waters and predominantly depends from the accumulated water in the dams. The most significant surface water resource is two lakes in the country Ohrid Lake (50.7 km(3)) and Prespa Lake (4.75 km(3)). The more organized managing of water resources started in the post war period in the 20th century with establishing Water Management Authority. With this public body largest irrigation systems were created in 50ies and more than 300 dams were built to keep the water obtained in the wet period and use it in the dry period of the year, mainly used for water supply of population, industry and agriculture. Today main managing body for country water resources is Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Water Management. Recently there is high demand for improvement of capacity, financials and human resources in this public body for better water management.

The pattern of a relatively strong ISM during the early to middle Holocene, and a relatively weak ISM in the late Holocene, has been widely demonstrated in both marine and continental records. However, the timing of the ISM onset during the early Holocene remains controversial. Here, we present oxygen isotope record from ostracods and hydrogen isotope record from sedimentary leaf waxes from a sediment core at Linggo Co, a glacier-fed lake on the central Tibetan Plateau, in order to investigate the onset of the ISM. The ostracod O-18 record indicates an early ISM onset at similar to 11.7 ka, whereas the leaf wax D record indicates a later ISM onset at similar to 10 ka. This apparent two-step development of the ISM revealed by aquatic and terrestrial records is confirmed by principal component analysis of nine marine records from the ISM domain. The comparison between isotope records from Linggo Co and the marine records implies that the early ISM onset was likely linked to elevated temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere, while the later ISM onset may be related to intensified precipitation.

Grass seed cropping systems are intensely managed with inorganic fertilizers to sustain production. Much of the land where grass seed production occurs in western Oregon is marginally productive for most other crops because of the poorly drained soil conditions. The role of riparian areas bordering grass seed fields in moderating surface water and groundwater quality is not well understood. A study sire in western Oregon was instrumented to determine how riparian areas bordering grass seed fields process N and thereby influence water quality. The site consisted of a perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) seed field, a riparian area, and an intermittent creek. Groundwater levels were monitored during the fall of 1995 to the late spring of 1996 and a complete set of samples were collected every two weeks from wells with water and analyzed for NO3(-) and NH4(+). Total fertilizer applied to the crop was 200 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), Data indicated a lateral subsurface hydrologic flow path from the cultivated field through the riparian zone, to the creek. Averaged over the season (November 1995 - June 1996), riparian zone A and C horizon groundwater mean NO3(-) concentration was mostly undetectable and less than 3.8 mg L-1 in the agricultural field. At all sampling concentration was higher in the field than in the riparian zone. Seasonal mean groundwater NH4(+) concentrations for the riparian and field A and C horizons were less than or equal to 0.2 mg L-1, Annual crop net N accumulation was 144 kg N ha(-1). Riparian soil electrode potentials (Eh) at 25 and 45 cm averaged -200 to -100 mV during the wet cycle, whereas the field ranged between 0 to +50 mV. Collectively, findings indicate that both crop and riparian processes at the Lake Creek site are responsible for reducing shallow groundwater NO3(-) to low levels.																			0038-0768					DEC	1997	43				SI		1025	1030																WOS:000072440600017
J	Yuan, YY				Yuan Yuying			Cultural evolution and spatial-temporal distribution of archaeological sites from 9.5-2.3 ka BP in the Yan-Liao region, China	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES												With basic information from 8353 archaeological sites, this study describes a holistic spatial-temporal distribution pattern of archaeological sites of the prehistoric culture sequence from 9.5 ka BP (ka BP = thousands of years before 0 BP, where 0 BP is defined as the year AD 1950) to 2.3 ka BP in the region that extends from the Yanshan Mountains to the Liaohe River Plain (i.e., the Yan-Liao region) in northern China. Based on spatial statistics analysis-including the spatial density of the sites and Geographic Information System nearest- neighbour analysis, combined with a review of environmental and climatic data-this paper analyses cultural evolution, the spatial-temporal features of the archaeological sites and human activities against the backdrop of climatic and environmental changes in this region. The results reveal that prehistoric cultural evolution in the Yan-Liao region is extensively influenced by climatic and environmental changes. The Xinglongwa, Zhaobaogou and Fuhe cultures, which primarily developed during a habitable period from 8.5 ka BP to 6.0 ka BP with strong summer monsoons, have similar maximum density values, spatial patterns and subsistence strategies dominated by hunting-gathering. Significant changes occurred in the Hongshan and Lower Xiajiadian cultures, with a significant increase in numbers and densities of sites and a slump in average nearest-neighbour ratio when the environment began to deteriorate starting in 6.0 ka BP. Additionally, with the onset of a weak summer monsoon and the predominance of primitive agriculture, sites of these two cultures present a different type of concentric circle-shaped pattern in space. As the environment continuously deteriorated with increasing aridity and the spread of steppe, more sites were distributed towards the south, and primitive agriculture was replaced by livestock husbandry in the Upper Xiajiadian culture. The most densely populated areas of the studied cultures are centralized within a limited area. The Laohahe River and Jiaolaihe River basins formed the core area in which most archaeological sites were distributed during the strong summer monsoon period and the first few thousand years of the weak summer monsoon period.

The massive appearance of both species of Enteromorpha in the lake was occurred mostly during early summer (June) with the position of the population in the water column ranged from benthic to floating. In the Nielba River E. intestinalis developed in May or June with maximum coverage in July or in the beginning of August. In both cases Enteromorpha preferred sunny places and well oxygenated waters. Additionally, it was found that in both habitats thallus was significantly higher at the end of the summer than at the beginning.																			1730-413X	1897-3191					2009	38			2			55	63																WOS:000276738000007

The closure plan foresees the construction of an artificial lake in the void left by the open pit. The open pit is 600 m long by 300 m wide, and has a maximum depth of about 100 m. Karstic springs hydraulically connected to the mine are located down-gradient of the open pit. It is planned that the future lake will be filled using the natural water resources available in the watershed. These water resources have been evaluated by means of a daily-based, lumped hydrologic balance model. The comparison between computed ground water discharges and the flow rates measured at La Respina Springs provide supportive evidence that it is a sound and reliable model. The outputs of the lumped hydrologic balance model have been used as boundary conditions for a finite element hydrogeologic numerical model of the aquifer. By combining the results of both models, a net inflow to the future lake between 2.87 and 3.25 Mm(3)/year has been predicted. The future lake will induce the water table to rise and therefore, the base flow of the karstic springs is expected to increase.

Characteristics of Sea-Effect Clouds and Precipitation Over the Sea of Japan Region as Observed by A-Train Satellites	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Prolific winter (December-January-February) snowfall occurs over northwest Japan due to frequent sea-effect precipitation that develops during cold-air outbreaks over the Sea of Japan (SOJ). Knowledge of sea-effect clouds and precipitation across the SOJ region has historically been constrained, however, by limited offshore in situ observations and remote-sensing limitations. This paper uses sensors from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s A-Train Satellite Constellation to examine winter sea-effect properties in the SOJ region. The analysis shows that cloud and precipitation occurrence generally increases across the SOJ from Asia to Japan, as potential sea-effect periods with an along-orbit mean sea surface to 850-hPa temperature difference 13 degrees C comprise a majority of the total clouds and precipitation. Sea-effect clouds and precipitation occur most frequently in an arc-shaped area that extends from the western SOJ, where the Japan-Sea Polar-Airmass Convergence Zone (JPCZ) is common, to the coast of Honshu, and then northward to Hokkaido. Radar, lidar, and column water path statistics along A-Train orbital tracks show that sea-effect precipitation is deepest along the central Honshu coast and becomes shallower but more frequent with northward extent. Precipitation amount and frequency maximize along the coast and adjacent mountains but decline with inland extent, most abruptly downstream of higher mountain barriers. This work illustrates that air-sea interactions, coastal geometry, and regional topography strongly modulate cloud and precipitation patterns during sea-effect periods in the SOJ region.

The organic matter (OM) in peat stores copious environmental information. Here we report new data on the organic geochemistry of a 4.5 m peat profile HY2014 from southern Zoige wetland. Based on closely spaced accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) C-14 dating, we established a high-resolution geochronological framework beginning at 14,057 a BP. Moreover, we estimated the sedimentation flux of TOC and TN (SFs) and their influencing factors. Before 10,916 a BP, the lake shrunk and peat began to develop under cold and dry conditions, and SFs were at their lowest values due to low productivity. More OM originated from hydrophyte and marsh plants. From 10,916 to 3050 a BP, peat was widely and well developed, and the climate was warm and humid, despite a cooling and drying trend. The HY2014 profile experienced an optimum climate during 10,91626000 a BP, when SFs had the highest values that benefited from high productivity, and OM mainly originated from terrestrial plants. After 3050 a BP, the climate was the coldest and driest. The high SFs over the past 2000 a BP were mainly resulted from the low decomposition rate. The plant community, primary productivity, and decomposition rate were closely linked with the temporal variation of SFs. The environment change was mainly controlled by summer solar insolation, and the Zoige wetland was significantly influenced by the Indian summer monsoon.

In different stages, the n-alkane homologues exhibited different distribution modes indicative of variations in the surrounding vegetation and the hydrologic condition of the lake. The n-alkanes proxies (CPI (h) , ACL (h) , P (aq) ) have the same trends as the summer solar insolation variation, implying that the summer insolation is the most important climatic factor driving the environmental changes and also indirectly controls lake evolution on the Tibetan Plateau. CPI (h) and ACL (h) as well as the total pollen concentration appear to show a trend comparable with methane concentration record from the GRIP ice core that reflected the Dansgaard-Oeschger events. This demonstrates that the paleoclimate variations in Qarhan area generally agree with global climate change and show rapid oscillations in late MIS3. These findings provide the latest molecular fossil evidence from paleolake sediments to confirm that lake evolution on Tibetan Plateau in late MIS3 was closely associated with enhanced summer insolation.

Groundwater conditions beneath beaches of Lake Huron, Ontario, Canada	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Groundwater flow conditions below beaches of Lake Huron have been examined at eight sites. Groundwater below beaches flows towards the lake throughout the year. However, water table conditions vary between beaches with a shallow water table (<1 m) and beaches with a deep water table (>2 m). Where the water table is deep, the water table across a beach will rise and fall proportionally to fluctuations in lake levels. The hydraulic gradient is essentially linear across a beach. Beaches with a shallow water table exhibit very little change in the elevation of the water table over time, do not fluctuate proportionally with lake level changes, and have a break in the hydraulic gradient at similar to 20 m from shore. Long term and season fluctuations in the surface of Lake Huron will change the elevation and location of the groundwater discharge area, resulting in the water table beneath the entire beach where the water table is deep to rise and fall proportionally and maintaining essentially the same hydraulic gradient. However, fluctuations in the lake levels have little impact on water table conditions at beaches where the water table is shallow.																			1463-4988						2009	12	4					444	455		10.1080/14634980903354825	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634980903354825													WOS:000273755800013

During this period, municipal phosphorus loading declined significantly. Since 1981, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations during deep lake mixing have decreased from approximately 3.0 to currently 1.6 mmol m-3 at a rate of 7% year-1. Nitrate concentrations, by contrast, continued to rise. During the period of maximum phosphorus loading, flushing through the outlet and sedimentation were about equally important sinks of phosphorus from the euphotic zone. Recently, however, sedimentation and subsequent burial of P in the bottom deposits contributed about three-quarters to the overall P-losses from the system. Main reasons for this shift are unchanged settling fluxes of phosphorus out of the euphotic zone and decreasing concentrations of total phosphorus in the water. Only during spring, do concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus within the euphotic zone decrease in proportion to the formation of particulate organic matter. Later during the season, euphotic SRP concentrations continue to be low but are no longer matched by high plankton biomass because phosphorus is efficiently removed by settling of particles. In spite of the observed dramatic decrease in phosphorus loading since 1980, chlorophyll concentrations and water transparency, as well as annual phytoplankton productivity (approximately 300 g C m-2), have not shown a consistent downward trend. However, the intensity of phosphorus regeneration within the euphotic zone, which can be used as a measure of the degree of nutrient limitation, is likely to have increased significantly. The most probable explanation for the insensitivity of important trophic state indicators to reduced nutrient loading is that, in Lake Constance, biomass accumulation to a greater extent is controlled by losses, mainly grazing by zooplankton and sedimentation, than by primary resources.

More than 98% of the Siberian crane population overwinters in Poyang lake area. Remote-sensing and the spatial analysis tools of geographic information system (GIS) technology were used to assess the suitability of the habitat for wintering Siberian cranes in Poyang lake area at different water levels. The results demonstrated that as the water level increased within the range of 7.93-12.16 m, the area of unsuitable habitat increased gradually, but the areas of good, fair and poor habitat decreased. When the water level reached 12.16 m, good habitat for Siberian cranes covered an area of only 3005 ha, which is only 0.93% of the area of the total lake area. When human disturbance factors including vehicles, fishing and construction activities were added to the analysis of the current distribution of Siberian crane habitat, the results again indicated that the area of good habitat decreased with an increase in water level within the range of 7.93-12.16 m. Additionally, the areas of good habitat occurred primarily in the region of two national nature reserves, which are the Poyang Lake National Nature Reserve and the Nanjishan National Nature Reserve. Our study provides important data and an important theoretical basis for water level management and nature reserve construction in Poyang lake area.					; Chen, Bing/HPH-1735-2023	lei, jun cheng/0000-0002-9180-7760; 													1505-2249						2016	64	1					84	97		10.3161/15052249PJE2016.64.1.008	http://dx.doi.org/10.3161/15052249PJE2016.64.1.008													WOS:000373314100008
J	Pratt, TC; Fox, MG				Pratt, TC; Fox, MG			Influence of predation risk on the overwinter mortality and energetic relationships of young-of-year walleyes	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We investigated three potential mechanisms-size-dependent overwinter energy loss, size-specific predation, and size-dependent predator-induced metabolic costs-to determine the role of body size and predators on the overwinter survival and energy reserves of young-of-the-year walleyes Stizostedion vitreum. Walleyes were reared in outdoor hatchery ponds in Westport, Ontario, for three overwinter periods (1997-1998, 1998-1999, 1999-2000) in the presence or absence of predators (burbot Lota Iota or adult walleyes). Other young-of-the-year fishes were provided as potential prey items. We predicted that ( 1) smaller individuals of a young-of-the-year walleye cohort would have lower prewinter energy stocks and would deplete them at a higher rate; (2) no size-dependent overwinter survival would occur in walleyes reared without predators; and (3) physiological stress, in combination with size-selective predation on smaller individuals, would lead to size-dependent overwinter mortality in young of the year reared with predators. Prediction I was not supported by lipid, protein, or specific-energy content data; indeed, smaller walleyes actually gained energy over the winter, whereas larger walleyes lost energy. Prediction 2 was supported but prediction 3 was not, as no significant survival differences were observed between four size-class quartiles in any pond or year. However, young-of-the-year walleyes reared over winter in the presence of predators lost significantly more weight and energy and had significantly lower lipid concentrations at the end of winter than did those reared in the absence of predators. Although no differences in overwinter survivorship were detected between young-of-the-year walleyes reared in predator and predator-free ponds, the presence of significant predator-induced energetic costs in the absence of size-selective mortality suggests that the size-selective mortality observed in some natural walleye populations is the direct effect of the presence of predators.

Located in the northwestern portion of Victoria, Australia, Lake Tyrrell is a large playa that serves as a major discharge zone of regional groundwater. The chemistry of the regional groundwater is unique, having salinities of approximately 30 g l(-1) and pH values as low as 2.8. As the regional groundwater is discharged along the western edge of the playa in the 'spring zone', it is evapo-concentrated into a dense brine which sinks through the playa sediments, Macumber's pioneering work on the geohydrology of this region established that this denser, 'reflux' brine below the playa surface has evolved from the evaporation of regional groundwaters. We have measured the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio of a number of groundwater samples taken at shallow depths along the spring zone at the playa edge and compared them with the regional groundwaters and the reflux brine. Our data reveal a rather complex pattern of mixing of the various water masses associated with the playa system, most probably the result of density driven convective plumes. Two types of regional groundwater can be identified based on their Sr-87/Sr-86 values, with groundwater from the south being less radiogenic than that flowing from the north (i.e. 0.7108 vs. 0.7142). Vertical variations in Sr-87/Sr-86 in the regional groundwaters observed in wells adjacent to the spring zone can also be identified along a vertical gradient in the spring zone, Besides the hydrogeological information provided by these measurements, the strontium isotope variations allow us to evaluate the source of strontium to these waters. The regional groundwaters south of the lake are very similar in Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio to the reflux brines, whereas the northern regional groundwaters are comparatively enriched in Sr-87. This enhanced Sr-87 signature indicates the addition of Sr along the flow path via the weathering of the aquifer material, the Miocene Parilla Sand. The southern waters have Sr-87/Sr-86 values closer to that of present-day seawater and/or Miocene seawater, indicating that the major source of Sr to the system is from one or both of these sources. Our results demonstrate that strontium isotopes can be extremely useful in studying the dynamics as well as the geochemistry of surface-water-groundwater interactions.																			0022-1694					MAY	1995	167	1-4					225	239		10.1016/0022-1694(94)02601-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(94)02601-7													WOS:A1995QQ22700013

JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												In the 15 years following the last crisis of phreatic type in 1975-77, the hydrothermal and seismic activity of La Soufriere de Guadeloupe has displayed an episodic behavior superimposed on a long-term decay, as inferred from seismicity and degassing, monitored through fumarolic emissions and Cl content in thermal springs. In particular, the evolution of the Cl content can be explained by a succession of magmatic gas injections into the hydrothermal system. This episodic supply of gas may be associated to the thermodynamic evolution of a batch of magma intruded at shallow depth around 1976. Progressive magma cooling, crystallization, gas exsolution and pressure buildup lead to cyclic failure of host rock around the intrusion, and episodic release of gas, with a decreasing frequency as cooling proceeds. This physical model allows to reproduce the pattern of degassing activity of La Soufriere, including the decreasing frequency of Cl pulses with time. Our preferred forward model of Cl pulses involves a magma intrusion volume in the range 0.01-0.52 km(3) and a tensile strength of the surrounding rock in the range 0.1-0.6 MPa. These results reinforce the hypothesis of a shallow magma intrusion triggering the 1975-77 crisis and provide an explanation for the degassing and seismic activities observed until 1992.

J	CHAMPEAU, A				CHAMPEAU, A			HYDROELECTRIC RESERVOIRS OF VERDON - IMPACT ON THE RIVER, CONSEQUENCES OF HEAVY WINTER DRAWDOWN	BULLETIN D ECOLOGIE												The flow of the Verdon, a river of southeastern France, is artificially controlled by 5 hydroelectric systems with differing characteristics which divide its course into 3 sections, the unharnessed Upper Verdon, the Middle Verdon submitted to a low flow regime and the Lower Verdon with a reserved flow. A study of 17 abiotic factors, periphyton diatoms, Ephemera larvae, crustaceans, hydrocarinas and fishes showed that the communities in the harnessed section are poor and banal, that certain animal groups are eliminated whereas some are favored and others disturbed. The blockage regime is most of all prejudicial to population density and the reserved flow to specific diversity. Substrate instability, repeated and sudden changes in flow velocity caused by lockages are prejudicial to trout reproduction. Mud streams produced by decennial reservoir draining caused the death of benthic invertebrates and fishes several miles downstream. The study of 16 physical and chemical parameters, of phytoplankton, zoobenthos, zooplankton and fishes in the reservoirs has shown that the marked level draw-down during winter involves a heavy increase of water volume, uncovering a wide belt of bare sludge. This does not seem to notably affect the pelagic communities of such monomictic and oligotrophic lakes. Their biocenosis is nevertheless impoverished by the swift water turnover which is unfavorable to planktonic life. Although the zoobenthos tolerates several months of winter emersion at reduced activity, its specific diversity is low. The lack of fixed vegetation in the littoral area, which is poorly represented, is a characteristic of artificial lakes. Measures are being discussed to limit prejudices caused by level subsidence in winter, decennial draining, lockage and reserved flow.																			0395-7217						1982	13	2					203	239																WOS:A1982PU90900007

This impact may be pronounced in the reservoir with less velocity of water during the charging period resulted in the deposition of sediments. In sediments on favorable conditions, methylation may be enhanced by the decomposition of flood organic material, which can release Hg and enhance microbial activity. However, much less is known about the transfer ratio of Hg and its form MeHg from sediment to biota in the hydrological reservoir during the dam charging phase. The objective of our study was to understand the interrelationship between total Hg and MeHg in two key components sediment and fish in the reservoir ecosystem. This study was performed at the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) located on upstream of the Yangtze River in China. At the TGR charging phase, during winter time, the water level was high due to blockade of water by Three Gorges Dam (TGD). Sediment and fish samples were collected in winter season for total Hg, MeHg, and several ancillary parameters. The results showed that total Hg in sediment samples of the winter season were ranged from 6.2 +/- 0.001 to 193.3 +/- 0.001 x 10(-3) mg/kg, with an average value of 53.76 +/- 51.80 x 10(-3) mg/kg, and for MeHg was ranged from 12.1 +/- 0.04 to 348.7 +/- 0.16 x 10(-2) ng/g, with an average value of 98.96 +/- 93.07 x 10(-2) ng/g. Total Hg and MeHg in fish samples of the winter season were from 42.48 +/- 6.71 to 166 +/- 52.56 ng/g, with an average value of 76.22 +/- 31.23 ng/g, and from 21.09 +/- 2.31 to 61.60 +/- 13.30 ng/g, with an average value of 37.89 +/- 11.96 ng/g. The relationship of total Hg and MeHg concentrations in fish to those of sediments from corresponding sites showed a negative relationship. This might include a strong association of total Hg with an inorganic component of sediment (e.g., bound to sulfides or coprecipitated with other metal oxides such as manganese and iron). The average concentration of fish MeHg found in this study, at rates greater than 1.72 g/day, was estimated hazardous to human health. This study concludes sediment was acting as sequestrate for total Hg and MeHg in TGR. The bioaccumulation of total Hg and MeHg in fish was not controlled by sediment further investigation about pathological routes and dietary habits of fish needed to be identified for total Hg and MeHg study in TGR.					; Wu, Shengjun/G-4942-2012; Mangwandi, Chirangano/H-2595-2014	Mangwandi, Dr Chirangano/0000-0002-6883-1367; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				OCT	2020	27	29					37099	37113		10.1007/s11356-020-08935-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-08935-6		JUN 2020						32577982					WOS:000542535400003

The results indicate that Honghu is a naturally-dammed feature, formed about 3000 years ago by meandering of the Changjiang river. Lake level then fell in the period after 2500 BP, but during the Jin epoch (265-420 AD) it recovered, only to fall once more after the Song dynasty (969-1279 AD).

This relative constancy is due to continuous sunlight, optical filtering through the 4.2 m ice cap and an absence of vertical mixing. The effects of this unique light environment on the structure and function of the photosynthetic apparatus were studied using measurements of P-700 reaction center content and spectral variation in photosystem II (PSII) fluorescence kinetics. Light-induced absorbance change at both 700 nm and 810 nm was used to measure P-700 concentration. The average ratio of total Chl/P-700 was 743 (mel mol(-1)), with a range of 480 to 1,039. These ratios were low in comparison to previous studies of phytoplankton growing in low-light cultures or algae growing beneath Arctic sea ice. A sample from the deep (17 m) layer dominated by Chlamydomonas subcaudata was grown in enriched culture media. PSII fluorescence kinetics were measured on thylakoid preparations in the presence of DCMU under blue-green (481 nm) and red (660 nm) light. C. subcaudata utilized blue-green light for photosynthesis more efficiently than the photobiologically well characterized C. reinhardtii (strain CC-124). These results, together with pigment analyses, suggest that carotenoids in Lake Bonney phytoplankton are more important in light harvesting as opposed to photoprotection.

Boron accumulation in this set of evaporitic deposits is primarily in the form of reedmergnerite (NaBSi3O8). Although reedmergnerite can be found in each sub-environment of this alkaline saline lake, it may dominate in evaporite successions near the evapocenter. However, its distribution pattern and origins within the evaporite succession remain unclear. Through comprehensive analyses of a reedmergnerite-rich evaporite core section, we propose the following: (1) boron originates from volcanic ash and hot spring; (2) diagenetic processes within a hydrothermal environment involve replacement of sodium carbonates by loughlinite (Na2Mg3Si6O16 center dot 8H2O) fibers followed by crystallization of reedmernerite within loughlinite during contemporaneous diagenesis; (3) vertical distributions of reedmergnerite within evaporitic successions are controlled by episodic volcanic eruptions, hot spring ejections, and climatic cycles; and finally, (4) significant volumes of reedmergnerite occur within sodium carbonate successions due to multiple stages of volcanic eruptions and hot spring ejections. Therefore, the boron accumulations within the sodium carbonate successions in the Fengcheng Formation provide compelling evidence of deep sources contributing to the formation of chemical deposits in an alkaline saline lake environment. The accumulation of reedmergnerite can be regarded as a boron resource that formed specifically within this type of alkaline saline lake setting. Furthermore, the presence of laminated reedmergnerite and louglinite can serve as indicators for identifying episodic volcanic activities and hot spring occurrences, thereby providing a basis for assessing the environmental conditions during source rock formation in an evaporitic basin.																			0264-8172	1873-4073				APR	2025	174								107323	10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2025.107323	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2025.107323		FEB 2025											WOS:001426242700001

The area did not grab attention of researches because of its distance from the high way. Its length is 8.5 km and has 10-12 km(2) surface area approximately. Review of the ornithological and ecological studies carried out in previous years revealed that no information related to this area exists. As many as 137 bird species belonging to 39 families (2 of them are subspecies) were identified in the study area. Of these, 67 (48.9%) are migrant species (summer migrant), 50 (36.5%) are resident, 19 (13.87%) are winter visitors and 1 (0.73%) is transit migratory These species belong to different IUCN Red List Categories including; 2 (1.46%) species are critically endangered, 4 (2.9%) are endangered, 17 (12.4%) are vulnerable, 16 (11.68%) are near threatened, 88 (64.23%) are least concern, 3 (2.19%) are data deficient and 7 (5.1%) are not evaluated. According to Red Data Book List of Turkey, birds can be categorized as; A. 1.2. 12 (8.76%), A.2. 22 (16.05%), A.3. 38 (27.74%), A.3.1. 21 (15.33%), A.4. 14 (10.22%), A.5. 20 (14.6%), B.3. 3 (2.2%), B.3.1. 1 (0.73%), B.4. 3 (2.2%) and B.5. 3 (2.2%).

Without precipitation, pure mixing should lend to a nearly 100-fold supersaturation at 40 degrees C. Physicochemical precipitation is modified or even inhibited by the properties of biofilms, dependent on the extent of biofilm development and the current precipitation rate. Mucus substances (extracellular polymeric substances, EPS, e.g., of cyanobacteria) serve as effective Calf-buffers, thus preventing seed crystal nucleation even in a highly supersaturated macroenvironment. Carbonate is then preferentially precipitated in mucus-free areas such as empty diatom tests or voids. After the buffer capacity of the EPS is surpassed, precipitation is observed at the margins of mucus areas. Hydrocarbon biomarkers extracted from (1) a calcifying Phormidium-biofilm, (2) the stromatolitic carbonate below, and (3) a fossil 'tufa' of the Pleistocene pinnacles, indicate that the cyanobacterial primary producers have been subject to significant temporal changes in their species distribution. Accordingly, the species composition of cyanobacterial biofilms does not appear to be relevant for the formation of microbial carbonates in Pyramid Lake. The results demonstrate the crucial influence of mucus substances on carbonate precipitation in highly supersaturated natural environments. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	de la Croix, JF				de la Croix, Jeanne Feaux			Incarnating Water in Central Asia: Hydro-Relations Along a Transboundary River	WATER ALTERNATIVES-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL ON WATER POLITICS AND DEVELOPMENT												Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork as well as collaborative events with artists and policy makers in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan, I demonstrate how water concepts and forms of interaction are anchored in the particular water incarnations of springs, lakes, glaciers and big rivers. As main water arteries for the Aral Sea, the Naryn and Syr Darya Rivers are managed between shifting alliances of the farming interests, International Non-governmental Organisation (INGO) bodies and national agencies of four riparian states. These Central Asian rivers have been subject to big dam-building programmes since the mid-Soviet period, while international companies now mine on the glaciers of the Naryn headwaters. I analyse socionatural water relations on a spectrum of three 'incarnations': first, river water as an exploitable resource; second, enspirited springs and lakes; and third, glaciers as indexes of human wrongdoing. While the multiplicity of water relations has been documented in many parts of the world, the concept of water incarnations highlights their topographical anchoring. This Central Asian case further shows how this anchoring can support claims of national entitlement. Finally, this paper argues that the situated heterogeneity of water relations can make it difficult to connect them to more sustainable water relationships in the region.																			1965-0175					FEB	2021	14	1			SI		12	31																WOS:000616338400002

The influence of streams on nearshore water chemistry, Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Large lakes have characteristics, such as a spring thermal bar; nearshore offshore gradients of nutrients, sediment, and biota; and the development of a nearshore zone often chemically, biologically, and physically different from the offshore region, that are not commonly observed in smaller lakes. The research presented here focuses on the role of rivers affecting the cross margin transport of terrigenous materials delivered during the summer on nearshore waters of Lake Ontario. On the south shore of Lake Ontario, levels of chlorophyll, total phosphorus (TP), and total coliform were higher in the Oak Orchard Creek river plume than out of it. Similarly at the Genesee River polygon, turbidity, specific conductance, temperature, TP, and chlorophyll were substantially higher in the plumes than outside of the plumes. Graphic depictions and the strong correlations (r>=0.70) between specific conductance and TP, soluble reactive phosphorus, temperature, chlorophyll, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, and turbidity indicate the plumes of water are from the Genesee River and Oak Orchard Creek. The load from all creeks on the New York shore of Lake Ontario ranged from similar to 18 to 25% of the annual phosphorus load of the Niagara River. The cumulative impact of these small streams entering the nearshore and embayments of Lake Ontario is potentially great, as the mixing of plume and lake water appears to be limited to the nearshore areas. Terrigenous inputs likely provide the nutrient, phosphorus, which contributes to the periodic development of benthic algae blooms observed along the south shore of Lake Ontario. The conclusion that river plumes impact and sustain the nearshore of large lakes is suggested by the data. (C) 2012 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Logging, pollution, and overfishing have caused dramatic population declines or local extinction of most stocks. Most of what is known about this species has been published in eastern journals and therefore is not readily available to western scientists. New data collected during the 1980s and 1990s have been combined with other reports to provide an overview of the biology and life history of this species. Taimen are long-lived fish and can reach ages of 29 years and sizes rtp to 60 kg. populations can either be strictly riverine or anadromous. Adults from both life histories ascend rivers in spring to spawn and feed, and less extensive migrations occur in fall to prey on spawning omul (Coregonus autumnalis migratorius). Principal food items for age I and 2 taimen are macroinvertebrates, but young taimen quickly become piscivorous at age 2 when they consume mainly black Baikal grayling (Thymallus arcticus baicalensis), and sculpins (Paracottus kneri, Cottus kessleri). Males reach sexual maturity at ages 7 to 8 and later for females at ages 8 to 9. Average egg production per female was about 22,000 eggs. parasite burdens are heavy but composed of few species and mediated by prey items consumed. This fish is a highly-specialized predator and plays an indispensable role in the structure of fish communities in mountains and foothills. Taimen conservation in the Baikal region is impossible without adoption and implementation of a dedicated rehabilitation program that includes the protection of remaining populations and habitat, and possibly introduction of hatchery-reared fish in selected areas where habitat remains, but parental stocks are low.

J	Xu, XH; Yang, XS; Miller, DR; Helble, JJ; Carley, RJ				Xu, XH; Yang, XS; Miller, DR; Helble, JJ; Carley, RJ			A regional scale modeling study of atmospheric transport and transformation of mercury. I. Model development and evaluation	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												A three-dimensional regional scale air quality model was developed to study the atmospheric transport, transformation and deposition of mercury (Hg) by formulating and incorporating mercury chemistry, cloud processes, and air-surface exchanges into the framework of Sarmap Air Quality Model (SAQM). Three mercury species were included: elemental mercury Hg(O), divalent mercury Hg(II), and particulate mercury Hg(p). Precipitating clouds, co-existing non-precipitating clouds, and fair weather clouds were considered in modeling the in-cloud transformation processes. A formulation of bi-directional air-surface exchange of elemental mercury was used for emission from, and dry deposition to, natural surfaces. Preliminary evaluation of the model was conducted by comparing six major weekly output variables, including ambient Hg concentrations and Hg concentration in precipitation, with corresponding measurements at eight monitoring stations in Connecticut for a summer week and a winter week. Model predictions of surface-level gaseous Hg concentrations were close to measured levels, agreeing to within 12% on average, about half the estimated error in measurements. The predicted Hg concentrations in precipitation were 50% higher than measured values on average, slightly lower than the estimated 60% error in measurements. The model was shown to be capable of predicting hourly concentrations and deposition fields of the three tig species as well as in-cloud transformation of Hg(O) by each of the three cloud types, and useful in analyzing the effects of various controlling factors on the transport and transformation of Hg species in the atmosphere.

Therefore, alternative methods of treatment are considered. Studies of recent years have focused on finding new biologically active compounds that may be effective against drug-resistant cells. High biodiversity of hard-to-reach environments offers sources to search for novel molecules potentially applicable for medical purposes. In this review article, we summarize and discuss compounds produced by microorganisms from hot springs, glaciers, caves, underground lakes, marine ecosystems, and hydrothermal vents. Antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, anticancer, antiinflammatory, and antioxidant potential of these molecules are presented and discussed. We conclude that using compounds derived from microorganisms occurring in extreme environments might be considered in further studies on development of treatment procedures for diseases caused by drug-resistant cells.					; Bielańska, Patrycja/JVZ-9371-2024; Jaroszewicz, Weronika/ACZ-9778-2022; Wegrzyn, Grzegorz/AAL-1179-2020; Grabowski, Łukasz/HKO-5880-2023	Bielanska, Patrycja/0000-0002-7745-4532; Zabinska, Magdalena/0000-0003-4758-1394; Lorenc, Patryk/0000-0002-4511-2474; Jaroszewicz, Weronika/0000-0003-0294-8682; Pierzynowska, Karolina/0000-0003-3634-6567; Grabowski, Lukasz/0000-0003-3746-8726; Gaffke, Lidia/0000-0002-0820-7204														1734-154X					2021	68	4					565	574		10.18388/abp.2020_5887	http://dx.doi.org/10.18388/abp.2020_5887		SEP 2021						34536268					WOS:000702834300001

In this study, element geochemistry and grain size of the sediment sequence from a dam section in Ganggongling (GGL) reveal crucial aspects of sedimentary dynamics, environmental evolution, human activities, and East Asian Summer Monsoon(EASM) variation in the Liangzhu area since 5500 a. Starting from the middle-to-late Holocene, the GGL section shows an overall transition from warm humidity to cold-dry, which is consistent with the climate record dimension in southern China. Through comprehensive analysis of the sedimentary environment before and after the dam's completion, it can be found that the Ganggongling dam has played a positive role in regulating mountain torrents and met the needs of production and domestic water, such as rice planting through water storage. Further applications on the multi-decadal to centennial time scale demonstrate that variations in solar activity may control the EASM intensity mainly in southern China, which is subject to ENSO intensity changes.																				2296-7745				JUN 9	2022	9								910125	10.3389/fmars.2022.910125	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2022.910125													WOS:000814954600001
J	Fennel, K; Collier, R; Larson, G; Crawford, G; Boss, E				Fennel, Katja; Collier, Robert; Larson, Gary; Crawford, Greg; Boss, Emmanuel			Seasonal nutrient and plankton dynamics in a physical-biological model of Crater Lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												A coupled 1D physical-biological model of Crater Lake is presented. The model simulates the seasonal evolution of two functional phytoplankton groups, total chlorophyll, and zooplankton in good quantitative agreement with observations from a 10-year monitoring study. During the stratified period in summer and early fall the model displays a marked vertical structure: the phytoplankton biomass of the functional group 1, which represents diatoms and dinoflagellates, has its highest concentration in the upper 40 m; the phytoplankton biomass of group 2, which represents chlorophyta, chrysophyta, cryptomonads and cyanobacteria, has its highest concentrations between 50 and 80 m, and phytoplankton chlorophyll has its maximum at 120 m depth. A similar vertical structure is a reoccurring feature in the available data. In the model the key process allowing a vertical separation between biomass and chlorophyll is photoacclimation. Vertical light attenuation (i.e., water clarity) and the physiological ability of phytoplankton to increase their cellular chlorophyll-to-biomass ratio are ultimately determining the location of the chlorophyll maximum. The location of the particle maxima on the other hand is determined by the balance between growth and losses and occurs where growth and losses equal. The vertical particle flux simulated by our model agrees well with flux measurements from a sediment trap. This motivated us to revisit a previously published study by Dymond et al. (1996). Dymond et al. used a box model to estimate the vertical particle flux and found a discrepancy by a factor 2.5-10 between their model-derived flux and measured fluxes from a sediment trap. Their box model neglected the exchange flux of dissolved and suspended organic matter, which, as our model and available data suggests is significant for the vertical exchange of nitrogen. Adjustment of Dymond et al.'s assumptions to account for dissolved and suspended nitrogen yields a flux estimate that is consistent with sediment trap measurements and our model.

At 121 sites we recorded 35 taxa (22 recent, 13 sub-recent), of which 23 represent new records for the province. According to the Index of Dispersion and d-statistics, the individual species exhibited clumped distributions. Cosmopolitan species dominated (63.64%). A direct effect of regional factors (e.g., elevation) was not observed, while local factors (e.g., water temperature) best explained species distribution among habitats. Based on alpha diversity values, natural habitats (springs, ponds, creeks) were more suitable than artificial habitats (e.g., troughs, dams), suggesting that natural habitats define regional species diversity. Twenty-two of the recorded species had wider ecological ranges than previously reported. Cosmopolitan species appeared to suppress non-cosmopolitan species due to their wider ecological range.

The boron is enriched in concentrated brine at the same concentration factor with the brine. The concentration factor of lithium is the same as that of the brine at the early evaporating process before the brine is concentrated to 4 times, and it is much lower than that of the brine because of the crystallization of lithium in the late process.

J	Galloway, JM; Lenny, AM; Cumming, BF				Galloway, Jennifer M.; Lenny, Adam M.; Cumming, Brian F.			Hydrological change in the central interior of British Columbia, Canada: diatom and pollen evidence of millennial-to-centennial scale change over the Holocene	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Diatom-based inferences of post-glacial hydrological change from a sedimentary record from Felker Lake, British Columbia, show millennial-scale pacing of climate over the past approximately 11670 calendar years with change at ca. 8140 cal. year BP, ca. 6840 cal. year BP, ca. 5700 cal. year BP, and ca. 2230 cal. year BP. Early postglacial diatom assemblages are dominated by fragilaroid taxa, suggesting that cool and moist climate conditions and relatively high lake levels prevailed at this time. Early Holocene warming near ca. 8140 cal. year BP promoted Cyclotella bodanica var. lemanica, a fall bloomer competitive in limnological conditions associated with warmer water and stratified conditions. Short-lived peaks of Stephanodiscus parvus/minutulus between ca. 6340 cal. year BP and ca. 5860 cal. year BP indicate periodic increases in nutrient availability and prolonged mixing likely associated with long cool and moist spring seasons. The diatom-inferred depth of Felker Lake increased during the mid-Holocene to reach a record high-stand at ca. 5860 cal. year BP. Large changes in hydrological variability and terrestrial vegetation at Felker Lake occurred after ca. 2230 cal. year BP when high-amplitude centennial-scale fluctuations in diatom-inferred lake depth and salinity are observed. Change is first documented in terrestrial vegetation at this time by a shift from open Pinus parklands to a landscape that periodically supported populations of Cupressaceae. Three record low-stand high-salinity events are reconstructed between ca. 1910 cal. year BP and ca. 1800 cal. year BP, ca. 1030 cal. year BP and ca. 690 cal. year BP, and ca. 250 cal. year BP and ca. 140 cal. year BP. The low lake-level episode of ca. 1030 cal. year BP-ca. 690 cal. year BP is coeval with the Medieval Warm Period (ca. 1000 cal. year BP-ca. 600 cal. year BP), a period of intense drought in western North America. Post-glacial hydrological change at Felker Lake is coherent with regional, hemispherical, and global paleoclimate events, suggesting that millennial-and centennial-scale shifts in water availability are a persistent feature of the climate of western North America.						galloway, jennifer/0000-0002-4548-6396													0921-2728	1573-0417				FEB	2011	45	2					183	197		10.1007/s10933-010-9490-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-010-9490-9													WOS:000286677000005

The research also addresses the synthesis of DNA and cell protein as well as the activity of cellular dehydrogenases depending on time of the day. Results demonstrated that in spring and summer the numbers of bacteria (per cm(3)) in the SM was significantly greater during night-time than day-time (average: May, daytime - 30.058 x 10(6), night-time - 71.343 x 10(6); July, day-time - 10.801 x 10(6), night-time - 40.353 x 10(6)). In October, numbers of bacteria in day- and night-time were not statistically different (respectively: 5.841 x 10(6) and 3.664x 10(6)). Results indicated also that the rate of DNA synthesis by SM bacteria was much higher in the night-time (average: May - 2.049 x 10(-6) pg h(-1) cell(-1); July - 1.363 x 10(-6) pg h(-1) cell(-1)), than in the day-time (average: May - 0.7263 x 10(-6) pg h(-1) cell(-1); July - 0.3404 x 10(-6) pg h(-1) cell(-1)). In contrast, in October the values of DNA synthesis by SM bacteria were higher in night-time. These changes are significantly smaller in SW at a depth of several dozen centimetres. However, no significant impact was observed of a time of the day on the activity of protein synthesis and activity of cellular dehydrogenases by bacteria inhabiting SM and SW.

A survey of water quality indicated that selenium and other contaminants may be of concern at Goshen Warm Springs. We conducted an ecotoxicological study with three objectives: (1) to determine the growth rates of juvenile June suckers in two ponds (Lily Pond and North Pond) at Goshen Warm Springs and in Utah Lake, (2) to determine the uptake and depuration rates of selenium in juvenile June suckers, and (3) to evaluate linmological factors that may influence growth and selenium accumulation in June suckers. Fish growth was significantly greater at Utah Lake and North Pond than at Lily Pond or under current hatchery conditions. At the end of the uptake phase of the study (day 87), selenium concentrations in June suckers from Lily Pond, North Pond, and Utah Lake were 1.62, 1.90, and 1.32 mu g/g of dry weight, respectively. Selenium uptake in June suckers was statistically significant at Lily Pond (0.005 mu g(.)g(-1.)d(-1)), North Pond (0.010 mu g(.)g(-1.)d(-1)), and Utah Lake (0.003 mu g(.)g(-1.)d(-1)). At day 87, the fish were transferred to well water for selenium depuration. Significant selenium depuration occurred after the transfer of June suckers to clean water. Results indicated that selenium bioaccumulated to statistically significant levels at both Lily and North ponds. However, these concentrations are not likely to be of concern because they are not known to cause chronic toxicity. Depuration experiments indicated that June suckers stocked into Utah Lake would eliminate accumulated selenium residues within 3 months. Results indicated that Goshen Warm Springs could be used for fish propagation. In addition, further evaluation of Utah Lake as an interim hatchery site for June suckers should be considered.

Over 1,265 observations of nearly 800 individual neck-banded geese (3.2% of all neck-banded white-fronted geese in North America) were recorded in the region from 1988 through 1996. More than 4,200 observations of these individuals were recorded throughout North America. Observations peaked in November and February, indicating that the Winchester Lakes region is a migratory staging area for white-fronted geese. Only 6% of the birds in this region remained throughout the winter. Most birds staging in the Winchester Lakes region wintered in the rice prairies of coastal Texas and interior Mexico. Eighty-eight percent of the neck-banded geese were from the western portion of the midcontinent population of greater white-fronted geese, primarily representing Interior-Northwest Alaska, Yukon, and Anderson River breeding populations. These breeding populations are characterized by declining trends in population size and survival rates. The status (e.g., population trends, productivity, survival) of these breeding populations must be considered when managing birds in the Winchester Lakes region.																			0038-4909					SEP	2003	48	3					365	372		10.1894/0038-4909(2003)048<0365:BGAAMO>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1894/0038-4909(2003)048<0365:BGAAMO>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000185471600006
J	Vogler, S; Jung, M; Mangini, A				Vogler, S; Jung, M; Mangini, A			Scavenging of Th-234 and Be-7 in Lake Constance	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Particulate and dissolved concentrations of Th-234 and Be-7, along with fluxes of total mass add particulate Th-234 and Be-7 into sediment traps, were measured in Lake Constance (Bodensee) from March to December 1993. During the same period, atmospheric deposition rates of Be-7 and Pb-210 were determined. Variarions in atmospheric fluxes of Be-7 and Pb-210 were found to reflect variability in rainfall. The mean atmospheric flux for Be-7 was 13.5 dpm cm(-2) yr(-1) and for Pb-210 it was 0.65 dpm cm(-2) yr(-1). Total Th-234 activities in surface water were generally high in winter and tow in summer, primarily in response to the seasonality of biological activity. About 50-70% of Th-234 was found in particulate form, depending on particle concentration and particle residence time. Scavenging rates for dissolved Th-234 ranged from 0.14 to 0.88 d(-1), having increased slightly with total particle concentration. Be-7 activities in surface water exhibited large variations because of variable atmospheric input and particle flux. During periods of high biological productivity, particulate Be-7 in surface water increased from similar to 20 to similar to 60% of the total Be-7 concentration. The scavenging rates for dissolved Be-7 (0.01-0.12 d(-1)) were generally lower than those for dissolved Th-234 because of the lower particle reactivity of Be-7. Although the Be-7 flux into sediment traps at 50 m did not differ significantly from the flux at 120 m, the Th-234 flux increased with depth because of the further adsorption of water column-produced Th-234 onto sinking particles. The range of residence times for the total radionuclide inventories estimated from an irreversible scavenging model was 33-83 d for Th-234 and 40-340 d for Be-7 (box depth, 50 m). The residence times of both nuclides were controlled by the particle flux, which, in turn, was determined by biological productivity in the surface water.																			0024-3590					NOV	1996	41	7					1384	1393		10.4319/lo.1996.41.7.1384	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1996.41.7.1384													WOS:A1996WU27300002
J	WRIGHT, D; SHAPIRO, J				WRIGHT, D; SHAPIRO, J			REFUGE AVAILABILITY - A KEY TO UNDERSTANDING THE SUMMER DISAPPEARANCE OF DAPHNIA	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The mid-summer declines of Daphnia species in three small lakes were investigated to examine the relative roles of reduced natality and increased mortality. Reduced natality (assessed by quantifying clutch size, lipid index, and available food) could not account for the decline in daphnid abundance in any of the populations examined. 2. The role of increased mortality imposed by zooplanktivorous fish was assessed by estimating the sizes of the mid-water refuge areas where daphnids could escape fish predation. The boundaries of the refuge areas were estimated from field measurements and literature values and were based on gradients of temperature, dissolved oxygen and light. Observed decreases in refuge thicknesses correlated well with the mid-summer declines of large-bodied Daphnia species in all three lakes. Intermediate-sized daphnids were less affected as the refuges thinned and small-bodied species increased in abundance. 3. The importance of refuge thickness in modifying zooplanktivore-induced mortality was further tested in large enclosures where refuge thickness was experimentally modified. In the presence of zooplanktivorous fish, large-bodied Daphnia, which used the refuge, persisted when the refuge was thick but disappeared when it thinned.

Heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation forms part of a family of advanced water treatment technologies comprising the generation of reactive oxidizing species in water media and results in the complete oxidative degradation (mineralization) of organic pollutants to yield carbon dioxide, water and inorganic ions. A new experimental laboratory-scale 'falling film' reactor has been developed to Study the photocatalytic degradation of microcystins in aqueous solution. The reactor consisted of a fiberglass sheet impregnated with immobilized titanium dioxide (TiO2) catalyst over which the microcystin solution was pumped (as a falling film) while being irradiated from UV-C germicidal lamps. The design of the system obviated the necessity to separate suspended catalyst from treated water as required in slurry reactors. The photocatalytic degradation was characterized by pseudo-first order reaction kinetics. Rapid degradation of microcystins LR, YR and RR was observed in natural lake water with half lives less than 10 min, while even faster rates were achieved in laboratory distilled water. Although low pH (pH 3) marginally improved reaction rates, the presence of radical scavengers such as sulfate ions was detrimental to the photocatalytic oxidation process.

Sampling was performed along downstream sections through different depositional environments (vent, artificial channel and lake, terrace-pools and cascades of proximal slope, marshy environment of distal slope). delta C-13(travertine) values show significant increase (from +6.1 parts per thousand to +11.7 parts per thousand PDB) with increasing distance from the spring orifice, whereas the delta O-18(travertine) values show only slight increase downstream (from -10.7 parts per thousand to -9.1 parts per thousand PDB). Mainly the CO2 outgassing caused the positive downstream shift (similar to 6 parts per thousand) in the delta C-13(travertine) values. The high delta C-13 values of Pamukkale travertines located closest to the spring orifice (not affected by secondary processes) suggest the contribution of CO2 liberated by thermometamorphic decarbonation besides magmatic sources. Based on the gradual downstream increase of the concentration of the conservative Na+, K+, Cl-, evaporation was estimated to be 2-5%, which coincides with the moderate effect of evaporation on the water isotope composition. Stable isotopic compositions of the Pamukkale thermal water springs show of meteoric origin, and indicate a Local Meteoric Water Line of Denizli Basin to be between the Global Meteoric Water Line (Craig, 1961) and Western Anatolian Meteoric Water Line (Simsek, 2003). Detailed evaluation of several major and trace element contents measured in the water and in the precipitated travertine along the Pamukkale MM section revealed which elements are precipitated in the carbonate or concentrated in the detrital minerals. Former studies on the Hungarian Egerszalok travertine (Kele et al., 2008a, b, 2009) had shown that the isotopic equilibrium is rarely maintained under natural conditions during calcite precipitation in the temperature range between 41 and 67 degrees C. In this paper, besides the detailed geochemical analyses along downstream sections, we present new evidences of non-equilibrium calcite-water fractionation in lower temperature range (13.3 to 51.3 degrees C). Our measurements and calculations on natural hot water travertine precipitations at Pamukkale and Egerszalok revealed that the delta O-18(travertine) is equal with the delta O-18(HCO3) at the orifice of the thermal springs, which means that practically there is no oxygen isotope fractionation between these two phases. High rate of CO2 degassing with rapid precipitation of carbonate could be responsible for this as it was theoretically supposed by O'Neil et al. (1969). Thus, for the determination of the deposition temperature of a fossil travertine deposit we propose to use the water-bicarbonate oxygen isotope equilibrium fractionation instead of the water-travertine fractionation, which can result 8-9 degrees C difference in the calculated values. Our study is the first detailed empirical proof of O'Neil's hypothesis on a natural carbonate depositing system. The presented observations can be used to identify more precisely the deposition temperature of fossil travertines during paleoclimate studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Monthly precipitation isoscapes (δ18O) of the United States: Connections with surface temperatures, moisture source conditions, and air mass trajectories	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												This research presents the most spatially complete data set depicting average monthly delta O-18 precipitation values across the United States (isoscapes). Average monthly isoscapes were calculated by analyzing 5 consecutive years of precipitation samples collected at 73 collection sites from the United States Network for Isotopes in Precipitation. Three patterns across the United States emerged from the analysis: (1) the most O-18-depleted precipitation was not confined to the higher elevations of the Rocky Mountain region but were also found in the upper Great Lakes; (2) clear latitudinal gradients were observed in the Mississippi River valley: steeper during cold months than during warm months; and (3) coastal latitudinal gradients were significantly shallower than continental gradients. The average monthly isoscapes were significantly correlated with surface temperatures, particularly in winter but less so in summer. The Rayleigh distillation model, however, produced uniformly steeper monthly isotope temperature coefficients (delta O-18 parts per thousand/degrees C) than those calculated from empirical delta O-18 values. Our analysis suggests that differences in model/observation isotope temperature coefficients result from the contiguous United States having two primary moisture sources: the Gulf of Mexico and the northeast Pacific Ocean regions. A significant proportion of precipitation sourced from the Gulf of Mexico (northeast Pacific Ocean) occurs in warm (cool) regions resulting in more (less) isotopic depletion than if all moisture had originated from one source for the entire United States. These two primary precipitation source scenarios result in a smaller variation in oxygen isotopic variation for the distribution of temperatures in a given month, yielding lower than predicted isotope temperature coefficients. The results of this study highlight the importance of understanding environmental factors affecting regional precipitation isotope values, particularly if one wishes to use isotopic analysis for paleoclimate interpretation or as a measure of a modern day hydrologic process.					; White, James/A-7845-2009; Welker, Jeffrey/C-9493-2013; Vaughn, Bruce/AAO-8867-2020	VAUGHN, BRUCE/0000-0001-6503-957X; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				NOV 12	2010	115								D21126	10.1029/2010JD014105	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2010JD014105													WOS:000284220400006

In 1976 the municipal sewage loading was diverted from the lake. Initially, the recovery of the lake was rapid but after some years it slowed down and summer blooms of cyanobacteria (Aphanizomenon, Microcystis) increased again. Field experiments in four enclosures with different roach densities, and the nearby lake area (2-3 m depth zone) were carried out to evaluate the contribution of fish, zooplankton, water turbulence, phosphorus and nitrogen to the development of summer algal biomass and species dominance. In general, phytoplankton biomass increased during the field experiment (21 June-1 August) with the fish density. The artificially induced turbulence, as well as phosphorus enrichment alone, had little effect on algal biomass and species composition, but combined with nitrogen enrichment considerably increased the algal biomass and the numbers of cyanobacteria in three of the four enclosures. However, at the end of the experiment there was wide variation in the species composition and dominance between different enclosures. Grazing by zooplankton was of minor importance in all enclosures and also in the lake.																			0018-8158					OCT 2	1992	243						303	310		10.1007/BF00007046	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007046													WOS:A1992JZ96300032
J	Wærvågen, SB; Nilssen, JP				Waervagen, Svein Birger; Nilssen, Jens Petter			Life histories and seasonal dynamics of common boreal pelagic copepods (Crustacea, Copepoda) inhabiting an oligotrophic Fennoscandian lake	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The annual seasonal abundance and spatial distribution of four widespread pelagic copepods, the Palaeartic calanoid Eudiaptomus gracilis, the cyclopoids Mesocyclops leuckarti and Thermocyclops oithonoides, and the Holartic Cyclops scutifer were investigated in Lake Gjerstadvann, an oligotrophic boreal lake. Important ecological traits such as life cycles, pelagic microhabitats and wintering strategies varied strongly between the investigated copepods, and influenced seasonal succession in the plankton community. Fish predation did not seem to affect copepod abundances, except perhaps the two lage-sized, less abundant species, the Palaeartic calanoid Heterocope saliens and the Holartic cyclopoid Cyclops abyssorum. Life cycles varied from one (C. scutifer) to three (M. leuckarti and E. gracilis) complete generations per year, primarily related to habitat temperatures. Wintering took place as late instars (C. scutifer, C. abyssorum) or cop V and adults (E. gracilis) in the plankton, late instars in profundal (F. oithonoides) or littoral (M. leuckarti) sediment diapause, and embryonic diapause in sediment egg bank (H. saliens). C. scutifer and C. abyssorum exhibited delayed development in the profundal waters during winter, which could be characterised as so-called "active diapause". C. scutifer, T. oithonoides, and C. abyssomm in Lake Gjerstadvann were probably negatively affected by acidified waters. M. leuckarti seemed to be the most acid-tolerant of these species being able to endure pH slightly below 5.0, whereas T. oithonoides was usually absent at such pH levels. The calanoid species H. saliens and E. gracilis were extremely tolerant towards acidic environments. The yearly differences in population abundance as indicated by the fluctuations in the diapausing populations were probably due to environmental variations in water chemistry occurring during the most vulnerable ontogenetic stages, i.e., eggs and nauplii. Even if the pelagic ecosystem in boreal and oligotrophic lakes may appear homogeneous, a whole array of life histories and dormancy patterns has evolved among copepods.																			1129-5767	1723-8633					2010	69	2					311	332		10.4081/jlimnol.2010.311	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2010.311													WOS:000282859700013
J	Kucherenko, VM				Kucherenko, Volodymyr M.			The diversity-area relationship for waterbird communities in small artificial reservoirs over winter	JOURNAL OF VERTEBRATE BIOLOGY												In the middle of the 20th century, artificial reservoirs were created in Crimea due to a lack of freshwater resources. The nearest important hotspot for waterbirds is more than 100 km from these reservoirs. The five reservoirs are differently sized, and their water levels vary in response to regional climatic conditions and ice formation during winter. In this study, we investigate the bird communities of these small reservoirs using long-term waterbird surveys. Data were collected over 18 observation sessions on the five reservoirs in the winters of 2009-2021, with observations from the Simferopolske reservoirs grouped into two clusters for 2009-2014 and 2015-2021. Waterbird species richness was moderate, ranging between three and 19 species, including two considered threatened. Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), Caspian gull (Larus cachinnans) and common gull (Larus canus) contributed significantly to dissimilarities between observations, with numbers of common gull decreasing significantly in relation to average January temperature and precipitation. Fisher's alpha diversity and Caspian gull number showed negative relationships with water surface area. We suggest that such negative relationships between area and diversity can be observed during cold waves when species are forced to migrate in search of more favourable conditions, leading to increased diversity in small areas.

J	HOLADAY, AS; BOWES, G				HOLADAY, AS; BOWES, G			C-4 ACID METABOLISM AND DARK CO2 FIXATION IN A SUBMERSED AQUATIC MACROPHYTE (HYDRILLA-VERTICILLATA)	PLANT PHYSIOLOGY												The CO2 compensation point of the submersed aquatic macrophyte H. verticillata varied from high (above 50 .mu.l/l) to low (10-25 .mu.l/l) values, depending on the growth conditions. Plants from the lake in winter or after incubation in an 11.degree. C/9 h photoperiod had high values, whereas summer plants or those incubated in a 27.degree. C/14 h photoperiod and low values. The plants with low CO2 compensation points exhibited dark 14CO2 fixation rates that were up to 30% of the light fixation rates. This fixation reduced respiratory CO2 loss, but did not result in a net uptake of CO2 at night. The low compensation point plants also showed diurnal fluctuations in titratable acid, such as occur in Crassulacean acid metabolism plants. Dark fixation and diurnal acid fluctuations were negligible in Hydrilla plants with high CO2 compensation points. Exposure of the low compensation point plants to 20 .mu.M 14CO2 resulted in 60% of the 14C being incorporated into malate and aspartate, with only 16% in sugar phosphates. At a high CO2 level, the C4 acid label was decreased. A pulse-chase study indicated that the 14C in malate, but for asparate, decreased after a long (270 s) chase period; thus, the C4 acid turnover was much slower than in C4 plants. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activity was high (330 .mu.mol/mg chlorophyll per h), as compared to ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (20-25), in the plants with low compensation points. These plants also had a pyruvate, Pi dikinase activity in the leaves of 41 .mu.mol/mg chlorophyll per h, which suggests they are not C3 plants. NAD- and NADP+-malate dehydrogenase activities were 6136 and 24.5 .mu.mol/mg chlorophyll per h, respectively. Of the 3 decarboxylating enzymes assayed, the activities of NAD- and NADP-malic enzyme were 104.2 and 23.7 .mu.mol/mg chlorophyll per h, while phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was only 0.2. Low compensation point Hydrilla plants fix some CO2 into C4 acids, which can be decarboxylated for later refixation, presumably into the Calvin cycle. Refixation would be advantageous in summer lake environments where the CO2 levels are high at night but low during the day. Hydrilla does not fit any of the present photosynthetic categories, and may have to be placed into a new group, together with other submersed aquatic macrophytes that have environmentally variable CO2 compensation points.																			0032-0889	1532-2548					1980	65	2					331	335		10.1104/pp.65.2.331	http://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.65.2.331								16661184					WOS:A1980JG42600031

Robustness of adult female survival maintains a high-density sika deer (Cervus nippon) population following the initial irruption	WILDLIFE RESEARCH												Context. Irruption of large herbivore populations is characterised by three distinct phases: (1) an exponential increase in population to a peak abundance; (2) a population crash; and (3) a second increase to another population peak, typically lower than the first peak of abundance. However, there has been little study of age-and sex-specific factors that affect the post-initial irruption interactions with food sources. Aims. We aimed to investigate annual survival rates of sika deer (Cervus nippon Temminck, 1838) in the sequent irruption of a population on Nakanoshima Island, Lake Toya, Japan, with a chronically high density during the period 2002-12. Methods. Survival monitoring data were obtained for 219 individuals (93 males and 126 females) using radio-collars. Annual survival was quantified, and related factors, i.e. deer abundance and winter severity, were determined by model selection using Akaike information criterion values. Key Results. The results showed that annual survival rates across sexes and age classes (fawn, yearling, prime-aged, old) decreased with increasing population density, snow depth and winter precipitation. Winter severity had a greater effect on adult survival than density regulation. Nevertheless, female adult survival was maintained at a high level, with a mean of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.80-0.88). Key conclusions. Robust survival rates for adult females might contribute to the maintenance of a high-density sika deer population in the post-initial irruption.					; Iijima, Hayato/L-5070-2018; Takeshita, Kazutaka/HPE-1411-2023	Takeshita, Kazutaka/0000-0002-6866-6074; Ikeda, Takashi/0000-0003-3217-3275; Iijima, Hayato/0000-0003-1064-9420; 													1035-3712	1448-5494					2018	45	2					143	154		10.1071/WR17103	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WR17103													WOS:000431735700004

The bloom can be divided into four distinct growth periods (March 1-April 28) and a period of collapse (April 29-May 16). During the four growth periods, growth pulses were found to be associated with high solar radiation, little wind and a shallow mixed layer, whereas stagnation or loss was associated with strong winds and a consequent deepening of the mixed layer, resulting in an unfavourable effective light climate. The population collapse was brought about by zooplankton grazing, possibly coupled with nutrient limitation and other factors.																			1015-1621	1420-9055					1989	51	1					47	58		10.1007/BF00877780	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00877780													WOS:A1989U348400004
J	KRONVANG, B				KRONVANG, B			THE EXPORT OF PARTICULATE MATTER, PARTICULATE PHOSPHORUS AND DISSOLVED PHOSPHORUS FROM 2 AGRICULTURAL RIVER BASINS - IMPLICATIONS ON ESTIMATING THE NONPOINT PHOSPHORUS LOAD	WATER RESEARCH												The transport of particulate matter (PM), particulate phosphorus (PP) and dissolved phosphorus (DP) in two agricultural river basins was intensively measured during 1 year (October 1986-September 1987). Seasonal and stage-dependent rating relationships between the concentration of particulate inorganic (PIM) and organic matter (POM) and discharge were calculated for the Lyngbygaards river whereas only single rating relationships were established for the Aarhus river, in which a high proportion of the catchment area drains to lakes (48%). The export coefficients for PIM were rather similar for the two catchments (228 and 271 kg ha-1 yr-1) when only including the part of the river basins actively involved in sediment delivery and in the range previously reported for lowland rivers in Canada and U.K. Significant relationships between PIM and POM and the associated phosphorus fractions were calculated. During low-flow periods the P-content of PIM were high (1.5 and 1.2%) decreasing to 0.5% during high flow. On the contrary, the P-content of POM was constantly around 1% except for a period in late summer in the Lyngbygaards river where the P-content decreased to 0.2-0.3% during the first autumn storms following weed cutting. A very high P-enrichment in PM compared with average soil P-content was documented (7-14) indicating the selective delivery and routing of PM in lowland rivers. In both rivers the concentration of dissolved inorganic P (DIP) were inversely related to discharge demonstrating the dilution of P from point sources at increasing flow. However, in the Lyngbygaards river significantly higher concentration levels of DIP were recognized at periods of storm run-off possibly indicating the importance of DIP delivery with surface run-off and P-releases during resuspension of PM from the river bottom. The non-point P-load was nearly equally high (1.15 and 0.90 kg ha-1 yr-1) in the two agricultural basins when omitting the part of the Aarhus river basin draining to the deep Stilling/Solbjerg lake which retains appreciable amounts of P. Equally high non-point P-loads are reported for agricultural basins in Finland and Norway whereas appreciable lower non-point P-loads are normally reported for agricultural areas in Sweden and Denmark.					kronvang, brian/I-7715-2013														0043-1354	1879-2448				OCT	1992	26	10					1347	1358		10.1016/0043-1354(92)90129-R	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(92)90129-R													WOS:A1992JM77300008

Quaternary tephrochronology and deposition in the subsurface Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California, USA	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												We document characteristics of tephra, including fades and geochemistry, from 27 subsurface sites in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California, to obtain stratigraphic constraints in a complex setting. Analyzed tephra deposits correlate with: 1) an unnamed tephra from the Carlotta Formation near Ferndale, California, herein informally named the ash of Wildcat Grade (<similar to 1.450 to >similar to 0.780 Ma), 2) the Rockland ash bed (similar to 0.575 Ma), 3) the Loleta ash bed (similar to 0.390 Ma), and 4) middle Pleistocene volcanic ash deposits at Tulelake, California, and Pringle Falls, Bend, and Summer Lake, Oregon, herein informally named the dacitic ash of Hood (<similar to 0.211 to >similar to 0.180 Ma). All four tephra are derived from Cascades volcanic sources. The Rockland ash bed erupted from the southern Cascades and occurs in up to >7-m-thick deposits in cores from similar to 40 m subsurface in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Tephra facies and tephra age constraints suggest rapid tephra deposition within fluvial channel and overbank settings, likely related to flood events shortly following volcanic eruption. Such rapidly deposited tephra are important chronostratigraphic markers that suggest varying sediment accumulation rates in Quaternary deposits below the modern Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. This study provides the first steps in a subsurface Quaternary stratigraphic framework necessary for future hazard assessment.

Falling atmospheric pressure as a trigger for methane ebullition from peatland	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												[1] Peatlands are widely regarded as a significant source of atmospheric CH4, a potent greenhouse gas. At present, most of the information on environmental emissions of CH4 comes from infrequent, temporally discontinuous ground-based flux measurements. Enormous efforts have been made to extrapolate measured emission rates to establish seasonal or annual averages using relevant biogeochemical factors, such as water table positions or peat temperatures, by assuming that the flux was stationary during a substantial nonsampling period. However, this assumption has not been explicitly verified, and little is known about the continuous variation of the CH4 flux in a timescale of individual flux measurement. In this study, we show an abrupt change in the CH4 emission rate associated with falling atmospheric pressure. We found that the CH4 flux can change by 2 orders of magnitude within a matter of tens of minutes owing to the release of free-phase CH4 triggered by a drop in air pressure. The contribution of the ebullition to the total CH4 flux during the measurements was significant (50 - 64%). These results clearly indicated that field campaigns must be designed to cover this rapid temporal variability caused by ebullition, which may be especially important in intemperate weather. Process- based CH4 emission models should also be modified to include air pressure as a key factor for the control of ebullient CH4 release from peatland.

However, the extent to which these temperature gradients impacted rainfall patterns across East Asia, and particularly the northern extent of the monsoon domain, remains controversial. Here we present the first hydrological record extending back eight million years (Ma) for North China Plain derived from organic biomarkers preserved in a terrestrial sediment sequence. Our record shows a significant increase in monsoon rainfall during the Early Pliocene (similar to 4.2-4.5 Ma), coincident with strengthening of Pacific meridional and zonal SST gradients, and the eastern equatorial Pacific cold tongue. This marked intensification of the monsoon rainfall in northern China is also observed in paleoclimate archives from southern Asia, but anti-phased with those from central-eastern China (including southern China), indicating a 'tripole-like' rainfall pattern over East Asia. Through a set of climate model experiments, we show that this redistribution of monsoon rainfall across East Asia during the Early Pliocene (5.33-3.6 Ma) was likely due to an equatorward contraction of the western Pacific warm pool, reduced summer convection in the western subtropical Pacific, and the strengthening of the Hadley and Walker circulations. Our study thus highlights the strong influence of Pacific Ocean temperature gradients on East Asian hydroclimate. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The TM remote sensing images of 1986-2015 years were selected in this paper, and the land use change model and gray relational analysis model were used to analyze the effect of land use degree on the habitat of the winter crane and correlation degree between cranes and land use of Shengjin lake wetland. The land use transformation method was employed to analyze the transfer of the habitat of cranes and the relationship between the size of the cranes habitat and the number of populations. The results showed that the degree of land use change fluctuated greatly in different periods, and comprehensive index of land use degree between 220 and 260, also the land use was based on woodland, grassland, and water and their effect on the habitat was limited; the marsh land had the highest retention rate among the cranes habitat being 34.44%. While the reed flat had the lowest rate, only 15.36%, and the reed breach land was mainly transferred to marsh and dry land, 23.22% and 18.16%, respectively. The mud was mainly transferred to water and farmland, respectively, for 31.79% and 27.75%; except the period from 2011 to 2015, the change of habitat area was basically consistent with the change of the number of cranes.					yang, fei/HPF-9658-2023; lu, yuting/IIS-2826-2023; Wang, Cheng/AAM-1711-2021; Fang, Lei/Q-4913-2019	Wang, Cheng/0000-0002-1273-6184; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				MAR	2020	27	7					7515	7525		10.1007/s11356-019-07096-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-07096-5								31885059					WOS:000519410100066

(Potamogetonales:Zosteraceae), and an Effective Technique for Transplantation of Long Shoots in a Temperate Tidal Zone (Northern China)	WETLANDS												In China, the coastal eelgrass Zostera marina has decreased dramatically since the 1980s as a result of human-induced habitat deterioration. From March 2009 to June 2010, we investigated the temporal changes in biometric and biomass features of Z. marina from a declined meadow owing to fisheries mechanical destruction in tidal Qingdao Bay, and we conducted an in situ transplantation experiment to develop an effective technique for transplantation of long shoots. Results showed that shoot height and biomass exhibited strong temporal variation, with a maximum shoot height (128.50 +/- 17.63 cm) being recorded in June 2009 and minimum value (29.18 +/- 3.89 cm) in January 2010. Shoot density in winter (311 +/- 51 shoots m(-2)) was significantly lower than that in summer (545 +/- 113 shoots m(-2)). N and P contents in the rhizome were significantly lower than those in the leaf and leaf sheath. Low C/P ratios (248.82 +/- 81.7, 199.8 +/- 87.5 and 289.2 +/- 95.1 in leaves, leaf sheaths and rhizomes, respectively) suggested P enrichment of the eelgrass. The field recovery experiment showed that the eelgrass shoots had a high resilience even when most leaves were sheared. Long shoots were not suitable to be directly used for transplantation; however, when they were cut shorter (e.g. 18 cm) with most leaves removed, the transplant survivorship reached a high level (ca. 90%). It is suggested that transplantation may be practiced when seagrass meadows (donor beds) reached high density and biomass, and in this case long shoots should be trimmed short before transplanting as a way to improve early transplant success.

Contribution of zooplankton nutrient recycling and effects on phytoplankton size structure in a hypereutrophic reservoir	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Consumer nutrient recycling influences aquatic ecosystem functioning by altering the movement and transformation of nutrients. In hypereutrophic reservoirs, zooplankton nutrient recycling has been considered negligible due to high concentrations of available nutrients. A comparative analysis ( ) found that zooplankton communities in hypereutrophic lakes are dominated by nitrogen (N)-rich species, which the authors hypothesized would increase phosphorus (P) availability through excretion. However, zooplankton nutrient recycling likely varies over the course of a growing season due to changes in biomass, community composition and grazing pressure on phytoplankton. We quantified zooplankton, phytoplankton and nutrient concentration dynamics during the summer of 2019 in a temperate, hypereutrophic reservoir. We found that the estimated contribution of zooplankton excretion to the dissolved nutrient pool on a given day was equivalent to a substantial proportion (21-39%) of the dissolved inorganic P standing stock in early summer when P concentrations were low and limiting phytoplankton growth. Further, we found evidence that zooplankton affected phytoplankton size distributions through selective grazing of smaller phytoplankton cells likely affecting nutrient uptake and storage by phytoplankton. Overall, our results demonstrate zooplankton excretion in hypereutrophic reservoirs likely helped drive springtime phytoplankton dynamics through nutrient recycling while grazing influenced phytoplankton size distributions.					; Wilkinson, Grace/AAD-3202-2020	Butts, Tyler/0000-0002-3562-365X; 													0142-7873	1464-3774				NOV 23	2022	44	6					851	865		10.1093/plankt/fbac045	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbac045		SEP 2022											WOS:000852754500001

Values of Schmidt stability and Lake Number indicated stable summer stratification. Depending on their depth and wind shelter, the lakes could be characterized by various stratification patterns. A near-linear stratification was observed in the Malom Tisza oxbow where in summer during midday the whole water column belonged to the metalimnion. Mixing of the upper water layer was generated by nocturnal cooling. Stable stratification had pronounced consequences for the vertical distribution of chemical variables and phytoplankton. Concentration of sestonic chlorophyll showed bimodal distribution produced by algae in the upper and purple bacteria in the deeper layers. These results revealed that processes and phenomena associated with deep stratified lakes can be observed in shallow basins.

J	Bowman, D; Shachnovich-Firtel, Y; Devora, S				Bowman, Dan; Shachnovich-Firtel, Yonit; Devora, Shlomo			Stream channel convexity induced by continuous base level lowering, the Dead Sea, Israel	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The Dead Sea level has dropped from -388.4 in in 1896 to -417.2 m in 2004 and continues to fall rapidly, reaching a record of 1 m/y drop. Such a dramatic base level fall, on time scales of several tens of years, makes the Dead Sea area a unique field laboratory. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of the lowering Dead Sea, as a base level, on the longitudinal profiles of channels, on the formation of knick points, and on the sinuosity. Field studies were made along the lower courses of creeks which drain lakeward. Precise longitudinal profile measurements and their fitting to linear and logarithmic curves, show they are planar to slightly convex. The short convexity, the absence of hydrological or lithological control, and former experimental results of profile response to base level fall, suggest that the convexity results from the recent continuous rapid drop of the Dead Sea. The convexity is also an inheritance of the paleo morphology, i.e., the original convex front of the fan deltas and coastal scarps following channel incision, slope displacement and diffusion. The erodible substrate and the high stream power prevented preservation of nickpoints along the main channels. Sinuosity of the meandering thalwegs remained low 1.1-1.2, indicating no response to the base level lowering along the steep slopes. Although the stream channels are incised in soft sediments, the base level-induced entrenchment dies out within 1000 in or less from the receding shoreline. The channel profiles demonstrate different phases of adjustment to the lowering base level. The uniqueness of the Dead Sea case is that, contrary to former field and experimental studies, the system is in a continuous relaxation period without reaching a final adjustment. The channels are "trapped" in their convex form following a rapid on going base level fall upon exposed paleo fan deltas. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here we present a speleothem record of Asian summer monsoon (ASM) during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11 interglacial (MIS 11c), from Yongxing cave, China. The record's unprecedented chronologic constraints and decadal-scale temporal resolution allow a precise and direct comparison of ASM between the MIS 11c and the Holocene. Our data suggest that orbital-centennial patterns of ASM were remarkably similar during both interglacial, including their pacing and structure. Notably, a multi-millennial stronger monsoon late in MIS 11c, the "Late-MIS 11c shift," is similar to the Late Holocene strengthening of the ASM, the "2-Kyr shift." Thus, the multicentennial ASM weakening at the end of the Late-MIS 11c shift could imply that the current century-long ASM waning trend may persist into the future, if only natural forcings are considered. Plain Language Summary The interglacial of Marine Isotope Stage 11 (MIS 11c) is generally considered to be an appropriate natural climate analog to the current interglacial, the Holocene. A new speleothem oxygen-isotope (delta O-18) record is reconstructed to characterize Asian summer monsoon (ASM) variability across MIS 11c on a wide range of timescales. This new record has an unprecedented high resolution (similar to 11 years) and precise chronology constrained by(230) Th dating and annual band counting. It thus allows for the first time a precise comparison of ASM variability between MIS 11c and the Holocene. We find that the observed pattern of decreasing ASM strength during the late portion of MIS 11c was interrupted by a multi-millennial period of stronger monsoon (the "Late-MIS 11c shift"), which is similar to the Late Holocene increase in ASM strength (the "2-Kyr shift"), which also occurred against a backdrop of long-term decline in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation. Notably, the Late-MIS 11c shift was terminated by a multicentennial ASM weakening trend, thus suggesting that the current century-long ASM waning trend could persist into the future, provided that the anthropogenic forcing does not supersede the natural variability.					; CHENG, HAI/H-3413-2017; Cheng, Hai/H-3413-2017; ZHANG, HAIWEI/HGA-0301-2022; Edwards, Richard/JAX-3732-2023	Baker, Jonathan/0000-0002-7070-7365; Zhang, Haiwei/0000-0002-0855-1283; Zhao, Xinnan/0000-0002-0185-5153; Cheng, Hai/0000-0002-5305-9458; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				AUG 28	2019	46	16					9949	9957		10.1029/2019GL083836	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019GL083836													WOS:000490966700070
J	Li, J; Tian, LH; Xiao, X; Zhang, CC				Li, Jing; Tian, Lihui; Xiao, Xiong; Zhang, Cicheng			Controls on daily to interannual variations of summer precipitation isotopic signatures from Qinghai Lake watershed, northeastern Tibetan Plateau	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Numerous crucial paleoclimate records in monsoon regions depend on past precipitation isotopes as proxies for hydroclimate; however, the relationship between climatic variability and precipitation isotopes remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated key climatic drivers from local to regional scales using 7-year-long daily summer precipitation isotopes in the Qinghai Lake watershed of the northeast Tibetan Plateau, located in the margin of summer monsoon extent. Results showed that daily precipitation delta O-18 and delta H-2 exhibited intra-seasonal fluctuation from 2012 to 2018 characterized by low isotopic values in July (e.g., delta O-18 = - 10 parts per thousand) and high values in June (e.g., delta O-18 = - 6.7 parts per thousand). Moisture source analysis via Hybrid Sing-Particle Lagrangian Trajectory indicated that the primary moisture of Qinghai Lake was mainly derived from northwestern inland regions, North China, and South China across seasons with high specific humidity and trajectory frequency, having a great influence on the isotopic patterns in precipitation across seasons. Moreover, convective activities in the primary moisture source regions, shown by outgoing longwave radiation and specific humidity along back trajectory, played a crucial role in controlling the seasonal variability of precipitation isotopes. These effects could be closely associated with the upstream convective intensity over the moisture sources or the changes of moisture sources during the observation periods. Interannual precipitation delta O-18 variation was significantly correlated with the indices of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (r = 0.63, p < 0.1), with high precipitation delta O-18 value in the dry El Nino year of 2015. Our findings suggested that precipitation isotopes in the Qinghai Lake watershed represented a spatial-temporal integrative indicator of precipitating processes and convection activity, providing the interpretation of paleo-isotope data in the regional hydroclimate variability across monsoon-affected regions.

Secondary Production of Highly Unsaturated Fatty Acids by Zoobenthos Across Rivers Contrasting in Temperature	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA), namely eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3, EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3, DHA), which are essential for many animals, including humans, are mainly produced in aquatic trophic webs. In fast-flowing rivers, macrozoobenthos is the main source of HUFA for fish and may be particularly vulnerable to thermal alterations associated with climate change. We studied benthic communities in a unique natural ecosystem: the Yenisei River downstream of the dam of Krasnoyarsk Hydroelectric Power Station with very low temperature in summer because of discharge of cold water from deep in the reservoir and its tributaries with high summer temperature. This natural experiment' allowed to get rid of confounding factors, such as differences in light, seasonality, geology (biogeochemistry) and biogeography (regional species pools). As found, in spite of an increase of biodiversity and rates of daily production in warm rivers compared with cold sites, DHA and partly EPA production of zoobenthos decreased with the increase of temperature because of changes in species composition. Thus, in a climate warming context, we can predict a decrease of production of these HUFA by river zoobenthos and thereby a diminishing of their supply for fish and next to humans.

Environmental factors influencing annual sucker (Catostomus sp.) migration into a Great Lakes tributary	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Fish migration in rivers is a growing area of concern as mounting anthropogenic influences, particularly fragmentation from dams and barriers, constitute major threats to global river species diversity. Barriers can impede the movement of fishes between areas critical to the completion of their lifecycle, affecting both population and ecosystem viability. In response, fish passage solutions have been identified as a critical need to maintain fisheries viability in the Laurentian Great Lakes, and around the world. Pivotal to the success of these fish passage solutions is a more complete understanding of the movement phenology and environmental cues that instigate migration. We used a dual-frequency identification sonar (DIDSON) to evaluate environmental triggers of river entry during spring and summer for three size classes of migratory fishes in the Boardman River, a Lake Michigan tributary. Our results indicate that medium size fish (>30 cm and < 50 cm), primarily composed of white sucker Catostomus commersonii and longnose sucker Catostomus catostomus were 21% more likely to enter the river at sunset and 25% less likely at midnight in comparison to midday. Entry rates of medium fish increased 6% for every 1 degrees C increase in river temperature, 4% for every 1 m(3)/s increase in river discharge from the day prior, and were reduced by 1% for every 10 cm increase in lake level. Understanding these processes in the tributaries of the Great Lakes is important to inform the fish passage solutions currently being developed for the Boardman River, and to inform management regulations for Great Lakes migratory fishes.

This comprehensive reference dataset combined with the modern analogue technique (MAT) provides a powerful tool for pollen-based reconstruction of the Quaternary Northwest Pacific climate. Pollen-derived reconstruction of the modern climate at the reference pollen-sampling sites matches well with the estimated modern climate values (R-2 values vary between 0.79 and 0.95, and RMSEP values vary between 5.8 and 9.7% of the modern climatic range for all nine tested variables). The successful testing of the method encourages its application to the fossil pollen records. We used a coarse-resolution pollen record from Lake Biwa to reconstruct glacial-interglacial climate dynamics in central Japan since similar to 438 kyr and compared it to the earlier reconstruction based on a less representative reference dataset. The current and earlier results consistently demonstrate that the coldest glacial intervals experienced pronounced cooling in winter and moderate cooling in summer, supporting the growth of cool mixed forest (COMX) where warm mixed forest (WAMX) predominates today. During the last glacial, maximum (similar to 24 kyr BP) mean temperatures of the coldest (MTCO) and warmest (MTWA) month were about -13 degrees C (RMSEP = 2.34 degrees C) and 21 degrees C (RMSEP = 1.66 degrees C) respectively, and annual precipitation (PANN) was about 800 mm (RMSEP = 158.06 mm). During the thermal optimums of the interglacial intervals, the temperatures of the coldest and warmest month were above 0 degrees C and 25 degrees C respectively, leading to the reconstruction of WAMX and temperate conifer forest (TECO). Although both these vegetation types grow in the southern part of Japan today, WAMX requires warmer space. The presence of WAMX during marine isotope stages (MIS) 11 and 1, and its absence during MIS 9 and MIS 5 contradict the marine isotope and Antarctic ice records, suggesting that the latter two interglacials were the warmest of the last 800 kyr. The apparent contradiction allows at least three different explanations including low temporal resolution of the pollen record; different trends in CO2 concentrations during 'short' and 'long' interglacials; and regional climate variability and non-linear response of different regions to the global forcing. More definitive conclusions will be possible on the basis of forthcoming high-resolution pollen records from central Japan. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Accurately forecasting those exceedances has been difficult as a result of the complex meteorological and photochemical processes fostering them. To help improve such forecasts, a low-cost field study was conducted during summer 2015 to provide comprehensive observations of boundary-layer ozone concentrations in the context of the prevailing meteorological conditions. A network of surface ozone sensors was supplemented by sensors mounted on vehicles, a public transit light-rail car, news helicopter, tethered sonde, and unmanned aerial vehicle. The temporal and spatial evolution of boundary-layer ozone concentrations were compared with the prevailing regional and local meteorological conditions on the basis of gridded operational analyses, surface weather stations, and additional sensors deployed for the field study. High ozone concentrations during June 2015 resulted primarily from local processes while smoke transported from distant wildfires contributed to elevated ozone concentrations during August. The Great Salt Lake influenced ozone concentrations along the Wasatch Front through several mechanisms, most importantly its impact on local wind circulations. The highest ozone concentrations were often found in a narrow zone between the Great Salt Lake and the urban regions to its south and east. Observations from multiple fixed site and mobile platforms during 18-19 August illustrate the complex variations in ozone concentrations as a function of elevation at the surface as well as vertically through the deep boundary layer.					; Blaylock, Brian/HPD-4455-2023	Horel, John/0000-0002-2328-5008; Blaylock, Brian/0000-0003-2133-9313; Jacques, Alexander/0009-0004-3729-2702; 													1530-261X					SEP	2016	17	9					480	486		10.1002/asl.680	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asl.680													WOS:000383602200001

However, freshwater ecosystems in glacierized regions differ critically from those in non-glacierized regions. The potential emissions of CO2 and CH4 from glacierized environments in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) were only recently recognized. Here, the first direct measurement of CO2 and CH4 emission fluxes and isotopic composition during the spring of 2022 in 13 glacial lakes of the TP revealed that glacial lakes were the previously overlooked CO2 sinks due to chemical weathering in glacierized regions. The daily average CO2 flux was -5.1 & PLUSMN; 4.4 mmol m(-2) d(-1), and the CO2 consumption could reach 38.9 Gg C-CO2 yr(-1) by all glacial lakes in the TP. This consumption might be larger during summer when glaciers experience intensive melting, highlighting the importance of CO2 uptake by glacial lakes on the global carbon cycle. However, the studied glacial lakes were CH4 sources with total emission flux ranging from 4.4 & PLUSMN; 3.3 to 4082.5 & PLUSMN; 795.6 & mu;mol m(-2) d(-1). The large CH4 range was attributed to ebullition found in three of the glacial lakes. Low dissolved organic carbon concentrations and CH4 oxidation might be responsible for the low CH4 diffusive fluxes of glacial lakes without ebullition. In addition, groundwater input could alter CO2 and CH4 emissions from glacial lakes. CH4 in glacial lakes probably had a thermogenic source; whereas CO2 was influenced mainly by atmospheric input, as well as organic matter remineralization and CH4 oxidation. Overall, glacial lakes in the TP play an important role in the global carbon cycle and budget, and more detailed isotopic and microbial studies are needed to constrain the contributions of different pathways to CO2 and CH4 production, consumption and emissions.					; Yu, Zhengliang Yu/ISA-1022-2023; Kang, Shichang/I-6830-2018; wang, lei/JQV-5907-2023	Tripathee, Lekhendra/0000-0001-6210-5105; li, chao liu/0000-0003-2092-2435; 													1748-9326					SEP 1	2023	18	9							094025	10.1088/1748-9326/aceb7b	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aceb7b													WOS:001050259400001

Thermohaline stratification and double diffusion diapycnal fluxes in the hypersaline Dead Sea	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The Dead Sea is a hypersaline terminal lake, experiencing negative water balance, increasing salinity, and NaCl (halite) crystallization. We observed atypical evolution of the thermohaline stratification in comparison to most lakes due to the role of salt crystallization and diapycnal fluxes across lake layers. We characterized the dynamics of the thermohaline properties of the lake strata through high-resolution continuous measurements of temperature profiles, novel water sampling methods, and observation of vertical profiles of salt crystallization. The diapycnal fluxes across the metalimnion were explained by Double Diffusion (DD) salt fingering driven by instability between warmer saltier water above cooler less salty water. The DD flux is associated with: (1) sharpening of the metalimnion from a 20 m wide transition in early summer, to staircase, ultimately merging to a single sharp sub-meter step, (2) salinity decline from the epilimnion starting from mid-summer synchronous with increasing salinity and temperature of the hypolimnion, and (3) active halite crystallization in the hypolimnion. We hypnotize that the salt fingering mechanism in saturated brines reveals a unique asymmetry; i.e., the descending cooling fingers become supersaturated and crystallize halite, whereas the ascending warming fingers becomes undersaturated. The DD flux in the Dead Sea is shown to be fundamental in the dynamics of stratification, providing a framework for general understanding DD flux in hypersaline environments. The finding that the epilimnion experiences seasonal halite undersaturation whereas the hypolimnion continuously precipitates salt by DD flux, has wide implications on the understanding of the dynamics of deposition of evaporitic rocks.					; Lensky‬‏, Nadav/AAL-7950-2021	, Nadav/0000-0002-4726-1668; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2016	61	4					1214	1231		10.1002/lno.10285	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10285													WOS:000383622900006

Shifting Diets of Lake Trout in Northeastern Lake Michigan	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Prey fish communities in Lake Michigan have been steadily changing, characterized by declines in both the quantity and quality of Alewife Alosa pseudoharengus. To evaluate concurrent changes in the diet of Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush in northeastern Lake Michigan, we analyzed stomach contents of Lake Trout caught during gill-net surveys and fishing tournaments from May through October 2016. We then compared the composition, on a wet-weight basis, of 2016 diets with those previously described in a recent survey conducted in 2011. Overall, we found that Lake Trout diets in 2016 consisted mostly (94% by wet weight) of Alewives and Round Goby Neogobius melanostomus. Averaging across May through October, 61% of the Lake Trout diet consisted of Alewives. A clear seasonal shift was apparent: the diet was dominated by Round Goby (67%) during May-June, whereas Alewives dominated the diet (76%) during July-October. Seasonal dominance of Round Goby in spring Lake Trout diets has not been previously observed in northeastern Lake Michigan as Round Goby represented only 21% of the Lake Trout diet in spring of 2011. Diet composition of Lake Trout caught in gill nets did not significantly differ from diet composition of Lake Trout caught by anglers in either the May-June period or the July-October period. Although Lake Trout showed increased diet flexibility in 2016 compared with 2011, Alewives were still the predominant diet component during 2016, despite reduced Alewife biomass throughout Lake Michigan. Nonetheless, this further evidence of diet plasticity suggests that Lake Trout may be resilient to ongoing and future forage base changes.

A wide range of severe weather was reported, including heavy snowfall; freezing rain and drizzle; thunderstorms with destructive winds, lightning, large hail, and tornadoes; prolonged heavy rain with subsequent flooding; frost damage to citrus orchards; and sustained destructive winds not associated with thunderstorms. Low-end preliminary estimates of impacts included 9 deaths, 27 injuries, and $120 million of property damage. At least 35 states and southeastern Canada were adversely affected.

A 12,000 kyr paleohydroclimate record in the southeastern, USA based on deuterium from bat guano	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The southeastern United States endures environmental change from human population increase, climate change, and land-use alterations creating the need to understand baseline conditions and environmental patterns prior to human impacts. While paleoenvironmental data can be reconstructed from a variety of archives (e.g., lake sediments, tree rings, speleothems), some geographic areas contain fewer such records. One archive capable of recording moisture regimes and other paleoenvironmental changes over millennia but has received little attention relative to other climate proxies is bat guano deposits in cave systems. Bat guano deposits are found in many cave environments in the southeastern United States and can be used as an archive of paleoenvironmental data including precipitation, vegetation, and aspects associated with the ecology of bats. Here, we present a 12,000-year record of paleoenvironmental change based on delta H-2 stable isotopes in a guano core collected from Cave Springs Cave in Alabama, USA. Results suggest distinct shifts in moisture with dryer conditions during the early Holocene/late Pleistocene (12,200-9500 cal year BP) (delta H-2 values - 86.82 to --77.70), wetter conditions during the middle Holocene (9300-3900 cal year BP) (delta H-2 values - 125.74 to - 80.63), roughly coinciding with the Holocene Climatic Optimum event time interval (9000-5000 cal year BP). During the last 4000 years, conditions in the region shifted in the southeastern United States region becoming dryer once again. Climate inferences based on guano delta H-2 are consistent with the role of atmospheric moisture on regional vegetation changes suggested by previous pollen records obtained from lake sediment cores. This study suggests bat guano delta H-2 may be a reliable method to provide a long-term paleoclimate record.					; Tsalickis, Alexandra/HHM-5472-2022	Waters, Matthew/0000-0003-1702-3973; Campbell, Josh/0000-0001-9314-9119; Tsalickis, Alexandra/0000-0002-5643-5551													1866-6280	1866-6299				MAR	2022	81	5							148	10.1007/s12665-022-10234-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-022-10234-x													WOS:000759605700003

Prioritising areas for soil conservation measures in small agricultural catchments in Norway, using a connectivity index	GEODERMA												Measures designed to control erosion serve two purposes: on site (reduce soil loss) and off site (reduce sediment delivery to streams and lakes). While these objectives often coincide or at least are complementary, they could result in different priority areas when spatial planning is concerned. Prioritising for soil loss reduction at the field level will single out areas with high erosion risk. When sediment flux at the catchment scale is concerned, sediment pathways need to be identified in ex ante analyses of soil conservation plans. In Norway, different subsidy schemes are in place to reduce the influx of solutes and sediments to the freshwater system. Financial support is given to agronomic measures, the most important of which is reduced autumn tillage where areas with higher erosion risk receive higher subsidies. The objectives of this study are (1) to assess the use of an index of connectivity to estimate specific sediment yields, and (2) to test whether conservation measures taken in critical source areas are more effective than those taken at where erosion risk levels are the highest. Different modelling approaches are combined to assess soil loss at catchment level from sheet and gully erosion and soil losses through the drainage system. A calibration on two parameters gave reasonable results for annual soil loss. This model calibration was then used to quantify the effectiveness of three strategies for spatial prioritisation: according to hydrological connectivity, sheet erosion risk level and estimated specific sediment yield. The latter two strategies resulted in a maximum reduction in total soil loss due to reduced autumn tillage of 10%. Both model performance and the effectiveness of the different prioritisation strategies varied between the study catchments.

Downstream Passage of Lake Sturgeon through a Hydroelectric Generating Station: Route Determination, Survival, and Fine-Scale Movements	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Downstream passage of Lake Sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens through hydroelectric facilities is known to occur but is poorly understood. Acoustic telemetry was used to investigate downstream-passage routes, survival, and fine-scale movements at the Slave Falls Generating Station, located on the Winnipeg River, Manitoba. Downstream-passage rates were estimated at 2.9% (range = 0.0-4.4%) per year for Slave Falls Reservoir adults and 21.1% (range = 19.3-22.9%) per year for subadults tagged in the lowermost section of the reservoir. No juvenile passage was observed. Lake Sturgeon movements immediately upstream of the Slave Falls Generating Station main sluiceway gates were related to bathymetric features. Fish that approached via deepwater habitat tended to abandon their downstream trajectory movements before or upon reaching the top of a relatively shallow (similar to 10 m depth) bedrock saddle that occurs similar to 45 m upstream of the main sluiceway gates. Based on acoustic telemetry (fine-scale tracking and presence-absence data) and supplemental information, such as trash rack spacing and spill conditions, 7 of 11 (64%) observed downstream-passage events were concluded to have occurred via bottom-draw regulating sluices located in the northeastern end of the powerhouse. At least 91% of the observed downstream-passage events were survived. Results suggest that protection initiatives at hydroelectric facilities could exploit the Lake Sturgeon's bottom-oriented nature, with bottom-draw sluice gates likely providing a feasible way to facilitate safe downstream passage.

J	Engels, S; van Geel, B				Engels, Stefan; van Geel, Bas			The effects of changing solar activity on climate: contributions from palaeoclimatological studies	JOURNAL OF SPACE WEATHER AND SPACE CLIMATE												Natural climate change currently acts in concert with human-induced changes in the climate system. To disentangle the natural variability in the climate system and the human-induced effects on the global climate, a critical analysis of climate change in the past may offer a better understanding of the processes that drive the global climate system. In this review paper, we present palaeoclimatological evidence for the past influence of solar variability on Earth's climate, highlighting the effects of solar forcing on a range of timescales. On a decadal timescale, instrumental measurements as well as historical records show the effects of the 11-year Schwabe cycle on climate. The variation in total solar irradiance that is associated with a Schwabe cycle is only similar to 1 W m(-2) between a solar minimum and a maximum, but winter and spring temperatures on the Northern Hemisphere show a response even to this small-scale variability. There is a large body of evidence from palaeoclimatic reconstructions that shows the influence of solar activity on a centennial to millennial timescale. We highlight a period of low solar activity starting at 2800 years before present when Europe experienced a shift to colder and wetter climate conditions. The spatial pattern of climate change that can be recognized in the palaeoclimatological data is in line with the suggested pattern of climate change as simulated by climate models. Millennial-scale climate oscillations can be recognized in sediment records from the Atlantic Ocean as well as in records of lake-level fluctuations in southeastern France. These oscillations coincide with variation in C-14 production as recognized in the atmospheric C-14 record (which is a proxy-record for solar activity), suggesting that Earth's climate is sensitive to changes in solar activity on a millennial timescale as well.

J	Ekvall, MK; Hansson, LA				Ekvall, Mattias K.; Hansson, Lars-Anders			Differences in Recruitment and Life-History Strategy Alter Zooplankton Spring Dynamics Under Climate-Change Conditions	PLOS ONE												In recent decades temperature elevation has been the focus of many studies on climate change, including effects on planktonic communities, but few studies have examined the effects of increased water color ("brownification"). Since these changes are likely to occur simultaneously, it is important to investigate their potential interactive effects. Accordingly, we performed a mesocosm experiment where we combined a 3 degrees C increase in temperature with a doubling in water color to study how these factors affect zooplankton. In particular, we looked at recruitment of cladocerans and copepods from the sediment in spring, as well as their establishment in the water column. Our results show that an elevated temperature will have considerable effects on recruitment as well as on pelagic abundances of both cladocerans and copepods, whereas increases in water color will have less effects on the recruitment and pelagic establishment. But more importantly, the proportion of cladocerans in the water column, relative to copepods, increased at higher temperature, suggesting that cladocerans benefit more from elevated temperatures than copepods do. Overall, these results likely stem from the combined effect of changes in recruitment and differences in life history between copepods and cladocerans. Taking a wider outlook, this suggests that future climate warming will change the dominance pattern of zooplankton communities in spring, and, in accordance with the experimental data, we here show that cladocerans are more abundant than copepods in natural lake ecosystems during warmer rather than cooler years.					; Hansson, Lars-Anders/HCI-2735-2022	Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317; 													1932-6203					SEP 6	2012	7	9							e44614	10.1371/journal.pone.0044614	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0044614								22970267					WOS:000308458400095
J	Roy, GR				Roy, Gavin R.			The role of lake effect snow cover in reducing the susceptibility of Miscanthus X giganteus to extreme cold soil temperatures in Michigan	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Miscanthus xgiganteus (hereafter "M. x giganteus") is a low-input, highly productive perennial grass increasingly grown in the US Midwest for conversion into cellulosic ethanol. M. x giganteus must be propagated rhizomatously because it is a sterile hybrid, and because it is a perennial crop, mass die-offs may take two to three years to recover fully. This leads to economic loss and interruption of bioenergy supply. Several experimental M. xgiganteus crops in Illinois and Wisconsin experienced mass mortality due to extreme cold soil temperatures in the winter of 2008-2009. During this same winter, experimental M. xgiganteus crops in Michigan experienced little to no mortality. It is hypothesized that the insulating effect of increased snow depth and duration due to lake effect snowfall is sufficient to reduce the risk of cold-induced M. xgiganteus mortality in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, where the opportunity cost of farmland is also lower than in other parts of the US Midwest Observations of air and soil temperatures from experimental M. xgiganteus plots in Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan are analyzed during periods of snow cover and no snow cover in two anomalously cold winters, and a synoptic analysis is also presented. It is found that the absolute difference between the shallow soil temperature and air temperature was 3-7 degrees C greater when there was at least 2.5 cm of snow on the ground at these sites. However, shallow soil temperatures were observed to drop below laboratory mortality temperature thresholds of M xgiganteus (-3 degrees C and -6.5 degrees C) despite snow cover, demonstrating that snowfall alone should not be relied upon to sufficiently insulate M. xgiganteus rhizomes during their winter dormancy. Additionally, seven winters of shallow soil temperature observations at 12 sites in Michigan are compared with satellite-derived estimates of snow cover and it is shown that increased snow cover depth may not lead to decreased likelihood of soil temperatures below 3 degrees C.

In order to understand the scattering mechanism of lake ice, a scattering model is developed for lake ice that updates some assumptions adopted in previously developed models, including the roughness of the ice-water interface and the shape of vertically stacked centimeter-sized bubbles in the lake ice. We conclude the following: First, with a incidence angle range near 24 degrees, the backscattering intensities of C-band W-polarized. ENVISAT-ASAR data exhibit a strong dependence on time, which is related to the processes of ice growth and decay on the QTP. Some unique backscattering characteristics of lake ice in this high-altitude region, as compared to those for high-latitude regions, are also discussed and documented in the paper. Secondly, the timing of lake ice-on in fall and ice-off in spring for this region can be identified in radar images by using a threshold of -12 dB for the backscatter intensity of the surrounding alpine meadow. Finally, the results of applying the scattering model indicate that surface scattering from the ice-water interface and volume scattering from gas bubbles embedded in the lake ice are the dominant scattering mechanisms for C-band VV polarized SAR and that the roughness of the ice-water interface and also bubble size are the most sensitive factors.

J	TASH, JC; ARMITAGE, KB				TASH, JC; ARMITAGE, KB			ECOLOGY OF ZOOPLANKTON OF CAPE THOMPSON AREA ALASKA	ECOLOGY												In a survey of the physicochemical characteristics, primary productivity and occurrence of zooplankton in fresh and brackish waters at Cape Thompson, Alaska, between June 28, 1960 and Aug 7, 1961, 14 species of Cladocera and 38 species of Copepoda (13 Calanoida, 11 Cyclopoida and 14 Harpacticoida) were distinguished in collections from 10 lakes, 8 lagoons and 111 pools. Seventy-three % of all species were monocyclic; 13% dicyclic; 9% tricyclic; and 4% tetracyclic. The maximum of primary production was correlated with maximal numbers of zooplankton, maximal number of eggs per ovigerous female in the Cladocera, and maximal occurrence of copepodids. Many Copepoda produced eggs in late fall and early winter when primary production was low. Autumnal production of eggs by these species may be possible because of storage of energy as lipids during the period of high environmental energy, and use of the stored energy at the end of the developmental period to form eggs. Analysis of community structure among zooplankton showed: 10 species with affinities and 7 interrelated recurrent groups occurred in the lakes; 3 species with affinities and 1 recurrent group occurred in the lagoons; 4 species with affinities and 3 interrelated recurrent groups occurred in the coastal pools; and no species with affinities occurred in the inland pools. One cladoceran, 1 cyclopoid and 1 or 2 calanoid copepods of different genera formed the major recurrent groups. The relationships between recurrent groups were the result of species within those related groups having similar distribution and overlapping developmental cycles. Closely allied species occupied different aquatic habitats, but when congeneric species cooccurred, there were differences in size and life cycles.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1967	48	1					129	+		10.2307/1933424	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1933424													WOS:A19679143900013

Microbial nutrient limitation in Arctic lakes in a permafrost landscape of southwest Greenland	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Permafrost is degrading across regions of the Arctic, which can lead to increases in nutrient concentrations in surface freshwaters. The oligotrophic state of many Arctic lakes suggests that enhanced nutrient inputs may have important effects on these systems, but little is known about microbial nutrient limitation patterns in these lakes. We investigated microbial extracellular enzyme activities (EEAs) to infer seasonal nutrient dynamics and limitation across 24 lakes in southwest Greenland during summer (June and July). From early to late summer, enzyme activities that indicate microbial carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) demand increased in both the epilimnia and hypolimnia by 74% on average. Microbial investment in P acquisition was generally higher than that for N. Interactions among EEAs indicated that microbes were primarily P-limited. Dissolved organic matter (DOM, measured as dissolved organic carbon) was strongly and positively correlated with microbial P demand (R-2 = 0.84 in July), while there were no relationships between DOM and microbial N demand. Microbial P limitation in June epilimnia (R-2 = 0.67) and July hypolimnia (R-2 = 0.57) increased with DOM concentration. The consistency of microbial P limitation from June to July was related to the amount of DOM present, with some low-DOM lakes becoming N-limited in July. Our results suggest that future changes in P or DOM inputs to these lakes are likely to alter microbial nutrient limitation patterns.					; Simon, Kevin/CAH-1516-2022	Simon, Kevin/0000-0002-9537-2450; Northington, Robert/0000-0002-1347-0971													1726-4170	1726-4189					2016	13	2					365	374		10.5194/bg-13-365-2016	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-365-2016													WOS:000369524500001

A half-million-year record of paleoclimate from the Lake Manix Core, Mojave Desert, California	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Pluvial lakes in the southwestern U.S. responded sensitively to past climate through effects on rainfall, runoff, and evaporation. Although most studies agree that pluvial lakes in the southwestern U.S. reached their highest levels coeval with glacial stages, the specific timing of increased effective moisture and lake-level rise is debated, particularly for the southwesternmost lakes. We obtained a 45-m core of lacustrine sediment from Lake Manix, the former terminus of the Mojave River prior to about 25 ka, and supplemented data from the core with outcrop studies. These sediments provide a robust record of Mojave River discharge over the last half-million years. Lake Manix persisted from OIS 12 through early OIS 2, including during interstadial OIS 3 and interglacials OIS 5, 7, and 9. The ostracode faunal record displays a shift from an unexpectedly warm, summer-dominated lake hydrology during OIS 12 to predominantly colder, winter-dominated conditions afterwards. The ostracode-based stable isotope record displays a large degree of intra-sample variability and does not mimic other well-known isotopic records of climate change. Evaporation likely buffered the Manix delta O-18 record from most of the expected isotopic differences between interglacial and glacial-interval discharge. Isotopically depleted and stable lakes occurred only four to six times, most notably during OIS 7 and OIS 9. Internal drainage-basin changes also affected the isotopic record. Persistence of lakes in the Manix basin during interglacials requires atmospheric or oceanic circulation controls on the mean position of the Pacific storm track other than large ice sheets. We propose that the relative strength and sign of the Northern Annular Mode (NAM) and its influence on atmospheric river-derived precipitation is a potential explanation.

Describing the fragment mass distribution in meteorite showers	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE												The mass distribution of fragments is an important characteristic that often needs to be defined for forward modelling the interaction of disrupted meteoroids and asteroids with the atmosphere, and which can be inferred to some extent by the distribution of meteorites that fell to the ground. In previous studies, we derived a formula for the mass distribution of fragments of a disrupted body assuming a power law for the distribution in a differential form, and applied this formula to describe the results of many impact experiments modelling fragmentation of asteroids in outer space. The formula represents the cumulative number of fragments as a function of the fragment mass normalized to the total mass, the mass fraction of the largest fragment and the power index, which is the only free parameter adjusted to best fit the analytical distribution to the empirical one. Here, we use the proposed formula to describe the mass distributions of recovered meteorites that fell to the ground after the passage and disruption of thirteen extraterrestrial objects in the atmosphere, as well as the mass distributions of fragments of meteorite samples disrupted in impact experiments. A comparison is made between the distributions of unevaporated fragments of bodies disrupted in the atmosphere and the distributions obtained after the disruption of bodies in experiments. Some regularities in meteorite distributions and the influence of the incompleteness of the available collection of meteorites on their mass distribution are discussed.

Quantification of the impact of macrophytes on oxygen dynamics and nitrogen retention in a vegetated lowland river	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												When macrophytes are growing in the river, the vegetation induces substantial changes to the water quality. Some effects are the result of direct interactions, such as photosynthetic activity or nutrient uptake, whereas others may be attributed to indirect effects of the water plants on hydrodynamics and river processes. This research focused on the direct effect of macrophytes on oxygen dynamics and nutrient cycling. Discharge, macrophyte biomass density, basic water quality, dissolved oxygen and nutrient concentrations were in situ monitored throughout the year in a lowland river (Nete catchment, Belgium). In addition, various processes were investigated in more detail in multiple ex situ experiments. The field and aquaria measurement results clearly demonstrated that aquatic plants can exert considerable impact on dissolved oxygen dynamics in a lowland river. When the river was dominated by macrophytes, dissolved oxygen concentrations varied from 5 to 10 mg l(-1). Considering nutrient retention, it was shown that the investigated in-stream macrophytes could take up dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) from the water column at rates of 33-50 mg N kg(dry matter)(-1) h(-1). And DIN fluxes towards the vegetation were found to vary from 0.03 to 0.19 g N ha(-1) h(-1) in spring and summer. Compared to the measured changes in DIN load over the river stretch, it means that about 3-13% of the DIN retention could be attributed to direct nitrogen uptake from the water by macrophytes. Yet, the role of macrophytes in rivers should not be underrated as aquatic vegetation also exerts considerable indirect effects that may have a greater impact than the direct fixation of nutrients into the plant biomass.

Recent ecological change in a remote Scottish mountain loch: An evaluation of a Cladocera-based temperature transfer-function	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY					International Open Science Conference on Global Change in Mountain Regions	OCT 02-06, 2005	Perth, SCOTLAND					Recent ecological changes in a small Scottish mountain loch, Loch Coire Fionnaraich (LCFR), were inferred using Cladocera analysis and an application of a Cladocera-based temperature transfer-function approach. Modem assemblages of Cladocera from 68 mountain lakes in Scotland and Norway were used to derive the transfer function. Among 21 measured environmental variables, mean summer lake surface-water temperature (LSWT) accounted for the highest (8%) variation in a redundancy analysis of the modem data. A quantitative inference model (r(2) = 0.72, RMSEP = 1.81 degrees C) for summer LSWT was developed using linear partial least squares regression and calibration. The resulting reconstructed summer LSWT at LCFR was compared with local instrumental air-temperature records over the last 20 yr and the Central England Temperature (CET) series over the last 110 yr. The reconstruction showed a broadly similar pattern to the local instrumental temperature records. However, the relationship between the longer CET series and reconstructed summer LSWT was poor suggesting that the site was relatively insensitive to temperature changes prior to the recent warming of the last few decades. Clear changes in Cladoceran species diversity and relative abundance of littoral taxa coincident with the most recent period of climate warming recorded both locally and in the CET suggest that Cladocera do respond to climate change. However, their response to temperature is complex and indirect. The underlying mechanism leading to change in Cladocera assemblages may involve changes in trophic status and habitat availability of the system. It is concluded that understanding other factors such as atmospheric pollution, controls of community dynamics of Cladocera and the overall ecological complexity of mountain lakes is required before any reliance can be placed on a Cladocera-temperature transfer-function for reconstructing climatic change.

Modern assemblages and transfer functions	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												An analysis of modern phytolith assemblages is presented. Phytolith assemblages were studied in modern surface soils and sediments of 28 sites from east Otago, New Zealand, within a range of vegetation types and microclimates. No simple distinction could be made between vegetation types on the basis of phytolith assemblage composition. A Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of the phytolith data set revealed that festucoid, chloridoid and spherical phytolith morphotypes formed strong associations with sites from wetland, grassland, and forest vegetation types, respectively. More importantly, a comparison of sample replicates from each field site using Squared Chord Distance (SCD) assemblage analysis showed that wetland and grassland sites tended to produce more internally consistent phytolith assemblages than forest sites. Environmental variables including pH, conductivity, altitude, precipitation and temperature were also gathered for each site. The ability of each environmental variable to reflect variance in the entire phytolith data set was estimated by a series of Redundancy Analyses (RDA) with Monte Carlo permutation tests of statistical significance. After a forward selection process, transfer functions were generated using Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression and calibration with jack-knife validation. The final transfer functions have root mean squared errors of prediction for pH (0.47), log conductivity (0.38 muS cm), average annual precipitation (63 mm), and average annual (0.28degreesC), spring (0.38degreesC) and autumn temperature (0.41degreesC); the smallest group of environmental variables explaining the most variance in the modern phytolith data set. The most useful transfer functions for application to fossil phytolith data and paleoenvironmental interpretation are pH, log conductivity and annual precipitation. The relationship between changes in pH and annual precipitation and phytolith assemblage composition found in this study presents a prima facie relationship with the potential to provide direct proxies for soil weathering and indirectly for paleoenvironmental reconstruction.					shulmeister, james/J-2859-2015; Shulmeister, James/J-2859-2015	shulmeister, james/0000-0001-5863-9462; Prebble, Matthew/0000-0001-8577-7190; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				MAY	2002	27	4					393	413		10.1023/A:1020318803497	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1020318803497													WOS:000178211900001

Fortunately, some measures to save the Aral Sea have been proposed. Regional climate model ALARO-SURFEX was applied in dynamic downscaling simulations to quantify the climatic effects generated by increasing greenhousegas (GHG) emissions and the Aral Sea restoration. The results show that performance of CNRM-CM5 dynamically downscaled by ALARO-SURFEX in reproducing 2-m temperature is reliable and better than outputs of 17 global climate models. If the Aral Sea kept the almost dry-up state (8.6 x 103 km(2)) in the future (2021-2050), the Aral Sea region will suffer a warmer summer than in historical period. Daily maximum (T2max), mean (T2avg), and minimum (T2min) temperature will rise by 0.91 degrees C, 1.06 degrees C, and 1.22 degrees C, respectively, and reduce diurnal temperature range (DTR) by 0.31 degrees C. If the Aral Sea could recover to twice its current area (17.2 x 103 km(2)), the T2max and T2avg (T2min) over the ambient region of Aral Sea (350 km) will reduce (increase) by 1.54 and 1.10 degrees C (1.16 degrees C), respectively, which can dampen the DTR by 2.4 degrees C. The cooling effect induced by the projected Aral Sea restoration is mainly contributed by enhanced latent heat. While the warming effect caused by GHG emissions increase is primarily attributed to increased incoming longwave radiation. This study quantified the summer cooling effect under the projected restoration of Aral Sea, which could provide scientific reference in working out the sustainable development strategies under the warming threat in Central Asia.

Observational analysis reveals that the Chicago core urban area consistently experience more precipitation than the adjacent southern Lake Michigan region throughout the year, particularly before 2015. This disparity has narrowed since 2016 due to a more rapid increase in heavy precipitation over the lake compared to the urban area. Specifically, lake precipitation has risen by 18.6 mm per year, compared to11.5 mm per year over the urban area in warm-season (April-October). Additionally, the number of days with precipitation exceeding 5 mm has been rising at a rate of 0.82 days per year over the lake and 0.42 days per year over urban areas. Ensemble modeling experiments reveal that both urbanization and lake effects enhance precipitation over the urban area, primarily through convergence with sufficient moisture, driven by interactions between land and lake breezes, a warm surface layer, and a low lifted condensation level. In contrast, these factors suppress precipitation over the lake. The suppression results from Lake Michigan's stable environment, characterized by cooler surface temperatures, limited evaporation in early summer, and a high-pressure anomaly over the lake driven by urban heating, which creates upward motion over urban areas and downward motion over the lake, further influencing precipitation patterns.

The role of environmental variables and sympatric meso-carnivores on the detection and occupancy of American mink during winter	HYSTRIX-ITALIAN JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY												The spatial distributions of animals generally are affected by the availability of food, competition, predators, mates, and the need to communicate with conspecifics. An understanding of a given species' spatial distribution is essential when considering the ecological requirements of populations as well as the impacts of anthropogenic activities and environmental change. The American mink (Neovison vison) is a cryptic, semi-aquatic carnivore that ranges over a large portion of North America yet the ecological role of the species is not well understood. We sought to investigate the linkages between habitat and species co-occurrence on the occupancy patterns of mink within riparian habitats during winter. We monitored mink using remote cameras (n=37) which were deployed in riparian habitat along streams including lakeshore/stream confluences. We found that fish-bearing streams positively affected mink occupancy, while the amount of older (> 40 years) coniferous forests had a negative relationship with mink occupancy. We postulate that while mink seem to occur at high densities in altered ecosystems and in areas where they are invasive, in their native range these animals may be limited by environmental and competitive pressures in the system. Future work should explore the interactions between carnivore species in addition to habitat selection in order to develop more robust monitoring and management practices.																			0394-1914	1825-5272					2017	28	1					16	20		10.4404/hystrix-28.1-11437	http://dx.doi.org/10.4404/hystrix-28.1-11437													WOS:000453848100003

Motion of water in an ice-covered shallow lake	WATER RESOURCES												The results of analysis of data collected by direct measurements of currents in shallow Vendyurskoe Lake in winter are given. The horizontal motions of water in the lake are shown to exist throughout the freeze up period. Dominating frequencies are identified in variations in water motion with periods close to those of the longitudinal and transverse seiches of the lake. Experiments are used to show that oscillatory motions of ice can serve a source of energy for the development of water mass movement in ice-covered lakes. Wind is shown to be the most likely factor generating oscillatory motions of water in ice-covered lakes. It is shown that the velocities of residual currents existing in a lake decrease in winter and their maximum values occur above the deep-water part of the lake within the first and second months of freeze-up.

J	Ang, WJ; Park, E; Yang, XK				Ang, Wei Jing; Park, Edward; Yang, Xiankun			Geomorphic control on stage-area hysteresis in three of the largest floodplain lakes	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Hysteresis in floodplain lakes occurs between stage and lake area. Stage-area hysteresis controls the storage and exchange of water and sediments, and is a critical hydrological behavior for lake management. While hysteresis has been repeatedly observed in the floodplain lakes of large rivers, the hydrological mechanism and factors in control have been poorly understood thus far. In this paper, we investigate the role of geomorphology in controlling lake hysteresis, specifically the geologic setting and the lake basin, the lake position relative to the main stem of the river, as well as the influence of lake shape and its internal depositional landforms on inundation dynamics. We study the floodplain lakes along three of the largest rivers around the world: the Curuai Lake of the Amazon River, the Tonle Sap Lake of the Mekong River, and the Poyang Lake of the Yangtze River. The three lakes exhibit a similar counter-clockwise stage-area hysteresis: for a given stage, the lake area is larger in the falling season than in the rising season. Our results indicate that hysteresis is mainly controlled by geomorphology, where the lake shape and basin size lead to delays in the drainage and drop in lake area during the falling season, resulting in counter-clockwise hysteresis. Nevertheless, the lakes are of distinct climatic and geologic-geomorphic settings, representing the variety in the lake types of large rivers. Hence, while geomorphology is the overall driver, unique lake characteristics delay the fall in water extent and shape hysteresis on a case-by-case nature. At Curuai, the complex floodplain morphology (impeded floodplain) complicates and slows the routing of outflow. At Tonle Sap, the lake flows into the river solely through a narrow channel, where a backwater effect restricts drainage. At Poyang, the wide lake shape upstream leads to counter-clockwise hysteresis, while the narrow channel downstream exhibits clockwise hysteresis. Out of the three investigated floodplains, Tonle Sap has the largest degree of hysteresis (0.41), followed by Poyang (0.17) and Curuai (0.13). This trend in hysteresis extent is a result of the different composition of inflow and the lake-river hydrological connectivity, attributed to lake geomorphology. This study is the first to address geomorphology as the primary control over lake hysteresis, which improves understanding of the stage-area curve in empirical and numerical hydrological models, and potentially floodplain management.					; Park, Edward/JCD-7857-2023	Park, Edward/0000-0002-1299-1724; Ang, Wei Jing/0000-0002-5455-0054; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				NOV	2022	614		B						128574	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128574	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128574		NOV 2022											WOS:000883789700001

In its permanently stratified hypolimnion, unusually high methane concentrations have increased further in recent decades. Because methanogenesis is, in part, dependent on supply of organic material from the photic zone, it is necessary to quantify upward nutrient fluxes from the saline, nutrient-rich deep waters. These upward fluxes are mainly driven by advection caused by subaquatic springs. Biogenic calcite precipitation drives surface-water depletion and deep-water enrichment of Ca(2+), Sr(2+), and Ba(2+). Methane is mainly oxidized aerobically at the redox interface at 60 m, with a small contribution of anaerobic methane oxidation. A subaquatic spring that sustains the major chemocline at 250 m depth was depleted of N, P, and CH(4), and concentrations of major ions were slightly lower than in the lake water of the same depth. Enrichment of the deep waters with nutrients and CH(4) are driven by mineralization of settling organic material, whereas SiO(2) is influenced by uptake and mineralization of diatoms and inputs through subaquatic springs. Dissolved inorganic phosphorus and Si fluxes supplied by internal loading through upwelling were found to be lower than the estimations for Lakes Malawi and Tanganyika. In contrast, N flux was within the lower range for Lake Malawi, whereas it was assumed to be totally lost by denitrification in Lake Tanganyika. In Lake Kivu, nutrient uptake by primary production is three times higher than nutrient upward fluxes.

Diatom sequences indicate orbital and millennial-scale variability in water level and salinity. The pelagic freshwater diatom species Cyclotella andina and Cyclotella stelligera dominate Glacial-age sediments, suggesting that the lake was above its present outlet. Generally, wet conditions continued until 11 000 cal yr BP, as indicated by high percentages of freshwater planktonic diatoms. Large pulses of benthic diatom species between about 11 000 and 10 000 cal yr BP suggest brief intervals of large-amplitude declines in lake level. During the early Holocene (10 000-8500 cal yr BP), a freshwater diatom assemblage suggests overflowing conditions. Pelagic freshwater diatoms are replaced ca. 8500 cal yr BP by the salinity-indifferent species Cyclotella meneghiniana and by benthic taxa, indicating the beginning of lake regression. During the mid-Holocene (6000-3500 cal yr BP), the abundance of the saline taxon Chaetoceros muelleri, coupled with high abundances of epiphytic and epipelic diatoms, indicates maximum salinity and lowest lake levels in the entire 30000 year record. Lake transgression began ca. 4000 cal yr BP, and the lake achieved modem levels by about 1500 cal yr BP. These water-level changes imply changes in effective moisture, most likely resulting from large precipitation changes. Precipitation was high throughout the Last Glacial Maximum (21 000-18 000 cal yr BP), likely due to an enhanced South American Summer Monsoon during peak summer insolation in the Southern Hemisphere. In contrast, the mid-Holocene transition was dryer than today in association with an austral summer insolation minimum and the subsequent weakening of the summer monsoon.

J	WARREN, LA; ZIMMERMAN, AP				WARREN, LA; ZIMMERMAN, AP			THE INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE AND NACL ON CADMIUM, COPPER AND ZINC PARTITIONING AMONG SUSPENDED PARTICULATE AND DISSOLVED PHASES IN AN URBAN RIVER	WATER RESEARCH												Distribution coefficients (K-d) were used to estimate the most important geochemical phases within the suspended particulate matter (SPM) pool for sorption of Cd, Cu and Zn. Given that pH effects were expected to be minimal, as the Don is a well buffered system, the possible influence of secondary environmental variables [temperature, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved Ca2+ and NaCl] on trace metal partitioning between SPM and the dissolved phase was evaluated using a series of multiple linear regressions for total (KdT)as well as the phase specific (K(d)L leachable phase; K(d)R reducible phase; and KdO oxidizable phase) distribution coefficient estimates. The three metals varied in their sorptions patterns. Cd and Zn showed the same relative affinities for three SPM pools (leachable = reducible > oxidizable), while Cu affinities ranked oxidizable = leachable > reducible. Secondary environmental factors were identified as more important influences on trace metal partitioning than pH. Temperature and NaCl (from road salt runoff) were found to be key environmental variables influencing trace metal partitioning. A decrease in water temperature caused decreases in the accumulation of Cd, Cu and Zn in the particulate pool. Increasing NaCl concentrations decreased the concentrations of Cd and Zn associated with the particulate leachable phase and the Cd, Zn and Cu content in the oxidizable SPM phase. These results suggest that in running waters during winter months, or even during summer months in the hypolimnia of sufficiently deep lakes, a relatively higher proportion of these metals remains in the dissolved and potentially more bioavailable pool.																			0043-1354					SEP	1994	28	9					1921	1931		10.1016/0043-1354(94)90167-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(94)90167-8													WOS:A1994NW95000008
J	Tada, Y; Grossart, HP				Tada, Yuya; Grossart, Hans-Peter			Community shifts of actively growing lake bacteria after N-acetyl-glucosamine addition: improving the BrdU-FACS method	ISME JOURNAL												In aquatic environments, community dynamics of bacteria, especially actively growing bacteria (AGB), are tightly linked with dissolved organic matter (DOM) quantity and quality. We analyzed the community dynamics of DNA-synthesizing and accordingly AGB by linking an improved bromodeoxyuridine immunocytochemistry approach with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (BrdU-FACS). FACS-sorted cells of even oligotrophic ecosystems in winter were characterized by 16S rRNA gene analysis. In incubation experiments, we examined community shifts of AGB in response to the addition of N-acetyl-glucosamine (NAG), one of the most abundant aminosugars in aquatic systems. Our improved BrdU-FACS analysis revealed that AGB winter communities of oligotrophic Lake Stechlin (northeastern Germany) substantially differ from those of total bacteria and consist of Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, Deltaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Candidatus OP10 and Chloroflexi. AGB populations with different BrdU-fluorescence intensities and cell sizes represented different phylotypes suggesting that single-cell growth potential varies at the taxon level. NAG incubation experiments demonstrated that a variety of widespread taxa related to Alpha-, Beta-, Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Planctomycetes, Spirochaetes, Verrucomicrobia and Chloroflexi actively grow in the presence of NAG. The BrdU-FACS approach enables detailed phylogenetic studies of AGB and, thus, to identify those phylotypes which are potential key players in aquatic DOM cycling.

Comparative biogeography of volant and nonvolant mammals in a temperate island archipelago	ECOSPHERE												Island biogeography theory is a foundational ecological concept that describes how island or habitat patch size and isolation predict biodiversity, but few have studied how the effects of island biogeography vary with life history characteristics of temperate mammal communities. From 2014 to 2020, we surveyed volant and nonvolant mammals within the Apostle Islands archipelago (Wisconsin, USA) using camera trapping, live trapping, and acoustic monitoring. We used linear regression and information-theoretic model selection to evaluate the effects of island size and isolation on indices of biodiversity. We also examined the effects of life history characteristics (i.e., body mass, winter inactivity) on the relative abundance and distribution of each species on the islands and the mainland. For volant mammals, island size and isolation were not associated with any metrics of diversity. We found island size was positively associated with nonvolant mammal species richness and diversity, but not species evenness. Island isolation was not a significant predictor for small nonvolant mammal diversity, although both size and isolation appeared to influence island biogeography of medium-large nonvolant mammals. We also found that the interaction between winter inactivity and body mass influenced the vagility of nonvolant mammals in the archipelago. Our results suggest that life history characteristics are important in mediating species responses to biogeography, supporting the dispersal-limitation nonequilibrium view of island biogeography theory, particularly for nonvolant mammals.

Sites (2,215- to 2,300-m elevation) are characterized by shallow granitic soils, an Abies lasiocarpa /Pinus albicaulis overstory, and a Vaccinium scoparium understory. In fall 1995, plots were established at four campsites on three subalpine lakes in which soils were scarified, compost amended, and planted to native species. In summer 1998, we sampled surface soils (0-15 cm) on undisturbed sites (between and under vegetation) and unamended and compost-amended campsite soils. Samples were analyzed for total organic C, total N, potentially mineralizable N (PMN), NH4 , soil moisture, microbial biomass, basal 5-day respiration rates, and microbial community carbon utilization profiles. Unamended campsite soils had significantly lower levels of PMN, microbial biomass, basal respiration, and number of substrates metabolized in carbon utilization profiles. Compost addition elevated all these impacted parameters on campsite soils, although the increase in basal respiration rate was neither statistically significant nor sufficient to approach rates found underneath vegetation on undisturbed soils. Only the number of substrates metabolized in the carbon utilization profiles was significantly higher on compost-amended soils than on undisturbed soils. Levels of PMN indicate that campsite soils may lack sufficient N for rapid plant regeneration, whereas amended and undisturbed soils contained adequate quantities of available N. This work suggests that compost amendments can ameliorate impacts to soil chemistry and microbial populations caused by camping, without exceeding the N fertility found on undisturbed soils.

J	Van de Water, K; North, M				Van de Water, Kip; North, Malcolm			Fire history of coniferous riparian forests in the Sierra Nevada	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Fire is an important ecological process in many western U.S coniferous forests, yet high fuel loads, rural home construction and other factors have encouraged the suppression of most wildfires. Using mechanical thinning and prescribed burning, land managers often try to reduce fuels in strategic areas with the highest fuel loads Riparian forests, however, are often designated as areas where only limited management action can take place within a fixed-width zone These highly productive forests have developed heavy fuel loads capable of supporting stand-replacing crown fires that can alter wildlife habitat and ecosystem function, and contribute to stream channel erosion Objectives of this study were to determine whether adjacent coniferous riparian and upland forests burned historically with different frequencies and seasonalities, and whether these relationships varied by forest, site, and stream characteristics We measured dendrochronological fire records in adjacent riparian and upland areas across a variety of forest, site and stream conditions at 36 sites in three sampling areas in the northern Sierra Nevada Riparian fire return Intervals (FRI) ranged from 84 to 423 years under a liberal filter (mean 166). and 10.0 to 86.5 years under a conservative filter (mean 30 0) Upland FRI ranged from 6 1 to 58.0 years under a liberal filter (mean 169), and 10.0 to 563 years under a conservative filter (mean 27 8). Riparian and upland fire return intervals were significantly different in only one quarter of the sites we sampled Riparian and upland areas did not burn with different seasonalities. and fire events occurred primarily during the late summer-early fall dormant season in both riparian and upland areas (88% and 79% of scars. respectively) FRI was shorter in forests with a higher proportion (>22 7-37.6%) of fire-tolerant pine (Pious spp), sites east of the Sierra crest, lower elevation sites (<1944 m), and riparian zones bordering narrower, more incised streams (width/depth ratio <6 2) Upland areas exhibited a greater degree of fire-climate synchrony than riparian areas Our study suggests that Sierra Nevada coniferous riparian forests bordering many montane streams might be managed for fuel loads and fire return intervals similar to adjacent upland forests Published by Elsevier B V					; North, Malcolm/AAW-8897-2020	North, Malcolm/0000-0002-9090-784X; 													0378-1127	1872-7042				JUN 30	2010	260	3					384	395		10.1016/j.foreco.2010.04.032	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2010.04.032													WOS:000279582100018

In this study, we investigated the effects of dam impoundment from 2006 to 2011 on wetland plant communities and wintering water birds in Lashi Lake, a typical closed wetland in Northwest Yunnan, China. The surface area of the water body increased from 933 hm(2) before impoundment to 1262 hm(2) after impoundment; the area of meadows and emergent, submerged and floating vegetation increased from 1006 to 1149 hm(2). After the dam impoundment and with the rising water level, formerly dominant plant communities, such as Com. Phragmites australis, Com. Potamogeton pectinatus and Com. Nymphoides peltatum, disappeared. New communities, such as Com. Polygonum hydropiper, Com. Acorus calamus and Com. Leersia hexandra, rapidly expanded into the newly formed lakeside. During these changes, the species and number of wintering water birds slightly increased, but the populations and distributions of birds were altered. Some birds chose the newly formed lakeside as habitat, while others disappeared or decreased greatly. Notably, the major protected birds, such as species of Ciconia nigra, did not appear in the new area, and the species number of Grus grus decreased. The results showed that damming impacted wetland ecosystems. Given the importance and complexity of dam impoundment in alpine wetlands, the effects of food-chain modifications on plants, water birds, aquatic organisms, and humans could be extensive.

J	Hudak, DR; Nissen, R				Hudak, DR; Nissen, R			Doppler radar applications in major winter snowstorms	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												Two winter snowstorms in the Toronto area are investigated with an X-band Doppler radar. The scan strategy involved alternating volume scans and a vertically pointing mode. The Extended Velocity Azimuth Display (EVAD) technique was applied to the volume scan data to document mesoscale wind patterns. Moments of the Doppler power spectrum, namely the fall velocity (V-t) and the spectral width (sigma(w)), were derived from the vertically pointing data The variation of these moments in height and with time was used to deduce precipitation formation processes. In both cases low level convergence in the easterly flow across Lake Ontario ahead of the main disturbance was found. Here, accretion was very active. In the first case, strong convergence near the centre of the low as it passed overhead the radar was discerned. In this part of the storm, aggregation was the dominant precipitation mechanism. To the rear of the low, with neither an off-lake component to the flow nor consequential convergence aloft, diffusion increased in significance. In the second case, warm air overrunning an approaching warm front produced strong mid-level convergence. This resulted in significant accretion in the mid-levels such that a period of ice pellets was observed without the benefit of an above 0 degrees C layer aloft. Where convergence was weaker, aggregation became the dominant process. The approach used in this study enabled variations in the microphysics on the mesoscale to be deduced. The EVAD technique in the circumstances of almost complete radar coverage and slowly evolving fields was able to distinguish between low level local effects and synoptic scale aspects of the storms. Furthermore, the moments of the Doppler power were able to identify the occurrence of diffusion, aggregation, and accretion. Regions of the storm in which V-t > 1.75 m s(-1) or sigma(w) > 0.60 m s(-1) were associated with the accretion process. V-t > 1.25 m s(-1) was associated with aggregation; V-t < 1.00 m s(-1) was associated with diffusion. Spectral width was not generally a good discriminator between diffusion and aggregation. When 1.00 < V-t < 1.25 m s(-1), however, values of sigma(w) above 0.40 m s(-1) were more commonly associated with aggregation than diffusion. The profiles of V-t and sigma(w) within the different growth regimes give a more complete description of the precipitation process and can provide the basis of an improved understanding of the hydrometeor size spectrum.																			0169-8095					JUL	1996	41	2					109	130		10.1016/0169-8095(95)00072-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0169-8095(95)00072-0													WOS:A1996VA82000002
J	Smith, SA; Vosper, SB; Field, PR				Smith, S. A.; Vosper, S. B.; Field, P. R.			Sensitivity of orographic precipitation enhancement to horizontal resolution in the operational Met Office Weather forecasts	METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Rain gauge observations show that when averaged over a large number of cases of frontal systems passing over the UK, strong orographic rain enhancement occurs on the lee slopes of the first hills encountered by the southwesterly flow in the warm sector. The operational forecasts using 1.5 km grid spacing produced realistic looking mean rainfall patterns over the Lake District and Wales, with an area-averaged rain accumulation error of less than 2%. Model-level rain rates increase with decreasing altitude consistent with the seeder-feeder mechanism. Increasing the horizontal grid spacing in the operational weather forecast model decreases the amount of rain produced over the hills, thereby reducing forecast accuracy. The area-averaged rain accumulations are 11-24% smaller than observed at 12 km grid spacing and 33-48% smaller than observed at 40 km grid spacing. In additional simulations of the 15 January 2011 case over the Lake District at 1.5 km grid spacing, replacing the orography with that used by the 12 and 40 km models reduced the area-averaged rain accumulations by 10 and 23% respectively. These changes were due to reduced cloud water and ice mixing ratios over the lower hills resulting in slower increases in rain rate with decreasing altitude. It is demonstrated that neglecting the horizontal advection of falling rain drops results in too much rain falling on the windward slope and not enough falling on the lee slopes.

Our study focused on the investigation of mat- forming cyanobacteria produced in an artificial pool with a geothermal water source from a hot spring in Uniejo<acute accent>w, Poland. The microorganisms inhabiting this ecosystem tolerate the high salinity (approximately 50 parts per thousand) and temperature (45-55.2 degrees C) of the water. The structure, composition, and growth rates of the cyanobacterial mats were investigated under natural and laboratory conditions. We tested whether cyanobacteria harvested from this habitat represent a safe source of vital biomolecules for industrial applications. We found that the layered mats consisted of simple filamentous cyanobacteria, mainly of the genera Leptolyngbya, Thermoleptolyngbya, and Anagnostidinema. In the isolated cyanobacteria, we did not detect commonly studied cyanotoxins (i. e., ATX-a, BMAA, CYN, MC, and SXT) that could pose a direct risk to human health and lead to indirect risks through the contamination of bioproducts. The extracts and filtrates of the strains did not reduce the survival of Daphnia. . In addition, we found that temperatures of 40-50 degrees C and pH values of 7.2-7.7 were optimal for mat formation and the growth of the dominant cyanobacteria. In the case of the Desertifilum dzianense strain, the highest biomass yield was noted at 26 degrees C. In summary, our study indicates that mat-forming cyanobacteria inhabiting ecosystems powered by geothermal waters from the Uniejo<acute accent>w hot spring have strong potential as bioresources for different industrial applications.					; Wejnerowski, Łukasz/K-1886-2019; Rybak, Andrzej/J-2865-2012; Gąbka, Maciej/A-1415-2017; Rybak, Michał/AAC-1750-2022; Mankiewicz-Boczek, Joanna/J-2427-2018; Meriluoto, Jussi/A-5309-2008	Rybak, Michal/0000-0001-7957-184X; Rybak, Andrzej/0000-0001-7755-857X; Dziuba, Marcin/0000-0003-1803-4164; Jurczak, Tomasz/0000-0002-1576-6741; Mankiewicz-Boczek, Joanna/0000-0001-7358-0673; Meriluoto, Jussi/0000-0002-6300-301X													2211-9264					AUG	2024	82								103646	10.1016/j.algal.2024.103646	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2024.103646		AUG 2024											WOS:001306749500001
J	Middleton, GV				Middleton, GV			J.W. Spencer (1851-1921): His life in Missouri and Georgia, and work on proglacial lakes	GEOSCIENCE CANADA												In 1882, Spencer left Canada to become Professor of Geology and Mineralogy, and Director of the Natural History Museum at the State University of Missouri. His first task was to design and equip the new museum, part of a planned extension of the main university building. The museum was completed in 1884, but funding for specimens and furnishing was withheld as feuding between the administration and the State increased. In 1886, Spencer visited Europe, making observations in Norway which strengthened his belief that glaciers were ineffective agents of erosion. Spencer was forced to resign in 1887: he devoted that summer to intensive fieldwork in the Great Lakes region, tracing proglacial lake beaches. He was appointed Professor of Geology at the State University of Georgia in Athens in 1888 and devoted that summer to further fieldwork on the proglacial beaches. The summer of 1889 was spent in geological surveys for a new railroad in Georgia and Alabama, and in 1890 Spencer gave up his position as Professor to become State Geologist of Georgia. This position ended in 1893, because Spencer had mapped mainly Paleozoic rocks in the northwest part of the State, and was intolerant of demands that he yield to political pressures and spend more time on practical matters, including gold deposits. His two seasons of fieldwork (in 1887 and 1888) were the main basis for the numerous papers that he subsequently published that named proglacial lakes (e.g., Iroquois, Algonquin), described their post-glacial deformation, and discussed their origin. Spencer did not accept that the Great Lakes region was ever covered by thick ice sheets: he believed the proglacial lakes formed at sea level, and were not the result of ice-dams.																			0315-0941					DEC	2004	31	4					147	156																WOS:000226538100002
J	Komárková, J				Komárková, J			Cyanobacterial picoplankton and its colonial formations in two eutrophic canyon reservoirs (Czech Republic)	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Autotrophic picoplankton (APP) was studied in a one year cycle in two canyon-type reservoirs in the Czech Republic. APP was present in both reservoirs during the whole year, although in low numbers: In general, picoplankton formed only 0.05-10% of the total biomass (biovolume, fresh mass). The main proportion was formed by Cyanobacteria (CPP), eucaryotic species played a negligible role. Several morphotypes of CPP were distinguished during the year (April 1998-May 1999): Two rod-shaped Synechococcus species, one spherical type (2 mum diam.) dividing in one plane (Cyanobium), and another spherical type (0.7 pm diam.) dividing in two planes (Synechocystis). During the summer, a proportion of the CPP formed small groups at the beginning, while later the same cell shapes occurred in groups inside of mucilage that corresponded to colonial genera Aphanothece, Cyanodictyon and Aphanocapsa, respectively. Such a life cycle occurred in all the morphotypes except for one (Synechococcus cf. capitatus BAILY-WATTs et KOMAREK). Its appearance and spring maximum in the Slapy reservoir in 1998 was the only evident difference between both reservoirs as far as diversity of CPP morphotypes is concerned. In the year studied, unicellular picoplankton was about two times more abundant in the Slapy reservoir, while the abundance of total picoplankton (unicellular and in colonies) was almost the same in both reservoirs, i.e. about 0.4 million cells maximum and 70-80 10(3) cells/ml average. The fresh mass of the total picoplankton (unicellular + colonial) was larger in the Rimov reservoir.

Fluvial suspended sediment transfer and lacustrine sedimentation of recent flood turbidites in proglacial Eklutna Lake, western Chugach Mountains, Alaska	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Suspended sediment delivery and deposition in proglacial lakes is generally sensitive to a wide range of hydrometeorologic and geomorphic controls. High discharge conditions are of particular importance in many glaciolacustrine records, with individual floods potentially recorded as distinctive turbidites. We used an extensive network of surface sediment cores and hydroclimatic monitoring data to analyse recent flood turbidites and associated sediment transfer controls over instrumental periods at Eklutna Lake, western Chugach Mountains, Alaska. Close to a decade of fluvial data from primary catchment tributaries show a dominating influence of discharge on sediment delivery, with various interconnections with other related hydroclimatic controls. Multivariate fluvial models highlight and help quantify some complexities in sediment transfer, including intra-annual variations, meteorological controls, and the influence of subcatchment glacierization. Sediments deposited in Eklutna Lake during the last half century are discontinuously varved and contain multiple distinctive turbidites. Over a 30-year period of stratigraphic calibration, we correlate the four thickest flood turbidites (1989, 1995, 2006, and 2012) to specific regional storms. The studied turbidites correlate with late-summer and early-autumn rainstorms with a magnitude of relatively instantaneous sedimentation 3-15 times greater than annual background accumulation. Our network of sediment core data captured the broad extent and sediment variability among the study turbidites and background sediment yield. Within-lake spatial modelling of deposition quantifies variable rates of downlake thinning and sediment focusing effects, and highlights especially large differences between the thickest flood turbidites and background sedimentation. This we primarily relate to strongly contrasting dispersion processes controlled by inflow current strength and turbidity. Sediment delivery is of interest for this catchment because of reservoir and water supply operations. Furthermore, although smaller floods may not be consistently represented, the lake likely contains a valuable proxy record of regional flooding proximal to major population centers of south-central Alaska including Anchorage.					; McKay, Nicholas/JYQ-5440-2024; Praet, Nore/AAQ-7709-2021; Kaufman, Darrell/A-2471-2008	Praet, Nore/0000-0002-5567-3718; Geck, Jason/0000-0002-8479-1588; Loso, Michael/0000-0001-8414-2310; Kaufman, Darrell/0000-0002-7572-1414; OSTMAN, JOHNSE/0000-0001-8060-7635													0885-6087	1099-1085				OCT	2021	35	10							e14375	10.1002/hyp.14375	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14375													WOS:000711813100006

The hydrochemistry of groundwater from wells in the area was then evaluated to determine its suitability for irrigation and domestic uses. The assessment of the irrigation quality of groundwater from this area was based on salinity (EC) and sodium adsorption ratios (SAR), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), and permeability indices (PI). The simulation model reveals that groundwater in the Afram Plains area generally flows from the midsections in the neighborhood of Tease and surrounding areas, where significant recharge takes place, to the outer regions and discharges into the Volta Lake in the southern and eastern sections of the area. Flow magnitude and piezometric maps suggest that there is probably of less potential for groundwater extraction for sustainable irrigation in the central regions of the area, when compared to the other discharge areas. This study reveals that more than 70% of the samples analyzed fall within the C2-S1 category, referring to the medium level salinity and low sodium. Medium salinity waters may be used for irrigation on coarse textured soils with good permeability. About 15% of the data fall within the C3-S2 category, referring to water of high salinity and medium sodicity. High salinity, medium sodicity irrigation water cannot be used on fine-grained soils where drainage is restricted. This is because restricted flow is likely to result in the accumulation of salts in the root zones of crops, leading to salinity and soil clogging crisis. About 3% falls within the C3-S3 (high salinity, high sodicity) category. This category requires special soil management including improved drainage, heavy leaching and the use of chemical amendments on the water. Only one point plots within the extreme salinity-sodicity range. Concentrations of fluoride, arsenic and other natural elements in the area generally fall well within the world health standards for domestic water.

Seasonal phenology and starch allocation patterns in populations of Oxycaryum cubense f. cubense and paraguayense in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Florida	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												Phenological studies for Cuban bulrush [Oxycaryum cubense (Poepp. & Kunth) Lye] have been limited to the monocephalous form in Lake Columbus (Mississippi). Accordingly, there is little available information on potential phenological differences among O. cubense forms (monocephalous vs. polycephalous) and populations in other geographic locations in the United States. Therefore, seasonal patterns of biomass and starch allocation in O. cubense were quantified from two populations in Lake Columbus on the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway in Mississippi (monocephalous), two populations from Lake Martin in Louisiana (polycephalous), and two populations from Orange Lake in Florida (polycephalous). Monthly samples of O. cubense inflorescence, emergent, and submersed tissue were harvested from two plots per state from October 2021 to September 2022. During monthly data collection, air temperature and photoperiod were recorded. Starch allocation patterns were similar among all sites, with starch storage being less than 1.5% dry weight for all plant tissues. Biomass was greatest in Lake Columbus (monocephalous; 600.7 g dry weight [DW] m(-2)) followed by Lake Martin (polycephalous; 392.3 g DW m(-2)) and Orange Lake (polycephalous; 233.85 g DW m(-2)). Peak inflorescence biomass occurred in the winter for the Lake Martin and Orange Lake populations and in the summer for the Lake Columbus population. Inflorescence biomass in Lake Columbus had a positive relationship (r(2) = 0.53) with warmer air temperatures. Emergent and submersed biomass generally had negative relationships with both photoperiod and temperature (r(2) = 0.02 to 0.77) in all sites. Peak biomass was also negatively related to temperature and photoperiod. Results from this study indicate that there are differences in biomass allocation between the two growth forms of O. cubense and that growth can occur at temperatures below freezing. Low temperature tolerance may allow this species to expand its range farther north than previously suspected.

Karst rocks separate both lakes. The elevation of Prespa Lake is about 150 m higher than that of Ohrid Lake. Considering these facts, Cvijic formulated in 1906 the hypothesis that Prespa Lake recharges the St. Naum and Tushemisht springs at Ohrid lakeside. Environmental isotopes demonstrated that Prespa Lake recharges about 37-42 and 52-54% of water emerging in St. Naum, and Tushemisht springs, respectively. An artificial tracer experiment carried out in 2002 physically demonstrated the underground connection between both lakes. This experiment confirmed the supposed underground connection and brought important information about the groundwater velocity, transit time, and karst water conduits development.					; Gourcy, Laurence/AAJ-6717-2020	Gourcy, Laurence/0000-0003-3897-4479; 													0943-0105					JAN	2007	51	5					749	753		10.1007/s00254-006-0388-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-006-0388-9													WOS:000243033300014
J	Brady, K; Brugam, RB				Brady, K; Brugam, RB			Phosphorus and silica recycling in Cougar Lake, a small Illinois reservoir	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Temperature, oxygen, total phosphorus (TP) and dissolved silica (SiO2) were measured from February 1998 to March 1999 in samples from meter depth intervals at the deepest part (11 m) of Cougar Lake, a eutrophic reservoir in southwestern Illinois, to determine if recycling from the sediment is important in controlling photic zone Si:P ratios. An anoxic layer developed between depths of 5m and 12m in summer. Total phosphorus values ranged from 22 mug/L to 1877 mug/L and dissolved silica ranged between 0.02 mg/L and 2.10 mg/L. The highest concentrations of both nutrients were measured in the deep, anoxic water during summer. Although TP levels in the hypolimnion were high in summer, these high concentrations never reached the photic zone. In contrast, high hypolimnetic concentrations of dissolved silica "leaked" into the epilimnion. These results suggest that phosphorus was quickly precipitated from the water column but that silica remained in solution longer. Differences in silica and phosphorus recycling may cause variations in Si:P ratios throughout the year ultimately controlling whether diatoms will be dominant.

J	Talling, JF				Talling, JF			Interrelation of diel and seasonal change, involving summer thermal stratification, weather variables and a mobile dinoflagellate in a productive English lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												A 2-year study was made, using continuous recording, of changes in thermal structure in the upper layer of an English lake during summer strati. cation. Diel, seasonal and irregular episodic events are related to weather variables. Marked diel change of temperature, with short-term strati. cation, is associated with high daily input of solar radiation and low daily wind-run. There is further correlation, probably mostly secondary, with high daily maximum air temperature. The diel cycles may be largely repetitive in appropriate weather episodes, or show progressive modi. cation that can, by vertical heat transfer, extend the more persistent seasonal metalimnion and thermocline. Occasional inverse strati. cation can occur, especially around dawn, with an indication of subsequent penetrative convection. Examples are given in which regular diel patterns of thermal strati. cation are modified by increased wind stress, including the development of temperature oscillations. Such modi. cation can disperse higher depth-maxima of the dinoflagellate Ceratium, that are capable of later re-formation. Metalimnetic maxima of Ceratium are more persistent.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG	2004	524	1					215	227		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000036136.47804.cf	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000036136.47804.cf													WOS:000222941600015
J	Zadereev, YS; Tolomeyev, AP				Zadereev, Yegor S.; Tolomeyev, Alexander P.			The vertical distribution of zooplankton in brackish meromictic lake with deep-water chlorophyll maximum	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We examined the dynamics of the vertical stratification of physical, chemical and biological factors in a brackish meromictic lake with a deep-water chlorophyll maximum (Shira Lake, Russia, Khakasia) during the growing season and estimated how the vertical distribution of these factors influences the vertical distribution of the zooplankton community. The vertical distribution of zooplankton was restricted by the anoxic hypolimnion. Nauplii and younger copepodides (C1-C3) of the copepod, Arctodiaptomus salinus, and the rotifer, Brachionus plicatilis, were found in the upper warm waters. During summer stratification the maximum of A. salinus biomass, which consisted mainly of older copepodides (C4-C5) and females, was associated with the deep-water maximum of biomass of green algae, which are the preferred diet for this species. The vertical distribution of the rotifer Hexarthra oxiuris was bimodal with numerical peaks in the epi- and hypolimnion. Reproduction peaks of dominant species were separated in time. The reproduction peak of A. salinus was at the beginning of summer when A. salinus constituted up to 99% of total zooplankton biomass. The development of rotifers was detected after the reproduction peak of A. salinus when the biomass of rotifers reached 50% of total zooplankton biomass.

Land use change and coastal water darkening drive synchronous dynamics in phytoplankton and fish phenology on centennial timescales	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												At high latitudes, the suitable window for timing reproductive events is particularly narrow, promoting tight synchrony between trophic levels. Climate change may disrupt this synchrony due to diverging responses to temperature between, for example, the early life stages of higher trophic levels and their food resources. Evidence for this is equivocal, and the role of compensatory mechanisms is poorly understood. Here, we show how a combination of ocean warming and coastal water darkening drive long-term changes in phytoplankton spring bloom timing in Lofoten Norway, and how spawning time of Northeast Arctic cod responds in synchrony. Spring bloom timing was derived from hydrographical observations dating back to 1936, while cod spawning time was estimated from weekly fisheries catch and roe landing data since 1877. Our results suggest that land use change and freshwater run-off causing coastal water darkening has gradually delayed the spring bloom up to the late 1980s after which ocean warming has caused it to advance. The cod appear to track phytoplankton dynamics by timing gonadal development and spawning to maximize overlap between offspring hatch date and predicted resource availability. This finding emphasises the importance of land-ocean coupling for coastal ecosystem functioning, and the potential for fish to adapt through phenotypic plasticity. In temperate and Arctic areas, land-use change together with a warmer and wetter climate promote plant and forest growth making freshwaters browner as more degraded plant-litter end up as coloured dissolved organic matter. Although freshwater drain to the coast, the downstream consequences in coastal marine ecosystems are poorly understood. Here, we propose that a century of afforestation in Northern Europe has caused more than a month delay in spawning time for the Northeast Atlantic cod. The two are connected through a cascade of physical and biological processes, starting with plant growth on land moving through browner lakes and rivers causing decreased light penetration in coastal waters that postpone the phytoplankton spring bloom and culminate in an adaptive adjustment of spawning time for the cod.image					Hessen, Dag/AFI-5448-2022; Lindemann, Christian/C-6609-2018; Aksnes, Dag/A-9093-2011; Fiksen, Oyvind/F-1771-2011; Fiksen, Øyvind/M-4402-2019	Lindemann, Christian/0000-0003-3684-2480; Opdal, Anders Frugard/0000-0002-7246-6622; Fiksen, Oyvind/0000-0002-9687-5842; 													1354-1013	1365-2486				MAY	2024	30	5							e17308	10.1111/gcb.17308	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.17308								38721885					WOS:001216226600001

However, our knowledge of spatiotemporal patterns of ISM strength is limited due to the lack of high-resolution, continental paleohydrological records. Here, we reconstruct centennial-scale hydrological variability during the Holocene associated to changes in the intensity of the ISM based on a record of lipid biomarker abundances and compound-specific stable isotopic composition of a 10 m long sediment core from saline alkaline Lonar Lake, situated in the core 'monsoon zone' of central India. We identified three main periods of distinct hydrology during the Holocene in central India. The period between 10.1 and 6 cal ka BP was likely the wettest during the Holocene. Lower average chain length (ACL) index values (29.4-28.6) and negative delta C-13(wax) values (-34.8 parts per thousand to -27.8 parts per thousand) of leaf wax n-alkanes indicate the dominance of woody C-3 vegetation in the catchment, and negative delta D-wax values (concentration weighted average) (-171 parts per thousand to -147 parts per thousand) suggest a wet period due to an intensified monsoon. After 6 cal ka BP, a gradual shift to less negative delta C-13(wax) values (particularly for the grass derived n-C-31) and appearance of the triterpene lipid tetrahymanol, generally considered as a marker for salinity and water column stratification, mark the onset of drier conditions. At 5.1 cal ka BP an increasing flux of leaf wax n-alkanes along with the highest flux of tetrahymanol indicate a major lowering of the lake level. Between 4.8 and 4 cal ka BP, we find evidence for a transition to arid conditions, indicated by high and strongly variable tetrahymanol flux. In addition, a pronounced shift to less negative delta C-13(wax) values, in particular for n-C-31 (-25.2 parts per thousand to -22.8 parts per thousand), during this period indicates a change of dominant vegetation to C-4 grasses. In agreement with other proxy data, such as deposition of evaporite minerals, we interpret this period to reflect the driest conditions in the region during the last 10.1 ka. This transition led to protracted late Holocene arid conditions after 4 ka with the presence of a permanent saline lake, supported by the sustained presence of tetrahymanol and more positive average delta D-wax values (-122 parts per thousand to -141 parts per thousand). A late Holocene peak of cyanobacterial biomarker input at 1.3 cal ka BP might represent an event of lake eutrophication, possibly due to human impact and the onset of cattle/livestock farming in the catchment. A unique feature of our record is the presence of a distinct transitional period between 4.8 and 4 cal ka BP, which was characterized by some of the most negative delta D-wax values during the Holocene (up to -180 parts per thousand), when all other proxy data indicate the driest conditions during the Holocene. These negative delta D-wax values can as such most reasonably be explained by a shift in moisture source area and/or pathways or rainfall seasonality during this transitional period. We hypothesize that orbital induced weakening of the summer solar insolation and associated reorganization of the general atmospheric circulation, as a possible southward displacement of the tropical rainbelt, led to an unstable hydroclimate in central India between 4.8 and 4 ka.

A Composite Analysis of Snowfall Modes from Four Winter Seasons in Marquette, Michigan	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Presented are four winter seasons of data from an enhanced precipitation instrument suite based at the National Weather Service (NWS) Office in Marquette (MQT), Michigan (250-500 cm of annual snow accumulation). In 2014 the site was augmented with a Micro Rain Radar (MRR) and a Precipitation Imaging Package (PIP). MRR observations are utilized to partition large-scale synoptically driven (deep) and surface-forced (shallow) snow events. Coincident PIP and NWS MQT meteorological surface observations illustrate different characteristics with respect to snow event category. Shallow snow events are often extremely shallow, with MRR-indicated precipitation heights of less than 1500 m above ground level. Large vertical reflectivity gradients indicate efficient particle growth, and increased boundary layer turbulence inferred from observations of spectral width implies increased aggregation in shallow snow events. Shallow snow events occur 2 times as often as deep events; however, both categories contribute approximately equally to estimated annual accumulation. PIP measurements reveal distinct regime-dependent snow microphysical differences, with shallow snow events having broader particle size distributions and comparatively fewer small particles and deep snow events having narrower particle size distributions and comparatively more small particles. In addition, coincident surface meteorological measurements indicate that most shallow snow events are associated with surface winds originating from the northwest (over Lake Superior), cold temperatures, and relatively high surface pressures, which are characteristics that are consistent with cold-air outbreaks. Deep snow events have meteorologically distinct conditions that are accordant with midlatitude cyclones and frontal structures, with mostly southwest surface winds, warmer temperatures approaching freezing, and lower surface pressures.					; bliven, francis/E-1450-2012; Wolff, David/H-5502-2012; Kulie, Mark/C-3289-2011; Pettersen, Claire/H-2687-2018	Wagner, Timothy/0000-0002-3958-212X; Wood, Norman/0000-0001-8228-3910; Pettersen, Claire/0000-0002-8685-6242													1558-8424	1558-8432				JAN	2020	59	1					103	124		10.1175/JAMC-D-19-0099.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-19-0099.1													WOS:000506391900001

Bernhart			Hominin use of springs and wetlands: Paleoclimate and archaeological records from Olduvai Gorge (∼1.79-1.74 Ma)	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												An interdisciplinary study of the geologic and archaeological records of a 50 ky year period at the Plio-Pleistocene boundary in Olduvai Basin (Tanzania) revealed that a small groundwater-fed wetland was a consistent focus of hominin activity during periods of climate change (wet/dry cycles). Paleoenvironmental analysis of sedimentary records from 33 excavations in Lowermost Bed II (LMB II), Olduvai Gorge (3 degrees S) revealed evidence of significant climate fluctuations that produced two and one half lake cycles between similar to 1.79 and 1.74 Ma. The region experienced wet-dry cycles in response to combined astronomical forcing effects of eccentricity (similar to 100 ky cycle) and precession of the equinox (19 and 23 ky cycles). Rhythmic variability of the monsoon system produced wet periods followed by a transition into dry periods followed by a transition back into wet climate. A high-resolution study of the stratigraphy documented a groundwater-fed wetland complex (similar to 1 km(2)) that flourished during low lake levels (dry periods) and was drowned during high lake levels (wet periods). Stratigraphic analysis (temporal changes) of 916 artifacts from 13 excavations selected from a landscape transect across alluvial fan, spring/wetland and lake margin environments showed no notable differences in artifact type frequency and raw material type when comparing wet periods (as a group) and dry periods (as a group). However, a lateral shift of hominin activity on the landscape did occur between wet and dry periods. The Oldowan tool kit did not vary at spring sites between wet and dry periods, whereas the tool kit did vary at other lake margin sites between wet and dry periods. Both analyses suggest that climate affected the location of an activity, not type of activity. These data suggest that Oldowan hominins adapted their land-use patterns to exploit spring/wetland resources available during dry periods. A switch from wet to dry conditions likely altered surface and groundwater systems affecting food and potable water availability, forcing hominins to adjust their subsistence patterns.

However, these environments confront an array of stressors stemming from both anthropogenic activities and climate-induced changes. Within the Southwestern Mediterranean Sea, Ichkeul Lake, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and its interlinked Bizerte Lagoon typify the challenges confronting such habitats. This study presents an up-to-date assessment of the planktonic community (phytoplankton and zooplankton) in terms of taxonomic diversity, distribution, abundance, and functional characteristics across these ecosystems. The comprehensive analysis of surveyed parameters, encompassing both biotic and abiotic factors, reveals discernible trends: a declining gradient in nutrients, turbidity, and zooplankton abundance, juxtaposed with an ascending pattern in oxygen levels, salinity, and taxa richness as one transitions from Ichkeul Lake to Bizerte Lagoon. Notably, a shift in functional traits within the phytoplankton community is evident, denoting a transition from a prevalence of mixotrophy to autotrophy from Ichkeul Lake to Bizerte Lagoon. The environmental variables, particularly nutrients, turbidity, oxygen, and salinity, observed during the winter and spring of 2016, align with phytoplankton assemblages dominated by marine mixotroph dinoflagellates and marine zooplankton. These findings signify a profound ecosystem shift in Ichkeul Lake, transitioning from a predominantly freshwater system to an estuarine regime. These observations underscore the pressing need for refined management strategies targeting Ichkeul Lake, emphasizing prudent water resource utilization and regulated discharge, especially in the context of climate fluctuations, to facilitate the restoration of the ecosystem's good status.

Distribution and Diversity of Zooplankton with the Environmental Factors in some Lentic Water bodies from Bihar, INDIA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY & DEVELOPMENT												Freshwater ecosystems harbour zooplankton that fills as a significant part of the food chain of water bodies. Tragically, these ecosystems and diversity therein are compromised by a lot environmental pressure and pollution. An investigation was led from January 2018 to December 2019 to examine variation in zooplankton with the physicochemical profiles of Katira pond and Surya Mandir pond, Arrah keeping standard methods. Observations showed that during summer season water temperature, total alkalinity, hardness and chloride were observed more during summer season followed by the rainy , post-rainy and rainy season but a reverse pattern was observed for pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrate and sulfate. The water temperature demonstrated a positive relationship with total alkalinity, hardness and chloride whereas a negative correlation with pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrate and sulfate. 43 genera of zooplankton together with 15 rotifers, 10 protozoa, 9 cladocerans, 6 copepods and 3 ostracods were related to a numerical density from 1 to 538unit/L. The density of zooplankton was more distinguished throughout the colder time followed by summer, pre-rainy and rainy seasons. Zooplankton density showed a positive relationship with pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrate and sulfate however a negative relationship with water temperature, chloride, total alkalinity and hardness.

Two main sedimentary environments are recognized in this oligotrophic lake: (i) a proximal one, which includes the delta of the main tributary (the Golgol River) and is a deep flat basin with a ponded geometry and limited acoustic penetration, and (ii) a distal one that is composed of several sub-basins highlighting a drape geometry and better acoustic penetration. Based on the correlation of seismic data and sediment cores dated by radionuclides and the identification of tephra layers (Rininahue 1907, Cordon Caulle 1921-22 and 1960), we argue that elastic sedimentation results essentially from the development of homopycnal flows at the end of the winter season in this monomictic lake. Whereas distal elastic environments (PU-II coring site) are dominated by biogenic production and appear to have been little affected by the 1960 Chilean earthquake (Mw 9.5) and nearby volcanic eruptions, this may not be the case for more proximal elastic environments (PU-I coring site) which also experience sporadic hyperpycnal flows during major flood events. In May-June 1960, for example, as several earthquake-triggered landslides dammed the course of the Golgol River and ca. 7 x 10(6) m(3) of volcaniclastic sediments fell over the drainage basin of the lake during the earthquake-induced Puyehue-Cordon-Caulle eruption, successive outbursts in the Golgol valley induced a mega-flood in Lake Puyehue. This hyperpycnal flow reworked a mixture of volcaniclastic and regolith-derived sediments from the catchment, as well as lacustrine sediments surrounding the Golgol delta (during the rising limb of the flood). These recently reworked sediments are strikingly enriched in excess Pb-210 activity suggesting that positive anomalies in the activity of this isotope can be used to determine the source area of elastic sediments.

J	Li, J; Wang, B; Wang, DH				Li Jun; Wang Bin; Wang Dong-Hai			The Characteristics of Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCSs) over East Asia in Warm Seasons	ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCE LETTERS												Mesoscale convective system (MCS) cloud clusters, defined using an objective recognition analysis based on hourly geostationary infrared satellite data over East Asia during the warm seasons of 1996-2008 (except 2004), were investigated in this study. The geographical pattern of MCS distribution over East Asia shows several high-frequency centers at low latitudes, including the Indo-China peninsula, the Bay of Bengal, the Andaman Sea, the Brahmaputra river delta, the south China coastal region, and the Philippine Islands. There are several middle-frequency centers in the middle latitudes, e.g., the central-east of the Tibet Plateau, the Plateau of west Sichuan, Mount Wuyi, and the Sayan Mountains in Russia; whereas in Lake Baikal, the Tarim Basin, the Taklimakan Desert, the Sea of Japan, and the Sea of Okhotsk, rare MCS distributions are observed. MCSs are most intensely active in summer, with the highest monthly frequency in July, which is partly associated with the breaking out and prevailing of the summer monsoon in East Asia. An obvious diurnal cycle feature is also found in MCS activities, which shows that MCSs are triggered in the afternoon, mature in the evening, and dissipate at night. MCS patterns over East Asia can be characterized as small, short-lived, or elongated, which move slowly and usually lead to heavy rains or floods.

Long-term patterns of fish community structure and decline in native species in a Colorado River reservoir, Arizona and Nevada	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Objective The Colorado River has undergone substantial anthropogenic modifications, and a suite of nonnative species have been introduced since the 1800s; consequently, native fish communities are severely imperiled. We examined temporal patterns in fish community structure in Lake Mohave (i.e., lower Colorado River basin) over 40 years from 1980 to 2020.Methods We examined long-term abundance and richness trends and the trajectory of fish community structure in multivariate space to assess stability and turnover using results from biannual (spring and autumn) trammel-net monitoring over 40 years from 1980 to 2020.Result Nonnative fishes were established prior to sampling, precluding the ability to determine historical fish community structure. Bonytail Gila elegans and Razorback Sucker Xyrauchen texanus were the only two remaining native fishes, and both declined precipitously in abundance through time. However, a repatriation program initiated in 1991 prevented Razorback Sucker from extirpation, while reintroduction efforts for Bonytail have failed. Both wild populations are gone. Total catch per unit effort showed a negative relationship from 1980 to 2020, whereas total species richness showed no relationship. Long-term abundance trends at the species level indicated three nonnative species (i.e., Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum, Yellow Bullhead Ameiurus natalis, and Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu) increased, nine decreased, and three showed no relationship. Fish community composition exhibited low stability and moderate turnover and shifted directionally through time in multivariate space, with the formation of three clusters, possibly indicating alternative states.Conclusion The contemporary fish community shows little resemblance to the endemic ichthyofauna that has historically occupied the Colorado River, and the Razorback Sucker is the only remaining native species due to recovery efforts. Continued adaptive management will be required to preserve the most genetically diverse Razorback Sucker population in the Colorado River system, especially while coexisting with an unstable nonnative fish community.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				NOV	2023	152	6					760	771		10.1002/tafs.10437	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tafs.10437		OCT 2023											WOS:001089498700001

We compare species-area relationships for mixed-species flocks to those for the entire bird community and determine how 'nuclear' species, those important to flock formation or cohesion, which often have functional traits such as intraspecific gregariousness, influence flock species richness. We hypothesized that mixed flocks would only form on large islands where nuclear species are present. On the subset of larger islands, we expected flock species richness to rise with island area, reflecting a larger pool of species.Location: Thirty-one islands of varying area in the reservoir system of Thousand Island Lake, China.Taxon: The resident forest bird community and its subcomponent of flock participants. Similar to elsewhere in southern China, the primary nuclear species was Huet's Fulvetta (Alcippe hueti), which averaged 20 individuals per flock, and led the flocks when present.Methods: Birds were surveyed in the winter of 2017 and the autumn of 2021.Results: The probability for a flock to be present, and the species richness of birds per transect, increased with island area, but the species richness of flocks did not. Flocks with Huet's Fulvetta were only found on islands larger than 30 ha. Flocks on smaller islands formed around secondary nuclear species typical of northern Chinese flocks.Main Conclusion: Gregariousness as a functional trait may make nuclear species more susceptible to disappearing in small fragments, leading to flock collapse. The extreme gregariousness of fulvettas may also act to increase competition in the flocks they lead and limit the flocks' species richness. We encourage further comparisons of the species-area curves of mixed-species flocks and whole bird communities to better understand the influence of flocks on community assembly and species diversity.

Blue infrastructures, such as fishways, have been implemented to restore river connectivity over the last 20 years. However, after construction, issues regarding the functionality and effectiveness of fishways often remain. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness and efficiency of two step-pool fishways with vertical slot openings (i.e., Tana and Prata fishways), in the Toce River, an Alpine River tributary of Lake Maggiore. We carried out this investigation over two years by using combined technologies: PIT tag telemetry and video monitoring, taking into account the fish size and river discharge. Fishways were suitable and utilized by trout (Salmo spp.), barbels (Barbus spp.), chub (Squalius squalus) and dace (Telestes muticellus), but not for bullhead (Cottus gobio). Additionally, we PIT tagged both wild and hatchery-reared trout, to compare the use of the fishways by wild and hatchery fish. The passage efficiency was 65.4 % for the Tana fishway and 60.0 % for the Prata fishway, corresponding to values within the range found in the literature. On the other hand, attraction efficiency was very low. Our observations suggest that finding and entering the fishways was more challenging than completing the passage. Most passages occurred in autumn and spring, in relation to spawning migration and high-flow periods. Slight differences were recorded between the two fishways, with longer transit times for the Tana fishway and better performance for adult wild trout at the Prata fishway. The combination of telemetry and video monitoring provided important information to guide future river defragmentation projects in the area and for similar water basins.

Seasonal variations in the optical characteristics of dissolved organic matter in glacial pond water	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Large amounts of dissolved organic matter (DOM) are stored in mountain glaciers. However, few researches have analysed the optical characteristics of DOM in surface waters fed by mountain glaciers and their seasonal variations. In a pond fed by a glacier we observed simultaneous decreases in the dissolved organic carbon, and increases in both absorbance at 254 nm and specific absorption coefficient (SUVA(254)) during the ice-free season 2015. This behaviour differs from the typical behaviour of lake/pond water in summer, and from the trends observed in a nearby pond not fed by a glacier. The trends of DOM properties, main ions and water stable isotopes at the glacier-fed pond could be attributed to transient modifications of the subglacial hydrological system. Flushing of previously isolated pools of subglacially stored water, containing terrestrial DOM derived from glacially-overridden soil and vegetation, would be driven by intense rainfall events during the melting season. These findings suggest that heavy rainfall events during the melting season have the capability to transiently modify the characteristics of DOM in a glacial pond. These events may be further exacerbated in the future, as summer rainfall events in the Alps are predicted to increase due to global warming. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zhang, R; Jiang, DB; Cheng, ZG				Zhang, Ran; Jiang, Dabang; Cheng, Zhigang			Holocene precipitation changes in northeastern China from CCSM3 transient climate simulations	HOLOCENE												To date, climate records have mainly shown three different trends of Holocene precipitation evolution in northeastern (NE) China, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we use model results from Holocene transient climate simulations conducted by the Community Climate System Model version 3 to investigate the evolution of precipitation in NE China and the associated mechanisms. The model results indicate that precipitation changes within NE China show obvious spatial discrepancies. In particular, the annual precipitation maximum occurs in the early Holocene for the western subregion, while it occurs in the mid-late Holocene for the eastern subregion. These results show two different trends of Holocene precipitation within NE China capturing the large-scale precipitation changes appearing in climate records. These spatial features are closely related to the gradual weakening of the East Asian summer monsoon during the Holocene and are mainly attributed to the combined effects of orbital forcing and the ice sheet. Changes in orbital parameters play a major role in the decreased precipitation in the western subregion, while changes in the ice sheet contribute more to the increased precipitation in the eastern subregion. The observed model-data discrepancy partly relates to the low horizontal resolution employed and the physical processes and parameterizations of the model used.

Three stages of vegetation dynamics and climate change are documented in this record. During 35.23 to 25.15 ka, the latter part of Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3, a forest-steppe landscape developed under wet conditions dominated the surrounding areas. The following period, 25.15-11.13 ka, approximately corresponding to MIS 2, was characterized by the overall drought conditions superimposing climatic oscillations. During 25.15-22.25 ka, the shift to typical steppe highlighted the drought trend. After 22.25 ka, severe drought conditions led to the invasion of desert-steppe. The modest climatic amelioration, occurred from 18.47 to 16.24 ka, was characterized by the relieving drought, indicated by the replacement of typical steppe. The landscape was defined by the desert-steppe under a dry climate after 16.24 ka and briefly interrupted by the recovering of typical steppe at the end of this interval. The Holocene likely commenced at about 11.13 ka, reflected by the gradual establishing of forest-steppe in a relatively humid climate. Regional comparisons suggest a roughly synchronous pattern of climate change and variations in the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM), attributing to the force of the northern hemisphere summer insolation and ice volume. In addition, the millennial-scale EASM variability has coincided with the Heinrich (H) and Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events, and the Younger Dryas (YD), indicating the plausible linkage to the rapid Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) oscillations.

Seasonal and diurnal patterns of littoral microhabitat use by fish in gravel pit lakes, with special reference to supplemented deadwood brush piles	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The habitat quality of the littoral zone is of key importance for almost all lentic fish species. In anthropogenically created gravel pit lakes, the littoral zone is often structurally homogenized with limited fish habitats. We supplemented deadwood brush piles in the littoral zone of eight gravel pit lakes and investigated the diurnal and seasonal use of this and other typical microhabitats by six dominant fish species. Shoreline habitats were sampled using point abundance electrofishing during day and night in all four seasons, and patterns of fish abundance were compared amongst unstructured littoral habitats, emerged macrophytes and brush piles. We caught a total of 14,458 specimens from 15 species in the gravel pit lakes. Complex shoreline structures were used by all fish species that we examined, especially during daytime, whilst the use of unstructured habitats was highest during night. The newly added brush piles constituted suitable microhabitats for selected fish species, perch (Perca fluviatilis), roach (Rutilus rutilus) and pike (Esox lucius), particularly during winter. Supplemented deadwood provides suitable fish habitat in gravel pit lakes and may to some degree compensate for the loss of submerged macrophytes in winter by offering refuge and foraging habitat for selected fish species.

J	Bookhagen, B				Bookhagen, Bodo			Appearance of extreme monsoonal rainfall events and their impact on erosion in the Himalaya	GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK												Monsoonal rainfall in the Himalaya dominates erosion and sediment transport through the fluvial system. In addition to the strong seasonal nature of the Indian summer monsoon, striking interannual variations in monsoonal strength characterize longer records. For example, during any given year, rain may penetrate further into the orogen, even though peak rainfall amounts almost always occur at topographic barriers in regions with high relief, regardless of overall monsoonal strength. Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) product 3B42 rainfall is first used to document the spatial rainfall distribution and then the TRMM time series are used to identify temporal and seasonal rainfall variations. A simple, but robust magnitude-frequency relation for each rainfall pixel is used to show that rainfall greater or equal to the 90th percentile occurs at least twice as often in mountainous terrain as in low-elevation regions. Previous field-based observations and measurements show that this significantly higher number of extreme events leads to higher erosion volumes and greater fluvial-mass transport rates. The spatiotemporal context of these extreme events helps to predict occurrences of high sediment flux and could underpin the strategic development of preventative measures. Improved statistics for extreme events are key to mitigating the filling of hydropower reservoirs and abrasion of hydropower turbines, as well as to sustaining infrastructure and successful agriculture in the downstream section of the Himalaya.

Transportation of live fish from commercial shore seines to pay-fishing lakes causes high immediate and delayed mortality during warm summer months. Freshwater drums transported 6 h had 4% immediate mortality and 94% delayed mortality (over 1-2 wk). Salt (5 g/l NaCl), low hauled-fish densities (60 g fish/l water) and late-summer transport significantly (P < 0.05) reduced delayed mortality. Fish tagged after transportation had a significantly higher delayed mortality than those not tagged. Capture stress in seines was a more important cause of delayed mortality than transportation or stocking in ponds.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1982	111	1					58	62		10.1577/1548-8659(1982)111<58:CACOFD>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1982)111<58:CACOFD>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1982NA21900008
J	Dixit, Y				Dixit, Yama			Regional Character of the "Global Monsoon" PALEOCLIMATE INSIGHTS FROM NORTHWEST INDIAN LACUSTRINE SEDIMENTS	OCEANOGRAPHY												The concept of a "global monsoon" proposes that the annual insolation cycle and global-scale atmospheric circulation drive and synchronize regional monsoons. However, model, proxy, and observational studies reveal differences in the regional variability of the summer monsoon and its direct response to solar forcing and glacial boundary conditions. Here, we focus on paleoenvironmental data derived from paleolake sediments in northwest India. These paleolakes straddle a precipitation gradient from sub-humid to semi-arid to arid plains and contain a wealth of information about summer monsoon variability at regional scale over the past 10,000 years. The paleolake records provide compelling evidence of significant regional differences in the timing of monsoon responses to orbital forcings; only sub-humid to semi-arid lakes resemble monsoon reconstructions from marine sediment and speleothem archives, while the arid region lakes contain regional hydroclimate histories. Extracting regional trends from the global signature of monsoon variability is necessary for understanding the regional impact of future climate warming on the monsoon system and human populations. The paleolakes in northwest India highlight the importance of considering the specific location of archive and signal heterogeneity when interpreting monsoon records. Results indicate that detailed records are required from other monsoon regions to improve knowledge of the imprints of the complex monsoon system at regional scales.

Species distribution models for the eastern blacklegged tick,Ixodes scapularis, and the Lyme disease pathogen,Borrelia burgdorferi, in Ontario, Canada	PLOS ONE												The blacklegged tick,Ixodes scapularis, is established in several regions of Ontario, Canada, and continues to spread into new geographic areas across the province at a rapid rate. This poses a significant public health risk sinceI.scapularistransmits the Lyme disease-causing bacterium,Borrelia burgdorferi, and other pathogens of potential public health concern. The objective of this study was to develop species distribution models forI.scapularisandB.burgdorferito predict and compare the potential distributions of the tick vector and the Lyme disease pathogen as well as the ecological factors most important for species establishment. Ticks were collected via tick dragging at 120 sites across southern, central, and eastern Ontario between 2015 and 2018 and tested for tick-borne pathogens. A maximum entropy (Maxent) approach was used to model the potential distributions ofI.scapularisandB.burgdorferi. Two independent datasets derived from tick dragging at 25 new sites in 2019 and ticks submitted by the public to local health units between 2015 and 2017 were used to validate the predictive accuracy of the models. The model forI.scapularisshowed high suitability for blacklegged ticks in eastern Ontario and some regions along the shorelines of the Great Lakes, and moderate suitability near Algonquin Provincial Park and the Georgian Bay with good predictive accuracy (tick dragging 2019: AUC = 0.898; ticks from public: AUC = 0.727). The model forB.burgdorferishowed a similar predicted distribution but was more constrained to eastern Ontario, particularly between Ottawa and Kingston, and along Lake Ontario, with similarly good predictive accuracy (tick dragging 2019: AUC = 0.958; ticks from public: AUC = 0.863. The ecological variables most important for predicting the distributions ofI.scapularisandB.burgdorferiincluded elevation, distance to deciduous and coniferous forest, proportions of agricultural land, water, and infrastructure, mean summer/spring temperature, and cumulative annual degree days above 0 degrees C. Our study presents a novel application of species distribution modelling forI.scapularisandB.burgdorferiin Ontario, Canada, and provides an up to date projection of their potential distributions for public health knowledge users.					; Talbot, Benoit/K-8225-2019; Kulkarni, Manisha/AGP-4383-2022; KNUDBY, Anders/B-4823-2008; Logan, James/KPH-2717-2024	Slatculescu, Andreea/0000-0001-5234-2211; Logan, James/0000-0002-8167-8387													1932-6203					SEP 11	2020	15	9							e0238126	10.1371/journal.pone.0238126	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238126								32915794					WOS:000571887500029

Characterising benthic diatom community responses to abiotic variability in a tropical Ramsar estuarine lake	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Benthic diatoms are reliable indicators of estuarine ecosystem health. These communities can be used to track water quality changes in estuarine lakes that are unique, yet highly susceptible to anthropogenic perturbations due to their high accumulation potential. This study investigated the abiotic drivers of the benthic diatom community structure in the near-natural Kosi Bay Estuarine Lake, a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance in summer/spring of 2016 and 2022. A total of 159 taxa, belonging to 57 genera were recorded. The composition of benthic diatom assemblages was related to salinity variability, with marine species dominating the tidal lower estuarine reaches and freshwater taxa in the distal and oligohaline lake compartments. Taxa capable of attachment to different substrates that enable resilience to tidal disturbance, such as Amphora, Halamphora, Mastogloia, and Seminavis, were dominant in the tidally influenced lower lake compartments. Higher species diversity (H' > 2) was observed in proximity to the estuarine mouth, with regular sediment disturbance favouring increased diversity. An increased availability of DIP (>= 0.01 mg L-1) and sediment organic content (1.1-3.7%), coupled with low flow velocities, favoured the proliferation (RA > 10%) of Cocconeis spp. in the Phragmites-dominated upper lake compartments. Nutrient tolerant taxa, such as Navicula gregaria, Nitzschia frustulum, and Tabularia tabulata, were present in the estuarine lake. However, further investigations are required to determine whether their presence is due to inherent estuarine variability or a precursor to future anthropogenic change. Studies such as these that provide baseline information are essential to help inform effective management and recovery plans of rare estuarine ecosystem types.					; Lemley, Daniel/J-1328-2019; Adams, Janine/AAA-9865-2021	Adams, Janine/0000-0001-7204-123X; 													0923-4861	1572-9834				JUN	2025	33	3							37	10.1007/s11273-025-10051-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-025-10051-6													WOS:001476744700001
J	Stauch, G				Stauch, Georg			Multi-decadal periods of enhanced aeolian activity on the north-eastern Tibet Plateau during the last 2ka	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The north-eastern Tibetan Plateau is regarded as key area for the understanding of the Holocene paleoclimate in central Asia. During the last decade a special emphasis has been placed on multi-decadal to millennial scale climate fluctuations, especially in the context of the recent climate change. However, most reconstructions are based on lake sediments, tree rings and speleothems whereas only little information from terrestrial archives is included. This study presents multi-decadal scale climate fluctuations based on optical stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages from aeolian sediments from three catchment areas. Six phases of enhanced aeolian accumulation during the last 2000 years, each lasting around 80-200 years were identified. The first three phases (1630-1725 CE, 1450-1530 CE and 1250-1350 CE) occurred during the Little Ice Age; the other three (750-950 CE, 390-540 CE, 50-225 CE) during the so-called dark ages cooling. Aeolian processes were strongly reduced during the medieval climate anomaly. A comparison with other proxy records indicates that the formation of aeolian archives on the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau during the late Holocene is facilitated by cool and dry climate conditions during times of weaker Asian Summer Monsoon and probably enhanced westerlies. The results show that short term climate fluctuations can be reconstructed from non-continuous and heterogeneous terrestrial archives in a semi-arid environment, provided a sufficient number of OSL ages from aeolian sediments is available.

J	Dorrance, AE; McClure, SA; Martin, SKS				Dorrance, AE; McClure, SA; Martin, SKS			Effect of partial resistance on phytophthora stem rot incidence and yield of soybean in Ohio	PLANT DISEASE												Phytophthora root and stem rot of soybean commonly causes losses in both stand and yield in Ohio. Environmental conditions which favor the pathogen typically occur in many areas of the state during late spring and summer. This study examined the performance of 12 soybean cultivars with partial resistance, with or without Rps genes, to different populations of Phytophthora sojae and various levels of disease pressure. The soybean cultivars were evaluated in seven field environments with and without metalaxyl over 4 years. There was a highly significant genotype-environment interaction which was due in part to variable disease pressure. The incidence of Phytophthora stem rot in subplots ranged from 0 to 10 plants in the most susceptible cultivar, Sloan, while significantly less stem rot developed in cultivars with high levels of partial resistance or partial resistance combined with an Rps gene in three of the seven environments. Metalaxyl applied in-furrow had a significant effect on early and final plant populations as well as yield (P < 0.001) in two of the seven environments, and for yield (P = 0.05) in one environment. This indicates that at these two environments, 2001 Lakeview and VanBuren, early season Phytophthora disease was controlled with the in-furrow fungicide treatment. When diverse populations of P. sojae were present, yields from soybean cultivars with high levels of partial resistance were significantly higher than those with low levels of partial resistance. Soybean cultivars with specific resistance genes Rps1k, Rps1k + Rps6, or Rps1k + Rps3a had higher yields than plants with only partial resistance in environments where race determination indicated that the populations of P. sojae present were not capable of causing disease on plants with the Rps1k gene. However, in an environment with very low disease pressure, yields of soybean cultivars with partial resistance were not significantly different from those with single Rps genes or Rps gene combinations. These results demonstrate that genetic traits associated with high levels of partial resistance do not have a negative effect on yield. Soybean cultivars that had the most consistent ranking across environments were those with moderate levels of partial resistance in combination with either Rps1k or Rps3a.																			0191-2917					MAR	2003	87	3					308	312		10.1094/PDIS.2003.87.3.308	http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2003.87.3.308								30812766					WOS:000181188500017

We describe a simple, relatively inexpensive ROV-based sampling system designed to collect water samples from small sublacustrine hydrothermal springs. The system consists of a peristaltic pump connected to a 16 loop flow trapping high pressure valve powered and actuated electrically from the surface. Multiple thermistors serve to detect geothermally warmed regions of the lake bottom and to indicate when heated hydrothermal solutions are being sampled.

J	Dickey, H; Schreuder, M; Schmid, B				Dickey, Hank; Schreuder, Maarten; Schmid, Brian			Quantifying dust emission potential of playa and desert surfaces in the Salton Sea Air Basin, California, United States	AEOLIAN RESEARCH												Evaluating the ability of natural surfaces to generate wind driven dust emissions into the atmosphere is essential to the development and refinement of local to regional and global emissions models and the assessment of environmental hazards posed by windblown dust. Close to 3,900 individual PM10 emission tests were conducted with the Portable-In Situ Wind ERosion Laboratory (PI-SWERL) between fall 2015 and spring 2021 on exposed Salton Sea playa and adjacent desert areas, California, United States. Each test location was also evaluated for surface characteristics and geomorphological unit. On playa surfaces, the crust type, presence of loose, erodible surface sand, soil moisture, and percent crust cover were found to have significant effects (P < 0.001) on PM10 emission potentials. On desert surfaces, PM10 emission potential varied significantly between geomorphic landforms (P < 0.001). In general, PM10 emission potentials tended to be higher for desert landforms and less variable compared to playa surfaces. Highly emissive surfaces were generally dry and had sufficient loose surface sand to initiate and sustain saltation and the associated liberation of dust-sized particles. Surfaces characterized by low dust emissions exhibited moist conditions, stable crusts, or gravel lag deposits. The geometric mean potential emission rates ranged over two orders of magnitude, with a low and high of 4 and 398 mu g m- 2 s- 1 (at an RPM of 3,000 or a u* range of 0.56-0.73 m s-1). Based on differences in surface area and emission potentials, the overall dust emissions in the study domain are dominated by emissions from desert sources.

J	Anderson, DS; Cross, TA				Anderson, DS; Cross, TA			Large-scale cycle architecture in continental strata, Hornelen basin (Devonian), Norway	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												Nine large-scale stratigraphic cycles, each about 100 m thick, along the northern margin of the Hornelen basin, western Norway, record systematic expansions and contractions of alluvial-fan, braidplain, and lake facies tracts, The braidplain facies tract occupies the basin center, from time to time expanding toward the margins, and constitutes the deposits of axial or longitudinal drainage from an eastern source, The alluvial-fan facies tract, which comprises the deposits of high-gradient transverse drainages, occupies a narrow belt close to the fault-bounded basin margin. The lake facies tract is between the alluvial-fan and braidplain facies tracts, Physical correlation of strata shows that the large-scale cycles are symmetric in all facies tracts. The symmetry of the large-scale cycles, in which the base-level rise and fall hemicycles of each cycle are of approximately the same thickness, indicates that sediment accumulated in all environments during the entire base-level cycle. Absence of regional unconformities (sequence boundaries) also indicates approximately continuous sediment accumulation in the basin during base-level cycles. The base-level fall-to-rise turnaround is represented by an interval of strata, rather than by a sequence boundary, at the maximum expansion of the alluvial-fan facies tract. Condensed sections are also absent. They are represented mainly by intervals of lake strata at base-level rise-to-fall turnarounds, Strata in the base-level fall hemicycle (decreasing accommodation) accumulated as the braidplain and alluvial-fan facies tracts expanded from the basin center and the northern basin margin, respectively. Expansions of these two facies tracts filled the basin, while the lake facies tract contracted. Strata in the base-level rise hemicycle accumulated as the alluvial-fan and braidplain facies tracts contracted sourceward, respectively toward the northern and eastern basin margins, during times of increasing accommodation. This sourceward retreat of the alluvial-fan and braidplain facies tracts was coincident with expansion of the lake facies tract. At the rise-to-fall turnarounds, alluvial-fan and braidplain sediments are stored near their respective sources toward the basin margins, and the centers of mass of these facies tracts are at basin-margin positions. During base-level fall time, the centers of mass of the alluvial-fan and braidplain facies tracts migrate basinward, The alluvial-fan and braidplain facies tracts usually expand toward each other simultaneously, and then move away from each other simultaneously. This in-phase relationship is replated by a reciprocal stacking pattern when the two facies tracts abut each other near base-level fall-to-rise turnarounds. When the two facies tracts are in contact, the higher-gradient alluvial-fan facies tract initially blocks expansion of the braidplain, As the alluvial-fan facies tract retreats toward the basin margin and fan-margin gradients are reduced, however, the braidplain expands across former fan margins. In the reciprocal configuration, the two facies tracts move in tandem in the same direction. This reciprocal pattern plus changes in aggradation-to-progradation ratio of the alluvial-fan facies tract suggest that alluvial-fan morphology changes during base-level cycles. Large-scale cycle stacking patterns show significant changes in basin-fill architecture through time, including syndepositional structural changes accompanied by changes in stratal geometries, a change from ephemeral to permanent lakes, permanent increase in alluvial-fan gradients, and permanent reduction of alluvial-fan radii and volume at the northern basin margin, Consideration of these changes and the largely in-phase relationships between facies tracts sourced by two separate sediment supplies suggest that an interplay of climate, self-regulatory, and tectonic factors controlled sedimentary accumulation within the Hornelen basin.																			1073-130X					MAR	2001	71	2	B				255	271		10.1306/080400710255	http://dx.doi.org/10.1306/080400710255													WOS:000167412800004
J	Kudoh, S; Tanabe, Y; Matsuzaki, M; Imura, S				Kudoh, Sakae; Tanabe, Yukiko; Matsuzaki, Masahiro; Imura, Satoshi			In situ photochemical activity of the phytobenthic communities in two Antarctic lakes	POLAR BIOLOGY												Photochemical activity of phytobenthic communities in two freshwater lakes in East Antarctica was estimated using a submersible pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) chlorophyll fluorometer, to answer the following questions: (1) Are the communities under bright summer photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) photosynthetically active? (2) If active, which community shows the most active signals? (3) Where is the most productive part (or depth) in the lake? Our limnological measurements indicated the two lakes were ultra-oligotrophic. Diving observations revealed that the phytobenthos of the lakes was moss-dominated which had different life-forms (moss shoots in shallow depths of both lakes, moss-pillars in the shallow lake, pinnacle moss-microbial complex community in the deeper lake). In addition, various mat-forming microbial communities inhabited the lake beds. In situ measurements of photochemical parameters indicated that shoots of mosses living just below the littoral slope, and the apical part of the moss pillars, had the highest photosynthetic activity in open water summer conditions, but mat-forming microbial communities and the other moss-microbial complex communities, showed rather lower activity. Most of the mat-forming phytobenthos surface also showed positive photosynthetic activity, but there were some cases of negligible signals in the shallow depth. This suggests that the photosynthetic activities of mat-forming communities in the shallow water were suppressed by strong ambient light in summer.																			0722-4060	1432-2056				NOV	2009	32	11					1617	1627		10.1007/s00300-009-0660-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00300-009-0660-z													WOS:000271088200007

During years of long residence time, the hypolimnetic waters remained cold throughout the summer, there were strong vertical thermal and density gradients, and the water quality of the hypolimnion was relatively high. During wet years within the drainage basin, when residence times were much shorter, vertical gradients were much less distinct and the hypolimnion was much warmer, though the reservoir was still strongly stratified. The hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen concentrations were much lower, and the coldwater fish habitat within the reservoir was greatly reduced.																			1434-2944						1998	83				SI		83	91																WOS:000078647300010

WILDLIFE BIOLOGY												Waterbirds in stochastic environments exhibit nomadism in order to cater for the unpredictable availability of water resources. Lesser flamingos Phoeniconaias minor have long been thought to be nomadic waterbirds. In southern Africa, conservation efforts for lesser flamingos are hampered by a lack of knowledge about their movement trajectories. To investigate their movement ecology in southern Africa, we fitted GPS-GSM transmitters to 12 adults and tracked their movements over four years, from March 2016 to February 2020. Net squared displacement (NSD) was used in nonlinear least squares models classifying trajectories as nomadic, migratory, mixed-migratory, home range restricted or dispersal movement types. Data from eight of the 12 birds met the criteria for the NSD analysis. Model success was good; only 8 out of 120 (6.7%) movement type models failed to reach convergence. Goodness of fit statistics from the NSD models supported migratory and mixed migratory movement types (concordance criteria coefficient (CC) = 0.78) for more than half of the annual trajectories investigated (57.2%). Dispersal, home range-restricted and nomadic movements best described 28.6, 9.5 and 4.8% of annual trajectories, respectively, but all resulted in a mean CC of < 0.4 and thus did not fit observed NSD patterns as well as the migratory movement types. We then used nonlinear mixed effects models to account for annual and individual differences in migration parameters. Variation in the timing and duration of all migrations were more important than variation in migration distance, indicating well-established summer and winter 'ranges' and routes between Kamfers Dam (South Africa) and Sua Pan (Botswana). We propose that lesser flamingos in central southern Africa may be partial migrants, not true nomads, as most of their movements followed a regular, repeated pattern between two primary locations.					; Botha, Andre/Y-2304-2019; Pretorius, Mattheuns/AAN-6073-2020	Leeuwner, Lourens/0000-0002-5562-6225; Botha, Andre/0000-0003-1077-1215; Pretorius, Mattheuns/0000-0001-9010-7597; Durgapersad, Kaajial/0000-0001-9008-3652; Tate, Gareth/0000-0002-1816-317X													0909-6396	1903-220X					2020	2020	3							wlb.00728	10.2981/wlb.00728	http://dx.doi.org/10.2981/wlb.00728													WOS:000595600400016

Single air photo surveys were conducted in mid-October at Mono Lake from 1996-2012 and multiple fall surveys were conducted from 20132018, the latter to determine variation in abundance patterns within and across years. In four of the six years with multiple fall surveys, peak abundance occurred in mid-October as expected. However, in 2014 and 2015, Eared Grebe numbers declined dramatically soon after arrival, coinciding with low levels of their primary food, brine shrimp (Artemia monica). Abundance remained low from 2016-2018, and this could have been due to a shift to Great Salt Lake or to a massive mortality event. In 2017 and 2018, Eared Grebes breeding in south-central British Columbia, Canada were marked with Very High Frequency (VHF) radio transmitters and light-level geolocator (GLS) tags. Contrary to 1996, when the majority of VHF-tagged birds were molting/staging on Mono Lake, our 2017-2018 telemetry data indicated that most individuals were on Great Salt Lake. Our study provides insight into the variable abundance patterns at Mono Lake and novel information on Eared Grebe migration patterns.																			1524-4695	1938-5390				MAR	2021	44	1					76	85		10.1675/063.044.0107	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/063.044.0107													WOS:000735256200007

Phylogenetic analysis of spring virema of carp virus reveals distinct subgroups with common origins for recent isolates in North America and the UK	DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS												Genetic relationships between 35 spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) genogroup Ia isolates were determined based on the nucleotide sequences of the phosphoprotein (P) gene and glycoprotein (G) genes. Phylogenetic analysis based on P gene sequences revealed 2 distinct subgroups within SVCV genogroup la, designated SVCV Iai and Iaii, and suggests at least 2 independent introductions of the virus into the USA in 2002. Combined P- and G -sequence data support the emergence of SVCV in Illinois, USA, and in Lake Ontario, Canada, from the initial outbreak in Wisconsin, USA, and demonstrate a close genetic link to viruses isolated during routine import checks on fish brought into the UK from Asia. The data also showed a genetic link between SVCV isolations made in Missouri and Washington, USA, in 2004 and the earlier isolation made in North Carolina, USA, in 2002. However, based on the close relationship to a 2004 UK isolate, the data suggest than the Washington isolate represents a third introduction into the US from a common source, rather than a reemergence from the 2002 isolate. There was strong phylogenetic support for an Asian origin for 9 of 16 UK viruses isolated either from imported fish, or shown to have been in direct contact with fish imported from Asia. In one case, there was 100% nucleotide identity in the G-gene with a virus isolated in China.					; Levine, Jay/N-2753-2014; Joiner, Claire/Q-5042-2019	Lewbart, Gregory/0000-0003-0716-1387; Fuller, Frederick/0000-0002-6650-4186; Raley, Morgan/0000-0002-0713-033X; Levine, Jay/0000-0002-9276-2437; 													0177-5103	1616-1580				JUL 16	2007	76	3					193	204		10.3354/dao076193	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/dao076193								17803105					WOS:000248749000003

A numerical model was established, and parametric analysis was conducted to examine the effects of towing speed and cable density on the incline angle. The numerical simulations demonstrate that for a conventional three-segment towed array with heavy vibration-isolation cable and density exceeding that of seawater, the towing speed must exceed 4 kn to maintain the acoustic cable's average incline angle below 10 degrees. To validate the proposed LSM, a 100-meter-long towed array with variable densities was fabricated and tested through lake trials. The experimental results align closely with simulations, confirming LSM as a reliable model for predicting towed array position and posture. The study concludes by analyzing the parallel computing capabilities of LSM and its application in Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) problems. The model's precision and parallel computing capabilities make LSM an efficient, reliable tool for analyzing the steady-state behavior of towed systems.																			0890-5487	2191-8945				AUG	2025	39	4					718	727		10.1007/s13344-025-0054-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13344-025-0054-1													WOS:001572420800009

The use of eDNA has the potential to enable non-invasive, cost-effective, time-efficient and high-sensitivity monitoring of fish assemblages. Although the capacity of eDNA metabarcoding to describe fish assemblages is recognised, research efforts are still needed to better assess the spatial and temporal variability of the eDNA signal and to ultimately design an optimal sampling strategy for eDNA monitoring. In this context, we sampled three different lakes (a dam reservoir, a shallow eutrophic lake and a deep oligotrophic lake) every 6 weeks for 1 year. We performed four types of sampling for each lake (integrative sampling of sub-surface water along transects on the left shore, the right shore and above the deepest zone, and point sampling in deeper layers near the lake bottom) to explore the spatial variability of the eDNA signal at the lake scale over a period of 1 year. A metabarcoding approach was applied to analyse the 92 eDNA samples in order to obtain fish species inventories which were compared with traditional fish monitoring methods (standardized gillnet samplings). Several species known to be present in these lakes were only detected by eDNA, confirming the higher sensitivity of this technique in comparison with gillnetting. The eDNA signal varied spatially, with shoreline samples being richer in species than the other samples. Furthermore, deep-water samplings appeared to be non-relevant for regularly mixed lakes, where the eDNA signal was homogeneously distributed. These results also demonstrate a clear temporal variability of the eDNA signal that seems to be related to species phenology, with most of the species detected in spring during the spawning period on shores, but also a peak of detection in winter for salmonid and coregonid species during their reproduction period. These results contribute to our understanding of the spatio-temporal distribution of eDNA in lakes and allow us to provide methodological recommendations regarding where and when to sample eDNA for fish monitoring in lakes.					valentini, alessio/L-3970-2013; Logez, Maxime/LXB-1843-2024	Vautier, Marine/0000-0001-5830-0047; Logez, Maxime/0000-0001-9843-0495; 													1932-6203					AUG 12	2022	17	8								10.1371/journal.pone.0272660	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0272660								35960745					WOS:000944132200029

In this study, the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating method is employed to date samples from highstand lacustrine sediments, palaeoshoreline, fluvial terrace, and the alluvial fan of the Heihai Lake catchment. Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) C-14 dating was also used to date fossil plants from highstand lacustrine sediments. Based on the calculations of linear regression with OSL against radiocarbon ages for same layers of two sections, the quantitative C-14 reservoir ages were estimated to lie between 3 353 and 3 464 yr during the 1.8 to 2.4 ka, which showed temporal variation. The sources of old carbon are the dissolution of carbonate bedrocks distributed along the Kunlun Mountain. The OSL ages of the different members of the hydatogen sedimentary system at Heihai Lake catchment indicate that a stronger hydrologic condition occurred from 3.0 +/- 0.2 to 1.8 +/- 0.2 ka, with a maximum lake level of 9 m higher than present. This humid stage was widely recorded in different sediments on the QTP and Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP), indicating its broad synchronicity across the Asian Summer Monsoon region. The enhanced East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) and the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) resulted in the increase of moisture availability for the Heihai Lake area during this stage.

The associated water setup and set down during a frontal passage, when wind quickly switches from generally south to north, has significant implications for Louisiana's bays, coastlines, larval transport, fishery, and oyster resources. The Atchafalaya River discharges up to 30% of the freshwater from the Mississippi River which results in an almost entirely fresh Atchafalaya Bay in spring. A one-month deployment of two tripods equipped with multiple sensors was made in the central Atchafalaya Bay near the Wax Lake Delta for the study of the impact of cold front passages on saltwater flux into the bay between March 20 and April 19, 2006. It was found that two episodes of saltwater intrusion occurred during the 1-month deployment. These events had rapid and transient increases of salinity of approximately 2 PSU. These saltwater intrusion events occurred after a high water slack and lasted for 0.5 to 2 h, respectively. High tide appears to be a necessary condition for the saltwater intrusion. This "high tide", however, can be a combination of the astronomical tides and wind-induced surge. Strong southerly wind prior to a cold front passage can be an important additional forcing to initiate and/or strengthen saltwater intrusion. It is estimated that roughly 50% of the observed setup is due to local wind stress, 25% due to wave setup, and 25% due to low atmospheric pressure during a cold front passage. The Coriolis-induced setup is found to be negligible in the current study.

These upwellings appear in the centres of local cyclonic macrovortices with compensatory downwelling located on their periphery in coastal areas. The average duration of upwelling events was 5 weeks, with an observed maximum of 16 weeks. The most stable upwellings in Southern Baikal and over the Academician Ridge covered areas of up to 4,400 km(2) (59 % of Southern Baikal's surface) and 1,550 km(2), respectively. Water was ascending in the upwelling zones at velocities of 1 x 10(-4) to 1.2 x 10(-2) cm s(-1). Temperature differences of 1-4 degrees C and 2-13 degrees C were observed between the downwelling and upwelling zones in the epilimnion and metalimnion, respectively. On the surface of the lake, water temperature can drop 4-7 degrees C for water ascending from depths of 10-75 m, but the observed thickness of the layer within which water was ascending reached a depth of 280 m in August-September and 380 m in October; i.e. the ascending water included the entire upper layer (0-300 m). Geostrophic currents reached up to 24-38 cm s(-1) on the boundary between up-and downwelling zones (usually 5-7 km offshore), but did not exceed 6-10 cm s(-1) in the centres of upwelling zones. Comparison with other large lakes of the world is carried. This study is important for understanding the upwelling process that develops in Lake Baikal during summer stratification and can influence the heterogeneity of nutrients and primary production.

Borax Lake, a thermal lake confined within a biomorphic mound, Pueblo Valley, Oregon, USA	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY					Conference on International Limnogeology Congress (ILIC)	JUL 11-14, 2007	Barcelona, SPAIN	Int Assoc Limnogeology				Relations among geothermal system dynamics, evolution of an 8-m thick biomorphic mound, and requirements to protect critical habitat of Gila boraxobius, a fish protected under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, were explored at Borax Lake, a shallow thermal lake in the tectonically active northwestern Basin-and-Range Province. Neutral pH, thermal water at similar to 105 degrees C discharges within a carrot-shaped vent at a depth of 29 m and rapidly mixes within the vent and lake which is mostly <1 m deep. The 14 hectare thermal lake lies at the crest of a biomorphic mound composed of diatoms, silt-size opal-A silica particles, silica encrusted and permineralized vascular plant fragments, sinter fragments, and discontinuous carbon-rich plant and charcoal layers. Siliceous sinter lines the vent, part of the lake bed, and forms a discharge apron that caps the mound and gently dips (<3 degrees) away from the shore. The hydrothermal deposit unconformably overlies lacustrine deposits of Pleistocene Lake Alvord and began to accumulate prior to BC 3775 to 3655, the age of a charcoal layer near the mound crest. Slope degradation occurs primarily from rilling, gullying, and solifluction as the result of seasonal seepage, overland flow and freeze/thaw cycles. Winter seepage on the flanks of the mound ceases as the water table drops (-1.5 m) during the summer dry season. Piping from an upward seepage gradient also degrades slopes. Stability analysis indicates that the mound is stable under current static stress conditions, however, high water table and cohesionless diatomaceous silt with shear wave velocities less than 164 ms(-1) and proximity of seismic sources indicates the mound may be susceptible to liquefaction and slope failure during dynamic earthquake loading. Borax Lake is the unique product of the geothermal system and the biological communities it supports. Portions of the mound may have failed in the past during seismic loading, eroded, and been rebuilt by processes similar to those active today. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J	Larkov, NS				Larkov, Nikolay S.			FROM CAPTAINS TO GENERALS IN 100 DAYS ("THE EASTERN MARCH" OF A.N. PEPELIAEV)	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL												The article explores the military activity of one of the youngest generals of the Russian Civil War Anatoly Pepeliaev in the summer - early autumn of 1918. This topic has not been properly discussed in the historical literature. This research is primarily based on archival documents, many of which are introduced into scientific use for the first time. In the spring of 1918, Captain A.N. Pepeliaev was one of the leaders of the anti-Soviet armed underground in Tomsk. After the successful Bolshevik Uprising, he took the leadership of Tomsk division on June 2, 1918, and a week and a half later he took command of the Central Siberian corps within the Western Siberian (later Siberian) Army. In the second half of June 1918, executing the directive of the Army Commander, Pepeliaev's corps went into an offensive along the Trans-Siberian Railway against the main armed forces of the Bolsheviks that they had in Eastern Siberia. In the Eastern March, Pepeliaev's corps joined forces with parts of the Czechoslovak Legion headed by Colonel R. Gajda. However, it was soldiers and officers of the Central Siberian corps that played the decisive role in the conclusive battles against the Soviet troops near Lake Baikal and in Transbaikalia. A.N. Pepeliaev participated in its reinforcement that was done through an influx of officers and volunteers as well as through mobilization of urban intelligentsia. In spite of the battle loses, the number of military personnel in the corps increased from 2,403 to 5,428. Moreover, 72.6 % of the military personnel in the troops at the forefront of the offensive were officers. During the Eastern March, A.N. Pepeliaev participated in the decision-making on political questions. He had to repair relations with the representatives of the foreign countries - with the consuls general of France and of the USA in Irkutsk. In Transbaikalia, together with R. Gajda, he neutralized the separatist intentions of Hetman G.M. Semenov and General D.L. Khorvat, who eventually agreed to recognize the Provisional Siberian Government. At his meeting with Japanese General Muto, A.N. Pepeliaev expressed strong dissent against further progress of the Japanese troops into Siberia, stating that it would lead to a violation of Russia's sovereignty. At that moment, the political heterogeneity of the White movement was one of the factors that led to denunciations to the War Minister of the Provincial Siberian Government A.N. Grishin-Almazov. These denunciations falsely accused A.N. Pepeliaev of disloyalty to the Siberian Government, of ambitions to create the Party of Military Dictatorship. Nevertheless, in his private letter, the minister confirmed his full trust to Pepeliaev. The Eastern March in which A.N. Pepeliaev led the Central Siberian corps from Tomsk and Novonikolaevsk to Transbaikalia ended in a complete defeat of the Red Guard and the Red Army troops and in a collapse of the Soviet power in Eastern Siberia. To a large extent, it was managed due to skillful generalship, use of knowledge and experience that Pepeliaev had gained on the fronts of the First World War, his heroism and his high authority among soldiers and officers. Due to his successful actions Pepeliaev was made a Colonel on July 2, 1918 by a decree of the Siberian Army; on September 10, 1918 he became a Major General. By that time he had only turned 27.

Comparison of ARISA profiles of bacterial communities over time indicated that BCC was highly variable on a seasonal and annual scale. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis indicated little similarity in BCC from year to year. Nevertheless, annual patterns in bacterioplankton community diversity were observed. Trends in bacterioplankton community diversity were correlated to annual patterns in community succession observed for phytoplankton and zooplankton populations, consistent with the notion that food web interactions affect bacterioplankton community structure in this humic lake. Bacterioplankton communities experience a dramatic drop in richness and abundance each year in early summer, concurrent with an increase in the abundance of both mixotrophic and heterotrophic flagellates. A second drop in richness, but not abundance, is observed each year in late summer, coinciding with an intense bloom of the nonphagotrophic dinoflagellate Peridinium limbatum. A relationship between bacterial community composition, size, and abundance and the population dynamics of Daphnia was also observed. The noted synchrony between these major population and species shifts suggests that linkages across trophic levels play a role in determining the annual time course of events for the microbial and metazoan components of the plankton.

Evaluating Stochastic Parameter Perturbations in Convection-Permitting Ensemble Forecasts of Lake-Effect Snow	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												Lake-effect snowstorms can produce large snowfall accumulations that are challenging to simulate and forecast. One source of forecast uncertainty for these events is the uncertain parameterization of subgrid processes, such as planetary boundary layer and surface layer (PBL/SL) turbulence and cloud and precipitation microphysics (MP), in numerical weather prediction models. One way to quantify this uncertainty is to design ensembles that use stochastic parameter perturbations (SPPs) to vary individual uncertain parameters within physics schemes. This research aims to evaluate and improve the utility of SPP for convection-permitting ensemble forecasts of lake-effect snow, with a focus on PBL/SL and MP parameterizations. We focus on a snowfall event observed during the Ontario Winter Lake-effect Systems (OWLeS) field campaign, which is simulated with 1-km horizontal grid spacing using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model. A suite of 20-member ensemble simulations are run, including ensembles where SPP is applied only to PBL/SL or MP, where SPP is applied to multiple schemes concurrently, where perturbations to initial and boundary conditions (ICs/BCs) are applied instead of SPP, and where SPP and IC/BC perturbations are applied together. SPPs produce substantial spread in simulated precipitation, despite having only modest impacts on the synoptic-scale flow. They accomplish this by modulating lake-atmosphere fluxes, boundary layer characteristics, precipitation growth processes, and hydrometeor terminal fall speeds. The spread and skill of simulated precipitation from an ensemble using SPP alone is comparable to that from ensemble that uses IC/BC perturbations alone. The physical pathways whereby SPPs generate spread are examined and discussed.

Hypolimnetic Hypoxia Increases the Biomass Variability and Compositional Variability of Crustacean Zooplankton Communities	WATER												In freshwater lakes and reservoirs, climate change and eutrophication are increasing the occurrence of low-dissolved oxygen concentrations (hypoxia), which has the potential to alter the variability of zooplankton seasonal dynamics. We sampled zooplankton and physical, chemical and biological variables (e.g., temperature, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll a) in four reservoirs during the summer stratified period for three consecutive years. The hypolimnion (bottom waters) of two reservoirs remained oxic throughout the entire stratified period, whereas the hypolimnion of the other two reservoirs became hypoxic during the stratified period. Biomass variability (measured as the coefficient of the variation of zooplankton biomass) and compositional variability (measured as the community composition of zooplankton) of crustacean zooplankton communities were similar throughout the summer in the oxic reservoirs; however, biomass variability and compositional variability significantly increased after the onset of hypoxia in the two seasonally-hypoxic reservoirs. The increase in biomass variability in the seasonally-hypoxic reservoirs was driven largely by an increase in the variability of copepod biomass, while the increase in compositional variability was driven by increased variability in the dominance (proportion of total crustacean zooplankton biomass) of copepod taxa. Our results suggest that hypoxia may increase the seasonal variability of crustacean zooplankton communities.					; Carey, Cayelan/D-4874-2016; McClure, Ryan/AAN-1371-2020	Doubek, Jonathan/0000-0003-2651-4715; Carey, Cayelan/0000-0001-8835-4476; McClure, Ryan/0000-0001-6370-3852; Lofton, Mary/0000-0003-3270-1330														2073-4441				OCT	2019	11	10							2179	10.3390/w11102179	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11102179													WOS:000495598400223
J	Jiang, YB; Ji, HB				Jiang, Yongbin; Ji, Hongbing			Isotopic indicators of source and fate of particulate organic carbon in a karstic watershed on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												The studied watershed is a Karst-dominated area on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. The local karstic environment might cause the biogeochemical processes involving POC to be different from those in non-karstic regions. Isotopic composition of particulate organic C (POC) and total N (TN) (delta C-13(POC), delta N-15(TN)) and C/N ratios (atomic) were used to identify sources and fates of POC in suspended particulate matter (SPM) and sediments over space and time in the karstic watershed. Distributions of POC in SPM and sediments show great seasonal and spatial variations. The delta C-13(POC) in SPM ranges from -27.4 to -19.0 parts per thousand and -33.4 to -22.3 parts per thousand in summer and winter, respectively. The C/N ratios in SPM in both seasons are lower than 12 and most are around 7. The surface and core sediments have lower delta C-13(POC) but higher C/N ratios than those of SPM. According to source analysis using C/N ratios, delta C-13(POC) and delta N-15(TN), the major source for POC in SPM is phytoplankton, while POC in surface sediments are attributed to land-derived and aquatic sources. Core sediments in the region affected by less anthropogenic impact have a similar POC source to surface sediment. However, in regions with intense deforestation and farming, land-derived sources may be major contributors to POC in core sediments. Calculated contributions from these sources to POC in the riverine-lacustrine system confirm the above observation. The flux and export rate of POC in SPM are 7.85 x 10(8) g a (1) and 492 mg m (2) a (1), respectively. In contrast to some world rivers, POC output from the karstic watershed is mainly from in-stream photosynthesis. Land-derived POC is merely redistributed in river and lake beds and sediments in the karstic riverine-lacustrine system act as an organic C pool. The observed features are likely due to intense anthropogenic impact and particular geomorphology of the karstic environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The spring had the highest taxa richness of the four habitats that were sampled, likely owing to the relative stability of this habitat compared to the others. Most of the taxa were described from northern and alpine locations in Europe and North America and are typical of habitats in the northern Rocky Mountains, with two notable exceptions. Surirella arctica had been reported previously only from locations in the High Arctic of North America, north of 68 degrees N latitude. Gomphonema caperatum has a disjunct distribution in montane regions of the eastern and far western contiguous United States. This may be the first record of this taxon from Alaska.																			1314-2011	1314-2003				DEC 6	2018		113					33	57		10.3897/phytokeys.113.29456	http://dx.doi.org/10.3897/phytokeys.113.29456								30574010					WOS:000452429800001

Abundance and Bloodfeeding Patterns of Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) in an Oak Woodland on the Eastern Slope of the Northern Coast Range of California	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY												The abundance and bloodfeeding patterns of mosquitoes was studied from 2008 to 2010 at an 18 ha. oak woodland in Lake County, CA. Host-seeking females were collected weekly from sunset to sunrise by paired dry-ice-baited CDC style traps, whereas resting females were aspirated from paired walk-in red boxes. Sequences of the COI gene amplified from bloodmeals from engorged resting females were used to identify the bloodmeal hosts. Aedes sierrensis (Ludlow) and Aedes increpitus Dyar complex mosquitoes were univoltine, although the timing of emergence and abundance varied temporally and seemed weather dependent. Abundance of both Anopheles franciscanus McCracken and Anopheles freeborni Aitken peaked in mid to late summer. Females of both genera bloodfed primarily on mule deer and black-tailed jackrabbits, and few fed on either dogs or humans that were consistently present within the woodland. In contrast, multivoltine Culex tarsalis Coquillett and Culex stigmatosoma Dyar were abundant throughout summer, especially from July to September. Both Culex species bloodfed on a wide variety of avian hosts, with most bloodmeals originating from California scrub-jay, wild turkey, oak titmouse, and house finch. Culex tarsalis fed on proportionately more mammals as summer progressed, peaking at 33% in September.

Contrasting controls on phytoplankton dynamics in two large, pre-alpine lakes imply differential responses to climate change	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The effects of climate change on lake ecosystems are often complex. We examined how phytoplankton in two neighbouring, pre-alpine, large oligotrophic lakes with similar catchments and land uses are likely to respond to climate change. We hypothesised that (i) while their climates and landscape filters were relatively similar, differences in in-lake biological, physical and chemical filters would influence the phytoplankton responses to climate and (ii) direct effects of warming on phytoplankton dynamics and productivity would be relatively minor compared to indirect effects, especially those influencing the lakes' mixing regimes. We combined (i) dynamic modelling of the physical forcing of the lakes under climate change, (ii) multi-year field sampling of relevant biological, physical and chemical variables and (iii) bioassay experiments, to test our hypotheses. Water temperatures have warmed over recent decades in one lake, but not in the other. The warming lake showed evidence of incomplete mixing and phytoplankton layering in winter 2009, while the other lake did not. Such changes influenced the phytoplankton phenology, and incomplete winter mixing is common in similar deep, temperate lakes. Inhibited winter mixing and related indirect effects of climate warming appear to be key early drivers of climate change effects on the phytoplankton of deep, temperate lakes.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2016	771	1					131	150		10.1007/s10750-015-2625-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-015-2625-2													WOS:000372798500010
J	Paus, A; Haugland, V				Paus, Aage; Haugland, Vanja			Early- to mid-Holocene forest-line and climate dynamics in southern Scandes mountains inferred from contrasting megafossil and pollen data	HOLOCENE												The result of 344 radiocarbon-dated megafossils is here presented and discussed. This study aims at elucidating early- to mid-Holocene forest-line and climate dynamics in the southern Scandes along a present gradient of decreasing forest-line elevations. Around 9.5 calibrated ka before present (BP), pine suddenly established vertical belts of at least 200m. These represent the highest pine-forests during the Holocene, ca. 210-170m higher than today when corrected for land uplift. By this, summer temperatures at least 1-1.3 degrees C warmer than today are indicated for the early Holocene thermal maximum around 8.5-9.5cal. ka BP. The most pronounced warming occurred in Jotunheimen, the highest mountain range in Scandinavia, because of an amplified Massenerhebung' effect. Megafossils show the establishment of birch-forests above pine-forests already from the early Holocene. Pine-forests started their decline in the early Holocene and became replaced by the less warmth-demanding birch-forests. Pine megafossil results and pollen studies from the same areas show that cooling around 8.5 cal. ka BP caused a significant decrease in pine pollen production whereas pine-forest-lines were more or less unaffected. In the following period of about 2000years, the high-altitudinal pine-forests could hardly be detected in pollen diagrams. This shows how strongly past temperatures influenced on the pollen production of individuals and how this might obscure pollen-based reconstructions of past vegetation. To be able to correct for this error, there is a need for establishing exact present-day relationships between temperature and pollen production of prolific pollen producers.					paus, aage/AAJ-8096-2020														0959-6836	1477-0911				MAR	2017	27	3					361	383		10.1177/0959683616660172	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683616660172													WOS:000395385500005

Lake sediments thus have been widely used to reconstruct the history of environmental changes in the past, anthropogenic, or otherwise, and radiocarbon dating provides chronological control of the samples. However, specific values of radiocarbon in different carbon reservoirs due to the different pathways of radiocarbon from the upper atmosphere to the lake, called the radiocarbon reservoir age, is always difficult to evaluate because of dynamic processes in and around lakes. There are few systematic studies on radiocarbon reservoir ages for lakes owing to the complex radiocarbon transfer processes for lakes. Here, we investigate lake waters of the Fuji Five Lakes with monthly monitoring of the radiocarbon reservoir effects. Radiocarbon from dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) for groundwater and river water is also measured, with resulting concentrations (Delta C-14) at their lowest at Lake Kawaguchi in August 2018 (-122.4 + 3.2 parts per thousand), and at their highest at Lake Motosu in January 2019 (-22.4 + 2.5 parts per thousand), despite a distance of 25 km. However, winter values in both lakes show similar trends of rising Delta C-14 (about 20 parts per thousand). Our lake water DIC Delta C-14 results are compared to previously published records obtained from sediments in Lake Motosu and Lake Kawaguchi. These suggest that total organic carbon and compound-specific radiocarbon found in sediments are heavily influenced by summer blooms of aquatic organisms that fix DIC in water. Thus, future studies to conduct similar analyses at the various lakes would be able to provide further insights into the carbon cycle around inland water, namely understanding the nature of radiocarbon reservoir ages.					; Yokoyama, Yusuke/N-9623-2013; Yamamoto, Shinya/C-5134-2011	Ota, Kosuke/0000-0003-1190-9001; 													2325-1026					SEP 20	2021	9	1							1	10.1525/elementa.2020.00149	http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/elementa.2020.00149													WOS:000711344800001

Autumn snowfall and hydroclimatic variability during the past millennium inferred from the varved sediments of meromictic Lake A, northern Ellesmere Island, Canada	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												We examined the hydroclimatic signal in a record of annual lamina (varve) thickness from High Arctic Lake A, Ellesmere Island (83 degrees 00.00'N, 75 degrees 30.00'W). In this unglacierized catchment, nival melt is the dominant source for meltwater and transport of sediment to the lake, and autumn snowfall is highly influential on varve thickness through the amount of snow available for melt in the following year. For the period during which climatic data are available, varve thickness in Lake A was significantly correlated (r = 0.50, p<0.01) with the cumulative snowfall from August to October (ASO) during the previous year and, to a lesser extent, ASO mean daily temperature (r = 0.39, p<0.01) at Alert, Nunavut (175 km east). The varve thickness record, interpreted as a proxy record of ASO snowfall and, by extension, ASO temperature, indicated above-mean conditions during five periods of the past millennium, including most of the 20th century. These results corresponded well to other available high-resolution proxy climate records from the region, with some discrepancies prior to AD 1500 and during the period AD 1700-1900.

G.; Westover, Karlyn S.; Fritz, Sherilyn C.; Walker, Ian R.; Leng, Melanie J.; Hu, Feng Sheng			Abrupt Holocene climate change and potential response to solar forcing in western Canada	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Several abrupt climate events during the Holocene, including the widely documented oscillation at 8.2 thousand years before present (ka), are attributed to changes in the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation. Additional mechanisms, such as interactions between atmospheric circulation, ice-sheet dynamics, and the influence of solar irradiance, also have been proposed to explain abrupt climatic events, but evidence remains elusive. This study presents evidence from multi-proxy analyses on the Holocene sediments of Eleanor Lake, interior British Columbia. Climatic inferences from our decadal-resolution record of biogenic silica (BSi) abundance are supported by changes in diatom and pollen assemblages from the same core and correlations with existing regional climate records. The BSi record reveals abrupt and persistent climatic shifts at 10.2, 9.3, and 8.5 ka, the latter two of which are coeval with major collapses of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. The record also reveals a short-term cooling at 8.2 ka that is distinct from the 8.5 ka event and similar in magnitude to several other late-Holocene coolings. BSi is correlated with solar-irradiance indices (r = 0.43-0.61), but the correlation is opposite in sign to that expected from direct solar forcing and weakens after 8 ka. Possible mechanisms causing the abrupt and persistent climate changes of the early Holocene include 1) sudden losses of ice and proglacial lake extent, causing a shift in the meridional structure of atmospheric circulation, 2) a possible link between solar minima and El Nino-like conditions that are correlated with warm spring temperature in interior British Columbia, and 3) the influence of solar irradiance variability on the position of the polar jet, possibly via effects on the strength of the glacial anticyclone.

Constraints on seasonal load variations and regional rigidity from continuous GPS measurements in Iceland, 1997-2014	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL												Two types of signals are clearly visible in continuous GPS (cGPS) time-series in Iceland, in particular in the vertical component. The first one is a yearly seasonal cycle, usually sinusoid-like with a minimum in the spring and a maximum in the fall. The second one is a trend of uplift, with higher values the closer the cGPS stations are to the centre of Iceland and ice caps. Here, we study the seasonal cycle signal by deriving its average at 71 GPS sites in Iceland. We estimate the annual and semi-annual components of the cycle in their horizontal and vertical components using a least-squares adjustment. The peak-to-peak amplitude of the cycle of the vertical component at the studied sites ranges from 4 mm near the coastline up to 27 mm at the centre of the Vatnajokull, the largest ice cap in Iceland. The minimum of the seasonal cycle occurs earlier in low lying areas than in the central part of Iceland, consistent with snow load having a large influence on seasonal deformation. Modelling shows that the seasonal cycle is well explained by accounting for elastically induced surface displacements due to snow, atmosphere, reservoir lake and ocean variations. Model displacement fields are derived considering surface loads on a multilayered isotropic spherical Earth. Through forward and inverse modelling, we were able to reproduce a priori information on the average seasonal cycle of known loads (atmosphere, snow in non-glaciated areas and lake reservoir) and get an estimation of other loads (glacier mass balance and ocean). The seasonal glacier mass balance cycle in glaciated areas and snow load in non-glaciated areas are the main contributions to the seasonal deformation. For these loads, induced seasonal vertical displacements range from a few millimetres far from the loads in Iceland, to more than 20 mm at their centres. Lake reservoir load also has to be taken into account on local scale as it can generate up to 20 mm of vertical deformation. Atmosphere load and ocean load are observable and generate vertical displacements in the order of a few millimetres. Inversion results also shows that the Iceland crust is less rigid than the world average. Interannual deviation from the GPS seasonal cycle can occur and are caused by unusual weather conditions over extended period of time.

Downcutting by the Noatak River has exposed thick sediment successions in bluffs up to 86 m high. Two river bluffs, Nk-26 and Nk 29A, contain correlative organic-rich flood-plain deposits that were formed during and after deposition of the Old Crow tephra at about the transition between oxygen isotope stage 6 and oxygen isotope stage 5, at the beginning of the last interglaciation, Both bluffs also contain older interglacial or interstadial flood-plain deposits of uncertain age. Pollen and beetle remains were recovered from the older and younger flood-plain deposits at each bluff, Pollen from the younger flood-plain deposits suggests tundra vegetation with local dominance of sedge. Juniperus abundances were locally high, especially around the time of Old Crow tephra deposition, Mutual climatic range (MCR) estimates from the insect fossil assemblages suggest that mean summer temperatures (T-max) near the time of Old Crow tephra deposition were about 2 degrees C colder than modem; mean winter temperatures were very similar to those of today. A younger sample from the same interglacial deposit yielded a T-max estimate of 2 degrees C warmer than modern, signaling interglacial warming, Pollen from the older interglacial deposit at Nk-29A suggests mesic tundra, with boreal forest more distant than it is today. MCR analysis of a possibly correlative older interglacial deposit at Nk-26 suggests a T-max about 2 degrees C below present.

Dual nitrate isotopes in dry deposition: Utility for partitioning NOx source contributions to landscape nitrogen deposition	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Dry deposition is a major component of total atmospheric nitrogen deposition and thus an important source of bioavailable nitrogen to ecosystems. However, relative to wet deposition, less is known regarding the sources and spatial variability of dry deposition. This is in part due to difficulty in measuring dry deposition and associated deposition velocities. Passive sampling techniques offer potential for improving our understanding of the spatial distribution and sources of gaseous and aerosol N species, referred to here as dry deposition. We report dual nitrate isotopic composition (delta N-15 and delta O-18) in actively collected dry and wet deposition across the high-deposition region of Ohio, New York, and Pennsylvania. We also present results from initial tests to examine the efficacy of using passive nitric acid collectors as a collection medium for isotopic analysis at a site in New York. Isotopic values in actively collected dry deposition, including particulate nitrate and gaseous nitric acid, are compared with those in wet nitrate deposition and surrounding NOx emission sources. delta N-15 values in dry and wet fractions are highest at the westernmost sites and lowest at the easternmost sites, and stationary source NOx emissions (e. g., power plants and incinerators) appear to be the primary control on delta N-15 spatial variability. In contrast, delta O-18 values show a less consistent spatial pattern in dry deposition. Both delta N-15 and delta O-18 show strong seasonality, with higher values in winter than summer. Seasonal variations in stationary source NOx emissions appear to be the most likely explanation for seasonal variations in delta N-15, whereas seasonal variations in air temperature and solar radiation indicate variable chemical oxidation pathways control delta O-18 patterns. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of passive samplers for collecting the nitric acid (HNO3) component of dry deposition suitable for isotopic analysis. We observe slight differences in delta N-15-HNO3 values between simultaneous samples collected actively and passively (0.6%). However, we observe a larger offset in delta O-18 values between actively and passively collected samples; the causes for this offset warrant further investigation. Nonetheless, passive sample collection represents a significant cost savings over active sampling techniques and could allow a more extensive understanding of patterns of dry deposition and associated insights to nitrogen sources across landscapes.					; Boyer, Elizabeth/D-6617-2013; Burns, Douglas/A-7507-2009; Bytnerowicz, Andrzej/A-8017-2013; Elliott, Emily/E-8122-2011	Golden, Heather/0000-0001-5501-9444; Boyer, Elizabeth/0000-0003-4369-4201; Elliott, Emily/0000-0002-9653-1513; Burns, Douglas/0000-0001-6516-2869; 													2169-8953					DEC 11	2009	114								G04020	10.1029/2008JG000889	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2008JG000889													WOS:000272715100001

Todd			Groundwater inputs could be a significant but often overlooked source of phosphorus in lake ecosystems	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Freshwater lakes are severely threatened, due largely to excess inputs of nutrients and other contaminants. Phosphorus (P) is receiving renewed attention due to recent increases in toxic cyanobacteria blooms in lakes worldwide. We investigated groundwater seepage for its role in P loading dynamics at Oneida Lake, New York, USA-one of the most well-studied lakes globally. P loading was measured at representative sites along the 88 km shoreline over three summers by directly measuring groundwater flow using seepage meters and porewater samplers. Groundwater seepage was a continuous and significant source of dissolved P over the summer months, comparable to tributary sources to the lake during that time. This constant input has enriched the concentrations of P in the nearshore surface waters, significantly above levels in the pelagic zone. Pore Total Phosphorus (TP) concentrations and loads reached extremely high values (up to 100 mg/L), with inorganic P representing only similar to 10% of TP per site. Groundwater seepage flows and P loadings were highly variable across space and time, partially explained by adjacent land uses and precipitation. Our research concludes that groundwater seepage is a significant, but overlooked, source of dissolved P and a crucial factor driving summer primary production at Oneida Lake, and likely other temperate lakes.

The Columbia Icefield is the largest, and one of the most important, ice bodies in the Canadian Rockies. Like other ice masses, it stores water as snow and ice during the winter and releases it during warmer summer months, sustaining river flows and the ecosystems that rely on them. However, the Columbia Glacier and Icefield is shrinking. We use Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery to show that the Columbia Glacier has retreated increasingly rapidly in recent years, and suggest that this looks set to continue. Importantly, we identify a previously undocumented process that appears to be playing an important role in the retreat of this glacier. This process involves the 'detachment' of the glacier tongue from its accumulation area in the Columbia Icefield. This process is important because the tongue is cut off from the accumulation area and there is no replenishment of ice that melts in the glacier's ablation area by flow from upglacier. As a consequence, for a given rate of ablation, the ice in the tongue will disappear much faster than it would if the local mass loss by melting/calving was partly offset by mass input by glacier flow. Such a change would alter the relationship between rates of surface melting and rates of glacier frontal retreat. We provide evidence that detachment has already occurred elsewhere on the Columbia Icefield and that it is likely to affect other outlet glaciers in the future. Modelling studies forecast this detachment activity, which ultimately results in a smaller 'perched' icefield without active outlets.

Two 370-Gbq tritium additions were made to 7.09-ha P and N Lake. One was mixed with the unfrozen water at the time of maximum lake-ice thickness (May 1980) and the other was mixed with the lake immediately after freezing (October 1980). Dye experiments were also performed at four lakes to define the spatial and temporal distribution of the inflow and icemelt layers. Results from the tritiated water and dye addition experiments, as well as conductance and temperature profiles, showed that during ice-on, the cold low-density meltwater floated in a thin layer 0-100 cm beneath the ice, extended over the entire subice-surface area, and left the lake without mixing with the heavier subice water. These results imply that (1) lake models incorporating a lake flushing rate term need to be reevaluated to accommodate the lack of melt-water mixing beneath spring ice and (2) more attention should be given to the early spring meltwater chemistry and its distribution within the upper lake strata.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1985	42	11					1789	1798		10.1139/f85-224	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f85-224													WOS:A1985AUV0200013

Exchange of material with terrestrial environments depends on the season and is more or less suspended in winter. Permafrost and water storage in ice and snow control run off and erosion. Damage to vegetation by flooding, fire, animal or human activity can affect the permafrost and result in rapid erosion. Living space and conditions in lotic environments are modified by ice and during break up are very labile. Fish and benthic organisms in streams have behavioural and physiological adaptations which allow them to benefit from the wide range of river and stream environments found in the arctic and to tolerate the range of seasonal conditions. Ecotones are weakly developed in arctic streams and are of minor functional significance. Only farther south does riparian vegetation begin to play a role in regulating stream processes and not until south of the tree line can ecotones be considered important modulators of fluvial environments.																			0018-8158					APR 28	1995	303	1-3					111	124		10.1007/BF00034049	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00034049													WOS:A1995RC89500012

This lake often exhibits a metalimnetic oxygen maximum at 6-10 m during late summer thermal stratification which has been attributed previously to the dense attached beds of Nitella at those depths. By contrast, we show that phytoplankton chlorophyll a and photosynthesis, but not Nitella photosynthesis, correlate closely with the metalimnetic oxygen maximum over four summers. Physical factors are unlikely causes. Specifically at the depths of the metalimnion in Mountain Lake, the biomass of Nitella is about 11x that of the phytoplankton, but the photosynthetic productivity of the phytoplankton is about 25x that of the Nitella.																			0270-5060					SEP	1991	6	3					293	303		10.1080/02705060.1991.9665306	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1991.9665306													WOS:A1991GN00900008

Body weights of adult males and females increased by about 34% (1129 g) and 30% (953 g) from early March at the Platte River to late April at Last Mountain Lake, Saskatchewan [Canada], average fat content increased from about 250-990 g. Rates of weight gain and fat deposition among males and females averaged 25-18 and 16-13 g/day. Body weights and fat content of cranes staging along the North Platte River followed similar patterns and usually were higher than along the Platte River during comparable periods. Fat reserves of paired cranes collected after their arrival at a major breeding ground on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta in western Alaska [USA] averaged about 530 g, or about 46% less than peak fat content in Saskatchewan. Patterns of weight increase and fat deposition in cranes during migration were similar to those previously described for northern-nesting geese, except that nutrient storage is not sex specific in cranes. Body protein of adult female cranes did not change significantly during spring migration (P = 0.28). Female cranes allocate less nutrients to clutch formation in proportion to body size than do northern-nesting geese.																				1938-4254					1985	102	2					362	368		10.2307/4086780	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4086780													WOS:A1985AGU0400014

Between 18 and 571 positions were received from the satellite devices. Extensive excursions were identified by defining the distance to the activity centre and have been removed before home ranges were computed. Home range size varied considerably among the individuals tracked. Minimum convex polygons, with outliers removed, ranged between 2.25 and 19.16 km(2) and 95 % kernel contours (calculated in Ranges 8) varied from 2.37 to 12.04 km(2) in the Mecklenburg Lake District. Occurrence of territorial behaviour as identified by visual observations changed significantly throughout the year with a maximum in May and a minimum in December. An optimal habitat quality characterized by shallow and fish-rich freshwater lakes with undisturbed nesting areas in surrounding forests is a prerequisite for small home ranges and for the high abundance of breeding birds found within the Mecklenburg Lake district. The year-round territoriality is attributed to a sufficient food supply throughout the seasons, either by mild winters allowing access to fish and/or waterfowl on open waters or, in hard winters, to the availability of carcasses and remains of larger animals from hunting activities when frozen lakes restricte access to prey.

Thus, individual D. pseudospathaceum are exposed to the fish immune system only for a short time, suggesting that only innate immunity can be active against the parasite. However, in nature sticklebacks are exposed to D. pseudospathaceum repeatedly since snails are shedding cercariae from late spring to autumn. Therefore, acquired immunity after initial infection would be advantageous against subsequent parasite encounters. Methods: We investigated if sticklebacks originating from a lake with high and from a river with low prevalence of D. pseudospathaceum differ in susceptibility to repeated exposure to the parasite. We compared infection success and immune functions in laboratory-bred sticklebacks from both habitats in nave fish with fish that had been pre-exposed to eye flukes. Head kidney leukocytes (HKL) from experimental sticklebacks were investigated for respiratory burst activity and the proliferation of lymphocytes and monocytes 1.5, 5 and 15 days after infection. Results: Lake sticklebacks were less susceptible than river sticklebacks, however, in both populations pre-exposure led to a similar relative reduction in infection success. The respiratory burst activity was higher with HKL from lake sticklebacks and was up-regulated in pre-exposed fish but dropped 1.5d after an additional exposure, suggesting that activation of phagocytic cells is crucial for the defense against D. pseudospathaceum. Changes in lymphocyte proliferation were only detectable 1.5d after the last exposure in lake sticklebacks, but not 5 and 15d post exposure, indicating that a lymphocyte mediated acquired immune response was not induced. Proliferation of monocytes was significantly increased 1.5d after the last exposure with HKL from both stickleback populations. Conclusions: Increased resistance to D. pseudospathaceum in sticklebacks from both populations upon pre-exposure cannot be explained by a prominent adaptive immune response. Monocytic leukocytes were more responsive, suggesting that rather cells of the innate than the adaptive immune system are active in the defense of D. pseudospathaceum.

Sulfur cycling in a stratified euxinic lake with moderately high sulfate: Constraints from quadruple S isotopes	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												We present a 3-year study of concentrations and sulfur isotope values (Delta S-34, Delta S-33, and Delta S-36) of sulfur compounds in the water column of Fayetteville Green Lake (NY, USA), a stratified (meromictic) euxinic lake with moderately high sulfate concentrations (12-16 mM). We utilize our results along with numerical models (including transport within the lake) to identify and quantify the major biological and abiotic processes contributing to sulfur cycling in the system. The isotope values of sulfide and zero-valent sulfur across the redox-interface (chemocline) change seasonally in response to changes in sulfide oxidation processes. In the fall, sulfide oxidation occurs primarily via abiotic reaction with oxygen, as reflected by an increase in sulfide delta S-34 at the redox interface. Interestingly, S isotope values for zero-valent sulfur sampled at this time still reflect production and recycling by phototrophic S-oxidation. In the spring, sulfide S isotope values suggest an increased input from phototrophic oxidation, consistent with a more pronounced phototroph population at the chemocline. This trend is associated with smaller fractionations between sulfide and zero-valent sulfur, suggesting a metabolic rate control on fractionation similar to that for sulfate reduction. Comparison of our data with previous studies indicates that the S isotope values of sulfate and sulfide in the deep waters are remarkably stable over long periods of time, with consistently large fractionations of up to 58 parts per thousand in delta S-34. Models of the delta S-34 and Delta S-33 trends in the deep waters (considering mass transport via diffusion and advection along with biological processes) require that these fractionations are a consequence of sulfur compound disproportionation at and below the redox interface in addition to large fractionations during sulfate reduction. The large fractionations during sulfate reduction appear to be a consequence of the high sulfate concentrations and the distribution of organic matter in the water column. The occurrence of disproportionation in the lake is supported by profiles of intermediate sulfur compounds and by lake microbiology, but is not evident from the delta S-34 trends alone. These results illustrate the utility of including minor S isotopes in sulfur isotope studies to unravel complex sulfur cycling in natural systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	ROELOFS, JGM				ROELOFS, JGM			INLET OF ALKALINE RIVER WATER INTO PEATY LOWLANDS - EFFECTS ON WATER-QUALITY AND STRATIOTES-ALOIDES L STANDS	AQUATIC BOTANY												As a result of changed land use and concomitantly increased drainage, in combination with increased use of water for industrial, agricultural and other human purposes, there is an increasing shortage of "natural" water in many areas of The Netherlands in summer. To compensate for this shortage, increasing amounts of hard water from the Rivers Rhine and Meuse are diverted to these lowlands. It is commonly assumed that the disappearance of Stratiotes aloides L. in peaty lowlands is caused by a decline of the water quality, owing to high concentrations of nutrients in the incoming water. However, field observations in "de Weerribben", a large mire complex in The Netherlands, indicated that the decline of the water quality in this area is caused by an altered ion composition of the water. The incoming Rhine-type water from Lake IJsselmeer is very alkaline, rich in HCO3- and SO4(2-). These anions appear to be responsible for a change in the decomposition processes. Consequently, the peat becomes very fine and soft, and because of increased bioturbation the water becomes turbid. As a result of increased reduction processes in the soil there is an increased mobility of phosphorus, leading to internal eutrophication and greatly increased levels of reduced compounds such as S2-, CH4 and NH4+ in the soft, upper layer of the bottom. Transplantation experiments with Stratiotes aloides plants showed that the plants started to decay in winter, after migration to the soft, upper sapropel layer. Culture experiments proved that the S2- and NH4+ levels in this layer are lethal to Stratiotes plants.

Biological monitoring of wild thicklip grey mullet (Chelon labrosus), golden grey mullet (Liza aurata), thinlip mullet (Liza ramada) and flathead mullet (Mugil cephalus) (Pisces: Mugilidae) from different Adriatic sites:: meristic counts and skeletal anomalies	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												This paper reports on a part of PRISMA project, funded by the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (M.U.R.S.T.), involving the biomonitoring of fish populations in two different Adriatic Sea sites by using some integrated descriptors at organismic level (skeletal anomalies and meristic count variation). Given the scarcity of up-to-date data on biology, physical and chemical oceanography, and environmental geophysics, as well on the degree of pollution of this Sea, the goal of the project was to contribute at enhancing the knowledge on environmental biology of Adriatic Sea. In particular, this part of the project analyzed different samplings of some mullets species for the presence of skeletal malformations under the hypothesis that stressed environment should induce alteration in skeletal development pattern in fish, as indicated by many authors. So, the investigation on mullets skeletal structures was utilized to monitor two different Adriatic Sea sites, where exhaustive information (chemical analysis of water and sediment, i.e.) on environmental conditions lack. We observed a total of 2169 individuals, 79% of which were fry and the remainder sub-adults, collected during the seasonal migration in freshwater (spring and autumn 1997) by purse-seine. Chelon labrosus accounted for 18% of the samples, Liza aurata 24%, Liza ramada 22% and Mugil cephalus 36%. Fish were sampled in two Adriatic sites, Sacca di Goro (northern Italy, Po River delta) and Lake Lesina (southern Italy). Other samplings from Tyrrhenian Sea (Fiumicino, Tiber river mouth) and from an aquaculture facility (Grosseto) were used in order to obtain additional information on skeletal plasticity of Mugilidae. Observations included meristic counts and skeletal anomalies and some multi-parametric analyses were per-formed on the data set. The results showed significant differences among the type and rate of skeletal anomalies observed in the fish samples: as far as Adriatic samples are concerned, higher malformation charge was observed in the Sacca di Goro individuals than in Lesina ones. Further, L. aurata showed a non-specific skeletal pattern and the lowest frequency of deformed individual (8.6% of total observed individuals), unlike C labrosus, L. ramada and L. aurata. So, these Mugilidae species resulted to be differently affected by skeletal anomalies according to the sampling site. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Monitoring nutrient loads is especially important for the Baltic Sea, which is especially sensitive to the eutrophication. Using optical remote sensing data in mapping total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) is challenging because these substances do not have a direct influence on the water optics that remote sensing sensors can detect. On the other hand, it would be very rewarding. In this study, more than 25,000 Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) data algorithms were tested in order to detect the TN and TP concentrations in the Estonian marine waters between 2016-2021. The TN estimations were well derived for Estonian marine waters (R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 4.87 mu molN L-1, MAPE = 14%, n = 708), while the TP estimations were weaker (R-2 = 0.38, RMSE = 0.23 mu molP L-1, MAPE = 24%, n = 730). The Estonian marine waters were divided into six geographic regions in order to study the effect of regional water quality on the TN and TP retrievals. The nutrient concentrations were derived in every region when spring and summer periods were treated separately. In this study, the detection of both nutrients was more successful in more closed areas with P deficiency, while in open sea areas it was more challenging. This study shows that it is possible to estimate nutrients, especially TN, from remote sensing data. Consequently, remote sensing could provide a reliable support to the conventional monitoring by covering large marine areas with high temporal and spatial resolution data.					; Kutser, Tiit/H-1304-2015; Soomets, Tuuli/F-8747-2016; Jefimova, Jekaterina/Q-5691-2017	Kutser, Tiit/0000-0001-9679-1422; Soomets, Tuuli/0000-0002-3297-6652; Toming, Kaire/0000-0001-5190-2459; 														2072-4292				MAR	2022	14	6							1487	10.3390/rs14061487	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14061487													WOS:000774350700001
J	Zhen, M; Chen, ZL; Zheng, R				Zhen, Meng; Chen, Zilin; Zheng, Rui			Outdoor Wind Comfort and Adaptation in a Cold Region	BUILDINGS												The outdoor wind comfort is important for evaluations of the urban wind environment. The existing wind comfort criteria are based on the correlations between wind parameters, human activity levels, and wind comfort level categories. These criteria vary among different climates and regions, and they are influenced by meteorological parameters and human wind adaptation. In this study, an outdoor wind comfort questionnaire survey was conducted and meteorological measurements were collected in Xi'an, which is located in the cold region of China. The square and lake side were chosen as the test sites. The mean wind sensation vote (MWSV) and wind speed of neutral wind sensation were used as indexes to analyze the correlation between outdoor wind comfort and human wind adaptation. The results showed that the wind sensation level was generally moderate. At -1 < MWSV < 1, the fluctuations in the wind speed had little effect on the wind sensation, but when MWSV > 1 or MWSV < -1, the degree of discomfort increased as the absolute value of MWSV increased. When the wind speed exceeded 1 m/s, the amount of clothing insulation was greatly increased. The metabolic rate fluctuated between 1.5 met and 2 met. Expectations that the wind speed in the winter would be less than 1.05 m/s were greater than expectations that the wind speed would be more than 1.05 m/s in the summer, and people generally adapted to a low wind environment with wind speeds below 1 m/s. The acceptable wind ranges for more than 90% of participants at the square and lake side were (0 m/s, 2.02 m/s) and (0.01 m/s, 2.86 m/s). This study provides support for the revision of outdoor wind comfort standards and a methodological basis for outdoor wind comfort research at the same latitude throughout the world.

Drainage Network Structure and Hydrologic Behavior of Three Lake-Rich Watersheds on the Arctic Coastal Plain, Alaska	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Watersheds draining the Arctic Coastal Plain (ACP) of Alaska are dominated by permafrost and snowmelt runoff that create abundant surface storage in the form of lakes, wetlands, and beaded streams. These surface water elements compose complex drainage networks that affect aquatic ecosystem connectivity and hydrologic behavior. The 4676 km(2) Fish Creek drainage basin is composed of three watersheds that represent a gradient of the ACP landscape with varying extents of eolian, lacustrine, and fluvial landforms. In each watershed, we analyzed 2.5-m-resolution aerial photography, a 5-m digital elevation model, and river gauging and climate records to better understand ACP watershed structure and processes. We show that connected lakes accounted for 19 to 26% of drainage density among watersheds and most all channels initiate from lake basins in the form of beaded streams. Of the >2500 lakes in these watersheds, 33% have perennial streamflow connectivity, and these represent 66% of total lake area extent. Deeper lakes with over-wintering habitat were more abundant in the watershed with eolian sand deposits, while the watershed with marine silt deposits contained a greater extent of beaded streams and shallow thermokarst lakes that provide essential summer feeding habitat. Comparison of flow regimes among watersheds showed that higher lake extent and lower drained lake-basin extent corresponded with lower snowmelt and higher baseflow runoff. Variation in baseflow runoff among watersheds was most pronounced during drought conditions in 2007 with corresponding reduction in snowmelt peak flows the following year. Comparison with other Arctic watersheds indicates that lake area extent corresponds to slower recession of both snowmelt and baseflow runoff. These analyses help refine our understanding of how Arctic watersheds are structured and function hydrologically, emphasizing the important role of lake basins and suggesting how future lake change may impact hydrologic processes.					; Grosse, Guido/F-5018-2011	Jones, Benjamin/0000-0002-1517-4711; Grosse, Guido/0000-0001-5895-2141													1523-0430	1938-4246				NOV	2012	44	4					385	398		10.1657/1938-4246-44.4.385	http://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1938-4246-44.4.385													WOS:000311010700001

We have studied the viability of Giardia muris cysts suspended in lake, river, and tap water, while also monitoring water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and other water quality parameters. Fecal pellets containing G. muris cysts were placed in glass vials covered with filter paper and exposed to (i) lake water at 15 ft (ca. 4.6 m) and 30 ft (ca. 9.2 m), (ii) river water, (iii) tap water, and (iv) distilled water stored under laboratory conditions. At 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 84 days, two vials from each environment were removed, and cyst viability was determined by (i) fluorogenic dye exclusion, (ii) production of giardiasis in an animal, and (iii) cyst morphology by Nomarski microscopy. In the fall, the cysts suspended at 30 ft in lake water remained viable for up to 56 days whereas cysts stored at 15 ft were nonviable after day 28. The G. muris cysts exposed to river water remained viable up to 28 days as determined by the production of giardiasis in mice. G. muris cysts suspended in tap water showed no signs of viability after 14 days, while cysts serving as controls (exposed to refrigerated distilled water) remained viable for up to 56 days. In the winter, Giardia cysts suspended in either lake or river water were viable for 56 to 84 days whereas cysts exposed to tap water were nonviable by day 14. Comparison of water quality parameters with the results of viability determination revealed that only decreased water temperature (<10.degree.C) was consistent with prolonged survival of G. muris in different types of environmental water.

J	Dargahi, B; Setegn, SG				Dargahi, Bijan; Setegn, Shimelis Gebriye			Combined 3D hydrodynamic and watershed modelling of Lake Tana, Ethiopia	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The growing high demand for lake Tana water portends a disturbing future. The main objective of this paper is to make a contribution to the development of a sustainable use of the water of Lake Tana. A fully three-dimensional hydrodynamic model was combined with a watershed model and together, these models were successfully validated for the year 2006. The flow structure is characterized by large recirculation and secondary flow regions. Secondary flows are induced by hydrodynamic instabilities occurring at the interfaces of layers with a velocity gradient and the interaction with the irregularities of the bed. The weak stratification process in Lake Tana is characterized by a classic summer profile, which is more pronounced during January-February. Mixing processes in the lake are controlled by wind, the mixing energy induced by both river inflows and the lake outlet, and convective mixing due to the negative buoyancy. An alarming fall of the water levels in Lake Tana was found in response to the planned water withdrawal. The long flushing time (19 months) will not allow a fast decay of contaminated materials released into the lake. The flow structure will not be significantly modified by the planned water withdrawal but the flushing time will decrease. The hydrodynamics of Lake Tana resemble a closed system similar to a shallow reservoir with an overflow type outlet. The implication is that the lake is vulnerable to changes in external conditions and sustainable use of the water resource of the lake will require awareness of this vulnerability. The combined watershed and hydrodynamic models would be effective tools to achieve this awareness. It is also necessary to address the impact of climate change on the fate of the lake. These are all difficult challenges that need to be addressed to safeguard the sensitive eco-system of the area. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It is an important disease in terms of public health because it can cause epidemics. In this study, we aimed to retrospectively evaluate 11 cases followed up in our clinic with the diagnosis of leptospirosis in terms of epidemiological features, detected agents, clinical and laboratory findings.The patients were diagnosed with microscopic agglutination test (MAT) and/or ElISA IgM methods. Nine (81.8%) of the cases were male, two (18.1%) were female and the average age was determined as 54.18 (26-68) years. Two of the cases applied in the summer and nine in the autumn-winter months. All patients came from rural areas (collecting hazelnuts, owning vineyards and dealing with animal husbandry) and one of our cases had a history of fishing in the lake. All the 11 cases had fatigue, nine (81.8%) had fever, six (54.5%) had nausea-vomiting, three (27.2%) had headache, four (36.3%) had diffuse muscle-joint pain, five (45.4%) had diarrhea, three (27.2%) had jaundice, one (9. 09%) had shortness of breath, three (27.2%) were unable to urinate, two (18.1%) had rash (one was defined as vasculitis and the other as drug eruption), two (18.1%) had abdominal pain and one (9.09%) had bilateral conjunctival redness. At the time of admission to the hospital, one patient had acute respiratory distress syndrome, one patient had vasculitis and one patient had truncal ataxia. As a result of MAT sent for diagnostic purposes: Leptospira interrogans serovar icterohemorrhagiae strain Wijnberg was detected in seven cases, L.interrogans serovar Bratislava strain Jez Bratislava in two cases, L.interrogans serovar Hepdomadis strain Hebdomadis in one case, L.interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain Winjberg in one case. L.interrogans was detected in all cases and the most common serovar was icterohemorrhagiae. The most common symptoms of leptospirosis are fatigue, fever, chills, nausea and vomiting. While these symptoms may mimic many diseases, the presence of conjunctival hyperemia may be helpful in the diagnosis. leptospirosis may present in different clinics due to multisystemic involvement (vasculitis, truncal ataxia, etc.). In laboratory tests, thrombocytopenia is frequently associated and total bilirubin, creatinine, creatinine phosphokinase may be elevated. In our study, procalcitonin was also found to be elevated in most patients. The most common causative agent was L.interrogans serovar icterohemorrhagiae and rodents were thought to be the most common source. The detection of other serovars suggested that farm animals and domestic animals other than rodents may have played a role as possible reservoirs. The causative agents and identifying possible sources is important for the formulation of health policies. Outbreaks can be prevented in disasters such as floods by continuing educational activities on transmission routes and taking environmental health measures. leptospirosis should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis in regions with high rainfall, such as the Black Sea region, due to climatic conditions and Leptospira reservoir potential and further studies should be done to increase awareness.

Recent studies revealed that, although the present lake is of post-Pleistocene origin, its hydrological system is of at least Pliocene origin. The basin of this lake is characterized by rich biodiversity and high endemism, particularly in the local spring areas. Our study upon freshwater shrimps from the family Atyidae conducted in the Skadar Lake as well as adjacent springs and rivers led to the description of a new species Atyaephyra vladoi , on the basis of morphological features and molecular data. Phylogenetic investigation using mitochondrial COI gene sequences revealed that this new species is most closely related to the south-Balkan A. thyamisensis, from which it diverged in Late Miocene. Population of A. vladoi has expanded both in demographic and spatial terms during the last major interglacial period before the Holocene, i.e. Marine Isotope Stage 5 or Eemian. Combining this evidence with occurrence of A. vladoi mainly in the areas under influence of spring and riverine waters, we can conclude that the species is probably a relic of the old marshlands occupying the basin before the present lake. This supports the supposedly ancient, pre-Holocene, origins of Lake Skadar hydrological system. (C) 2018 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

J	Van Asch, N; Hoek, WZ				Van Asch, Nelleke; Hoek, Wim Z.			The impact of summer temperature changes on vegetation development in Ireland during the Weichselian Lateglacial Interstadial	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												We analysed pollen from a sediment core from Fiddaun, a small Lateglacial lake basin in western Ireland. Results reflect the general Lateglacial vegetation development in Ireland, as reconstructed from other pollen records. The Fiddaun diagram shows a number of short-lived regressive vegetation phases during the Interstadial. The close similarity between two pollen records from the same region (Fiddaun and Lurga) indicates that these fluctuations probably reflect regional rather than local changes. Comparison with a previously published climate reconstruction, based on a chironomid-inferred mean July air temperature reconstruction, lithology, and oxygen and carbon isotopes of lake marl from the Fiddaun record, allowed us to establish the relationship between summer temperature and vegetation changes. Results reveal that two temporary regressive shifts in the pollen record correspond to cold oscillations, which have been correlated to Greenland Interstadial 1b and 1d. It seems that the first cold oscillation (GI-1d) had the most distinct effect on vegetation in Ireland. In contrast, it appears that the transition from Juniperus shrubland and Empetrum heath to grassland, which is estimated at similar to 13.7?ka BP, was not caused by decreasing summer temperatures, as no substantial change is observed in the climate proxies.

Previous studies have assessed the spatial and temporal dynamics of the EASM, however vegetation responses to Holocene climate change and their driving mechanisms are yet to be understood. In this study, our multi-proxy records from southeast China are used to better understand Holocene climate change and its effects on vegetation. These records reveal a warm and wet climate from ca. 8.0 to 2.0 ka cal bp, followed by a cooler and drier climate since ca. 2.0 ka cal bp. The extent of evergreen broadleaved forest decreased significantly after 2.0 ka cal bp, which was in response to the cooler and drier climate in this period. During the Mid Holocene, solar radiation was probably the dominant factor controlling climate variability. A higher frequency of the El Nino event and increased CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, along with a rapid southward movement of the inter tropical convergence zone (ITCZ), resulted in the weakening of the EASM since the Late Holocene. An even cooler and drier climate was identified for ca. 7.5-7.2 ka cal bp, and this abrupt cooling event occurred earlier in southeastern than in northern China. There was a reduction in forest cover in response to this rapid climate change. Decreased solar radiation and the influx of meltwater into the North Atlantic were the probable causes of this event.

However, the hydrology of these high-altitude debris accumulations is poorly known. Understanding the origin and quality of rock glacier outflows is essential to evaluate their contribution and impact on headwater systems. In this study, we developed a conceptual model explaining the main hydro-chemical processes in active rock glaciers in the current context of permafrost warming. This conceptual model was derived from isotopic and physico-chemical analyses performed on six rock glacier outflows in the Swiss Alps during the warm season. Similar chemical and isotopic analyses were performed in sources not fed by rock glaciers at all study sites. The ion content (SO4 (2-), Ca2+, Mg2+ and NO3 (-)) of the water emerging from active rock glaciers was globally higher than that of sources not fed by rock glaciers. Besides, the electrical conductivity and the ion content (SO4 (2-), Ca2+ and Mg2+) of the active rock glacier springs increased during the warm season, tracking the increasing perennial ground ice melting. We hypothesized that the ionic fingerprint of melting ice points mainly to the remobilization of chemical compounds stored during a colder period of the past in the cryosphere (e.g., the 1960s-1980s).

However, studies on their environmental behavior, specifically their adsorption-desorption behavior between sediment and seawater in estuarine and coastal areas, remain limited. To address this gap, our study focused on investigating the levels and behavior of 11 OPEs in sediment samples collected from the Beibu Gulf, South China Sea, encompassing estuaries and coastal regions. The total concentrations of 11 OPEs (sigma 11OPEs) in the sediments exhibit a significant decrease in summer, both in seagoing rivers (4.67 +/- 2.74 ng/g dw) and the coastal zone (5.11 +/- 3.71 ng/g dw), compared to winter levels in seagoing rivers (8.26 +/- 4.70 ng/g dw) and the coastal zone (7.71 +/- 3.83 ng/g dw). Chlorinated OPEs dominated the sediments, constituting 63 %-76 % of the total. Particularly, port and mariculture areas showed the highest levels of OPEs. Through load estimation analysis, it was revealed that the sedimentary OPEs in Qinzhou Bay (221 +/- 128 kg) had the highest load, with input from the Qin River identified as a significant source. Chlorinated OPEs showed a trend of desorption from sediments to the water column with increasing salinity, emphasizing the crucial role of land -based OPEs input through suspended particulate matter in rivers as a pathway to the ocean. The impact of strong flow in estuarine environments was highlighted, as it can scour sediments, generate suspended sediments, and release OPEs into the water bodies. Additionally, the results of the ecological risk assessment indicated that most of the OPEs posed low -risk levels. However, attention is warranted for the contamination levels of some chlorinated OPEs, emphasizing the need for ongoing monitoring and assessment.

The results showed no obvious thermocline in the vertical direction at Lake Erhai, while Chl-a demonstrated obvious spatiotemporal distribution characteristics in Lake Erhai. Chl-a concentrations increased to a maximum in summer in August with the low TN:TP value, leading to algal blooms, most notably in the southern lakes. Low pH and DO appeared due to the thermocline of Erhai Lake (August 2016). A large area of algae distribution due to the increase of total phosphorus appeared in the northern lake area of Lake Erhai in December 2016, with a tendency of mesotrophic to light eutrophic in summer by the nutritional evaluation of Lake Erhai, especially in the central lake area and the northern lake area. Pearson's correlation coefficient and principal component analysis showed a significant positive correlation between Chl-a and T (r = 0.34, p <= 0.01) and TP (r = 0.31 p <= 0.01) in the mesotrophic Lake Erhai, indicating that TP content was one of the triggering factors for the algal blooming. Based on the spatiotemporal changes in water quality parameters and their relationship with eutrophication, scientific agencies should implement management strategies to protect Lake Erhai, supplemental to the costly engineering measurements.					zhang, xiaonan/D-8565-2015	zhang, xiaonan/0000-0001-6947-945X														2073-4441				NOV	2022	14	21							3398	10.3390/w14213398	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14213398													WOS:000881508500001

Effects of glacier melting on the planktonic communities of two Antarctic coastal areas (Potter Cove and Hope Bay) in summer	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												Climate change has contributed to the regional retreat and melting of glaciers in the Antarctic Peninsula. This phenomenon is expected to affect the composition of plankton communities. The aim of this study is to analyze the influence of glacier melting on the composition and structure of phytoplankton and micro- and mesozooplankton assemblages in two coastal areas located in the northwest (Potter Cove) and in the northern end (Hope Bay) of the Antarctic Peninsula during summer 2013. We expect differences in plankton assemblages between PC and HB related to the fact that these areas are subjected to different climatic and environmental conditions and that the glacier meltwater is accumulated in lakes in HB whereas the meltwater directly reaches the adjacent sea at PC. However, plankton communities differed according to their proximity to the glaciers in both areas investigated, with a transition from herbivorous to microbial plankton food webs towards the glacier. The microbial food web was favored under the effects of glacier meltwater due to the stratification of the water column that favors the development of small eukaryotic algae. These are potential prey for ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates which, in turn, favors the development of small omnivorous copepods. Further away from the glaciers, the herbivorous food web consists of large phytoplankton and a greater representation of herbivorous mesozooplankton organisms. It can be inferred from this study that increases in atmospheric temperatures may favor the development of microbial plankton food webs in the Antarctic coastal seas during summer due to increased glacier meltwater.

J	Garland, D; Lucy, F; Touzet, N				Garland, Darren; Lucy, Frances; Touzet, Nicolas			Summer dynamics of cyanobacteria in an oligo-mesotrophic temperate lake in Northwest Ireland	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Despite the potential adverse consequences they can impart on biotopes, cyanobacteria are an understudied component of lake plankton communities in Ireland. This study, in summer 2019, examined cyanobacterial diversity and associated environmental variables in a lake previously impacted by algal blooms, in north-west Ireland. Vertical profiling showed that photosynthetic pigment concentrations were spatially heterogenous for the majority of the survey. However, water column homogeneity was observed towards the end of the survey, coinciding with increases in pigment concentrations. Sunshine hours, nutrient concentrations and wind speed were stable throughout the survey. Spatial homogeneity in pigments was attributed to an increase in minimal temperatures observed in the water column. PCR-DGGE analysis identified patterns in community composition, indicating a rise in cyanobacterial richness concomitant to increase in temperature and photosynthetic pigments. Band sequencing analysis identified phylotypes similar to the toxigenic species Microcystis sp. These were prominent at the end of the survey and coincided with the presence of the mcyE gene and low levels of microcystins, as indicated by real time PCR and ELISA analyses. The summer background presence of toxigenic cyanobacteria with potential bloom-forming capacity highlights the importance of annual lake cyanotoxin monitoring to inform resource management to protect human and animal health.						touzet, nicolas/0000-0002-8524-9184; Lucy, Frances/0000-0002-4785-2724													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2023	850	19					4327	4341		10.1007/s10750-023-05307-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-023-05307-2		AUG 2023											WOS:001060079500001

Landscape and climate on the northern Tibetan Plateau during the late Quaternary	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Palaeoclimate reconstruction on the northern Tibetan Plateau resulted in a large spectrum of different and partly divergent interpretations for the climate evolution during the late glacial and the Holocene. In some cases this is caused by incomplete understanding of the geomorphological processes influencing the different proxies used. To overcome these limitations and to enhance the understanding of the complex process interactions in a sensitive and highly dynamical environment a detailed analysis of different members of the sedimentary system at Lake Heihai on the northern Tibetan Plateau was conducted. Lake level variations during the late Pleistocene were influenced by sediment supply to an alluvial fan. This sediment surplus resulted in the temporary blocking of the outflow of Lake Heihai. High sediment supply presumably occurred during or shortly after large glaciations in the Kunlun Shan. The spatial distribution of aeolian sediments revealed a strong relationship to possible source areas. This resulted in a spatially heterogeneous distribution of the aeolian sediments. Furthermore, topographic effects have an important influence on the preservation of the sediments. Aeolian sediments deposited in sheltered positions might not be comparable with other archives with a similar grain size. Nevertheless, deposition of loess during the mid-Holocene indicates a shift to wetter climate conditions on the northern Tibetan Plateau. This might be caused by the intrusion of the East Asian Summer monsoon into the area. During the late Holocene, the Asian summer monsoon retreated and aeolian sediments were reactivated.

Dynamics of the dissolved organic matter in a stream-lake system within an extremely acid to neutral pH range: Agrio-Caviahue watershed	SPECTROCHIMICA ACTA PART A-MOLECULAR AND BIOMOLECULAR SPECTROSCOPY												The Agrio-Caviahue is a natural stream-lake system composed of the Upper Agrio River (UAR) -Lake Caviahue-Lower Agrio River (LAR). The system has a broad pH gradient from extremely acid in the hot spring to almost neutral pH only 60 km downstream the source, and varies as a function of the distance. The aim of this study was to analyze the dynamics of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) of this extreme system. For that matter, an absorbance and fluorescence-based characterization was performed on natural water samples and hydrophobic resin DOM extracts during different seasons in nine sampling stations. Between August and December, the hydrological connectivity is maximum due to precipitation and snowmelt, respectively. During these months, the stream that exits the lake governs the chemical characteristics downstream mainly in the period of high connectivity. In contrast, in the dry season when the flow of LAR is minimum, the two major affluents of this river influence its pH and DOM features, and deliver inputs of humified DOM from the wetlands where the tributaries are born. DOM was characterized by having low absorbance. The PARAFAC analysis of the fluorescent DOM (FDOM) validated three fluorescent components in the natural samples (with humic and non-humic features), two of which were also recorded in the extracts, meaning that no additional hydrophobic components were missed under the limit of detection of the fluorometer. The unique features of Agrio-Caviahue DOM resemble those found in DOM from Yellowstone hot springs, both acid and alkaline. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, assessment of the long-term association between the monsoon and precipitation in different regions remains difficult due to spatial chronological differences and uncertainties in interpretation of climate proxies. This study provides a novel insight into the interpretation of stalagmite oxygen isotopes (delta 18O) records and obtained synchronous ASM index series and precipitation variations in Northern China (NC), Central China (CC), and Southwestern China (SWC) over the last 1134 years (850-1983CE). The results show that the ASM index sequence is consistent with the trend evident in the monsoon intensity records from the region upstream of the water vapor source, which represents the response to the inter-hemispheric temperature dominated by effective solar radiation (ESR). Reconstruction precipitation data were in general agreement with the existing paleo-hydrological records of the regions, confirming the reliability and chronological accuracy of the reconstruction. Correlation analysis highlighted the significant regional heterogeneity in the destabilizing relationship between precipitation and the monsoon over the past millennium in Eastern China at sub-centennial scales. Specifically, the precipitation-monsoon relationships in three regions, NC, CC, and SWC, might be related to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the position of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), and solar activity, respectively. Moreover, at the millennial scale, a certain positive correlation between precipitation and ASM in NC and SWC was identified, whereas there was a weaker correlation between precipitation and ASM in CC. This study represents an attempt to further interpret the stalagmite delta 18O record, which can be generalized to larger and longer time scales.					; Fan, Haowen/GPT-4634-2022; Hu, Zunyu/NVL-8988-2025	Hu, Chaoyong/0000-0002-4821-9840; Fan, Haowen/0000-0002-1648-560X; Wu, Zhipeng/0000-0002-4542-9949; 													0277-3791	1873-457X				FEB 1	2024	325								108498	10.1016/j.quascirev.2023.108498	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2023.108498		JAN 2024											WOS:001153782800001

Pollution-tolerant invertebrates enhance greenhouse gas flux in urban wetlands	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												One of the goals of urban ecology is to link community structure to ecosystem function in urban habitats. Pollution-tolerant wetland invertebrates have been shown to enhance greenhouse gas (GHG) flux in controlled laboratory experiments, suggesting that they may influence urban wetland roles as sources or sinks of GHG. However, it is unclear if their effects can be detected in highly variable conditions in a field setting. Here we use an extensive data set on carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) flux in sediment cores (n = 103) collected from 10 urban wetlands in Melbourne, Australia during summer and winter in order to test for invertebrate enhancement of GHG flux. We detected significant multiplicative enhancement effects of temperature, sediment carbon content, and invertebrate density on CH4 and CO2 flux. Each doubling in density of oligochaete worms or large benthic invertebrates (oligochaete worms and midge larvae) corresponded to similar to 42% and similar to 15% increases in average CH4 and CO2 flux, respectively. However, despite exceptionally high densities, invertebrates did not appear to enhance N2O flux. This was likely due to fairly high organic carbon content in sediments (range 2.1-12.6%), and relatively low nitrate availability (median 1.96 mu mol/L NO3 -N), which highlights the context-dependent nature of community structural effects on ecosystem function. The invertebrates enhancing GHG flux in this study are ubiquitous, and frequently dominate faunal communities in impaired aquatic ecosystems. Therefore, invertebrate effects on CO2 and CH4 flux may be common in wetlands impacted by urbanization, and urban wetlands may make greater contributions to the total GHG budgets of cities if the negative impacts of urbanization on wetlands are left unchecked.

This data originated from subfossil and modern pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) materials comprising a continuous dendroclimatic record over the past millennium. Calibrating and verifying the MXD chronologies against the instrumental temperature data showed a promising opportunity to reconstruct warm-season (May through September) temperature variability. A new palaeotemperature record correlated statistically significantly with the long instrumental temperature records in the region and adjacent areas since the 1740s. Comparisons with tree-ring based (MXD and tree-ring width) reconstructions from northern Fennoscandia and northern Finland exhibited consistent summer temperature variations through the Medieval Climate Anomaly, Little Ice Age, and the 20(th) century warmth. A culmination of the LIA cooling during the early 18(th) century appeared consistently with the Maunder Minimum, when the solar activity was drastically reduced. A number of coolest reconstructed events between AD 1407 and 1902 were coeval to years of crop failure and famine as documented in the agro-historical chronicles. Results indicate an encouraging possibility of warm-season temperature reconstructions using middle/south boreal tree-ring archives to detail and enhance the understanding of past interactions between humans, ecosystems and the earth.																			1897-1695					SEP	2014	41	3					265	277		10.2478/s13386-013-0163-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s13386-013-0163-0													WOS:000338330700009

Geolocator tracking of Great Reed-Warblers (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) identifies key regions for migratory wetland specialists in the Middle East and sub-Saharan East Africa	CONDOR												Wetland-dependent migratory songbirds represent one of the most vulnerable groups of birds on the planet, with >67% of wetland-obligate species threatened with extinction. One of the major hurdles for conservation efforts is determining the migration routes, stopover sites, and wintering sites of these species. We describe an annual migration cycle revealed by geolocator tracking of Great Reed-Warblers (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) breeding in the Aras River wetlands of eastern Turkey. Because of its relatively large size and breeding ground fidelity, the Great Reed-Warbler is an excellent candidate for geolocator studies and can serve as an indicator species for other wetland songbirds, many of which are particularly threatened in the Middle East. All birds made use of at least 2 wintering grounds in South Sudan, on the Indian Ocean coast and on the western shores of Lake Malawi, as well as several important stopover sites. We also identified a counterclockwise migration path into and out of Africa. Throughout the year, these birds encountered 277 Important Bird Areas,>40% of which had little or no protection. Many species of wetland songbird, particularly threatened species, may be too rare or too small to be the focus of similar studies. Our results not only allow for comparisons with other Great Reed-Warbler populations, but also reveal previously unknown stopover and wintering locations to target conservation efforts that will help wetland-dependent bird species in the Middle East and East Africa.					; Buechley, Evan/I-2161-2019; Sekercioglu, Cagan/A-2331-2013; Herman, Jordan/JHT-1276-2023; Şaşmaz, Yakup/IUQ-6255-2023; Sekercioglu, Cagan H./A-1273-2007	Herman, Jordan/0000-0003-1377-5844; Buechley, Evan/0000-0001-5180-4824; Sasmaz, Yakup/0000-0002-9901-6453; Sekercioglu, Cagan H./0000-0003-3193-0377														1938-5129				NOV	2016	118	4					835	849		10.1650/CONDOR-16-63.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1650/CONDOR-16-63.1													WOS:000410571900009

T.; Plater, Andrew J.; Turner, Simon			EXCAVATIONS AT SITE C NORTH, KALAMBO FALLS, ZAMBIA: NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE MODE 2/3 TRANSITION IN SOUTH-CENTRAL AFRICA	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ARCHAEOLOGY												We report on the results of small-scale excavations at the archaeological site of Kalambo Falls, northern Zambia. The site has long been known for its stratified succession of Stone Age horizons, in particular those representing the late Acheulean (Mode 2) and early Middle Stone Age (Mode 3). Previous efforts to date these horizons have provided, at best, minimum radiometric ages. The absence of a firm chronology for the site has limited its potential contribution to our understanding of the process of technological change in the Middle Pleistocene of south-central Africa. The aim of the excavations was to collect samples for luminescence dating that bracketed archaeological horizons, and to establish the sedimentary and palaeoenvironmental contexts of the deposits. Four sedimentary packages were identified with the oldest containing Mode 2 and Mode 3 horizons. In this paper we consider the implications of the luminescence ages for the archaeological record at Kalambo Falls, and place them in a regional context. The reworking and preservation of the archaeological horizons is interpreted as the result of successive phases of meander migration and aggradation. Limited pollen evidence suggests a persistent floodplain palaeoenvironment with intermittent swamp forest and adjacent valley woodland, while mineral magnetic susceptibility data support an interpretation of river flow variability without any significant change in sediment provenance. The dynamics of the fluvial system cannot as yet be linked directly with regional climate change. The age range of similar to 500-300 ka for the oldest sedimentary package places the Mode 2/3 succession firmly in the Middle Pleistocene, and contributes to an expanding African record of technological innovation before the evolution of Homo sapiens.

Grain-size data from Genggahai Lake on the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau show that sand-sized particles in the lake sediments were transported primarily by strong winds to the lake and therefore can be used as a proxy for eolian activity. Eolian activity was weak from 10.3 to 6.3 ka, which may be a response to increased vegetation cover due to the strengthened Asian summer monsoon. In contrast, eolian activity occurred episodically when the summer monsoon weakened. The abrupt, intense sand deposition events are likely to have resulted from strong wind regimes, in turn linked to cooling events in the North Atlantic. Our results suggest that changes in atmospheric circulation patterns may have strongly affected the moisture balance and wind strength in the dust source area and hence dust emissions.

J	Britzius, S; Sirocko, F				Britzius, Sarah; Sirocko, Frank			Subfossil Coleoptera from Eifel maar sediments as indicators of the environmental evolution in Central Europe over the last 60,000 years	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												A reconstruction of landscape and paleotemperatures is presented from a composite drill core from the Eifel maar lakes of Auel and Holzmaar, Germany. The compositecore is 112 m long and covers the last 60,000 years (Marine Isotope Stages MIS 3, 2, and 1) based on the new ELSA-20 stratigraphy. Findings are based on an analysis of arthropod remains, with moisture-dependent, riparian or (semi)aquatic Staphylinidae representing the majority of beetle sclerites in the assemblages, especially during cold intervals. Assemblages change corresponding to climate and vegetation, with a greater variety of taxa during the woodland phases (60,000-44,000 yr b2k, i.e. years before 2,000 CE) versus cold adapted taxa during late MIS 3 and early MIS 2 (28,500-23,500 yr b2k). Beetles that inhabit damp, moist or wet locations, as well as aquatic or riparian taxa are present throughout the record. The assemblage corresponding to a period of tundra-like vegetation (29,000-24,000 yr b2k), contained three taxa suitable for temperature calculation (Arpedium brachypterum, Bembidion fellmanni, and Boreaphilus henningianus), all of which are found only in cold phases (Greenland Stadial 2 and 4, and Heinrich Event 2). Paleotemperatures were reconstructed via the Mutual Climatic Range method giving the following results. Mean temperature for the early tundra phase (28,500-27,800 yr b2k) is -32 to -2 ? for the coldest month, and 6 to 9.5 ? for the warmest month. Mean temperature for the later tundra phase (27,000-24,000 yr b2k) is -30 to -20 ? for the coldest month and 6 to 9.5 ? for the warmest month. This shift indicates an increase in seasonality towards the Last Glacial Maximum. Paleotemperature calculations are in good agreement with other European records and indicate a major decline in median winter temperatures towards the Last Glacial Maximum, whereas the summer temperatures remained relatively stable throughout Europe, resulting in an increase in seasonality and continentality.

Latnjavagge (9 km(2); 950-1440 in a.s.l.; 68° 20'N, 18° 30'E) was chosen as a representative drainage basin of the arctic-oceanic mountain area in northernmost Swedish Lapland. Atmospheric solute inputs, chemical denudation, and mechanical fluvial denudation were analyzed. During the arctic summer field seasons of 2000, 2001, and 2002 measurements of daily precipitation, solute concentrations in precipitation, and in melted snow cores, taken before snowmelt, were recorded. In addition, solute and suspended sediment concentrations in creeks were analyzed, and bedload tracer movements were registered during the entire summer seasons (end of May until beginning of September). Results show a mean annual chemical denudation net rate of 5.4 t km(-2) yr(-1) in the entire catchment. Chemical denudation in Latnjavagge is less than one third of chemical denudation rates reported for Karkevagge (Swedish Lapland) but seems to be at a similar level as in a number of other subarctic, arctic, and alpine environments. Mechanical fluvial denudation is lower than chemical denudation. Most sediment transport in channels occurs in the early summer season during a few days with snowmelt generated runoff peaks. The main sediment sources in the drainage basin are mobilized channel bed pavements exposing fines, ice patches/fields, and material mobilized by slush flows. The calculated mean mechanical fluvial denudation rate is 2.3 t km(-2) yr(-1) at the inlet of lake Latnjajaure, situated in Latnjavagge close to the outlet of the valley. A very stable vegetation cover and rhyzosphere in this environment mainly explain the low value. The mean mechanical fluvial denudation rate at the outlet of the entire Latnjavagge drainage basin, below lake Latnjajaure, is only 0.8 t km(-2) yr(-1). Both chemical and mechanical fluvial denudation show low intensity. The results from Latnjavagge support the contention that chemical denudation is a somewhat important denudational process in periglacial environments.

The results of chemical analysis of water from four cave pools, supplemented with concurrent samples from the American Fork River, suggest three modes of recharge: (1) diffuse recharge through the permeable matrix of the carbonate rock, (2) rapid recharge through open fractures in the epikarst, and (3) rapid recharge via piston flow through fractures occluded with colluvium. Water levels in the cave pools recharged by diffuse flow were very stable during the study period. Elevated dissolved solids characterized the geochemistry, including solutes associated with hydrothermal activity in this region (e.g., SO42- and F-). Isotopes of sulfur and carbon, along with cation-anion ratios suggest that sulfide oxidation may play some role in modern dissolution of the carbonate bedrock. In situ geochemical reactions influence the concentration of some solutes (e.g., HCO3-, Ca2+, F-) and may cause a shift in the isotopes of dissolved inorganic carbon. Water levels in the cave pools characterized by rapid recharge, in comparison, were highly variable. When the flow path was direct, the geochemistry of the pool was strongly influenced by the timing and rate of recharge. During times of limited recharge, the geochemistry of these pools evolved toward the values of pools dominated by diffuse flow. On the other hand, when the flow path was impeded by colluvium, recharge was stored, and the geochemical signal was homogenized. In both cases, the source of recharge may be from elevations substantially above the cave pool.

Horizontal and Vertical Distribution of Phytoplankton in the Alpine Lake Sevan (Armenia) during the Summer Cyanoprokaryota Bloom	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												A study of the horizontal and vertical distribution of phytoplankton in Lake Sevan was conducted in mid-July 2018 during the maximum Cyanoprokaryota blooms. The summer biomass of algae in the pelagic zone of the lake corresponded to values of mesatrophic waters. The Cyanoprokaryota biomass in Lake Sevan has horizontal and vertical heterogeneity and is related to the depth, morphometry of the lake parts, distribution of currents, transparency, temperature, and biomass of Cladocera. The specific number of phytoplankton species and water transparency decreases in areas where water blooms occur. The following factors contribute to the increase in the average phytoplankton biomass when compared to 2013-2017: (1) increased water temperature, (2) weakening of zooplankton grazing pressure due to the disappearance of Daphnia magna, and (3) increased phosphorus load due to increased contribution of D. longispina and Diaphanosoma lacustris to the zooplankton biomass.

To date these remnants, we conducted a salvage operation at two sites on in situ rooted tree stumps exposed below the lowest tide levels; these sites are no longer exposed. We obtained four radiocarbon dates on these tree remnants and reference an earlier site recovered in 1972. One wood sample was identified as Quercus robur or Q. petraea, while samples from Haverigg and Kirby-in-Furness are tree Salix spp. The median group age for the rising relative sea level (RSL) that killed the trees was 8602 +/- 243 bp cal a bp with an estimated Mean Tide Level (MTL) of similar to <=-9 m. Evidence indicates that RSL rose similar to 10 m along this section of coast at a rate of between of between 18.5 and 8.7 mm a(-1) until similar to 6800 cal a bp, or earlier, before the rate of global sea level rise fell below that of the local glacial isostatic recovery.

These rivers are inhabited by unionid freshwater mussels, which are used for oviposition by the endangered Itasenpara bitterling (Acheilognathus longipinnis). Water samples were collected every month between March 2011 and February 2012. Changes in bacterioplankton community structures were analysed using an approach that did not require cultivating the bacteria and involved PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The bacterioplankton community structures in the two rivers were similar in all seasons except winter. The bacterial sequences identified were dominated by typical freshwater Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, alpha-Proteobacteria, and beta-Proteobacteria bacterioplankton. Many beta-Proteobacteria species were detected in all seasons, but Bacteroidetes species were dominant in the winter. The bacterioplankton community structures were affected by biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, chlorophyll-a concentration, water depth, and water temperature. These results provide a foundation for a more detailed understanding of the conditions that provide a suitable unionid habitat.

J	Keiper, JB				Keiper, JB			Biology and immature stages of coexisting Hydroptilidae (Trichoptera) from northeastern Ohio lakes	ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												Orthotrichia aegerfasciella Chambers, Oxyethira forcipata Moseley, and Oxyethira pallida (Banks) are microcaddisflies (Trichoptera: Hydroptilidae) that commonly co-occur spatially and temporally. The larvae are algal feeders that specialize on Chlorophyta; O. aegerfasciella was reared on Cladophora, O. pallida was reared on Spirogyra and Zygnema, and a partial rearing of O. forcipata was obtained using Zygnema. Larvae used specialized asymmetrical mandibles to simultaneously grasp and puncture the walls of individual cells before sucking the contents out. Hypermetamorphosis occurred, and the final instars of both genera constructed cases of oral secretions only. Orthotrichia aegerfasciella early instars had unique tubercles on the notal setal areas, but these were absent in the fifth instar. The contention that Orthotrichia larvae lack a ventral projection on the fore tibia, a character present in other taxa that feed on filamentous algae, is incorrect. The fore tibia of O. aegerfasciella bears a ventral projection, and the projection possesses a pair of spurs similar to those in other algivorous Hydroptilidae. Also, the pointed labrum of this species does not aid in algal feeding. These observations contradict prior statements that Orthotrichia ancestors were predaceous because it was incorrectly assumed that they lack the apparatus for grasping algal filaments and have a labrum modified to aid their feeding habits. Orthotrichia aegerfasciella overwinters as a semiactive fifth instar. Oxyethira pallida fifth instars can be differentiated morphologically from the larvae of other described Oxyethira spp. based on mandible morphology, leg length, and coxal morphology. Larvae seal their cases in preparation for overwintering, over-winter as inactive fifth instars attached to stable substrates, and pupate during late spring.																			0013-8746					SEP	2002	95	5					608	616		10.1603/0013-8746(2002)095[0608:BAISOC]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0013-8746(2002)095[0608:BAISOC]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000178032700013

These events increasingly expose aquatic ecosystems, such as floodplain water bodies, to hydrological extremes. Simultaneously, anthropogenic river modifications like channelization and diking have been progressively disconnecting semi-aquatic ecosystems from the main river. Here, we examined how drought and hydromorphological modifications affect the water quality of floodplain water bodies. Specifically, we investigated 36 floodplain water bodies near the Elbe River in Germany and analyzed water samples from spring and late summer 2022. We assessed connectivity (past frequency of surface connection to the stream) and effects of drought (evaporation measured by changes in stable water isotopes) using a scoring system. This system evaluated impairment and habitat loss, allowing us to quantify the impact of hydrological disconnection on floodplain water bodies. Severe impacts, including low surface oxygen (<3 mg/L), products of anaerobic decomposition, fish kills, and dry-outs, primarily affected water bodies with low connectivity (<10 %). Multiple linear regression linked low connectivity and high evaporation to habitat degradation (r2 = 0.487, p < 0.001). Furthermore, dissolved oxygen concentrations increased with increasing chlorophyll a in connected lakes (p < 0.001), as expected, but no relationship was observed in disconnected lakes (p = 0.626). We attribute this lack of correlation to the decomposition of fine-grained organic sediments that have not been resuspended and flushed out in disconnected lakes. We conclude that river modifications for navigation reduce floodplain resilience to droughts, amplifying the effects of climate change on semi-aquatic ecosystems.

Survey of Pathologic Microorganisms in the Streams Along the Tahoe Rim Trail	WILDERNESS & ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE												Introduction- This study aimed to estimate the contamination of water sources along the Tahoe Rim Trail (TRT) through evaluation of the presence and concentration of Escherichia coli, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium spp. Methods- Sample sites were selected from 6 of the 8 sections of the TRT. Each stream was sampled 3 or 4 times during the summer and early fall of 2023. Samples were collected and analyzed for E. coli using Standard Methods 9223B and Giardia and Cryptosporidium spp. using EPA Method 1623. Results- E. coli counts ranged from <1 to 29.2 most probable number (MPN)/100 mL. There was no difference in contamination with E. coli between streams (P=0.287) or sampling rounds (P=0.413). Giardia counts ranged from 0 to 7 count/10 L. There was a difference in contamination with Giardia between the highest and lowest concentration streams (P=0.028) but no difference in contamination between other streams or between sampling rounds (P=0.924). Cryptosporidium counts ranged from 0 to 1 count/10 L. There was no difference in contamination with Cryptosporidium between streams (P=0.589) or between sampling rounds (P=0.888). Conclusions - E. coli, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium are present in the streams along the TRT. Results from this study show that the risk of illness from occasional direct consumption of water from the streams sampled is low; however, it is always advisable to filter or treat water from any backcountry source prior to consumption. More extensive studies are recommended to evaluate backcountry water sources in the Tahoe Basin to further evaluate the risk to human health from direct consumption.

J	Meyer, BS; Heritage, AC				Meyer, BS; Heritage, AC			Effect of turbidity and depth of immersion on apparent photosynthesis in Ceratophyllum demersum	ECOLOGY												On clear summer days the rate of apparent photosynthesis in C. demersum decreases progressively with depth of submergence. No indications were found that the rate of photosynthesis is less in plants just under the surface than in plants at greater depths. When Lake Erie water attains approx. its maximum turbidity the rate of photosynthesis in this species is markedly reduced even at depths of less than 1 m. During the summers of 1937 and 1938 at maximum turbidity the compensation point was at a depth of between 1 and 2 m.; at minimum turbidity it was at a depth of 8-10 m.

In this study, two peatland cores from the western and eastern sides of the Great Hinggan Mountains were investigated to better understand the climatic and environmental conditions and the measurements of black carbon (BC) and delta C-13-BC were used to reconstruct the fire history and environmental characteristics during the last millennium. Our results showed that the variations in the delta C-13-BC values are more sensitive to climate changes than the BC fluxes, and the climate forcing mechanisms differed between the two sides of the mountains. Lower delta C-13-BC values around 500 cal yr BP on the western side of the mountains indicated climate conditions were wetter than that on the eastern side, and were influenced by low sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic Ocean. The region east of the mountains was mainly influenced by the strong Asian summer monsoon, and the decreasing of delta C-13-BC values indicated climate conditions became wetter from 250 cal yr BP to the present and were wetter than that on the western side after 150 cal yr BP. Moreover, when one of these two forcing factors weakened and the other strengthened (e.g. from 400 to 150 cal yr BP), climate conditions in these two sides were similar.

Model simulations were used to quantify the extent to which the external phosphorus loading must be reduced to meet upcoming lake ecological quality requirements according to the European Union Water Framework Directive (WFD). The model generally showed good agreement with observed data for temperature and oxygen from the epilimnion and hypolimnion during the calibration period (7 years) as well as the validation period (S years); although peaks of oxygen concentrations in epilimnion during late spring often were underestimated. Phosphate and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations were generally well reproduced in both the epilimnion and hypolimnion, though hypolimnetic phosphorus was occasionally underestimated in late summer. There was also good agreement between monitored data and modelled biomass of diatoms and dinoflagellates as well as the zooplankton biomass of cladocerans and calanoid copepods, although the timing of biomass peaks occasionally deviated from observations. Root-mean-square-errors (RMSE), used to quantify the model error, were overall similar for the calibration and the validation period. Simulations of scenarios with a reduced external TP loading suggest that a substantial reduction (40-50%) of the TP loading is required if phytoplankton biomass is to drop to a level sufficiently low to meet the proposed WFD requirements (summer average <6.5 mu g chlorophyll a l(-1)). The predicted outcomes of considerable loading reductions should, however, be treated with some caution, as the conceptual model in this study could not fully account for the changes in trophic structure occurring at radically reduced TP loading. This particularly applies to changes in the fish stock, which may have extensive cascading effects via increased zooplankton grazing on the phytoplankton when external TP loading is reduced. This would most likely lead to higher transparency than that predicted by the model. To further improve the reliability of the predicted outcomes of various model scenarios, future work should include a series of test simulations also including fish predation. Today, fish predation is available in the DYRESM-CAEDYM model as well as other dynamic lake models; however, only sparse data is available on fish stock dynamics in Lake Ravn (as for most other lakes). An applicable test of the fish algorithms in today's dynamic models will require reliable estimates of fish stock biomass in the study lakes during both the model calibration and validation period.

A peak of chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations was followed by a rise of bacterial cell numbers and leucine assimilation rates, of the proportions of cells incorporating 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU), and of community net growth rates in dilution cultures. Incorporation of BrdU was low in Betaproteobacteria (2 +/- 1%), indicating that these bacteria did not incorporate the tracer. Pronounced growth of Betaproteobacteria in the enrichments was only observed after the decline of the phytoplankton bloom. An initial peak in the proportions of BrdU-positive Actinobacteria (30%) preceded a distinct rise of their cell numbers during the period of the Chl a maximum. Cytophaga-Flavobacteria (CF) changed little in numbers, but featured high proportions of BrdU-positive cells (28 +/- 12%). Moreover, CF represented > 90% of all newly formed cells in dilution cultures before and during the phytoplankton bloom. One phylogenetic lineage of cultivable Flavobacteria (FLAV2) represented a small (0.5-1%) but highly active population in lake plankton. The growth rates of FLAV2 in dilution cultures doubled during the period of the Chl a maximum, indicating stimulation by phytoplankton exudates. Thus, CF, and specifically Flavobacteria, appeared to be substantially more important for carbon transfer in Lake Zurich spring bacterioplankton than was suggested by their standing stocks. The high in situ growth potential of these bacteria might have been counterbalanced by top-down control.					; Shabarova, Tanja/B-5327-2015; Pernthaler, Jakob/A-2257-2008	Pernthaler, Jakob/0000-0001-7558-909X; Shabarova, Tanja/0000-0003-4526-3587; 													1462-2912	1462-2920				OCT	2009	11	10					2676	2686		10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.01994.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.01994.x								19601962					WOS:000270433700017

Lake herring populations in the Great Lakes collapsed during the middle third of the 20(th) century due to overfishing, degradation of critical habitat in major production areas, and interaction with exotic species. Fishery and habitat impediments to the recovery of lake herring have been removed, and it may now be possible to reestablish the species in its former habitats in the Great Lakes if adverse interactions with exotic species can be controlled within acceptable limits. To determine the potential for thermal niche overlap and adverse interaction with exotic fishes, juvenile (age-0) lake herring were held in the laboratory at 5, 10, 15, 18, and 21 degreesC, and fed ad libitum for 54 days. The optimum temperature for growth in weight was about 14.5 degreesC, indicating the fundamental thermal niche was 12.5-16.5 degreesC. Fish used in the growth study were also tested in a vertical thermal gradient tank to measure their final preferendum. The final preferendum, 16.5 degreesC, was in close agreement with the optimum temperature for growth and within the fundamental thermal niche. Both the optimum temperature for growth and the final preferendum have been used as measures of thermal niche, but this is the first time both measures were made on the same group of fish. Published information on the fundamental thermal niche, preferred temperatures, thermal habitat use, and feeding habits of alewives, rainbow smelt, and ruffe, indicates they will co-occur in spring, or summer with age-0 lake herring and that collectively they pose a predation threat to small, age-0 lake herring.																			0071-1128		3-510-47059-1				2002	57						335	342																WOS:000180355400028

However, research on water temperature change have not been actively conducted to date compared to the effect of water temperature on the river environment. Therefore, this study intends to study the change in water temperature from 2015 to 2021 through the change in the area of winter ice in the Hongcheon River. Optical satellite images were classified by referring to the field survey results, and the SAR satellite images tried to overcome the limitations of the input data by using the GLCM texture analysis method. After verifying the accuracy of all images used, the calculated monthly average ice area was compared with the temperature data of the adjacent AWS. It was found that there is a correlation between water temperature and ice area, and the results of this study can be used to study environmental changes in small-scale rivers that are difficult to access or do not have systems in place.																			1225-6161	2287-9307				DEC	2021	37	6	1				1599	1610		10.7780/kjrs.2021.37.6.1.9	http://dx.doi.org/10.7780/kjrs.2021.37.6.1.9													WOS:000740725700001

Nonlethal detection of PFAS bioaccumulation and biomagnification within fishes in an urban- and wastewater-dominant Great Lakes watershed	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are synthetic endocrine disruptors that are particularly stable and pervasive due to strong carbon-fluorine bonds. They are known to bioaccumulate in protein-rich tissues of fish, and most cannot be eliminated with cooking. Despite studies linking PFAS to adverse health outcomes, there is a lack of international regulations of PFAS as a hazardous material. To investigate PFAS in an aquatic food web and the potential human health implications, we analyzed the concentrations of 40 PFAS from muscle biopsy and serum samples of fish representing different trophic levels along the Lake Huron - Lake Erie Corridor. In Summer (2021), walleye (Sander vitreus; WAE), yellow perch (Perca flavescens; YEP) and round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus; ROG) were collected for analysis from the Detroit River (contaminated site) and St. Clair River (reference site). Eight PFAS congeners were detected in muscle and 15 congeners in serum, leading to the novel detection in Great Lakes fish of 7:3 FTCA in muscle and PFHpS, PFNS, MeFOSAA, and EtFOSAA in serum. PFOS was detected in 100% of muscle and serum pools across all species at concentrations lower than those associated with fish toxicity. Muscle PFOS concentration in DR WAE fell under the 8 meals per month (>13 ng-19 ng) fish consumption advisory according to the State of Michigan. Log bioaccumulation factor was significantly different (p = 0.01) among species in DR, driven by higher log BAF for WAE (3.8 +/- 0.1) compared to ROG (3.2 +/- 0.02). Biomagnification factor greater than 1 for all species in both rivers indicates that PFOS is biomagnifying in SCR and DR food webs. Successful detection and quantification of PFAS in the muscle and serum of three fish species demonstrates the potential for using this nonlethal sampling method to monitor PFAS and better understand ecological and human health impacts of PFAS exposure.																			0269-7491	1873-6424				MAR 15	2023	321								121123	10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121123	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121123		JAN 2023						36681373					WOS:000926359900001
J	BRUNING, K; LINGEMAN, R; RINGELBERG, J				BRUNING, K; LINGEMAN, R; RINGELBERG, J			ESTIMATING THE IMPACT OF FUNGAL PARASITES ON PHYTOPLANKTON POPULATIONS	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A population-dynamic model is formulated to estimate the impact of chytrid and related fungal parasites on phytoplankton populations. The specific loss rate of uninfected host cells due to infection is used as a measure of the impact. Calculating this loss rate requires information about four parameters: prevalence of infection (i.e. the proportion of the host cells infected), development time of the sporangia of the parasite, specific growth rate of the uninfected host, and difference between loss rates of infected and uninfected host cells due to loss factors other than parasitism. When only cell counts of the host population are available instead of growth and loss rate values, the model can be used to calculate a minimum estimate of the impact of the parasite. The impact of the parasite at a given prevalence of infection can vary considerably as a consequence of environmental effects on the latter three parameters. Therefore, prevalence is not a good parameter to judge the severity of fungal epidemics. A phytoplankton population starts to decline when prevalence exceeds a certain threshold value. This critical prevalence of infection can be calculated with the model and is also highly dependent on external conditions. The model is applied to epidemics of the chytrid Rhizophydium planktonicum Canter emend. in a population of the diatom Asterionella formosa Hass. in Lake Maarsseveen 1. The end of both the spring and summer 1984 bloom of the diatom was caused by epidemics of the chytrid. Model results suggested also that higher sinking rates, caused by an increasing proportion of dead cells in the colonies, resulted in an additional loss factor due to parasitism for this colonial diatom.																			0024-3590					MAR	1992	37	2					252	260		10.4319/lo.1992.37.2.0252	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1992.37.2.0252													WOS:A1992JD02300004

A 3-D concentration equation for passive tracers is added to POM to explore transport pathways and rates, plus retention zones and residence times. The 3-D structures of the current, density, and passive tracer concentration are examined for realistic bottom topography, idealized Alaskan coastal water inflow/outflow and idealized wind-forcing. Based on observational evidence and ecological concerns, the 'lake/river hypothesis' (i.e, the effect of weak versus strong throughflow on the ecology of the Sound) is explored to determine its influence on the circulation and transport patterns of passive tracers. Strong inflow through Hinchinbrook Entrance (river-like case) is crucial to the vigorous cyclonic circulation in the Sound and strong coupling to offshore influences, while with a weak inflow (lake-like case), the circulation in the Sound is much weaker and weakly coupled to offshore influences. The strength of the inflow and the wind direction are particularly important for determining the nature of the secondary branches of the throughflow in the northwestern Sound and the position, strength, and number of cyclonic and anticyclonic gyres, Mesoscale eddies are induced in the deep basins that have not yet been studied observationally. The advection of buoyant (relatively fresh) coastal water into the Sound significantly influences the circulation pattern and upper-layer density stratification. Idealized winter and summer wind-forcing generate distinctive surface circulation patterns that are important to the transport pathways, residence times, and retention zones of passive tracers; for example, northward and westward winds increase the northernmost penetration of passive tracers entering the Sound from offshore and the residence time substantially.

At the ice sheet surface, meltwater runoff forms a dynamic supraglacial hydrological system which includes stream and river networks and large supraglacial lakes (SGLs). Streams and rivers can route water into crevasses or into supraglacial lakes with crevasses underneath, both of which can then hydrofracture to the ice sheet base, providing a mechanism for the surface meltwater to access the bed. Understanding where, when, and how much meltwater is transferred to the bed is important because variability in meltwater supply to the bed can increase ice flow speeds, potentially impacting the hypsometry of the ice sheet in grounded sectors, and iceberg discharge to the ocean. Here we present a new, physically based, supraglacial hydrology model for the GrIS that is able to simulate (a) surface meltwater routing and SGL filling; (b) rapid meltwater drainage to the ice sheet bed via the hydrofracture of surface crevasses both in and outside of SGLs; (c) slow SGL drainage via overflow in supraglacial meltwater channels; and, by offline coupling with a second model, (d) the freezing and unfreezing of SGLs from autumn to spring. We call the model the Supraglacial Hydrology Evolution and Drainage (or SHED) model. We apply the model to three study regions in southwest Greenland between 2015 and 2019 (inclusive) and evaluate its performance with respect to observed supraglacial lake extents and proglacial discharge measurements. We show that the model reproduces 80 % of observed lake locations and provides good agreement with observations in terms of the temporal evolution of lake extent. Modelled moulin density values are in keeping with those previously published, and seasonal and inter-annual variability in proglacial discharge agrees well with that which is observed, though the observations lag the model by a few days since they include transit time through the subglacial system, while the model does not. Our simulations suggest that lake drainage behaviours may be more complex than traditional models suggest, with lakes in our model draining through a combination of both overflow and hydrofracture and with some lakes draining only partially and then refreezing. This suggests that, in order to simulate the evolution of Greenland's surface hydrological system with fidelity, a model that includes all of these processes needs to be used. In future work, we will couple our model to a subglacial model and an ice flow model and thus use our estimates of where, when, and how much meltwater gets to the bed to understand the consequences for ice flow.					; Leeson, Amber/JFA-1001-2023; Banwell, Alison/W-8180-2018; Lea, James/N-5699-2015	Leeson, Amber/0000-0001-8720-9808; Banwell, Alison/0000-0001-9545-829X; Fettweis, Xavier/0000-0002-4140-3813; 													1991-959X	1991-9603				OCT 19	2023	16	20					5803	5823		10.5194/gmd-16-5803-2023	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-5803-2023													WOS:001161774900001

The changing lake volume is predicted to have large-scale implication on the in-lake biogeochemistry. This study explores the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in a desiccating hypersaline lake (Sambhar Lake, India) along with adjacently located brine reservoir and salt pans by measuring concentrations and stable isotopic ratios of different C and N pools during winter and monsoon. Incubation experiments to estimate the net nitrification and mineralization rates in lake sediments were also performed. The Lake witnessed a large decrease in surface area and showed a clear signature of desiccation on lake biogeochemistry. Both particulate and dissolved fractions of C and N in the lake increased as the lake desiccated from monsoon to winter. Low N isotopic composition (delta N-15) of particulate organic matter during winter suggested the presence of N-2 fixers in this nutrient-rich saline environment. Taken together, significant difference in C and N concentrations and isotopic compositions were observed across the lake, brine reservoir, and salt pans, suggesting considerable modulation of in-lake processes due to human interventions.					; Rahman, Abdur/IAN-1727-2023; Sarkar, Siddhartha/NPI-9290-2025; Kumar, Sanjeev/JTV-5459-2023	Sarkar, Siddhartha/0000-0003-3317-0703; Bhushan, Ravi/0000-0003-1347-5446; KHAN, MOHAMMAD ATIF/0000-0001-9025-5119; , Abdur Rahman/0000-0001-6135-154X													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2023	850	20			SI		4557	4574		10.1007/s10750-023-05193-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-023-05193-8		APR 2023											WOS:000963619700001

Alirangues; Hilt, Sabine			Epiphyton phenology determines the persistence of submerged macrophytes: Exemplified in temperate shallow lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Submerged macrophytes are key components in many freshwater and marine ecosystems, contributing to ecosystem functions and services. In temperate shallow lakes, spring epiphyton shading can be decisive for submerged macrophyte development, potentially leading to macrophyte collapse and a shift to undesired, turbid conditions. Global change can alter epiphyton phenology; however, the consequences for submerged macrophytes and their stabilizing effects on clear-water conditions remain to be elucidated. Based on field data, we propose a general epiphyton shading phenology for submerged macrophytes in temperate shallow lake ecosystems. We express the temporal dynamics of epiphyton shading in terms of onset and relative increase (slope) of epiphyton development as well as epiphyton grazing impacts (onset, duration) using a Boltzmann function. This function is added to the ecosystem model PCLake+ as a customizable, macrophyte-specific shading factor. We then assess how changes in the epiphyton phenology and the presence of grazing on epiphyton affects submerged macrophyte biomass in a generic temperate shallow model lake under control and warm winter scenarios. The results from the model provide a proof-of-concept that epiphyton shading can provoke macrophyte loss and shifts between alternative equilibria. Threshold values for critical shifts depend on epiphyton shading phenology. Earlier onset and longer duration of grazing can maintain macrophytes in nutrient or climate conditions under which they would otherwise collapse. Our results show the pivotal importance of epiphyton phenology in determining lake ecosystem-wide responses stressing the need for better incorporation of epiphyton into both models and monitoring.

Nongeocentric axial dipole field behavior during the Mono Lake excursion	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												A new record of the Mono Lake excursion (MLE) is reported from the Summer Lake Basin of Oregon, USA. Sediment magnetic properties indicate magnetite as the magnetization carrier and imply suitability of the sediments as accurate recorders of the magnetic field including relative paleointensity (RPI) variations. The magnitudes and phases of the declination, inclination, and RPI components of the new record correlate well with other coeval but lower resolution records from western North America including records from the Wilson Creek Formation exposed around Mono Lake. The virtual geomagnetic pole (VGP) path of the new record is similar to that from another high-resolution record of the MLE from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 919 in the Irminger Basin between Iceland and Greenland but different from the VGP path for the Laschamp excursion (LE), including that found lower in the ODP-919 core. Thus, the prominent excursion recorded at Mono Lake, California, is not the LE but rather one that is several thousands of years younger. The MLE VGP path contains clusters, the locations of which coincide with nonaxial dipole features found in the Holocene geomagnetic field. The clusters are occupied in the same time progression by VGPs from Summer Lake and the Irminger Basin, but the phase of occupation is offset, a behavior that suggests time-transgressive decay and return of the principal field components at the beginning and end of the MLE, respectively, leaving the nonaxial dipole features associated with the clusters dominant during the excursion.																			2169-9313	2169-9356				APR	2014	119	4					2567	2581		10.1002/2013JB010846	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2013JB010846													WOS:000337688600002

To fill this gap, we investigated live (Rose Bengal stained) and dead benthic foraminifera from saline ponds, springs, and meadows in central Germany. For foraminiferal investigations, we collected surface samples along transects with changes in vegetation at Luisenhall, and Esperstedt in Thuringia. We found live and dead foraminifera at all investigated saline locations. We observed seven different agglutinated species that commonly inhabit coastal salt marshes (Trochamminita irregularis, Trochamminita salsa, Entzia macrescens, Miliammina fusca, Siphotrochammina lobata, Haplophragmoides manilaensis, and Haplophragmoides wilberti), one agglutinated species, Entzia sp., which has not been described to date, and one calcareous species, Gordiospira arctica, which has earlier been described from shallow-water settings at high northern latitudes. We hypothesize that foraminifera have been repeatedly transported to the inland saline habitats in central Germany by migratory birds on their routes from northern and southern Europe probably since the early Holocene. Future genetic investigations of the species in central Germany and comparisons with sequenced specimens from other localities will provide a better understanding of their provenance and phylogenetic position.

J	Peng, PY; Zhang, XJ; Chen, J				Peng, Peiyi; Zhang, Xunchang John; Chen, Jie			Modeling the contributions of oceanic moisture to summer precipitation in eastern China using 18O	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Ocean-continent interaction is an important component of the global climate systems and influences hydro-logical cycles at regional and local scales. Oceanic moisture (OM) advection and terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) are two main sources of precipitation in eastern China. The objectives of this study are to quantify the contribution of the OM to precipitation and to better understanding the water cycle processes in the region. Summer months when the East Asian monsoon is strongest are studied, and a two-component mixing model using O-18 as a tracer is applied to apportion the spatiotemporal contributions of OM. The Gaussian first-order approximation is employed to assess the uncertainty of the estimates. In the entire study area, OM predominates summer precipitation, with ET playing a supplemental role. The contributions of OM to precipitation decrease from June to August in Central China and Northern China. For example, in Central China the proportional contributions of OM are 94% in June, 92% in July and 81% in August. Spatially, the OM contributions decrease along the transport route from south to northeast. The 95% confidence intervals of the estimated contributions range from +/- 0.07 to +/- 0.38, with the standard errors between 0.03 and 0.17 for all months and sub-regions. The relative uncertainty contributions of each source to the total uncertainty follow the order of precipitating vapor > advection > ET. The large variances of delta O-18 in precipitable water vapor account for the most uncertainty of the proportional estimates.

J	SMITH, ND; SYVITSKI, JPM				SMITH, ND; SYVITSKI, JPM			SEDIMENTATION IN A GLACIER-FED LAKE - THE ROLE OF PELLETIZATION ON DEPOSITION OF FINE-GRAINED SUSPENSATES	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY PETROLOGY												Bow Lake is a small alpine lake in western Alberta, Canada, mainly fed by glacial meltwater. Suspended sediment loads, high only during summer months, are transported through the lake dominantly by interflows within the epilimnion. Consideration of interflow velocities and particle settling rates suggests that most clay supplied by stream inflow should be transported out of the lake during summer when thermal stratification is best developed. Field observatons show that clay comprises a persistent and significant component of lake-bottom sediment deposited during summer. This apparently anomalous clay-settling behavior can be attributed to production of fecal pellets found in both suspended sediment traps and bottom surficial deposits. The pellets, probably produced by pelagic copepods, are ovoidal with lengths typically ranging between 100 and 250 .mu.m and are composed of clay and silt. Measured settling rates in water at 5.degree. C ranged between 80 and 400 m/day. Pellet production, then, accelerates the downward transfer of suspended detritus, resulting in deposition of much of the fine sediment that would otherwise escape the lake in interflows. This confuses patterns of bottom-sediment texture and mineralogy which would ordinarily be expected from settling behavior of unpelletized suspensates.

The Krka River is a karstic Mediterranean river with specific travertine barriers and 2 lakes. The spring of the Krka River is located 45 kilometres from the coast. The river flows into the Adriatic Sea near the city of Sibenik. In 1998 and 1999, systematic collecting of Trichoptera was performed in that area, and in 2000, 2005, 2007 and 2009 caddisflies were collected periodically. Sampling was performed at 9 locations representing different types of habitats: springs, travertine barriers, upper, middle and lower parts of the Krka River and lakes. During 16 on-site visits, 4792 adults were collected, belonging to 50 species. Diversity, distribution, ecology and biogeography of this material were analyzed.

Inputs, source apportionment, and transboundary transport of pesticides and other polar organic contaminants along the lower Red River, Manitoba, Canada	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The Red River originates in the U.S., drains into Lake Winnipeg, and is a significant pathway for nutrients. We investigate its role as a source for pesticides, pharmaceuticals, per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), and microbes bearing antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). We delineate agricultural, urban, and rural land-use for organic contaminants to determine the extent of chemical transboundary riverine fluxes, and characterize levels and trends of organic contaminants and ARGs between spring and fall 2014 and 2015. The herbicide atrazine peaked at over 500 ng/L (14-day time-weighted average) near the border, indicating that the U.S. represents the major source into Canada from the Red River. Neonicotinoid insecticides had relatively constant concentrations, suggesting more widespread agricultural use in both countries. Pesticide concentrations were greatest post-application in June and July. Mass loadings of pesticides over the sampling periods, from the river to Lake Winnipeg, ranged from approximately 800 kg of atrazine, to 120 kg of thiamethoxam and clothianidin, to 40 kg of imidacloprid. Exposure distributions for atrazine exceeded benchmark water quality guidelines for protection of aquatic life (0.2% probability of exceeding chronic benchmark) with no exceedances for neonicotinoids. Seven pharmaceuticals were detected, mostly at low ng/L levels downstream of the City of Winnipeg wastewater treatment plant. Carbamazepine, the only pharmaceutical detected consistently at all sites, contributed on average 20 kg each year into Lake Winnipeg. While minor inputs were observed all along the river, city inputs represented the greatest source of pharmaceuticals to the river. Both PFASs and ARGs were observed consistently and ubiquitously, indicative of an anthropogenically-influenced system with no indications of any single point-source signature. While transboundary flux from the U.S. was an important source of pesticides to the Red River, especially for atrazine, observed concentrations of all measured contaminants suggest that known aquatic toxicological risk is minimal.

On the potential for reconstructed wetlands to remediate fecal coliform loading in an agricultural watershed	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Grand Lake St Marys (GLSM) is one of the most hypereutrophic lakes in North America and was officially declared distressed in 2011 as a result of excess nutrient runoff from primarily agricultural cropland and livestock facilities. Concurrently, the watershed has also struggled with excessive fecal coliform loads most evident by the routine public warnings regarding colony counts in GLSM. This study evaluated in stream trends and the potential for reconstructed wetlands along Coldwater Creek to reduce coliforms in the watershed. Non-Escherichia coli coliforms in Coldwater Creek showed a seasonal pattern, with a winter low coincident with the distressed watershed winter ban on manure application. E. coli coliform loads did not show the same seasonal pattern, but may have been offset by wildlife fecal inputs. When water flowed into the wetland, concentrations of total coliforms were reduced by 40%, mainly driven by residence time. When the wetland was a net sink, it reduced E. coli by 71% and non-E. coli coliforms by 51%. Unfortunately, it also served as a source for total coliforms 4 weeks of the year. Treating all tributaries into GLSM would require the equivalent of similar to 20x the current wetland area in the watershed.

CYBIUM					1st Ichtyological Conference in France, RIF 2000	MAR 29-31, 2000	PARIS, FRANCE					Very little is known about the diet of the European sturgeon, Acipenser sturio, in its natural environment. For the juveniles, a better understanding in this field is a step towards the assessment of this species' major feeding areas in the estuary with the aim of preserving and protecting them. From May 1998 to March 1999, stomach contents were collected by stomach flushing in 61 juveniles (63-116 cm total length) during monthly trawling campaigns to monitor sturgeon migration in the Gironde estuary. Specimens were mainly caught during spring (n = 41) and summer (n = 15) in two areas of increased abundance located in mesohaline (n = 19) and polyhaline (n = 32) sectors. Twelve taxa of preys were found. The highest proportion of preys identified consisted of polychaetes, mainly represented by Heteromastus filiformis Clarapede, Polydora sp. and some nereides in lower proportions. Crustaceans were the second most abundant group of preys. Preliminary work on the invertebrate fauna repartition in the estuary and literature show that these preys are benthic and are considered as very abundant only in the tidal areas, along the lateral strands. Moreover, the major taxa in the strand is represented by molluscs Macoma sp. and Hydrobia sp., which were absent from stomach contents. These observations indicate that young European sturgeons in the Gironde estuary show a strong preference for polychaeta and suggest they have a strong selectivity for the choice of their major trophic areas which are still to identify.

J	DAVIS, OK				DAVIS, OK			THE CORRELATION OF SUMMER PRECIPITATION IN THE SOUTHWESTERN USA WITH ISOTOPIC RECORDS OF SOLAR-ACTIVITY DURING THE MEDIEVAL WARM PERIOD	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Decreased solar activity correlates with positive cosmogenic isotope anomalies, and with cool, wet climate in temperate regions of the world. The relationship of isotope anomalies to climate may be the opposite for areas influenced by monsoonal precipitation, i.e., negative anomalies may be wet and warm. Petersen (1988) has found evidence for increased summer precipitation in the American Southwest that can be shown to be coincident with negative C-14 anomalies during the Medieval Warm Period. The present study compares palynological indicators of lake level for the Southwest with Petersen's data and with the C-14 isotope chronology. Percentages of aquatic pollen and algae from three sites within the Arizona Monsoon record greater lake depth or fresher water from A.D. 700-1350, between the Roman IV and Wolf positive isotope anomalies, thereby supporting Petersens's findings. Maximum summer moisture coincides with maximum population density of prehistoric people of the Southwest. However, water depth at a more northern site was low at this time, suggesting a climate-isotope relationship similar to that of other temperate regions. Further analysis of latitudinal patterns is hampered by inadequate C-14 dating.																			0165-0009					MAR	1994	26	2-3					271	287		10.1007/BF01092418	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01092418													WOS:A1994NP89000009

Loons were observed as either solitary individuals (65%) or in groups (35%, i.e., within <= 5 body lengths of another loon). Loons were more social (i.e., in groups) on transects with a river mouth (40.9% +/- 7.1) than on transects without a river mouth (24.2% +/- 5.4). The mean (+/- SE) dive duration for solitary loons was 71.3 +/- 7.7 s (n = 46, range 15-219 s) and several dives exceeded 2 min (22.2%, 10/46). Iu contrast, 15 foraging flocks were characterized by numerous shallow dives of <20 s. The mean group size (+/- SE) was 6.9 +/- 0.8 individuals and group foraging bouts lasted 8.3 +/- 1.2 min. In addition, Homed Grebes (Podiceps auritus) and Ring-billed Gulls (Larus delawarensis) joined loons forming multispecies foraging flocks, 26.7% and 13.3% of the time, respectively.

In this multi-proxy study, we use subfossil chironomids, pollen, loss-on-ignition, magnetic susceptibility, as well as major and trace element analyses from the sediments of a high alpine lake, Balea (2034 m a.s.l.), to reconstruct sub-century scale Holocene climate variability and environmental change. Chironomid-inferred average T-July at the lake is 9.3 degrees C today. The lowest temperatures around 6 degrees C were found in the Lateglacial (similar to 13,600 cal yr BP). In the Holocene (since 8330 cal yr BP), T-July ranged from 7.5 to 10.4 degrees C with cooler periods between 5500 and 4800 cal yr BP (similar to 8.9 degrees C) and around 4200 cal yr BP (similar to 9 degrees C). After 4200 cal yr BP, ln(Rb/K) ratios suggested increasing precipitation that likely affected the sediment composition of the lake. Our findings support the NAJ's summer impact in Eastern Central Europe by showing a similar to 0.5-1 degrees C multi-decadal summer cooling in periods with a more northerly position of the summer NAJ. Chironomid assemblage composition change at 4200 cal yr BP involved the increase of Micropsectra insignilobus-type and Heterotrissocladius marcidus-type, while Micropsectra radialis-type declined. In addition, the overall chironomid population size declined pointing to decreasing lake productivity.

Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) can be trapped by and accumulate in cold regions. To understand POP accumulation in temperate high mountain lakes, we collected samples of snow from the catchments of several high mountain lakes in Europe. 2. Organochlorine compounds (OCs) are regularly found in snow collected in European high mountain sites. Polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) were found in all samples examined. Hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) are also common whereas DDTs and hexachlorobenzene were found less frequently. 3. Comparison of the concentrations of these pollutants in snow with OC levels in the waters of these lakes or atmospheric deposition during cold periods shows that the snowpack constitutes a significant seasonal PCB reservoir in all catchments and that snow trapping is a major mechanism for the incorporation of HCHs in the lakes situated in the coldest sites, e.g. Gossenkollesee in the Alps. 4. Correlation of the concentrations of the PCB congeners in snow versus mean annual winter temperature shows higher accumulation at lower temperatures. The less volatile PCBs exhibit higher temperature dependences than the more volatile congeners. This trend differs from altitudinal dependences observed in other sites such as Canada and may be related to the specific range of winter temperature in each area of study.

Quantitative scale analyses were used to determine the origin and life-history attributes of adult fish captured during their spring spawning migration from 1995-1998. Hatchery males and females comprised 40% and 23%, respectively, of the spawning migration, while wild males and females comprised 19% and 18%, respectively. Male and female hatchery steelhead had shorter stream-residence durations (1 year) than wild fish (2 years). Both genders of hatchery individuals also reached reproductive maturity at younger ages (males, 3 years; females, 4 years) than wild fish (5 years). The number of years between repeat-spawning events was the same (1 year), irrespective of gender or origin. However, the number of fish captured during repeat-spawning events differed between origins (hatchery males: 42%; wild males: 9%; hatchery females: 23%; and wild females: 26%). The median number of years in lake residence prior to maiden spawning did not differ between hatchery and wild fish (males, 2 years; females, 3 years). Median length-at-age estimates differed between hatchery and wild male steelhead at age 4 (66 cm and 58 cm, respectively), while the median length-at-age for all other age classes did not differ, irrespective of gender and origin. Our results suggest that differences in life-history characteristics exist between hatchery-reared and wild-produced Carp River steelhead, and that system-specific management objectives should be considered prior to the initiation of stocking efforts.

The concentration fluctuated between 5.2 and 7.2 mg C l-1. No relationship between DOC concentrations and phytoplankton biomass or primary production was observed. Diurnal variations of a magnitude similar to variations on a weekly basis were found. A decomposition experiment showed the labile fraction was of a magnitude similar to the diurnal variation, i.e., 0.7 mg C l-1. By gel filtration (Sephadex G-50 and G-15) it was shown that 70-90% of the DOC pool was < 700 daltons and probably < 300 daltons. The labile fraction consisted of low molecular weight compounds.																			0043-1354	1879-2448					1982	16	6					815	821		10.1016/0043-1354(82)90010-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(82)90010-0													WOS:A1982NS97200010
J	Deemer, BR; Harrison, JA				Deemer, Bridget R.; Harrison, John A.			Summer Redox Dynamics in a Eutrophic Reservoir and Sensitivity to a Summer's End Drawdown Event	ECOSYSTEMS												In eutrophic lakes and reservoirs, reduced mixing during stratified conditions limits oxygen (O-2) supply to the hypolimnion (that is, bottom waters). In the absence of an O-2 supply, microbial decomposers consume alternative electron acceptors, generally in order of their thermodynamic favorability, releasing soluble, reduced manganese (Mn), iron (Fe) and methane (CH4) to the water column with implications for reservoir water quality and greenhouse gas dynamics. Still, there are very few studies that quantify intra- and inter-annual controls on lake and reservoir redox chemistry, especially in managed systems. To address this knowledge gap, we examined redox-sensitive water column chemistry before and during four summer's end water-level drawdown events (similar to 2 m in magnitude) in a eutrophic reservoir. We observed lower dissolved Fe and CH4 concentrations in years with higher hypolimnion O-2 and NO3-, suggesting that water column oxidant availability controls the extent of the redox cascade. During drawdowns, dissolved CH4, Mn and Fe concentrations increased in the hypolimnion (on average by 50%, 40% and 175%, respectively) concomitant with order of magnitude increases in methane bubbling rates (that is, ebullition). To our knowledge, this is the first in situ evidence for enhanced flushing of sediment pore water into a reservoir during water-level drawdowns. Furthermore, the mass of CH4, Mn and Fe released varied as a function of summertime redox conditions. Thus, the timing of reservoir water-level drawdowns may determine the degree to which reduced solutes enter the water column during drawdown, with longer pre-drawdown periods of hypolimnion hypoxia leading to higher solute fluxes.

Both wavelet analysis and redundancy analysis (RDA) were used to demonstrate not only the correlations between morphological parameters but also the correlations between morphology and environments. High coherence between morphological parameters, especially cell size, was confirmed; but the coherence, especially that between cell and filament, could easily be impacted by water turbulence which was associated with discharge, this might reflect the interaction between life cycle and size selectivity. Moreover, phase angles in wavelet figures illustrated that cell diameter was the most sensitive parameter to environmental variations, and changes in cell diameter triggered the size change in both cell and filament; thus through this way cell and filament size variations could be related. Based on the annual variation pattern of morphological parameters, the morphology of A. granulata exhibited an integrated cycle; during which morphological parameters might have different responses to physicochemical factors. Water temperature was closely associated with algal occurrence rates and size values during the spring winter period. Algal life cycle could be affected by discharge, as well as filament length by allowing for selection of chains with optimum buoyancy. The responses of algal sizes to nutrients, especially silicate, phosphate, and total nitrogen, were associated with the start and end of a life cycle. These correlations between size and nutrients were supported by both wavelet analysis and RDA. Moreover, the extremely high values at the end of the year were explained as algal recruitment from benthos. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Hairston, NG; Hansen, AM; Schaffner, WR				Hairston, NG; Hansen, AM; Schaffner, WR			The effect of diapause emergence on the seasonal dynamics of a zooplankton assemblage	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY					Workshop on Plankton Population Dynamics: Food Web Interactions and Abiotic Constraints	NOV, 1998	CONSTANCE, GERMANY					1. The role of seasonal phenology in the emergence of zooplankton from diapause in patterns of seasonal abundance in the water column was investigated in Oneida Lake, New York. Replicate emergence traps, placed in contact with the lake sediments at two locations (one at a shallow site and one at a deep site), were monitored between May and August. 2. Although six rotifer taxa showed a clear seasonal succession in the water column throughout the study period, all but one taxon emerged exclusively in spring. Three cladoceran and three calanoid copepod species, also present in the water column throughout the study period, again showed predominantly spring emergence. In contrast, three cyclopoid copepod species had distinct seasonal periods of emergence that corresponded, at least in part, to the timing of abundance peaks in the plankton. 3. These results for a single lake are largely consistent with patterns observed or inferred by other investigators for other lakes: variable dependence of abundance in the plankton on diapause emergence for species with long-lived diapausing eggs (i.e. rotifers, cladocerans and calanoid copepods), and much closer dependence for species with short-lived diapausing immature stages (i.e. cyclopoid copepods).																			0046-5070					OCT	2000	45	2					133	145																WOS:000165086500004

There are, however, no harmonized analyses of areal precipitation to show the exact increase. 2) The annual maximum of the areal water equivalent of snow has been increasing in eastern and northern Finland but decreasing in the south and west during the period 1947-2001. 3) The winter runoff has generally been increasing strongly in southern and slightly in central Finland during the 20th century. In northern Lapland there are no signs of increase in winter or annual flow. Annual discharge in the south and west has also increased to some extent. 4) The existing analyses show no signs of long-term trends in annual evapotranspiration. 5) Long-term fluctuations of water stage have been observed in the major groundwater formations. 6) The series of the date of ice break-up in the river Tornionjoki - starting in 1693 - shows that in recent decades the ice cover of the river has broken up about two weeks earlier than in the beginning of the period. 6) Lake ice maximum thickness series show no noticeable trend. 7) Lake water temperature in south-eastern Finland seems to have been increasing slightly during the period starting in 1924; in central and northern Finland no trends in water temperature have been observed.																			0029-1277						2003	34	1-2					71	90																WOS:000181895300006

We investigate the importance of a refuge from fish predation to the abundance, species composition and seasonal succession of zooplankton. Thirty lakes representing a range of depths were sampled twice in summer for physical/chemical parameters and zooplankton community structure. 2. We define the refuge from centrarchid predators to be that space between the thermocline and the zone of anoxia. As lakes vary in rate of oxygen depletion from the hypolimnion, the refuge size and lake depth are independent; refuge size decreases during the summer peroid. 3. Lake depth and refuge size independently explain variation among lakes in zooplankton species composition, but seasonal community change within lakes is best predicted by loss of refuge size. 4. Refuge size also explains the substantial variation in the relative dominance of the two major daphnid species. Lakes possessing a large refuge are dominated by D. pulicaria; those with a small refuge are dominated by the smaller, D. galeata mendotae. We suggest that lakes of intermediate refuge size, which are characterized by high species diversity, represent a more equitable balance of predation and competition.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				FEB	1991	25	1					85	93		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1991.tb00475.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1991.tb00475.x													WOS:A1991FA88500009

Multi-annual monitoring of water stable isotopes, air temperature, relative humidity, drip rates and P-CO2 in surface, soil and cave air gives detailed insight into dripwater isotopes, temperature and ventilation dynamics in Mawmluh Cave, NE India. Water isotopes vary seasonally in response to monsoonal rainfall. Most negative values are observed during late Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM), with a less than one-month lag between ISM rainfall and drip response. Two dry season and two less-well distinguishable wet season dynamic ventilation regimes are identified in Mawmluh Cave. Cave air temperatures higher than surface air result in chimney ventilation during dry season nights. Dry season days show reduced ventilation due to cool cave air relative to surface air and cold-air lake development. Both, high water flow and cooler-than-surface cave air temperatures result in air inflow during wet season nights. Wet season daytime ventilation is governed by river flow, but is prone to stagnation and development of cold air lakes. CO2 monitoring indicates that P-CO2 levels vary at diurnal to annual scale. Mawmluh Cave seems to act as CO2 sink during part of the dry season. While very likely, additional data is needed to establish whether wet season cave air CO2 levels rise above atmospheric values. Drip behavior is highly nonlinear, related to effective recharge dynamics, and further complicated by human influence on the epikarst aquifer. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

High Microcystis biovolume in the TZ suggests the possibility that the conditions in these waters support a greater Microcystis growth rate relative to the open lake. To test this hypothesis, during the 2008 bloom, Microcystis was collected from western Lake Erie for measurements of total protein content (TPC) as an indicator of growth rate potential and cellular nutrient content to indicate nutrient deficiencies. TPC results indicate that Microcystis in the TZ had a higher potential growth rate compared to offshore waters. TPC values in Maumee Bay were intermediate but not significantly different from the 17 and offshore. Nitrogen content of Microcystis remained high over the summer at all sites, despite very low dissolved nitrate concentrations and low total nitrogen-to-total phosphorus ratio in late summer in the lake. Ammonium level in the lake was constant during the summer, and likely provided the nitrogen source for Microcystis. Cellular phosphorus content varied between site and sample date suggesting that Microcystis was moderately phosphorus deficient. Quotas of micronutrient indicated that Microcystis was not deficient of micronutrients. Results of this study suggest the waters in and adjacent to Maumee Bay provide more favorable growth conditions for Microcystis than offshore waters.

Influence of dam-induced hydrological regulation on summer water temperature: Sauce Grande River, Argentina	ECOHYDROLOGY												This study quantifies for the first time the influence of flow regulation on the river thermal behaviour of an ungauged basin located in central-eastern Argentina. A 30-day data set of continuous summer hourly data was assembled for eight water temperature gauging sites deployed along the main channel upstream and downstream from the impoundment. Analysis methods include descriptive statistics of daily temperature data, classification of diurnal regimes by relative differences in the 'shape' and the 'magnitude' of the thermographs (RSMC), and quantification of the climatic sensitivity of water temperature regimes using a sensitivity index. Results revealed that temporal fluctuations in water temperatures were linked to meteorological drivers; however, spatial variability in the shape and the magnitude of the thermographs revealed the effects of the dam in regulating river thermal behaviour downstream. Water temperatures immediately below the dam were reduced notably; diurnal cycles were reduced in magnitude, delayed in timing, and revealed overall climatic insensitivity and high temporal stability in regime shape. Dam effects persisted along the 15-km stretch monitored, although declined in the downstream direction. These findings provide new scientific understanding about the river water quality and inform river management about potential shifts in summer water temperature with great implications for the diversity and lifecycles of Neotropical river fauna. The use of the RSMC and sensitivity index approaches in water temperature assessment is novel and has wider applicability for quantifying river thermal regimes and their sensitivity to drivers of change over a range of temporal and spatial scales.

The effects of aridity on conifer radial growth, recruitment, and mortality patterns in the eastern Sierra Nevada, California	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Understanding natural variability in precipitation and drought, and the resulting effects on Sierra Nevada forests, is crucial for successful resource management in this environmentally sensitive area of California. This study assessed the species-specific influence of precipitation variations on radial growth, recruitment, and mortality patterns for three conifer species (Pinus jeffreyi, Juniperus occidentalis, and Pinus contorta) in two mid-elevation lake catchments over the past 550 years. The P. jeffreyi chronology was the most highly correlated with winter precipitation patterns, although the other two species also exhibited significant correlations. Ring-width patterns suggest the influence of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on winter precipitation over the length of the records. Recruitment patterns displayed significant, though directionally distinct, correlations with winter drought: P. contorta exhibited increased recruitment during extended drought periods, while P. jeffreyi and J. occidentalis showed increased recruitment during wetter intervals. Finally, a ring of dead trees around both lakes is evidence of a late 20th century water level rise, likely caused by earlier snowmelt and/or wetter conditions. Moisture availability has exerted a strong influence on Sierra Nevada forests through time, but the strength of tree-growth response, and even the sign of tree population response, has been species-specific.

Tectonically controlled drainage fragmentation in the southwestern Great Basin, USA	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												The area now occupied by the Great Ba-sin, western USA, contained paleo-fluvial systems that predated the modern-day en-dorheic (closed) basins. The areal extent of these paleo-fluvial systems within the south-western Great Basin is known mainly from isolated remnants preserved in the modern mountain ranges. We document the age, ex-tent, and tectonic disruption of Mio-Pliocene fluvial systems of the southwestern Great Basin. Synthesis of new field observations, geochemistry, and geochronology with ex-isting studies defines two latest Miocene to Pliocene east-southeast flowing drainages that predated the modern endorheic ba-sins. The drainage network was ultimately fragmented in Pliocene time (ca. 3.5-4 Ma). Fragmentation of the drainage network led to lake formation, drying of lakes, and the formation of isolated springs. The rapid envi-ronmental changes initiated by faulting and volcanism isolated previously interbreeding populations of spring-dwelling taxa and have caused divergent evolution since Pliocene time. Modern endemism within the region's springs is thus a direct consequence of intra-plate tectonism.																			0016-7606	1943-2674				2022 DEC 20	2022										10.1130/B36563	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B36563		DEC 2022											WOS:000904019700001
J	McAllister, AJ				McAllister, AJ			Wetland habitat use by the Black Rat Snake, Elaphe obsoleta, in Eastern Ontario	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												Wetland habitat use by the Black Rat Snake, Elaphe obsoleta, in the form of a swamp, is documented at Charleston Lake Provincial Park, Ontario. Three of seven individuals radio-tracked during the summers of 1990 and 1991 were found to exhibit a seasonal pattern of wetland habitat use, with the snakes initially spending the majority of their time in a swamp during the month of June. As the summer progressed, the percentage of total observations of the snakes in the swamp decreased. This observed pattern of use of a wetland habitat may have coincided with breeding activity of birds or perhaps the snakes were responding to the forest/swamp ecotone. In light of this species, limited range in Canada and the idea fostered in the literature that associates this snake with non-aquatic habitats, potential use of wetlands by Black Rat Snakes should be examined to aid in the better understanding of this species, and hence lead to better management in the northern periphery of its range.																			0008-3550					OCT-DEC	1995	109	4					449	451																WOS:A1995TY60500013

A total of 28 phyla were detected, with phytoplankton occupying the highest percentage of sequences (accounting for up to 98 %). The dominant taxa consisted of Chrysophyta, Chlorophyta, and Cryptophyta. The species richness (113-268) and Shannon index (1.70-3.50) varied among the lakes, with higher values recorded in Lake Chang Hu and Lake Kitec and the lowest value obtained for Lake Yue Ya. There were significant differences between the microbial eukaryotic communities of the lakes, with spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the relative abundance of the dominant taxa (P < 0.05). Environmental variables explained about 39 % of the variation in community structures, with water temperature and phosphate identified as the driving factors (P < 0.05). Network analysis revealed comprehensive co-occurrence relationships (positive correlation 82 % vs. negative correlation 18 %). The neutral community model revealed that neutral processes explained more than 55 % of the community variation. Stochastic processes (e.g. homogenizing dispersal and undominated processes) predominated in community assembly over the deterministic processes. These findings demonstrate the diversity of the microbial eukaryotic communities in the freshwater lakes of the Fildes Peninsula and have important implications for understanding the community assembly in these ecosystems.

Radon fluxes at four uranium mill tailings disposal sites after about 20 years of service	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY												To evaluate the properties of earthen covers over uranium mill tailings disposal cells after about 20 years of service, we measured Rn-222 fluxes and radon barrier properties at the Falls City, TX, Bluewater, NM, Shirley Basin South, WY, and Lakeview, OR disposal sites in western USA. A total of 115 in-service Rn fluxes were obtained at 26 test pit locations from the top surface of the exposed Rn barrier (i.e., after protective layers were removed by excavation) and 24 measurements were obtained from the surface of the underlying waste after excavation through the Rn barrier layer. Rn-222 concentrations were determined in accumulation chambers using a continuously monitoring electronic radon monitor (ERM) equipped with a solid-state alpha particle detector. Effects of surface features on Rn flux including vegetation, seasonal ponding, and animal burrowing were quantified. Comparison of measured fluxes with values that were measured shortly after the Rn barriers were completed (as-built) show that most measurements fell within the range of the as-built fluxes, generally at very low fluxes. At two sites fluxes were measured that were greater than the highest as-built flux. High fluxes are typically caused by a combination of enhanced moisture removal and preferential pathways for Rn transport, often caused by deep-rooted plants. Such localized features result in a spatially heterogeneous distribution of fluxes that can vary substantially over only a meter or two.

The cave is fed by a karst system and its dimensions permit exploration through use of diving. Inside the cave a small underground lake was discovered and its level was monitored by deploying a water-level data-logger and comparing it with the rainfall measured in the area. First results highlight the fast response of the lake level to the rainfall; this is in agreement with the characteristics of a system fed by large karst conduits.																			1756-0543	1756-0551				JUL	2010	29	2	1							10.3723/ut.29.095	http://dx.doi.org/10.3723/ut.29.095													WOS:000437621000006

The study area is Old Crow Flats, Yukon, in the Canadian Arctic. HH and HV backscatter from lake ice is shown to have significant temporal variability and interlake diversity. Backscatter thresholds are statistically estimated to discriminate decaying lake ice from open water. A classification methodology is described that uses a HH backscatter threshold to identify initial break-up and a HV backscatter threshold for the main period of break-up. Classification accuracies are >81% ((K) over cap = 0.189) prior to initial break-up and 66%-97% ((K) over cap = 0.353-0.868) during break-up. This study demonstrates the potential of RADARSAT-2 imagery and, by extension, other C-band SAR satellites, to provide lake ice break-up information in support of monitoring and reporting requirements, subsequent decision-making, and scientific tasks for the Government of Canada.

However, how these various circulation systems interacted in the region during the Holocene, and the nature of the associated environmental impacts, are unclear and even controversial. Here we present a high-resolution pollen record from Caodalian Lake since 7.9 ka (1 ka = 1,000 cal yr BP), which is used to reconstruct the regional vegetation history and climatic changes. In addition, we use a novel procedure for pollen-based quantitative paleoclimatic reconstruction to characterize the evolution of precipitation at Caodalian Lake and nearby Qinghai Lake. The results suggest that mean annual precipitation (P-ann) is the most significant factor controlling the fossil pollen record at both sites, and the P-ann reconstructions are well correlated with each other (r = 0.72, p < 0.001). A synthesis of the P-ann records from the two sites indicates that the precipitation in the region began to increase before 10 ka, reached a maximum during 10-5 ka, and gradually decreased thereafter. We propose that the pattern of precipitation evolution in the Qinghai Lake basin resulted from the combined effects of the ISM and EASM, with a precipitation maximum of 10-7 ka for the ISM and 7-5 ka for the EASM; both systems contributed to the regional precipitation maximum during 10-5 ka. Our well-dated and unambiguous P-ann record also provides the opportunity to reconcile paleoenvironmental reconstructions derived from different paleoenvironmental proxies from the Qinghai Lake basin.					; Wang, zhenqian/HNS-6301-2023; Lv, Feiya/ABB-8018-2021; Wu, Duo/ACI-5090-2022; Zhang, Xu/AFX-8847-2022; Chen, Jianhui/A-5340-2011; Cao, Xianyong/L-7168-2019; Yan, Jingjing/B-1285-2019; Fahu, Chen/B-2788-2011; Zhou, Aifeng/C-5881-2013	Huang, Xiaozhong/0000-0002-2127-0451; chen, xuemei/0000-0002-2323-0437; Zhou, Aifeng/0000-0001-8349-8585; Chen, Jianhui/0000-0002-6768-1619; Wang, Haipeng/0000-0002-3666-2001; Wang, Zhenqian/0000-0002-1743-2227; 													2572-4517	2572-4525				APR	2021	36	4							e2020PA004126	10.1029/2020PA004126	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020PA004126													WOS:000644566400025

However, little is known regarding the life cycle of the species. A 2-year survey was conducted to clarify the movement and dispersal of S. microdon throughout its life history in Lake Hinuma, a brackish lake in central Japan. Results of the survey revealed that from emergence in spring to maturation and spawning the following spring, S. microdon was found within Lake Hinuma all year round. Although there are seasonal occurrences of the species in Shimohinuma River, a river flowing out of Lake Hinuma, when the river shows a well-mixed vertical profile, S. microdon was not found in coastal waters adjacent to the lake, disproving any diadromous life history of the species. Comparisons of standard length, body weight and gonadosomatic index of S. microdon caught within the lake and in the river did not show any significant differences. It was concluded that S. microdon is dependent upon the brackish environment, undertaking its complete life history within the Lake Hinuma water system. This small species is one of the few brackish water species in Japanese waters.																			0021-5392					FEB	1992	58	2					235	248																WOS:A1992LC66800010

Examination of the watershed-wide distribution of Escherichia coli along southern Lake Michigan:: an integrated approach	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Recent research has highlighted the occurrence of Escherichia coli in natural habitats not directly influenced by sewage inputs. Most studies on E. coli in recreational water typically focus on discernible sources (e.g., effluent discharge and runoff) and fall short of integrating riparian, nearshore, onshore, and outfall sources. An integrated "beachshed" approach that links E. coli inputs and interactions would be helpful to understand the difference between background loading and sewage pollution; to develop more accurate predictive models; and to understand the differences between potential, net, and apparent culturable E. coli. The objective of this study was to examine the interrelatedness of E. coli occurrence from various coastal watershed components along southern Lake Michigan. The study shows that once established in forest soil, E. coli can persist throughout the year, potentially acting as a continuous non-point source of E. coli to nearby streams. Year-round background stream loading of E. coli can influence beach water quality. E. coli is present in highly variable counts in beach sand to depths just below the water table and to distances at least 5 In inland from the shore, providing a large potential area of input to beach water. In summary, E. coli in the fluvial-lacustrine system may be stored in forest soils, sediments surrounding springs, bank seeps, stream margins and pools, foreshore sand, and surface groundwater. While rainfall events may increase E. coli counts in the foreshore sand and lake water, concentrations quickly decline to prerain concentrations. Onshore winds cause an increase in E. coli in shallow nearshore water, likely resulting from resuspension of E. coli-laden beach sand. When examining indicator bacteria source, flux, and context, the entire "beachshed" as a dynamic interacting system should be considered.

We present the results of a field study of the summer ER dynamics of the cosmopolitan rotifer Keratella cochlearis (Gosse, 1851), in a eutrophic central Texas reservoir, USA. Relationships between ER and water temperature, Secchi depth, population density, food resources, and potential competitors and predators were studied by single correlation and multiple regression analyses. Low values of ER were concurrent with low and decreasing numbers of the edible phytoplankton fraction and with the increasing number of the inedible fraction suggesting food limitation. ER was significantly correlated inversely with population density and positively with free bacteria and heterotrophic nanoflagellates. No significant correlations were found with abiotic factors and competitors and predators. Significant multiple regression models with the best predictive variables highlighted the importance of intraspecific interactions on ER. Thus, intraspecific interactions and food resources emerged as the main controls acting on the summer ER dynamics of K. cochlearis in this reservoir.

Bacterial Community Composition and Dynamics Spanning Five Years in Freshwater Bog Lakes	MSPHERE												Bacteria play a key role in freshwater biogeochemical cycling, but long-term trends in freshwater bacterial community composition and dynamics are not yet well characterized. We used a multiyear time series of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data from eight bog lakes to census the freshwater bacterial community and observe annual and seasonal trends in abundance. The sites that we studied encompassed a range of water column mixing frequencies, which we hypothesized would be associated with trends in alpha and beta diversity. Each lake and layer contained a distinct bacterial community, with distinct levels of richness and indicator taxa that likely reflected the environmental conditions of each lake type sampled, including Actinobacteria in polymictic lakes (i.e., lakes with multiple mixing events per year), Methylophilales in dimictic lakes (lakes with two mixing events per year, usually in spring and fall), and "Candidatus Omnitrophica" in meromictic lakes (lakes with no recorded mixing events). The community present during each year at each site was also surprisingly unique. Despite unexpected interannual variability in community composition, we detected a core community of taxa found in all lakes and layers, including Actinobacteria tribe acI-B2 and Betaprotobacteria lineage PnecC. Although trends in abundance did not repeat annually, each freshwater lineage within the communities had a consistent lifestyle, defined by persistence, abundance, and variability. The results of our analysis emphasize the importance of long-term multisite observations, as analyzing only a single year of data or one lake would not have allowed us to describe the dynamics and composition of these freshwater bacterial communities to the extent presented here. IMPORTANCE Lakes are excellent systems for investigating bacterial community dynamics because they have clear boundaries and strong environmental gradients. The results of our research demonstrate that bacterial community composition varies by year, a finding which likely applies to other ecosystems and has implications for study design and interpretation. Understanding the drivers and controls of bacterial communities on long time scales would improve both our knowledge of fundamental properties of bacterial communities and our ability to predict community states. In this specific ecosystem, bog lakes play a disproportionately large role in global carbon cycling, and the information presented here may ultimately help refine carbon budgets for these lakes. Finally, all data and code in this study are publicly available. We hope that this will serve as a resource for anyone seeking to answer their own microbial ecology questions using a multiyear time series.

Different aspects of the water chemistry are treated in relation to the capacity of organic production of the lake. The water temperature of the ice-free season largely follows the changes in the maximum of the air temperature. Respiratory processes are predominant in the lake. The yearly average degree of O2 saturation was about 60%. During the winter the entire lake can be completely O2-free for some time. PO4-P is low in the lake and the total P is lower than in several Uppland lakes investigated by Lohammar (1938). The phosphate released during the periods of stratification from the sediment is rapidly taken up by the living organisms. NO3-N is low during the ice-free season. At the end of the winter stratification comparatively high values of NO3-N occur in the upper water ayers. The variations In silica concentration are governed by several factors. In the bottom water silica and CO2 show a similarity in development with time.																			0030-1299	1600-0706					1966	17	1					33	+		10.2307/3564780	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3564780													WOS:A19668207900004

After construction of dams, especially Claytor Dam in 1939, the population declined and non-native walleye were stocked. Stocking of non-native walleye was stopped in 1997, and molecular marker data showed that the presumptive native population had persisted. To restore the native stock, selection of broodstock candidates bearing native marker alleles and hatchery-based augmentation have been practiced over a 20-year period. We evaluated the success of the marker-assisted selection and hatchery-based augmentation program. Marker-assisted selection of native New River walleye began with mean frequencies of marker alleles at microsatellite loci Svi17 and Svi33 of similar to 30%, and continuing selection has driven marker allele frequencies to similar to 65-70%. Numbers of walleye collected in fall gillnet and spring electrofishing surveys were responsive to augmentations with hatchery fish 2-3 years earlier. Stocking was not practiced in 2012-2013, and a decrease in walleye catch rates was noted in 2016, suggesting that the native New River walleye population still depends upon hatchery-based augmentation. We recommend the development of a small panel of single nucleotide polymorphism markers for more rigorous selection of broodstock representative of the native walleye population.																				2410-3888				MAR 6	2025	10	3							118	10.3390/fishes10030118	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fishes10030118													WOS:001452801800001
J	Rother, A; Köhler, J				Rother, A; Köhler, J			Formation, transport and retention of aggregates in a river-lake system (Spree, Germany)	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												The formation, particle size distribution, structure and retention of aggregates were studied in a river-lake system of the lowland River Spree and factors influencing these processes were evaluated. Samples were taken from the inflow and outflow of a flushed lake, as well as along the adjacent flowing reach of the River Spree, between April 2001 and May 2002. The aim was to record the influence of the seasons and different turbulence intensities on the size, shape, composition, abundance and transport properties of the particles. As additional parameters, the phytoplankton biomass, the concentration of suspended particulate matter, the concentrations of nutrients and the discharge were measured. The abundance of the particles showed a strong seasonality in the investigated period, which closely correlated with the concentrations of suspended particulate matter and particulate organic matter in the water column. The organic carbon content of the suspended matter varied between 37% (dry weight) in summer and about 14% in winter. The concentration of particles ranged between 500 and 2500 particles/ml. The number of particles was significantly lower upstream from the lake than at the downstream transects. The majority of the aggregates in the River Spree were smaller than 500 mu m, most of the particles even showing a diameter less than 50 mu m. Many particles, above all algae, were washed out of the lake Neuendorfer See into the adjacent flowing reach of the River Spree. Algae influenced the abundance of the particles and contributed to the formation of aggregates with their stickiness. In the river flowing section large particles were formed by turbulence structures, whilst simultaneously the number of smaller particles decreased in the water column caused by aggregation processes. In general, an increasing flow velocity and discharge rate resulted in a larger amount of aggregates in the water column. On the other hand, particle abundance was reduced in the flow direction when the flow velocity was low. Under these conditions particles were retained by sedimentation and benthic filter-feeding.

A case study	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Conference on Trophic Cascades in Shallow Freshwater and Brackish Lakes	AUG 20-25, 1995	WARSAW, POLAND	Inst Ecol, Polish Acad Sci, Univ Warsaw, Polish Hydrobiol Soc				A whole-lake experiment was carried out for seven years (1988-1994) in a shallow, eutrophic lake. In the first phase (1989-1991), repeated introductions of young-of-the-year pike (Esox lucius) were used to control the density of juvenile stages of the dominant planktivores (roach Rutilus rutilus, white bream Blicca bjoerkna and Leucaspius delineatus). The successive introductions of juvenile pike were accompanied by selective removal of large pike, roach, bream Abramis brama and white bream. No visible improvement in water quality was registered in the first three years. Assessments made after the lake was treated with rotenone, revealed the high efficiency of juvenile pike in controlling prey of vulnerable size. Though the first three age-classes were nearly exterminated, older fish (3+ to 6+) remained abundant enough to keep their planktonic prey in check. Indeed, the non-altered density of dominant cladocerans indicated that they were still heavily preyed upon. Algal biomass remained high. In October 1991, rotenone was applied to remove all fish. Immigrating fish were gradually recolonizing the lake from spring 1992 onwards. However, the process was kept under control by continued stocking with juvenile pike and intensive fishing. The years following the rotenone treatment witnessed a considerable improvement in water quality, with water transparency 30% higher, a significant 2.2-fold decrease in seston dry weight and 2.8-fold decrease in algal biomass, averaged for the summer months. These events can largely be attributed to substantial changes in the herbivorous zooplankton, above all increased density of Lake Wirbel's largest cladoceran, Daphnia cucullata.					; Pijanowska, Joanna/ACQ-0167-2022	Pijanowska, Joanna/0000-0001-5166-5748; Hliwa, Piotr/0000-0001-5205-608X													0018-8158					JAN 17	1997	342						383	386		10.1023/A:1017047625303	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017047625303													WOS:A1997WZ13900041
J	Pyrovetsi, M				Pyrovetsi, M			Integrated management to create new breeding habitat for dalmatian pelicans (Pelecanus crispus) in Greece	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												An integrated management plan to create favorable nesting habitat for the world-endangered Dalmatian pelicans, was tested at Kerkini irrigation reservoir, a Ramsar wetland. The lake is the major wintering site of Dalmatian pelicans in Europe, where the species lives year-round without breeding. The rise of water level at the reservoir during spring (exceeding 5 m) has an impact on the whole system, including several birds, which lose their nesting habitat. Although the integrity oi the wetland demands ecological restoration with changes in its hydrologic regime, local socioeconomic conditions allow only habitat level interventions. During the planning phase of the management plan, both the ecological and social context of the interventions were considered. Monitoring of all pelican habitats and populations provided the scientific basis, while a socioecological survey on knowledge/attitudes of local fishermen toward wetland identified conflicts with specific resources and planned management. To gain public support, a broad information/education program was implemented. The education program for fishermen was based on the findings of the socioecological survey. The in situ management involved experimental construction of floating rafts, platforms over water, dredged-spoil islands, and platforms at various sites of the wetland. Monitoring of the managed habitats showed that most waterbirds used them for resting and roosting. Common terns nested on the rafts, cormorants on the platforms, and Dalmatian pelicans on the man-made island. Under the prevailing hydrologic and weather conditions, islands seem to be the most suitable habitat for pelican nesting. It is concluded that wildlife habitat management should integrate the ecological component, related to the needs of the species and ecosystem, with the social one, expressed by cooperation and involvement of the local community.																			0364-152X					SEP-OCT	1997	21	5					657	667		10.1007/s002679900058	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002679900058								9236282					WOS:A1997XQ07900002

Macrophytes that take nutrients up for their growth also shelter sediments from resuspension that brings nutrients back to the water and affect denitrification, which removes nitrogen from the water ecosystem. In this study the changes in nutrient concentrations were observed during the open-water period from April to November, and also denitrification rates were measured at different phases of the open-water season. The study was conducted at a shallow eutrophic lake where the effect of macrophytes on water quality is remarkable. The concentration changes of different nitrogen forms during the summer were very similar at the open-water and floating-leaved macrophyte (Nuphar lutea L.) stations. Nitrate was depleted faster among the submerged macrophytes (Myriophyllum verticillatum L.) than among floating-leaved plants or in open water. The decrease in the concentration of nitrate was so significant during the summer that it also affected the total nitrogen concentration in the water. Denitrification was highest in sediments among floating-leaved macrophytes (average 4.3 mg N m(-2) d(-1)) and lowest in sediments of submerged plants (average 1.5 mg N m(-2) d(-1)). Denitrification among submerged macrophytes was limited by low nitrate availability.

The impacts can be short-lived, including changes in water temperature and stratification, but long-lasting effects on the lake's biology may also occur. In this study we used automated water quality monitoring (AWQM) data from 8 boreal lakes to examine how the episodic weather-induced mixing events influenced thermal structure, hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen (DO), fluorometric chlorophyll estimates (Chl-a), and lake metabolism and how these events varied in frequency and magnitude in lakes with different characteristics. Rise in wind speed alone had an effect on the lakes with the weakest thermal stability, but a decrease in air temperature together with strong wind induced mixing events in all lakes. The return period of these mixing events varied widely (from 20 to 92 d) and was dependent on the magnitude of change in weather. In lakes with strong stability, thermal structure and hypolimnetic DO concentration were only slightly affected. Weather-induced mixing in the upper water column diluted the surface water Chl-a repeatedly, whereas seasonal maximum occurred in late summer on each lake. Although Finnish lakes have been characterized with stable stratification during summer, we observed many substantial mixing events of relatively short return periods relevant to both chemical and biological properties of the lakes.

J	Wright, A; Gooseff, M; Bergstrom, A; Welch, K				Wright, Anna; Gooseff, Michael; Bergstrom, Anna; Welch, Kathleen			The hydrologic and geochemical contributions from snow to streamflow in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The glacial meltwater streams in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs), Antarctica only flow during the austral summer and contain abundant algal mats which grow at the onset of flow. Their relative abundance in stream channels of this polar desert make the streams biogeochemical hot spots. The MDVs receive minimal precipitation as snow, which is redistributed by wind and deposited in distinct locations, some of which become persistent snow patches each year. Previous studies identified that MDV streamflow comes from a combination of glacier ice and snow, although snow was assumed to contribute little to the overall water budget. This study uses a combination of satellite imagery, terrain analysis, and field measurements to determine where snow patches accumulate and persist across MDV watersheds, and to quantify the potential hydrologic and biogeochemical contributions of snow patches to streams. Watersheds near the coast have the highest snow-covered area and longest snow persistence. Many of these snow patches accumulate within the stream channels, which results in the potential to contribute to streamflow. During the summer of 2021-2022, stream channel snow patches had the potential to contribute anywhere between <1% and 90% of the total annual discharge in Lake Fryxell Basin streams, and may increase with different hydrometeorological conditions. On average the potential inputs from snow patches to streamflow was between 12% and 25% of the annual discharge during the 2021-2022 season, as determined by snow area and SWE. Snow patches in the majority of the watersheds had higher nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations than stream water, and six streams contained snow with higher N:P ratios than the average N:P in the stream water. This suggests that if such patches melt early in the summer, these nutrient and water inputs could occur at the right time and stoichiometry to be crucial for early season algal mat growth.					; Gooseff, Michael/N-6087-2015	Wright, Anna/0009-0003-4709-151X; Gooseff, Michael/0000-0003-4322-8315													0885-6087	1099-1085				JUN	2024	38	6							e15195	10.1002/hyp.15195	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.15195													WOS:001236994500001

Genetic divergence across a low-head dam: A preliminary analysis using logperch and greenside darters	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH					Conference of the North-Central Section Meeting of the Geological-Society-of-America	APR 20, 2006	Univ Akron, Akron, OH	Geol Soc Amer	Univ Akron			Dams have been built on waterways for centuries, acting as barriers to fish migration and possible impediments to gene flow. We tested whether the Munroe Falls low-head dam, constructed in 1817 on the middle Cuyahoga River in the northeast Ohio portion of the Lake Erie watershed, formed a barrier for fish migration. Subsequent to our sampling, the dam was removed in fall 2005. The present study characterized the population genetic composition of two species of darters (Family Percidae), Etheostoma blennioides (greenside darter) and Percina caprodes (logperch darter), upstream and downstream from the dam in comparison with an outlying population from the Grand River, Ohio using mitochondrial DNA control region and cytochrome b gene sequences. Results found a single genotype in the greenside darter samples that was shared upstream and downstream from the dam, and thus no evidence for effect of the dam could be discerned. In contrast, samples of logperch darter differed in genotypic frequencies above and below the dam, with unique alleles occurring below the dam. It thus is possible that the Munroe Falls low-head dam acted as a one-way barrier to gene flow for logperch. Further genetic studies should test for possible after-effects of the dam removal on these darter populations, and relate these data to variation along and among river systems, including other potential barriers to gene flow.

J	Huang, C; Wei, GJ; Li, WX; Liu, Y				Huang, Chao; Wei, Gangjian; Li, Wuxian; Liu, Ying			A geochemical record of the link between chemical weathering and the East Asian summer monsoon during the late Holocene preserved in lacustrine sediments from Poyang Lake, central China	JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES												This paper presents relatively high-resolution geochemical records spanning the past 4000 cal yr BP obtained from the lacustrine sediments of Poyang Lake in central China. The variations in the intensity of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) are traced using the K/Na, Ti/Na, Al/K, kaolinite/illite and clay/feldspar ratios, together with the chemical index of alteration (CIA), as indicators of chemical weathering. During the last 4000 years, the proxy records of chemical weathering from Poyang Lake exhibit an overall enhanced trend, consistent with regional hydrological changes in previous independent records. Further comparisons and analyses demonstrate that regional moisture variations in central China is inversely correlated with the EASM intensity, with weak EASM generating high precipitation in central China. Our data reveal three intervals of dramatically dry climatic conditions (i.e., ca. 4000-3200 cal yr BP, ca. 2800-2400 cal yr BP, and ca. 500-200 cal yr BP). A period of weak chemical weathering, related to cold and dry climatic conditions, occurred during the Little Ice Age (LIA), whereas more intense chemical weathering, reflecting warm and humid climatic conditions, was recorded during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP). Besides, an intensification of chemical weathering in Poyang Lake during the late Holocene agrees well with strong ENSO activity, suggesting that moisture variations in central China may be predominantly driven by ENSO variability.					; wei, gangjian/F-6513-2013; Huang, Chao/KXR-5743-2024; Li, Wuxian/A-6302-2009	Wei, Gangjian/0000-0002-9620-0087; 													1367-9120	1878-5786				APR 1	2018	154						17	25		10.1016/j.jseaes.2017.12.008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jseaes.2017.12.008													WOS:000425202000003

Seasonal mixing, which varies in intensity from year to year, in fl uences the top 65 m. Below, the lake is permanently stratified, with density increasing stepwise from 998 kg m-3 at the surface to 1,002 kg m(-3) at the maximum depth of 485 m. The permanently strati fi ed deep water is divided into two distinctly different zones by a main gradient layer. This gradient is maintained by a strong in fl ow of relatively fresh and cool water entering at 250 m depth which is the most important of several subaquatic springs affecting the density strati fi cation. The springs drive a slow upwelling of the whole water column with a depth-dependent rate of 0.15- 0.9 m year(-1). This upwelling is the main driver of internal nutrient recycling and upward transport of dissolved gases. Diffusive transport in the deep water is dominated by double-diffusive convection, which manifests in a spectacular staircase of more than 300 steps and mixed layers. Double diffusion allows heat to be removed from the deep zone faster than dissolved substances, supporting the stable strati fi cation and the accumulation of nutrients and gases over hundreds of years. The strati fi cation in the lake seems to be near steady- state conditions, except for a warming trend of 0.01 degrees C year(-1)					Schmid, Martin/C-3953-2009; Wuest, Alfred/L-2607-2014	Schmid, Martin/0000-0001-8699-5691; 													1573-4595	2543-005X	978-94-007-4243-7; 978-94-007-4242-0				2012	5						13	29		10.1007/978-94-007-4243-7_2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-4243-7_2	10.1007/978-94-007-4243-7												WOS:000459770800011

Transplants were raised in nurseries in Wisconsin and Ontario, and planted in 1969 in an open field after thorough weed control. Observations in the Wisconsin nursery, and in the field between 1971 and 1979 are reported. They included heights, frost damage, spring vegetative growth phenotype, strobili production and 3 cone characteristics. The discussion concentrates on the relationships between heights and the other measured characteristics. Frost damage proved difficult to assess. In the year of frost, damage is severe, a 50% growth reduction, and the fastest growing trees are most severely damaged. However, in environments with only occasional late spring frosts, permanent damage is negligible. Spring growth initiation was not correlated significantly with total height growth or frost damage. Breeding of late-flushing genotypes that can avoid frost damage is questionable in spite of the high heritability for flushing. Female strobili production was substantial at age 10 yr, male production was not. Even so, generation turnovers of 10-15 yr may be possible. The impact of fecundity on growth potential is discussed as it relates to multigeneration breeding.																			0045-5067	1208-6037					1985	15	3					498	504		10.1139/x85-082	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x85-082													WOS:A1985AJC8100005

The sabkha and deep-sea dolomite are detrital and recycled from Cretaceous bedrock. The dolomite in sea-marginal ponds owes its origin to salinity-elevated seawaters and is an evaporite mineral.

J	Essex, HE; Markowitz, J; Mann, FC				Essex, HE; Markowitz, J; Mann, FC			The physiologic action of the venom of the honeybee (Apis mellifera)	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY												The venom of 6 bees intravenously injected into an etherized dog, weighing 4.5 kgm., caused, after a latent period of 12 sec., a sharp rise and a rapid and profound fall of blood-pressure; the venom of 4 bees injected into an etherized rabbit weighing 2-6 kgm., after a 10-sec. latent period, caused a rapid fall of blood-pressure, returning to normal in 4 min. Intravenous injection of the venom from 10 bees into a dog weighing 6.8 kgm. caused a precipitate fall in blood-pressure and in kidney volume, both returning to normal in 1 hr. That splanchnic dilatation is not the cause of the immediate fall in blood pressure is indicated by the fact that the venom from 10 bees, injected into a dog weighing 10 kgm., produced immediate increase in the volume of the hind limb. Maximal contraction occurred in the perfused uterus of a virgin guinea pig on addition of the venom of 1 bee to the perfusing solution. The intravenous injection of a venom from 4 bees into a large guinea pig caused occlusive bronchospasm. A perfused rabbit heart was rapidly incapacitated when the venom from 8 bees was added to the perfusing solution. In general, the venom of the bee may be described as a violent endothelial poison and a marked stimulant of smooth muscle; it is comparable in these respects to . histamine. In view of the fact that the perfused mammalian heart is promptly incapacitated by this substance and erythrocytes are quickly laked, it would be preferable to designate the venom as a general protoplasmic poison, as has been done for the venom of rattlesnakes.																			0002-9513					JUL	1930	94	1					209	214		10.1152/ajplegacy.1930.94.1.209	http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajplegacy.1930.94.1.209													WOS:000202425900026

The 2019 project was the 1.8 net sculpture by American sculpture and fiber artist Janet Echelman, previously displayed in London, U.K. (2016), San Diego, CA (2016), Mexico City, Mexico (2017), Beijing, China (2017), and Xian, China (2018). Spanning 145 ft by 115 ft, the 1.8 net sculpture was suspended 50 to 60 ft above the town lake. Due to the temporary nature of the structure, its helical pier foundations, stage towers, short timelines for both design and construction, precarious location, and precise artistic requirements, this project required a unique geotechnical and structural acumen to address the construction challenges. Cranes, kayaks, stand up paddle boards, lifts, and a party barge retrofitted into a helical pier drill rig were all necessary to complete the project. Extensive coordination between the engineering design team, construction manager, project manager, foundation contractor, tower designer, tower manufacturer, net installation/lighting crew, and Echelman's representative resulted in a successful showcasing of the dynamic net sculpture in Green Mountain Falls from July 4 to September 2, 2019.																					978-0-7844-8326-8				2021	13						195	209																WOS:000692150400014

Solubility of iron(III) is very low in neutral pH, but some organic compounds serve as dictators with iron(III) to form dissolved stable complexes. In Lake Biwa, Japan, dissolved iron concentration is very high (mean 84 nmol L-1, median 28 nmol L-1 in the north basin; MITO et al. 2004). However, when taking into account iron complexation, the labile iron concentration is very low and may serve as a co-limiting factor of primary production, as seen in the eutrophic Lake Kasumigaura, Japan (NAGAI et al. 2006). Iron(l I) is a minor component in oxic circumneutral freshwater because it is immediately oxidized to iron(111) species., It has high potential bioavailability for primary production, however, because of its high solubility and low complexation compared with iron(111) that sometimes form a stable organic complex unavailable to phytoplankton (IMAI et al. 1999). According to SWAN et al. (1998), iron(11) exists in the epilimnion of the oxic freshwater Lake Kinneret in the order of tens of nmol L-1. While iron(ii) is oxidized by O-2, O-2 center dot(-) and H2O2 in water, colored dissolved organic matter (C:DOM), such as humic substances, serves as a mediator of photoreduction of iron(III) to iron(II) at the lake surface (EMMENEGGER et al. 2001). We analyzed the vertical profiles of iron(11) in summer and autumn in Lake Biwa. Because the concentration of iron(II) is estimated to be low, solid phase extraction of iron(II)-ferrozine complex was investigated using a modified method of YI et al. (1992). To verify the photoreductive formation of iron(II) at the lake surface, the water of Lake Biwa was irradiated by sunlight.

J	Jones, B; Renaut, RW; Rosen, MR				Jones, B; Renaut, RW; Rosen, MR			Stromatolites forming in acidic hot-spring waters, North Island, New Zealand	PALAIOS												Small spicular, columnar, and blade-shaped stromatolites are common features of hot spring and geyser systems in the Taupo Volcanic Zone of North Island, New Zealand. These organosedimentary structures can grow in many settings, where coater temperature and pH vary widely. Although most common in neutral and alkaline waters, stromatolites also are forming in several acid-sulfate spring and geyser systems in the Waiotapu geothermal area and at Lake Rotokawa. Growth of these stromatolites is partly mediated by a biota that is dominated by fungi and locally, diatoms. When stromatolites from acidic thermal waters are compared with those from neutral and alkali waters, significant differences in, their biota and mineralogy are evident. The biota in stromatolites from the neutral and alkali waters is dominated by prokaryotic bacteria (including cyanobacteria), whereas stromatolites from acidic waters are dominated by eukaryotic fungi and to a lesser extent, diatoms. Stromatolites in the neutral and alkali thermal waters are formed almost entirely of opaline silica, with calcite laminae present in a few localities. Although stromatolites in the acidic systems also are composed mainly of opaline silica, they contain substantial amounts of kaolinite and, locally, sulfur and/or jarosite. In ancient thermal deposits it may be possible to distinguish stromatolites that grew in acidic waters from those that formed in neutral and alkali systems by considering their preserved biota and mineralogy.					; Rosen, Michael/D-6091-2015	Rosen, Michael/0000-0003-3991-0522; Jones, Brian/0000-0003-3088-5543													0883-1351	1938-5323				OCT	2000	15	5					450	475		10.2307/3515515	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3515515													WOS:000089771300007
J	Zalewski, M				Zalewski, M			Do smaller islands host younger populations? A case study on metapopulations of three carabid species	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aims To test a new concept for island ecology and metapopulation studies: if population persistence is a result of colonization and extinction processes, one would expect remarkable variability in the age of neighbouring populations - there would be both old and young (recently established) populations. Location The lake Mamry archipelago, Poland. Methods Forty trap transects with a total of 114 Barber traps were operating from June to September in 1997 and in 1998. The traps (0.5-L plastic beakers, mouth diameter 120 mm, with a 20 x 20 cm wooden roof) were placed by applying a stratified sampling design into 13 habitat types on the 16 islands and two mainland sites. The frequency of macropterous individuals in wing-dimorphic populations of three carabid species (Pterostichus melanarius, P. anthracinus and Carabus granulatus) was used as an indicator of population 'age'. Results The frequency of macropterous individuals in the populations varied from 0% to 100% for P. melanarius (18.5% on average), from 0% to 91% for P. anthracinus (12.6%) and from 0% to 29% for C. granulatus (8.9%). Populations hosted more long-winged individuals (and were therefore interpreted as being younger) on smaller islands, compared with those inhabiting large islands and the mainland sites. The results also revealed that the viability of the populations of the autumn-breeding P. melanarius might be more affected by population size than that of the two studied spring breeders. Island connectivity did not have a significant effect on the frequency of macropterous individuals in the studied populations. Main conclusions The inverse relationship between the proportion of macropterous individuals and island size contrasts with the accepted theory of dispersal, which assumes that there is selection against dispersal on small islands. A regression analysis for population age and habitat characteristics reveals the extinction probability of a given population. I suggest that investigations based on variability in population age can help in studies of colonization-extinction processes that would otherwise face logistic and methodological obstacles.																			0305-0270	1365-2699				JUL	2004	31	7					1139	1148		10.1111/j.1365-2699.2004.01097.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2004.01097.x													WOS:000221906700009
J	Campbell, LS; Steenburgh, WJ				Campbell, Leah S.; Steenburgh, W. James			The OWLeS IOP2b Lake-Effect Snowstorm: Mechanisms Contributing to the Tug Hill Precipitation Maximum	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Lake-effect storms frequently produce a pronounced precipitation maximum over the Tug Hill Plateau (hereafter Tug Hill), which rises 500 m above Lake Ontario's eastern shore. Here Weather Research and Forecasting Model simulations are used to examine the mechanisms responsible for the Tug Hill precipitation maximum observed during IOP2b of the Ontario Winter Lake-effect Systems (OWLeS) field program. A key contributor was a land-breeze front that formed along Lake Ontario's southeastern shoreline and extended inland and northeastward across Tug Hill, cutting obliquely across the lake-effect system. Localized ascent along this boundary contributed to an inland precipitation maximum even in simulations in which Tug Hill was removed. The presence of Tug Hill intensified and broadened the ascent region, increasing parameterized depositional and accretional hydrometeor growth, and reducing sublimational losses. The inland extension of the land-breeze front and its contribution to precipitation enhancement appear to be unidentified previously and may be important in other lake-effect storms over Tug Hill.

Content of HCH and DDT was tested according to the method of Amarowicz et. al. Apiary A was situated on the edge of a mixed forest near a lake, apiary B was surrounded by a pine forest, and the nectar was collected from weeds and forest vegetation. Apiaries C and D were located on the grounds of large farms; bees from these apiaries flew round white mustard, plants on wastelands and wayside ditches. Apiary E was surrounded with sandy fields, where buckwheat was cultivated and weeds grew on wastelands. gamma-HCH and DDT residues were found in all samples of foraging bees and those from the winter scatter. The greatest amount of gamma-HCH was detected in foragers from apiary A (0.0152 mug/g l.m.) and E (0.0142 mug/g l.m.), and DDT in bees from E (0.0288 mug/g l.m. - bees from scatter and 0.0110 mug/g l.m. - foraging bees). The analysis of the results demonstrated that differences in chlorinated hydrocarbon content between foraging bees and bees from scatter depended on apiary location. For example, in A gamma-HCH content was:2.62 and DDT 1.84 times lower in bees from scatter than from foragers, while in apiary B the difference between bees from winter scatter and foragers in gamma-HCH content was over 1.5 and DDT almost 3.4 times lower. Considerably larger differences in gamma-HCH and DDT content of foraging bees and those from the scatter were found in apiary C and D (2.48-3.29 times less for HCH and 2.02-4.05 time less for DDT). In apiary E only the decrease of HCH content by 1.52 times in bees from the winter scatter and over a twofold increase of DDT were ascertained. The results of the investigations, as well as those obtained earlier by Romaniuk and all in Warmia and Mazuria [2, 5, 6] allow for the claim that higher quantities of chlorinated hydrocarbons appear in foraging bees from apiaries situated in a region where earlier chlorinated hydrocarbons, especially DDT, were used in large amounts.																			0025-8628					JAN	2005	61	1					103	105																WOS:000226058000026

Examination of radial growth indices for sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh. trees suggested that reductions in growth coincided with low volumetric soil water contents and with low NO3- concentrations in soil solution. The lowest mean monthly NO3- concentrations in soil percolate were observed during severe summer droughts. Nitrate concentrations were negatively correlated (r2 = -0.803) with SO42- levels in solution and positively correlated (r2 = 0.761) with Ca2+ levels. Nitrification, by stimulating adsorption Of SO42- by the soil, may lead to temporary retention of atmospheric SO42- in soils that otherwise exhibit only limited capacity to retain SO42-. If warmer, drier summers become more frequent, nitrogen cycling will become more closed as the supply of nitrogen to the vegetation and leaching of nitrogen from the soil are reduced. Sulfate-moderated leaching from the soil, however, will increase; hence, net cation leaching is unlikely to change in response to drier summers.

Community-Level Waterbird Responses to Water Hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes)	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												Water hyacinth is among the most widespread invasive plants worldwide; however, its effects on waterbirds are largely undocumented. We monitored site use by waterbirds at Lake Chapala, the largest lake in Mexico and recently designated Ramsar site, to evaluate the potential influence of water hyacinth cover on species composition and aggregate measures of the waterbird community, including waterbird density, species richness, and Simpson's index of diversity. We examined the response of waterbirds to changes in percent water hyacinth cover at 22 independent sites around the lake during six study seasons from May 2006 to February 2008. We found little evidence to suggest that percent water hyacinth cover affected aggregate community measures; however, multivariate analysis of relative species composition suggested that water hyacinth cover corresponded with seasonal species composition (Canonical Correspondence r = 0.66, P = 0.007) when seasonal site cover averaged 17.7 +/- 4.67% (winter 2007). Several migratory species were not observed during this season, which could suggest that some small-bodied migratory species avoided Lake Chapala during the winter of high water hyacinth cover. We suspect that observed changes in the waterbird community are in response to species-specific tolerances for water hyacinth and indirect abiotic and biotic effects of its presence (e.g., invertebrate and fish composition).

J	Coghlan, SM; Ringler, NH				Coghlan, SM; Ringler, NH			Comparison of Atlantic salmon embryo and fry stocking in the salmon river, New York	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												To assess the feasibility of restoring an extirpated species, it is crucial to identify the method of reintroduction that optimizes juvenile survival and growth so that adequate adult populations inay be established. Because Atlantic salmon Salmo salar fry are relatively expensive to rear, we compared the efficacies of two embryo-stocking methods and one fry-stocking method in producing age-0 Atlantic salmon parr in the Salmon River, New York. As measured by resulting part- densities, there were no differences in survival rates between embryos stocked with and without protective hatching boxes; the mean Survival of embryo-stocked fish to late summer was less than 0.01 %. Fry stocking produced significantly greater densities of late-summer parr than did embryo stocking, with site-specific Survival ranging Lip to 8%; the mean survival of fry was 2%. Considering the hatchery costs of rearing each life stage, the labor involved in stocking, and the resulting late-summer parr abundances, we recommend planting fry rather than embryos as a method of reintroducing Atlantic salmon. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the success of stocking older life stages of Atlantic salmon in the Salmon River, although factors other than juvenile survival are probably important in establishing and maintaining a spawning Population.																			0275-5947					NOV	2004	24	4					1385	1397		10.1577/M03-253.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M03-253.1													WOS:000226080800026

We tested if surface ice influenced the behavior (swimming activity, aggressive encounters, and number of food items eaten) and stress level (coloration of eyes and body) of stream-living brown trout Salmo trutta at temperatures of 3-4 degrees C in indoor experimental flumes. We hypothesized that an individual's resting metabolic rate (RMR, as measured by resting ventilation rate) would affect winter behavior. Therefore, groups of 4 trout, consisting of individuals with high, low, or mixed (2 individuals each) RMR, were exposed to experimental conditions with or without ice cover. Ice cover reduced stress responses, as evaluated by body coloration. Also, trout in low RMR groups had a paler body color than those in both mixed and high RMR groups. Trout increased their swimming activity under ice cover, with the highest activity found in high RMR groups. Ice cover increased the number of aggressive encounters but did not influence the number of drifting food items taken by each group. In mixed RMR groups, however, single individuals were better able to monopolize food than in the other groups. As the presence of surface ice increases the activity level and reduces stress in stream-living trout, ice cover should influence their energy budgets and production. The results should be viewed in light of ongoing global warming that reduces the duration of ice cover, especially at high latitudes and altitudes.

New Emphasis on Water Transparency as Socio-Ecological Indicator for Urban Water: Bridging Ecosystem Service Supply and Sustainable Ecosystem Health	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												The perspective on water transparency changed since the early days of limnology from being a physical parameter of optical water property to an ecological indicator tracking algal turbidity due to eutrophication or an overall success of sustained lake restoration in the late 60ies to 80ies. In modern cities, where ecosystems are commonly deteriorated by man-made modifications, water transparency offers a great opportunity to the public to raise socio-ecological consciousness concerning urban green-blue spaces. We thus re-emphasize water transparency as a key indicator of multi-functional value when assessing an oxbow lake of the riverine floodplain in Vienna, the Alte Donau. Our study covers the eutrophication from 1987 to 1994 due to the inclusion of the riverine landscape in the urban area, the following lake restoration with an ecosystem shift from a nutrient-rich, algal-turbid water body to a nutrient-poor, clear-water macrophyte controlled system and the impact of global warming in recent decades. We used light attenuation profiles to identify depth layers of specific ambient light requirements for photosynthetic domains (phytoplankton and submerged macrophytes), and to interpret Secchi measurements. Here, we calculated the depth at 1% (minimum light requirements for phytoplankton growth as euphotic depth), 3% (minimum light requirements for macrophytes as maximum macrophyte colonization depth), and 12% (preferred light requirements for phytoplankton development) of surface ambient light. A Secchi disk water transparency of 1.5 m ("lake bottom view"), judged as good water quality by human perception, refers to mesotrophic conditions with a maximum colonization depth for macrophytes exceeding the mean lake depth in Alte Donau. Water clarity required for sustained macrophyte growth, in particular for favoring bottom-dwellingCharameadows instead of tall-growingMyriophyllum spicatum, is 3.5 m Secchi depth and thus exceeds by far water clarity requested due to bathing aesthetics. Global warming, mirrored by an advanced warming in spring seems to favor significantly a higher yield of macrophytes mainly built up byMyriophyllumat the expense of the yield of algae. The prolongation of the summer period above 21 degrees C, however, coincides with lowered Secchi transparency. Water visibility during the hot season thus seems to be slightly hampered against lake restoration efforts by global warming.

Summer CO2 evasion from streams and rivers in the Kolyma River basin, north-east Siberia	POLAR RESEARCH												Inland water systems are generally supersaturated in carbon dioxide (CO2) and are increasingly recognized as playing an important role in the global carbon cycle. The Arctic may be particularly important in this respect, given the abundance of inland waters and carbon contained in Arctic soils; however, a lack of trace gas measurements from small streams in the Arctic currently limits this understanding. We investigated the spatial variability of CO2 evasion during the summer low-flow period from streams and rivers in the northern portion of the Kolyma River basin in north-eastern Siberia. To this end, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) and gas exchange velocities (k) were measured at a diverse set of streams and rivers to calculate CO2 evasion fluxes. We combined these CO2 evasion estimates with satellite remote sensing and geographic information system techniques to calculate total areal CO2 emissions. Our results show that small streams are substantial sources of atmospheric CO2 owing to high pCO(2) and k, despite being a small portion of total inland water surface area. In contrast, large rivers were generally near equilibrium with atmospheric CO2. Extrapolating our findings across the Panteleikha - Ambolikha sub-watersheds demonstrated that small streams play a major role in CO2 evasion, accounting for 86% of the total summer CO2 emissions from inland waters within these two sub-watersheds. Further expansion of these regional CO2 emission estimates across time and space will be critical to accurately quantify and understand the role of Arctic streams and rivers in the global carbon budget.					; Mann, Paul/H-7268-2014	Holmes, Robert Max/0000-0002-6413-9154; Mann, Paul/0000-0002-6221-3533													0800-0395	1751-8369					2013	32								19704	10.3402/polar.v32i0.19704	http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/polar.v32i0.19704													WOS:000328488200001

TRANSFER OF COCHLIOPA TEXANA TO PYRGULOPSIS (HYDROBIIDAE) AND DESCRIPTION OF A THIRD CONGENER FROM THE LOWER PECOS RIVER BASIN	JOURNAL OF MOLLUSCAN STUDIES												The Phantom Cave snail (Cochliopa texana), a little-studied rissooidean gastropod that is locally endemic within the lower Pecos River basin (Texas) and currently a candidate for addition to the Federal list of threatened and endangered species, is redescribed and transferred to the hydrobiid genus Pyrgulopsis, based on shell and anatomical characters. Specimens from the type locality (Phantom Lake Spring) and San Solomon Spring are larger than those from East Sandia Spring and also differ somewhat in shell shape and shape of the central cusps of the lateral radular teeth. However genetic (mtCOI, NDI) variation within and among these geographically proximal (613 km) populations was slight, providing no basis for the recognition of distinct conservation units of this imperiled species. We also describe Pyrgulopsis ignota n. sp., which was recently discovered in a different part of the lower Pecos River basin and initially confused with the Phantom Cave snail. These two species differ in shell shape, operculum morphology, and form and glandular ornament of the penis. They are also strongly differentiated genetically from each other and from (13) other regional congeners (pairwise sequence divergence.6.3% for both genes). A Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of the COI and NDI dataset indicated that these two snails are not closely related and that P. ignota occupies a basal position relative to other regional congeners.																			0260-1230	1464-3766				AUG	2010	76		3				245	256		10.1093/mollus/eyq002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mollus/eyq002													WOS:000280317500004

The two major water inputs, the upper St. Lawrence River, which drains waters originating from the Lake Ontario, and the Ottawa River were collected fortnightly over 18 months. In addition, other tributaries were sampled during the spring floods. The output was monitored near Quebec City at the river mouth weekly between 1995 and 1999. Dissolved metal concentrations in the upper St. Lawrence River carbonated waters were lower than in the acidic waters of the tributaries draining the crystalline rocks of the Canadian shield and the forest cover. Biogeochemical and hydrodynamic processes occurring in Lake Ontario drive the seasonal variations observed in the upper St. Lawrence River. Biogeochemical processes relate to biological uptake, regeneration of organic matter (for Cd and Zn) and oxyhydroxide formation (for Mn and Fe), while hydrodynamic processes mainly concern the seasonal change in vertical stratification (for Cd, Mn, and Zn). In the Ottawa River, the main tributary, oxyhydroxide formation in summer governs seasonal patterns of Al, Fe, Mn, Cd, Co and Zn. The downstream section of the St. Lawrence River is a transit zone in which seasonal variations are mainly driven by the mixing of the different water masses and the large input of suspended particulate matter from erosion. The budget of all dissolved elements, except Fe and Zn, was balanced, as the budget of particulate elements (except Cd and Zn). The main sources of metals to the St. Lawrence River are erosion and inputs from tributaries and Lake Ontario. Direct anthropogenic discharges into the river accounted for less than 5% of the load, except for Cd (10%) and Zn (21%). The fluxes in transfer of dissolved Cd, Co, Cu and Zn species from the river to the lower St. Lawrence estuary were equal to corresponding fluxes calculated for Quebec City since the distributions of dissolved concentrations of these metals versus salinity were conservative. For Fe, the curvature of the dilution line obtained suggests that dissolved species were removed during early mixing.. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

During winter, differential vertical mixing due to non-uniform wind exposure and different total dissolved solid concentrations in the main tributaries of the lake cause considerable interbasin density gradients. These gradients induce density-driven currents across the sills that contribute significantly to the deep water exchange in the basins and gradually reduce the density gradients during summer. Over a period of 2 yr (1990-1992), the spatial and temporal evolution of water density and water age (measured by the H-3-He-3 method) was investigated. Variation in water age between the different basins and the occasional occurrence of age inversions (older water overlying younger one) can be explained in terms of the observed density distribution and the exchange flows the density gradients cause. Water age provides an integral measure of the magnitude of deep-water renewal, which in some basins can be roughly separated into contributions from density-driven currents and wind-induced vertical mixing. By correlating water age with dissolved helium and oxygen concentrations, radiogenic helium fluxes and average oxygen depletion rates were determined for the main basins of the lake. The helium flux was between 1 and 2x10(10) atoms m(-2) s(-1), indicating dynamic equilibrium with helium production in the underlying crust. Oxygen depletion rates per unit sediment area were roughly equal in all basins (between 220 and 290 g m(-2) yr(-1)), whereas volumetric depletion rates varied from 1.8 g m(-3) yr(-1) in the deepest basin to 10 g m(-3) yr(-1) in the shallowest.

They are also excellent natural laboratories because of their stable conditions, reducing the number of variables to be considered in field studies. We examined the composition, dynamics and colonisation patterns of macroinvertebrates with respect to canopy coverage and time of day in which available areas are actively colonised. We used artificial substrates that mimicked the natural habitat structure at an isolated karst spring and recovered exposed substrates every 12 h. Physico-chemical parameters of water did not differ significantly regardless of canopy cover. The most numerous representatives and the pioneering champions were larvae of Baetidae (Ephemeroptera) and Chironomidae (Diptera). Simuliidae were also among the most successful pioneering species. Most observed groups more actively colonised substrates in the closed canopy area. Oligochaeta and Gammarus fossarum were more numerous on substrates in the open canopy area. Individuals of all analysed groups showed day-night migration patterns and were more active at night. Coleoptera (Elmis sp.) were the poorest (re)colonisers among the analysed taxa.

Predicting drivers of nuisance macrophyte cover in a regulated California stream using boosted regression tree models	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												The tremendous cost and difficulty of controlling submersed macrophyte proliferation in regulated waters drives a need for ecologically based strategies to reduce problematic macrophyte growth in the long term. Our study investigated the extent and causes of excessive submersed macrophyte growth in the Interdam Reach of Putah Creek in central California, USA, where plant biomass and propagules clog canal infrastructure downstream. In summer to fall 2011, we surveyed submersed macrophyte cover and environmental factors, including canopy cover, water velocity, depth, sediment nutrients, and substrate texture. Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L.) and western waterweed [Elodea nuttallii (Planch.) St. John] were the most abundant species, and along with five additional species comprised our response variable of nuisance macrophyte cover. Using boosted regression tree models, we identified the abiotic factors most important in predicting nuisance macrophyte cover as those associated with light availability (sun hours and water depth) and flow (water velocity and substrate texture). This machine learning-based modeling approach enabled us to find biologically relevant thresholds in predicted macrophyte cover that would have been difficult or impossible to identify with standard linear models. Overall, increasing canopy shading or water depth beyond threshold values and increasing water velocity to flush out fine sediments (e.g., channel narrowing) are likely to be most effective in sustainably reducing nuisance macrophyte abundance in the Interdam Reach. Because of the cosmopolitan distributions of the most abundant species found in this study, our findings have broader relevance to water managers dealing with problem aquatic vegetation in many other regions.

The stable water isotopic composition of the water samples collected clearly demonstrated that the karstic groundwater in the region was recharged from the local meteorological water. The tritium activity in the samples was found to be in between 3 and 4 TU, falling in the range of the H-3 activity in the local precipitation and thus meaning that the traveling of recharge water to the resurgences was very short. Concentrated and diffuse allogenic recharges seem to be important sources of karstic groundwater in the study region. Water in the karstic aquifers could be classified into three types as: (a) water from karstic areas with dense vegetation cover that causes DIC be depleted in carbon 13 ((13)delta <-12aEuro degrees vs. Pee Dee Belemnite standard of Vienna, VPDB); (b) water from karstic areas with poor vegetation cover that originates DIC with carbon 13 composition ranging from -11 to -12aEuro degrees; and (c) surface water from lakes, springs and rivers that has DIC with enriched carbon 13 (delta C-13 >-10aEuro degrees). This implies that there are several sources of carbon dioxide contributing to the DIC in water of the karstic aquifers in the study region. Among other potential sources, the atmospheric CO2, CO2 from carbonate rock dissolution, biomineralization of soil organic matters and plant roots respiration seem to be important sources of the DIC in the waters of this region. The results show high vulnerability towards anthropogenic contaminants of karstic groundwater in the study region.																			1866-6280	1866-6299				SEP	2013	70	2					521	529		10.1007/s12665-011-0943-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-011-0943-x													WOS:000323737300005

Alewives were abundant in 1976 but a die-off greatly reduced their numbers during the winter of 1976-1977. The population quickly recovered, however, adult abundance increasing nearly sevenfold during 1978-1981. In spring 1981 the bottom population in southern Lake Ontario was estimated to be 5.25 .times. 109 fish weighing 128,500 t. Estimated average alewife biomass per hectare during 1978-1982 far exceeded the estimates for either Lake Michigan during 1967-1982 or western Lake Huron during 1973-1982. Recruitment of age-II fish to the population was affected by abundance of adults in two ways: (1) the number of yearlings produced was directly related to adult abundance at low population levels but inversely related at high population levels; and (2) survival of yearling to age II was inversely related to adult abundance. Growth in 1977 was exceptional, leaving a wide, unmistakable band on scales of the previously slow-growing adults. This wide growth zone served as a marker to identify survivors of the 1976-1977 die-off and to show that each year after 1978 a successive larger proportion of survivors was failing to grow in length or to form an annulus (54% in 1979, 96% in 1980, and 100% in 1981). There was no marker on scales of alewives recruited after the dieoff, but the apparent age composition of our catches strongly suggested that most of them also failed to grow in 1981.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				JAN	1986	115	1					1	14		10.1577/1548-8659(1986)115<1:DOAILO>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1986)115<1:DOAILO>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1986A934200001

Prey capture success of Sandwich Terns Sterna sandvicensis varies non-linearly with water transparency	IBIS												Human impacts on water transparency may affect plunge-diving seabirds. We studied prey capture success of Sandwich Terns Sterna sandvicensis as a function of six environmental variables during the breeding season. We observed diving terns in the south eastern North Sea and found a non-linear optimum curve for the relationship between Secchi transparency and prey capture probability. High capture probability was found at 1.5-2.0 m, with an optimum of 63% at 1.74 m. At a minimum transparency of 0.4 m and at a maximum transparency of 3.2 m, capture probabilities were about halved. Conversion of transparency to total suspended matter (TSM) concentration showed that the optimum concentration for foraging terns would be 5-10 mg/L under mean summer conditions for chlorophyll-a. However, the summer-averaged TSM concentrations in the nearshore Dutch coastal waters range between 10 and 30 mg/L, which implies that foraging Terns in the breeding season do not encounter optimal foraging conditions. The Full Plunge Dive, with which the largest diving depth can be achieved, was applied dominantly in clear water, while the Partial Plunge Dive and Contact Dip were applied more frequently in turbid water, thus showing that Sandwich Terns adjust their diving technique in response to water transparency.

Based on the analysis of primary chemical elements (78 samples) [SiO2, Al2O3, and Fe2O3 + FeO (TOFE)], we found that the variation of the primary chemical element content shows eleven chemical element cycles, of these, seven cycles are approximately consistent with the sedimentary cycles. This study suggests that the peaks of SiO2 contents and the valleys of Al2O3, TOFE, Al2O3/SiO2, TOFE/SiO2, and (TOFE + Al2O3)/SiO2 contents in the dune sands represent the dominant periods of East Asian winter monsoon, the valleys of SiO2 contents and the peaks of Al2O3, TOFE, Al2O3/SiO2, TOFE/SiO2, and (TOFE + Al2O3)/SiO2 contents in the paleosol and loess reflect the dominant periods of East Asian summer monsoon. The cold periods C1, C2, C3, C4, C7, C9, C10, and C11 revealed by primary chemical element contents in the CGS1 correspond well to the cold events in the North Atlantic. We attributed the climate fluctuations to the combination impact of oceans and atmosphere triggered by the weakened AMOC. Furthermore, we found more cold periods such as C5, C6, and C8 in the CGS1 than those in the North Atlantic, which were also discovered in some other places of China. They serve as new evidence in China's deserts to support global climate variations during the Holocene.																			1866-7511	1866-7538				JAN	2016	9	1							51	10.1007/s12517-015-2123-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12517-015-2123-x													WOS:000369322200051

At the c. 48-m-deep and c. 0.5-km2 large proglacial Darfaljavri (Lake Tarfala), located in an arctic-alpine environment in the Scandinavian Mountains, year-round water temperatures were previously reported for 2016 to 2019. Here, this record is continued for 2019-2020 and 2021-2022, complemented by time-lapse imagery records of the state of the lake surface, as well as degree-day modeling of ice phenology (timing of ice-on and ice-off). Darfaljavri is cryostratified during winter, with interannual variations in the thermocline's thickness and temperature range. The ice season lasts from October to July. Modeled ice-on dates match observed ones reasonably well; however, observed ice-off dates occur much later than modeled ones, likely because of cold impact from Darfaljavri's glacial environment as inferred from a comparison with a close tundra lake. Though new insights into the complex lake mixing and ice phenology are provided, it remains to attribute the characteristics of Darfaljavri's winter stratification to additional potential drivers, such as lake ice thickness, atmospheric heat fluxes, and the water balance of the lake.

Seasonal Carryover Effects following the Administration of Cortisol to a Wild Teleost Fish	PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY												Stress can have sublethal effects that are manifested either immediately or at spatial or temporal scales that are removed from the stress event (i.e., carryover effects). We tested whether a short-term elevation of plasma cortisol would result in seasonal carryover effects in wild largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides. Using exogenous hormone implants, we raised circulating cortisol concentrations in a group of wild fish for approximately 5 d in October 2007. We then compared activity (velocity, distance traveled) of cortisol-treated animals with that of sham-treated and control animals throughout the winter using an automated acoustic telemetry array. Immediately following treatment, the cortisol-treated fish showed increased activity relative to controls. However, this difference disappeared following the cessation of the elevation of circulating cortisol. During the winter of 2007 to 2008, the lake experienced a nearly complete winterkill event, providing insight into how a transient stress response can influence the response of wild animals to subsequent challenges. Most fish carrying acoustic transmitters succumbed during this winterkill event, but cortisol-treated fish died earlier than fish in other groups and showed a decrease in activity relative to controls and sham-treated fish before mortality. This study provides preliminary evidence of seasonal carryover effects in wild fish and yields insight into the ecological consequences of stress across broad temporal scales.

The results of the analysis of 180 phytoplankton samples taken in 1957 and 1958 are reported. Determinations were made where possible on living samples, but samples were preserved in HCHO or I2-KI-acetic acid also. Estimates of the volumes of phytoplankters in [mu]3/i are given. A list is given of the phytoplankters observed, with a brief description of their seasonal and vertical distributions. The chrysophytes dominated with the exception of the winter months, when bacteriophytes and dinoflagellates were of greater importance. At no time were the diatoms of any great significance. Calculations were made of the total biomass of the phytoplankton in the lake (assuming the density of the phytoplankton species approximated one.) Values ranged from 47.4 kg in September 1957 to 360 kg in late April of 1958. At the end of July there was marked vertical stratification of the phytoplankton. Similar stratification occurred in December and January, when most of the bacteriophytes and small monads were near the bottom. The winter phytoplankton was dominated by nannoplankters.																			0030-1299	1600-0706					1961	12	1					36	+		10.2307/3565170	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3565170													WOS:A19619538B00011

J	Poxleitner, M; Trommer, G; Lorenz, P; Stibor, H				Poxleitner, Monika; Trommer, Gabriele; Lorenz, Patrick; Stibor, Herwig			The effect of increased nitrogen load on phytoplankton in a phosphorus-limited lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Widespread use of artificial fertilisers and the burning of fossil fuels and/or biomass release a large amount of reactive nitrogen into the atmosphere. So far, the effects of increasing nitrogen deposition from the atmosphere have mainly been studied in nitrogen-limited limnic and marine systems. Interestingly, in phosphorus-limited lakes, additional nitrogen input might not affect phytoplankton biomass, but rather increase mainly the degree of phosphorus limitation. The resulting effects on plankton communities are difficult to predict and quantify. To estimate the effects of increasing nitrogen load on a spring phytoplankton community in a primarily phosphorus-limited system, a mesocosm experiment was performed in an oligotrophic lake, in which a gradient of six increasing nitrogen enrichment levels was applied. During the initial phytoplankton growth phase (spring bloom), molar, seston nitrogen:phosphorus ratios increased from 43 to 72 and carbon:phosphorus ratios from 328 to 542 with increasing nitrogen enrichment, indicating increased phosphorus limitation. Three commonly used phytoplankton biomass proxies (phytoplankton biovolume, chlorophyll a and particulate organic carbon) showed only minor responses to nitrogen enrichment. Different groups and species of phytoplankton varied in their responses to the nitrogen enrichment in both the growth phase (spring bloom) and the descending phase (clear water phase). Overall, we detected an effect of nitrogen enrichment on phytoplankton stoichiometry and community composition. The observed changes in the phytoplankton community combined with changes in abundances of heterotrophic nanoflagellates and ciliates indicate bottom-up driven alterations of the basal food web due to increased nitrogen loads.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				NOV	2016	61	11					1966	1980		10.1111/fwb.12829	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12829													WOS:000386022200012

The results show that the highest concentrations are located in the eastern and south-eastern part of the lake where the polluted water comes from the lagoon of Bizerte through the wadi Tinja as well as from the city of Mateur through the wadi joumine. The pollution indices and especially the heavy metal evaluation index (HEI) show high pollution specially located at the mouths of wadis and an increase of heavy metal concentrations, as a result of uncontrolled releases of domestic and industrial wastewater.

A model of degradation and production of three pools of dissolved organic matter in an alpine lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We investigated the transport and production of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in an alpine lake in the Colorado Front Range during snowmelt and the summer ice-free season by employing a new approach for distinguishing between three pools of DOM based on fractionation and spectroscopic characterization. Reactive transport modeling results confirm that terrestrially derived sources of humic DOM are dominant during snowmelt and that microbially derived humic and nonhumic DOM are produced in the lake in the summer, when rates of primary productivity are highest. DOM characterization and modeling results support the interpretation that losses of terrestrially derived humic DOM are dependent on photochemistry and indicate that the decay of nonhumic and microbially derived humic DOM is more influenced by heterotrophic degradation. Results suggest that production of nonhumic DOM can be directly related to chlorophyll a concentrations and that microbially derived humic DOM can be produced through condensation reactions. Furthermore, fluorescence and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of DOM suggest that the rate of decay of microbially derived humic DOM decreases as the redox state of quinone-like moieties of the DOM becomes more oxidized. This study quantifies the influence of DOM source on the chemical and biological reactivity of DOM in lakes. The methods presented in this study provide a framework for testing hypotheses related to the effects of a changing climate on lake ecosystem structure and function.

In this study, organic matter composition was analyzed using UV-vis spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-organic carbon detection (LC-OCD). Several allochthonous natural organic matter substances were collected including leaves, green leaves, forest soils, and paddy soils. The organic matter composition analysis in our study sites revealed that humic substances comprised the highest proportion (36.5-42.3%). Also, individual samples at each site exhibited distinct characteristics. This study used a humic substance-diagram (HS-diagram) and principal component analysis (PCA) to trace the sources affecting the river water quality and identify their origins. The humic substances of soil origin predominantly influenced the water quality, with the impact of organic matter significantly pronounced during the July rainfall period. Compared with the PCA results, the contribution of the humic substance (HS, 48.9%) and building block (BB, 42.0%) indices appeared higher between June and July in summer, likely due to non-degradable substances released by heavy rain. In fall, the contribution of low molecular weight neutrals increased from 71.2% to 85.2%, owing to a humic substance influx and decomposition. This study demonstrated the application of estimating the relative contributions of source materials in lakes utilized for drinking and agricultural water to identify sources, aiding in the development of efficient watershed management plans.																				2073-4395				NOV	2023	13	11							2766	10.3390/agronomy13112766	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13112766													WOS:001118294700001
J	Praharaj, T; Fortin, D				Praharaj, T.; Fortin, D.			Seasonal variations of microbial sulfate and iron reduction in alkaline Pb-Zn mine tailings (Ontario, Canada)	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Several studies have shown that SO4-reducing bacteria (SRB) are active in acidic sulfiderich mine tailings and sediments impacted by mining activities. SRB activity in acidic tailings has been shown to vary with seasons as a result of fluctuating in situ physico-chemical conditions. Iron-reducing bacteria (FeRB) also play an important role in Fe cycling in sediments impacted by mining activities, but their activity in mine tailings is poorly understood, despite the fact that geochemical evidence indicates that they might be active. The present study was undertaken to assess the seasonal changes in SRB and FeRB abundance and activity in alkaline Pb-Zn mine tailings (Calumet tailings) located near Ottawa, ON, Canada. Results showed that FeRB and SRB populations were present throughout the year at two different sampling sites at the Calumet tailings, but SO4 reduction rates (SRR) were lower in the spring than in the summer, indicating that SRB activity was affected by organic C availability and/or temperature. Surface agricultural runoff at one site provided ample nutrients and organic C to the tailings, but SRB activity remained lower than the site not impacted by nutrient runoff, suggesting that the type of organic C was different between the two sites and that less labile organic substrates were available to SRB in the organic-rich site. High SRB activity in the site containing low organic C inhibited the abundance of FeRB, and possibly their activity, as a result of abiotic reduction of Fe(III)-rich minerals by biogenic sulfides, which lowered the pool of final electron acceptors. The abiotic reduction pathway was consistent with the porewater data which showed that sulfide was consumed and SO4 produced, along with Fe(II). These results show a strong interdependence between SRB and FeRB activity, as observed in other environments, such as saltmarsh sediments. Low temperature did not appear to hinder FeRB abundance in alkaline tailings. Finally, despite evidence that SRB populations were active at both sites, the IS isotopic composition of the AVS and CRS fractions were not representative of biogenic sulfides, indicating that the overall S-isotope signature of mine tailings is more representative of abiotic sulfides originating from the ore body.

The processes that produce a large range of the delta B-11 values were investigated, including the possible input of seawater as well as the contrast delta B-11 compositions of acid sulfate and acid chloride crater lakes. The delta B-11 values of hot springs ranged from -2.4 to +28.7%o and acid crater lakes ranged from +0.6 to +34.9%0. The delta B-11 and Cl/B values in waters from the Parangtritis and Krakal geothermal systems confirmed seawater input. The delta B-11 values of acid sulfate crater lakes ranged from + 5.5 to +34.9%o and were higher than the delta B-11 of +0.6%o of the acid chloride crater lake. The heavier delta B-11 in the acid sulfate crater lakes was caused by a combination of vapor phase addition and further enrichment due to evaporation and B adsorption onto clay minerals. In contrast, the light delta B-11 of the acid chloride crater lake was a result of acid water-rocks interaction.

J	Du, LN; Li, Y; Chen, XY; Yang, JX				Du Li-Na; Li Yuan; Chen Xiao-Yong; Yang Jun-Xing			Effect of eutrophication on molluscan community composition in the Lake Dianchi (China, Yunnan)	LIMNOLOGICA												In this paper, three historical biodiversity datasets (from 1940s, 1980-1999 and 2000-2004) and results from the recent inventory are used to trace the long-term changes of the mollusks in the eutrophic Lake Dianchi. Comparison of the obtained results with those of earlier investigations performed during the period of 1940s and 1980-1999 as well as 2000-2004 showed that changes have occurred in the interval. There were 31 species and 2 sub-species recorded prior to the 1940s, but the species richness decreased from a high level of 83 species and 7 sub-species to 16 species and one sub-species from 1990s to the early of 21st century in lake body. Species from the genera of Kunmingia, Fenouilia, Paraprygula, Erhaia, Assiminea,Galba, Rhombuniopsis, Unionea and Aforpareysia were not found in Dianchi basin after 2000. The species from the genera Lithoglyphopsis, Tricula, Bithynia, Semisulcospira and Corbicula were only found in the springs and upstream rivers. Anoxia and the changing of substrates and fish species composition could explain why molluscan community composition changed in eutrophic Lake Dianchi. Additionally, the different sampling methods and ignore of the specific groups in earlier studies are cause for Sphaerium and Pisidium first found in our study. This study is first time to enlarge the investigation region to the Dianchi basin. Although some endemic species disappeared in the lake body, they still distribute in the springs and upstream rivers. The springs and upstream rivers are important refuges for mollusks.

D.; Eide, Nina E.; Bergersen, Espen; Madsen, Jesper			Resource partitioning in sympatric arctic-breeding geese: summer habitat use, spatial and dietary overlap of Barnacle and Pink-footed Geese in Svalbard	IBIS												The spatial, habitat and dietary overlap of two breeding goose species was studied in Sassendalen, Svalbard, in summer 2003 based on abundance within 500 x 500-m grid squares and faecal diet analyses during pre-breeding, nesting and post-hatching periods. More than half of all Pink-footed Geese Anser brachyrhynchus occurred in the absence of Barnacle Geese Branta leucopsis during nesting and post-hatching periods compared to c. 20% when concentrated by pre-breeding snow cover. In contrast, only 5% of Barnacle Geese were observed in the absence of Pink-footed Geese pre-breeding, 15% during nesting, and 35% post-hatching. Among six defined habitat types, Barnacle Geese resorted more to 'upland' habitats during pre-breeding and nesting and to lowland lakes post-hatching when compared to Pink-footed Geese. Although Pink-footed Geese showed less change in seasonal habitat preference, many shifted to the river valley bottom post-hatching, giving access to open water (predator avoidance) and lush green vegetation (foraging for goslings). The smallest extent of distributional overlap between the two species occurred post-hatching, but each species was also highly restricted by snow cover during pre-nesting. The greatest extent of overlap in distribution and diet occurred during incubation, when large dietary variation between different breeding valleys reflected local food availability around nests (probably a result of nest-site preference rather than food selection per se). Whether this means that increased interactions within and between the two goose species with future increases in local density are most likely to be manifest at this stage of the summer is impossible to determine without knowledge of available food resources and manipulative experiments. More detailed investigations of the effects of foraging by both species on plant structure, quality and community composition are necessary to predict likely outcomes of future changes in population densities of both species.

The MPA was created to conserve a genetically distinctive population of Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua. This article presents results from a study of the interannual variability in atmospheric and physical oceanographic characteristics of Gilbert Bay over the period 1949-2006. We describe seasonal and interannual variability of the atmospheric parameters at the sea surface in the bay. The interannual variability of the atmosphere in the Gilbert Bay region is related to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and a recent warming trend in the local climate of coastal Labrador. The related changes in seawater temperature, salinity and sea-ice thickness in winter are simulated with a one-dimensional water column model, the General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM). A warming Gilbert Bay ecosystem would be favorable for cod growth, but reduced sea-ice formation during the winter months increases the danger of traveling across the bay by snowmobile.

J	Johnson, TC; Brown, ET; Shi, JM				Johnson, Thomas C.; Brown, Erik T.; Shi, Junmin			Biogenic silica deposition in Lake Malawi, East Africa over the past 150,000 years	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												We report a 150,000 year record of the abundance of biogenic silica (BSi) in drill cores from the northern and central basins of lake Malawi. The periods of highest diatom burial at both sites occurred around 65-69 and 51-60 thousand years ago (ka) after the termination of prolonged, intense drought in the region. These peaks are believed to reflect elevated delivery of dissolved silica to the lake due to acceleration of chemical weathering in the drainage basin. The droughts that preceded these BSi depositional episodes occurred at precessional frequency, corresponding to times of minimum austral spring (or summer?) insolation in the region prior to 60 ka. Subsequent arid spells have not been as severe due to the reduced amplitude of precessional forcing as a result of the superimposed effect of eccentricity. However, biogenic silica records do not show significant sensitivity to precessional forcing. The BSi burial flux in the north basin displays strong millennial-scale variability since 50 ka, with peak values occurring during cold times in the Northern Hemisphere, as reflected in the Greenland ice core records. We observe no relationship between BSi and deposition of volcanic tephras in this system. The central basin core also displays millennial-scale variability in BSi abundance during the past 50 ky, of comparable magnitude to that in the north basin, but without systematic correlation to the north basin BSi or Greenland ice core records. In general, we conclude that BSi profiles from the north and (probably) south basins are more readily interpreted in terms of regional climate dynamics than are BSi profiles from more central locations in long, narrow tropical rift lakes. Diatom burial rates are suspected to be too influenced by silica limitations imposed by diatom production and burial in the upwelling systems at either end of these low-latitude lacustrine systems.

Submerged plant richness is a key element in determining the ecological quality of freshwater systems; it has often been reduced or completely lost. 2. The submerged and floating-leaved macrophyte communities of 60 shallow lakes in Poland and the U.K. have been surveyed and species richness related to environmental factors by general linearised models. 3. Nitrogen, and more specifically winter nitrate, concentrations were most important in explaining species richness with which they were inversely correlated. Phosphorus was subsidiary. Such an inverse relationship is consistent with findings in terrestrial communities. Polish lakes, with less intensively farmed catchments, had greater richness than the U.K. lakes. 4. The richest U.K. communities were associated with winter nitrate-N concentrations of up to about 1-2 mg L-1 and may correspond with 'good' ecological quality under the terms of the European Water Framework Directive.

Freshwater ecosystems are among the most endangered ecosystems in the world, highly sensitive to environmental change, and rich in biodiversity. Clarifying the mechanisms of co-occurrence of zooplankton and phytoplankton, which are the basis of freshwater ecosystems, can provide important insights into ecosystem stability. We employed the Hierarchical Modeling of Species Communities (HMSC) within Joint Species Distribution Models (JSDMs) to fit the abundance data of zooplankton and phytoplankton dominant species sampled in April (spring) and July (summer) 2023 in Shengjin Lake to understand their co-occurrence pattern in typical Yangtze-connected lakes. Due to biotic interactions, rotifers primarily exhibit a positive co-occurrence pattern with one diatom and one cyanobacterium, while copepods mainly show a negative co-occurrence pattern with one diatom and one cyanobacterium. Only one rotifer and one chlorophyta mainly display a positive co-occurrence pattern, mainly driven by shared environmental preferences in that they are more likely to co-occur in areas with lower transparency, lower total phosphorus (TP) levels, and relatively higher pH levels. These findings show that the co-occurrence mechanisms of zooplankton and phytoplankton differ under the influence of biotic interactions and environmental factors, neither of which can be overlooked. These findings may provide important implications for the management of zooplankton and phytoplankton, the fundamental components of wetland ecosystems.																				1424-2818				MAY 28	2025	17	6							382	10.3390/d17060382	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d17060382													WOS:001515730400001

Lakes varied in elevation from 218 to 1124 m, in area from 33 to 6303 ha and in maximum depth from 4 to 49 in. Deep lakes thermally stratified during summer with lake cooling and destratification in some by August. Lakes with mean depth of <5 m were polymictic during summer. Anoxia was measured at depth in the most fertile lakes, and metalimnetic oxygen maxima in several lakes were associated with conditions favoring sub-surface algal peaks. There were near equal numbers of dear and stained lakes. One lake was eutrophic and the others were either oligo-or mesotrophic. About half the lakes had TN:TP < 11 byweight, indicating a regional potential for N-limitation. Among Interior lakes,salinity, as measured by conductivity and alkalinity was correlated with TN and TP which fits with the long-recognized pattern between parent geology and nutrients. These data are compared with previous lake studies in the Interior.																			1040-2381					JUN	2003	19	2					122	132		10.1080/07438140309354078	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140309354078													WOS:000184887600004

Quantifying the Impact of Groundwater on Ice Formation in the Great Lakes	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Winter ice conditions in the Great Lakes play a crucial role in shaping ecological processes, shoreline dynamics, and regional weather patterns. Although atmospheric factors are widely acknowledged as the primary drivers of ice formation and duration, the influence of subsurface groundwater flow remains largely unexplored. In this study, we evaluate how spatially and temporally variable groundwater flux affects ice formation and thermal structure in Lakes Michigan and Huron, using a coupled hydrodynamic-ice model. Simulations were conducted for the winters of 2014, 2015, and 2016-a period characterized by distinct atmospheric and ice conditions-and were validated against observed ice concentration maps and temperature profiles. Results show that groundwater enhances ice thickness during colder winters by strengthening water column stability, limiting vertical mixing, and insulating the surface layer, thus promoting thicker, longer-lasting ice. Sensitivity analyses reveal that moderate increases in groundwater flux intensify stratification and prolong ice concentration, while an extreme, high flux (1000x) disrupts stability and reduces ice thickness. Coastal regions display more pronounced effects due to higher groundwater input, whereas offshore zones exhibit comparatively weaker responses. These findings highlight the significant role of groundwater flux in modulating ice dynamics and stratification in large freshwater systems such as the Great Lakes. This research underscores the importance of incorporating subsurface hydrology into coupled modeling frameworks to improve predictions of ice dynamics and water column stratification. Future work should focus on obtaining high-resolution observational data on groundwater flux and ice thickness, particularly near shorelines, to further refine coupled hydrodynamic-ice models.					; Phanikumar, Mantha/A-2523-2008	Gronewold, Andrew/0000-0002-3576-2529; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				SEP 7	2025	61	9							e2025WR040581	10.1029/2025WR040581	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2025WR040581													WOS:001566616600001

During each summer the lake stratified and low O2 levels limited the distribution of trout to shallow (0-4 m) surface waters. In the 1st summer following weed removal the numbers of black shags (Phalacrocorax carbo) counted at the lake increased, and their predation resulted in a decline in trout density. Growth rate and condition of the trout population then exceeded that of trout present before weed removal. During the 2nd summer after weed removal a cladoceran bloom was followed by low phytoplankton levels and high ammonia concentrations. A prolonged calm compounded this situation with the result that O2 levels in bottom and surface waters dropped below 2 ppm. These low O2 levels eliminated the trout population, but other fish species present survived. Elimination of aquatic plants affected the population dynamics of other fish species in the lake with potential implications for the trout. The experiment demonstrated the importance of weed beds in maintaining a stable fish community in lakes.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1984	18	2					115	127		10.1080/00288330.1984.9516035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1984.9516035													WOS:A1984TM67200002

The water column was sampled weekly for dissolved carbon dioxide, and the CO2 flux was estimated also applying the concentration gradient method. Temperature and oxygen profiles of the lake were measured twice a week. The measurements covered one full open-water period from April to November 2003, and it is the longest continuous CO2 record ever measured over a lake by EC. The sensible heat flux H was positive, that is, from the lake to the atmosphere, except in May, when it was >0 W/m(2) at night and <0 W/m(2) in daytime. The latent heat flux dominated clearly over H in spring and summer; that is, the Bowen ratio was less than 1. Higher-moment turbulence statistics proved to be efficient in detection of frequent nonstationary situations. Applying the statistical criteria for CO2 concentration and vertical wind speed, averaging over a 5-min period and selecting only the wind direction with longest fetch, we could obtain lake-representative CO2 fluxes. Footprint analysis based on a closure model revealed that the source areas were relatively short because of the presence of turbulence generated by the surrounding forest, compared to a larger lake with an extended smooth surface. We observed a net CO2 source of 0.2-0.4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) excluding July, when the flux was closer to zero. The results are consistent with the gradient method, based on more infrequent sampling, and both methods gave the same average flux, 0.2 mmol m(-2) s(-1), over the whole open-water period.

Iningainema pulvinus gen nov., sp nov (Cyanobacteria, Scytonemataceae) a new nodularin producer from Edgbaston Reserve, north-eastern Australia	HARMFUL ALGAE												A new nodularin producing benthic cyanobacterium Iningainema pulvinus gen nov., sp nov. was isolated from a freshwater ambient spring wetland in tropical, north-eastern Australia and characterised using combined morphological and phylogenetic attributes. It formed conspicuous irregularly spherical to discoid, blue-green to olive-green cyanobacterial colonies across the substratum of shallow pools. Morphologically Iningainema is most similar to Scytonematopsis Kiseleva and Scytonema Agardh ex Bornet & Flahault. All three genera have isopolar filaments enveloped by a firm, often layered and coloured sheath; false branching is typically geminate, less commonly singly. Phylogenetic analyses using partial 16S rRNA sequences of three clones of Iningainema pulvinus strain ES0614 showed that it formed a well-supported monophyletic Glade. All three clones were 99.7-99.9% similar, however they shared less than 93.9% nucleotide similarity with other cyanobacterial sequences including putatively related taxa within the Scytonemataceae. Amplification of a fragment of the ndaF gene involved in nodularin biosynthesis from Iningainema pulvinus confirmed that it has this genetic determinant. Consistent with these results, analysis of two extracts from strain ES0614 by HPLC-MS/MS confirmed the presence of nodularin at concentrations of 796 and 1096 mu gg(-1) dry weight. This is the third genus of cyanobacteria shown to produce the cyanotoxin nodularin and the first report of nodularin synthesis from the cyanobacterial family Scytonemataceae. These new findings may have implications for the aquatic biota at Edgbaston Reserve, a spring complex which has been identified as a priority conservation area in the central Australian arid and semiarid zones, based on patterns of endemicity.

Spawn was categorized according to the presence or absence of observable overripe eggs. No significant differences in female length, female weight, the number of eggs per female, egg size, the amount of ovarian fluid released during spawning, and ovarian fluid specific gravity, pH, and conductivity were observed between spawn containing overripe eggs and spawn without overripe eggs. Conductivity was significantly positively correlated to embryo survival only in spawn without overripe eggs, while the total number of eggs per female was only positively correlated to embryo survival in spawn with overripe eggs. Spawning female weight, the number of eggs per female, and egg size were significantly different in spawn containing overripe eggs where no embryo survival was observed compared with spawn containing overripe eggs with at least some embryo survival to the eyed egg stage. Although no definitive predictors of subsequent embryo survival were detected, spawning personnel are probably justified in discarding landlocked fall chinook salmon spawn if more than 10% of the eggs are overripe and the female releasing the eggs is smaller than normal with relatively fewer, smaller eggs.																			1522-2055					JAN	2003	65	1					49	55		10.1577/1548-8454(2003)065<0049:PIOEVI>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8454(2003)065<0049:PIOEVI>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000180644900010
J	Madoni, P; Uluhogian, F				Madoni, P; Uluhogian, F			Ciliated protozoa of a geothermal sulphur spring	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The species richness and the dynamics of the ciliate communities were studied at three stations along a streamlet formed by water discharged from a geothermal sulphur spring. Altogether, 73 species were identified. Ciliate coenoses were composed primarily of freshwater forms, but they were numerically dominated by euryhaline species. The great fluctuation in both number of species and individuals observed along the streamlet were due to vigorous chemical changes in the physico-chemical characteristics of the water. These changes were caused mainly by the sulphide and salt gradient observed along the water course. The maximum value of sulphide was observed in August with 391 mu M l(-1), and the highest conductivity value was observed in April with 18 mS cm(-1). The most characteristic and abundant species were small-sized bacterivorous scuticociliates which have a rapid ecological adaptability and whose tolerance Limits to environmental changes are wide. Bacterivorous scuticociliates such as Cyclidium citrullus, C. glaucoma, Cinetochilum margaritaceum, and Uronema nigricans were numerically dominant when the thermal water contained the highest concentration of sulphide. The diversity index values changed sharply in time both inside and among sampling stations, indicating unstable communities which depended on highly fluctuating conditions.																			0018-8158					SEP 19	1997	353						161	170		10.1023/A:1003067630809	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003067630809													WOS:000070979300014

(1986). Inorganic plant nutrients and phytoplankton successions were investigated during three years (1983-1985), and zooplankton successions during five years (1981-1985). The lake has since 1979 received large inputs of inorganic plant nutrients and organic matter from a floating fish farm, and has changed from an oligotrophic towards a eutrophic state. During the years of investigations, both total phosphorus and total nitrogen reached concentrations characteristic to eutrophic lakes. The primary production, however, ranged within values which are more typical of mesotrophic lakes. Phytoplankton sucessions changed to include an increased summer bloom, and the species composition was altered towards larger species. both events are described for eutrophic lakes in the PEG-model. The seasonal development of zooplankton was of an oligotrophic type according to the PGE-model, showing a single summer maximum during the five years of investigation, although the zooplankton biomass decreased. We suggest that the slower response by the zooplankton must be due to their longer life cycles.																			0003-9136					MAY	1989	115	3					401	415																WOS:A1989AA19300006

The biomasses of Chlamydomonas spp. and Chrysococcus spp. reached their maxima a few days later and Cryptomonas sp. became most abundant at the end of the experiment. After the phytoplankton maximum, about one week from the beginning of the experiment, grazing of algae by phagotrophic protozoans and phosphate depletion led to a rapid decrease of algal biomass and the community became predominantly heterotrophic. In spite of a large variation in algal biomass and primary production, the biomass of bacteria remained of the same order of magnitude as in algae both before and after the algal maximum. Bacteria were mostly responsible for the plankton respiration, which also showed no dependence on primary production. Since exudation by phytoplankton was also low, the nutrition of bacterioplankton was probably mainly based on allochthonous dissolved organic matter rather than on primary production. Thus the production of bacteria was an additional food source for higher trophic levels along with phytoplankton. Because filter feeding zooplankton was absent in the experiment, protozoans were the only grazers utilizing algae and bacteria. Essentially all growth of bacteria was used by bacterivores.

Analysing a large dataset on long-term monitoring of water quality and plankton with the SOM clustering	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) proved to be the method of choice for analysing a large heterogeneous ecological dataset. In addition to distributing the data into clusters, the SOM enabled hunting for correlations between the data components. This revealed logical and plausible relationships between and within the environment and groups of organisms. The main conclusions derived from the results were: (i) the structure of early summer plankton community significantly differed from that of late summer community in Lake Pyhaselka and (ii) plankton community in late summer was characterized by two functional groups. The first group was formed mainly by phytoplankton, rotifers, and small cladocerans, such as Bosmina spp., and driven by water temperature. The second group was formed by small copepods and the abundant generalist herbivorous cladocerans Daphnia cristata and Limnosida frontosa, which, in turn, associated with chlorophyll a concentration. Biomasses of Bosmina spp. and D. cristata showed decreasing monotonic trends during a 20-year study period supposedly due to oligotrophication. Versatile possibilities to cluster data and hunt for correlations between data components offered by the SOM decisively helped to reveal associations across the original variables and draw conclusions. The results would have been undetectable solely on the basis of unorganised values.

Characterizing the Great Lakes marine renewable energy resources: Lake Michigan surge and wave characteristics	ENERGY												The Great Lakes, Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie and Ontario, are a system of interconnected freshwater lakes located primarily in the upper region of North America and on the Canada United States border. Lake Michigan, the second largest in volume and the third-largest in surface area among the Great Lakes, is approximately 494 km long and 190 km wide. The historical wave data show that significant wave height can reach up to 6 m both in the northern and southern basins. In addition, the long-term lake level data reveal that storm surges can exceed 1.5 m in Green Bay, one of the shallowest parts of Lake Michigan. This study characterizes the marine renewable power generation resources including storm surge and wave for lake Michigan. It is shown that an extreme surge event similar to that of January 12, 1975 could contain a total theoretical potential energy of approximately 58 GWh. The analysis of the lake-wide wave data shows that the monthly mean wave power is greater in the central and southern basins. Wave power is highest in October and November, when the monthly mean wave power exceeds 9 kW/m. The monthly mean wave power is the lowest in late spring and during summer, when it becomes as low as 1.5 kW/m. As a result, it is found that there is significant potential marine renewable energy in Lake Michigan that may be suitable for generating meaningful levels of electricity from storm surges by developing artificial 'lagoons' in the shallower parts of the lake. This study, which follows the recent work on characterizing the Great Lakes' marine renewable energy resources [1], is the first attempt on characterizing lake Michigan's marine renewable energy resources.

We found that 1) the trophic state of Dianshan Lake transitioned from eutrophic to hypereutrophic in 1999-2000, and nutrient accumulation has accelerated since then; 2) TP was the primary limiting factor for algal biomass, with the regression coefficients of TP and chl a varying with different trophic states; and 3) TN may limit cyanobacterial growth in autumn.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				DEC	2010	25	4					549	554		10.1080/02705060.2010.9664404	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2010.9664404													WOS:000284243100007

The Role of the SO<mml:mrow>2 Radiative Effect in Sustaining the Volcanic Winter and Soothing the Toba Impact on Climate	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Volcanic eruptions are an important climate driver. The impact of Pinatubo-sized eruptions has been observed and is well constrained. The magnitude and duration of volcanic winter effects after supereruptions such as Toba remain disputed due to disagreement between the strong cooling predicted by models and much milder climate perturbations according to the paleodata. Here we present a reevaluated climate impact of a Toba-sized supereruption based on up-to-date GISS ModelE simulations. In this study, we account for all known primary mechanisms that govern the evolution of the volcanic plume and their nonlinear interactions. The SO2 radiative effects are evaluated for the first time in coupled climate simulations with the interactive atmospheric chemistry module. We found that SO2 effects on photochemistry, dynamics, and radiative forcing are especially prominent. Due to strong absorption in ultraviolet, SO2 feedback on photochemistry partially offsets the limiting effect associated with aerosol microphysical processes. SO(2 )greenhouse warming soothes the radiative cooling exerted by sulfate aerosols. SO(2 )absorption in the shortwave and longwave causes radiative heating and lofting of the volcanic plume, and boosts the efficiency of SO2 impact on photochemistry. Our analysis shows that SO2 lifetime and magnitude of effects scale up and increase with the amount of emitted material. For a Pinatubo-sized eruption, SO(2 )feedbacks on chemistry and dynamics are relevant only during the initial stage of the volcanic plume evolution, while local SO2 concentrations are high. For a Toba-sized eruption, SO2 effects are as important as sulfate aerosols and produce a less extreme volcanic winter.

The remoteness of these sites, coupled with the ecological characteristics of taxa involved, indicate that changes are primarily driven by climate warming through lengthening of the summer growing season and related limnological changes. The widespread distribution and similar character of these changes indicate that the opportunity to study arctic ecosystems unaffected by human influences may have disappeared.

Differential Interactions of Two Introduced Piscivorous Salmonids with a Native Cyprinid in Lentic Systems: Implications for Conservation of Roundtail Chub	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The effects of multiple nonnative piscivore species on native prey species in lentic systems are poorly understood. We studied the relative predation risks posed by two piscivorous salmonids (brown trout Salmo trutta and lake trout Salvelinus namaycush) to endemic roundtail chub Gila robusta in two lakes within the upper Colorado River basin. Gill nets were set in various habitat types to study habitat use by the three species before and after the onset of summer stratification. Roundtail chub and brown trout were mainly associated with shallow-water habitats, and this association did not change with thermal period. By contrast, lake trout habitat use changed with thermal period as fish moved from shallow areas in the spring to deepwater habitat after stratification. These habitat use patterns indicate that roundtail chub are more susceptible to predation by brown trout than by lake trout because both roundtail chub and brown trout occupy the littoral zone for a prolonged period. Diet data indicated that brown trout consumed littoral fish species (i.e., cyprinids), whereas lake trout primarily consumed opossum shrimp Mysis spp. and dipterans (true flies). Brown trout consumed proportionally more fish than did lake trout, began feeding on fish at smaller total lengths, and increased fish consumption during the period of thermal stratification. An important consideration for efforts to conserve lentic roundtail chub populations is the prevention of future introductions of littoral predators.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAR	2012	141	2					495	506		10.1080/00028487.2012.670189	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2012.670189													WOS:000303593400022

The growth of age 1+ and 2+ year smelts was very low probably due to the discontinuous supply of large invertebrates Chaoborus flavicans and Mysis relicta. Diet shift back to zooplankton in autumn, suggested the existence of a bottleneck in the growth of these age groups. Slow growth rate was further intensified by the onset of maturity at age 2 years, combined with the high diet and habitat overlaps between similar-sized 1+ and 2+ year smelts. Older 3+ and 4+ year smelts shifted to piscivory, i.e. cannibalism, during the growing season, which was seen as rapid increases in their growth rates.

However, the regional expression of humidity conditions during the last deglaciation and their possible forcing mechanism in northern China are controversial. Here, combined with published delta 18O data, we report 35-year-resolved delta 13C and 76-year-resolved Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca records from a stalagmite from 15.3 to 10.9 ka BP from Lianhua Cave, northern China. The LH4 stalagmite delta 18O record clearly records a weak monsoon event during the Younger Dryas (YD) from 12.8 to 11.6 ka BP and a strong monsoon event during the B & oslash;lling-Aller & oslash;d (BA) from 14.6 to 12.8 ka BP. In addition, the delta 13C and trace element ratio records, which represent local hydroclimatic changes, indicate wetter conditions during the BA and drier conditions during the YD, which appear to match well with the delta 18O variations on the millennial timescale. A comparison of 28 records from 17 sites along the modern margin of the China summer monsoon revealed that the BA was characterized by wet conditions; inversely, the YD was characterized by dry conditions throughout northern China, which is obviously different from the consensus of the wet YD and the dry BA in northern northeastern China. The covariance in northern China suggests that the hydrological variation may be modulated by the advance and retreat of the large-scale East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) circulation. Further comparison revealed an anticorrelated relationship between millennial-scale precipitation changes in northern China and the middle-lower reaches of the Yangtze River Valley during the last deglaciation. This correlation is analogous to the dipole precipitation mode at present, which is likely associated with the strength and position of the westerly jet and/or the western Pacific subtropical high, both of which play important roles in the spatial distribution of precipitation over eastern China.

Remote sensing of water quality is investigated to help monitoring the lake waters and to guide the water sampling more carefully over space and time. Satellite data of the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite of summer 1996 are analysed for a general overview of the variety of lake water within the test area. To get more quantitative information hyperspectral scanner data of the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (casi) are investigated. For these data a ratio of two bands pointing to chlorophyll absorption at 680 nm and a hull function over the absorption band have been applied. The results could be well related to the ground truth data taken by the Institute of Fresh Water Ecology in Brandenburg. They show differences in chlorophyll content even in December, a season of minimal bioproduction. Thus, further research in the summer season is promising to get good results in estimation of water quality parameters.																					0-8194-2528-1				1997	3107						178	186		10.1117/12.274726	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.274726													WOS:A1997BH93L00020

J	Jones, B; Renaut, RW				Jones, B; Renaut, RW			Hot spring and geyser sinters: the integrated product of precipitation, replacement, and deposition	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Complex ornate sinter deposits are found in many hot spring and geysers systems throughout the world, including those located in the Taupo Volcanic Zone on the North Island of New Zealand. Those sinters are formed of opal-A that replaced microbes, opal-A precipitated as cement, accessory minerals (e.g., kaolinite, jarosite, calcite), biological detritus (e.g., leaves, wood, pollen grains), and lithic detritus. The opal-A is compositionally variable because of the amount of water (OH and H2O) and, in some cases, accessory elements (e.g., Au, Ag) bound into its structure. The composition and fabric of the siliceous sinter found at any locality reflect the relative balance among the processes of replacement, precipitation, and deposition. The microbes that inhabit these systems are of critical importance because they are commonly replaced by and (or) encrusted with opal-A. In many settings, copious amounts of opal-A are precipitated as cement around the frameworks of silicified filaments. The cementation process, which continues for as long as waters supersaturated with respect to opal-A flow through the sinter, commonly reduces the porosity of the sinters by as much as 50%. This process is probably of far greater significance than has been previously recognized. The textural and compositional complexity of siliceous sinters found in hot spring and geyser systems reflects the myriad of interrelated processes that control their formation.

Only 40 (57.14 %) specimens were found to be naturally infected with Serrasentis sagittifer belonging to family Rhadinorhynchidae. The infection was recorded in the intestine, pyloric ceca, and the external surfaces of some internal organs of the infected fish. Seasonally, the prevalence of infection was increased to 77.14 % during summer season and decreased to 37.14 % during winter. Light and scanning electron microscopic investigation revealed that the adult worm was elongated (with broad anterior and narrow posterior ends) and measured 6.9-8.6 (7.6 +/- 0.2)x0.57-0.73 (0.63 +/- 0.02) mm for male and 10.2-12.1(11.5 +/- 0.2)x0.71-0.82 (0.76 +/- 0.02) mm for female. Proboscis was long and cylindrical with a length of 0.97-1.6 mm (1.2 +/- 0.2) for male and 1.12-1.17 mm (1.14 +/- 0.02) for female. It was covered with numerous uniform spines arranged longitudinally as 9-11 rows each equipped by 15-18 spines. Spines were triangular, arrow-shaped, strong, and covered with cuticular theca; they decreased in size from the apex to the base of the proboscis. The proboscis is followed by a short spineless neck region followed by the body proper which is supported by multiple combs of spines (16-20) on its ventral surface. Molecular analysis of 18S rDNA sequence for the parasite demonstrated a close identity (>83 %) between the present acanthocephalan and other previously described species within class Palaeacanthocephala with 98 % identity with the previously recorded S. sagittifer (acc. no. JX014227) which is supported by the morphological data and the presence of trunk spines arranged within rows (comb-like) and the presence of four cement glands in the males. So, according to the records of morphological and molecular analyses, the present parasite is classified as S. sagittifer belonging to class Palaeacanthocephala and family Rhadinorhynchidae with a new host record from the gilthead sea bream S. aurata of the Red Sea.

Selection Indicates Preference in Diverse Habitats: A Ground-Nesting Bird (Charadrius melodus) Using Reservoir Shoreline	PLOS ONE												Animals use proximate cues to select resources that maximize individual fitness. When animals have a diverse array of available habitats, those selected could give insights into true habitat preferences. Since the construction of the Garrison Dam on the Missouri River in North Dakota, Lake Sakakawea (SAK) has become an important breeding area for federally threatened piping plovers (Charadrius melodus; hereafter plovers). We used conditional logistic regression to examine nest-site selection at fine scales (1, 3, and 10 m) during summers 2006-2009 by comparing characteristics at 351 nests to those of 668 random sites within nesting territories. Plovers selected sites (1 m(2)) that were lower than unused random sites, increasing the risk of nest inundation. Plovers selected nest sites that were flat, had little silt, and at least 1 cobble; they also selected for 3-m radius nest areas that were relatively flat and devoid of vegetation and litter. Ninety percent of nests had <38% coverage of silt and <10% slope at the site, and <15% coverage of vegetation or litter and <31% slope within the 3-m radius. Gravel was selected for at nest sites (11% median), but against in the area 10-m from the nest, suggesting plovers select for patches or strips of gravel. Although elevation is rarely evaluated in studies of ground-nesting birds, our results underscore its importance in habitat-selection studies. Relative to where plovers historically nested, habitat at SAK has more diverse topography, substrate composition, vegetation communities, and greater water-level fluctuations. Accordingly, our results provide an example of how habitat-selection results can be interpreted as habitat preferences because they are not influenced by desired habitats being scarce or absent. Further, our results will be useful for directing habitat conservation for plovers and interpreting other habitat-selection studies.

As a large seasonal ice-covered lake located in Northern Mongolia, Lake Khovsgol not only provides important freshwater resources for the local population but also serves as a means of water transportation in summer and an important land-based activity for residents in winter. In this study, we used the sub-pixel offset technique with multi-temporal Sentinel-2 optical images to estimate the time-series displacement of lake ice in Lake Khovsgol from 7 December 2020 to 17 June 2021. With the processing of 112 Sentinel-2 images, we obtained 27 pairs of displacement results at intervals of 5, 10, and 15 days. These lake ice movement results covered three stages from ice-on to ice-off. The first stage was the lake ice growth period, which lasted 26 days from 7 December 2020 to 3 January 2021. Ice formation started from the south and extended northward, with a displacement of up to 10 m in 5 days. The second stage was the active phase of the ice cover, which took place from 3 January 2021 to 18 April 2021. Maximum displacement values reached 12 m in the east and 11 m in the north among all observations. The value of the lake ice movement in the north-south direction (NS) was found to be larger than in the east-west direction (EW). The third stage was the melting period, which closed on 17 June 2021. In comparison to the freezing date of November in past years, our results demonstrate the ice-on date of Lake Khovsgol has been delayed to December, suggesting a possible reason that the seasonal ice-covered lake located at the middle latitude has been affected by global warming. In addition, the lake ice movement of our results can reveal the regional climate characteristic. This study is one of the few cases to reveal the distribution characteristics and changing trends of lake ice on the Mongolia Plateau, providing a rare reference for lake ice research in this region.

J	Leckie, DA				Leckie, DA			Modern environments of the Canterbury Plains and adjacent offshore areas, New Zealand - an analog for ancient conglomeratic depositional systems in nonmarine and coastal zone settings	BULLETIN OF CANADIAN PETROLEUM GEOLOGY					Conference on Marine Conglomerate Reservoirs	2002	Calgary, CANADA					Modern depositional environments of the Canterbury Plains provide an analog for ancient conglomeratic depositional systems in nonmarine and coastal zone settings. The Canterbury Plains are up to 70 km wide and 185 km long, covering approximately 8000 km(2). The Plains are dominated by extreme geological and geomorphological processes - primarily climate, tectonics, and wave climate. The Canterbury gravels are primarily the deposits resulting from the coalescence of broad fluvial megafans that flowed into a high-energy coastal environment. Most fluvial channels in the basin are gravelly braided rivers. During the present sea-level highstand, a large portion of the plains can be considered as being situated in a low accommodation setting. Most sediment progradation and aggradation occurred and took place near the end of multiple glacial maxima and their associated sea level lowstands. As such, the fluvial megafans are nonmarine lowstand to early transgressive deposits. Valley entrenchment subsequently took place on the seaward side of the plains during the ensuing sea level rise and highstand. On the inner plains, tectonic uplift of the Southern Alps caused fluvial incision during highstand with coastal retreat concomitant with valley incision. The modern coastline is highly variable, being, at different places, progradational, retrogradational, and stable. The southern coast is dominated by powerful southerly swell conditions, which are highly erosive, and set up high rates of net northwards longshore drift. Consequently, the southern coast, south of Rakaia River, is transgressive, retreating at about 1 m/yr. All southern rivers are incising into the floodplain. In contrast, the northern coastline is situated in the wave shadow of a large, natural groyne formed by volcanic rocks of Banks Peninsula, resulting in lower wave conditions affecting that coast. The Pegasus Bay coastline progrades as a highstand wave-dominated delta. Since the last deglaciation, sea level has risen until a relatively stable period was reached about 6500 years ago. During this period of sea-level rise and subsequent highstand, the Waimakariri, Ashburton, Rangitata, Raikaia, and Hinds rivers became entrenched, forming sets of relatively steep terraces in proximal areas, which decrease in relief downstream from the mountains until a zone of no or minimal erosion is reached 8 to 15 km inland of the coast. Other environments of the Canterbury Plains include estuaries, the large brackish and shallow Lake Ellesmere into which a birds foot delta is prograding, a progradational strandplain, and localized occurrences of aeolian sediments on the progradational coast and on the plains. Steep gradients of rivers that are incised into the coastline prevent extensive estuarine conditions from developing on the transgressive coastline. One of the dominant controls on sedimentation is climate, mainly extreme amounts of precipitation. Large rivers commonly flood as a result of extreme precipitation derived from advecting moist, subtropical air from the west, rising over the Southern Alps, combined with spring and summer snow melt. In contrast, smaller rivers flood during winter months as a result of stationary easterly frontal systems. Maximum coastal erosion and littoral sediment transport occurs from large oceanic storms originating from the south and southeast.																			0007-4802					DEC	2003	51	4					389	425		10.2113/51.4.389	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/51.4.389													WOS:000222567300003
J	HARDING, WR				HARDING, WR			ZEEKOEVLEI - WATER CHEMISTRY AND PHYTOPLANKTON PERIODICITY	WATER SA												The paper provides a two-year record of Zeekoevlei's water chemistry and phytoplankton periodicity between April 1989 and March 1991. Zeekoevlei is a large (256 ha), shallow (mean depth 1,9 m) and well-mixed freshwater hyper-eutrophic lake situated in the winter-rainfall climatic region of South Africa. Water temperatures ranged from 10-degrees-C to 24-degrees-C. Due to the presence of dense cyanophyte phytoplankton populations, water transparencies ranged from 0,1 to 0,6 m with a mean of 0,28 m. Zeekoevlei experienced year-round, non-limiting nutrient concentrations. Accumulated algal sediments occupied 20% of the volume of the lake. Typical mean annual total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were 3,6 and 0,55 mg.l-1, respectively, reaching maxima during the winter. Chlorophyll a concentrations typically averaged 0,2 mg.l-1, reaching maxima of up to 0,8 mg.l-1. The phytoplankton population had a low generic diversity and an atypical seasonal periodicity dominated by Microcystis spp., which completely muted the seasonal periodicity of other phytoplankton taxa present. Zeekoevlei is an example of a poorly-flushed. nutrient-rich "reactor" which perpetuates dominance by evanophyte algae.																			0378-4738					OCT	1992	18	4					237	246																WOS:A1992JX05000002

The delta D-delta(18)O relationship for the river samples shows a slope of 9.12 +/- 0.29 which agrees well with the estimate of 8.99 +/- 0.33 based on a simple Rayleigh fractionation model. The unique signature of a higher deuterium excess (d) of the 'Western Disturbance' is preserved in these samples. An altitude effect of -0.9 per mil/km is observed in the delta(18)O of Indus waters. At a lower altitude (Beas) the altitude effect is almost double, indicating that the altitude effect decreases with elevation in this region.																			0253-4126					MAR	2000	109	1					109	115																WOS:000086838100011
J	Romare, P; Hansson, LA				Romare, P; Hansson, LA			A behavioral cascade: Top-predator induced behavioral shifts in planktivorous fish and zooplankton	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												It is well known that the effects of direct (lethal) predator-prey interactions propagate through food webs (the trophic cascade). However, in the present study we show for the first time that, parallel to the trophic cascade, there exists a "behavioral cascade" in the sense that behavioral responses, induced by the nonlethal presence of a top predator, are transmitted down the food chain over more than one trophic link. By using a new method, horizontal echo sounding, in an enclosure study in a shallow lake in southern Sweden, we recorded the swimming activity and refuge use of young-of-the-year (0+) roach (Rutilus rutilus) in the presence and the absence of a caged predatory fish. By connecting the predator avoidance behavior of 0+ roach with that of zooplankton throughout summer, we show that species interactions are more dynamic than had been predicted earlier by food web theory. In our study, 0+ roach changed their behavior by becoming less active in early summer and by hiding in a refuge in late summer in the presence of a piscivore, and this caused Daphnia to spend more time feeding in the open water than when piscivores were absent. Thus, we conclude that, to explain patterns of habitat use in natural systems, it is of crucial importance that we recognize the existence of behavioral cascades.					; Hansson, Lars-Anders/HCI-2735-2022	Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	2003	48	5					1956	1964		10.4319/lo.2003.48.5.1956	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2003.48.5.1956													WOS:000185433700023

For each type, we identify the main biodiversity patterns and ecological features, human impacts on the system and environmental issues, and discuss ways to use this information to improve stewardship. Examples of selected key biodiversity/ecological features (habitat type): narrow endemics, sensitive (groundwater and GDEs); crenobionts, LIHRes (springs); unidirectional flow, nutrient spiraling (streams); naturally turbid, floodplains, large-bodied species (large rivers); depth-variation in benthic communities (lakes); endemism and diversity (ancient lakes); threatened, sensitive species (oxbow lakes, SWE); diverse, reduced littoral (reservoirs); cold-adapted species (Boreal and Arctic fwh); endemism, depauperate (Antarctic fwh); flood pulse, intermittent wetlands, biggest river basins (tropical fwh); variable hydrologic regime-periods of drying, flash floods (arid-climate fwh). Selected impacts: eutrophication and other pollution, hydrologic modifications, overexploitation, habitat destruction, invasive species, salinization. Climate change is a threat multiplier, and it is important to quantify resistance, resilience, and recovery to assess the strategic role of the different types of freshwater ecosystems and their value for biodiversity conservation. Effective conservation solutions are dependent on an understanding of connectivity between different freshwater ecosystems (including related terrestrial, coastal and marine systems).					; Richardson, John/G-1513-2012; Naselli-Flores, Luigi/A-3824-2008; Znachor, Petr/F-8901-2014; Cid, Nuria/AAH-1433-2021; Hájek, Michal/H-1648-2014; Levkov, Zlatco/NBX-1786-2025; Galassi, Diana M.P./N-1674-2015; Kubecka, Jan/A-8230-2011; Čtvrtlíková, Martina/AAN-1106-2021; Heino, Jani/E-6342-2010; Hajek, Michal/H-1648-2014; Pringle, Catherine/I-1841-2012; Bolpagni, Rossano/Q-7053-2018; Turak, Eren/LPQ-5715-2024; Cantonati, Marco/G-4278-2018	Saber, Abdullah/0000-0002-4676-6998; Heino, Jani/0000-0003-1235-6613; Naselli-Flores, Luigi/0000-0003-3748-3862; segadelli, stefano/0000-0001-5260-6256; Cid, Nuria/0000-0002-9997-5523; Di Cicco, Mattia/0000-0002-3432-2492; Galassi, Diana M.P./0000-0002-6448-2710; Turak, Eren/0000-0001-7383-9112; Kubecka, Jan/0000-0001-9203-4854; Hajek, Michal/0000-0002-5201-2682; Levkov, Zlatko/0000-0002-1184-2356; Bolpagni, Rossano/0000-0001-9283-2821; 														2073-4441				JAN	2020	12	1							260	10.3390/w12010260	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12010260													WOS:000519847200260
J	Song, ZH; Zhu, CW; Su, JZ; Liu, BQ				Song, Zehao; Zhu, Congwen; Su, Jingzhi; Liu, Boqi			Coupling Modes of Climatological Intraseasonal Oscillation in the East Asian Summer Monsoon	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												The present study used harmonic and multivariate empirical orthogonal function (MV-EOF) analyses to identify the existence of climatological intraseasonal oscillation (CISO) in the diabatic heating, precipitation, and circulation of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). The strongest CISO signals are found in the north of the western North Pacific, possibly because of the horizontal gradient of diabatic heating induced by the seasonal land sea thermal contrast. Further, the phase relationship between the diabatic heating components maintains the EASM CISO. The first two coupling modes of EASM CISO in the circulation are robust during May through August, with a period of 40-80 days, and exhibit phase locking to the stepwise establishment of the EASM, which reveals the coaction of the Mongolian cyclone (MC) around Lake Baikal at 850 hPa, the western North Pacific subtropical high (WNPSH) at 500 hPa, and the South Asian high (SAH) over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) at 200 hPa. The first mode shows that the jointly enhanced MC, WNPSH, and SAH correspond to a tripole rainfall anomaly with strong mei-yu and baiu fronts over East Asia. The second mode, however, indicates the eastward and northwestward propagation of MC and WNPSH, respectively, with suppressed SAH, as well as a dipole rainfall anomaly over East Asia. Both the observations and numerical simulation verify the importance of daily diabatic heating and SST in maintaining the CISO modes over the WNP, where the condensation heating related to atmospheric forcing determines the local intraseasonal air-sea interaction.

J	SUTHERLAND, DR				SUTHERLAND, DR			SEASONAL DISTRIBUTION AND ECOLOGY OF 3 HELMINTH SPECIES INFECTING CARP (CYPRINUS-CARPIO) IN NORTHWEST IOWA, USA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The intestinal helminths most frequently infecting 522 Little Sioux River and 255 Lower Gar Lake carp (Cyprinus carpio) were Khawia iowensis, Pomphorhynchus bulbocolli and Capillaria catosomi. Prevalence and mean intensity of P. bulbocolli and mean intensity of C. catostomi were significantly higher in Lower Gar Lake than in Little Sioux River carp. During 1979-1981, the prevalence and mean intensity of K. iowensis were highest in summer 1979 and summer 1980. Pomphorhynchus bulbocolli and C. catostomi were nonseasonal in prevalence and mean intensity. All three helminths were overdispersed within the carp population. Khawia iowensis usually occurred in the anterior third of the carp gut. Capillaria catostomi was found throughout the intestine, but most worms occurred in the posterior quarter of the gut in light infections. Pomphorhynchus bulbocolli exhibited a preference for the posterior third of the intestinal tract. Significant correlation coefficients were calculated between carp length and prevalence and(or) mean intensity of Little Sioux River K. iowensis and P. bulbocolli. Male and female carp had similar prevalences and mean intensities of each parasite species.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				MAR	1989	67	3					692	698		10.1139/z89-100	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z89-100													WOS:A1989U167700024

The current field survey (2018-2021, 33 sampling occasions) was carried out in the central area of the lake. It revealed a macrobenthic community consisting of Chironomidae (40.72%) and Oligochaeta (59.23%). Chironomus plumosus was the dominant chironomid species (98.84%). A previous survey (2000-2002, 11 sampling occasions) had highlighted a similar community, although C. plumosus had a lower density, comprising a maximum of 295.0 ind. m(-2). This density was five times lower than the maximum densities of 2018-2021. A survey (2018-2021, 58 sampling occasions) conducted in the littoral zone revealed much greater chironomid biodiversity, with C. plumosus abundance of only 24.35% among all chironomids. This species showed an average density (88.1 ind. m(-2)) five times lower than its density (467.9 ind. m(-2)) in the central zone (2018-2021). Therefore, the central area of the lake, constituting about 90% of its total surface area, is the main region for the origin of C. plumosus adults and, consequently, during the summer months, it is the primary source of the annoying swarms that affect residents and tourists of the lake vicinity.

The filament volume concentration reached a maximum of 12 cm(3) m(-3); the depth of the maximum varied from 10.5 to 12.5 m. Changes in the depth distribution were attributed to a combination of (1) seiche movements, which raised or lowered the thermocline by up to 2 m over 36 h, and (2) flotation by the buoyant filaments relative to the isotherms, by up 0.4 m d(-1). These changes caused a 2-fold change in insolation at the Planktothrix peak. Estimates were made of the daily integral of photosynthetic O(2)-production, Sigma Sigma (NP), by the population of P. rubescens over a period of four cloudless days. The estimates were calculated from measurements of surface irradiance (at 5-min intervals), vertical light attenuation, temperature, filament volume concentration and the photosynthesis/irradiance (P/I) curves of filaments concentrated from the metalimnion. Despite the similar, high insolation on each of the four days, the calculated values of Sigma Sigma (NP) varied from 9 to 53 mmol m(-2) d(-1), owing to the changing depth distribution of the filaments. Measurements of P/I curves of lakewater samples incubated at a depth of 11 m showed changes in the photosynthetic coefficients during the day. These also generated large changes in calculated values of Sigma Sigma (NP). The computer spreadsheet used to calculate Sigma Sigma (NP) was modified to incorporate time-based changes in the photosynthetic coefficients and vertical distribution of the organism. These refinements provide a more accurate description of photosynthesis by the deep-living P. rubescens, which adjusts its position by buoyancy regulation to exploit the light field in the metalimnion, where it outcompetes other phytoplankton.

Composites are based on the Wheeler and Hendon MJO index as well as an index developed and maintained at NOAA's Climate Prediction Center (CPC), which is based on extended empirical orthogonal function analysis of upper-level velocity potential. Significant positive temperature anomalies develop in the eastern United States 5-20 days following Wheeler and Hendon MJO index phase 3, which corresponds to enhanced convection centered over the eastern Indian Ocean. At the same lag, positive precipitation anomalies are observed from the southern Plains to the Great Lakes region. Negative temperature anomalies appear in the central and eastern United States 10-20 days following Wheeler and Hendon MJO phase 7. These impacts are supported by an analysis of the evolution of 200-hPa geopotential height and zonal wind anomalies. Composites based on the CPC velocity potential MJO index generally yield similar results; however, they capture more cases since the index contains both interannual and subseasonal variability. There are some cases where the CPC index differs from that of WH in both MJO phase identification and its North American impacts, especially near the West Coast. This analysis suggests that MJO-related velocity potential anomalies can be used without the Wheeler and Hendon MJO index to predict MJO impacts.					yan, xue/A-5848-2013														0894-8755	1520-0442				OCT	2014	27	19					7356	7367		10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00105.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00105.1													WOS:000342840400011

Long-term trends in particulate nutrients in offshore waters of the Laurentian Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The Laurentian Great Lakes have undergone significant ecological changes in recent decades. We characterized patterns and long-term trends in particulate nutrient concentrations and seston stoichiometry from 1997 to 2019 across all five Great Lakes using spring and summer particulate nutrient data routinely collected by the US EPA GLNPO Water Quality Monitoring Program. We observed broad differences between the upper and lower Great Lakes, likely driven by varying surrounding land use, nutrient dynamics, light and hydrological regimes, and internal processes. Lakes Huron and Michigan exhibited the most significant changes in particulate nutrient concentrations throughout the study period. Despite changes in particulate nutrient concentrations, no significant trends in seston stoichiometric ratios were observed in any of the lakes. We identified two periods of abrupt change (mid-2000s and 2012) in the particulate nutrient time series. The first period of change was characterized by significant declines in total suspended solids, particulate phosphorus, and particulate organic carbon concentrations, concurrent with the timing of documented lower food web changes in Lakes Huron and Michigan but preceding the period of rapid quagga mussel expansion into the Great Lakes. Since 2012, particulate nitrogen has abruptly increased in all lakes, resulting in increasingly imbalanced seston N:P and C:N. These shifts may have broader ecological implications, potentially affecting organisms higher up the food web through altered nutrient availability and balance. Tracking particulate nutrients will continue to be critical for lake management.																			0380-1330					APR	2025	51	2							102539	10.1016/j.jglr.2025.102539	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2025.102539													WOS:001449904000001
J	BELLROSE, FC				BELLROSE, FC			THE VALUE OF WATERFOWL REFUGES IN ILLINOIS	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Waterfowl refuges in Illinois are primarily of value for migrating birds. There are 13 public refuges in the state aggregating about 57,350 acres. In addition there are lakes that provide natural refuges as well as private refuges established by duck clubs. Without suitable places to stop for resting and feeding during the hunting season, migrating waterfowl, particularly mallards and pintails, would move on to wintering grounds. Refuges on migration routes make more ducks available to hunters by building up local concentrations from which mallards and some other ducks fan out to feed over a radius of about 25 miles. In Illinois these refuges provide resting places which enable waterfowl to feed in mechanically picked corn fields and in hunted lakes and marshes within their daily cruising range. Therefore, more food is available on the flyway, relieving the demands of waterfowl for food on the wintering grounds. The most desirable size for refuges along migration routes is dependent upon several factors: shape of the body of water, degree of protection on surrounding lands, and distance from other refuges.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1954	18	2					160	169		10.2307/3797710	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3797710													WOS:A1954XS09600003

Concurrent increases in the TOC and TN concentrations indicate increases in terrestrial organic matter and nutrient inputs to the lake and a development of terrestrial vegetation and phytoplankton productivity related to increases in regional temperature and precipitation. C/N ratios reflect changes in the proportions of terrestrial and aquatic organic matter. Decreases in both delta C-13(org) and delta N-15 values indicate increases in the isotopically lighter, terrestrial carbon and nitrogen inputs to the lake, due to increases in surface runoffs; while a sharp decrease in the delta N-15 value implies a significant weakening in the biological activities of nitrifying and amonifying bacteria, due to abrupt decrease in the water temperature. The geochemical data indicate that regional temperature and precipitation exhibited increasing trends from 15,000 to 12,350 cal yr BP; temperature decreased abruptly at 12,350 cal yr BP and then maintained a low level from 12,350 to 11,400 cal yr BP, precipitation decreased to a relatively low level from 12,350 to 11,400 cal yr BP; and both temperature and precipitation returned to increase after 11,400 cal yr BP. The climate change in the Dali Lake region during the last deglaciation corresponds, within age uncertainties, to the Bolling-Allerod (BA) warm phase and Younger Dryas (YD) cold reversal occurring over northern high latitudes. However, the gradual and mild increasing trends of regional temperature and precipitation during the BA warm period contrasts with the general cooling trend in northern high latitude temperature, implying a dominant influence from increases in the Northern Hemisphere summer insolation; while the slight decreases in regional precipitation relative to the rapid and significant decreases in northern high latitude temperature during the YD cold period may have resulted from local moisture recycling or from an insensitive response of hydrology and ecology to the regional precipitation change.

J	ASSEL, RA				ASSEL, RA			IMPLICATIONS OF CO2 GLOBAL WARMING ON GREAT-LAKES ICE COVER	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Statistical ice cover models were used to project daily mean basin ice cover and annual ice cover duration for Lakes Superior and Erie. Models were applied to a 1951-80 base period and to three 30-year steady double carbon dioxide (2 x CO2) scenarios produced by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), the Goddard Institute of Space Studies (GISS), and the Oregon State University (OSU) general circulation models. Ice cover estimates were made for the West, Central, and East Basins of Lake Erie and for the West, East, and Whitefish Bay Basins of Lake Superior. Average ice cover duration for the 1951-80 base period ranged from 13 to 16 weeks for individual lake basins. Reductions in average ice cover duration under the three 2 x CO2 scenarios for individual lake basins ranged from 5 to 12 weeks for the OSU scenario, 8 to 13 weeks for the GISS scenario, and 11 to 13 weeks for GFDL scenario. Winters without ice formation become common for Lake Superior under the GFDL scenario and under all three 2 x CO2 scenarios for the Central and East Basins of Lake Erie. During an average 2 x CO2 winter, ice cover would be limited to the shallow areas of Lakes Erie and Superior. Because of uncertainties in the ice cover models, the results given here represent only a first approximation and are likely to represent an upper limit of the extent and duration of ice cover under the climiate change projected by the three 2 x CO2 scenarios. Notwithstanding these limitations, ice cover projected by the 2 x CO2 scenarios provides a preliminary assessment of the potential sensitivity of the Great Lakes ice cover to global warming. Potential environmental and socioeconomic impacts of a 2 x CO2 warming include year-round navigation, change in abundance of some fish species in the Great Lakes, discontinuation or reduction of winter recreational activities, and an increase in winter lake evaporation.																			0165-0009					JUN	1991	18	4					377	395		10.1007/BF00142968	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00142968													WOS:A1991FV75300003
J	Radbourne, AD; Ryves, DB; Madgwick, G; Anderson, NJ				Radbourne, Alan D.; Ryves, David B.; Madgwick, Genevieve; Anderson, N. John			The Influence of Climate Change on the Restoration Trajectory of a Nutrient-Rich Deep Lake	ECOSYSTEMS												Nutrient reduction in impacted lowland freshwater systems is ecologically and culturally important. Gaining a greater insight into how lakes respond to lowering nutrient loads and how climate-driven physical limnology affects present and future cycling of available nutrients is important for ecosystem resource management. This study examines the nutrient decline in a hypereutrophic freshwater lake (Rostherne Mere, Cheshire, UK) 25 years after sewage effluent diversion, a uniquely long-term analysis of a recovering nutrient-rich deep lake. Using nutrient, phytoplankton, climate and catchment hydrological monitoring, the contemporary lake system is compared to previous studies from 1990 to 2002. Nutrient change since point source load diversion showed annual average and maximum phosphorus (P) concentrations decreased significantly for the first 10 years (1992: similar to 600 mu g P L-1; 2002: similar to 200 mu g P L-1), but have since stabilised due to a substantial legacy sediment P internal load. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations have not substantially changed since diversion, resulting in the alteration of the DIN/SRP ratio from a system characterised by N limitation (N:P similar to 5), to one predominantly P limited (N:P > 20). Nutrient changes over this time are shown to drive ecological change, especially in the cyanobacterial and algal communities. Furthermore, very high-resolution monitoring of lake inflow and outflow (every 5 min during 2016) shows that water residence time at this lake is significantly shorter than previously estimated (similar to 0.8 years compared to previous estimates of similar to 1.6-2.4 years). Together with long-term data demonstrating that the stratification period at Rostherne Mere has increased by 40 days over the last similar to 50 years (due to later autumnal mixing), we show that a rapid rate of epilimnetic flushing together with a long stratification period substantially reduces the available epilimnetic P during the summer cyanobacterial bloom. This is of growing importance for many such lakes, given widespread climate-driven lengthening of stratification and a national trend of decreasing summer rainfall (decreasing seasonal flushing) but more intense summer storm events (resulting in short-term flushing events).

J	Li, CH; Wu, YH; Hou, XH				Li, Chunhai; Wu, Yanhong; Hou, Xinhua			Holocene vegetation and climate in Northeast China revealed from Jingbo Lake sediment	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					3rd LIMPACS	MAR 05-08, 2009	Chandigarh, INDIA					Vegetation and climate changes in Northeast China during the Late Quaternary are poorly known. Pollen analyses were undertaken on a 890-cm-long lacustrine sediment core recovered from Jingbo Lake, located in Southeastern Heilongjiang Province, China. Based on C-14 dating, the pollen record provides a basis for the reconstruction of vegetation and climatic changes since 9600 cal. BP in NE China. Prior to 6100 cal. BP, broad-leaved deciduous forest of Quercus, Fraxinus, and Betula dominated this area, which indicates that the climate during this period was warm and the Asian summer monsoon was stronger. From 6100 to 5600 cal. BP, the deciduous trees declined and Pinus increased, which suggests a transition of vegetation from broad-leaved deciduous forest to mixed coniferous-deciduous forest. Mixed coniferous-deciduous forest with Pinus, Quercus, and Betula expanded and dominated since 5600 cal. BP, indicating a gradual weakening of the Asian summer monsoon. During 2000-680 cal. BP, trees such as Pinus and Quercus declined and herbs including Artemisia, Labiatae, and Scrophulariaceae increased, indicating an extensive human impact on the vegetation. After 680 cal. BP, the forest regenerated due to changed agricultural activities, although the forest was cleared after the 18th century. The vegetation changes superimposed upon this general trend, especially the abundance of trees demanding warm climate conditions, show eight low temperature events at 9200-9000, 8200, 7000-6900, 6000-5600, 4200-3800, 2200-1800, 800, and 600 cal. BP. These short-lived events can be correlated to the spells of delta O-18 depletion in the Dongge Cave stalagmite record, which is widely accepted as a summer monsoon record.

Biogeochemical processes and buffering capacity concurrently affect acidification in a seasonally hypoxic coastal marine basin	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Coastal areas are impacted by multiple natural and anthropogenic processes and experience stronger pH fluctuations than the open ocean. These variations can weaken or intensify the ocean acidification signal induced by increasing atmospheric pCO(2). The development of eutrophication-induced hypoxia intensifies coastal acidification, since the CO2 produced during respiration decreases the buffering capacity in any hypoxic bottom water. To assess the combined ecosystem impacts of acidification and hypoxia, we quantified the seasonal variation in pH and oxygen dynamics in the water column of a seasonally stratified coastal basin (Lake Grevelingen, the Netherlands). Monthly water-column chemistry measurements were complemented with estimates of primary production and respiration using O-2 light-dark incubations, in addition to sediment-water fluxes of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA). The resulting data set was used to set up a proton budget on a seasonal scale. Temperature-induced seasonal stratification combined with a high community respiration was responsible for the depletion of oxygen in the bottom water in summer. The surface water showed strong seasonal variation in process rates (primary production, CO2 air-sea exchange), but relatively small seasonal pH fluctuations (0.46 units on the total hydrogen ion scale). In contrast, the bottom water showed less seasonality in biogeochemical rates (respiration, sediment-water exchange), but stronger pH fluctuations (0.60 units). This marked difference in pH dynamics could be attributed to a substantial reduction in the acid-base buffering capacity of the hypoxic bottom water in the summer period. Our results highlight the importance of acid-base buffering in the pH dynamics of coastal systems and illustrate the increasing vulnerability of hypoxic, CO2-rich waters to any acidifying process.

Based on weak evidence, this eastern population was thought to nest mainly in northern Labrador. Our May 1990 to 1998 surveys identified a breeding area in the forest regions of the Quebec Laurentian Highlands. We observed Barrow's Goldeneyes on 137 lakes and 5 rivers, of which 95.2% were along the north shore of the St. Lawrence estuary and gulf. The species was found mainly on small lakes (less than or equal to 10 ha) at greater than 500 m elevation. Most occupied lakes (96.5%) were within 100 km of the St. Lawrence River and 48.9% of them were headwater lakes. Four broods observed in 1998 represent the first eastern North American documentation of breeding. By means of satellite telemetry, 5 of 7 males captured on the wintering grounds were relocated on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River in May, 60-140 km inland from the estuary and gulf. Each male spent 34-50 days at its respective site, presumably with a mate. The north shore of the estuary and gulf may be the core breeding area for Barrow's Goldeneyes wintering along the St. Lawrence River.																			0043-5643					MAR	2000	112	1					1	7		10.1676/0043-5643(2000)112[0001:TBROTB]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1676/0043-5643(2000)112[0001:TBROTB]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000085653000001
J	Adams, KD; Sada, DW				Adams, Kenneth D.; Sada, Donald W.			Surface water hydrology and geomorphic characterization of a playa lake system: Implications for monitoring the effects of climate change	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Playa lakes are sensitive recorders of subtle climatic perturbations because these ephemeral water bodies respond to the flux of diffuse and channelized flow from their watersheds as well as from direct precipitation. The Black Rock Playa in northwestern Nevada is one of the largest playas in North America and is noted for its extreme flatness, varying less than one meter across a surface area of 310 km(2). Geo-referenced Landsat imagery was used to map surface-area fluctuations of ephemeral lakes on the playa from 1972 to 2013 to provide baseline data on surface water hydrology of this system to compare to future hydrologic conditions caused by climate change. The area measurements were transformed into depth and volumetric estimates using results of detailed topographic global positioning system (GPS) surveys and correlated with available surface hydrological and meteorological monitoring data. Playa lakes reach their maximum size (<350 km(2)) in spring, fed by melting snows from high mountains on the periphery of the drainage basin, and usually desiccate by early- to mid-summer. The combination of a shallow groundwater table, sediment deposition, and hydro-aeolian planation probably are largely responsible for the flatness of the playa. When lakes do not form for a period of several years, the clay- and silt-rich playa surface transforms from one that is hard and durable into one that is soft and puffy, probably from upward capillary movement of water and resultant evaporation. Subsequent flooding restores the hard and durable surface. The near-global availability of Landsat imagery for the last 41 years should allow the documentation of baseline surface hydrologic characteristics for a large number of widely-distributed playa lake systems that can be used to assess the hydrologic effects of future climate changes.

Jan; Qi, Jiaguo			Response of freshwater algae to water quality in Qinshan Lake within Taihu Watershed, China	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												Although frequent algal blooms in Taihu Lake in China have become major environmental problems and have drawn national and international attention, little is understood about the relationship between algal blooms and water quality. The goal of this study was to assess the growth and species responses of freshwater algae to variation in water quality in Qinshan Lake, located in headwaters of the Taihu watershed. Water samples were collected monthly from ten study sites in the Qinshan Lake and were analyzed for species distribution of freshwater algae and physiochemical parameters such as total nitrogen (TN), NH4+-N, NO3--N, total phosphorus (TP), chemical oxygen demand (CODMn) and Chl-a. The results showed that average TN was 4.47 mg/L, with 92.2% of values greater than the TN standard set by the Chinese Environmental Protection Agency; average TP was 0.051 mg/L, with 37.9% of values above the TP national standard; and average trophic level index (TLI) was 53, the lower end of eutrophic condition. Average Chl-a concentration was 12.83 mg/m(3). Green algae and diatom far outweighed other freshwater algae and were dominant most time of the year, with the highest relative abundances of 96% and 99%, respectively. Blue-green algae, composed mainly toxic strains like Microcystis sp., Nostoc sp. and Oscillatoria sp., became most dominant in the summer with the maximum relative abundance of 69%. The blue-green algae sank to the lake bottom to overwinter, and then dinoflagellates became the dominant species in the winter, with highest relative abundance of 89%. Analysis indicated that nutrients, especially control of ammonia and co-varying nutrients were the major restrictive factor of population growth of blue-green algae, suggesting that control in nutrient enrichments is the major preventive measure of algal blooms in Qinshan Lake.

Here I present data collected during two summers from 14 small, morphometrically similar freshwater ponds containing various densities of zooplanktivorous fish that support the above relationship between zooplanktivorous fish and lake thermal dynamics. During both years, mean summer water temperatures declined with increasing algal abundance (decreasing water transparency) and biomass of zooplanktivorous fish. Although this experiment was performed in small ponds, results presented here add to the growing body of information demonstrating that biological properties can have major influences on physical and chemical properties in freshwater ecosystems.					; Hambright, Karl/D-4086-2012	Hambright, K.

J	Sekaluvu, L; Zhang, LF; Gitau, M				Sekaluvu, Lawrence; Zhang, Lefei; Gitau, Margaret			Evaluation of constraints to water quality improvements in the Western Lake Erie Basin	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Severe environmental and health impacts have been experienced in the Western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB) because of eutrophication and associated proliferation of harmful algae blooms. Efforts to improve water quality within the WLEB have been on-going for several decades. However, water quality improvements in the basin have not been realized as anticipated. In this study, factors affecting water quality within the WLEB were evaluated with a view to differentiating their impacts and informing further assessments in the basin. Over the long-term (1966-2015) and basin-wide, total annual precipitation increased significantly by about 2.4 mm/year while mean monthly streamflows also increased during the same period although the increase was not significant (p = 036). There was, however, a significant increase in spring streamflows during this period (p = 0.003). Patterns in water quality parameters showed significant reductions in total suspended solids (TSS) (p < 0.001) and total phosphorus (TP) (p = 0.018) while soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) increased significantly (p < 0.001), and in particular from about 1995. Results of near-term (2005-2015) analysis showed a non-significant (p = 0.262) reduction in TSS concentrations of about 0.25 mg/L/year. TP concentrations did not vary substantially during the same period while a 0.11 mg/L/year increase in nitrate and a 0.001 mg/L/year increase in SRP were observed, with increases in nitrates being significant (p = 0.013). TP and SRP concentrations, however, remained high within the basin with daily values ranging between 0.03 and 1.84 mg/L and less than 0.002-0.52 mg/L, respectively. Basin-wide, both spring precipitation and spring streamflows increased significantly during the period 2005-2015 (p < 0.001). Overall, no substantial changes in land use were observed, suggesting that water quality responses might be attributable to management. Based on recent data, corn acreage in the basin and fertilizer applied to corn increased by 33% and 10% respectively. Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs) and impoundments were also important factors due to their prevalence in the basin. Based on the analysis, changes in agricultural management, increase in spring precipitation, CSOs, legacy phosphorus, and the presence of dams were thought to present constraints to water quality improvements despite conservation efforts within the basin.

In the polyhaline Lake Nakaumi, Japan, benthic fishes and crustaceans were negatively affected by oxygen depletion in the lower water under stratification during the warm seasons. On the other hand, marine and brackish species that once migrated into the Honjo Area, which is isolated from L. Nakaumi and has a homogeneous salinity structure, remained and grew there until winter. In the mesohaline Lake Shinji, two types of fishes were distinguished: one that migrated into the lake during the warmer seasons; and the other which stayed in the lake during winter. Fauna and production in L. Shinji were compared with those of a comprehensive study carried out approximately 35 years ago. For 35 years, Konosirus punctatus and Sardinella zunasi have increased in abundance, while Carassius sp. and Hypomesus nipponensis have decreased, Even with the recent acceleration in eutrophication of the lake, fish production during the warmer seasons has not declined for 35 years, but the fish fauna have drastically changed.

Predation by signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus on fish eggs and its consequences for coregonid recruitment	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The character and magnitude of predation by the invasive, ectothermic Pacifastacus leniusculus, a crayfish widely introduced to Europe and Japan from North America, on the eggs of coregonid fishes, vendace Coregonus albula and whitefish Coregonus lavaretus were examined by experimentation, modelling and field data. The present results showed that P. leniusculus has the potential to be very efficient predator of fish eggs under winter conditions, but the predation by P. leniusculus did not significantly decrease production of coregonid larvae during the years with a high P. leniusculus population in the study lake. Hence, the mortality caused by the novel invertebrate predator appeared to compensate for other yet unexplored mortality factors instead of having an additive effect on the present salmonids.

However, some important aspects of this region's climatic history remain unresolved. Here we present new high-resolution diatom records representing hydrological fluctuations at Lake Sibaya, Kwazulu-Natal, during the last 1800 years. The cores were dated with C-14, Pb-210, Cs-137, and exotic pollen, and were sampled at increments of 1-22 years. A low stand ending similar to AD 150 was followed by additional decadal to century-scale droughts, most notably similar to AD 1540-1760, and several periods of markedly wetter conditions similar to AD 220-290, AD 790-830, AD 1470-1540, and AD 1760-1860. The Medieval Climate Anomaly was generally wetter than average and the Little Ice Age was generally drier, but hydroclimate during both intervals was highly variable. These records confirm that local tree ring and stalagmite gray scale series represent rainfall variability, but they also show that widely cited stable isotope series from Makapansgat do not represent past climate as clearly. Because many interpretations of the climatic history of southern Africa have been influenced by those isotope data, we re-examine late Holocene precipitation variability in the summer rainfall zone, and also address model projections of future precipitation in the region.

The observations show a difference in the vertical distribution of heat and dissolved oxygen between the shallow and deep regions of a freshwater lake, and imply significant horizontal transport under the ice cover. The new measurements complement the lake database for winter observations, and will be used to improve predictive numerical modeling of lake mixing dynamics and water quality under the ice.

J	Wells, MG; Sealock, L				Wells, Mathew G.; Sealock, Lisa			Summer water circulation in Frenchman's Bay, a shallow coastal embayment connected to Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Water movements due to temperature gradients and short-term water level fluctuations control the flushing timescale of the many shallow embayments in the Great Lakes. In this article the water circulation within Frenchman's Bay is reported and estimates made of the hydraulic flushing timescale. This shallow freshwater embayment is permanently connected to Lake Ontario through a channel of width 30 m and depth of 2 m. The water flushing timescale is estimated by using a salt mass budget, leading to a flushing timescale of 710 days. During the summer, the exchange of water between the bay and the lake can be driven by a combination of horizontal thermal gradients, and by small but ubiquitous 1-5 cm oscillations in the water level of Lake Ontario. The water movements that are predicted due to water level fluctuations (caused by seiches, storm surges and tides) and due to horizontal thermal gradients leads to estimates of the flushing time of water within Frenchman's Bay in the range of 12-13.5 days, i.e. the same order of magnitude as the salt budget. One consequence of the temperature driven exchange flows is to cause strong and persistent temperature stratification within the bay, which in combination with high nutrient loading and low winds in summer leads to frequent anoxic events.

(CZECH REPUBLIC)	REPORTS OF FORESTRY RESEARCH-ZPRAVY LESNICKEHO VYZKUMU												High nitrogen load threats forest stand stability and affects subsequent function of the mountain forest over long time. The Orlicke hory Mts. are one of the most heavily nitrogen-polluted areas in the Czech Republic (HRTAKA et al. 2003; FOTTOVA 2003). The high deposition of nitrogen contributes to its accumulation in the forest ecosystems, which influences environment negatively (LUNDBORG 1997; FENN et al. 1998; PETERJOHN et al. 1999). The area of interest is threatened by nitrogen load particularly in the 5th, 6th and 7th forest vegetation zones (fir-beech, spruce-beech and beech-spruce). Nitrogen load poses also a risk for water and soil since the Orlicke hory Mts. have been declared a Protected Area of Natural Accumulation of Water (Czech acronym CHOPAV) for 39 years (see Czech Government Decree No. 40/1978 Coll.). Increased nitrogen load has been detected since 1990s. Assessing previously published studies, both national and from abroad ones, we hypothesized a way to reduce nitrogen load impact in the area of interest. One can summarize that substantially different views of mitigation of nitrogen load impact on the forest have been published (DE VRIES et al. 2012; KREUTZER et al. 2009). Despite missing signs of acute impacts on the Orlicke hory Mts. forests, increased nitrogen load poses a risk of further soil acidification and development of conditions supporting fungi infestation, and abiotic agents (frost, snow and wind) damage due to excessive growth and postponed maturing of new tissues. The primary objective of our study is to learn whether trend of nitrogen load (concentration, deposition) has been or has not been changed over long time. The secondary objectives are (1) nitrogen balance study within the UDL watershed and (2) nitrate content in surface waters of the area of interest. Air concentrations of NOx and atmospheric depositions of N-NO3, N-NH4 and total N were evaluated over long term. Time series began in 1995 (air concentrations) and 1993 (depositions). Data are from automated monitoring stations operated by Czech Hydrometeorological Institute. Atmospheric NOx concentrations were the highest in winter and the lowest in summer, amounting 10 mu g.m(-3) and 6 mu g.m(-3), respectively, at moderate decrease during the 2014-2016 period against the previous 2011-2013. This trend has been recently confirmed also by OULEHLE et al. (2016) via moderate declining N deposition. The UDL watershed was investigated by the Forestry and Game Management Research Institute - Opocno Research Station in cooperation with the Czech Geological Survey (GEOMON network). UDL deposition data were taken in open area, throughfall under young spruce, mature spruce and mature beech stands. UDL treatments were also used to monitor soil water saturation and nitrate saturation in water leaving the UDL watershed. To investigate nitrate concentrations in surface waters of the area of interest, samples were collected in October 1st 2015, May 11th 2016 and October 20th 2016. In total 23 streams and three springs were sampled (Table 1). Nitrogen (kg/ha) was shown separately according to compound origin, i. e. N-NH4 and N-NO3 deposited in open area, under forest stands and its export from the watershed (Fig. 7). N-NO3 deposition was greater compared to N-NH4. Nitrate N was the lowest alternately in the open area and in the watershed outlet water, higher under mature beech and the highest under mature spruce. 90% of the UDL watershed is a young spruce small-pole stand; this part of the forest cover, therefore substantially affects the N balance (Fig. 8) in the watershed. Exported stream runoff N was subtracted from throughfall N. The result could be considered the N consumed by the young spruces amounting 14.5 kg. ha(-1).year(-1). One can infer that the UDL is N-saturated and N consumption is in accordance with the development of the stand. Remaining N is exported to the stream water. Three times repeated sampling of surface waters did not reveal increased N concentrations (Fig. 9). More N-NO3 was in water from foothills compared to higher altitudes. The UDL watershed outlet water samples showed distinct differences in annual patterns of nitrate export. In dormant season, nitrate consumption by micro- and macro-vegetation component is low, stream water contains much more nitrate compared to summer (Fig. 10, 11). In winter hydrological half-year, a biforked (January, March) increased nitrate export is obvious (Fig. 11). Atmospheric N deposition differed obviously between both spruce-beech and spruce-open area treatments within UDL watershed. The high throughfall N deposition should be reflected in stream export and/or N soil pool. However, we found neither the former nor the latter. As the mature spruce and beech N consumption totals 13 kg.ha(-1) and 17 kg.ha(-1) respectively (see LOCHMAN, KANTOR 1985), we can suppose a great release of N due to denitrification, i. e. microbial reduction of NO3 into N(2)O( )and N-2. This raises another issue since N2O (80% is N) is considered a much more efficient greenhouse gas compared to CO2. UDL conditions seem to be supporting this process (see NUTTER, MORRIS 2004) because the watershed is a partly water-logged, drained site being high in carbon and "fertilized" with high N deposition. WEN et al. (2017) reported greater N2O emission from beech compared to spruce forest stand. From N balance point of view, atmospheric deposition and fixation in biomass and soil are the input processes, while extraction of wood and denitrification represent the export processes from forest ecosystems (VAN BREEMEN et al. 2002). LUNDBORG (1997) calculated that extraction of logging residues from N-polluted boreal spruce forests would decrease the N-lo ad amounting 1,000 kg.ha(-1) over 80-100 years of the rotation. Based on this, LUNDBORG (1997) proposed also a shorter rotation and low-emission combustion of the logging residues. Above-ground biomass should not be, however, extracted as whole tree biomass including removal of both slash higher in nutrients (KuNES et al. 2013) and forest floor. This practice would lead to depletion of the site over decades with subsequent low production of the forest (MusHiNsiu et al. 2017). The wood left on site becomes an environment where more N is fixed as wood-destroying and mycorrhizal fungi colonize it (RINNE et al. 2017). More N (PALVIAINEN et al. 2010a), P and Mg (PALVIAINEN et al. 2010b) were reported in rotting spruce stumps compared to birch ones. Low N concentrations in surface waters are attributable to restored consumption of N by forest ecosystems recovering from former air-pollution load (KoLidt et al. 2015). Higher export of nitrate in surface water were also related to loss of wood increment (KoLAft et al. 2015; GODEK et al. 2015). It is attributable to former malfunction of the roots. Similarly the intake of nitrate by roots changes in dormant season (ALEXANDER et al. 2007; ZAHORA et al. 2011; BETTEZ et al. 2015); our findings support that as well. Contemporary increased export of nitrate in water due to bark beetle outbreaks reported BEUDERT et al. (2015) and KOPACEK et al. (2017). The loss of roots' function led to three times higher nitrate concentrations in the Plane catchment-lake system; since 2011 the concentrations of nitrate decreased towards the level prior to forest death (KOPACEK et al. 2017). If nitrate concentration does not exceed 1 mg.l(-1), surface water can be considered clean (PITTER 1999). This was exceeded in all samples excepting the two spring water sites (5cest, VP). Despite some pollution, the all samples were relatively clean since the WHO limit for drinking water is 50 mg NO3 (i.e. 11.3 mg N-NO3 per liter).

J	Santofimia, E; López-Pamo, E; Palomino, EJ; González-Toril, E; Aguilera, A				Santofimia, Esther; Lopez-Pamo, Enrique; Julio Palomino, Edwin; Gonzalez-Toril, Elena; Aguilera, Angeles			Acid rock drainage in Nevado Pastoruri glacier area (Huascaran National Park, PerA): hydrochemical and mineralogical characterization and associated environmental implications	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The generation of acid rock drainage (ARD) was observed in an area of Nevado Pastoruri as a result of the oxidative dissolution of pyrite-rich lutites and sandstones. These ARDs are generated as abundant pyrite becomes exposed to atmospheric conditions as a result of glacier retreat. The proglacial zone contains lagoons, springs, streams and wetlands, scant vegetation, and intense fluvioglacial erosion. This work reports a comprehensive identification and the results of sampling of the lagoons and springs belonging to the microbasin, which is the headwaters of the Pachacoto River, as well as mapping results based on the hydrochemical data obtained in our study. The physical properties and water chemistry of 12 springs and 22 lagoons from the proglacial zone are also presented. Water springs are far from being chemically uniform, with pH and EC values ranging between 2.55-6.42 and 23-1110 mu S/cm respectively, which suggests a strong geologic control on water chemistry. Fe-SO4 (-2) concentrations confirm the intense process of pyrite oxidative dissolution. Many of the lagoons are affected by ARD, with low pH (similar to 3), and high EC (256-1092 mu S/cm) values when compared with unaffected lagoons (EC between 7 and 59 mu S/cm), indicating a high degree of mineralization. The affected lagoons show higher concentrations of SO4 (2-) and SiO2, and elements as Fe, Al, Mg, Mn, Zn, Co, and Ni, which are related to the alteration of pyrite and the dissolution of aluminosilicate minerals. Schwertmannite-goethite appears to be the most important mineral phases controlling the Fe solubility at a pH of 2-3.5. Moreover, they act as a sorbent of trace elements (As, Sb, V, Pb, Zn, Cr), which is an efficient mechanism of natural attenuation. Despite of this, the water flowing out from the basin is acid (pH 3.1) and contains significant concentrations of Fe (0.98 mg/L) and Al (3.76 mg/L) that confer mineral acidity to water. The Pachacoto River located 5.5 km downstream from this point showed a strong natural attenuation, with a pH of 6.9 and low concentration of metals. This mitigating process is possible due to (i) the formation of precipitates that retain toxic elements and (ii) the mixing with natural waters that promote dilution, which favor the increase of pH until circumneutral conditions.					santofimia, esther/ABG-5263-2020; Pamo, Enrique/ABG-9618-2020; Gonzalez-Toril, Elena/L-4823-2014	Aguilera, Angeles/0000-0003-4979-7578; Gonzalez-Toril, Elena/0000-0002-5750-0765; Palomino Cadenas, Edwin Julio/0000-0002-4589-6774; Santofimia, Esther/0000-0003-4236-6812													0944-1344	1614-7499				NOV	2017	24	32					25243	25259		10.1007/s11356-017-0093-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-0093-0								28929448					WOS:000414958700042
J	Akitomo, K; Tanaka, K; Kumagai, M; Jiao, CM				Akitomo, Kazunori; Tanaka, Kiyoshi; Kumagai, Michio; Jiao, Chunmeng			Annual cycle of circulations in Lake Biwa, part 1: model validation	LIMNOLOGY												We perform a series of model studies of the physical environment in Lake Biwa. In part 1, provided here, we formulate and validate a numerical model which consists of three-dimensional momentum and continuity equations for a Boussinesq fluid under the hydrostatic approximation in a rotating frame, the advective-diffusive equation for water temperature, and the full nonlinear equation of state for freshwater. Water motion is driven by heat flux and wind forcing which are evaluated from the time series of meteorological parameters observed at weather stations around and on the lake using bulk formulae. This model for the first time accurately simulates the annual and interannual variations found in observed water temperature and velocity fields in the 2004-2006 hindcast experiment. A current system of cyclonic (counterclockwise) and anticyclonic (clockwise) circular gyres appears above the seasonal thermocline during a stratified season, and a bottom flow appears along the eastern slope to sink cold dense water from the shallow eastern region to the deep lake bottom during an unstratified season. Full overturning of the water column during winter causes bottom water temperature to change interannually depending on the severity of winter. These successful results endorse the benefits of the model when investigating the physical environment of the lake over longer timescales.																			1439-8621					AUG	2009	10	2					105	118		10.1007/s10201-009-0267-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-009-0267-7													WOS:000268017800004
J	Wang, ZG; Li, XY; Liu, X; Song, ZY				Wang, Zhigang; Li, Xiaoyan; Liu, Xin; Song, Zhiyuan			Insights for river water resource management on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau: Perspectives from stable isotopes and the ecological environment	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Directly quantifying river evaporation loss and internal water vapor circulation on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) poses significant challenges. However, stable isotope technology has emerged as an effective method for revealing the internal dynamics of river water. This study was the first to estimate the evaporation loss and recirculating precipitation of rivers in summer on the QTP based on the stable isotope technology. Combined with remote sensing technology, the ecological and hydrological effects of river internal circulation on vegetation growth were revealed. Our findings revealed that the average river evaporation loss ratio was 14.86 % +/- 1.2 %, whereas the average river recycled precipitation ratio was 12 % +/- 0.36 % in summer on the QTP. Notably, the cumulative recycled precipitation of rivers in summer reached 702.5 x 108 m3, which was comparable to the water capacity of Qinghai Lake. Vegetation around the river on the QTP has demonstrated a nuanced nonlinear response to both river evaporation loss and recycled precipitation. Specifically, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) value of 0.4 and the recycled precipitation of 10 mm emerged as critical thresholds, marking significant inflection points for vegetation growth promotion around the river. Notably, the regions with the highest river evaporation loss were concentrated in river source regions in summer, underscoring the necessity of implementing ecological stewardship in these critical zones. In light of these observations, it is imperative to consider the far-reaching ecological consequences of river evaporation loss and recycled precipitation, particularly within the river source regions on the QTP. The research and vigilant monitoring are essential to facilitate sustainable river water resource management and mitigate potential ecological disruptions in this ecologically sensitive region.

J	Schubert, H; Sagert, S; Forster, RM				Schubert, H; Sagert, S; Forster, RM			Evaluation of the different levels of variability in the underwater light field of a shallow estuary	HELGOLAND MARINE RESEARCH												The underwater light climate of a shallow estuary located at the southern coast of the Baltic Sea has been investigated, with special emphasis on the spectral irradiance composition and on short-term irradiance fluctuations caused by vertical mixing and wave focussing. The inherent optical properties of the water body were dominated by phytoplankton pigment absorption in the long-wavelength range and by coloured, dissolved organic matter (cDOM) absorption in the wavelength range <500 nm, including ultraviolet-A (UV-A) and ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B). Pronounced particulate scattering combined with the absorption values to give very high attenuation coefficients, especially for the shorter wavelengths of UV-B radiation. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was found to be reduced to 1% of the surface value within 0.8 m in the inner, hypertrophic end of the estuary and within 1.9 m in the outer, eutrophic parts of this system, with corresponding 1% penetration depths for UV-B of 0.13 and 0.31 m. During late winter and early spring, the period when reduced atmospheric ozone concentrations and enhanced UV-B have been reported over northern Europe, the irradiance levels in the water column were greatly reduced, due to strong attenuation by ice cover and overlying snow, cDOM concentration of the water was also found to remain at a high level during these periods, and indeed throughout the year, thus reducing the exposure of organisms to UV-R and PAR still further. A complex irradiance regime was found in this system, with irregular and high amplitude fluctuations caused by wind-induced vertical mixing and wave focussing being superimposed upon the solar-angle-dependent seasonal and daily cycles. The methods used to quantify the short-term fluctuations are described, and their relevance to phytoplankton physiology is discussed. The wave-focussing effect is unique to the aquatic environment, and measurements showed that average subsurface irradiances could be increased by up to 5 times for periods lasting for <1 s. The highest irradiances recorded during wave-focussing events reached over 9,000 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1).					; Forster, Rodney/J-1756-2019	Forster, Rodney/0000-0001-6990-1673; 													1438-387X	1438-3888					2001	55	1					12	22		10.1007/s101520000064	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s101520000064													WOS:000167849700003

J	Coe, MT; Bonan, GB				Coe, MT; Bonan, GB			Feedbacks between climate and surface water in northern Africa during the middle Holocene	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Observations indicate that the area of lakes and wetlands in northern Africa was considerably greater during the middle Holocene than at present. Simulations are designed to examine whether expanded surface waters may have had a significant impact on the strength of the summer monsoon of northern Africa. Three experiments with the National Center for Atmospheric Research community climate model (NCAR CCM3) are analyzed, a modem and two middle Holocene (6000 years before present) simulations, one with and one without prescribed expanded surface water. There is a significant increase in the strength of the summer monsoon in the middle Holocene simulation due to the enhanced seasonal insolation cycle. The addition of surface waters result in a June, July, and August mean increase in the net surface radiation (5%), an increase in the latent heat flux (30%), a decrease in the sensible heat flux (10%), and an increase in the near-surface specific humidity (>5%) compared to the middle Holocene simulation without surface water changes. The changes in these simulated climate variables are comparable in scale to changes due to orbital forcing alone. The expanded surface waters result in a cooling of the atmosphere and anticyclonic flow over the large water bodies in summer relative to the simulation without surface water changes. The combination of increased atmospheric moisture and altered circulation results in significant changes to the precipitation distribution in northern Africa including a small increase in the zonal mean July precipitation to the north of the lakes and a decrease to the south. The geographic distribution of the precipitation with surface water changes is qualitatively in better agreement with observations than the distribution with orbital forcing alone but still does not fully match the expansion implied by observations nor the expansion required to produce the simulated middle Holocene surface waters used in this study. The results of this study suggest that surface waters were an important factor in the climate of northern Africa during the middle and early Holocene and that they must be included for accurate simulation of this climate.

Low-temperature tolerances of tropical fish with potential transgenic applications in relation to winter water temperatures in Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Application of fluorescent protein transgenes in tropical freshwater fish is used in research (e.g., in zebrafish) and in the commercial ornamental aquarium trade. To assess the overwinter potential of such fish in Canada, we examined the minimum temperature tolerance of three wild-type species (zebrafish, Danio rerio (Hamilton, 1822); black tetra, Gymnocorymbus ternetzi (Boulenger, 1895); tiger barb, Puntius tetrazona (Bleeker, 1855)) used as fluorescent models in the aquarium trade, as well as four lines of green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic and wild-type zebrafish used in research. Both tetra and barb had lower temperature tolerance limits that were higher than surveyed winter temperatures in Canada, and the lower tolerance limits of zebrafish lines was only within the range of a few surveyed lakes in some years. One line of GFP zebrafish had a lower temperature tolerance limit that was significantly higher than those of other lines, suggesting that some fluorescent transgene constructs may alter tolerance to extreme temperatures. When lines of zebrafish were reared at 8, 10, or 28 degrees C for 4 months, all lines were capable of producing viable embryos after cold rearing. These results indicate that tropical transgenic fish models used in research and in the aquarium trade are not expected to persist over winter in Canadian water systems.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				MAR	2018	96	3					253	260		10.1139/cjz-2017-0043	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2017-0043													WOS:000427385500010
J	Thompson, KL; Pauli, JN; Zuckerberg, B				Thompson, Kimberly L.; Pauli, Jonathan N.; Zuckerberg, Benjamin			The Vulnerability of Overwintering Insects to Loss of the Subnivium	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												AimWinter climate change threatens the subnivium (i.e., the microhabitat that exists between the snowpack and the ground), and the community of species that depends on it for overwintering survival. One group of species that will likely exhibit an array of responses to subnivium loss is overwintering insects because they vary in their cold tolerance strategies and lower thermal limits. For an assemblage of eight insect species that range in their cold tolerance strategies and include both pollinators and pests, we investigated species-specific vulnerabilities to shifting subnivium conditions.LocationGreat Lakes region in the United States.MethodsWe applied information on each insect's supercooling point to spatially- and temporally-explicit models of minimum subnivium temperatures generated from active-warming experiments and comprising three scenarios: current conditions (i.e., control), +3 degrees C and +5 degrees C.ResultsAlthough species varied in their vulnerabilities, our predictions indicated that exposure to lethal temperatures generally decreased under warming of 3 degrees C, but increased under warming of 5 degrees C, indicating that once enough warming happens, a tipping point is reached. We also found that freeze-tolerant species (i.e., species that can survive at temperatures below their supercooling point) possess a more cryptic vulnerability to winter climate change because sustained below-freezing temperatures were sufficient to induce vulnerability (i.e., predicted mortality), even when temperatures were above the supercooling point.Main ConclusionsThis work provides a better understanding of the vulnerability of different insect species to winter climate change, which is critical because overwintering survival and the fitness consequences incurred during overwintering likely represent important bottlenecks for the population dynamics of subnivium-dependent species.

The sequence and causes of the eruption were reconstructed from the distribution, textures, grain-size, component and chemical characteristics of the related deposits, and video record. The eruptive deposits are divided into ballistics, pyroclastic density current and ash-fall deposits. A large number of ballistic clasts (mostly <10 cm in diameter; maximum size 1.6 m) are scattered within about 500 m from the center of the crater. Almost half of the ballistics appear as fresh and unaltered basaltic andesite rocks interpreted to be derived from a fresh batch of magma, while the rest is weakly to highly altered clasts. A relatively thin ash derived from pyroclastic density currents covered an area of 2.3 km(2) with the SE-trending main axis and two minor axes to the NE and NW. The pyroclastic density current deposit (maximum thickness < 10 cm even at the crater rim) is wholly fine grained, containing no block-sized clasts. Based on the isopach map, the mass of the pyroclastic density current deposit was estimated at ca. 5.2 x 10(4) tons. The ash-fall deposit is finer grained and clearly distributed to about 8 km west of the source crater. The mass of the ash-fall deposit was calculated at about 2.7 x 10(4) tons. Adding the mass of the pyroclastic density current deposit, the total discharged mass of the September 14, 2015 eruption was 7.9 x 10(4) tons. The September 14 pyroclastic density current and ash-fall deposits consist of glass shards (ca. 30%), crystals (20-30%) and lithic (40-50%) grains. Most glass shards are unaltered poorly crystallized pale brown glasses which probably resulted from quenching of juvenile magma. This suggests that the September 14, 2015 event at the Nakadake first crater was a phreatomagmatic eruption. Similar phreatomagmatic eruptions occurred at the same crater on September 6,1979 and April 20,1990 whose eruptive masses were one order larger than that of the September 14, 2015 eruption. These events highlight the potential hazard from phreatic or phreatomagmatic eruptions at Nakadake first crater, and provide useful information that will assist in preventing or mitigating future disasters at other similar volcanoes worldwide.

ECOLOGICAL STATE AND NEW APPROACHES TO THE RESTORATION OF LAKE UVILDY, RUSSIA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE												Lake Uvildy is situated in the North of Chelyabinsk region. Lake Uvildy is one of the largest and the most unique of South Ural's lakes. In 1975-1977 the drought occurred and water supplies dried up in South Ural. 234 million cubic meters were moved from the Uvildy lake in Argazi reservoir, which was a source of water supply of the Chelyabinsk city. The lake's water level fell by more than 4 meters. Only in 2008 the water level returned to the previous position, but riparian vegetation was flooded. In July 2014 we carried out an ecological survey of the lake in five sites. We discovered submerged tree and shrub vegetation at 50-70 meters from the bank. Chemical analysis of water revealed the accumulation of organic substances and the transition of nitrogen from nitrate to nitrite and ammonia, of sulfur from sulfate to sulfite and hydrogen sulphide, of carbon to methane. We found blue-green algae (Microcystis, Anabaena, Oscillatoria) in all the sites. It indicates the beginning of water eutrophication. We proposed a new method of ecological restoration of the lake. In August 2014 we cleaned the bottom of the lake in two research points with a special innovative bottom-cleaning machine working both as a pump and a crusher. The research in summer 2015 showed that the water quality had significantly improved and the process of eutrophication had stopped in the points where the bottom was cleaned. Works on the lake trophicity will be continued.

As the largest contributor of phosphorus to Lake Erie, the dominantly agricultural MRW in northwest Ohio has been recommended to reduce phosphorus loads by 40%. To achieve such reductions, three agricultural nutrient management practices, (1) fertilizer placement within the soil, (2) adjusted seasonal timing of fertilizer application, and (3) adjusted date of fertilizer application to drier days have been recommended. To determine the potential phosphorus load reduction from implementing these three management practices, a SWAT model of the MRW was developed to evaluate the effectiveness of each practice for reducing SRP and total phosphorus (TP) load to the lake. Management scenarios were modeled with variations of the three practices from 2007 to 2012, and compared to historical data. Overall, maximum fertilizer placement had the greatest potential to influence SRP and TP loads; reducing spring SRP and TP loading by 42% and 27%, respectively compared to baseline levels. Seasonal fertilizer application timing also impacted spring SRP and TP loads, but to a lesser degree. Changing the date of application from wetter days to drier days across the watershed did not significantly affect SRP or TP loads, but this result is likely due to limitations of the SWAT simulation. These results indicate that maximizing fertilizer placement has a great potential to reduce TP and SRP runoff from the MRW. (C) 2016 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of biodiversity is essential for conserving these ecosystems. The Yangtze River floodplain is a key wintering area for waterbirds in East Asia, but may be experiencing biotic homogenization-the process of increasing similarity among communities-likely driven by human activities. However, previous studies were concentrated in limited wetlands and species, hindering effective assessment of spatiotemporal patterns. Based on synchronized surveys of wintering waterbirds in 2004-2005 and 2019-2020, this study revealed the spatiotemporal diversity patterns of the communities in relation to the inundation area of corresponding period, which was proved to be a key driver of waterbird richness. Besides its positive correlation with species richness and functional space (taxonomic and functional alpha diversity), the inundation area also promotes spatially nested patterns, while negatively correlated with temporal changes in species composition (temporal taxonomic beta diversity). Early signs of biotic homogenization, often considered a potential ecological risk, were observed in the communities, manifested as marked expansion of human-associated winners and decline of losers. Concurrently, the spatial beta diversity declined and zeta decline curve flattened in 2019-2020, although nonsignificant. This study reveals the spatiotemporal diversity patterns of wintering waterbirds in the Yangtze River floodplain, highlighting the pivotal role of the inundation area. Conservation strategies should be developed at the catchment scale, including the protection of wetlands with extensive inundation areas, the hydrological management and ecological restoration for wetlands with limited inundation areas, and the enhancement of longterm monitoring.

J	Bryant, LD; Brockbank, N; Austin, D				Bryant, Lee D.; Brockbank, Niamh; Austin, David			To mix or not to mix? A holistic approach to stratification-preserving and destratification aeration of drinking-water supply reservoirs	WATER RESEARCH												Aeration is used globally as a remediation method for lakes and reservoirs with methods generally falling into two categories, those which preserve natural stratification (hypolimnetic aeration; HA) and those which destratify reservoirs through mixing of the water column (destratification aeration; DA). The United Kingdom and Australia largely focus on DA methods to manage harmful algal blooms and decrease trace metal concentrations, whereas the United States and Europe frequently focus on HA techniques to increase dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations and decrease benthic nutrient and metal release from the sediment. A more holistic understanding of how the different techniques influence water quality in regard to raw water supply and ecosystem health should lead to more efficient treatment, reducing wasted energy and other costs during both reservoir management and the drinking-water treatment process. This study compares HA and DA on stratification, DO, and cyanobacteria concentrations in a single drinking-water supply reservoir during the 2016 summer stratification period. HA preserved stratification but could not maintain sufficient hypolimnetic DO past late April in this functionally eutrophic reservoir, establishing conditions favourable to cyanobacteria. An incipient cyanobacteria bloom formed that was subsequently dispersed after DA was initiated on May 05. Continuous monitoring revealed the formation of these issues in real-time and informed a switch from HA to DA, thereby allowing for a pro-active rather than reactive approach to reservoir management and subsequent drinking-water treatment. Both HA and DA are put forward as successful aeration strategies depending on management goals; however, performance is strongly site-specific. Such approaches are likely to become increasingly important as reservoir management tools to combat stratification-driven water quality issues under the pressing threats of anthropogenic activity and climate change.

Palynological study of Lake Kotokel' bottom sediments (Lake Baikal region)	RUSSIAN GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS												Pollen and AMS(14)C analyses of bottom sediments from the upper nine meters of the Lake Kotokel' section were carried out. The regional climate and landscape dynamics during the Late Glacial and Holocene has been reconstructed with an average time resolution of similar to 120 years. It is shown that the climatic conditions in the Kotokel' basin during Termination I (similar to 15.5-11 ka) were characterized by short drastic changes resulting in the reorganization of landscapes and vegetation. Five short (400-1200 years) intervals have been recognized: 15.5-14.7, 14.7-14.3, 14.3-13.2, 13.2-12.5, and 12.5-11.7 ka. In the early Holocene (similar to 11 ka), the climate became less continental and stayed such till similar to 7 ka. Later on, it again became more continental, which led to a significant decrease in average annual precipitation and winter temperatures and an increase in average summer temperatures. The pollen record from Lake Kotokel' agrees with the general climatic trend for the Northern Hemisphere. The amplitude of vegetation and climatic variations during the Late Glacial is best expressed as compared with the previous regional pollen records. This is probably because the ecosystem of the small lake localized deep inside the continent, at the boundary of two large ecotones (forest and steppe), is highly sensitive to moisture deficit. The new dated detailed pollen record from the Lake Kotokel' bottom sediments might be regarded as a key section for the reconstruction of variations in regional vegetation and climatic dynamics for the last 15-15.5 kyr. The results obtained refined the kind of changes in regional vegetation, and the reliable age model permitted intra-and interregional correlations of environmental changes. (C) 2011, V.S.

J	Wu, XD; Liu, XQ; Wang, J; Yamamoto, M				Wu, Xudong; Liu, Xingqi; Wang, Jianjun; Yamamoto, Masanobu			Climatic and ecological changes of the past 1900 years inferred from long-chain alkenones in Kusai Lake, northern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												We report 1900-year long records of alknone concentration, C-38/C-37 ratio, and U-37(k), U-37(k') and a newly-developed alkenone unsaturation index U-37(k '')-based temperatures in a sediment core retrieved from Kusai Lake in the northern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The predominance of C-37 and C-38 alkenones with minor presence of C-39 and C-40 alkenones, and the absence of C-38 methyl alkenones are indicative of alkneones produced by Isochrysis, which is consistent with the results of sedimentary haptophyte DNA analyses. The interval from 400 to 1200 AD is characterized by higher alkenone concentrations and C-38/C-37 ratios than the other intervals, which can be attributed to the predominant production of Isochrysis during the entire phytoplankton blooms. With the assistance of information on gene abundance, we attributed this phenomenon to drastic ecological changes in Kusai Lake around 1200 AD in response to climatic changes from warm and wet to cold and dry conditions, and resultant decreased riverine inflow but increased nutrient concentration. The U-37(k '')-based temperatures with U-37(k '') substituting U-37(k') in a equation concluded based on studies on lakes from high latitude areas in Germany are the most reliable reconstructed summer surface water temperatures for Kusai Lake since they are close to the current summer monthly mean temperature of Wudaoliang Meteorological Station, approximately 50 km to the south of Kusai Lake, and exhibit variations that are generally in accordance with those of the 51-year moving average summer temperatures reconstructed from thicknesses of varve light layers in Kusai Lake sediments. Besides, variations showed by this U-37(k '')-based summer surface water temperatures are also generally consistent with those showed by reconstructed temperatures in China.

Cryospheric components are sensitive to climate warming, and changes in the cryosphere can lead to serious hazards to human society, while the comprehensive understanding of cryospheric hazards largely remains unknown. Here we summarized the hazards related to atmospheric, oceanic and land cryosphere. The different types of cryospheric hazards, including their phenomena, mechanisms and impacts were reviewed. Our results suggested that: 1) The recorded hazards from atmospheric cryosphere including frost, hail, freezing rain decreased or showed great spatial heterogeneities, while their future changes are difficult to predict, and the extreme cold events in winter may increase in the future; 2) Sea ice extent declines rapidly, and iceberg numbers will increase. The permafrost-dominated coastline erosion will be exacerbated by climate warming. Meanwhile, the sea level rise is expected to continue in the next decades; 3) The glacier collapse, glacial lake outbursts and paraglacial readjustments will increase in the future. Although the total area of snow cover will decrease, the heavy snow events, snow avalanches, and snowmelt floods will not decrease simultaneously. The permafrost-related rock and debris flow and thaw slump will also increase with permafrost degradation. Taken together, we concluded the cryosphere is shrinking, while cryospheric hazards will likely increase in a warming climate.

H.; Lee, Shih-Yu; Putnam, Aaron E.; Wang, Xianfeng			South Pacific Split Jet, ITCZ shifts, and atmospheric North-South linkages during abrupt climate changes of the last glacial period	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												A number of key paleoclimate records in the Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes exhibit climate changes synchronous with abrupt climate changes in the North Atlantic. We advance a hypothesis argued from consideration of model evidence, observational climate diagnostics, and atmospheric dynamics that attributes said climate changes in the Southern Hemisphere to a modulation in the strength of the South Pacific Split Jet, a pronounced zonally asymmetric feature of the wintertime Southern Hemisphere westerlies. North Atlantic cooling is associated with a weaker Split Jet, characterized by weaker South Pacific subtropical and subpolar jets and a strengthened midlatitude jet. It leads to climate impacts over the South Pacific sector that coincides with regions with observed paleoclimate changes timed to the North Atlantic. These circulation changes are envisioned to operate in addition to the climate impacts resulting from the oceanic bipolar seesaw. A proposed global atmospheric teleconnection links North Atlantic cooling to the weakening of the Split Jet. North Atlantic cooling induces a southward shift of the marine Intertropical Convergence Zone and weakening of the Asian monsoon. The resulting Hadley circulation change weakens the wintertime South Pacific subtropical jet, and which in turn leads to a weaker South Pacific Split Jet. A weaker Split Jet leads to a southward shift of the zero wind-stress curl line, implying a shift in the same sense for the South Pacific subtropical front. Over land, it leads to winter warming over New Zealand, winter cooling over subtropical South America, drying over Western Patagonia, and winter warming and wetting of southernmost Patagonia. Our hypothesis also predicts reduced storminess over West Antarctica. Similar changes but of opposite sign occur in the Northern Hemisphere, where a stronger wintertime North Pacific subtropical jet increases precipitation over the Western United States.

Monoecious hydrilla tuber dynamics following various management regimes on four North Carolina reservoirs	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												Hydrilla [Hydra la verticillata (L.f.) Royle] is a federally listed noxious weed that has quickly spread through much of the United States. Long-term hydrilla control is complicated by persistent subterranean turions (tubers) that have been shown to remain viable for at least 6 yr. Tuber bank elimination is essential for long-term management or eradication efforts. Research was conducted on four North Carolina reservoirs to evaluate monoecious hydrilla tuber dynamics and to determine the effects of specific management techniques on monoecious hydrilla tuber densities over time. Lake Gaston, Lake Tillery, Shearon Harris Lake, and the Tar River Reservoir were sampled for up to 7 yr. Management practices and their effects on tuber density were assessed on each lake. Fluridone treatment sites were assessed on Lakes Tillery and Gaston, whereas a combination of fluridone application, drought-induced summer drawdown, and late-stage triploid grass carp stocking was assessed on the Tar River Reservoir. Sites on Lake Gaston and Shearon Harris Reservoir with no active management were also monitored. Dewatering (2007 only) and fluridone application from 2007 through 2012 plus a low-density grass carp stocking in 2013 resulted in a 100% tuber density decrease in the Tar River Reservoir. Two tubers recovered in fall 2012 were assumed to be 6 yr or older, and were still viable. On the unmanaged Shearon Harris Reservoir, average whole-lake tuber densities ranged from 838 to 2,050 tubers sq m(-1) from 2008 to 2013. Lake Gaston sites subjected to fluridone treatment every other year demonstrated a tubers m(-2) bank reduction of 28% after 2 yr and 63% after 4 yr. Conversely, Lake Gaston sites that were treated consecutively exhibited a 75% tuber density reduction in 2 yr and a 93% reduction after 3 yr. Based on these data it would take five alternate-year treatment cycles to match the tuber reduction reached in three consecutive-year treatments. Tuber densities as low as 11 m(-2) were adequate for a significant recovery in biomass and a 1,136% increase in new tuber production in just one season. Results suggest that by managing the tuber bank there is the potential to conserve management resources by switching to less intensive and costly strategies when densities are deemed to be at a nonnuisance level.																			0146-6623					JAN	2016	54						12	19																WOS:000367965100002

The lake was found to be highly heterogeneous with regard to the distribution of salinity; its value during summer varied from almost negligible (in the northern sector) to as high as 23.65 +/- 8.13 ppt (in the central sector). The inter-seasonal variation of salinity was found to be the highest in the central sector. It was further observed that the western region of the central sector of the lake remained even more saline than the southern sector during summer. Altogether 12 macrophyte species were identified from the lake. The lake, particularly its northern and the central sectors, was found to be extensively colonized by these macrophytes. It was also observed that the distribution of the macrophytes and the massiveness of their colonization were dependent on the salinity condition of the lake. The study suggests that the Lake is threatened to loose its identity, which could be avoided by adopting methods to increase its salinity.

This study aims to investigate the abundance of MPs and their possible sources in surface waters of different ecosystems, such as sea, lagoon, and lake. We classified MPs in terms of their color and type and established the relationship between the MPs in surface waters with different characteristics. The mean MP abundance (33 particles L-1) detected herein was higher than that in the previously conducted studies. Fragment particles (37.95%) were determined to be the dominant MP type, and the predominant MP color was blue (75.28%). As for the seasonal MP distribution, its highest content (48.03 particles L-1) was observed in autumn, unlike that reported by other studies. The findings of this study reveal the effects of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharge and current flow on the MP distribution in the study area. This study aims to provide representative data on the MP abundance and distribution, as well as MP-affecting parameters for similar aquatic areas in other parts of the world. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The reconstruction is based on a core recovered from a terrestrialised carbonate bench at Hawes Water, a small hard-water lake in northwest England. The record shows that temperatures rose rapidly after the Younger Dryas with temperatures reaching 14.0 degrees C at the beginning of the Holocene. Over millennial timescales, the temperature record points to a slight rise in temperatures towards the top of the sequence at around 8000 years before the year 2000 (b2k). The trend is punctuated by a series of cool oscillations (at 11 200, 11 400, 10 700, 10 400, 9300 and 8300 b2k) and by a short period (11 300 to 10 250 b2k) when temperatures were considerably warmer (up to 14.9 degrees C). The five cool oscillations coincide with temperature reversals found elsewhere in the North Atlantic region and in the Greenland ice core records. These cool events correlate well with both meltwater fluxes from the Laurentide and Scandinavian ice sheets and periods of low solar activity. Two of these oscillations (at 9300 and 8300 b2k) vary significantly from the early-Holocene mean. C-IT shift rapidly during both these events and temperatures fall similar to 1.6 degrees C below the early-Holocene mean trend for similar to 50-60 years. The results presented here provide an insight into the instability of the early-Holocene climate in the British Isles and demonstrate the sensitivity of chironomids to rapid climatic events during the early Holocene.

J	Marangoni, R; Messina, N; Gioffré, D; Colombetti, G				Marangoni, R; Messina, N; Gioffré, D; Colombetti, G			Effects of UV-B irradiation on a marine microecosystem	PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY												Purpose of this work was to study the effect of UV irradiation on a microecosystem consisting of several interacting species. The system chosen was of a hypersaline type, where all the species present live at high salt concentration; it comprises different bacteria; a producer, the photosynthetic green alga Dunaliella salina; and a consumer, the ciliated protozoan Fabrea salina, which form a complete food chain. We were able to establish the initial conditions that give rise to a self-sustaining microecosystem, stable for at least 3 weeks. We then determined the effect of UV irradiation on this microecosystem under laboratory-controlled conditions, in particular by measuring the critical UV exposure for the two main components of the microecosystem (algae and protozoa) under UV-B irradiances comparable to those of solar irradiation. In our experiments, we varied irradiance, total dose and spectral composition of the actinic light. The critical doses at irradiances of the order of 56 kJ/m(2) (typical average daily irradiance in a sunny summer day in Pisa), measured for each main component of the microecosystem (algae and ciliates), turned out to be around 70 kJ/m(2) for ciliates and 50 kJ/m(2) for D. salina. By exposing microecosystems to daily UV-B irradiances of the order of 8 kJ/m(2) (typical average daily irradiance in a sunny winter day in Pisa), we found no effect at total doses of the order of the critical doses at high irradiances, showing that the reciprocity law does not hold. We have also measured a preliminary spectral-sensitive curve of the UV effects, which shows an exponential decay with wavelength.

J	Jan, J; Breton, F; Borovec, J				Jan, Jiri; Breton, Felipe; Borovec, Jakub			Shallow-lake sediments release nutrients by complete destratification events	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												The development of phytoplankton communities in hypereutrophic shallow lakes, often used for aquaculture, is not fully understood and can sometimes be unpredictable. Focusing on the abiotic factors that regulate their succession, we recorded short-term mixing events in a shallow lake and examined their relationship with nutrient release from sediments in the lab. In situ measurements reveal a dynamic cycle of mixing and stratification during summer, when the lake mostly stratifies during the day and mixes at night, depending on wind conditions. The studied lake was stratified 45% of the time and, on average, mixed every 1.5 days. In terms of hydrodynamics, the velocities of surface and bottom waters are similar in magnitude, regardless of whether conditions are calm or windy. Stirred-core experiments recreated both lake hydrodynamic regimes and the observed patterns of destratification at the study site. Temporal destratification experiments show that the sediment releases more solutes during complete mixing than during partial destratification, due to an increase in sediment/water concentration gradients. This results in more phosphorus and ammonia being released, and more nitrate being consumed by sediments, when the water column is fully mixed compared to when a bottom layer remains unmixed. The effect of dissolved oxygen did not directly influence nutrient release by Fe-P compounds dissolution, as oxygen above the sediment did not fall below 50% saturation, but mixing enhanced the transport of electron acceptors to the sediment. The cycle of stratification and mixing appears to be a key factor in internal loading under oxic conditions.

Maternal effects better predict walleye recruitment in Escanaba Lake, Wisconsin, 1957-2015: implications for regulations	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Maternal influences on age-0 walleye (Sander vitreus (Mitchill, 1818)) recruit abundance and survival from egg to fall were observed in Escanaba Lake, Wisconsin, in 1957-2015. Annual egg production best explained variation in age-0 recruitment, compared with female relative abundance, and adult abundance (sexes combined). Age-0 recruitment was not significantly correlated with any temperature metric tested or our index of yellow perch (Perca flavescens (Mitchill, 1814)) abundance. Survival of walleye from egg to fall age-0 was positively correlated with the percent contribution of large females (>55.9 cm) to annual egg production. Mean size diversity of females by length class did not influence age-0 recruit abundance or survival over time. Evidence for maternal effects via size- and age-specific influences on fecundity and age-0 walleye survival suggest that exploitation may influence natural recruitment by altering adult female size structure. Given recent declines observed in walleye natural recruitment in the upper Midwestern USA, understanding the roles of maternal drivers and exploitation on recruitment is critical for sustainable walleye management.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				DEC	2018	75	12					2320	2331		10.1139/cjfas-2017-0318	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2017-0318													WOS:000449791000020
J	Liu, XJ; Wang, Y; Zhang, CY; Chen, ZH; Meng, XY				Liu, Xianjing; Wang, Ying; Zhang, Chuanyi; Chen, Zehao; Meng, Xiangyu			Improved method for benthic ecosystem health assessment by integrating chemical indexes into multiple biological indicator species-A case study of the Baiyangdian Lake, China	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												A comprehensive and scientific assessment of benthic ecosystem health is key to the rational selection of endogenous pollution reduction technologies for lakes. However, current assessments are mainly limited to biological indicators and ignore the actual benthic ecosystem situations, such as the impact of eutrophication and heavy metal pollution, which may lead to the one-sidedness of the evaluation results. In this study, taking Baiyangdian Lake, the largest shallow mesotrophic-eutrophic lake in the North China Plain, as an example, the chemical assessment index and biological integrity index were first combined to estimate the biological condi-tions, nutritional status and heavy metal pollution of lakes. The indicator system incorporated three biological assessments (benthic index of biotic integrity (B-IBI), submerged aquatic vegetation index of biological integrity (SAV-IBI) and microbial index of biological integrity (M-IBI)) and three chemical assessments (dissolved oxygen (DO), comprehensive trophic level index (TLI) and index of geoaccumulation (Igeo)). Twenty-three attributes of B-IBI, fourteen attributes of SAV-IBI and twelve attributes of M-IBI were screened by range, responsiveness, and redundancy tests to keep the core metrics that were significantly correlated with disturbance gradients or showed strong discriminatory power between reference and impaired sites. The assessment results of B-IBI, SAV-IBI, and M-IBI showed significant differences in the response to anthropogenic activities and seasonal change, among which the submerged plants showed more significant seasonal differences. It is difficult to reach a comprehensive conclusion regarding the benthic ecosystem health status based on a single biological community. In comparison with biological indicators, the score of chemical indicators is relatively low. DO, TLI and Igeo provide an essential supplement for the benthic ecosystem health assessment of lakes with eutrophication and heavy metal pollution problems. Using the new integrated assessment method, the benthic ecosystem health of Baiyangdian Lake was rated as fair, especially the northern parts of the lake adjacent to the inflow mouth of the Fu River, which were in poor condition, indicating that the lake has experienced anthropogenic disturbance, resulting in eutrophication, heavy metal pollution and biological community degradation. Whether it's spring or summer, the integrated assessment method provides a more plausible and comprehensive view of benthic ecosystem health under the pressure of increasing human activities and changing habitat and hydrological conditions, overcoming the narrow perspective and uncertainties of the single-index method. Thus, it can assist lake managers in providing technical support for ecological indication and restoration.																			0301-4797	1095-8630				JUN 1	2023	335								117530	10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.117530	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.117530		FEB 2023						36863150					WOS:000948962000001

The anomalous trough (ridge) of the eastward propagating wave train of the ISNAO pattern affects active (break) rainfall of SASRB and modulates the CISO of SASRB, together with the anomalous active (suppressed) convection northward propagating from the tropics and the subtropics. Moreover, the anomalous trough (ridge) around the Lake Baikal bridges the CISO in the mid-high latitudes and that of SASRB. The NCEP Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) depicts the spatial-temporal features, principal modes, and propagation of the CISO of SASRB reasonably well. However, the mean state of precipitation and the variance of CISO are overestimated. In the model, the ISNAO pattern is too weak and its fluctuating frequency is too high. Moreover, the CFSv2 only shows marginal skills in simulating the ISNAO pattern and the propagation of its associated wave trains, and underestimates the relationship between the atmospheric circulation in the mid-high latitudes and the CISO of SASRB. In addition, overestimation of the intensity of CISO in the tropical-subtropical and higher-latitude atmosphere may cause overestimation of the CISO of SASRB.					jiang, xingwen/AFK-0156-2022														0899-8418	1097-0088				SEP	2017	37	11					4119	4130		10.1002/joc.5033	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.5033													WOS:000409036800011

The resolution of our multi-proxy data was sufficiently high to enable the detection of millennial- and even centennial-scale climate change in the study area during the last deglacial transition. We found centennial-scale cold reversals between 14,650 and 12,900 cal yr BP, possibly corresponding to the Bolling-Allerod [BA] oscillations. Hanon pollen data implied that climate amelioration around 11,900 cal yr BP terminated the Younger Dryas [YD] in the study area and that a cold event around 11,300 cal yr BP probably correlated with the Pre-Boreal Oscillation [PBO] cooling event. Our results indicate that rising summer insolation and northward expanding low-latitudinal warm currents exerted a strong influence on climatological teleconnection via westerlies between the North Atlantic and the East Asian region during the last deglaciation, presumably causing a decoupling between temperature and East Asian Summer Monsoon [EASM] precipitation during the last deglaciation.

However, it is still unclear whether the trait-based functional classification can be applied to spring-type lakes. To understand the temporal and spatial characteristics of phytoplankton functional groups and their responses to environmental factors in spring-type urban lake in northern China, an investigation was conducted in Daming Lake from May 2020 to September 2021. The findings revealed the identification of 98 phytoplankton taxa belonging to 6 phyla, predominantly being Chlorophyta (39.8%), Bacillariophyta (35.7%) and Cyanophyta (15.3%). The dominant species were Microcystis sp., Merismopedia minima, Synedra acus and Scenedesmus quadricauda. These phytoplankton taxa were categorized into 21 functional groups, with 6 dominant functional groups (abbreviated as D, MP, P, J, Lo, and W1). Among them, the functional group D, primarily constituted by S. acus, exhibited absolute predominance. The seasonal succession sequence of the dominant functional groups was as follows: D/P/J/MP/ Lo ->-> D/P/W1/MP/Lo/J -> D/P/J -> D/MP -> D/P/MP. Throughout the investigation period, the trophic level index (TLI) ranged from 39.10 to 71.13, and the Q index was from 1.91 to 2.91, both indicating a medium health state for Daming Lake, which was consistent with the evaluation results of the diversity index. The results of redundancy analysis revealed that the main driving factors of phytoplankton FG biomass and composition were water temperature (WT), total nitrogen (TN), transparency (SD), TN:TP (N:P), redox potential (ORP), chemical oxygen demand (CODMn) and pH. The dominance of the functional group D positively correlated with water temperature, TN, CODMn, pH and N:P but negatively correlated with SD. It was observed that functional groups and the Q index can objectively indicate the seasonal succession of phytoplankton and the water quality status of Daming Lake. Our discoveries have significant implications for the comprehension of the effects of urbanization on phytoplankton dynamics and for enhancing lake management practices to foster sustainable urban development.

J	Walsh, JE				Walsh, JE			Long-term observations for monitoring of the cryosphere	CLIMATIC CHANGE					International Meeting of Experts on Long-Term Climate Monitoring by the Global Climate Observing System	JAN 09-11, 1995	ASHEVILLE, NC	WMO, UNESCO, Intergovt Oceanogr Commiss, UNEP, Int Council Sci Union				Variations of the cryosphere over decadal-to-century timescales are assessed by a survey of data on sea ice, snow cover, glaciers and ice sheets, permafrost and lake ice. The recent variations are generally consistent across the different cryospheric variables, especially when placed into the context of variations of temperature and precipitation. The recent warming over northern land areas has been accompanied by a decrease of snow cover, particularly during spring; the retreat of mountain glaciers is, in an aggregate sense, compatible with the observed warming; permafrost extent and lake ice duration show similar variations in areas for which data are available. Corresponding trends are not apparent, however, in data for some regions such as eastern Canada, nor in hemispheric sea ice data, especially for winter. The data also suggest an increase of snowfall over high latitudes, including the Antarctic ice sheet. Estimates of both the climatic and the statistical significance of the recent variations are hampered by data inhomogeneities, the shortness of the records of many variables and the absence of central archives for data on several variables. The potential of monitoring by satellite remote sensing has been realized with several variables (extent of sea ice, snow cover). Other cryospheric variables (snow depth, ice sheet elevation, lake ice, mountain glaciers) may be amenable to routine monitoring by satellites pending advances in instrumentation, modifications of satellite orbit, and further developments in signal detection algorithms. The survey of recent variations leads to recommendations concerning the use of historical data, in situ measurements, and remote sensing applications in the monitoring of the cryosphere.

Those contaminated suspended particles are dated to settle in the water column and will be further on its sediment. Lake Johanne, a shallow mesotrophic lake located in the SainteAnne-des-Lacs municipality in Quebec has been receiving wetland discharge water through the years. In this paper, onsite remediation of this water employing nonwoven geotextiles as filter media is investigated. The method was based on a tank near the lakeshore with a floating geotextile filtration system operated continuously (either with a 1-day or 0.5-day retention time). Wetland water was pumped into the tank, filtered by a selected non-woven geotextile combination with distinct apparent opening sizes, and returned to the lake by gravity. This experiment ran during the summer and mid-fall of 2022. Samples from both the inlet and tank were acquired every 2-3 days and filter media were changed upon clogging. Therefore, the study objective was to improve the discharge water quality before entering the lake. Water quality parameters evaluated on the deployment (i.e., from both inlet and tank) were total phosphorus, total organic carbon, total suspended solids (TSS), particle size, and turbidity. The onsite experiment provided an average attenuation of suspended particles, water cloudiness and nutrients around 25, 42, and 76% for total phosphorus, turbidity, and TSS parameters, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed remediation improved the water quality of the evaluated wetland water discharge, consequently, proving the feasibility of this possible remediation.																			2366-2557	2366-2565	978-3-031-61517-7; 978-3-031-61515-3; 978-3-031-61514-6				2024	502						271	283		10.1007/978-3-031-61515-3_22	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-61515-3_22													WOS:001355899400022

Taking Bosten Lake Basin in Northwest China as an example, the accuracy and the hydrological applicability of satellite-based precipitation datasets were evaluated. The gauge-adjusted version of six widely used datasets was adopted; namely, Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (CDR), Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS), Global Precipitation Measurement Ground Validation National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Prediction Center (NOAA CPC) Morphing Technique (CMORPH), Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM (GPM), Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP), the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA). Seven evaluation indexes were used to compare the station data and satellite datasets, the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model, and four indexes were used to evaluate the hydrological performance. The main results were as follows: 1) The GPM and CDR were the best datasets for the daily scale and monthly scale rainfall accuracy evaluations, respectively. 2) The performance of CDR and GPM was more stable than others at different locations in a watershed, and all datasets tended to perform better in the humid regions. 3) All datasets tended to perform better in the summer of a year, while the CDR and CHIRPS performed well in winter compare to other datasets. 4) The raw data of CDR and CMORPH performed better than others in monthly runoff simulations, especially CDR. 5) Integrating the hydrological performance of the uncorrected and corrected data, all datasets have the potential to provide valuable input data in hydrological modeling. This study is expected to provide a reference for the hydrological and meteorological application of satellite precipitation datasets in Central Asia or even the whole temperate zone.					; De Maeyer, Philippe/F-2985-2011; Kurban, Alishir/AGK-9193-2022	Kurban, Alishir/0000-0001-9387-8127; De Maeyer, Philippe/0000-0001-8902-3855; Bao, Anming/0000-0002-6221-7403														2072-4292				JAN	2021	13	2							221	10.3390/rs13020221	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13020221													WOS:000611554200001

Subfossil chironomid assemblages in deep, stratified European lakes: relationships with temperature, trophic state and oxygen	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P>1. The distributions of subfossil remains of chironomid larvae in 28 large, deep and stratified lakes in Europe were examined in surface sediments along a latitudinal transect ranging from northern Sweden to southern Italy. 2. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that summer surface water and July air temperature, as well as total phosphorus (TP) concentrations, hypolimnetic oxygen availability and conductivity were statistically significant (P < 0.05) explanatory variables explaining between 11 and 14% of the variance in the chironomid data. 3. Owing to the spatial scale covered by our study, many environmental variables were covarying. Temperature, TP concentration and oxygen availability were positively or negatively correlated with the first axis of a detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) of chironomid assemblages, suggesting that climatic and trophic conditions influenced profundal chironomid assemblages either in a direct (food and oxygen) or in an indirect (temperature) way. Parameters related to local environmental conditions, lake morphology and bedrock geology, such as organic matter content of the sediment, maximum lake depth, Secchi depth and pH, were not significant in explaining the distribution of chironomid assemblages in our study lakes. 4. The strong relationship between chironomid assemblages and summer temperature may be related to the covariation of temperature with parameters, such as nutrient and oxygen availability, known to affect chironomid assemblages in deep, stratified lakes. However, summer temperature explained a statistically significant proportion of the variance in the chironomid assemblages even when effects of oxygen availability and TP concentrations were partialled out. This suggests that summer temperature has an effect on chironomid assemblages in deep lakes, which is not related to its covariation with trophic state. 5. The potential of fossil chironomid analysis for quantitatively reconstructing past nutrient conditions in deep, stratified lakes was examined by calculating the Benthic Quality Index (BQI) based on subfossil chironomids and by comparing BQI values with observed TP concentrations. BQI was linearly related to log-transformed TP. Applying this relationship to fossil chironomid assemblages from Lake Paijanne (Finland) produced a TP reconstruction in agreement with measured TP during the period 1970-1990, demonstrating that this approach can provide quantitative estimates of past nutrient concentrations in deep, stratified lakes.					; Heiri, Oliver/JCE-4598-2023; Lotter, Andre/C-3477-2008; Lotter, Andre F./C-3477-2008	Heiri, Oliver/0000-0002-3957-5835; Verbruggen, Frederike/0000-0001-6642-8171; Lotter, Andre F./0000-0002-2954-8809													0046-5070	1365-2427				MAR	2011	56	3					407	423		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02508.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02508.x													WOS:000287092900001

THE ISOLATION OF INFLUENZA A VIRUS FROM PLUMAGE OF WATERFOWL DURING AUTUMN MIGRATION	SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT												Aim. In the present work we investigated the circulation of AIV in wild bird populations and studied the sorption of the influenza virus in the feathers of wild waterfowl nesting on reservoirs during the autumn mass migration. Material and methods. Sampling was carried out on the territory of the Novosibirsk region on Lake Chany during the period from August to September 2014-2016. Biological samples were collected from 188 wild waterfowl of various species. AIV isolation from cloacal swabs and swabs collected from feathers was carried out in the developing chick embryo system (RCC) as previously recommended. The isolated viruses were tested by HA/HI with specific sera, PCR analysis was carried out with subtyping primers. The genomes of the isolated viruses were sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. Results and discussion. As a result of monitoring, cloacal and feather swabs were collected from 188 individuals belonging to 13 species of the Anseriformes and Charadriiformes, whose representatives are the main natural reservoir of AIV. Fifteen new Al viruses were isolated from the collected samples. Four of them were isolated from plumage samples and the rate was more than 2 times lower, compared with virus isolation from cloacal swabs. Main conclusions.

The key role in AIV ecology may play the virus spreading by its adsorption on bird feathers.

Diatom and oxygen isotope analyses of the lake sediments confirm that the overall trend of climate change during the past 17,000 years was driven by precessional forcing, punctuated by abrupt shifts that may be linked to changes in Atlantic surface temperatures. The lake level was low from at least 17.2 to 16.2 cal kyr BP, and then rose between 16.2 and 15.2 cal kyr BP, which may represent a temporary reactivation of the monsoonal circulation system following its reduced activity during the Last Glacial Maximum. The lake was significantly low between 13.6 and similar to 11.8 cal kyr BP coinciding approximately with the Younger Dryas, but beginning 900 years before its recognised onset in the Greenland ice-core record. A major sedimentary hiatus, covering the interval 11.8 to 7.6 cal kyr BP, was probably caused by an early Holocene lowstand, the precise timing of which cannot be determined because pre-lowstand sediments were eroded from the core site. The lake filled to its overflow from 7.6 cal kyr BP until 5.6 cal kyr BR when the sediments record an abrupt lake response to the regional transition to and conditions that mark the end of African Humid Period. Evidence is also presented for climate changes which may have been associated with the rise and fall of Aksum. Ethiopia's first great civilisation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J	Budd, JW; Kerfoot, WC; Maclean, AL				Budd, JW; Kerfoot, WC; Maclean, AL			Documenting complex surface temperature patterns from advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) imagery of Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Interannual differences in nutrient concentrations, phytoplankton densities, and the dispersal of zooplankton and fish life history stages (e.g., planktonic larvae, resting eggs) in embayments often are contingent upon bay and coastal water exchange and movements. However predicting water mass exchange is difficult in that many factors influence the circulation of waters within bays. The central theme of this contribution is that circulation phenomena derived from simple models can be identified and classified using satellite-obtained lake surface temperature maps, and the incidence of events related to gross temperature regime (season) and winds (shorter-term perturbations). To illustrate this potential, the high sampling frequency of AVHRR imagery was used to examine seasonal surface temperature patterns between Saginaw Bay and Lake Huron over a 3-year period. Linear regressions of CoastWatch IMGMAP and OCNMAP daytime sea surface temperature (SST) algorithms against shipboard bulk temperatures were highly significant, with r(2) values of 0.98 and 0.94. Synoptic reconnaissance of lake surface temperatures from AVHRR verified many previously known general seasonal events, yet provided much better spatial coverage. The thermal bar persisted in the bay for approximately 6 weeks from late April until mid-June. The combination of shallow depths and impounded river discharges caused inner bay waters to warm more rapidly than outer bay and open lake waters. A thermal gradient of 6 to 10 degrees C persisted between the inner bay and Lake Huron waters throughout the summer. The persistence of major spatial thermal gradients restricted mixing of inner bay wafers with the enter bay and open lake, whereas inner and outer bay temperatures converged during fall months, increasing the likelihood of mixing. However, frequent wind-induced effects can cause circulation reversals and move surface waters in quire complex patterns across the bay. A VHRR image classification confirms the sensitivity of inner bay waters to wind stress-related circulation, aiding interpretations of historical data sets.																			0380-1330						1998	24	3					582	594		10.1016/S0380-1330(98)70846-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(98)70846-9													WOS:000076738000008
J	Haghighi, AT; Klove, B				Haghighi, Ali Torabi; Klove, Bjorn			Design of environmental flow regimes to maintain lakes and wetlands in regions with high seasonal irrigation demand	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												In arid regions, the construction of dams has led to an increase in irrigated agriculture, resulting in the desiccation of vulnerable lakes and wetlands. In many arid mountainous regions, such as in the Middle East, upstream dams typically feed rivers that flow into lowland terminal (closed) lakes or wetlands. The release of water for environmental purposes is a widely recognised option for reducing such impacts. The present study used monthly hydrological data from the Kor river in southern Iran, its main reservoirs and data above and below the Korbal irrigation system. The Kor river is a major source for feeding the Bakhtegan and Tashk lakes, which have recently started to disappear. An analysis of the water resource system before the dam construction (before 1973) showed that the monthly lake inflow depended on available water in river above the irrigation system (for eight months) and, during the irrigation season, water consumed for irrigation as well (for four months). However, in the post-development period (after 1997), the flow rate to the lake depended almost entirely on the Korbal irrigation system, except during some winter months when little irrigation was needed. Environment flow release has not been effective as it has led to greater water availability in the river, which results in more water being consumed for irrigation, as demonstrated here. To overcome this management mismatch, a new environmental flow release strategy (regime) was designed in which water is released from the upstream reservoirs during periods of low irrigation demand (e.g. winter months).

An accurate estimate of the ETa is essential for management of the water resources, agriculture, and irrigation, as well as research on atmospheric variations. Despite the importance of accurate ETa values, estimating and mapping them remains challenging due to the physical and biological complexity of the ET process. As a novel approach for rapid and reliable estimation of ETa, the present study develops automated deep learning (AutoDL) models that incorporate a metaheuristic optimization algorithm for image processing, architectural design, and hyper-parameter tuning. The proposed AutoDL models integrate three different spatial and channel attention mecha-nisms, including a novel activated spatial attention mechanism (ASPAM), with the U-Net architecture. Bypassing the need for meteorological inputs, the proposed framework uses Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) products and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data as inputs. To evaluate the performance of the models, they are applied to three study areas in the United States with various climatic characteristics. According to the results, during the spring and summer, when the target values have higher certainty, the estimations are highly promising, with R2 as high as 0.91 and MAPE as low as 6.40%. Furthermore, the proposed ASPAM module improves the accuracy of ETa estimations compared to attention gate (AG) and squeeze and excitation (SE) attention modules. The results also indicate that the MODIS raw products and derived vegetation and water indices can predict ETa within a reliable range of accuracy, with the addition of DEM data marginally enhancing the models' performance. The automatic workflow of this model makes it significantly easy to use, contributing to its applicability and generalizability for enhancing atmospheric research.

Understanding this phenomenon is crucial for the paleoenvironmental interpretation of the magnetic properties of lake sediments. In order to reveal its effects on sedimentary magnetic properties, and to assess the possible associated paleoenvironmental implications, we carried out detailed rock magnetic analyses of the selected samples from a 920-kyr lacustrine sequence from the Heqing Basin, SW China. The results indicate that the sedimentary magnetic properties are controlled by the concentration and grain size of magnetite and maghemite. High magnetic susceptibility (chi) intervals contain more fine-grained magnetite and maghemite, while low chi intervals contain only minor amounts of residual magnetite. The decreased content of fine-grained maghemite from high chi to low chi intervals reflects the dissolution of magnetic oxides during deposition. Intervals affected by strong magnetic dissolution have a high TOC content and correspond to times of high Antarctic temperatures, suggesting that magnetic mineral dissolution intensity was associated with variations in the strength of the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM). Notably, the ISM is sensitive to Southern Hemisphere warming. Weak magnetic dissolution indicates a dry climate occurred since similar to 320 kyr in the Heqing Basin. This dry/cool event was widespread across the Eastern Bay of Bengal, Equatorial Indian Ocean and Northern Australia, and was linked to a strengthened Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Since the moisture source of the Heqing Basin was mainly from the above regions, we infer that the influence of the IOD extended northwards to SW China.					; xu, xinwen/OEN-8727-2025	xu, xinwen/0000-0003-4826-8703; qiang, xiao ke/0000-0002-0014-2477													1367-9120	1878-5786				FEB	2020	188								104081	10.1016/j.jseaes.2019.104081	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jseaes.2019.104081													WOS:000509615200010

Here, we mainly review 240 recent relevant papers. Permafrost degradation has boosted groundwater storage and discharge to surface runoffs through improving hydraulic connectivity and reactivation of groundwater flow systems, resulting in reduced summer peaks, delayed autumn flow peaks, flattened annual hydrographs, and deepening and elongating flow paths. As a result of permafrost degradation, lowlands underlain by more continuous, colder, and thicker permafrost are getting wetter and uplands and mountain slopes, drier. However, additional contribution of melting ground ice to groundwater and stream-flows seems limited in most permafrost basins. As a result of permafrost degradation, the permafrost table and supra-permafrost water table are lowering; subaerial supra-permafrost taliks are forming; taliks are connecting and expanding; thermokarst activities are intensifying. These processes may profoundly impact on ecosystem structures and functions, terrestrial processes, surface and subsurface coupled flow systems, engineered infrastructures, and socioeconomic development. During the last 20 years, substantial and rapid progress has been made in many aspects in cryo-hydrogeology. However, these studies are still inadequate in desired spatiotemporal resolutions, multi-source data assimilation and integration, as well as cryo-hydrogeological modeling, particularly over rugged terrains in ice-rich, warm (>-1 degrees C) permafrost zones. Future research should be prioritized to the following aspects. First, we should better understand the concordant changes in processes, mechanisms, and trends for terrestrial processes, hydrometeorology, geocryology, hydrogeology, and ecohydrology in warm and thin permafrost regions. Second, we should aim towards revealing the physical and chemical mechanisms for the coupled processes of heat transfer and moisture migration in the vadose zone and expanding supra-permafrost taliks, towards the coupling of the hydrothermal dynamics of supra-, intra- and sub-permafrost waters, as well as that of water-resource changes and of hydrochemical and biogeochemical mechanisms for the coupled movements of solutes and pollutants in surface and subsurface waters as induced by warming and thawing permafrost. Third, we urgently need to establish and improve coupled predictive distributed cryo-hydrogeology models with optimized parameterization. In addition, we should also emphasize automatically, intelligently, and systematically monitoring, predicting, evaluating, and adapting to hydrogeological impacts from degrading permafrost at desired spatiotemporal scales. Systematic, in-depth, and predictive studies on and abilities for the hydrogeological impacts from degrading permafrost can greatly advance geocryology, cryo-hydrogeology, and cryo-ecohydrology and help better manage water, ecosystems, and land resources in permafrost regions in an adaptive and sustainable manner.					; Bense, Victor/AAH-3074-2020; Spektor, Valentin/J-9015-2018; Shepelev, Viktor/AAF-8768-2021; Luo, Dongliang/Q-9637-2016; li, xinyu/MXJ-9045-2025; Li, Xuguang/IQS-1141-2023	Huang, Yadong/0000-0003-3133-5607; Spektor, Valentin/0000-0002-7791-0972; Ma, Qiang/0000-0002-7477-1743; Liang, Sihai/0000-0003-0037-438X; Jin, Xiaoying/0000-0002-3831-5839; Bense, Victor/0000-0002-3675-5232; Marchenko, Sergey/0000-0003-3084-176X; 														2073-4441				FEB	2022	14	3							372	10.3390/w14030372	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14030372													WOS:000756368500001

Rapid and accurate flood mapping is essential for disaster monitoring and risk assessment. The normalized difference flood index (NDFI) is a change detection method with the characteristics of efficient processing and less manual intervention, which can quickly obtain flood information. However, the NDFI method would misclassify some permanent water bodies in lakes and rivers into floods. We presented a framework by combining NDFI calculated from synthetic aperture radar images and a summer permanent water bodies (SPWB) exclusion layer derived from optical remote sensing surface reflectance data, abbreviated as NDFI-SPWB. This framework was further verified by the flood event in the Yangtze river basin in July 2020. Results show that the NDFI-SPWB framework can increase the user accuracy by approximately 10% and the Kappa coefficient by approximately 0.08 compared with the original NDFI method, which verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Climate and food web effects on the spring clear-water phase in two north-temperate eutrophic lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Although climate change has shifted the phenological timing of plankton in lakes, few studies have explicitly addressed the relative contributions of climate change and other factors, including planktivory and nutrient availability. The spring clear-water phase is a period of marked reduction in algal biomass and increased water transparency observed in many lakes. Here, we quantified the phenological patterns in the start date, maximum date, duration, and magnitude of the clear-water phase over 38 yr in Lakes Mendota and Monona, and examined the effects of water temperature, total phosphorus, and food web structure (proportion of large-bodiedDaphnia pulicariaand density of invasiveBythotrephes) and interactions between temperature and other predictors on these clear-water phase metrics. We found that climate and food web structure affected the clear-water phase, but the effects differed among the metrics. Higher water temperature led to earlier clear-water phase start dates and maximum dates in both lakes. The proportion ofD. pulicariaaffected all clear-water phase metrics in both lakes. WhenD. pulicariaproportion was higher, the clear-water phase occurred earlier, lasted longer, and the water was clearer. Moreover, highBythotrephesdensity delayed clear-water phase start dates (both lakes), and decreased clear-water phase duration (Lake Mendota) in the following year. These results suggest that variation in food web structure changes the full phenological dynamics of the clear-water phase, while variation in climate condition affects clear-water phase timing only. Our findings highlight the importance of large-bodied grazers for managing water quality under climate change.					; Carpenter, Stephen/AAQ-6404-2020	Matsuzaki, Shin-ichiro/0000-0003-2744-1343; Stanley, Emily/0000-0003-4922-8121; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2021	66	1					30	46		10.1002/lno.11584	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11584		SEP 2020											WOS:000566567000001

J	Costelloe, JF; Russell, KL				Costelloe, Justin F.; Russell, Kathryn L.			Identifying conservation priorities for aquatic refugia in an arid zone, ephemeral catchment: a hydrological approach	ECOHYDROLOGY												The conservation priorities for protecting aquatic habitat of arid zone rivers requires an understanding of the drivers of distribution, characteristics and persistence of aquatic refugia in ephemeral to intermittent arid zone rivers. We describe and analyse the aquatic refugia that persist during drought periods in a large, arid, ephemeral river, the Neales River of central Australia, concentrating on refugia for fish and the hydrological processes that influence their location, characteristics and persistence. Field data were collected on flow events, water-level fluctuations in waterbodies during periods of no flow, waterbody dimensions and salinity. Modelling of open-water evaporation rates, analysis of salinity changes and frequency of flow events were used to investigate the main processes determining the persistence of waterbodies. The catchment contained both fluvial waterholes and artesian springs providing aquatic refugia. In addition, anthropogenic refugia, in the form of small dams situated on the floodplain and uncontrolled flow from artesian bores, also provided potential refuge. The catchment only contained one waterhole that had a cease-to-flow depth sufficient to persist over a no-flow period of 24months, but this would also dry within 24-30months. The capacity of the artesian springs to act as refugia is limited by their shallow depths and limited connectivity with the main river system. These data illustrate the vulnerability of the fluvial ecology of ephemeral, arid zone rivers to long-term droughts and water resource use and assist in identifying specific refugia that require conservation management.

Seeking the northern boundary of the Cascade strawberry	VIII INTERNATIONAL STRAWBERRY SYMPOSIUM	Acta Horticulturae				8th International Strawberry Symposium	AUG 13, 2016	Quebec City, CANADA	Int Soc Hort Sci				Fragaria cascadensis K.E. Hummer, an endemic decaploid strawberry species, was described from the Oregon Cascade Mountains in the Pacific North-western United States. Its range occurs near Mt. Hood, the highest peak in the northern Oregon Cascades, in a band of higher elevation sites southwards to near Crater Lake in southern Oregon. The objective of this study was to examine in more detail, the distribution of this species at the northern end of its range. During summer and fall 2015, several excursions were taken in the vicinity of Mt. Hood to seek the wild distribution of Fragaria species. These excursions encircled the mountain by road and hiking. The most northerly observation of the occurrence of F. cascadensis was at Lolo Pass near the junction of the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) and Route 18; the highest elevation occurrence was observed on Mt. Hood, 2 miles south of Timberline Lodge at 1589 m (5213'). Interestingly, the region to the east of the PCT and north of Hood, was populated with octoploid strawberries, Fragaria virginiana ssp. platypetala. This region included the Cooper Spur Recreational Area. The decaploid F. cascadensis was not observed in the north to northeast sector of the mountain. While the diploid F. vesca spp. bracteata (A. Heller) Staudt was present at the PCT at Cascade Locks near the Columbia River, no higher ploidy species were observed in that vicinity. Further research is ongoing regarding the distribution and phylogeny of the Cascade strawberry in Oregon.

Regardless of whether this technology is due to Acheulean population movements or to independent invention, however, one clear feature of these earlier sites is the significantly low lithic densities and infrequent numbers of Large Cutting Tools (LCTs) (e.g., for sites in the Bose Basin). Various hypotheses have been proposed to account for these low artefact densities. In this paper, we consider the interplay between cataclysmic events in the environment and population dynamics during the Acheulean in the Bose Basin, which has received little attention with regard to ecology. We focus on two sudden penecontemporaneous geological events at similar to 0.8 Ma: the Australasian tektite fall and the oldest Toba super-eruption, both of which have been well documented in Southeast Asia and the southern part of South China and have been confirmed as causing severe environmental change (e.g., deforestation). We propose that this destruction of the original habitat created a population bottleneck effect for the toolmakers, who very likely occupied the landscape at approximately the same time as the cataclysms.

J	Hindák, F; Kvíderová, J; Lukavsky, J				Hindak, Frantisek; Kviderova, Jana; Lukavsky, Jaromir			Growth characteristics of selected thermophilic strains of cyanobacteria using crossed gradients of temperature and light	BIOLOGIA												Growth requirements of 10 possibly thermophilic strains of cyanobacteria were compared under a wide spectrum of light and temperature conditions (7-80Wm(-2), 12-40A degrees C). The strains were isolated from different localities: six of thermal springs in Slovakia (4 from PieAyenany, 2 from Sklen, Teplice), one from thermal waters in Rupite, Bulgaria, 2 strains from a hypersaline lake Chott-el-Djerid, Tunisia, and one strain from the tropical island of Cebu, Philippines. Although the crossed gradient unit allowed only sub-optimal temperature range with respect to thermophile definition, i.e. optimum temperature above 45A degrees C, there were difference among the strains. The most thermophilic and high-light tolerant strain was Synechococcus bigranulatus strain Lukavsky 2005/66, with a peak above 45A degrees C; the second was Chroococcidiopsis thermalis strain Hindak 2008/9, and Isocystis sp. strain Hindak 2006/1. The temperature requirements of other strains were similar; the least thermophilic were both Slovakian strains of the genus Hapalosiphon. Growth was not limited below 80 W m(-2), except for H. fontinalis strain Hindak 2008/3, which prefers lower irradiance. Hapalosiphon delicatulus strain Hindak 2007/20, isolated from a bark tree on the tropical island of Cebu was rather mesophilic than thermophilic and shade-preferring. The CCA revealed that the ecologically similar strains originated from the same or nearby localities. There were no significant correlations between temperature optima in culture and in nature. Bulgarian and Tunisian strains preferred higher irradiances.					; Kviderova, Jana/B-1295-2009; Lukavský, Jaromír/H-1607-2014	lukavsky, jaromir/0000-0002-8939-4725; Kviderova, Jana/0000-0002-5700-477X													0006-3088					OCT	2013	68	5					830	837		10.2478/s11756-013-0215-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-013-0215-1													WOS:000323739200008

However, the variability, and especially underlying factors controlling CO 2 dynamics, across widespread hardwater lakes is poorly understood on the TP. Here, we present year-round records of surface water p CO 2 from a representative hardwater lake (Nam Co) on the TP, and analyze relationships between ambient variables and p CO 2 during open water (i.e., ice-free) and icecovered months. Surface p CO 2 (233.3 mu atm on average) was a little oversaturated to atmosphere (219 mu atm on average) during the open water season. As a CO 2 source, Nam Co emitted 8.73 +/- 1.06 Gg C annually, but this flux only accounted for 0.53 +/- 0.06 parts per thousand of its total dissolved inorganic carbon pool (1.64 x 10 13 g C). Regression results indicate that, during open water months, both seasonal and diurnal varying patterns of surface p CO 2 were influenced predominantly by water temperature, in a quasi-marine mode, by controlling gas solubility and dissolved carbonate equilibria. Therefore, CO 2 evasion was elevated during summer months, despite the lake being autotrophic (i.e., CO 2 consumption via photosynthesis). By contrast, during ice-covered months the surface p CO 2 was strongly related to under-ice thermodynamics, and declined nonlinear with increased inversed stratification. In the hypolimnion, as a result of extremely weak metabolism (as indicated by low dissolved oxygen depletion rates) and a combined high carbonate buffering effect, accumulation of CO 2 was negligible, leading to an absence of peak effluxes of CO 2 during turnover periods, compared to eutrophic freshwater lakes. We argue that, under future global warming scenarios, consideration of the impact of gradually warming lake water on thermodynamics and dissolved carbonate equilibria are vital in order to understand the future CO 2 dynamics of these widespread high-altitude oligotrophic-hardwater lakes situated across the TP.

Mean periphyton biomass was found to be higher than in 1962, when submerged plants were abundant. Periphyton development differed considerably between 2000 and 2001. Seasonal biomass minima occurred at different times in the two years due to phosphorus, silica and nitrogen limitation. Grazing was assumed to play a role in July. Periphyton was generally dominated by diatoms, whereas green algae became abundant with increasing water temperature in summer. 1-, 2-, and 2-20-week periphyton absorbed, on average, 19, 63, and 82% PAR, respectively. When combined with the attenuation of a 0.5 m water column these values increased to 60, 82 and 92% PAR, respectively. Minimum light requirements of submerged macrophytes are close to or higher than the remaining PAR, indicating that light limitation is an important factor for their growth in Lake Muggelsee. It was concluded that shading by periphyton shortens the clear-water phase with optimum growth conditions for the submerged plants. In combination with herbivorous activities of waterfowl and fish, periphyton shading prevents P. pectinatus plants from growing to the water surface to survive periods with low light availability during summer cyanobacteria blooms.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV 15	2003	506	1-3					525	530		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008560.73832.1c	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008560.73832.1c													WOS:000188455600070

Also, reservoir water was evaluated with water quality index (WQI). Damsa reservoir is significant for both biodiversity and recreation in the region. Except for the winter season, the lake water is of good quality for WQI. There is pollution in the lake in terms of phosphorus, especially for winter. In terms of phosphate, all of the stations are mezotrophic for the OECD; however, Stations 4 and 5 are eutrophic for the T & uuml;rkiye Surface Water Quality Management Regulation (the others are mezotrophic). Community variation and status of benthic macroinvertebrate were evaluated with Ecological Status Class Assessment Tools (ESCATs) indices which have been widely used in the literature. In the present study, 1062 individual benthic macroinvertebrates from 11 orders and 17 families were collected. A total of 46 macroinvertebrates taxa were identified. The first three dominant groups are Oligochaeta (42.66%), Hemiptera (Micronecta scholtzi, 23.07%) and Chironomidae (19.67%).

A major part of the community production was contributed by epiphytic and planktonic microalgae. The macroalgae had wide year-to-year variation in zonation and productivity, primarily due to differences in underwater light climate and water currents. Photosynthesis by Nitella became light saturated at 150-mu-E m-2 s-1, a much lower level than for epiphytic diatoms. Consequently, higher transparency of the water increased the growth of epiphytes and hence suppressed the growth of macroalgae in the shallower parts of the littoral zone. Secondary production of macrofauna (> 200-mu-m) within the Nitella beds (1-2 g C m-2 yr-1) was relatively low and primarily sustained by the microalgal production. Threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus L., average density 10 ind m-2) were of major importance in controlling the invertebrates (cladocerans. copepods, ostracods, chironomid larvae) within the Nitella beds. With respect to nutrient cycling in the lake, the macroalgal beds could be of great importance in functioning as effective traps for suspended algal and detrital material, as well as for nutrients and CO2 transported by water currents. Conversely, through decomposition and mineralization the macroalgal detritus could provide a good substrate for the macro- and microalgal growth of the following spring and summer.																			0030-1299					MAY-JUN	1992	64	1-2					241	256		10.2307/3545054	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3545054													WOS:A1992JG50900017

During inundation, fish migrate into floodplain forests to feed on fruits and seeds, in an area more than 300 000 km(2) in size. To document patterns of species diversity, distribution, abundance and temporal dynamics and in order to describe the ecological importance of the inundated forest, floodplain fish were captured using variously sized gill nets in white and black water areas inside and outside the floodplain forests during low, rising, high and falling water level in 1990 and 1991. Dominance varies to some extent in white water between floodplain forest (0.06) and open water (0.11) while it is unchanged in black water (0.04). Black water fish communities were more diverse. Most abundant among white water fish were Liposarcus pardalis, Pygocentrus nattereri, and Pellona flavipinnis, for example, or Plagioscion squamsissimus, Serrasalmus rhombeus, and Serrasalmus manueli in black water. Among the most abundant white water fish, Colossoma macropomum, Mylossoma duriventre and Osteoglossum bicirrhosum occurred almost exclusively in inundated forests. Of the black water species there were a large number of species which were captured only in inundated forest, such as Geophagus cf. altifrons, Hoplias malabaricus, Osteoglossum bicirrhosum and Uaru amphiacanthoides. Catches varied with sample site, water level and direction of water level change. The average CPUE in white and black water was 190 and 41 g fish m(-)2 and day, respectively, with maximum yields at low water and minimum yields at high water. Comparing rising and falling water levels, a significantly higher quantity of fishes was captured at falling water level. In black water, fish catches from the floodplain forest exceeded the open water catch by 183 to 550%, depending on season. Differences in respect of white water are smaller (106-281%). Fish communities in the area under investigation seem to be stochastically assembled, with significant differences between white and black water only. Many fishes move into the floodplain forest not only to feed but probably also for other reasons - to seek shelter, for example.

J	TRAVERSE, A				TRAVERSE, A			ORGANIC FLUVIAL SEDIMENT - PALYNOMORPHS AND PALYNODEBRIS IN THE LOWER TRINITY RIVER, TEXAS	ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN												In 1961-1962, the author studied the lower Trinity River, Texas, for palynomorph content, as a model of how pollen, spores, and palynodebris reach depositional areas for incorporation in sedimentary rocks. The river was selected partly because it was at that time relatively undisturbed by industry and damming. Three stations were selected for surface and mid-depth water sample collection, 00 in Trinity Bay, 04 on the Trinity River delta, and 09 on the lower Trinity River. Palynomorph loads at 04 and 09 were especially high, often reaching 10(5) or more per 100 liters of water. Water of the bay station usually contained much lower concentrations of palynomorphs. A wide range of pollen and spore types occurred in the water, dominated by major floral elements of the lower Trinity River area, but including forms from farther upstream. Reworked pollen and spores, eroded from rocks hundreds of kilometers north and northwest of the sampling localities, were regularly recovered. Engelhardia/Momipites-type pollen of Paleogene age was an especially significant reworked form. There were seasonal changes in the composition of the palynoflora, reflecting flowering peaks such as that of Taxodium (swamp cypress) in late winter and Poaceae (grass) in summer. In 1985-1986, the same stations were once again sampled. Since the earlier sampling, damming upstream had created Lake Livingston, which acts as a huge settling basin, resulting in decreased palynomorph load in the water at all stations in the lower river. Fungal spores as well as pollen apparently have been reduced in concentration. A sampling in 1986 of the lake itself and of the river at its inlet tends to confirm that the lake acts as a settling basin for waterborne palynomorphs. Rivers deliver a sampling of the terrestrial flora, via palynomorphs and palynodebris. to the continental shelf. In total, this particulate organic matter is an important part of the earth's budget of buried carbon. Studies of the palynomorph-palynodebris load of streams therefore contribute to understanding the origin and fate of organic matter in sedimentary rocks.																			0026-6493						1992	79	1					110	125		10.2307/2399813	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2399813													WOS:A1992HD32500010

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the habitat suitability of herbivorous Anseriformes of China's Poyang Lake. Landsat images with a resolution of 30 m downloaded from the United States Geological Survey, and other ancillary data were used. The ENVI 5.3 software and ArcGIS 10.2 software were used for preprocessing, classifying the satellite image, and mapping habitat suitability. The study reveals that land cover types were divided into vegetation, mudflats, water, and sand. Similarly, the study area's habitats were also divided into unsuitable, fair, good, and best grades. However, the distribution of the habitat suitability for each grade reveals significant spatial variations. For instance, vegetation indicated the areas with the best habitat grade, followed by mudflats, and these areas cover (47.93%, 2015 and 55.78%, 2019) the majority of the study area. The unsuitable grades cover the smallest areas (0.48%) of the lake. Similarly, this study results showed a slight change in habitat suitability areas. Therefore, this study highlighted that Poyang Lake has valuable importance for the conservation of herbivorous Anseriformes. Extending the years of study and including some ecological variables from different stopovers could improve the results.					; Omeno, Opelele/HJI-8444-2023; Debela, Megersa/AAM-3869-2021	Tsegaye, Megersa/0000-0003-0333-9053; 														1424-2818				APR	2021	13	4							171	10.3390/d13040171	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d13040171													WOS:000642983700001

This population was initially considered to have been introduced from other sites within the region. Its significant and unique genetic variability (high microsatellite and mtDNA polymorphism, highly significant F,, values and the presence of private alleles) indicate however that it is an entirely new and formerly unknown natural population that had escaped earlier studies of this species. This natural population, that represents a significant genetic resource, is threatened by extensive human encroachment of the Loboi Swamp. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Pesticide use in the wheat-maize double cropping systems of the North China Plain: Assessment, field study, and implications	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In the North China Plain (NCP), rising inputs of pesticides have intensified the environmental impact of farming activities in recent decades by contributing to surface water and groundwater contamination. In response to this, the Chinese government imposed stricter regulations on pesticide approval and application, and better monitoring strategies are being developed. However, sufficient and well-directed research on the accumulation and impact of different pesticides is needed for informed decision-making. In this study, current pesticide use, and recent and current research on water contamination by pesticides in the NCP are reviewed and assessed. Additionally, a small-scale field study was performed to determine if residuals fromcurrently-used pesticides in the NCP can be detected in surface water, and in connected shallow groundwater. The contaminants of interest were commonly used pesticides on winter wheat-summer maize fields (the dominant cropping system in the NCP), such as 2,4-D and atrazine. Sampling took place in May, July, and October 2013; and March 2014. Results from our literature research showed that sampling is biased towards surface water monitoring. Furthermore, most studies focus on organic chlorinated pesticides (OCPs) like the isomers of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), which were banned in China in 1983. However, currently-used herbicides like 2,4-D and atrazine were detected in river water and groundwater in all samplings of our field study. The highest concentrations of 2,4-D and atrazine were found in the river water, ranging up to 3.00 and 0.96 mu g/L, respectively. The monitoring of banned compounds was found to be important because several studies indicate that they are still accumulating in the environment and/or are still illegally in use. However, supported by our own data, we find that themonitoring in groundwater and surfacewater of currently permitted pesticides in China needs equal attention, and should therefore be increased.

Anthropogenic pressures, however, in the form of forest degradation, reckless use of fertilizers and pesticides, land system changes and unplanned settlements are diminishing pristine basin water quality, which necessitates better understanding of pollution variability and its sources. Extensive field sampling across major tributaries and along main river course was carried out during the year 2017-18. Pattern recognition techniques like Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA), Wilk's lambda. quotient, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were applied to a huge dataset comprising of 5192 observations. Spatially, three clusters correspond to low pollution headwater streams (cluster 1), moderately polluted middle and downstream sites (cluster 2) and high polluted main river course sites (cluster 3). This is also supported by ANOVA results, manifesting significantly higher concentrations of total hardness (TH), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), chloride (Cl), total alkalinity (TA), nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), total phosphorus (TP), iron (Fe) and total coliform (TC) in high pollution associated cluster (cluster 3) followed by cluster 2 and minimum quantities were observed in cluster 1. Observations on seasonal water quality either did not fluctuate considerably or differs significantly during summers only, except water temperature (WT), which exhibits significant difference in all seasonal clusters. Wilk's lambda. quotient distribution revealed that only WT was main contributor in the formation of seasonal clusters. PCA recognized five underlying factors in the data structure and explained about 72% of total variance. Maximum variance (22.66%) is explained by combination of ionic salt group (natural source) and TC (anthropogenic source) followed by dissolved ions (19.20%) causing hardness and buffering of waters, nutrient sources (15.08%) from human and agriculture wastes, gradient factor (7.87%) allied with small fall in dissolved oxygen (DO) downwards and pH (7.11%) linked with hydrolysis of acidic material accrued from organic matter. The water quality index (WQI) was mostly influenced by coliform bacterial count and pH with highest mean effective weights of 39.15% and 26.65% respectively. Evaluation of the water suitability for drinking purpose reveals that the Jhelum River Basin has mostly retained excellent water quality (66% of data points) but poses safety concerns in downstream segments due to anthropogenic signatures.

Lakes can demonstrate incomplete drainage, where residual melt can become buried under ice and snow and survive throughout the winter. We evaluate atmospheric factors that influence the propensity for the formation of buried lakes over the ice sheet. We examine the spatial and temporal occurrence and behavior of buried lakes over the Jakobshavn Isbrae and Zachariae Isstrom outlet basins and assess the magnitude of insolation necessary to preserve melt water using a numerical lake model from 2009 to 2012. Buried lakes tend to occur at higher elevations within the ablation zone and those present at elevations > 1000 m tend to reoccur over several seasons. Lakes without buried water are relatively small (similar to 1 km(2)), whereas lakes with buried water are larger (similar to 6-10 km(2)). Lake area is correlated with the number of seasons sub-surface water persists. Buried lakes are relatively deep and associated with complex supraglacial channel networks. Winter stored water could be a precursor to the formation of supraglacial channels. Simulations of the insulation potential of accumulated snow and ice on the surface of lakes indicate substantial regional differences and inter-annual variability. With the possibility of inland migration of supraglacial lakes, buried lakes could be important in the evolution of ablation/percolation zone hydrology.

The first preconcentration step was the adsorption of Pb(II) on Amberlite CG-120 resin in the drinking, spring and lake water samples before detection and then its elution using 5 mL of 3 M nitric acid. The second preconcentration step was conducted using SQT device with flame atomic absorption detection. Using a two-step preconcentration method, enrichment factor of 560 was found and detection and quantitation limits were 0.23 and 0.8 mu g/L, respectively. The accuracy of the method was tested by analysis of standard reference material (Environmental Matrix Reference Material, Lake Water, TMDA-70.2) at a 95% confidence level.

REPRODUCTIVE DEMOGRAPHY OF TWO CLOSELY RELATED EMYDINE TURTLES IN A SPRING FED SYSTEM	SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST												Freshwater turtles are appropriate organisms for studying maternal investment in offspring because, unlike most long-lived vertebrates, turtles show high fecundities and most provide no parental care. We studied reproductive patterns of two emydine freshwater turtle species, the Texas river cooter (Pseudemys texana) and the red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans) at Spring Lake, Hays County, Texas during the 2009 nesting season. Forty-six percent of all nesting Texas river cooters and 25% of all nesting red-eared sliders nested twice, with some Texas river cooters nesting more than twice. Mean egg mass, egg length, and egg width decreased in subsequent clutches in Texas river cooters. However, there was an insufficient sample size of subsequent clutches (n = 6) to draw conclusions for red-eared sliders. Red-eared sliders did not show a positive relationship between clutch size and body size. We found that in both species there was a positive relationship between egg width and egg mass in relation to maternal body size. However, only Texas river cooters showed a positive relationship between clutch size and maternal size, while only red-eared sliders showed a positive relationship between egg length and maternal size. By comparing reproductive parameters of these two coexisting populations, we concluded that the members of these two species allocate resources differently for reproduction.																			0038-4909	1943-6262				SEP	2014	59	3					325	330																WOS:000209734600002
J	Wang, CX; Xia, SX; Yu, XB; Wen, L				Wang, Chenxi; Xia, Shaoxia; Yu, Xiubo; Wen, Li			Responses to extreme drought in wintering waterbirds: a multi-species approach	FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY												BackgroundClimate change and anthropogenic activities are accelerating environmental changes, challenging wild animals' survival. Behavioral plasticity, such as adjusting habitat selection and foraging activity, is a key mechanism for responding to rapid environmental changes in the Anthropocene era. However, this shift may expose animals to new challenges. Moreover, not all behavioral plasticity is adaptive, as evidenced by ecological traps. This study focuses on Poyang Lake, a Ramsar wetland and a critical wintering ground for waterbirds in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. Historically, the migratory patterns of waterbirds were synchronized with the plant life cycle. However, recent hydrological regime changes have diminished suitable habitats and food resources, thereby posing significant conservation challenges for waterbirds.MethodsUtilizing multiyear satellite tracking data, we examined the variations in wintering home range and behaviors of four herbivorous waterbird species between natural and artificial wetlands in Poyang Lake under different hydrological conditions.ResultsOur results reveal significant differences in home range area and movement speed among species and across hydrological years. All species demonstrated a marked increase in their use of artificial wetlands under unfavorable conditions. Specifically, the Greater White-fronted Goose (Anser albifrons) shifted its distribution to artificial wetlands during drought years while favoring natural wetlands under normal conditions, indicating a stress-induced adaptation. In contrast, the Bean Goose (A. fabalis) and Swan Goose (A. cygnoid) displayed greater behavioral plasticity. Notably, the Siberian Crane (Leucogeranus leucogeranus) increasingly used artificial wetlands, likely due to human protection, raising concerns about potential ecological traps. Additionally, waterbirds foraging in artificial wetlands generally exhibited higher movement speeds during drought conditions. This behavior suggests maladaptation and a more dispersed distribution.ConclusionsOur study underscored the critical role of artificial wetlands in supporting migratory waterbirds during drought, though elevated movement speeds observed in these habitats suggest potential maladaptation. Species-specific responses raise concerns about ecological traps if these habitats fail to meet key ecological needs. To ensure long-term conservation, efforts should focus on preserving natural wetlands and enhancing the quality of artificial habitats. Future research should prioritize long-term monitoring to guide habitat management and address species-specific needs in the face of climate change and habitat degradation.

J	Strong, EE; Gargominy, O; Ponder, WF; Bouchet, P				Strong, Ellen E.; Gargominy, Olivier; Ponder, Winston F.; Bouchet, Philippe			Global diversity of gastropods (Gastropoda; Mollusca) in freshwater	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The world's gastropod fauna from continental waters comprises similar to 4,000 valid described species and a minimum of 33-38 independent lineages of Recent Neritimorpha, Caenogastropoda and Heterobranchia (including the Pulmonata). The caenogastropod component dominates in terms of species richness and diversity of morphology, physiology, life and reproductive modes and has produced several highly speciose endemic radiations. Ancient oligotrophic lakes (e.g., Baikal, Ohrid, Tanganyika) are key hotspots of gastropod diversity; also noteworthy are a number of lower river basins (e.g., Congo, Mekong, Mobile Bay). But unlike many other invertebrates, small streams, springs and groundwater systems have produced the most speciose associations of freshwater gastropods. Despite their ecological importance in many aquatic ecosystems, understanding of even their systematics is discouragingly incomplete. The world's freshwater gastropod fauna faces unprecedented threats from habitat loss and degradation and introduced fishes and other pests. Unsustainable use of ground water, landscape modification and stock damage are destroying many streams and springs in rural/pastoral areas, and pose the most significant threats to the large diversity of narrow range endemics in springs and ground water. Despite comprising only similar to 5% of the world's gastropod fauna, freshwater gastropods account for similar to 20% of recorded mollusc extinctions. However, the status of the great majority of taxa is unknown, a situation that is exacerbated by a lack of experts and critical baseline data relating to distribution, abundance, basic life history, physiology, morphology and diet. Thus, the already considerable magnitude of extinction and high levels of threat indicated by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is certainly a significant underestimate.

J	Kashulin, N; Kashulina, T; Bekkelund, A				Kashulin, Nikolay; Kashulina, Tatiana; Bekkelund, Alexander			Long-Term Eutrophication and Dynamics of Bloom-Forming Microbial Communities during Summer HAB in Large Arctic Lake	ENVIRONMENTS												Harmful algal blooms (HABs) in arctic lakes are recent phenomena. In our study, we performed a long-term analysis (1990-2017) of the eutrophication of Lake Imandra, a large subarctic lake, and explored the biodiversity of bloom-forming microorganisms of a 2017 summer HAB. We performed a 16Sr rRNA metabarcoding study of microbial communities, analysed the associations between N, P, C, and chlorophyll concentrations in the lake water, and developed models for the prediction of HABs based on total P concentration. We have demonstrated that blooms in Lake Imandra occur outside of optimal Redfield ratios and have a nonlinear association with P concentrations. We found that recent summer HABs in a lake occur as simultaneous blooms of a diatom Aulacoseira sp. and cyanobacteria Dolichospermum sp. We have studied the temporal dynamics of microbial communities during the bloom and performed an analysis of the publicly available Dolichospermum genomes to outline potential genetic mechanisms beneath simultaneous blooming. We found genetic traits requisite for diatom-diazotroph associations, which may lay beneath the simultaneous blooming of Aulacoseira sp. and Dolichospermum sp. in Lake Imandra. Both groups of organisms have the ability to store nutrients and form a dormant stage. All of these factors will ensure the further development of the HABs in Lake Imandra and the dispersal of these bloom-forming species to neighboring lakes.

J	Anderson, PM; Lozhkin, AV; Brubaker, LB				Anderson, PM; Lozhkin, AV; Brubaker, LB			A lacustrine pollen retard from north Priokhot'ya: New information about late Quaternary vegetational variations in western Beringia	ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												A pollen record from Glukhoye Lake (59 degrees 45'N 149 degrees 55'E; elevation 2.8 m a.s.l.) describes the late Quaternary vegetation history of the northern coastal region of the Okhotsk Sea. Although lacking radiocarbon dates, a tentative age scheme for the core is offered on the basis of other dated pollen stratigraphies and tephrochronology. The full-glacial pollen assemblage from Glukhoye Lake differs from other western Beringian spectra in that it has low percentages of Cyperaceae (<5%) pollen and Selaginella rupestris (<1%) spores, high percentages of Poaceae (>40%) and Asteraceae (5-20%) pollen, and low to moderate percentages of Artemisia (5-35%) pollen. This unique assemblage suggests that several types of herb-dominated communities characterized the full-glacial landscape of western Beringia. Herb tundra is replaced by shrub tundra as Betula followed by Alnus and Pinus colonized near the lake. Larix is the last major taxon of the modem vegetation to appear in the Glukhoye record. In contrast to the interior Upper Kolyma region, Pinus apparently established prior to Larix near the coast and experienced significant population fluctuations during the mid- to late Holocene. Reasons for the variability in the vegetation history between these two regions can probably be linked to differences in fall/early winter snow conditions and mean July temperatures. Today strong temperature and precipitation gradients characterize the transition from the northern Okhotsk Sea coast to the mountainous interior of the Upper Kolyma region. The Glukhoye and Upper Kolyma pollen records suggest that the Okhotsk Sea and coastal ranges have been important influences on the regional climates of southwestern Beringia throughout the Holocene.																			0004-0851					FEB	1996	28	1					93	98		10.2307/1552090	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1552090													WOS:A1996TZ75900011

Fish diversity was low (11 sp.) and experimental gill net catches were highly variable between sites in the estuary and coastal waters, and also seasonally at a given site. During summer, the estuarine fishes were numerically dominated by two marine species, the fourhorn sculpin, Myoxocephalus quadricornis, and the slender eelblenny, Lumpenus fabricii, and also by juvenile cisco, Coregonus artedii, and juvenile lake whitefish, C. clupeaformis. In coastal waters, three marine species were abundant: the shorthorn sculpin, M. scorpius, the arctic sculpin, M. scorpioides and the Greenland cod, Gadus ogac. In contrast with the estuary, large (> 270 mm) cisco and lake whitefish were abundant in coastal waters indicating extensive movements of these species in James Bay during the summer. Distribution patterns were influenced by a combination of physical conditions (salinity and temperature) and biological characteristics (habitat choice, migration and reproduction) depending on the season.
