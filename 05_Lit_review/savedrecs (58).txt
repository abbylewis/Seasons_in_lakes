J	Guhl, BE; Finlay, BJ; Schink, B				Guhl, BE; Finlay, BJ; Schink, B			Comparison of ciliate communities in the anoxic hypolimnia of three lakes: General features and the influence of lake characteristics	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The ciliate communities and their food sources were investigated in the anoxic hypolimnia of three lakes with differing water chemistry. Bacterial biomass and, as a result, the biomass of bacterivorous ciliates were correlated with lake trophy. Additionally, high sulfate and sulfide concentrations led to high bacterial biomass of sulfate reducers and anaerobic phototrophic and heterotrophic bacteria, which in turn sustained large ciliate populations. The anaerobic ciliate communities of the lakes shared many characteristics. They were comprised of the same or closely related species: this was attributed to a low diversity of food sources. Ciliate to prey biomass ratios were 1.2-3.8% which is consistent with a low theoretical growth efficiency of anaerobic metabolism. Grazing pressure on anaerobic ciliates by metazoa was insignificant. In all three lakes, ciliate populations showed distinct vertical non-random distribution patterns which were often correlated with the distribution of the corresponding food sources. It is suggested that the microbial communities in anoxic water bodies are largely influenced by few common environmental conditions and are therefore often inhabited by similarly structured ciliate communities.																			0142-7873					MAR	1996	18	3					335	353		10.1093/plankt/18.3.335	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/18.3.335													WOS:A1996TZ27200003

Often little consideration is given to the impact of additional transport characteristics on contaminant sampling error and design. Detalied examination of five transport characteristics at a single river cross-section emphasizes the importance of understanding the complete transport/loading regime of a sampling station, defining the required end products of the monitoring program, and defining the accuracy required to meet specific program needs before implementing or evaluating a monitoring program. River transport characteristics examined are (a) contaminant transport modes, (b) short-term temporal and seasonal variability, (c) the relationship between dissolved and particulate contaminant concentrations and discharge, (d) toad distribution with sediment particle size, and (e) spatial variability in a cross-section.																			0013-936X					JAN	1995	29	1					161	170		10.1021/es00001a021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es00001a021								22200215					WOS:A1995PZ72300047

We measured plant community composition and structural characteristics in three replicated disturbance treatments and in mature sand pine forest (MF). Treatments were: (1) high-intensity burn, salvage logged and naturally regenerated (HIBS); (2) clear-cut, roller-chopped, and broadcast-seeded (RC); and (3) clear-cut and bracke-seeded (BK). All treatments were sampled 5-7 yr postdisturbance. Nonwoody plant species richness and diversity were significantly lower in MF than in disturbance treatments. Ruderal species were more abundant in HIBS and RC, but not to the exclusion of the characteristic suite of native scrub species. Shrub richness and diversity did not differ, but some species responded differently among treatments. Differences may be due to season of disturbance or rhizome depth [e.g., Serenoa repens (Bartr.) Small vs. Sabal etonia Swingle ex Nash.]. Oak stem density was significantly lower in HIBS and RC. Most structural characteristics were similar in HIBS, RC and BM but differed from MF. Results suggest that many scrub species responded similarly to aboveground biomass removal and the consequent structural and microclimatic conditions across these disturbance types. We suggest that plant resiliency traits, which evolved in response to the selective pressures of high-intensity disturbance and harsh environmental conditions, confer resiliency to human-caused disturbance as well. Mechanical biomass removal may be a suitable ecosystem management practice where burning is impractical. Due to the absence of a ''virgin'' (unsalvaged) burn treatment or pretreatment data and the short-term scope of this study, interpretation of results should be made with caution.																			0003-0031					JAN	1995	133	1					149	163		10.2307/2426356	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2426356													WOS:A1995QD90800015

Based on historical sediment data, Moonshine Bay served as the low contaminant exposure site, Water Conservation Area 3A served as an intermediate contaminant exposure site, and Belle Glade served as the high contaminate exposure site. In May 1999, alligators (n = 22) from Water Conservation Area 3A exhibited higher T, concentrations than animals from both Belle Glade (n = 22; p = 0.0003) and Moonshine Bay (n = 33; p = 0.001). In May 2000, alligators (n = 29) Water Conservation Area 3A again exhibited higher T, concentrations than those from Belle Glade (n = 49; p = 0.02) but not those from Moonshine Bay (n = 40). No sexual dimorphism was observed among mean T-4 concentrations within any of the sites during either year (p > 0.05). Animals within all sites exhibited higher T-4 concentrations in May 2000 when compared to May 1999. When variance was examined, animals from Water Conservation Area 3A exhibited higher variance in plasma T-4 concentrations than those from either Moonshine Bay or Belle Glade. We concluded that mean plasma T-4 concentrations did not match the sediment contaminant mixture data presently available to us, whereas variance seems to be a more reliable indicator of contaminant exposure.

Leaf area index (LAI) calculated from litterfall ranged from 6.0 to 8.0 in 1988, from 4.9 to 7.9 in 1989, and from 5.3 to 7.8 in 1990. The data suggest that maximum LAI for the sites is between 7 and 8. Insect defoliation and the allocation of assimilates to reproductive parts in large seed years reduced LAI by up to 34%. Allometric equations for leaf area and foliar biomass were not significantly different among sites. They predicted higher LAI values than were estimated from litterfall and could not account for the influences of defoliation and seed production. Canopy transmittance was a viable alternative for estimating LAI. Extinction coefficients (K) of 0.49 to 0.65 were appropriate for solar elevations of 63-degrees to 41-degrees. Patterns of specific leaf area (SLA) were similar for the sites. Average sugar maple SLA increased from 147 cm2 g-1 in the upper 5 m of the canopy to 389 cm2 g-1 in the seedling layer. Litterfall SLA averaged 196 cm2 g-1 for all species and 192 cm2 g-1 for sugar maple. Similarity among the sites in allometric relationships, maximum LAI, canopy transmittance, and patterns of SLA suggests these characteristics were controlled primarily by the similar nutrient and moisture availability at the sites. A general increasing trend in litter production along the gradient could not be attributed to N deposition or length of growing season due to year to year variability resulting from insect defoliation and seed production.																			0015-749X					SEP	1991	37	4					1041	1059																WOS:A1991GE52700006
J	Sin, Y; Wetzel, RL; Lee, BG; Kang, YH				Sin, Yongsik; Wetzel, Richard L.; Lee, Byeong-Gweon; Kang, Yun Ho			Integrative ecosystem analyses of phytoplankton dynamics in the York River estuary (USA)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The relative importance of biotic (top-down) vs. abiotic (bottom-up) controls on phytoplankton dynamics was investigated in the York River estuary, Virginia (USA) by a combination of extensive analyses of long-term data sets collected by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) monitoring program over 17 years (1984-2001), field studies (1996-1997) and ecosystem modeling analyses. Results from the analysis of long-term data records collected at three stations along the salinity gradient suggested that phytoplankton are more likely controlled by abiotic mechanisms such as resource limitation than biotic mechanisms such as grazing since annual cycles of primary production and phytoplankton biomass were similar and no grazing effects were evident based on the observed relationship between phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass (R-2 < 0.2, p > 0.1). This scenario was supported by short-term field observations made over an annual cycle at three stations in the mid-channel of the estuary where both chlorophyll a and primary production demonstrated similar patterns of seasonal variation. Ratios of fluorescence before and after acidification at all study sites were relatively high suggesting low grazing pressure in the estuary. A tidally-averaged, size-structured plankton ecosystem model was previously developed and verified for the lower York River estuary. The validated ecosystem model was also used to examine this issue and simulation results supported the importance of bottom-up control in the York River estuary.					; Sin, Yongsik/AFH-4920-2022	Sin, Yongsik/0000-0002-9986-4532; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2006	571						93	108		10.1007/s10750-006-0232-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0232-y													WOS:000240308500007
J	Daly, RG; Gastaldo, RA				Daly, Rachel G.; Gastaldo, Robert A.			THE EFFECT OF LEAF ORIENTATION TO SUNLIGHT ON STOMATAL PARAMETERS OF QUERCUS RUBRA AROUND THE BELGRADE LAKES, CENTRAL MAINE	PALAIOS												Stomatal frequencies of fossil-plant species are used to estimate past pCO(2) levels based on the physiological functions of living taxa. There is a demonstrable inverse relationship between increasing pCO(2) and stomatal frequency parameters, in which there is a decrease in both stomatal density (SD) and stomatal index (SI). Concentration of CO2 is not the only factor known to affect SD and SI values, which are a product of leaf development and expansion, as studies have shown a positive correlation between SD and light intensity. The present study tests the hypothesis that SD and SI are not influenced by a leaf's physical orientation relative to the sun during the growing season. Sun leaves of northern red oak, Quercus rubra, were collected from trees around the margins of six lakes of the Belgrade Lakes Region, central Maine, United States, in 2007. Lakes in NE-SW, NW-SE, and E-W orientations allowed for sampling of trees exposed to varying light intensities throughout the growing-season day. The SD and SI of each tree were calculated, and statistical comparisons were made between populations exposed to predominant morning or afternoon light intensities for each lake and between populations on lakes of differing orientations. There is no statistically significant difference in either SD or SI between populations growing under different orientations to growing-season sunlight. These data indicate that exposure to various sunlight regimes on opposite sides of a lake does not play a role in the stomatal response as reflected in SD and SI of plants during a single growing season.																			0883-1351	1938-5323				MAY-JUN	2010	25	5-6					339	346		10.2110/palo.2009.p09-107r	http://dx.doi.org/10.2110/palo.2009.p09-107r													WOS:000278751300006

Additional evidence is also provided by data from other basins of southern (San Rafael and Tepuel basins) and northern (Tarija basin) west Argentina. Five paleoclimatic stages have been defined. Paleoclimatic stage I (Tournaisian-Visean, Early Carboniferous) is characterized by temperate and humid preglacial conditions as evidenced in the El Raton and Maliman formations (Calingasta-Uspallata basin). Plant remains of Archeosigillaria and Lepidodendropsis zone are present in both units. The paleoclimatic stage II (Namurian-Early Westphalian, Middle Carboniferous) comprises widespread glacial deposits including glaciomarine sequences in the westernmost basins (Calingasta-Uspallata, western Paganzo, San Rafael and Tepuel) and terrestrial tillites and glaciolacustrine fine clastics in some areas of the Paganzo basin. Fossils of the Levipustula fauna are distinctive in the glaciomarine deposits of this stage and in the overlying postglacial fine clastics of the basal portion of stage III (substage IIIa). The paleoclimatic stage III, of Middle Carboniferous (Late Westphalian) age, corresponds to postglacial transgressions that flooded the previously glaciated shelves in the Calingasta-Uspallata and Tepuel basins, terminal glaciolacustrine deposits (substage IIIa), indicative of the demise of glacial conditions, and coal measures of fluvial affinity in the Paganzo basin (substage IIIb). Probably this postglacial stage was characterized by high humidity and moderate temperatures. This stage is paleobiologically defined by a floral assemblage known as NBG (Nothorhacopteris, Botrychiopsis and Ginkgophyllum). The paleoclimatic stage IV (Late Carboniferous (Stephanian)-Early Permian) corresponds to a time-interval characterized by seasonally dry climates and a progressive amelioration in humidity. Clear evidence of these climatic conditions is present in several localities in the Paganzo basin. The first Astherothecae and Glossopteris leaves are found. Finally, paleoclimatic stage V (Middle-Late? Permian) is dominated by red-beds, thick eolian sequences and saline lake facies deposited under arid to semi-arid conditions. Coeval volcanism derived from the west is expressed by interbedded tuffs and agglomerates (Calingasta-Uspallata, Paganzo and San Rafael basins).

J	Womble, RN; Driscoll, CT; Effler, SW				Womble, RN; Driscoll, CT; Effler, SW			Calcium carbonate deposition in Ca2+ polluted Onondaga Lake, New York, USA	WATER RESEARCH												Seasonal and long-term trends in the rate of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) deposition are documented for Ca2+ polluted Onondaga Lake, New York. These observations are based on particulate inorganic carbon and particulate calcium analyses of sediment trap collections, made weekly over the May-September interval for 10 years. Continuous deposition of CaCO3 was evident for the monitoring period of all 10 years. The average rate of CaCO3 deposition for the deployment interval decreased from about 0.196 to 0.082 mol . m(-2). d(-1) following the closure of the industrial source of Ca2+ pollution. This decline was generally consistent with the reductions in Ca2+ loading and lake Ca2+ concentrations over the same period. The prevailing rate of CaCO3 deposition in Onondaga Lake remains substantially higher than the rates documented for three other hardwater lakes in the literature. Calcium carbonate is the primary component and principal regulator of the dynamics of total solids deposition in the lake.

The results demonstrated the dominant role of light in the vertical distribution of autotrophic and mixotrophic microorganisms which are confined to the 0-5 m layer during thermal stratification. The bacterial biomass was high throughout the water column probably because of the great availability of dissolved organic matter. Consequently, the predatory microzooplankton and particularly the various trophic groups of ciliated protozoa, were distributed in the water column according to the vertical distribution of the particular food resources (detritus, bacteria, algae). However, despite the great abundance of algae and bacteria, biomass of flagellated and ciliated protozoa was relatively weak. Most of the phytoplanktonic biomass was filamentous (Diatoms) or colonial (Cyanobacteria) and therefore almost probably difficult to ingest for algivorous microzooplankton. Regarding the low abundance of bacterivorous protozoa, the relation with the special physicochemical properties of this lake is discussed.					; Carrias, Jean-François/AAT-2738-2021	Carrias, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-6201-1544; 													0018-8158					MAR 24	1995	300						71	84		10.1007/BF00024449	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00024449													WOS:A1995RB62500007

During the day, the surface zone was usually totally devoid of crustacean zooplankton. Even naupliar stages of Copepoda, were often absent in the surface zone in daytime, although they were numerous at night. There were clear differences in vertical distribution between species and localities, as well as between the seasons. Cyclopoida were generally found nearer the surface, as compared to the calanoid Tropodiaptomus simplex (especially in the southern arm of the lake). The maximum abundance of Cyclopoida was found both day and night at depths between 20 and 50 m. Occasionally Cyclopoids were found below 50 m and then, only in the southern end of the lake, in the Mpulungu area. Calanoids, in comparison, utilised a broader depth range. Maximum numbers were found below 100 m, but they were also very common down to 140 m. The maximum depth of their distribution was 220 m, but only in the southern part of the lake. The lower limit of vertical distribution and migration of crustaceans was evidently related to the low oxygen concentration in deep water. Thus the seasonal differences in the vertical distribution of Copepoda seem closely to follow the general mixing patterns of epilimnion. The different mixing patterns in the northern and southern arms of Lake Tanganyika also suggest differences in the biological components of the ecosystem. The northern arm of the lake is characterized by stratification and the predominance of Cyclopoida with short-range vertical migration, while the southern end is characterized by more mixing and the predominance of Calanoida, with extended vertical migration.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL	1999	407						115	121		10.1023/A:1003789415330	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003789415330													WOS:000083710100012

Each BRD (Authement-Ledet excluder, Cameron shooter, Lake Arthur excluder, and Eymard accelerator) was towed alongside a control net 72 times; tows were equally divided between areas and seasons. The Authement-Ledet excluder, Cameron shooter, and Lake Arthur excluder BRD's caught fewer fish (-36%, -51%, and -21%, respectively), but also fewer shrimp (-18%, -16%, and -24%) than corresponding control nets. Biomass catch differences were -42%, -33%, and -21% for fish and -14%, -14%, and -17% for shrimp. The Eymard accelerator caught 26% more fish numerically, 19% less fish biomass, and more shrimp (38% in numbers, 26% in biomass) than control nets. Differences between catches obtained with BRD nets and those with control nets depended upon the organisms present in an area. Abundances and size distributions of many species differed between areas; thus BRD's may have to be selected for the area where they are intended to be used.																			0090-0656					JUL	1997	95	3					552	565																WOS:A1997XH00300013

Microbial biomass at land water interface and its role in regulating ecosystem properties of a fresh water dry tropical woodland lake	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												This study was aimed at determining microbial biomass at land water interface and the role it plays in regulating ecosystem properties of a fresh water dry tropical woodland lake. Four microbial variables namely biomass-C (C-mic), fumigated CO2-C substrate induced respiration (SIR) and basal respiration (BR) were measured in humus samples collected from land water interface over a period of one year Microbial biomass (C-mic) was maximum during February (718 mu g CO2-C g(-1)). Similar was the case of fumigated CO2-C (560 mu g CO2-Cg(-1) 10 d(-1)), SIR (2900 mu g CO2-C g(-1)) and BR (480 mu g CO2-C g(-1)). Humus- N appeared maximum (1.60%) during November and phenolics (204 mu g g(-1)) during December Gross primary productivity (GPP) was found maximum (330 g C m(-2) d(-1)) during March. Almost similar trend appeared for chlorophyll and phytoplankton density. Variation in microbial biomass at land water interface can be explained by seasonality and the quality of substrate material. Asynchrony in the peaks of microbial variables with phytoplankton pulsation and GPP suggested that the microbial biomass through nutrient mineralization regulates ecosystem functioning of a fresh water woodland lake. This has relevance for evaluating the nature of anthropogenic perturbations and for maintenance of fresh water lakes void of human disturbances.

J	DUNN, PO; HANNON, SJ				DUNN, PO; HANNON, SJ			EFFECTS OF FOOD ABUNDANCE AND MALE PARENTAL CARE ON REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS AND MONOGAMY IN TREE SWALLOWS	AUK												We examined the roles of food abundance and male parental care in the maintenance of monogamy in Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor). Mated, male Tree Swallows were removed from territories to simulate the lack of male parental care that would be incurred by secondary females. Removals took place in lakeshore and roadside habitats in central Alberta, Canada. Insect sampling over three breeding seasons indicated that the lakeshore had greater biomass of insects than the roadside during egg laying, but there was no difference during the nestling period. Both our male removal experiment and natural cases of polygyny suggested that loss of male parental care had little effect on reproductive success or survival of females or their offspring. Unaided females increased their per-capita nest-visit rate in two of three years, so the rate of visitation per nestling did not differ significantly between unaided females and both the male and female at control nests. Control females at the lakeshore produced more fledglings than control females at the roadside. This difference in productivity was due to earlier laying and larger clutches at the lakeshore than at the roadside and not to differences in brood reduction or insect abundance during the nestling period. In both habitats, male parental care was relatively unimportant to female reproductive success and, therefore, within a given habitat secondary females did not incur a reproductive cost. All natural cases of polygyny occurred at the lakeshore. We suggest that polygyny occurred at the lakeshore, and not at the roadside, because food abundance was greater during laying at the lakeshore, and this allowed secondary females to lay more eggs and produce more fledglings than females mated to monogamous males at the roadside.

The pattern of monthly values of evaporation is not consistent from year to year. The normally expected pattern of low evaporation values in May, followed by increasing values in June to maximum values in July is true for only 3 of the 5 years. Comparison of annual evaporation calculated by the energy budget and mass transfer methods indicates that energy budget values varied from 13% greater to 11% less than mass transfer values. Furthermore, there is no seasonal bias in the pattern. Large differences exist in the magnitude of energy fluxes to and from Williams Lake. By far the greatest energy fluxes, having magnitudes of hundreds of watts per square meter, are incoming solar radiation, incoming atmospheric radiation, and outgoing long-wave radiation emitted by the lake water. The least energy fluxes are related to advection, which generally have magnitudes less than 5 W m-2.					; Rosenberry, Donald/C-2241-2013	Rosenberry, Donald/0000-0003-0681-5641; 													0043-1397					JUN	1992	28	6					1605	1617		10.1029/92WR00553	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/92WR00553													WOS:A1992HX30900010
J	Hootsmans, MJM				Hootsmans, MJM			Modelling Potamogeton pectinatus:: for better or for worse	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The SAGA plant growth model is introduced in connection with integrated weed management. SAGA describes the seasonal development of Potamogeton pectinatus L. The model is mainly driven by light climate characteristics (water layer extinction, periphyton shading) and their effects on plant photosynthesis and tuber production. It could be a tool for evaluating several weed control methods (mowing, shading, grazing) as it was calibrated and validated quite well for a vegetation growing in Lake Veluwe (The Netherlands). The SAGA model was used to provide management advice for a P. pectinatus vegetation growing profusively in two Argentine irrigation schemes. The model's re-calibration to local conditions was hampered by some unexplained variation in seasonal biomass cycle data. Nevertheless, the results obtained were considered quite acceptable for comparative scenario analysis. The simulated vegetation dynamics suggest that the mowing regime currently applied in the channels is not an optimal solution. Neither is an artifically increased turbidity, created by the introduction of benthivorous common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.). Their combination, however, may lead to quite satisfactory results, allowing a repetition of the mowing operation to be postponed by two years. Direct grazing of the vegetation by grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella Val.) also proved a potential management tool with substantial effect.																			0018-8158					NOV	1999	415						7	11		10.1023/A:1003889504338	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003889504338													WOS:000085019200002
J	Jamet, D; Amblard, C; Devaux, J				Jamet, D; Amblard, C; Devaux, J			Seasonal changes in alkaline phosphatase activity of bacteria and microalgae in Lake Pavin (Massif Central, France)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Seasonal changes in alkaline phosphatase activity of bacteria and microalgae were studied in the dimictic Lake Pavin (Massif Central, France), to test whether this activity is primarily algal or bacterial and whether the APA presents seasonal variations coupled with abiotic and biotic variables. Samples were collected at different depths from May 1992 to May 1993. The specific phosphatase activities were analysed spectrophotometrically with p-Nitrophenyl Phosphate (p-NPP) as substrate and were related to the protein concentrations. No correlation was found between alkaline phosphatase activity and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations across an annual cycle. The specific activities of the small class (0.2-1.2 mu m) were the highest and the contribution of this picoplanktonic size class (0.2-1.2 mu m) increased with depth. In addition, the linear correlations between alkaline phosphatase activity and protein concentration seemed to indicate that most of these enzymes are constitutive. However, it cannot be excluded that the high phosphorus concentrations repress APA. Finally, the measure of APA does not seem to be a valid quantitative test of the deficiency of phosphorus for aquatic microorganisms.

J	Ruggerone, GT; Rogers, DE				Ruggerone, GT; Rogers, DE			Multi-year effects of high densities of sockeye salmon spawners on juvenile salmon growth and survival: a case study from the Exxon Valdez oil spill	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Reduced fishing after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound, Alaska, contributed to exceptionally large numbers of sockeye salmon spawners up to 860 km from the spill site. We measured annual scale growth of adult sockeye salmon from four affected populations, 1970-1997, in order to test the hypothesis that large spawner densities can have multi-year effects on juvenile size and subsequent adult abundances as a result of intraspecific competition among juveniles in the nursery lake. Sockeye salmon scale growth in fresh water was significantly reduced by the large 1989 spawner densities in the Kenai River system, Red Lake, Akalura Lake, but not Chignik Lake. Scale growth in the three affected systems recovered to previous levels 2-4 years after the oil spill, but subsequent moderately high spawner densities led to exceptionally low growth. Juvenile salmon growth was negatively related to parent spawners, spawners from the next brood year (second season in lake), and spawners from the previous brood year. Multi-variate time series analyses indicated adult sockeye salmon abundance increased with greater numbers of parent spawners, but decreased as a result of either large numbers of spawners in the previous year or small juvenile salmon size. These results indicate sockeye salmon spawners can affect juvenile growth and adult production of adjacent year classes. Implications for stock-recruitment modeling and spawner density management are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Therefore, zooplankton is exposed to a highly heterogeneous environment in the vertical dimension. In this work, We analyze the depth-distribution of the cladoceran Daphnia ambigua in the eutrophic, monomictic lake El Plateado at midday and midnight, along with its relationship with the vertical distribution of water temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration. We also attempt to define whether or not this population exhibits a diel vertical migration. The results show significant changes in the day/night vertical distribution of D. ambigua during its growing season, with the exception of the last date. Also, the data revealed that average depth selected by D. ambigua becomes shallower with time, and the amplitude of the vertical migration decreases throughout the season. During the period of lake stratification, temperature appears positively correlated, and oxygen negatively correlated to the frequency of D. ambigua. It is suggested that oxygen concentration plays a crucial role in modulating the vertical migration behavior of D. ambigua in lake El Plateado, which has important consequences for understanding the atypical pattern of population dynamics exhibited by this species.

J	Adler, GH; Lambert, TD				Adler, GH; Lambert, TD			Ecological correlates of trap response of a Neotropical forest rodent, Proechimys semispinosus	JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY												Patterns of trap response in the Central American spiny rat (Proechimys semispinosus), a frugivorous forest rodent, were examined in relation to age, sex, density and resource abundance. Populations on four small islands (designated numbers 4, 8, 14, and 52) in Gatun Lake (central Panama) were sampled by live-trapping for four nights every month for four years. Trappability was calculated as the proportion of all individuals known to be alive that were actually captured. Mean body mass at first capture was within the range of subadult body masses and differed among islands but not between sexes. Trappabilities summed over the entire study were generally low and differed among islands and age classes (juveniles, subadults and adults) and between sexes. In general, adults were more trappable than juveniles and subadults, and females (particularly adults) were more trappable than males. Trappability and the number of captures per individual varied seasonally and were generally greatest during December and January. Monthly estimates of these two variables were examined for autocorrelation, and the order of the autoregressive error model was determined separately for each island population. The arcsine of trappability and the number of captures per individual were regressed on log,, densities of spiny rats and of fruiting trees and lianas after controlling for autocorrelation. Both trappability indices were negatively related to the density of fruiting trees and lianas on islands 8 and 14, indicating that spiny rats may be seasonally food-stressed. The number of captures per individual was related positively to the density of spiny rats on island 52 and negatively on island 8. Results indicate that spiny rat populations must be sampled with greater intensity and duration than temperate forest rodents.																			0266-4674					JAN	1997	13		1				59	68		10.1017/S0266467400010257	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0266467400010257													WOS:A1997WH63200005

Distribution, productivity and reproduction along water regime gradients were assessed, and the importance of wetland nutrient status in altering plant response to water regime was also considered. The overall range in distribution observed across the lakes was similar for both species, but there was significant between-lake variation in distribution relative to mean water depth. Neither species occupied its full 'potential' distribution range, relative to water regime, at any one wetland. Standing biomass and ramet and inflorescence densities varied along the water regime gradient, with peak values generally occurring at intermediate water depths. There was a shift in phenology (ramet emergence, new leaf growth, flowering and seed production) with increasing mean water depth and nutrient status. Seasonal values of above-ground productivity changed along the water regime gradient for both species. Comparison of productivity at sampling points of different nutrient status but similar water regime showed a significantly greater growth response in T. orientalis compared with B. articulata. The significance of these results to urban wetland management is discussed.

J	HENDERSON, PA; HAMILTON, HF				HENDERSON, PA; HAMILTON, HF			STANDING CROP AND DISTRIBUTION OF FISH IN DRIFTING AND ATTACHED FLOATING MEADOW WITHIN AN UPPER AMAZONIAN VARZEA LAKE	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The standing crop and distribution of fish within the floating meadow habitat of Lago Mamiraua, an upper Amazonian floodplain lake, were studied during December 1993 when the water was rising and had just begun to enter the forest. The ichthyofauna was dominated by six groups, the Anostomidae, Gymnotiformes, Erythrinidae, Serrasalmidae, Synbranchidae and Cichlidae. For anchored meadow, total wet weight was estimated as 312 kg ha(-1) and total number as 90 400 individuals ha(-1). This biomass estimate was probably below the annual maximum because some fish had already dispersed into the forest, but, the number of individuals was close to the annual maximum because of the recent arrival of juvenile Serrasalmidae and Cichlidae. For drifting islands of meadow fish biomass and density were estimated as 192 kg ha(-1) and 12 700 individuals ha(-1) respectively. The Synbranchidae, Gymnotiformes and Erythrinidae avoided drifting meadow. In comparison, the Cichlidae and Anostomidae, while favouring marginal, anchored meadow, were frequently dispersed by drifting islands. The Siluriformes were unique in favouring drifting over anchored meadow. For this group the observed down-stream drift may be a seasonal migration to the main river channels. Juvenile fish avoided drifting islands, presumably to avoid being hushed from the lakes. Their abundance was lowest at the mouth of the lake. The generally abundant Serrasalmus spp. juveniles were absent from meadow at the mouth of the lake.

The earliest stone-tool-using, meat-eating hominids are argued to have most regularly encountered abandoned felid kills of medium-sized adult herbivores in riparian woodlands during the dry season, kills from which little flesh but all marrow and head contents could have been obtained. Additionally, it is suggested that they may have encountered large quantities of scavengeable flesh if sabertooth predation was concentrated on large herbivores. Such reconstruction of a possible hominid scavenging niche is considered a prerequisite to the development of criteria for the archaeological recognition of scavenging.																			0011-3204	1537-5382				AUG-OCT	1987	28	4					383	407		10.1086/203544	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/203544													WOS:A1987K876000001

Turning back the effects of anthropopression demands taking immediate action not only within the lake basin in the form of technological remediation measures. Primarily, these should be protective action, involving the organization of water supply and sewage disposal in the basin and (which is much more difficult) reduction of biogenic substance flow to the lake. Remediation ventures have been applied throughout the world, not always with success. They are thought to be risky, long-term and demanding considerable financial outlays. For this reason, they must be carefully planned by a team of experts and conducted under permanent supervision. The article presents effects of restoration of lake Jelonek based on the analysis of water quality parameters. The lake has been completely degraded and reached the saprotrophic state due to discharge of domestic wastewater from the neighbouring living estate, and of agricultural. The lakes restoration was initiated by dosing of coagulants for sediment. The aim of the study carried out was the analysis of selected physical and chemical indicators in the waters of the lake Jelonek in Gniezno. In water samples taken from three points following parameters were determined: temperature, pH, nitrogen, nitrates, nitrites, ammonium nitrogen, phosphorus and phosphates. Measurements were conducted since October 2010 till may 2011, regularly once a month. The water was taken in the current on depth of 20 cm. The temperature and pH of the water were characteristic for the studied seasons and had no significant impact on the content of nutrients. The result of carrying out restoration lakes and tributary pollution mitigation procedures was to reduce the amount of nitrite and total phosphorus.

It is located on the Gradina peninsula near Rogoznica. The lake represents extreme karst with typical characteristics of meromictic and euxinic environments. The main characteristic of Lake Rogoznica is the existence of a marked seasonal stratification of water layers and the occurrence of euxinic conditions in the water gauge at the depths larger than 9 m. The mixing of water layers depends on meteorological conditions and can be gradual or sudden. At sudden mixing, the oxidation of millimolar sulfide concentration may lead to sudden oxygen consumption, sedimentation of colloidal sulphur in the surface layer and occurrence of anoxia in the whole water gauge of the lake. From 1994 to the present day, science investigations of Lake Rogoznica have been systematically carried out, showing that the lake is not only a unique anoxic environment on the Adriatic coast, but also in the entire Mediterranean. The lake is a natural bioreactor, with processes whose balance and dynamics are very sensitive to external environmental influences, including the global climate change as well.					ciglenecki, irena/N-8792-2013	Ciglenecki, Irena/0000-0002-1873-6193													1330-1144						2013	21	86					295	302																WOS:000421294400004

The conventional in-situ measurements of water levels based on gauge station are often rarely available or difficult to be shared to the public especially for lakes in the developing countries and trans-boundary basins. Satellite altimetry provides an alternative solution to obtaining water level variations in lakes. In this study, the laser altimetry product GLAS/ICESat L2 Global Land Surface Altimetry (ICESat-GLA14) data was used to derive water levels in a narrow long-shaped reservoir in the Nile Basin, i.e. Roseires Reservoir in Sudan. A total of 19 water levels were derived from ICESat-GLA14 during the period 2003-2009. Compared with the in-situ measurements, all 19 ICESat-derived water levels had a R-2 of 0.88 and RMSE of 138.80 cm. After excluding two water levels (occurred on June 21, 2004 and June 8, 2005) with very large standard deviation (> 1 m), other 17 ICESat-derived water levels were in excellent agreement with in-situ measurements with R-2 of 0.99 and RMSE of 16.96 cm. In practical situation, the high standard deviation can be considered as an indicator for unreliable water level which is better excluded for further application. Two problematic water levels showed high overestimation of the in-situ measurements, and they occurred at the lowest water level situations and during rainy season. The exact reason for such high overestimation needs to be investigated in the future study.					duan, zheng/D-6409-2011														2153-6996		978-1-4799-1114-1				2013							2884	2887		10.1109/IGARSS.2013.6723427	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2013.6723427													WOS:000345638902243

Fish were sampled between March 2000 and February 2001 and March 2003 and February 2004 in the Sinha Mariana and Chacorore lagoons, wetlands of the Pantanal Matogrossense. Fish was the predominant food in the diet, but shrimps and insects have been also consumed. The diet of P. ternetzi was significantly different between lagoons, but no difference was detected between dry and flood periods. In Sinha Mariana lagoon, the diet mainly consisted of Psectrogaster curviventris, in both periods. In the flood period in Chacorore lagoon, fish was the dominant food (especially Astyanax spp., Leporinus spp. and Schizodon borellii), and in dry, shrimp and Eigenmannia spp. The Spearman coefficient indicated no correlation between the abundance of caught fish species and their abundances in the diet of P. ternetzi in Sinha Mariana lagoon, and a strong negative correlation at Chacorore lagoon, although some very consumed preys were numerically abundant in the environment. Despite the intake of insect and shrimp, P. ternetzi was piscivorous since immature stages. A correlation between each item and the size classes of P. ternetzi was tested by means of Pearson correlation that showed that the changes in the use of resources over ontogenetic development have been represented by increased intake of P. curviventris in Mariana lagoon, and S. borellii at Chacorore lagoon, accompanying the increase in the size of the predator. In this way, the results suggest that several factors can be involved in the use of food resources by P. ternezi, among them the abundance, the size and morphological characteristics of the prey.

Holistic Integration of Organic Strategies and High Tunnels for Midwest/Great Lakes Fruit Production	II INTERNATIONAL ORGANIC FRUIT SYMPOSIUM	Acta Horticulturae				2nd International Organic Fruit Symposium	JUN 18-21, 2012	Leavenworth, WA	Int Soc Hort Sci				Growers who want to produce organic fruits in non-arid cool climate areas like the Midwest/Great Lakes need expanded strategies for soil, plant, pest (insect, disease, weed), and environmental management to enhance crop diversity, productivity, market opportunities, and profitability. Research begun in 2005 on multi-bay high tunnel production of brambles (Rubus spp.) and sweet cherries (Prunus avium) revealed some distinct advantages that might better facilitate organic production. The Michigan State University (MSU) High Tunnel Organic Fruit project was initiated with funding from the Ceres Organic Trust in 2009 and established fully with funding from the USDA-NIFA Organic Research and Extension Initiative in 2010 (Award 2010-51300-21395). The project goal is to develop and disseminate knowledge for integrating organic production systems with environment-modifying techniques, such as high tunnels, to discover holistic and synergistic strategies for crop protection, soil building, season extension, and expansion of organic production potential for brambles, sweet cherries, and apple (Malus xdomestica) nursery trees. Practices to be studied include composts, cover crops, biodiversification, ecological weed management, and crop canopy management. Soil building and health maintenance in perennial fruit systems under high tunnels is a particularly unique and little-studied need that is critical for sustainable organic fruit production in the Midwest region. Stakeholder partners include a comparative (non-high tunnel) organic grower for each fruit crop, with the high tunnel apple nursery tree production being conducted both at MSU and with the organic apple stakeholder. Project outreach will include: a) educational programs and demonstration plot walks in association with the MSU Student Organic Farm, b) on-farm trials and workshops with stakeholders, c) on-line delivery of organic farming principles and practices, and d) development of extension publications and professional journal articles. Project outcomes will help organic farmers extend their seasons, improve their ecosystem services, and diversify their production and market potentials.

However, a large part of aquatic water bodies consists of small pools, ponds, and streams, which tend to be environmentally heterogeneous over relatively small spatial scales. We studied a bacterial metacommunity of 16 rock pools at a spatial scale of 600 m(2), which was sampled at approximately monthly intervals over the course of 1 yr. We show that temporal dynamics were not evidently synchronous between rock pools over time and that there was no clear seasonal pattern. The environmental variable that explained the most of the temporal dynamics in rock pools over time was water colour, which is often not the main variable explaining spatial differences in bacterial composition between pools. Our results suggest that temporal dynamics of bacterial communities both among and within small water bodies show markedly different patterns compared to larger previously investigated systems, presumably due to their larger heterogeneity and less synchronous environmental changes.

J	Scheinin, M; Sjöqvist, C; Mattila, J				Scheinin, Matias; Sjoqvist, Conny; Mattila, Johanna			Microalgal plankton composition in shallow coastal inlets in contrasting trophic and alternative community states	HYDROBIOLOGIA												As the trophic state of the environment changes, communities develop into divergent states. These community states are conventionally reflected through primary producers, because they are directly affected by nutrient availability. Studies of submerged macrophytes often focus on community composition to decipher the vegetative (community) state of the environment, while planktic microalgae are usually viewed more cursorily. Although microalgal plankton composition has been related to the trophic state of shallow temperate lakes, corresponding qualitative knowledge is lacking for shallow inlets in the sea. We assessed the composition of microalgal plankton in relation to that of submerged macrophytes in shallow inlets in the northern Baltic Sea during one ice-free season. Microalgal plankton composition varied distinctively among inlets in different trophic and vegetative states especially during early and mid-season, before becoming comparably uniform. These patterns were consisted both inside and outside of macrophyte beds and during day and night. Local and diurnal variation was comparably high in eutrophic and charophyte-dominated inlets, but only during early season. Microalgal plankton composition not only reflects the state of littoral communities in varying trophic conditions, but it may also be important for the whole trophic structure of those communities.

Gas-phase deposition of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) to a water surface sampler	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												In this study a water surface sampler (WSS) was utilized to directly measure gas phase deposition of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The measured gas phase PCB fluxes averaged about 880 +/- 660 ngm(-2)d(-1), which was higher than the fluxes calculated using simultaneously measured air and water concentrations for natural surface waters. These large fluxes were due to fact that the measured fluxes were only in the absorption direction since deposited PCBs were continuously removed from the system using an XAD column resulting in the maximum possible flux rate from the air to the WSS water. Ambient air PCBs were also sampled simultaneously with a modified high volume sampler. The gas phase PCB concentrations changed between 0.90 and 4.46 ngm(-3) (2.18 +/- 1.16 ngm(-3)). The mass transfer coefficients (MTCs), calculated by dividing the fluxes by the gas phase concentrations was 0.40 +/- 0.36 cms(-1). The average MTC was comparable with those calculated using a similar configuration of a WSS.					; Tasdemir, Yucel/AAG-9468-2021	Holsen, Thomas/0000-0001-9599-6733; 													1093-4529					OCT	2006	41	10					2071	2087		10.1080/10934520600867797	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934520600867797								17018402					WOS:000240965800001
J	de Hoyos, C; Comín, FA				de Hoyos, C; Comín, FA			The importance of inter-annual variability for management	HYDROBIOLOGIA					Conference on Hydrobiologia	MAR, 1996	UNIV LEICESTER, LEICESTER, ENGLAND		UNIV LEICESTER			In regions with high inter-annual climatic variability, lake management strategies should be based on scientific data covering the maximum range of lake dynamics. Lake Sanabria is a monomictic lake located in a gneiss-dominated glacial valley at 1000 m a. m. s. l. in NW Spain. A three-year study was carried out during 1987-89 to obtain the basic ecological knowledge required for a sustainable lake management. Water and phytoplankton samples were collected from several depths of the water column at the deepest zone of the lake. Temperature and Secchi disk visibility, and total and dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus, chlorophyll a, and phytoplankton species composition and abundance (in laboratory) were determined monthly following standard limnological methods. Stratification began in March-April, with the thermocline stabilized at between 6-10 m, and lasted until November-December. The euphotic depth was higher than the mixing depth throughout the stratification period, except in the month previous to the water column mixing. The water residence time, estimated from the volume of the lake and the inflows and outflows, was between 0.48-0.67 years. However, during the months of highest rainfall (September-February) it was up to three times greater than during the same months of low rainy years. Nutrient concentrations in the water were very low throughout the year (52 mu g l(-1) dissolved inorganic nitrogen, 6.1 mu g l(-1) soluble reactive phosphorus, and 1.45 mg l(-1) soluble reactive silica) and dominated by the dissolved organic fractions, which was related to the inputs of organic materials from the densely forested catchment. The colour of the lake, 21-41 mg Pt l(-1), is also indicative of the relatively high amount of organic substances dissolved in the waters of the lake. A bloom of cyanobacteria ( Microcystis flos-aquae, Aphanothece clathrata, Merismopedia tenuisssima, Synechococcus sp.) persisted in most of the water column during August 1988-March 1989, associated with the high residence time of the water. In contrast, the cyanobacteria bloom was limited to the mesolimnion for 3-5 months during 1987 and 1989. A model is proposed for the seasonal variation of the phytoplankton, which differentiates the seasonal trend during years of high water turnover from that of years with long residence time. Lake Sanabria is oligotrophic, based on a range of criteria (Secchi disk visibility, chlorophyll a concentration, total phosphorus concentration). However, during years of long water residence time (e.g. 1988), the annual input of total phosphorus is critical to maintain the characteristics of the lake. Short-term strategies for the management of lakes should take into account the inter-annual variability rather than averages as indicators to prevent the impact of increased nutrient inputs derived from changes in land and water use in the catchment area. Long-term strategies should also consider the potential changes in the lake's dynamics, derived from the changes in the rainfall pattern caused by climatic changes.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	1999	395						281	291		10.1023/A:1017030526231	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017030526231													WOS:000082727900026

The mean size of the dominant prey was found to increase as smelt mouth gape increased. Smelt smaller than 40 mm total length fed mostly on zooplankton. Chironomid larvae, pupae, and adults were the dominant foods of larger fish from most sites, although mysids and amphipods were the major prey in Lake Waahi and the Waikato River estuary. Algae were the dominant food in many smelt but ingestion was probably incidental. Seasonal and annual differences in dominant foods were minor. Common smelt an generalists, capable of feeding on the majority of smaller organisms present in their different environments; however, they may grow faster and achieve a larger adult size when food of optimal size and nutritive value is present.																			0028-8330	1175-8805				JUN	1997	31	2					147	154		10.1080/00288330.1997.9516753	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1997.9516753													WOS:A1997XK98800001

Daily variation in nitrogen fixation was measured during three periods of the crop cycle: tillering (formation of secondary stems in the rice plants), heading (formation of reproductive structures), and maturity. Two locations were examined over two consecutive years (1994 and 1995). Despite differences in the crop-cycle periods, location, and year, a consistent pattern of nitrogen fixation was observed, with a main activity peak in the morning and another in the late evening. Short-term experiments, performed on two cyanobacterial blooms (Nostoc sp. and Anabaena sp.) exposed to natural light under plant canopy (7% incidence irradiance), and to different light intensities under neutral density screens without plant cover (full sunlight, 43%, 26%, and 13% of incident irradiance), indicated that nitrogenase activity (NA) was dependent on both light intensity and quality. In long-term experiments, where natural communities of cyanobacteria were exposed to one month of different light intensities, changes in the species composition of the three main genera of heterocystous cyanobacteria (Nostoc, Anabaena, and Calothrix) were observed. The light intensity at which communities were exposed for one month became the optimum irradiance for NA for each cyanobacterial community. Assays performed at higher or lower irradiances showed lower NA. Nitrogen fixation followed a pattern of seasonal variation along the crop cycle. Values were low at the beginning of the crop (May), reached a maximum value at the end of the tillering stage (June), and declined thereafter until the end of the cultivation cycle (September).

J	FLORES, RE; EDDELMAN, WR				FLORES, RE; EDDELMAN, WR			CALIFORNIA BLACK RAIL USE OF HABITAT IN SOUTHWESTERN ARIZONA	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Use of habitat by the California black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis coturniculus), a subspecies threatened in California and endangered in Arizona, is not sufficiently well known for effective management. From March 1987 to December 1988, we studied use of habitat by 36 radio-transmittered California black rails at Mittry Lake Wildlife Management Area, Arizona. Birds selected (P < 0.05) areas dominated by giant bulrush (Scirpus californicus) throughout all seasons and used southern cattail (Typha domingensis) less frequently than expected (P < 0.05). California black rails selected (P < 0.001) areas close to upland vegetation during the postbreeding season, possibly because broods could not use areas with water >6 cm deep. Birds used areas that were closer to vegetation-type edges, were drier, and had shorter vegetation compared with available habitat (P < 0.001). Habitat structure was more effective than plant composition in predicting California black rail use of habitat. Because California black rails may not use areas within wetlands where deep water occurs, we recommend that fluctuations in water level be minimized in wetlands managed for California black rails, especially during the nesting season. Assessment of California black rail habitat should include not only vegetational cover, but also water depths within wetlands, access to upland vegetation, and overhead coverage by emergent vegetation.																			0022-541X					APR	1995	59	2					357	363		10.2307/3808949	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3808949													WOS:A1995QT32800019
J	Inaotombi, S; Gupta, PK				Inaotombi, Shaikhom; Gupta, Prem Kumar			Fate of Metals in Relation to Water and Sediment Properties in a Subtropical Lake in Central Himalaya, India	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Lakes of Himalaya are one of the most fragile ecosystems on earth. Tourism and urban development in the upland region strongly affect its water resources. The high rate of sedimentation and organic matter deposition alters the ecological state of sediment bed, which indirectly influences on dynamics of metallic elements. We investigated spatial and temporal variations of water and sediment characteristic in Lake Sattal of Central Himalaya, India. Samples were collected seasonally from four sampling locations from January 2011 to December 2012. Pearson's correlation and Canonical correspondence analysis (CCAs) were applied to examine the dynamics and behaviors of heavy metals. Concentrations of elements were in the order of fluoride (Fl) > zinc (Zn) > copper (Cu) > iron (Fe) > manganese (Mn). Sand size fraction was higher in the littoral zone while clay particle was dominant in the profundal zone of the lake. Dissolved oxygen at sediment-water-interface (SWI) and water temperature were the major factors influencing the dynamics of metallic contents in the water column. Spatially, total organic matter (TOM) was higher in the deeper portion of the lake. Our study revealed that mobility of Fe is temperature-dependent, whereas speciation of Mn and Cu are primarily controlled by the suboxic condition of SWI in organic-rich site. Upland lakes are more vulnerable to anoxic condition and have severe implications on heavy metals speciation. Proper implementation of land use policies and management practices, including stormwater detention, can be integrated into resolving such problems.

Understanding movement patterns of multiple species sharing the same niche may clarify coexistence mechanisms. Therefore, the movement patterns of three bitterling species, Acheilognathus tabira erythropterus, Acheilognathus melanogaster, and Rhodeus ocellatus ocellatus, were examined between June and November 2009 in an agricultural ditch system associated with Lake Kasumigaura in central Japan. The mark-recapture method was used with a fixed releasing point in an approximately 5.5 km-long ditch. Movement distances of A. t. erythropterus and A. melanogaster were longer than that of R. o. ocellatus, but the direction of movement was similar among the three species. However, R. o. ocellatus moved to locations with a low dissolved oxygen concentration and deeper water. These results suggest that R. o. ocellatus may adapt better to environmental fluctuations, because its tolerance to hypoxia is the highest of the three species. Compared with R. o. ocellatus, A. t. erythropterus and A. melanogaster may move relatively longer distances to search for suitable habitats following an environmental fluctuation.

Evaluation	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system has been adapted to simulate the regional fate and transport of atrazine. Model modifications and simulations spanning April to mid-July 1995 are described in a previous paper. CMAQ results for atrazine concentrations in air and rainfall are evaluated against field observations taken along the Mississippi River and the shores of Lake Michigan in 1995. CMAQ results agree within 10% of published annual wet deposition load estimates for Lake Michigan and predicted annual dry deposition lies within published error bounds. Comparisons of weekly observed and predicted air and rainfall concentrations along the Mississippi River yield order-of-magnitude differences. Precipitation weighting of concentrations in rainfall good agreement for seasonal time frames. Weekly ambient gas form concentrations tend to be overpredicted by the CMAQ and semivolatile particulate fractions are underpredicted. Uncertainty in CMAQ predictions of air and rainfall concentrations for atrazine appear to derive primarily from uncertainty in emissions estimates, simulated precipitation, and spatial scale.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				NOV 1	2002	36	21					4593	4599		10.1021/es011372q	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es011372q								12433169					WOS:000179002700033

In order to clarify the mechanism of the lake expansion, the physical conditions, water budget and heal budget of the lake were examined by measuring water temperature, water turbidity, lake level, meteorology and water discharge. These measurements were carried out in the monsoon season of July 1997, when the glacier melt occurred in the ablation area with air temperature of more than 0 degrees C. Density stratification in the lake is built up by an effect of water pressure on lake water, but, neglecting the effect, lake water density is defined by suspended sediment concentration rather than temperature. Glacier-melt water from the subaqueous part of the glacier terminus mixed with lake surface water of 4-8 degrees C, and diffused the water of about 3 degrees C into the deeper zone of the lake. This advective, thermal diffusion occurs by sediment-laden underflow and relatively clear density interflow. The sediment-laden underflow is induced by intermittent glacier-melt sediment discharge at the terminus, while the density interflow is probably produced by continuous glacier-melt water discharge. Calculation of water budget of the lake indicates that meltwater inflow at the glacier terminus and surface water outflow at the outlet determine the hydrological conditions of the lake. The net heat transfer by melting of the terminal ice and dead ice, connected to the lake expansion, was evaluated by calculating the heat budget of the lake.

The dense moss carpet in lake L-1 (mainly, Sphagnum denticulatum Bird.) occurred at a depth of 5.0-7.5 m and covered about 50% of the bottom area. The monospecific moss carpets occurred in lake L2 (Warnstorfia exannulata s. lato) and lake L3 (Fontinalis hypnoides Hartm.) at depths of 5.0-7.0 m and 4.5-5.5 m and covered 20 and 13% of the bottom, respectively. The moss phytomass was 43-53 g air-dry mass m(-)2 in the lake L2 and lake L3, while it was much higher in lake L1 - 293 g m(-2). Seasonal changes in shoot morphology of S. denticulatum, W. exannulata s. lato and in size and density of leaves along the shoot axis of F. hypnoides allowed to reconstruct the annual growth and to estimate of growth rates of the mosses in their natural habitat within dense carpet. The absolutely net production of the mosses was estimated on the basis of these data. In two lakes (L2 and L3), the annual means of absolutely net production of the aquatic mosses were 32-41 g air-dry mass m(-)2 yr (-1), while in the third lake (L1) they were markedly higher - 157 g m(-2).

The influence of underyearling (0+) fish on planktonic algal biomass and composition was examined during June-August in eight large enclosures (40 m(3)). Averaged for the entire period, Daphnia densities, transparency and phosphate concentrations were significantly higher (P <0.05) and chlorophyll a values significantly lower in fishless controls than in enclosures with fish (bleak (Alburnus alburnus), roach (Rutilus rutilus) or perch (Perca fluviatilis)). 2. Enclosures without fish demonstrated a more heterogeneous algal community structure than enclosures with fish. Desmidiales and dinoflagellates were more abundant in controls, whereas green algae dominated the phytoplankton community in enclosures with fish. Larger grazing-resistant algae occurred most frequently in enclosures without fish. 3. The importance of cascading trophic interactions was demonstrated even under strong eutrophic conditions. The strongest effects on Daphnia densities, phytoplankton biomass and nutrients were observed in enclosures with perch, with weaker effects in enclosures with cyprinids. Differences in initial fish size and species accounted for the top-down effects observed. The results of this study emphasize the importance of 0+ perch as a key predator in structuring the plankton community in lakes.

Here, we present a framework that integrates Landsat and MODIS data using a gap-filled Savitzky-Golay fusion algorithm to reconstruct an 8-day, 30 m-resolution time series of water inundation and vegetation dynamics in Dongting Lake (2000-2022). Beyond achieving high accuracy (water classification: 96.4 %; NDVI R-2 = 0.91), our approach quantifies monthly inundation trends and uncovers spatially differentiated hydrological shifts. We document a pronounced drying trend characterized by an annual reduction of 11.4 km(2) in inundation area and an advanced timing of lakebed exposure across 84.7 % of the wetland-changes most evident in East Dongting Lake during dry seasons and along flood channels during wet seasons. Correspondingly, enhanced vegetation growth is evident from an average NDVI increase of 0.0023/ year, with rapid dry-season greening (NDVI increases > 0.004/year in September-October) closely linked to prolonged lakebed exposure. These shifts, driven mainly by anthropogenic impacts following the Three Gorges Dam operation, risk disrupting native phenology and accelerating landscape transitions. Our robust methodology for analyzing intra- and inter-annual hydrological-ecological interaction provides actionable insights for managing Dongting Lake and lays a foundation for applying similar approaches to floodplain wetlands under escalating climatic and human pressures.

This study develops an Integrated Postprocessing Approach (IPA) to iteratively estimate time variable signals and filter noise using a harmonic model plus a non-seasonal signal term. The stochastic characteristics of non-seasonal signals are described using an exponential function. To improve computational efficiency, the non-seasonal signals are represented by a Gauss-Markov process and estimated by Kalman filtering. The Terrestrial Water Storage Anomaly (TWSA) signals across 22 global basins from April 2002 to December 2023 estimated by IPA exhibit high spatial resolution, closely matching Combined Mascon (CM) solutions. Relative to CM solutions, IPA reduces the latitude-weighted RMSEs of spatial TWSA signals by 8.0% while increases the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of TWSA series by 2.1% compared to Improved Parameter Filtering (IPF; Zhang et al. 2024) approach. Additionally, IPA estimates significantly enhanced trends and strong annual amplitudes of TWSA signals in the Amazon and Parana basins, along with the volume variances of Three-Gorges Reservoir and Poyang Lake, as well as 2.1 and 4.2-year interannual volume variance signals in Victoria Lake. The Water Storage Drought Index (WSDI) constructed by IPA aligns well with SPEI-6 in detecting the duration and intensity of severe droughts and floods in typical basins.

J	Clapperton, BK				Clapperton, BK			Abundance of wasps and prey consumption of paper wasps (Hymenoptera, Vespidae: Polistinae) in Northland, New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Polistine and vespine wasps were captured in Malaise traps in two fire-modified shrubland habitats of varying canopy height and composition at Lake Ohia, Northland, New Zealand. Prey consumption rates were calculated for the Asian paper wasp (Polistes chinensis antennalis) occupying these two areas of shrubland and a home garden in Whangarei, Northland. The sites were systematically searched for nests and wasp prey determined by intercepting foragers returning to nests. The Asian paper wasp predominated in the Malaise trap samples from the low-growing habitat while the German wasp (Vespula germanica) was more common in the taller vegetation type. The Asian paper wasp was more abundant than the German wasp in the samples in February and early March. Only four Australian paper wasps (Polistes humilis) and no common wasps (Vespula vulgaris) were caught. Asian paper wasps collected an estimated 15 000 prey loads per ha per season from one of the shrubland areas, and 478 000 prey loads per ha per season from the second area. These convert to estimates of 31 and 957 g per ha per season of invertebrate biomass removed by paper wasps from each habitat, respectively. The estimate for the garden site was 79 g per ha per season. Wasp nest densities varied between 20 and 210 nests per hectare. The biomass estimates are similar to average figures calculated for vespine wasps in scrubland and pasture. Both Asian paper wasps and Australian paper wasps preyed mainly on lepidopteran larvae. The cabbage white butterfly (Pieris rapae) was the most commonly collected species. Noctuid species were also well represented. Both male and female Asian paper wasps collected nectar in late March and early April.																			0110-6465						1999	23	1					11	19																WOS:000081128000002

Foraging termites were collected using traps before the trees were dismantled to count the remaining non-foragers, Approximately 20 - 50% of the populations were collected from the traps and were considered foragers, Soldier proportions ranged from 12 to 28% of the total colony population, but a higher proportion (14 - 46%) was found in the traps, i.e. the foraging sites. Total worker counts (27,000 - 130,000) and mean worker weight (2.2 - 3.3 mg per worker) for these restricted colonies were smaller than those from land-based colonies of C. formosanus estimated at 1,000,000 - 7,000,000 termites per colony with worker weights of 2.8 - 5.0 mg.					su, nan/GRS-5213-2022														0361-6525						1999	33	2					185	193																WOS:000079600000009
J	ZOTZ, G; WINTER, K				ZOTZ, G; WINTER, K			A ONE-YEAR STUDY ON CARBON, WATER AND NUTRIENT RELATIONSHIPS IN A TROPICAL C-3-CAM HEMI-EPIPHYTE, CLUSIA-UVITANA PITTIER	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												Diel (24 h) courses of CO2 and water-vapour exchange of leaves of hemi-epiphytic plants of Clusia uvitana Pittier (Clusiaceae) were measured under natural tropical conditions in the semi-evergreen moist forest of Barro Colorado Island, Panama, from January 1991 until January 1992. Plants were studied at two sites, in the crown of a 47-m tall tree (Ceiba pentandra) and on the shore of Lake Gatun, at a height of about 2-4 m. The following results were obtained: (1) Diel carbon gain was mainly a function of photosynthetic photon fluence rate (PFFR) on individual days. PPFR also strongly affected CAM activity. A leafless period of the host tree Ceiba pentandra resulted in higher incident PPFRs and slightly lower nighttime temperatures in the canopy of C. uvitana; this led to increases in both daytime and nighttime CO2 fixation. (2) In fully mature sun leaves from the two sites, nocturnal net uptake of atmospheric CO2 occurred on almost all of the 71 days measured and nocturnal carbon gain was enhanced during the dry season. (3) In C. uvitana at the Lake site, 24-h carbon gain during the wet and dry season was similar to C. uvitana at the Ceiba site during the leafless period of the host tree. Overall CAM activity was lower at the Lake site. (4) Recycling of respiratory CO2 was a major route for nocturnal acid synthesis. Nocturnal net uptake of atmospheric CO2 was closely correlated with changes in titratable acidity, but accounted for only about 30% of the nocturnal increase in organic acids. (5) Mature shade leaves performed CAM only during the dry season, whereas in the wet season they showed atmospheric CO2 uptake exclusively in the light. (6) Independent of exposure or season, leaves less than about 12 wk old showed a C-3 pattern of diel gas exchange and the level of titratable acidity was high day and night. (7) The annual carbon budget of outer canopy leaves of C. uvitana in the Ceiba site was 1780 g CO2 m(-2) a(-1), and the average long-term water-use efficiency was 23 x 10(-3) g CO2 g(-1) H2O. (8) Vegetative growth was strongly seasonal. Branch length increment and leaf area development was much higher in the wet season. Mineral element contents in these evergreen plants showed no age-related changes, but a significant proportion of elements was retrieved before abscission.

J	Pakzad, HR; Ajalloeian, R				Pakzad, HR; Ajalloeian, R			Geochemistry of the Gavkhoni Playa lake brine	CARBONATES AND EVAPORITES												The Gavkhoni Playa Lake is located to the southeast of Esfahan, Iran. It is surrounded by the Varzaneh aeolian sand field to the west and alluvial/fluvial sediments to all other directions. It is typical of the few permanent lakes within closed drainage basins in Iran. The properties of intermittent fine-grained and coarse-grained silicielastic and finally fine-grained evaporite sediments suggest that the basin was influenced repeatedly by wet and dry periods. During periods of flooding, it had been a shallow permanent lake. With increasing aridity. the middle of the lake became increasingly restricted and shallower which resulted in the formation of a salt pan, contributing to the nature of the lake brine. Due to the enclosed nature of the lake system, the water chemistry of Gavkhoni Playa Lake is dominated by sodium and chloride ions but shows wide variations in composition and concentration through time and location. The percentage of Na+(1,012 to 10,3040 ppm), Cl- (4,118 to 19,9365 ppm), Mg2-(360 to 25,691 ppm), and K+(78 to 3,570 ppm) is highest toward the south and at a minimum in the north. Calcium content, ranging from 160 to 3,480 ppm, appears highest in the north. The percentage of strontium (5 to 292 ppm) with the highest value to the north, is extremely low in comparison to other elements. Sulfate is another abundant anion in the brines with the highest content of 22,051 ppm. Bicarbonate is a minor anion ranging from 73 to 450 ppm with the highest values to the north and west. The concentration Of Sulfate and bicarbonate does not change regularly in the brines from north to south, nor does it vary seasonally. The chemical analysis of the brine shows that it becomes progressively depleted in carbonate and sulfates from the margins to the center of the lake. It ultimately became a Na+(Mg2+), Cl- brine type in the nor-them section and a Na+, Mg2+, Cl- brine type in the central part of the lake. After complete desiccation, the mineral assemblage exhibited halite, camallite, bischofite, and tachyhydrite in abundance.						ajalloeian, Rassoul/0000-0001-9770-1695; Pakzad, Hamid Reza/0000-0001-8514-3155													0891-2556	1878-5212				JUN	2004	19	1					67	74		10.1007/BF03175196	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03175196													WOS:000221904400005
J	de Souza, LA; Freitas, CED				de Souza, Lucirene Aguiar; de Carvalho Freitas, Carlos Edwar			Fishing sustainability via inclusion of man in predator-prey models: A case study in Lago Preto, Manacapuru, Amazonas	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												We modeled a fishery's system with two types of fishermen, commercial and subsistence fishermen, who exploit the fish stock at the Amazonian floodplain lakes. In the first model, we combined the Lotka-Volterra equations with Verhulst's Logistic model, by inserting hydrological cycle oscillations. The second model was based on the equations proposed by Berryman, which reflect the predator's functional response in relation to the prey's population behavior, taking into account the hydrological cycle. In both models, commercial fishermen and local direct consumers (called riverside dwellers - riverines - in the model), were considered the only predators acting upon fishing stocks. Primary data were collected in 48 riverside homes throughout 2006. The total number of interviewees corresponds to 69.6% of the universe of homes in the community defined as study area. The riverines were the predators that showed capacity to eliminate the opponent predators (commercial fishermen). The best scenery obtained regarding the number of prey, was the one that showed only commercial fishermen in the region. On the other hand, the simulations show that the coexistence is possible among predators, and between predators and their prey. The seasonal model with functional response provides a better response in relation to the system's current situation and to the established modeling conditions than the Lotka-Volterra seasonal model. The seasonal model with functional response also showed a better response pattern in all scenarios, with oscillations taking place more gradually, both for variations associated with the flooding pulse and for relations between predators and prey.

J	Holopainen, AL; Lepistö, L; Niinioja, R; Rämö, A				Holopainen, Anna-Liisa; Lepistoe, Liisa; Niinioja, Riitta; Raemoe, Anita			Spatiotemporal and long-term variation in phytoplankton communities in the oligotrophic Lake Pyhajarvi on the Finnish-Russian border	HYDROBIOLOGIA												As part of the joint Finnish-Russian research and development project "Assessment of the ecological state of the transboundary waters", seasonal and spatial variations in the phytoplankton communities of Lake Pyhajarvi were studied in order to identify possible long-term (1963-2002) changes and to present recent data (since 2002) on phytoplankton biomass and species composition. Some changes in both phytoplankton biomass and species composition, particularly in the littoral zone and northern basins of the lake, were obvious at the end of the 1980s; in particular, the density of blue-greens increased during that period. Biomasses increased five-fold in 1980, decreased after 1990 and have remained low (0.14 mg l(-1)) to the present time. The effective water protection measures applied, especially reducing the phosphorus load from municipal wastewaters and airborne pollution, can now be seen to have improved the water quality. Although no significant temporal differences were found in phytoplankton biomass during the intensive biweekly sampling in 2002, considerable spatial variation was seen within the lake. An obvious change in the species composition of phytoplankton and an increase in biomass were seen even in the loaded parts of the lake. Despite the spatial differences in phytoplankton biomass and community structure, the changed species composition in the northern part of the lake indicated a clear recovery from the blue-green and Chrysophyceae dominated high biomass of the 1980s.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2008	599						135	141		10.1007/s10750-007-9203-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-9203-1													WOS:000252890800017

The status of whitefish population from Chuna Lake in the Lapland biosphere reserve Russia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The current state of whitefish population and their organisms have been investigated in subarctic Lake Chuna exposed to long-term air pollution from copper-nickel industry. Both annual and long-term heavy metals and acid oxides loads on the lake have been determined. A qualitative assessment has been made for water and bottom sediments. The investigation results have been compared with those of the archived data (the 1950s - 1960s studies) to, reveal a number of changes. The lifetime of whitefish has shortened, with early maturity and spawning. Pathological changes of whitefish inner organs occur more frequently. Assessment was made for the Cu and Ni concentrations in whitefish organs and tissues, the seasonal dynamics and peculiarities of metal accumulation in two different species. The revealed changes of the biological constituent of the lake ecosystem alongside with hydro-chemical indices of air-borne load is suggestive of adverse impact of long-term air-borne pollution on the Lake Chuna ecosystem.

SOURCE OF WATER-VAPOR OVERLYING PYRAMID LAKE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												During 1988 and 1989, a series of water-vapor extractions were conducted in the Pyramid Lake basin to determine the source of moisture that overlies the lake. Calculations of the isotopic and water-vapor balances were made from isotopic and meteorological data from the Pyramid Lake and Reno, Nevada, areas. The results indicate that in the warm season, most of the moisture that overlies the lake is derived from evaporation as opposed to advected moisture. Isotopic fluxes at the lake surface can be approximated by climatic data from the lake site, which simplifies the calculation of this input in numerical simulations of the isotopic evolution of the lake.

However, the interactions between microbial communities and carbon emissions in these sediments remain poorly understood. This study investigated carbon fluxes at the water-air interface in the mainstream of the Liao River, integrating environmental parameters and microbial communities within sediments to elucidate seasonal differences in carbon cycling mechanisms. The results highlighted the wet season as a hot period for CH4 and CO2 emissions, with fluxes in the lower reach (CH4: 78.6 +/- 55.79 mg m-2 & sdot;d-1; CO2: 4.82 +/- 1.59 g m-2 & sdot;d-1) notably exceeding those in other sections. During the wet season, Pseudomonadota (recently reclassified from Proteobacteria) predominated, whereas Acidobacteriota and Cyanobacteriota showed substantial increases in relative abundance by 41.87 % and 83.60 %, respectively, in the dry season. Methanoregula and Methanospirillum were significantly enriched in the lower reach (p < 0.05), with their abundance positively correlating with CH4 fluxes (r = 0.75). Methylocaldum reached peak abundance in the midstream (34.00 +/- 35.61 %) and exhibited a significant correlation with CO2 fluxes (p < 0.03). Structural equation modeling revealed that water parameters (standardized path coefficient = 1.45) were the primary factors influencing carbon fluxes during the wet season, whereas microbial-environmental interactions diminished in the dry season. This study offers microbiological insights into the river carbon cycle's response to hydrological changes and elucidates the microbial-driven mechanisms that make urbanized downstream areas hotspots for carbon emissions.					cui, lijuan/AAX-7996-2021														0013-9351	1096-0953				NOV 15	2025	285		2						122363	10.1016/j.envres.2025.122363	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2025.122363								40675534					WOS:001540939500002

However, our understanding of PFAS distribution within drinking water systems remains limited. This study employed a combination of targeted, suspect, and non-targeted screening techniques to investigate the distribution of PFAS in 16 drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) supplied by two distinct water sources: the Yangtze River and Lake Taihu and its surrounding water bodies. Specifically, four DWTPs using Yangtze River water were monitored throughout the four seasons, with samples collected from source water, critical points in the treatment process, and treated water. Twelve DWTPs using Lake Taihu and surrounding water sources were examined cross-sectionally, with samples collected from treated water and tap water. The results showed that total PFAS in the Lake Taihusourced systems exhibited inflection points at the 30th and 90th percentiles, unlike the more uniform distribution of PFOS + PFOA. This suggests contributions from both consumer and industrial sources of PFAS alternatives. Suspect and non-targeted screening identified 27 positive features, of which 10 were not detected in the targeted analysis, thereby broadening the scope of PFAS detection in drinking water. Furthermore, the relative potency factor (RPF) method was used to estimate the cumulative toxicity of PFAS mixtures, including alternatives, by calculating the perfluorooctanoic acid equivalent (PEQ). Computational toxicology and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to identify the toxicity targets of these alternatives, revealing the potential toxicity of 6:2FTSA in relation to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) basement membrane and glucose transport functions. This study reveals that alternative PFAS are commonly found in drinking water systems and pose potential health risks that warrant serious attention.						zhang, peng/0000-0003-2540-8515													0013-9351	1096-0953				NOV 15	2025	285		4						122581	10.1016/j.envres.2025.122581	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2025.122581								40812696					WOS:001581989500003

In waters of big rivers (the Vistula and the Odra rivers), lakes and tap water the annual average concentrations were similar to each other being from 1.4 to 1.9 Bq.dm(-3). These concentrations were similar to those in the precipitation in which they ranged from 1.7 to 2.2 Bq.dm(-3). The lowest tritium concentrations were found in waters of the Seashore Region rivers (average for 1994-1999 was 1.1 Bq.dm(-3)). The tritium concentrations in surface waters and in precipitation are still higher than that of natural level. The data obtained show that tritium concentration in the water of rivers might depend on the size of drainage area The observed seasonal variations of tritium concentration in the precipitation collected in Warsaw and at the Mount Sniezka indicate the stratospheric source of tritium. It was found that about 30% of tritium deposited with precipitation is removed to the Baltic Sea with river waters.																			0236-5731					JAN	2001	247	1					71	77		10.1023/A:1006775300812	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1006775300812													WOS:000167567300012

The ETS activity of ovigerous Daphnia females at in situ temperature ranged from 3.27 mul O-2 mg dw(-1) h(-1) in February to 20.91 mul O-2 mg dw(-1) h(-1) in July. Respiration rates at in situ temperature varied from 4.04 mul O-2 mg dw(-1)h(-1) in December to 18.68 mul O-2 mg dw(-1) h(-1) in July. The influence of four factors (temperature, body size, fecundity, genetic differences) on the metabolism were investigated. Both ETS activity and respiration rate significantly correlated with temperature. The proportion of hybrid D. cucullata x galeata in Daphnia community correlated significantly with respiration rate at in situ temperature and ETS activity at standard temperature also. ETS activity and respiration rate showed no significant correlation with body size and the fecundity of Daphnia, whereas ETS activity in D. hyalina x galeata and D. cucullata x galeata separately correlated with body size. ETS activity of D. hyalina x galeata also was correlated with fecundity. Hybrid D. hyalina x galeata had up to one third lower ETS activity than D. cucullata x galeata. The mean ETS/R ratio in the Daphnia community was 1.16 +/-0.28 (N= 12). The ETS/R ratio did not correlate significantly with temperature, body size, fecundity or the proportion of D. cucullata x galeata in the Daphnia community. Laboratory experiments showed that both hybrids had similar ETS/R ratios.

Previous studies had established a clear inverse relationship between [CH3Hg] in fish and the pH of lakes in this region. Here, we examined the pH dependency of [CH3Hg] in lake water and explored the partitioning of CH3Hg between water, seston, and fish as a function of pH. Results indicate that [CH3Hg] in lake water tends to increase as pH decreases, but that seasonal and spatial variability of [CH3Hg] in individual lakes confounds a simple analysis of the relationship. The partitioning of CH3Hg was related only weakly, if at all, to pH. Average partitioning coefficients (log k(d) = log (C(p)/C(w))) were higher for yearling yellow perch (6.0 to 6.5) than for seston (5.5 to 6.0) but did not vary significantly between lakes. This suggests that acidification has a stronger effect on the supply of CH3Hg to the ecosystem than on specific rates of uptake by the biota.

The annual runoff in the river is estimated as 9.75 x 106 m3 yr- 1, presenting a wellmarked seasonal variation. Waters are mainly of the Na-HCO3 type, presenting a mean temperature of 19.53 f 5.16 degrees C (median = 18.5 degrees C), reaching values as high as 38.5 degrees C, a mean EC equal to 325.24 f 177.77 mu S cm- 1 (median = 304.5 mu S cm- 1), and are slightly acid to basic (mean pH = 7.07 f 0.57; median = 7.1). Physico-chemical parameters and major-ion composition depict noticeable variations whenever hydrothermal discharges occur in the river channel. Besides mixing with hydrothermal discharges, water chemistry is also influenced by silicate weathering, processes also shown by the 13C/12C and 87Sr/86Sr isotopic ratios. The total amount of CO2 emitted along selected paths range between 20.5 t d- 1 and 23.8 t d-1, values higher than the ones calculated dividing the river channel in separate sections (13 t d- 1-15.5 t d-1), as the former values overestimates the area, thus leading to a higher overall flux calculation. CO2 flux for all the watershed, estimated considering the contribution of all tributaries, is in the range of 14.6 t d- 1 to 17.7 t d-1. Even if the CO2 flux associated to surface water bodies in the study area is much lower than soil diffuse emissions, results point out to the need to characterize C-based GHG emissions from rivers draining active volcanic areas.

This study presents an integrated framework-combining stable isotope tracing, PMF modeling, and EWQI-to examine spatio-temporal variations in water quality across China's Ulansuhai Lake basin. Integrated analysis of temporal and spatial sample ratios from 198 samples collected in April, July, and October 2023 revealed that 95 % of groundwater, 53 % of river water, and 15 % of lake water exceeded the EWQI drinking-water threshold (EWQI >= 100). Basin-wide water exhibited an alkaline character (mean pH 9.54), and 40 % of samples were classified as slightly saline (TDS 3000-10 000 mg/L). Source apportionment identified four main pollution contributors: evaporite dissolution (32.68 %), silicate dissolution (26.26 %), fluorine source and phosphorus source (23.96 %), and nitrogen source (17.10 %). Spatially, 27 % of eastern groundwater samples showed significant agricultural impacts, whereas western groundwater pollution was dominated by evaporite (50 %) and silicate (28 %) dissolution. Irrigation is a key driver of increased nitrogen pollution, and evaporite and silicate dissolution and fluorine-phosphorus release are characterized by significant seasonal variations. Water-rock interactions contribute to increased salinity and the release of fluorine and phosphorus when the water table drops, and irrigation activities also contribute to nitrogen mobilization and transport, which can increase nitrogen contamination. These findings support sustainable water resource management and agricultural non-point source pollution mitigation arid and semi-arid lake basins.																			0269-7491	1873-6424				OCT 1	2025	382								126670	10.1016/j.envpol.2025.126670	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2025.126670								40516673					WOS:001513091800001
J	Harding, WR				Harding, WR			Phytoplankton primary production in a shallow, well-mixed, hypertrophic South African lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This paper reports on a two-year analysis of the wind climate and its effect on phytoplankton primary production in a shallow (mean depth = 1.9 m), hypertrophic South African coastal lake, Zeekoevlei. The lake is subject to continuous mixing of the euphotic zone (Z(eu) = 0.8 m), and complete mixing of the water column to the mean depth on a daily basis. Median annual wind speeds, prevailing from either the north or the south, were 6.4 m s(-1). There was an almost total absence of calms, measured as hourly mean wind speeds of <1 m s(-1). Notwithstanding the high frequency of mixing, the lake supports a dense population of phytoplankton, dominated by Cyanophyte and Chlorophyte species. Mean concentrations of chlorophyll-a were 240 mu g 1(-1). The attenuation of photosynthetically available radiation, PAR, was high, with mean K-d values of 6.4 m(-1) and water transparencies of <0.5 m. Levels of primary productivity, determined using the light and dark bottle oxygen method, were very high, comparable to or exceeding that of the most productive systems yet studied. Maximum volumetric productivity ranged from 525 to 1524 mg C m(-3) h(-1), and was confined to the upper 0.5 m of the water column. Daily areal productivity, Sigma P-d, varied between 1.2 and 4.3 g C m(-2) d(-1), and that of the maximum chlorophyll-a specific photosynthetic rate, p(max)(B), between 1.6 and 7.9 mg C (mg Chl-a)(-1) h(-1). Primary production was limited by water temperature and the attenuation of PAR. The high frequency of wind-induced mixing resulted in regular mixing of the phytoplankton through the euphotic zone, and reduced the overall importance of P-max at a single layer in the depth profile. Similarly, the regularity of mixing was recognized as a limitation of the incubation of bottle chains to determine primary production levels.																			0018-8158					JAN 31	1997	344						87	102		10.1023/A:1002954311328	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1002954311328													WOS:A1997XB54800010
J	Zou, HX; Sheng, GY; Sun, C; Xu, OY				Zou, HX; Sheng, GY; Sun, C; Xu, OY			Distribution of organic contaminants in Lake Taihu	WATER RESEARCH												Water contamination in Lake Taihu and Lake Wulihu poses a threat to water supply and recreation. Water samples were collected during 1988-1989 for analysis of organic contaminants in the two lakes. Over 800 organic contaminants were detected by GC and CC-MS, and 84 of them were screened by a scoring system as priority contaminants. Results showed that the average concentration was one order of magnitude higher in Lake Wulihu than in Lake Taihu, although the number of contaminants in Lake Wulihu was only double those in Lake Taihu. Concentrations of phthalates, halohydrocarbons, and alkanes in Lake Taihu were close to those in Lake Wulihu, whereas the concentrations of alkylaromatics, anilines, phenols, alcohols, ketones, and polynuclear aromatics in Lake Taihu were lower than in Lake Wulihu by 2-3 orders of magnitude. The average concentration of contaminants in Lake Taihu reaches the highest during the rainy season while this occurs in Lake Wulihu during the dry season because of differences in water Row patterns in the lakes, conditions of the water environment, and physico-chemical properties of contaminants.

THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND FILAMENTOUS ALGAE MAT FORMATION IN TWO AGRICULTURAL INFLUENCED SOUTH AFRICAN RIVERS	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												The regulation of nutrient inputs into rivers dominated by agriculture land use activities is an important aspect of ecological resilience of aquatic systems and the management of river eutrophication. The overabundance of benthic filamentous algae mats in river systems due to nutrient enrichment can modify the habitats of macroinvertebrate and fish communities as well as clogging irrigation crop sprayers of downstream water users. The current study examined over a period of 2 years (2013-2014) the interplay between physical and chemical river characteristics and epilithic filamentous algae biomass in two South African agricultural influenced rivers. The study area consisted of the Touw and Duiwe Rivers, which run into a proclaimed Ramsar site, namely, the Wilderness Lake System. A strong positive correlation was observed between the maximum filamentous algae biomass (97 chl-a mgm(-2)) observed during the dry season and the average water column alkalinity > 30 mg l(-1). The benthic trophic status of the nine sampling sites during the dry seasons indicated the highest benthic algae biomass with mesotrophic (1.7-21 chl-a mgm(-2)) to hypertrophic (> 84 chl-a mgm(-2)) conditions. During the dry season, only three sampling sites were below the suggested guideline value (35 mu g l(-1)) for total phosphorus (TP), while four sampling sites were below the total nitrogen guideline of 252 mu g l(-1). In the wet season, two sites were below TP values with five sites below total nitrogen guideline values. From the data gathered, it was evident that water column alkalinity and hardness were the main drivers for the formation or absence of benthic filamentous algae mats in the two river systems and that nitrogen and/or phosphorus concentrations was overshadowed by the physical and chemical characteristics of the river systems at certain sites. Nutrient results for the river bottom sediments revealed that the sediment qualities were variable at the different sampling sites, but more specifically along the longitudinal paths of flow. It was apparent that the high TP concentrations in the water column and bottom sediment, which were lowest during the dry season, were associated with the highest epilithic filamentous algae mat formation. The outcome of the current study shows that a more holistic approach must be followed for the development of future eutrophication guidelines and nutrient thresholds in South African rivers influenced by agriculture land use activities.

The measurements were carried out in central Eurasia (northern Tien Shan, Lake Issyk Kul) by the spectroscopic method with the use of the sun as a radiation source. The changes of mean monthly and annual values of the atmospheric components studied were considered. The correlation and spectral analyses of the measurement results were made. Seasonal and other variations with different periods and trends were revealed: positive for water vapor, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide contents and for spectral transparencies and negative for ozone content. A statistical model was used to describe these variations. The measurement results were compared to one another and to some meteorological and geophysical parameters and phenomena.

J	Batten, DJ; Dutta, RJ; Knobloch, E				Batten, DJ; Dutta, RJ; Knobloch, E			Differentiation, affinities and palaeoenvironmental significance of the megaspores Arcellites and Bohemisporites in Wealden and other Cretaceous successions	CRETACEOUS RESEARCH												The ultrastructure of the exine (protective wall) of the Wealden (Lower Cretaceous) megaspore species Arcellites hexapartitus is very similar to that of two other species, A. disciformis and A. santacrucensis, first recovered from mid Cretaceous formations in Greenland and Argentina respectively. The wall of Wealden A. vectis differs in that the outer exoexinal layer is thinner, but it is otherwise similar. The morphology of these and several other taxa from Barremian and younger Cretaceous deposits coupled with, in some cases, an association with the microspore Crybelosporites, suggests derivation from a single, now extinct, group of plants within the water fern order Marsileales. A. medusus differs somewhat from this group of species in the construction of both the neck around the triradiate suture and the wall. The oldest Wealden specimens are Valanginian. The possibility that diminutive examples might be its microspores suggests a different evolutionary lineage, perhaps linked to Aptian and younger Ariadnaesporites. Megaspores hitherto considered to belong to the same group as Arcellites, and therefore usually identified as A. pyriformis, first appear in Berriasian deposits in the Wealden succession. The construction of the neck of this spore has, however, led to the suggestion that the species should perhaps be referred to a different genus. Bohemisporites was erected just over 10 years ago to accommodate apparently identical Czech specimens, but has been little used since then. The structure of the wall of both British and Czech material, which includes a well-ordered exoexinal layer, confirms that assignment to this genus is appropriate. Although the spores may be derived from plants that grew in or near water, reference to the water fern group is now questioned. Links with the lycopsid order Selaginellales are possible. Regardless of the origins of the megaspores discussed, their palynological associations and recovery in abundance from sediments laid down in quiet freshwater bodies (ponds, lakes, disused river channels) render all of them useful indicators of environmental conditions and composition of local vegetation, and might also support inferences from other data for a seasonal climate during much of the period of deposition of the Wealden succession.

J	CYR, H; PACE, ML				CYR, H; PACE, ML			GRAZING BY ZOOPLANKTON AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO COMMUNITY STRUCTURE	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Zooplankton can consume a substantial portion of the phytoplankton, but grazing rates are notoriously variable seasonally and among sites. We developed models relating grazing rates to characteristics of zooplankton communities, food concentration, and water temperature. Grazing rates were measured in 30 zooplankton communities that differed in biomass, size distribution, and taxonomic composition. Crustaceans grazed per day 2-21 % of the chlorophyll in algae <35-mu-m, which is within the range of most grazing rates measured in other studies. Grazing rates were positively related to zooplankton biomass and negatively related to food concentration, although much variation among communities remains unexplained (R2 = 0. 1 9-0.35). Surprisingly, we could not detect a general relationship between zooplankton size distribution and grazing rate. Communities dominated by large zooplankton (mostly Daphnia and Diaphanosoma) did not tend to have higher grazing rates than communities dominated by small zooplankton. Zooplankton taxonomic composition was significantly related to grazing rates but explained little variation among communities. Grazing rates calculated from published allometric equations were biased, usually overestimating phytoplankton removal by zooplankton.

J	Kaya, Y				Kaya, Yunus			Slope-aware and self-adaptive forecasting of water levels: a transparent model for the Great Lakes under climate variability	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Real-time forecasting of water levels and surface-area dynamics is vital for climate-responsive management in the Great Lakes Basin. A slope-aware, Multi-Scale Weighted-Slope Regression (MS-WSR) model was developed, combining daily calendar lags for seasonal memory and multi-scale linear-trend slopes (1, 7, and 14-day) for evolving trend momentum. Coefficients are updated online via Recursive Least Squares (RLS) with an adaptive forgetting factor, allowing regime shifts to be tracked while damping isolated shocks. When applied to 65 years (1958-2023) of 6-min interval water-stage records from 42 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) gauges (six lakes, three rivers; 80 % training/20 % testing), the MS-WSR model achieved the lowest errors (Root Mean Square Error-RMSE = 0.07 m; MAE = 0.04 m; MAPE < 5 %; R-2 = 0.94; Pearson's r = 0.97) and sustained r > 0.85 up to five years ahead (+/- 10-day phase bias). Annual surface-area changes (1985-2023) were quantified via the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) on Landsat imagery in Google Earth Engine (GEE), revealing strong spatiotemporal coherence with stage trends. The transparency, low latency, and scalability of MS-WSR recommend it as an alternative to black-box models for early warning, reservoir management, and resilient infrastructure design.

Dolores			Infectious disease risk after the October 2024 flash flood in Valencia, Spain: Disaster evolution, strategic scenario analysis, and extrapolative baseline for a One Health assessment	ONE HEALTH												The flash flood caused by a cold front occurred beside Valencia city, Spain, on 29 October 2024, was of unprecedented devastation, catastrophic effects and health impact. A fast response initiative was launched to assess the risks of individual infections and infectious epidemics. This early release of results is meant to ease the diagnostic work by hospitals dealing with infected patients and helping to improving preventive infrastructures and action protocols. Infectious agents were searched for in environmental samples of flood water, mud and soil collected during the first three post-flood weeks, mainly focusing on affected core areas. The evolving scenario was followed covering previous days, disaster and post-flood days, and throughout subsequent weeks. The affected geography was mapped to assess water flow trajectories and confluent multidisciplinary circumstances related to short-, mid-and long-term infection risks. The appropriate survey planning distinguished four independent river/ravine basins, each one comprising four different types of sylvatic, rural-agricultural-farming, urban, and lake surrounding areas. A schematic workflow for analytical procedures is provided. A wide diversity of infectious agents was found, with higher concentration rates in mud than in flood waters. Environmental samples included viruses, bacteria, protozoans, opportunistic free-living amoebae, helminths, and vector groups of mosquitos, sandflies and freshwater snails. Transmission characteristics, human infection sources and pathogenicity are summarized for each pathogen found. Potentially emerging vector-borne diseases are analyzed. Detected microorganisms are of different transmission types, from direct to zoonotic, infection sources from oral to transcutaneous and wound infection, from short-to long-term life cycles, and from permanent to seasonal transmission. Fecal contamination showed high rates and indicated both human and animal sources, with potential reservoirs such as sheep, goats, pigs, equids, dogs and cats. The very large flooded zone requires a multidisciplinary One Health approach. Many lessons should be learned by both professionals in involved disciplines and related decision makers in governments. The large heterogeneity, complexity and far-reaching health consequences of the disaster furnish an extrapolative baseline model which may be useful to face similar catastrophic climate events in the future, expected to occur according to current climate change trends, both throughout the Mediterranean basin and elsewhere.

We considered both foraging efficiency and energetic efficiency as a combined effect which we called growth maximization. The importance of growth maximization as a selective force was evaluated with a bioenergetics-based model to estimate growth rates of various migration scenarios of kokanee salmon, Oncorhychus nerka. Environmental parameters (temperature and zooplankton distributions) in the model were obtained from a North Carolina reservoir with an established population of kokanee. The simulations demonstrated that vertical migrations can be energetically advantageous when kokanee and their prey are thermally segregated and that ontogenetic and seasonal differences in the optimal migration strategy should be expected. The general rule for vertical migration as determined from the simulations is to feed where net energy intake is maximized and then reside when not feeding where energetic costs are minimized and food is digested to the point that consumption during the next feeding period is not limited by the amount of undigested food remaining in the stomach. Data obtained from vertical gill nets and hydroacoustics were compared with model predictions.																			0706-652X					NOV	1993	50	11					2236	2349		10.1139/f93-258	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f93-258													WOS:A1993MZ45600006

We compared the reliability of predicting the relative abundance of macroinvertebrates in boreal wetlands using either the number of macroinvertebrates collected at one sampling period, or presence or absence of fish. Wetlands with fish had fewer macroinvertebrates than fishless wetlands in all five sampling periods. Predictions of the relative abundance of invertebrates in a wetland at other sampling periods based on the presence or absence of fish, were equal to or better than predictions based on the actual number of macroinvertebrates collected during one sampling period. These results suggest that fish status of a wetland is a reliable cue to invertebrate abundance in boreal wetlands.

Wayondo Formation palaeo-Alfisols located on Rusinga Island (Gumba Beds) and at nearby Karungu, which were deposited prior to the commencement of the main phase of volcanic activity (17.8 Ma), possess well developed clay horizons, moderate base cation contents and strong degrees of weathering. These palaeosols, when compared to their unweathered granitic parent exhibit collapse and loss of 80-90% of base cations and silica suggesting that their formation was during a period of landscape stability, when climatic conditions were humid to sub-humid. In comparison the overlying Kiahera Formation palaeosols, which were deposited during hydromaginatic activity at Kisingiri, exhibit a wide range of dilation and addition, together with individual elemental losses of up to 50%. Together, these weathering trends suggest that there was a climatic shift from wetter conditions to drier, semi-arid conditions, during the initial stages of the volcanoe's growth. This is supported by delta(13)C values of soil organic matter from A-horizons of the Wayondo Formation palaeosols (Rusinga Island -25.9parts per thousand and Karungu -25.0parts per thousand) and the volcanically derived Hiwegi Formation (-23.2parts per thousand) and Kiahera Formation (-24.2parts per thousand) palaeosols. While all delta(13)C values are indicative of vegetation using the C3 synthetic pathway, delta(13)C values of the palaeosols that formed during the eruption (Hiwegi and Kiahera) show more 13 C-enriched values compared with the pre-volcanic palacosols (Wayondo). The reason for the relatively C-13-enriched values is suggested to be due to reduced fractionation due to seasonal or year-round water stress in an environment that had changed from humid (Wayondo) to sub-humid/semi-arid with the onset of volcanic activity. The greater abundance of calcareous material within these syn-eruptively formed fossil soils, compared with the pre-volcanic ones, also supports a change towards greater aridity. delta(13)C values of organic matter from the Kulu Lake Beds (in the Hiwegi Formation) have average delta(13)C value of -25.4parts per thousand. However, it is not possible to determine whether these values reflect the VC values of the terrestrial vegetation of the watershed or whether they are dominated by lacustrine-produced organic matter. Our data indicate that the well-developed Gumba and Karungu fossil soils of the Wayondo Formation represent part of a sustained stable alluvial system and had formed under humid conditions. With the onset of volcanic activity and the creation of a rapidly aggrading pyroclastic system, on which the Kiahera, Kulu and Hiwegi Formations of the Rusinga Group formed, changes occurred in the weathering regime and in the delta(13)C values of organic matter, suggesting a change towards greater aridity in the pre-versus syn-volcanically formed palaeosols.

J	McDonald, ME; Tikkanen, CA; Axler, RP; Larsen, CP; Host, G				McDonald, ME; Tikkanen, CA; Axler, RP; Larsen, CP; Host, G			Fish simulation culture model (FIS-C): A bioenergetics based model for aquacultural wasteload application	AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING												A generic bioenergetics model for chinook salmon was modified to estimate solid wastes from a commercial net-pen aquaculture operation in a Minnesota mine-pit lake. The model was calibrated using data from the operation on growth, ration, and temperature. Multiple simulations were run to form three-dimensional response surfaces for consumption, egestion, excretion and respiration as a function of fish size and water temperature. These formed the basis for the Fish Simulation Culture (FIS-C) Model. Predictions for food consumption and solids load were compared with actual ration levels and sedimentation within the mine-pit lake from 1989 to 1992, and compared well with the general trends of the observed data. However, the actual predictive power of FIS-C was very sensitive to our initial model assumption that aquaculture operations are predicated on maximizing the growth of their stock. FIS-C currently does not account for management decisions electing sub-optimal stock growth, but under these conditions does estimate a worst case loading scenario for the system. The annual phosphorus load to the system predicted by FIS-C was not significantly different from that of the mean of 17 values of annual P-load estimated empirically from the literature. However, FIS-C's estimate of P-loading shows a pronounced seasonal pattern to the annual loading. FIS-C offers substantial benefits to users by estimating seasonal and shorter term food wastage and wasteloads to receiving waters under particular operating conditions. Then, other operational scenarios can be created to examine the effects of changing fish inventory, feeding schedule, food composition, etc., in order to examine the impacts on production, environmental and/or regulatory requirements, prior to costly implementation.																			0144-8609					JUN	1996	15	4					243	259		10.1016/0144-8609(96)00260-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0144-8609(96)00260-9													WOS:A1996UV88400002

Cladophora has increased in abundance and cover in the South Basin of Windermere, English Lake District, in recent years. During the growing seasons of 1992 and 1993, the maximum biomass of Cladophora in the South Basin, at nearly 200 g dry weight m(-2), was nearly six times greater and the percentage cover, at 95%, was nearly ten times greater than in the North Basin. 2. Nutrient analysis showed that Cladophora from the South Basin had significantly higher average contents of N than that from the North Basin. The suggested rate-limiting tissue N content, 1.3% of dry weight, was never reached in the South Basin but was reached in 20% of samples from the North Basin. In contrast, the average P content was not significantly different, at about 0.24% in both basins. The suggested rate-limiting P content, 0.16% of dry weight, was reached in 31% of the samples from the South Basin and 37% from the North Basin. 3. On average, the standing stock of P in the South Basin was 0.12 g m(-2), twelvefold that in the North Basin at 0.01g m(-2) and the standing stock of N in the South Basin was 1.81 g m(-2), elevenfold that in the North Basin at 0.16 g m(-2). Maximum standing stocks of P were 0.38 gm(-2) in the South and 0.05 g m(-2) in the North Basin. Maximum standing stocks of N were 5.02 g m(-2) in the South and 0.60 g m(-2) in the North Basin. 4. The maximal rate of PO4-P uptake ranged between 298 and 2949 mu g P g(-1) DW h(-1) and the specific affinity varied between 2.9 and 24.3 mu g P g(-1) DW h(-1) (mg PO4-P m(-3))(-1). The higher values of both characteristics are within the range which is believed to indicate severe P limitation. 5. Using the nutrient uptake characteristics, rates of uptake at pelagic and littoral concentrations of PO4-P were calculated to be between 0.1 and 1.7% of the maximal rates apart from one site where rates were up to 5.6% of V-max1 and 40% of V-max1 based on pelagic and littoral concentrations of PO4-P, respectively. Despite these generally low rates of uptake, calculations suggest they were just sufficient to account for the measured rate of increase of P standing stock, assuming no biomass loss. Similar calculations suggested that pelagic concentrations of NO3-N could support between 21 and 30% of maximal rates and these were between four and six times (North Basin) and twenty-five times (South Basin) the observed rates of increase in N standing stock. Littoral concentrations of N03-N were similar and so would have allowed similar rates. 6. Evidence from nutrient tissue contents, standing stocks and rates of uptake suggests that the growth of Cladophora, in both basins of Windermere, is controlled primarily by the availability of P.

Two methods for estimating the average body size at the onset of reproduction were applied to populations of Daphnia hyalina. The first,'average maturation size', assesses maturity by the relative length of abdominal processes of Daphnia; the second,'size at first reproduction' (SFR), calculates the size class in which 50% of the maximum proportion of egg-bearing females is reached. 2. The influence of environmental factors on the expression of the difference in length between the first and the second abdominal process was tasted in the laboratory. Neither temperature nor chemical cues from predators affected the difference in length, but the processes were indistinguishable at very low food concentrations. 3. During one season, D. hyalina exhibited pronounced changes in fecundity, proportion of egg-bearing adults and SFR. The pattern obtained by the two methods was similar in many cases, although maturation size estimated by the first method was slightly smaller than SFR obtained by the second method. Neither method gave reliable results during times of starvation (clear-water phase).																			0046-5070					DEC	1993	30	3					433	438		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1993.tb00826.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1993.tb00826.x													WOS:A1993MN34700009

The seasonal cycle of C. pengoi in the shallow waters off the north-eastern coast of the Gulf of Finland was studied from the end of June to October 1996. In early August females bearing resting eggs constituted 13-67 % of the total population of C. pengoi. The start of the production of resting eggs corresponded with the period of elevated water temperature and with an increase in population density of C. pengoi. A comparison with published data on reproduction of cercopagids revealed a considerable difference in timing and intensity of resting egg production between the Caspian and Baltic populations of C. pengoi. The adaptive significance of changes in the mode of reproduction and in the mass production of resting eggs for survival of C. pengoi in the novel environment is discussed.

Diapausing eggs from a temporary-pond population of Daphnia pulex were examined for hatching response in six combinations of two temperatures and three photoperiods. Alternating seven day periods of cold (4 degrees C) and complete dark with seven day treatments of warm temperature (10 degrees C; 17 degrees C) and photoperiod (10L:14D; 14L:10D; 18L:06D) was an effective strategy for terminating diapause. Conditions mimicking the natural pond environment during the early growing season elicited the greatest hatching success. We observed no correlation between size of ephippium and subsequent hatching success or timing of hatching. Both outbred and inbred diapausing eggs showed a significant response to temperature.

Within the ambit of these dynamics, a stucco mantelpiece was taken into consideration. Nothing was known about the object: neither its origin, nor the artist who produced it, nor the period of execution. Historical, stylistic and formal analyses of the materials and of the technique with which the work was executed allow us to verify that the mantelpiece was produced using the stucco technique in the 17th century, in Rovio (southern Switzerland, Ticino), and that it comes from one of the exponents of the Carlone workshop, whose representatives were important in the tradition of itinerant artistic workers. Due to their good technical and professional specialization, the Carlone workshop served both public and private buyers. Tommaso Carlone is the principal representative artist of the Carlone workshop; it is certain that his workshop produced the stucco mantelpiece. The migrations of the artists were seasonal and they maintained a close bond with their country of origin. When they returned to the country of origin, they produced works of great artistic value, of which the mantelpiece represents a splendid example. Through the employment of conventional analytical techniques (optical and electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy and porosity measurements), it has been possible to study the technique with which the work was executed, the materials used and the decay. The mantelpiece was produced using the stucco technique by means of a body layer (slaked lime and silicate and carbonate aggregates) and a marmorino finishing layer (slaked lime and pointed calcite crystals). Above this layer, whose thickness varies in relation to the executed result, there is a thin lime plaster whitewash, pigmented with the dispersion of yellow ochre particles; chromatic alterations are an oxalate patina caused by firm adhesion to the marmorino layer, due to the denaturation of the proteic substances employed. The final treatment was made with beeswax, which increased the marmoreal effect. Several additional layers of lime plaster whitewash have also been applied over the centuries. The figurative central square of the plastic decoration was made using red ochre.																			0003-813X					MAY	2005	47		2				425	439		10.1111/j.1475-4754.2005.00211.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-4754.2005.00211.x													WOS:000229975400016

However, the protected area does not include lake Mangueira, the Taim's main water source, which is surrounded by intensive rice farming. Rice irrigation demands a large proportion of water during the dry season (40. 000 m(3)/year out of 50, 000 m(3)/vear inflow to the lake). A severe drought (1989-1991) almost dried the Taim wetland resulting in legal actions to enforce the conservation status. As a consequence, several studies were undertaken to elucidate the Taim's hydrological behavior, and to determine adequate water resources management policies. Results show that the ecosystem cannot withstand the present rate of water extraction. The two problems are. (i) defining a suitable plan to manage water extraction, and (ii) ensuring that the farmers respect it. A plan has been proposed which includes forecasting the available volume and the complementary use of water from the nearby lake Mirim. The final form of the regulations, and their enforcement procedures, are under discussion with federal law enforcement officers. federal and state environmental and water resources agencies, and farmers.						da Motta Marques, David/0000-0002-3809-8053													0250-8060					DEC	2000	25	4					610	616		10.1080/02508060008686876	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02508060008686876													WOS:000167322200013

Ebinur Lake, the largest salt inland lake in Xinjiang, Northwest China, has experienced rapid shrinkage, with human activities identified as the primary influencing factor. However, it remains unclear how human water use in different sectors, such as irrigation, husbandry, and industry, is responsible for the long-term change and seasonal variability of the lake area under changing climate. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by developing an integrated hydrological-socioeconomic-lake model that simulates the changes in the Ebinur Lake area during the period of 1950-2020. The simulated lake area changes under different model experiments were then compared with separate the impacts of climate change and human water use of different sectors. The results indicate that climate change, irrigation, husbandry, and industry water uses have contributed +5%, -79%, -25%, and -1% of the long-term change in the lake area, respectively. Despite climate change alone increasing the lake area, the increase in human water use has resulted in the persistent decline of Ebinur Lake. Notably, husbandry water use emerges as a significant contributor to lake shrinkage, accounting for approximately one-third of the impact of irrigation. Furthermore, irrigation water use has contributed to the enhanced seasonal variability, as indicated by the difference between the maximum and minimum monthly lake area in a year. This difference has increased from 120 km2 in the 1950s to 183 km2 in the 2010s.

In addition to the well-investigated greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) may be emitted from freshwater ecosystems, especially from small water bodies, but the composition of emitted VOCs and emission magnitudes remain largely undescribed. Referring to empirical great contributors of freshwater greenhouse gases, we assessed seasonal VOC emissions from three carbon and nutrient-rich ponds in a peatland forest in Denmark. These ponds were CO2 emitters throughout the sampling period (19.5 +/- 67.7 to 396.8 +/- 120.0 mg m(-2) h(-1)). The total net fluxes of > C5 VOCs measured in situ ranged from 7.8 +/- 1.4 to 95.3 +/- 4.5 mu g m(-2) h(-1) and over one hundred compounds were detected. The emissions consisted mainly of hydrocarbons, oxygenated VOCs, and terpenoids (isoprene, monoterpenoids, and sesquiterpenoids). We found the in situ VOC fluxes and compositions varied with season and were positively correlated with chamber temperature. These fluxes also differed between ponds and were related to the chemical properties of pond water. Additionally, we observed emissions of significant and various lighter VOCs (< C5) and sulfur/nitrogen-containing compounds in complementary lab measurements and demonstrated again the temperature dependence and pond-to-pond heterogeneity of VOC emissions. Overall, our findings indicate natural eutrophic ponds are net VOC sources. The significance of these emissions for carbon budgets and atmospheric impact requires future research.

However, there is paucity of information on zooplankton community structure in Lake Tana's northern gulf. Therefore, this study aimed to provide baseline information on the spatio-temporal variations in zooplankton assemblages in Lake Tana's northern gulf, focusing on water quality parameters. Data were collected from five sampling sites from May 2023 to April 2024. Forty-five zooplankton species belonging to three groups (17 Rotifera, 14 Copepoda, and 13 Cladocerans) were identified. Rotifers were the most species-rich group, with Brachionus angularis, B. caudatus, B. falcatus, B. havanaensis, and Keratella tropica being the most abundant. Significant (p < 0.05) spatial variations in zooplankton diversity, evenness, and dominance were recorded. Shannon index values ranged from H '=2.98 for the GOR site to H '=3.49 for the MEG site. Evenness values varied between 0.52 and 0.74, indicating less uniform distribution. Zooplankton taxa were rare at the water hyacinth-infested site probably due to stress from low light and reduced temperature. Copepods and rotifers showed resilience to survive in the slightly polluted water of the littoral region, while cladocerans preferred the clear pelagic water. Zooplankton community structure showed a similar pattern across all sites, with minimum (27) and maximum (36) species richness occuring during the rainy and post rainy seasons, respectively. Generally, the spatio-temporal variations in water quality parameters had implications for zooplankton community structure.

J	WILLIAMS, WD				WILLIAMS, WD			CHINESE AND MONGOLIAN SALINE LAKES - A LIMNOLOGICAL OVERVIEW	HYDROBIOLOGIA												More than half of China's lakes are saline (viz. have salinities > 3 g L-1). Most salt lakes are in northwestern China (Tibet, Qinghai, Sinkiang, Inner Mongolia). Most Mongolian salt lakes are in the west of that country. Tectonic movements have been of the greatest importance in lake origins, but aeolian activity and deflation have also played a role. Many salt lakes in Qinghai-Tibet lie at altitudes > 4000 m.a.s.l.; Aiding Hu (Sinkiang) lies at -154 m.a.s.l. Again, many lakes are large in area and deep. Small, shallow lakes are also common. Dimictic thermal patterns prevail in deep lakes, polymictic patterns in shallow ones. The highest salinity recorded is 555 g L-1. The salinity of Qinghai Lake, the largest Chinese salt lake, is 14 g L-1, but mean lake salinity on the northern Tibetan plateau is about an order of magnitude greater. Lop Nor has a salinity of approximately 5 g L-1. Dominant ions are Na and Cl; Mg, Ca, SO4 and HCO3 + CO3 are important in certain lakes. Most major ions originate by weathering and leaching from rocks. pH values are generally high (often > 9.0). There are no bird or fish species confined to salt lakes, though many are associated with lakes of low or moderate salinity. Artemia occurs widely inland and in coastal salt pans, but is the only major macroinvertebrate of highly saline lakes. In lakes of only low to moderate salinity, invertebrate communities comprise widespread halotolerant freshwater forms and halophiles, some regionally endemic. Submerged and emergent macrophytes occur in lakes of low salinity, but phytoplankton species are more halotolerant. Ctenocladus circinatus, a green alga, is known from a Tibetan salt lake with a salinity of 200 g L-1. There is a dearth of basic limnological information on Chinese and Mongolian salt lakes. More work in particular is needed on a variety of geographically widespread lakes to (a) document seasonal physicochemical events, and (b) compile comprehensive biological inventories of taxa present. Chinese salt lakes are significant sites for palaeoclimatic research, for conservation purposes, and for the resolution of several important biological questions (especially of an ecological and biogeographical sort). They also have important economic values. Unfortunately, the natural existence of many appears to be threatened by decreased inflows, largely the result of human impact on catchments.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR 1	1991	210	1-2					39	66		10.1007/BF00014322	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00014322													WOS:A1991FF63500005

The stability of these compounds in the wetland was shown to be highly variable both temporally and spatially, indicating that apparent manganese removal based on water quality data did not result in long-term manganese retention in sediments. Contour maps of the gel probe data revealed the importance of local environmental conditions, such as surface water velocity, on geochemical conditions influencing manganese compound stability in sediments, as well as seasonal changes in the ability of the wetland to retain MnO2 in sediments. Estimates of in situ MnO2 reduction rates using gel probe data agree with earlier published estimates based on laboratory studies. Although the factors influencing particulate metal stability in sediments are extremely complex and difficult to study, the redox gel probe method is demonstrated to be a cost-effective means of obtaining an areal and depth-related picture of that stability during a particular period of time.																			0149-0451					SEP-OCT	2002	19	5					485	504		10.1080/01490450290098450	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490450290098450													WOS:000178512700002

J	Mohr, S; Adrian, R				Mohr, S; Adrian, R			Effects of Brachionus calyciflorus and Brachionus rubens on a manipulated freshwater microbial community	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												In situ grazing experiments were conducted in a highly eutrophic lake during May and June 1998 to examine species-specific predatory effects of the closely related rotifers Brachionus calyciflorus and Brachionus rubens on the microbial community (<56 μm lake fraction). From functional response experiments with ciliates we know that B. calyciflorus feeds more efficiently on large ciliate prey such as Coleps sp. than does B. rubens. To test these different food-size preferences under natural conditions we manipulated the natural microbial community by adding the ciliate Coleps sp. in thepresence and absence of B. calyciflorus and B. rubens. Both brachionids had a considerable predatory impact on the microbial community of Lake Muggelsee. Brachionus calyciflorus had strong negative effects on large ciliates like Coleps sp., large heterotrophic nanoflagellates, and large autotrophic flagellates while B. rubens generally preferred the smaller size classes. Bacteria abundances and chlorophyll a concentrations generally remained unaffected. The different predatory impacts of the two rotifer species on the close to natural food conditions match results from previous single-species functional response experiments. Thus, the nature of predatory effects of brachionids in the field are probably predictable from laboratory experiments.																			0142-7873					JAN	2002	24	1					25	31		10.1093/plankt/24.1.25	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/24.1.25													WOS:000173635200003

Zooplankton, a primary natural food source in aquaculture, plays a crucial role in maintaining ecosystem function. Thus, understanding how zooplankton communities respond to environmental changes is essential for economic and ecological outcomes. In this study, we examined three types of aquaculture ponds (crab, crayfish, and fish ponds) with over 10 years of history and analyzed 27 environmental factors potentially influencing zooplankton dynamics throughout the year. Our results showed that Rotifera was the most abundant group in all three pond types, followed by Protista, Cladocera, and Copepoda. The dominant species across different seasons and ponds were Polyarthra vulgaris, Anuraeopsis fissa, and Trichocerca pusilla. The alpha diversity of zooplankton was influenced by various environmental factors across different pond types, with significant effects of antibiotics observed only in the fish ponds. The temporal and spatial distributions of zooplankton communities varied significantly. Deterministic processes, driven primarily by temperature and ammonia nitrogen, were identified as the primary mechanisms influencing zooplankton community assembly in freshwater aquaculture ponds. These findings inform management practices aimed at regulating key environmental drivers and optimizing zooplankton dynamics, with implications for maintaining ecosystem stability and productivity and, ultimately, supporting sustainable aquaculture.

Wetland water quality was significantly affected by contact with the sediment (surface water vs. groundwater), season, degree of hydrologic isolation, wetland class, and predominant land-use in the surrounding watershed (p < 0.05). Between years, only nitrate and particulate nitrogen concentrations varied significantly in Wright County wetland surface waters. For eight water-quality variables, the power of a paired before-and-after comparison design was greater than the power of a completely randomized design. The reverse was true for four other water-quality variables. The power of statistical tests for different classes of water-quality variables could be ranked according to the predominant factors influencing these: climate factors > edaphic factors > detritivory > land-use factors > biotic-redox or other multiple factors. For two wetlands sampled intensively, soluble reactive phosphate and total dissolved phosphorus were the most spatially variable (c.v. = 76-249%), while temperature, color, dissolved organic carbon, and DO were least variable (c.v. = 6-43%). Geostatistical analyses demonstrated that the average distance across which water-quality variables were spatially correlated (variogram range) was 61-112% of the mean radius of each wetland. Within the shallower of the two wetlands, nitrogen speciation was explained as a function of dissolved oxygen, while deeper marsh water-quality variables were explained as a function of water depth or distance from the wetland edge. Compositing water-quality samples produced unbiased estimates of individual sample means for all water quality variables examined except for ammonium.																			0167-6369					MAR	1996	40	1					11	40		10.1007/BF00395165	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00395165								24198069					WOS:A1996TZ52000002

Since direct measurements of food are hampered by the lack of knowledge on the exact nature of the food in eutrophic conditions, indirect measurements are necessary to estimate the degree of food limitation in these circumstances. Hence, we used laboratory- and field-derived relationships between the body length and body carbon content of different species of Daphnia, which were collected from the highly eutrophic Tjeukemeer, the Netherlands. From a seasonal survey of the carbon content of the daphnids, we concluded that in Tjeukemeer D.galeata, D.galeata x cucullata and D.cucullata are food limited during the largest part of the year. Since the condition of the hybrids was relatively high as compared with the parental species when the food concentration was high. D.galeata x cucullata is expected to be the more successful taxon during periods of high food availability.

J	PIECZYNSKA, E				PIECZYNSKA, E			DETRITUS AND NUTRIENT DYNAMICS IN THE SHORE ZONE OF LAKES - A REVIEW	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The importance of detritus varies greatly among shore zones of lakes, but in a large majority of these regions detrital pathways prevail. Aside from a great spatial and seasonal variability, macrophytes and bottom sediments appear to be dominant stores of nutrients in these habitats. Macrophytes hold a central position in nutrient cycling in the shore-littoral lake zones. They are the main source of autochthonous detritus as they prevail in the total biomass of littoral organisms, and they are only rarely available as direct food of consumers. Various processes and interactions determine the role of macrophytes in nutrients dynamics. These are: the intensity of nutrient uptake and translocation, release of nutrients by healthy plants and from decomposing plants, exchange of elements between macrophytes and their periphyton, as well as interception of seston by macrophyte stands. Particular plant species differ in their time of dying and susceptibility to decomposition. The changes in decomposing material (size structure of particles and nutrient content) mean that detritus in various stages of decomposition differs in its role in trophic dynamics of shore-littoral lake zones. Several types of shore regions as regards detritus sources and retention level are discussed.																			0018-8158					FEB 5	1993	251	1-3					49	58		10.1007/BF00007164	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007164													WOS:A1993KX96900009

To fill the blank, ground water samples in dry and wet seasons, surface river water and paired sediment samples were collected in Sichuan province and analyzed for 14 kinds of OPEs and 7 m-OPEs. Except Trimethyl phosphate was scarcely detected, the other OPEs were extensively found in aquatic environment. The concentrations of Sigma 14OPEs and Sigma 7m-OPEs ranged from 45.0 to 231 ng/L and from 1.25 to 62.3 ng/L in ground water and ranged from 2.20 to 1709 and from 0.08 to 35.5 ng/L in surface water, respectively. Compared to other reports, the pollution in Minjiang and Tuojiang river was at medium level. The concentration ratios and correlation analysis between OPEs and m-OPEs indicated that OPEs in ground water had three main sources, and m-OPEs mainly came from direct usage. Low ecological risk was found for surface water. The carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks of OPEs in surface and ground water via ingestion and dermal contact in moderate and high exposure scenarios were assessed, and results suggested the risks to human which mainly caused by Tri(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate could be negligible.

Control of the Tomato Fruit Worm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) by Releasing the Egg Parasitoid, Trichogramma evanescens West. in Tomato Fields in Southern Egypt	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROL												Tomato is a major vegetable crop in the region of Nasser Lake, southern of Aswan Governorate, Egypt. The tomato fruit worm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is the most serious insect pest attacks tomato in the region. The egg parasitoid, Trichogramma evanescens Westwood (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) is the most common, native and widely distributed egg parasitoid species in Egypt. Efficacy of T evanescens for controlling H armigera in tomato fields in Nasser Lake region was studied. Field studies were carried out in three sites; Khor Abdel-Saied, Khor Elsuol and El-Daleel, Kalabsha district, Aswan Governorate, represented the largest tomato agricultural areas in the region, during the growing season 2005/06. Evaluation of T evanescens releases against H. armigera in the tomato fields was estimated as rate of larval infestation by direct count. The evaluation was undertaken to test different release rates, timings and number of releases of the parasitoid. All data were statistically analyzed. Obtained results showed that the treatment of 40,000 parasitoids/ feddan, four times at interval of 10 to 15 days at the flowering growth stage gave the best result as the average of infestation was 1.5 % compared to 5.5 % in the control, the reduction reached 72.7 %. In the other treatments, the infestation rate ranged between (1.9 and 2.5 %), with a reduction of (65.45 and 54.5 %), at the flowering growth stage, while it ranged between (2.5 and 3 %), with a reduction of (54.5 and 45.5 %), at the fruiting stage compared with the control. Cost benefit of using the T evanescens releases showed a saving of LE 852 (= 154.9 US $)/ feddan (= 387.3 US $/ hectare). Therefore, the release of 40,000 parasitoids/ release/ feddan, four times (12-15 days intervals) and starting by early tomato flowering growth stage is recommended for the using of T evanescens against H. armigera in Nasser Lake region.																			1110-1768						2010	20	1					21	26																WOS:000281306800004

Biogeography and taxonomy of New Zealand Cladocera (Anomopoda, Chydoridae): a review	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF NEW ZEALAND												Studies of the biogeography of Cladocera in New Zealand lakes are rare and only a few species of littoral chydorid Cladocera have been documented. Consequently, a number of issues relating to their taxonomy and systematics have yet to be resolved. The majority of chydorid Cladocera in the northern hemisphere have been given new names after a detailed investigation of their morphology and genetic variability. However, knowledge of their inter-hemispheric distribution is poor. It is likely that many species of chydorid Cladocera in the southern hemisphere, including in the New Zealand lakes, will show significant genetic variability from their northern hemisphere counterparts, although this has not yet been investigated. Here we review the taxonomy and biogeography of the New Zealand chydorid Cladocera. This is important when we consider the limited knowledge of New Zealand cladocerans and the consequent difficulties encountered by freshwater ecologists and paleolimnologists when using them to identify rapid environmental changes in the southern hemisphere.

Besides its culture function and aesthetic value, it is also an ideal target, which can be regarded as an enclosed and simplified ecosystem with little external pollution. The objective of the study is to determine the spatial and temporal dynamics in the relationship between phytoplankton and main limnological variables. An intensive observation and monitoring program was performed more than one year at six sampling points along five locally connected watercourses. Nutrient levels and their seasonal variables might be the main factors which control the temporal development of phytoplankton. Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) levels peaked from late August to September and showed a significant positive correlation with water temperature, turbidity, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and dissolved total phosphorus (DTP). Wind driven flow and geographical features appears to be the limiting factors for the spatial dynamics of phytoplankton. Higher average chl-a levels caused higher turbidity in the south and middle watercourses which are separated by dams and where shallow-circulation flow can be hardly maintained. Low average chl-a levels were recorded in the north watercourse in conditions of lower water levels, direct connection with the east watercourse and west watercourse and higher prevailing wind driven flow. The findings have strongly shown the influence of nutrients and hydro-meteorological variables as important factors of spatial and temporal dynamics of phytoplankton biomass.

The results revealed that total length (TL) at age 1 year was correlated with latitude and faster growth during the first growing season leads to a shorter lifespan in Europe. Variation in length at age 1 year was more pronounced in southern (40-46 degrees N: mean TL = 84.6 mm, SD = 27.2, n = 9) than in northern populations (49-61 degrees N: mean TL = 46.4 mm, SD = 4.2, n = 10).

Dominants include anostracans Parartemia spp., copepods Calamoecia spp., and ostracods Australocypris and related genera. A few species have colonised the saline lakes from terrestrial sources (e.g., the slater Haloniscus searlii; BAYLY & ELLIS 1969) and from the marine environment (e.g., the harpacticiod copepod Mesochra baylyi; BAYLY & WILLIAMS 1966). Although the salinity may be in the appropriate range, there are few invaders from the sea because the intermittent nature of most continental lakes means a survival mechanism for dry times is needed, and such are generally absent in marine species. At a few places on the long Australian coastline there are lakes that were once marine but are now transformed to intermittent continental waters, or still marine and maintaining contact via underground waters. Examples of the former occur in the Beachport-Robe area of South Australia (BAYLY 1970) and of the later on the west coast of Eyre Peninsula, South Australia (TIMMS 2009). These were and continue to be populated by marine species capable of living in waters isolated from the sea and hence are likely sites for marine invasion of continental saline lakes. I examined these cases with special reference to Blue Lagoon, via Penong, South Australia, a lake hitherto not mentioned in the literature.																			0368-0770		978-3-510-54080-8				2010	30		9				1425	1428																WOS:000312418900025
J	NADON, GC				NADON, GC			THE ASSOCIATION OF ANASTOMOSED FLUVIAL DEPOSITS AND DINOSAUR TRACKS, EGGS, AND NESTS - IMPLICATIONS FOR THE INTERPRETATION OF FLOODPLAIN ENVIRONMENTS AND A POSSIBLE SURVIVAL STRATEGY FOR ORNITHOPODS	PALAIOS												The St. Mary River Formation (Maastrichtian) consists of anastomosed fluvial deposits containing several hundred track-bearing beds. Paleontologic and sedimentologic analyses of these beds indicate that large herbivores, ornithopods, inhabited a seasonal wetland dominated by marshes and lakes. Shallow tracks in fine-grained sediments, formed as the sediments dewatered to the point of stiffness, display the highest resolution of detail. The preservation potential of tracks in anastomosed fluvial deposits is large because of the abundance of soft substrates to record the tracks and the occurrence of annual flooding to rapidly bury the footprints. Comparison of the St. Mary River Formation to other anastomosed fluvial deposits as old as the Early Jurassic confirms that tracks are common in this type of deposit. The variation in preservation of track types and depth of penetration raises the possibility that ornithopods employed a survival strategy involving seasonal wetlands. The wetlands provided an abundant food source and at the same time the combination of a soft substrate and flooded conditions would have effectively countered the superior speed and agility of large carnivores. The relatively common occurrence of ornithopod eggshells from anastomosed fluvial deposits suggests that the abundant food supply accompanying the wet season also made the wetlands an ideal location to rear young.																			0883-1351					FEB	1993	8	1					31	44		10.2307/3515220	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3515220													WOS:A1993KR86000004

Land subsidence, diversion of sediment, and salt water intrusion produce stresses associated with waterlogging, elevated salinity, and nutrient depletion, Temporal and spatial environmental variation (sell redox potential, interstitial water salinity, pH, ammonium and phosphorus, and cation and trace metal concentrations) was analyzed near Lake de Cade, Louisiana, in a brackish marsh which is a mosaic of healthy plant communities interspersed with areas where wetland loss is occurring. Environmental variation was related to indicators of stress in Spartina patens, which included variables derived from the adenine nucleotide levels in plants, leaf spectral reflectance, leaf proline concentrations, and shoot elongation. In a comparison of burned and unburned sites, streamside and inland marsh, and along a salinity gradient, among-site differences were found in spectral reflectance and adenine-nucleotide-related indicators. Although it was difficult to relate a single causal environmental variable to the response of a specific indicator, spectral reflectance in the visible light range responded to salinity or to elements borne in seawater; and adenine-nucleotide indices were sensitive to nutrient availability, The ability of indicators to detect plant responses changed during the growing season, suggesting that they were responding to the changing importance of different environmental factors, In addition, some reflectance indicator responses occurred along salinity gradients when salinity differences were less than those that were found to have ecologically meaningful effects in greenhouse experiments. A multivariate numerical approach was used to relate environmental variation with indicator responses. We concluded that factors which in combination cause the degradation and loss of Louisiana wetlands produce environmental conditions that are only subtly different from those in vigorously growing marsh communities.

The two species segregate vertically in stratified lakes; D. galeata mendotae is typically smaller and more epilimnetic than D. pulicaria. The extent of vertical habitat partitioning, however, varies seasonally within and among lakes in apparent response to predation intensity by epilimnetic planktivorous fishes. Daphnia pulicaria uses the epilimnion at low levels of fish predation but is restricted to the hypolimnion under high fish predation, whereas D. galeata mendotae always utilizes the epilimnion. The species display contrasting patterns of genetic variation in neonate size and size at maturity. D. pulicaria is larger in lakes with higher fish and Chaoborus densities whereas D. galeata mendotae is smaller. This contrast in body size in lakes with high predation is associated with greater habitat segregation in those lakes. In lakes with low predation risk, the two species are similar in body size at birth and maturity.																			0029-8549						1991	86	3					342	348		10.1007/BF00317599	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00317599								28312919					WOS:A1991FK48800006

Ontogenetic changes in the drifting of four species of elmid beetles elucidate the complexity of drift-benthos relationships in a small stream in Northwest England	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. This study aimed to quantify ontogenetic changes in the drifting of Elmis aenea, Oulimnius tuberculatus, Esolus parallelepipedus and Limnius volkmari (Coleoptera: Elmidae), and to relate their drift to benthic density. Monthly samples were taken over 39 months, using three surface nets at each of two contrasting sites in a small stream: one in a deep section with abundant macrophytes, and the other in a shallow stony section. 2. Most larvae and adults were taken in the drift at night with little variation between catches in the three nets at each site. Day catches were very low, often zero. No significant relationships could be established between mean numbers in the drift catches and benthic densities. 3. When night catches were converted to drift densities (number caught per 100 m(3) of water sampled), the latter were positively related to monthly losses in the benthos, but not to benthic densities. A linear regression described the relationship, and equations for the different life-stages within each species were not significantly different from the equation for all life-stages combined. However, drift losses were only about 0.07% of total losses in the benthos. A severe spate in October 1967 increased the number of larvae and adults in the drift, but not drift densities, except for immature adults of E. aenea, O. tuberculatus and E. parallelepipedus. 4. Key life-stages with the highest drift density were the earliest life-stage soon after egg hatching for E. aenea, the start of the larval overwintering period for O. tuberculatus and L. volkmari, and mature adults during the mating season for all three species. Drift density for E. parallelepipedus was too low to identify a key life-stage. These key life-stages corresponded with critical periods for survival in the life cycle, as identified in an earlier study in the same stream. Mortality was high during these critical periods, hence the strong relationship between drift density and benthic losses. The latter relationship was very consistent for different life-stages within each species, and partially supported the rarely-tested hypothesis that drift represents surplus production in the benthos.																			0046-5070					JAN	2008	53	1					159	170		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01884.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01884.x													WOS:000251629900013

Length-Weight Relationships and Monthly Variations in Body Weights and Condition Indices of Two Clam's Species; Venerupis aurea and Tapes decussata in Lake Timsah, Egypt	CATRINA-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												Both Venerupis aurea and Tapes decussata are commercially exploited bivalves, and their populations have been severely declining in Lake Timash (Suez Canal, Egypt). Weight-length relationships and monthly changes in body weights and condition in relation to water temperature and gonadal cycle were studied for the two bivalves in this lake. All regressions between body weight and shell length showed higher determination coefficients (R-2). Total weight and shell weight of the two clams increased isometrically with length in most months. Both flesh weight and dry flesh weight indicated negative allometric and isometric relationships to length in most monthly samples of V. aurea and T. decussata, respectively. Body condition was evaluated through three condition indices (CI). Results showed that digestive gland weight of the two species is a good index for body condition. Variations in body weights and the condition indices showed no clear seasonal pattern. Changes in gonad weight and condition indices did not appear to be related to temperature fluctuation. However, temperature correlated negatively with flesh weight of V. aurea (R=-0.617, P<0.05) and T. decussata (R=-0.826 P<0.0005). Although a non-significant correlation was observed between gonad weight and body condition, a clear decline of CI1 and CI2 was found during spawning periods of the two clams. The highest CI3 value of 3.63 in August 2004 for V. aurea and of 3.45 in November 2004 for T. decussata occurred as a prelude to major spawning.

A total of 62 diatom taxa were determined. Cymatopleura solea, Cymbopleura amphicephala, C. minuta, Fragilaria construens, Gomphonema angustum, G. olivaceum, Hannaea arcus, Navicula cryptocephala, N. radiosa, N. rhyncocephala, Nitzschia microcephala, Pinnularia interrupta and Surirella tenera were the most conspicuous diatoms in terms of frequency of occurrence and relative abundance in the epipelic and epiphytic communities. Light and water temperature were found to be a more important factors in the growth of diatoms in this study.

Molecular and statistical analyses were adopted to reveal responses of microbial nutrient limitation and MNC to lakeshore plant removal as well as bacterial adaptability to environmental changes. Activities of sediment enzymes targeting carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles notably decreased after plant removal, and lakeshore plant removal rather than seasonal variation showed larger effects on enzyme activities, ecoenzymatic stoichiometric parameters (i.e., C:N, C:P, and N:P acquisition ratios), and vector analysis parameters (i.e., length and angle). Lakeshore plant removal aggravated sediment microbial phosphorus limitation, and lakeshore plant removal elevated abundances of phosphorus-cycling genes. There was a notable increase in MNC in the water-sediment system after plant removal, and non-nutritional physicochemical factors and phosphorus-cycling genes directly and indirectly affected MNC. There were declined linkages between MNC and taxonomic and phylogenetic alpha-diversities of water and sediment bacteria after plant removal, and non-nutritional physicochemical factors and phosphorus-cycling genes directly and indirectly influenced bacterial diversity. Environmental breadths of bacteria in water and sediment declined after plant removal. Phylogenetic signals of bacteria in water declined after plant removal, but opposite for sediment bacteria. Our results highlighted ecological consequences of lakeshore plant removal regarding microbial nutrient limitation and bacterial diversity maintenance, and findings could guide lake protection and restoration by weakening linkage between bacterial diversity and MNC in water-sediment systems.

J	Acheampong, E; Lafreniere, D; Williams, R; Meadows, G				Acheampong, Esther; Lafreniere, Don; Williams, Ryan; Meadows, Guy			Improving geospatial coastal vulnerability indices for the Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In response to record-high water levels in the Great Lakes, there has been a notable surge in engineering interventions and the construction of armoring structures to mitigate shoreline erosion. However, the efficacy of these defensive measures against erosion and their broader implications for the physical vulnerability of coastal communities remain critical concerns. Our pilot study applied the Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) method to the Muskegon shoreline, enhancing it by calculating CVI values for individual parcels and integrating the shoreline rate of change and shoreline armaments. This approach localized variations and provided a precise understanding of factors influencing vulnerability. We found that using the shoreline rate of change allowed us to identify vulnerable areas prone to erosion due to dynamic shoreline processes and seasonal variations. In the study, seasonality significantly influenced vulnerability, particularly through ice cover, which aligns with findings on seasonal shoreline erosion risks from previous studies. It also underscores the importance of considering temporal dynamics in assessing coastal vulnerability in the Great Lakes region. We observed higher vulnerability in the northern and southern parts of the county's shoreline compared to the central areas. Sites near heavily armored properties exhibited increased vulnerability, highlighting the complex impacts of shoreline armors on adjacent areas. The developed CVI holds the promise of providing coastal managers with invaluable insights. Specifically, it guides the reclassification of high-vulnerability areas and informs the formulation of policies that address the multifaceted challenges associated with shoreline armoring.																			0380-1330					AUG	2025	51	4							102544	10.1016/j.jglr.2025.102544	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2025.102544													WOS:001540922200011

MPs contamination in freshwater ecosystems poses a severe threat to biota. The present study investigated the seasonal and spatial distributions of MPs in significant urban wetlands such as Ukkadam (UD), Selvampathy (SP) and Singanallur (SN) in Coimbatore, Tamilnadu, India. The results indicated that MPs ranged from 10 to 33 particles/L, 6 to 34 particles/L, and 9 to 30 particles/L in the surface water of UD, SP, and SN, respectively. Moreover, the UD, SP, and SN shoreline sediments contained 17 to 45 particles/0.5 kg, 14 to 47 particles/0.5 kg, and 15 to 45 particles/0.5 kg, respectively. The MPs length ranges were between 0.17 and 1.6 mm and 0.16 and 1.1 mm in surface waters and shoreline sediments, respectively. The colour distribution of the MPs in the examined environmental matrices was dominated by blue, transparent, and black, whereas fibres and fragments were the most common shapes of the MPs. The dominant polymers of the MPs were polyethylene terephthalate and polypropylene from the environmental matrices of the studied wetlands. Among the seasons, the monsoon season influences the abundance of MPs in both water and sediments of the UD, SP, and SN wetlands. Spatial influences from each lake reveal the transfer of MPs from urban environments. The present findings reveal the seasonal and spatial influences on the abundance, shape, colour and polymer nature of MPs in Coimbatore's wetlands, reflecting the risk of MPs pollution.

Rhizoclonium-like macroalgae blooms have been reported in estuaries, but their occurrence on tropical reefs remains unexplored. This study, conducted between 2005 and 2018, documents the seasonal occurrence of Rhizoclonium-like blooms on reefs and identifies key environmental drivers. These blooms, first recorded in 2006 and becoming more frequent by 2010, occur annually between May and August. The algae form carpets near the substrate, interacting with organisms like reef-building corals, octocorals, ascidians, and sponges. Statistical analysis links the blooms to increased atmospheric pressure and a wider temperature range. The blooms are not influenced by upwelling or land-based nutrients, suggesting meteorological and temperature factors as key drivers. This is the first documented occurrence of large Rhizoclonium-like blooms on tropical reefs, highlighting the need for further study amid global environmental change.

However, few studies report GHG emissions from village ponds, which brings uncertainty in estimating GHG emission budgets. Here, we seasonally measured CO2 and CH4 concentrations and estimated their diffusive emissions from fourteen village ponds, either phytoplankton-dominated (PDPs) or free-floating plant-dominated (FDPs), across the North China Plain. The village ponds exhibited high (mean f SD) concentrations and diffusive fluxes of CO2 (9.20 f 0.56 mg-CO2 L-1 and 186 f 367 mg-CO2 m-2 h-1) and CH4 (1.63 f 4.21 mg-CH4 L-1 and 33.7 f 82.1 mg-CH4 m-2 h-1), with FDPs (475 f 492 mg-CO2 m-2 h-1 and 87.6 f 120 mg-CH4 m-2 h-1) tremendously exceeding PDPs (20.74 f 54.60 mg-CO2 m-2 h-1 and 2.92 f 2.49 mg-CH4 m-2 h-1). Cumulatively, village ponds in the North China Plain were estimated to emit diffusive 10.39 (0.92-26.54) Tg CO2-eq yr-1, equaling 8.54 % of the total CO2 and CH4 emissions from lakes and reservoirs in China, although their area is only 0.88 % of the latter. Therefore, village ponds are hotspots of GHG emissions and should be incorporated in regional and national GHG budgets.

Here, we monitored seasonal changes in sediment and porewater chemical parameters, and applied high-throughput sequencing and co-occurrence network analysis to compare SRB and SOB communities in surface sediments from cyanobacteria-dominated (ZSB) and macrophyte-dominated (XKB) habitats of Lake Taihu across four seasons. In ZSB, seasonal variations in acid volatile sulfide (AVS), dissolved sulfide (& sum;H2S), and Fe(II) were the primary drivers of sulfur bacterial communities. In contrast, SRB in XKB were mainly influenced by total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP), while SOB were regulated by spatial heterogeneity, with AVS as the key driver. Spore-forming SRB such as Desulfotomaculum were distinctly enriched in ZSB, indicating an adaptive strategy to environmental fluctuations. Notably, Cupriavidus, a genus rarely linked to sulfur oxidation, was the dominant SOB genus in both habitats. Co-occurrence network analysis showed that dominant genera in ZSB acted as network hubs, indicating greater vulnerability to environmental changes in cyanobacteria-dominated habitats. Conversely, XKB displayed evenly distributed interaction networks without dominant network hubs, enhancing resilience to environmental fluctuations. These findings provide new insight into how macrophyte-dominated habitats enhance the resilience of shallow freshwater lakes to algal bloom expansion via stabilized sulfur cycling. Hydrological and hydrodynamic factors should be considered in future to better elucidate sulfur cycling in freshwater lakes.					zhao, liya/OHT-7589-2025														0013-9351	1096-0953				AUG 1	2025	278								121685	10.1016/j.envres.2025.121685	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2025.121685								40294838					WOS:001493887300001

However, harvest strategies to mitigate this issue remain unclear. This study aims to evaluate the effects of harvest intensity and frequency on P. crispus growth and water purification performance. Results showed that plant harvest promoted biomass accumulation. With the most significant plant height observed under low-intensity (25 %) and low-frequency (1 time) plant harvest enhanced complete or partial recovery. This plant harvest mode also enhanced pollutant removal, achieving COD, NH4+-N, TN, and TP removal of 54.70 %, 69.60 %, 47.20 %, and 67.30 %, respectively. In contrast, medium-high intensity (50 % and 75 %) and frequency (2 and 4 times) of plant harvest reduced water purification efficiency. Pearson correlation analysis indicated a strong link between P. crispus growth and water purification. Therefore, plant harvest 1-2 times with low harvest intensity of 25 % was recommended to enhance plant recovery and pollutant removal.

J	Fisher, AS; Podniesinski, GS; Leopold, DJ				Fisher, AS; Podniesinski, GS; Leopold, DJ			Effects of drainage ditches on vegetation patterns in abandoned agricultural peatlands in central New York	WETLANDS												Drainage ditches and ground-water gradients in abandoned agricultural sapric peatlands (mucklands) produce distinctive vegetation patterns. Ditches in abandoned mucklands were ineffective in creating ground-water depression in adjacent soil, while ditches in a newly-cleared muckland were effective in doing so. Upon abandonment, drainage ditches are subject to bank erosion and sedimentation. Coupled with years of soil subsidence and an altered hydrologic regime, ditches lose effectiveness in draining and function merely as small-scale topographic depressions, providing linear zones of seasonally high water levels. Species are distributed on abandoned mucklands in association with soil moisture conditions induced by topographic variation at both small (i.e., ditches) and larger (i.e., site-wide) spatial scales. Vegetation that is usually restricted to moist or saturated soils had greater cover closer to or within drainage ditches or in other topographically low areas, while species with low fidelity to saturated soil dominated the remaining drier areas. Some shrub species had slightly greater stem densities either within or immediately adjacent to ditches, resulting in a ''parallel'' distribution (i.e., illustrating ditch-fidelity). Species having higher affinity to lower soil moisture conditions, such as quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), showed significantly greater stem density in areas farther away from ditches. Ground-water levels are of primary importance in affecting distribution patterns on naturally revegetating, abandoned agricultural mucklands. The accuracy of the wetland indicator status for woody and herbaceous species encountered on these abandoned mucklands is supported quantitatively by direct gradient analysis. The functioning of existing drainage ditch systems should be assessed prior to any mitigation or restoration activities.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				DEC	1996	16	4					397	409		10.1007/BF03161329	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03161329													WOS:A1996WB27900001

We conducted the first complete ice season monitoring of Lake Ulansu (Ulansuhai, Wuliangsuhai), revealing unique thermal behavior. The lake was salinity stratified (<3 parts per thousand), stabilizing the lower water layer and allowing the water temperature to reach 10 degrees C before break-up. The solar radiation absorbed by the water (Q(sw)) drove the water-ice heat flux, with approximately 82% of Q(sw) returning to the ice base, facilitating a rapid shift from convective mixing to stable stratification.

J	Ayele, F				Ayele, Fantahun			Malaria Epidemics in Dembia, Northwest Ethiopia 1952-1953	ETHIOPIAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH DEVELOPMENT												Background: Malaria has been one of the deadliest killer diseases in Ethiopia. About 68 percent of the Ethiopian people are living in malaria prone areas. Most of these areas have been experiencing seasonal malaria epidemics. In 1952/53, Dembia district bordering Lake Tana in the north had experienced devastating malaria epidemics. Objective: The main objective of this study is to investigate the history of the 1952/53 malaria epidemic in Dembia and the scale of its devastation. Methods: The study uses a large number of untapped archival documents kept in Gondarto find out the extent of the epidemic that claimed the lives of thousands of people. Results: Thousands of people lost their lives in Dembia. Survivors were too weak to bury the dead. Corpses were left unburied and they were devoured by wild animals. Qolla Debba, the capital of Dembia district and the epicenter of the epidemic became a ghost town deserted by its residents. The countryside was equally devastated by the epidemic. Agricultural activities came to a standstill. Since the epidemic coincided with planting and harvesting seasons, it brought about incalculable damage on agricultural production. Conclusion: For the people of Dembia, the 1952/53 malaria outbreak was the most dreadful and disastrous epidemic in living memory. It caused innumerable human and material damage. Although the epidemic affected all age groups, its impact on the productive section of the population was felt strongly. Local officials dutifully reported mortality figures emphasizing on the severity of the epidemic. But the response from higher bodies was not satisfactory. Apart from sending small teams and limited anti-malarial drugs, the imperial government failed to mobilize human and material resources to effectively deal with the epidemic and save lives. It was only in the wake of that disaster that the government managed to build a health center at Qolla Debba partly through public contribution.																			1021-6790						2017	31	1					57	63																WOS:000408464300008

The surface water level is measured within a terrestrial reference frame with a repeatability varying from 10 to 35 days depending on the orbit cycle of the satellite. With several decades of technique refinement; current data processing can be fairly simple or complex depending on the mission and the tracking methods. Data acquisition is not affected by weather conditions; but the technique can have a number of limitations. However; the technique is sufficiently advanced to have allowed a number of inland water case studies. Focusing on the large lakes; the links between lake evolution and the local climate cycle on seasonal to interannual timescales can be explored; and water storage balance for water management also can be brought into focus. This article reviews present day lake level monitoring and the case study of the Lebsko lake in Poland. First the basic principle of satellite altimetry, current altimetry missions, hydrology application and lake and reservoir altimetry measurements in web sites are shortly describe. Next the investigation of the surface of the Lebsko lake in Poland was carried out. From our study reveals that altimetry could provide a promising future for true global lake studies with height and width observation of all targets with centimeter accuracy.

In order to assess sediment quality of the lake buffer zone of Zhushan Bay, Taihu Lake, macrofauna and sediment chemicals were analyzed at 33 sites from August 2013 to May 2014. A total of 79 macrofaunal species were identified, belonging to 3 phyla, 14 orders and 20 families. The most two dominant taxa were Oligochaeta (78%) and Chironomidae larva (19%). In terms of species richness, Chironomidae larva were the largest group (43 species), followed by Oligochaeta, Mollusca, Hirudinea, Decapoda and Polychaeta. Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri (accounting for 26.2%) was the most dominant species, which was one of the heavy pollution indicators in the study area. According to Biotic Index (BI), sediment quality was under serious pollution during August 2013 to March 2014, ranging from 7.98 to 8.81 while there was a declining trend for BI from March 2014 to May 2014, which indicated that sediment quality was under recovery. However, chemical indices showed that a continuous amelioration of sediment quality from December 2013 to March 2014, which was not consistent with biological assessment. This result indicated that there was a delay of the recovery for macrofauna compared with sediment chemicals. Correlation analysis showed that BI had significant relationship with sediment total nitrogen. The present study showed that in sediment quality assessment, macrofauna should be involved, which could provide more accurate results than sediment chemicals.					li, mengyang/JWO-9551-2024; Liu, Xiaoshou/I-3001-2019														1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	3					2410	2421																WOS:000399966600067

The methods of data mining and clustering analysis were used to explore the activity characteristics of tourists with different attributes in scenic spot and the activity differences of different age tourists in different scenic spots affected by season, not only considered gender, geographical, check-in time and other factors, but also the introduced age attributes. At the same time, the scenic area is divided into "Adolescent active pattern","Young and middle-aged women active pattern","Middle-aged and old men active pattern" and "General active pattern" according to different tourists' activities law of different gender and age in spatial perspective. Research shows that female tourists are mainly distributed in the Green Lake Park, Nanping Street, Dounan Flower Market and other attractions, elderly male tourists are mainly distributed in Expo Park, Jindian area. Foreign tourists accounted for 86.32% of the total tourists, reflecting the rapid development of tourism in Kunming. The spatial distribution of tourist attractions has an impact on the distribution of tourists' attributes. The number of tourists of Shilin, Jiuxiang, Guandu Ancient Town are accounted for 36.38% of the total tourists, which shows that the spatial distribution of tourist attributes is consistent with the development of key tourist areas in Kunming.

As the urbanization and population increasing, three types of surface water are simultaneously applied for drinking water sources in Huzhou. Based on the continuous monitoring and data analysis from 2011 to 2015, water quality evaluation was carried out by nine water quality indexes, in order to investigate the pollution characteristics and temporal variation trends of drinking water sources. The results showed that these three types of surface water generally conformed to the water quality standards of drinking water sources, and the water quality decreased in order of reservoir, lake and river. The water quality of reservoir was good and stable, while the main problem of Tai Lake was the exceeding standards of total nitrogen and total phosphorus which might lead to the algae growth. In the rivers, the indexes exceeding the national standards were total nitrogen, iron and manganese, and water quality indexes including chemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, ammonia nitrogen and total nitrogen exhibited seasonal variation. More attention should be paid to water eutrophication and seasonal accidental risk in Huzhou.

A large-scale debris flow, occurred on June 23, 2012 at Haitong Watershed, blocked the Xiqu River and formed a dammed lake with the average width of 60 m, the length of 300 m and the reservoir volume of 90,000-100,000 m(3). The traffic of G318 Highway was interrupted until June 30th as the result that the highway base was buried about 230 m by debris flow deposits and inundated over 160 m by dammed lake. The investigation and the analysis of debris flow deposit samples showed that the debris flow delivered about 100,000 m(3) sediment out of watershed, deposited along Xiqu River and formed a dam with the length of 230 m, the width of 100 m and the average thickness of 7-8 m. The clay content and density of debris flow deposits was 0.41-0.86% and 1.89-2.01 t/m(3), respectively. Using the parameters of cross sections obtained by field measuring, the velocities and peak discharge for debris flow were estimated, and the velocities of flow reached 10.9-12.1 m/s by virtue of steep channel as well as the peak discharge at the mouth, the right gully and the left gully was 924, 642 and 336 m(3)/s, respectively. The debris flow on June 23 formed a hazard chain which was composed of flash flood, debris flow, dammed lake and outburst flood, and the threshold of debris flow blocking river was that the discharge, the magnitude and the deposits at river channel of debris flow was 230-850 m(3)/s, 11,709 and 9233 m(3). The active tectonic movement, abundant erosion deposits and steep geomorphology are responsible for debris flow formation, the rainstorm after long-period drought triggered debris flows and the sediments induced by channel deposits initiation at the lower of the watershed further supplied and enlarged debris flow. The highway risk were assessed using the model which was established based on dynamic mechanism, and the high-dangerous zone and middle-dangerous zone occupied 86.5%, which agreed with the actual, where were buried by debris flow deposits or submerged by the following dammed lake. Based on the hazards and risk of debris flows on June 23, the protection measures, including dangerous debris flow identification, risk assessment, rational route, integrated control and emergency plans, were recommended.																					978-3-319-53485-5; 978-3-319-53484-8				2017							581	592		10.1007/978-3-319-53485-5_67	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-53485-5_67													WOS:000438668800067

Influence of Movement Dynamics on Walleye Harvest Management in Intermixed Fisheries in a Chain of Lakes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Fish populations that exhibit movement patterns present challenges to fishery management. In the Inland Waterway in Michigan's northern Lower Peninsula, monitoring Walleye Sander vitreus population dynamics and harvest management is difficult because of seasonal intermixing among interconnected lakes. In addition, the presence of tribal subsistence fishing and recreational angling fisheries that occur during different discrete time periods adds complexity to understanding harvest management performance. We used stochastic simulation to determine the influence of movement and harvest dynamics on the performance of harvest management targets for Walleye in our study system. After accounting for postspawn movement and harvest dynamics, our results indicated that population-specific exploitation rates on average did not exceed the target rates (u = 0.35) that are mandated in the waterway. We did, however, determine that some areas are at risk because they experienced population-specific exploitation rates that surpassed the target. We also determined that the interplay between movement and uncertain population and harvest dynamics will likely determine the ability of management to meet currently accepted harvest targets on average over time, as well as the risk of exceeding harvest targets each year. Our findings are broadly applicable for mobile species inhabiting lake chains and highlight that it is critical for managers to gain an understanding of movement as well as harvest dynamics, because both are imperative for understanding how these dynamics influence harvest management performance. As such, we recommend that managers of Walleye populations in other waterways implement tagging studies and harvest monitoring programs to gain an understanding of movement rates and harvest dynamics. An understanding of movement and harvest dynamics along with the stochastic simulation framework we used provides a better understanding of complex system dynamics and leads to informed harvest management decisions.																			0275-5947	1548-8675					2017	37	3					467	479		10.1080/02755947.2017.1280569	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2017.1280569													WOS:000402630900001

Fish Biology and Life History Indicators	LAKE VICTORIA FISHERIES RESOURCES: RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT IN TANZANIA	Monographiae Biologicae											Life history traits like growth, reproduction, food and mortality are principal factors in the survival of the fish. This chapter examines the life history indicators of three commercial fish species in Lake Victoria, namely Nile perch (Lates niloticus), Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and the cyprinid known as 'Dagaa' (Rastrineobola argentea). The size at first maturity for Nile perch has been declining due to stress in the population caused by heavy exploitation, changes in food availability and deteriorating water quality parameters, particularly dissolved oxygen concentration. The fish exhibits ontogenic shifts in food. R. argentea has an offshore surface dwelling behaviour with about 68% found distributed in waters of more than 40 m depth. Its size at first maturity varies from place to place. R. argentea breeds throughout the year but with distinct peaks during the rainy season. An increase in fecundity has been observed in Nile tilapia and it is considered a mechanism to compensate for the intensive fishing pressure in the lake. Studies indicate an increase in size and growth parameters for Nile tilapia despite the heavy fishing pressure as a result of increased demand in local and foreign markets. The success of the species could be due to the ability of the species to expand their niche. It has diversified its food to include Caridina nilotica, chironomids, chaoborids, molluscs and bottom detrital matter. An ecosystem approach guided by a precautionary principle is required in order to manage the fishery resources in Lake Victoria and to ensure their sustainability.

Hydrology of Lake Tana Basin	SOCIAL AND ECOLOGICAL SYSTEM DYNAMICS: CHARACTERISTICS, TRENDS, AND INTEGRATION IN THE LAKE TANA BASIN, ETHIOPIA	AESS Interdisciplinary Environmental Studies and Sciences Series											Lake Tana Basin located in the northeast Ethiopia is one of the tributaries of the Blue Nile. The rainfall over the Upper Blue Nile in general, originates from moist air coming from the Atlantic and Indian oceans following the north-south movement of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone. The area has one main rainy season between June and September, receiving about 70-90% of the annual rainfall. The southern portion of the Tana basin receives the highest rainfall (similar to 1600 mm) with a decreasing trend from south to north (similar to 1200 mm). The dry season occurs between November and April while the wet season occurs mostly between May and October. The basin has four main rivers: the Gilgel Abay, Gumara, Rib and Megech. The Gilgel Abay River alone contributes 60% of the flow into Lake Tana. Lake Tana is the largest lake in the country but is relatively shallow; historically, lake levels have fluctuated within the range of 1784.26-1787.81 m.a.s.l. The hydrological process of the basin is poorly understood and only 42% of the basin is gauged. Recently, efforts have been made to identify the processes by different scientists.

The article analyzes the influence of natural and regulated stream stretches on water quality and stream self-purification effectiveness. The analysis of nitrate concentration in water samples taken from natural and regulated stream stretches was conducted for the identification of water quality. Nitrate (NO3) concentrations and their alternation during different seasons were studied. The conducted analysis revealed that stream nitrate self-purification is better in natural stream stretches. An average coefficient of self-purification recorded in the course of the research in natural stretches was 0.57, whereas in a regulated stretch - 0.09. On purpose to improve surface-water quality and self-purification effectiveness it is suggested to naturalize regulated stream stretches, to allow woody vegetation grow on slopes, to encourage meandering, pools and shoals forming processes in floodplains.																			2029-7106		978-609-476-044-0				2017									UNSP enviro.2017.090	10.3846/enviro.2017.090	http://dx.doi.org/10.3846/enviro.2017.090													WOS:000495878500247

Small details of big importance: Carbon mass determination in the invasive cladoceran Cercopagis pengoi (Ostroumov, 1891) by the high temperature combustion method	NEOBIOTA												Carbon mass of the non-indigenous predatory fishhook water flea Cercopagis pengoi (Ostroumov, 1891) from the eastern Gulf of Finland, the Baltic Sea, was for the first time measured using the high temperature combustion method. Prior to the analysis, individual dry weight of Cercopagis was determined; altogether ca. 500 organisms were examined. Mean individual dry weight of C. pengoi for July-September was estimated as 34.0 mu g; carbon mass averaged 15.8 mu g; carbon content, calculated as percent of dry weight, averaged 43.4%. Those values varied over months, mainly because of different population structure of C. pengoi and variation in their diet due to seasonal dynamics of the food objects. However, relations between carbon mass and dry weight for different months did not differ statistically (p< 0.001). Therefore, the general polynomial regressions (k= 2), describing carbon mass-to-dry weight and carbon content-to-dry weight relationships, were calculated for the entire dataset of individual measurements of C. pengoi body metrics. These data will contribute to adequate evaluation of food web structure and ecosystem alterations in various water bodies invaded by C. pengoi which has got a strong potential to pelagic food web transformations that may impact the overall energy balance and decrease the size of fish stocks.					; Telesh, Irena/N-4342-2016	Telesh, Irena/0000-0002-4167-3821; 													1619-0033	1314-2488					2017		33					19	32		10.3897/neobiota.33.9823	http://dx.doi.org/10.3897/neobiota.33.9823													WOS:000396312100002

Characteristics of the snow cover distribution on the coast of Lake Baikal	LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW												The paper presents results of studies of the dynamics of snow cover characteristics along the Lake Baikal coast for the years 1961-2009. Statistical characteristics of the following elements: snow depth, duration of the period with snow cover, dates of onset and destruction of snow cover, were calculated from data of local meteorological stations. Mean annual snow depth in the region varies from 1 to 36 cm, while the maximal ten-day values changes from 12 cm on the West coast up to 60-86 cm on the East coast. Mean duration of the snow cover in the Baikal region is 138 days, while on the East coast it lasts for 178 days, and on the West one - for 126 days. Long-term trends of the snow cover characteristics are mostly statistically insignificant. However, at the end of the above period dates of the snow cover onset and destruction has been shifted to earlier dates. The inter-annual variability of these dates reaches 30 days. A linear dependence of the snow cover depth on the mean air temperature and the precipitation amount for the cold season was revealed with correlation coefficients from 0.31 to 0.89.					; Voropay, Nadezhda/A-6673-2014	Voropay, Nadezhda/0000-0003-4179-4225; 													2076-6734	2412-3765					2017	57	3					355	364		10.15356/2076-6734-2017-3-355-364	http://dx.doi.org/10.15356/2076-6734-2017-3-355-364													WOS:000418522200007

Long-Term and Seasonal Trends of Wastewater Chemicals in Lake Mead: An Introduction to Time Series Decomposition	JOURNAL OF STATISTICS EDUCATION												A recent paper published time series of concentrations of chemicals in drinking water collected from the bottom of Lake Mead, a major American water supply reservoir. Data were compared to water level using only linear regression. This creates an opportunity for students to analyze these data further. This article presents a structured introduction to time series decomposition that compares long-term and seasonal components of a time series of a single chemical (meprobamate) with those of two supporting datasets (reservoir volume and specific conductance). For the chemical data, this must be preceded by estimation of missing datum points. Results show that linear regression analyses of time series data obscure meaningful detail and that specific conductance is the important predictor of seasonal chemical variations. To learn this, students must execute a linear regression, estimate missing data using local regression, decompose time series, and compare time series using cross-correlation. Complete R code for these exercises appears in the supplementary information. This article uses real data and requires that students make and justify key decisions about the analysis. It can be a guided or an individual project. It is scalable to instructor needs and student interests in ways that are identified clearly in this article.																			1069-1898						2017	25	1					38	49		10.1080/10691898.2017.1286960	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10691898.2017.1286960													WOS:000424625200006

A total of 85 phytoplankton species, consisting of 15 blue greens, 37 diatoms, 28 greens, and 5 other minor groups are recorded. The phytoplankton biomass showed a certain decline when turbidity increased during the rainy season. Microcystis sp. was found to dominate the phytoplankton community of Lake Tana throughout the rainy and post-rainy seasons. The chlorophyll a concentration in the water column of the lake varied between 0.03 and 13.44 mu g L-1 and showed marked seasonal variations. The highest chlorophyll concentrations were observed in the post-rainy season. The average gross primary production in Lake Tana (mean: 1.8 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1)) is relatively lower compared to African lakes. A number of studies on zooplankton in Lake Tana recorded a total of 26 zooplankton species, consisting of 3 copepods, 11 cladocerans and 12 rotifers. Copepods showed usually higher densities than cladocerans and rotifers. In the case of Lake Tana, the major factors responsible for temporal and spatial change of the plankton are resource limitations and a high sediment concentration. During the productive season (PORS), the phytoplankton is dominated by large species (e.g. Melosira and Microcystis spp.), which are difficult to be consumed by the herbivorous zooplankton.																			2509-9787	2509-9795	978-3-319-45755-0; 978-3-319-45753-6				2017							143	156		10.1007/978-3-319-45755-0_11	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-45755-0_11	10.1007/978-3-319-45755-0												WOS:000419723900012

In this study, we integrate data from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) to jointly estimate TWS variations in the TP and examine their spatiotemporal fluctuations in relation to large-scale climate patterns. To evaluate our approach, we conducted two synthetic tests, which showed that the root mean square errors (RMSEs) for the joint inversion were 23-37% lower than those for GNSS inversion, confirming the effectiveness of our method. When applied to real observational data, the joint inversion technique revealed that the spatial patterns and seasonal characteristics of TWS changes closely aligned with independent GRACE and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) products, while offering more detailed insights into local hydrological processes. Notably, during the 2015/2016 El Nino event, the central and eastern TP experienced severe drought, primarily driven by precipitation anomalies (similar to -150 mm) associated with extreme climate events, leading to a delayed hydrological response to the meteorological drought. Furthermore, we observed significant interannual variability across the TP sub-basins, with a moderate correlation with the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) at a one-month lag. Our research highlights the potential of joint inversion using GNSS and GRACE to enhance TWS monitoring in the TP, providing more spatially detailed insights into water storage variability in response to climate change.					lv, yifei/KVB-8419-2024														2045-2322					JUL 25	2025	15	1							27168	10.1038/s41598-025-12635-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-12635-x								40715426					WOS:001537442500018

A new mass-balance model was developed to predict phosphorus fluxes to, within and from lakes and lake concentrations of phosphorus. 2. The model is driven by data easily accessed from standard monitoring programmes or maps, so it should be useful in many contexts of lake management. 3. The phosphorus model gives seasonal (weekly) variations and accounts for all fundamental abiotic/biotic interactions and feedbacks for lakes in general for phosphorus. The model has been developed within the framework of a more comprehensive ecosystem model, LakeWeb, which accounts for production values and biomasses of nine functional groups of organisms (phytoplankton, bacterioplankton, herbivorous and predatory zooplankton, prey and predatory fish, zoobenthos, macrophytes and benthic algae). 4. The LakeWeb-model has been critically tested in a wide limnological domain and shown to predict very well. By using this model, it is possible for the first time to predict realistic values of biouptake and retention of phosphorous in biota in lakes on a weekly basis.

Long-term lake water levels in central Chile using satellite altimetry and conceptual hydrological modelling approaches	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH												Lakes play a vital role in biodiversity conservation and water regulation but are increasingly affected by climate change and human activity. Despite their importance, long-term water level (WL) records remain scarce for most lakes in the Southern Hemisphere. This study introduces a novel conceptual modeling framework for reconstructing WL dynamics, applied to Lake Lanalhue in south-central Chile over the period 1950-2022. The approach integrates satellite altimetry (Sentinel-3A), validated against in-situ WL data, with global hydroclimatic datasets (ERA5-Land, GLEV, TerraClimate). Validation against altimetric records (2016-2023) shows strong agreement (R2 = 0.71; NRMSE = 0.11 m). Precipitation emerges as the dominant seasonal driver (R2 = 0.86), while evaporation exerting a lagged secondary influence (R2 = 0.67). Climate oscillations modulate variability across distinct temporal scales: ENSO drives high-frequency interannual fluctuations (R = 0.37), while the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) governs lower-frequency variability (>= 5 years; R = 0.60-0.64). A long-term WL decline of similar to 5 cm per year is attributed to reduced precipitation and regional warming, amplified by AAO-related circulation changes.

In Lake Michigan, the mean length, mass, and Lipid levels of individual Diporeia from 45 m were significantly different from those collected from 100 m in 1988, in 1989, only mass and Lipid levels were significantly different between depths. In contrast, regardless of the year, the Lake Ontario Diporeia from 35 m were similar in mass and length to those from 125 m, but lipid levels were significantly different between depths. Combined means for total lipid for each lake over similar months revealed higher levels in Lake Ontario than in Lake Michigan Diporeia. Triacylglycerols were the dominant Lipid class in all the amphipods, with mean levels reaching a maximum of 84% of the total lipid in individuals from Lake Ontario at 35 m. Trophic state, food-web, and (or) genetic differences are probably responsible for the occurrence of higher lipid levels in Lake Ontario Diporeia than in Lake Michigan Diporeia.																			0706-652X					SEP	1996	53	9					2044	2051		10.1139/cjfas-53-9-2044	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-53-9-2044													WOS:A1996WE25900012

(Onagraceae), a perennial medicinal plant, has considerable pharmaceutical value due to its phenolic acids, flavonoids, and ellagitannins, including oenothein A and B. The plant is reported to have therapeutic benefits for several conditions, such as prostate gland, bladder, and hormonal disorders. This study aimed to provide evidence-based data on the chemical composition of the species over a 1-year cycle and define the optimal harvesting period, which is essential to ensure consistency and efficacy in plant-derived products.Methods The phytochemical variability of E. hirsutum across habitats (mesic grassland, wet grassland, and lake shore), plant parts (leaves and stems), and phenological stages (from April to October) was investigated. Using HPLC and HPTLC methods, 11 pharmacologically active marker compounds were quantified in 78 samples collected every 2 weeks during 2023.Results Among the hydroxycinnamic acids, chlorogenic acid was dominant in samples from shaded habitats, with maximum accumulation in samples from leaves during the vegetative phase (up to 2.25 mg/g DW). Flavonoids such as isoquercitrin and hyperoside peaked in leaves from the lake shore and wet grassland habitats during flowering. Oenothein B, a major ellagitannin, showed the highest concentrations in wet grassland leaves during flowering (73.97 mg/g DW).Conclusion This study is the first to integrate habitat, phenology, and plant part data to characterise seasonal dynamics of key marker compounds in E. hirsutum under natural east-part of the United Kingdom conditions. Shaded, moist habitats were found to promote higher biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, whereas open, dry conditions favoured biomass yield. Distinct seasonal patterns in the accumulation of beta-hydroxycinnamic acids and ellagitannins provide insight into their physiological functions and potential pharmacological significance. By identifying the dynamics of marker compounds and optimal harvesting periods, the study provides a framework for sustainable industrial practices for pharmaceutical raw material production and supports standardisation in herbal production.

All of these planktonic organisms are components of a microbial loop and are countable using an epifluorescence microscope. These data represent the results of monthly collections from April 1996 through March 2010 at two sites on the lake, and this data set is unique among the available published data papers concerning lakes or plankton and continues to be freely available. The monitoring was performed as a component of the Lake Kasumigaura Long-term Environmental Monitoring program conducted by National Institute for Environmental Studies since 1977 and includes water quality, plankton, and benthos. The data have been used for ecological studies and for studies on the management of water quality.																			0912-3814					SEP	2012	27	5					839	839		10.1007/s11284-012-0972-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-012-0972-2													WOS:000308951600002
J	Simcic, T; Brancelj, A				Simcic, Tatjana; Brancelj, Anton			Ecosystem health index (EHI) and electron transport system (ETS) activity of plankton and sediment in two lakes differing in trophic status	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Ecosystem health index (EHI) and respiratory electron transport system (ETS) activity were measured in plankton and sediment communities from two Slovenian lakes differing in their trophic status. The EHIs for Lake Bled and Lake Bohinj corresponded to a health status "Middle" and "Good", respectively. The negative correlations that were found between EHI on the one hand and ETS activities of zooplankton and sediment and total ETS activity on the other indicated a higher ETS activity of zooplankton, sediment and total ETS activity at higher trophic status. The low seasonal variation of respiratory potential in the sediment, and its importance in degradation of organic matter and recycling of nutrients in the lakes, makes the measurement of the biological oxidation capacity of sediment appropriate for monitoring changes in ecosystem functioning in comparison to plankton communities. Thus, sediment ETS activity is a valuable source of information on the lake ecosystem, its functioning and its health, in combination with other indicators or information about the system. However, the interpretation of measured ETS activities of sediments needs knowledge on the specific characteristics of the lakes under investigation.

Pleomorphism in the Antarctic flagellate Pyramimonas gelidicola (Prasinophyceae, Chlorophyta)	POLAR RESEARCH												Species of the genus Pyramimonas (Prasinophyceae) are a common, widespread, but minor component of the Antarctic marine phytoplankton. They are often associated with the seasonal sea-ice environment. Pyramimonas gelidicola (McFadden, Moestrup & Wetherbee, 1982) was isolated from the water column of a saline Antarctic lake, and observations on the organism's life history as it grew in unialgal cultures were made. The alga proved to be pleomorphic: capable of producing several morphologically distinct life stages. We recorded motile single-celled quadriflagellates that formed two statistically distinct size classes, a rare uniflagellate cell-type, and aggregations of quadriflagellate cells, multilobed forms and an encystment stage. Multilobed forms and cell aggregations, never before observed in an Antarctic Pyramimonas species, are presumed to be growth medium-induced morphotypes. Multilobed forms contained an equal number of nuclei and lobes, suggesting that they are the product of asexual reproduction. Some of the morphotypes we report here may never be observed under natural field conditions, but the potential for this alga to alternate between morphotypes is clearly demonstrated.																			0800-0395					DEC	2009	28	3					426	432		10.1111/j.1751-8369.2009.00123.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-8369.2009.00123.x													WOS:000272163900011

A multi-species dry season game count carried out in Rukwa Game Reserve (RGR) in 2004 estimated a population size of 1729, but was associated with a high margin of error [coefficient of variation (CV) 0.88]. To increase the precision for the local puku population estimate, we conducted a zig-zag line transect survey restricted only to areas occupied by puku in the dry season of 2006. This survey technique produced an estimate of 776 individuals and the CV was considerably reduced to 0.29. Puku herd size was comparable with the studies carried out in the Kilombero valley, Tanzania and in Kasanka National Park, Zambia, thus broadly confirming the herding ecology of this species. We found that pukus were restricted to the central parts of the floodplains, suggesting an avoidance of habitats used by pastoralists at the edge of RGR. Compared with the estimates of the puku population made in the 1980s, the puku population has declined. We recommend regular monitoring and enforcement of the current management plan to conserve the local puku population.

Walleye discrete epidermal hyperplasia, the focus of this report, is a seasonally limited skin disease caused by two closely related retroviruses, walleye epidermal hyperplasia virus type 1 and type 2. As with walleye dermal sarcoma, the in-lake transmission patterns of this disease are unknown. The percent of fish developing walleye epidermal hyperplasia lesions increased incrementally with age in this study. It is unlikely that all walleyes of a given year-class will contract discrete epidermal hyperplasia in their lifetimes because fewer than 20% of the fish age 8 and older were affected. In contrast, the prevalence of walleye dermal sarcoma, a disease we believe eventually affects almost all exposed walleyes, changes with age, decreasing after age 6, which suggests that walleyes develop resistance to that disease.

J	Guitton, A; Claerbout, J				Guitton, A; Claerbout, J			Interpolation of bathymetry data from the Sea of Galilee: A noise attenuation problem	GEOPHYSICS												We process a bathymetry survey from the Sea of Galilee. Ibis data set is contaminated with non-Gaussian noise in the form of spikes inside the lake and at the track ends. There is drift on the depth measurements leading to vessel tracks in the preliminary depth images. ne drift comes from different seasonal and human conditions during data acquisition, e.g., wind and water levels. We derive an inversion scheme that produces a much-reduced noise map of the Sea of Galilee. This in-version scheme includes preconditioning and iteratively reweighted least squares with the proper weighting function to remove the non-Gaussian noise. We remove the ship tracks by adding a modeling operator inside the inversion that accounts for the drift in the data. We then approximate the model covariance matrix with a prediction error filter that enhances details inside the lake. Unfortunately, the prediction error filter slightly degrades the frequency content of the final depth map. Our images of the Sea of Galilee show ancient shorelines and, inside the lake, rifting features.

However, the contribution proportions of anthropogenic activities and climate change to the lakes and rivers' eutrophication in large basins has not been clearly revealed. This study employed Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to conduct a dual quantification of the differential contributions of anthropogenic activities and climate change to the eutrophication of rivers and lakes in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB). Regression coefficients of GWR variables demonstrated the spatial heterogeneity of eutrophication drivers. Shapley additive explanations showed that nutrients and land use intensity were the main drivers during wet seasons. Combining the direct and indirect path results from SEM, the relative contribution of anthropogenic activities and climate change was 92.1 % and 7.9 % to river eutrophication, respectively, and was 67.1 % and 32.9 % to lake eutrophication, respectively. Anthropogenic activities consistently exacerbate eutrophication in both rivers and lakes, whereas climate change intensifies lake eutrophication but exerts seasonally variable effects on rivers. These findings revealed that intensive anthropogenic activities continue to dominate the eutrophication of the YRB. This study can provide a scientific reference for the inte-grated management of aquatic ecosystems in large basins.

J	CRONK, JK; MITSCH, WJ				CRONK, JK; MITSCH, WJ			PERIPHYTON PRODUCTIVITY ON ARTIFICIAL AND NATURAL SURFACES IN CONSTRUCTED FRESH-WATER WETLANDS UNDER DIFFERENT HYDROLOGIC REGIMES	AQUATIC BOTANY												Four constructed freshwater marshes in midwestern USA were subjected to two hydrologic regimes of turbid river water. Two wetlands (high flow) received 41 cm of water depth per week and the other two wetlands (low flow) received 6-9 cm week. Periphyton samplers near the inflow and outflow of all four wetlands measured dry weight, organic dry weight and chlorophyll a every 2 weeks for one growing season. We also estimated periphyton growth on the dominant macrophytes (Polygonum amphibium L., Polygonum pennsylvanicum L., Phalaris arundinacea L., Typha angustifolia L. and Typha latifolia L.) three times in all four wetlands. Periphyton growth on artificial surfaces was higher in the high flow wetlands (P < 0.10). Inflow samplers in all wetlands had higher average chlorophyll a (0.4 vs. 0.2 mug cm-2), dry weight (3.0 vs. 1.0 mg cm-2) and organic dry weight (0.7 vs. 0.4 mg cm-2) than outflow samplers (P < 0.10). Epiphyte chlorophyll a, dry weight and organic dry weight, were highest on Polygonum spp. and lowest on Typha spp. (P < 0.10). Net epiphyte productivity ranged from 2 to 85 g carbon m-2 per year and was highest in a high flow wetland. Higher productivity in high flow wetlands and near the inflow was attributed to higher nutrient availability.																			0304-3770					JUN	1994	48	3-4					325	341		10.1016/0304-3770(94)90024-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(94)90024-8													WOS:A1994PH13800010

Phosphorus concentration was a poor predictor of epiphyton biomass when considered alone. Our data do not agree with previous studies that found that epiphyton biomass increased continuously with TP. Instead, we found a very weak, nonlinear relationship between TP and epiphyton biomass, where epiphyton biomass increased up to TP almost-equal-to 39-mu-g.L-1, and decreased at higher TP. Season and sampling depth accounted for significantly more variation in epiphyton biomass than did TP. Epiphyton biomass increased with depth in oligotrophic lakes but decreased with depth in eutrophic lakes. Seven common species of macrophytes of differing architecture developed significantly different epiphyton biomass. Macrophytes with flexible, ribbon-like leaves supported lower epiphyton biomass than species of broad-leaved or whorled architecture. The effect of host type on epiphyton algae biomass was not, however, as great as the influence of environmental variables.

Influence of biochemical, mineral and morphological features of natural food on tropical cladocerans	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Five laboratory experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of supplements of fatty acids and a green alga on the individual growth and reproduction of three species of tropical cladocerans Ceriodaphnia richardi, Daphnia ambigua, and D. gessneri feeding on natural seston from the Brazilian Lake Monte Alegre. Cohorts of newborns from cultivated females were submitted to one of the following treatments: (1) Natural seston, (2) Natural seston + microcapsules of EPA and DHA or linoleic and linolenic fatty acids, (3) Natural seston + oil-free microcapsules, and (4) Natural seston + green alga Scenedesmus spinosus (1 mg C l(-1)). Particulate organic carbon, algal carbon, C:P ratios of seston and green alga, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) content of seston and cladocerans, as well as phytoplankton composition, size, and shape were measured. The addition of fatty acids to seston did not significantly enhance growth and reproduction of the cladocerans, suggesting that sestonic PUFA content is sufficient for promoting cladoceran development, even in the cool-dry season when the fatty acids used in the experiments were 5-10 times lower in the seston than in the warm-wet season. Despite high C:P molar ratios in most experiments, there was only one indication of growth limitation by P. Reproduction was more affected than individual growth on some occasions by food quantity (energy) caused apparently by algal size, morphology, and digestion resistance. Energy availability, which is affected by algae morphological characteristics, seems to prevail over PUFA and P in controlling growth and reproduction of cladocerans in tropical Lake Monte Alegre.

The results obtained allow to consider the Yaounde Municipal Lake as an eutrophic lake. It harbours eight species of Gastrotricha belonging to four genera (Chaetonotus, Dasydytes, Neogossea and Polymerurus) of the order Chaetonotida. This community was characterized by high abundances of populations, and was dominated by the genus Neogossea and Chaetonotus reaching up to 2000 ind. L-1. Polymerurus was mostly abundant at the almost anoxic bottom layers. The highest abundances were found mostly during the rainy season, when there is an important sedimentation process of organic matter, and were influenced by several different environmental factors such as dissolved oxygen, temperature and pH of the water. Finally this community which may play an important role in the water bodies, is a potential water quality indicator. (C) 2007 Elsevier GmbH.

We describe the reproductive cycle of this bivalve mollusk on a beach (Nazaret) located along the straight that leads into Lake Maracaibo. During 12 months (January to December), 80 specimens were collected monthly from this beach. The animals were dissected and samples of their gonadal fluid were microscopically examined to detect gametes. The different stages of gonadal development are described according to Shafee, (1989). The gonad index was calculated by the equation IG = Sigma (n x V)/N. Results indicated that G demissa presents a continuous reproductive cycle, with mature, spawning animals occurring throughout the year. Two gametogenic processes occurred, one beginning during the dry season and extending until the onset of the rainy season, and another beginning during the rainy season and extending until late November, when the animals are once again mature. Two spawning peaks were observed, one in July and the other in December; 100% spawning in the population was not observed. Synchrony was found in spawning and maturation in both male and female mussels.

Several physical and chemical properties were measured in each lake (pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, transparency, nutrients), in order to interpret the structural and dynamic traits of the phytoplankton community. Important differences between the takes studied were put in evidence by means of multivariate techniques (Cluster Analysis and PCA). The shallow lakes densely populated by macrophytes hosted lowest phytoplanktonic densities, with average values ranging from 690 to 16500 algae ml-1. High species diversities were observed in these lakes (4.0-4.8). Lakes less colonized by macrophytes had higher phytoplankton densities. In some of them important blooms of Cyanophyceae were recorded, with between 60000 and 179000 algae ml 1, and concomitant low diversities. The results of this investigation support the hypothesis that the phytoplankton community is strongly influenced by the macrophytes, by direct competition and/or by competition from periphytic algae associated with higher plants.																			0018-8158					MAR 4	1994	277	1					49	62		10.1007/BF00023985	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00023985													WOS:A1994NB74300004

Post-Disturbance Plant Community Dynamics following a Rare Natural-Origin Fire in a Tsuga canadensis Forest	PLOS ONE												Opportunities to directly study infrequent forest disturbance events often lead to valuable information about vegetation dynamics. In mesic temperate forests of North America, stand-replacing crown fire occurs infrequently, with a return interval of 2000-3000 years. Rare chance events, however, may have profound impacts on the developmental trajectories of forest ecosystems. For example, it has been postulated that stand-replacing fire may have been an important factor in the establishment of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) stands in the northern Great Lakes region. Nevertheless, experimental evidence linking hemlock regeneration to non-anthropogenic fire is limited. To clarify this potential relationship, we monitored vegetation dynamics following a rare lightning-origin crown fire in a Wisconsin hemlock-hardwood forest. We also studied vegetation in bulldozer-created fire breaks and adjacent undisturbed forest. Our results indicate that hemlock establishment was rare in the burned area but moderately common in the scarified bulldozer lines compared to the reference area. Early-successional, non-arboreal species including Rubus spp., Vaccinium angustifolium, sedges (Carex spp.), grasses, Epilobium ciliatum, and Pteridium aquilinium were the most abundant post-fire species. Collectively, our results suggest that competing vegetation and moisture stress resulting from drought may reduce the efficacy of scarification treatments as well as the usefulness of fire for preparing a suitable seedbed for hemlock. The increasing prevalence of growing-season drought suggests that silvicultural strategies based on historic disturbance regimes may need to be reevaluated for mesic species.

J	Makhinov, AN				Makhinov, A. N.			Contrasting Landforms and Exogenous Processes in the Lower Amur Region	DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES												-It has been established that the formation of the relief of the Lower Amur region is due to the long history, differentiated tectonic movements, climatic features, and a complex permafrost pattern. Despite the low elevations of the mountain ridge tops, numerous traces of Quaternary glaciation, relict permafrost forms, and active manifestation of modern cryogenic processes on the highest peaks of the mountains have been found there for the first time. Data on the distribution and occurrence of permafrost strata within the Udyl'-Kizi and Evoron-Chukchagir lowlands point to their relict nature. Specific features of erosion-accumulative processes of mountain taiga rivers in the monsoon climate zone, caused by significant seasonal unevenness of the runoff, have been revealed. It is shown that the Amur River bed, crossing vast lowlands, forms complex floodplain-channel branches, in which the water flow and sediment deposits are being constantly redistributed between the branches. An assessment is given of the role of uneven floodplain sedimentation played in the emergence of various forms of mesorelief. The features of the formation of the floodplain and floodplain lakes under conditions of a deficit of traction load within the Lower Amur Lowland are revealed.

However, their aquatic ecology is increasingly threatened by human modifications to natural channel morphology. The lack of systematic investigation and understanding of the interactions between hydrodynamics, water quality, and aquatic ecology within large-scale, morphologically complex rivers has led to fragmented ecological management. This study investigates the large-scale responses of fish communities to complex channel morphologies through two comprehensive field surveys of hydrodynamics, water quality, and fish distribution along a similar to 30 km reach of the Yangtze River, encompassing channel narrowing, bifurcation, and the Yangtze River-Poyang Lake cascading confluence system. Both surveys observed elevated fish densities at the confluence and narrowing section, particularly with a distinct Confluence Hydro-Ecological Zone (CHEZ) within the post-confluence channel, marked by a pronounced increase in fish density and species diversity relative to both upstream and downstream sections. Mixing dynamics driven by the confluence momentum ratio (Mr) regulate the CHEZ: slow mixing in the equivalent momentum regime (Mr approximate to 1) amplified the increase in fish density within the CHEZ, while rapid mixing in the unequal momentum regime (Mr >> 1) weakened such effect but expanded the CHEZ. Density of large fish was primarily influenced by water depth and water-quality variability, whereas density of small fish was driven by seasonal population dynamics and hydrodynamic conditions. This study highlights that a comprehensive understanding of hydrodynamic configurations, water-quality contrasts, and seasonal biological dynamics at confluences can inform process-based strategies for sustainable river management.

However, knowledge of historical long-term changes in the timing, duration, and temperature of freeze-thaw processes remains insufficient, and studies exploring the combined or individual contributions of climatic factors-such as air temperature, precipitation, snow depth, and wind speed-are rare, particularly in current thermokarst landscapes induced by abrupt permafrost thawing. Based on ERA5-Land reanalysis, MODIS observations, and integrated thermokarst landform maps, we found that: 1) Hourly soil temperature from the reanalysis effectively captured the temporal variations of in-situ observations, with Pearson' r of 0.66-0.91. 2) Despite an insignificant decrease in daily freeze-thaw cycles in 1981-2022, other indicators in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) changed significantly, including delayed freezing onset (0.113 d yr- 1), advanced thawing onset (-0.22 d yr- 1), reduced frozen days (-0.365 d yr- 1), increased frozen temperature (0.014 degrees C yr- 1), and decreased daily freeze-thaw temperature range (-0.015 degrees C yr- 1). 3) Total contributions indicated air temperature was the dominant climatic driver of these changes, while indicators characterizing daily freeze-thaw cycles were influenced mainly by the combined effects of increased precipitation and air temperature, with remarkable spatial heterogeneity. 4) When regionally averaged, completely thawed days increased faster in the thermokarstaffected areas than in their primarily distributed grasslands-alpine steppe (47.69%) and alpine meadow (22.64%)-likely because of their stronger "warming effect" of precipitation. Locally, paired comparison within 3 x 3 pixel windows from MODIS data revealed consistent results, which were pronounced when the thermokarst-affected area exceeded about 38% per 1 km2. Conclusively, the "warming and wetting" climate has significantly altered soil freeze-thaw processes on the QTP, with the frozen soil environment in thermokarstaffected areas, dominated by thermokarst lakes, undergoing more rapid degradation. These insights are crucial for predicting freeze-thaw dynamics and assessing their ecological impacts on alpine grasslands.

It has a long half-life and can be distributed into aquatic environments as dissolved and gaseous species. To better understand its behavior in food webs, we simulated a freshwater food chain in a microcosm to investigate the contribution of sediment-derived C in freshwater animals. The natural abundance of 14C was used to estimate the contribution of sediment-derived C. The 14C/total carbon ratio in the sediment was highly depleted and thus ideal for partitioning C sources between sediment and food. An isotope mixing model was applied to estimate the proportion of sediment-derived C in the selected animals. The isotopic abundance of 15N was also used to further identify trophic levels in the animals. The findings revealed a significant contribution of sediment-derived C in blackworms (70-80 %), while only a small fraction was observed in the crucian carp (1-5 %). The findings identified sediment and fish food as the primary sources of C for worms and fish, respectively. Notably, the relative contribution of sediment-derived C was modulated by food availability. Specifically, uptake of sediment-derived C was higher in both species under conditions of limited food availability, and in fish when blackworms were absent. The findings may suggest higher uptake and potential radiological risks from sediment 14C in animals within brown food chains, particularly in overcrowded lakes with intense competition and during cold seasons when food is more limited.

This study supplements the second version of GIEMS (GIEMS-2) with other datasets to produce GIEMS-MethaneCentric (GIEMS-MC), a dynamically mapped dataset of methane-emitting waterlogged and inundated ecosystems. We separated open water from wetlands in GIEMS-MC by using the Global Lakes and Wetlands Database version 2 (GLWDv2) while adding unsaturated peatland areas undetected by GIEMS-2. Rice paddies are identified using the Monthly Irrigated and Rainfed Crop Areas (MIRCA2000) product. A specific coastal zone filtering is applied to avoid ocean artifacts while preserving coastal wetlands. GIEMS-MC covers the period 1992-2020 on a monthly scale at 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees spatial resolution. The GIEMS-MC product includes two layers of monthly wetland time series - one for flooded and saturated wetlands and another for all wetlands and peatlands - together with seven layers of compatible static maps of open water bodies (lakes, rivers, reservoirs) and seasonal rice paddy maps used in its production. The dominant vegetation and wetland types per pixel are also provided in GIEMS-MC variables. GIEMS-MC is compared to Wetland Area and Dynamics for Methane Modelling (WAD2M), a dataset providing dynamic wetland information. In terms of wetland extent, all wetlands and peatlands in GIEMS-MC and WAD2M show similar results, with a mean annual maximum of 7.7 Mkm(2) for GIEMS-MC and 6.8 Mkm2 for WAD2M, with similar spatial patterns in most regions. The GIEMS-MC seamless time series represents a significant advance in wetland representation for methane modelling, although limitations remain in the accurate identification of rice, coastal, and peatland areas.

J	Laybourn-Parry, J; Walton, M				Laybourn-Parry, J; Walton, M			Seasonal heterotrophic flagellate and bacterial plankton dynamics in a large oligotrophic lake - Loch Ness, Scotland	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Bacterial production in the 0-30 m water column of Loch Ness was measured using a dual labelling procedure with [H-3] thymidine and [C-14] leucine between May 1993 and June 1994. In most cases the uptake of the two labels did not covary, suggesting unbalanced growth. Rates of bacterial production varied from undetectable to 46.2 mu g Cl-1 day(-1). Highest production coincided with the period of highest primary production, but carbon derived from this source was insufficient to meet the bacterial carbon demand, which was met by allochthonous humic inputs to the system. 2. Heterotrophic flagellate (HNAN) grazing rates, measured using fluorescently labelled bacteria, ranged between 10.3 and 24.5 bacteria cell(-1) day(-1) at temperatures between 5 and 15 degrees C. They removed up to 27% of the bacterial production per day. 3. Heterotrophic flagellate specific growth rates ranged from 0.043 to 0.093 h(-1) between 5 and 15 degrees C, giving generation times of 7.4-16.1 h. 4. bacterial and HNAN abundances were not coupled, but the highest HNAN grazing impact related to a time of high bacterial productivity.																			0046-5070					FEB	1998	39	1					1	8		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00253.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00253.x													WOS:000072105100001

Those that receive effluent from the drainfields of onsite wastewater treatment systems (septic tanks) may contain pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) that escaped removal during treatment. This study examined the effects of seasonal rainfall variability on the assemblages and concentrations of fourteen PPCPs in two shallow lakes in West-Central Florida, USA: one surrounded by residents equipped with septic tanks and the other located within a nature preserve. Water samples were collected weekly during an 18-week interval from April to August 2021. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses revealed the omnipresence of five PPCPs: theophylline, caffeine, cotinine, DEET, and testosterone, although acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and sulfamethoxazole were also common. Of all the PPCPs detected, theophylline, DEET, and acetaminophen concentrations were higher during the wet season in the septic tank-influenced lake, while caffeine, cotinine, and testosterone concentrations decreased. In the lake located in the nature preserve, theophylline, caffeine, and acetaminophen levels increased in the wet season. In contrast, cotinine, DEET, and testosterone levels decreased. Overall, more compounds were detected during the wet season, with highly hydrophobic PPCPs (fluoxetine, atorvastatin, and octocrylene) only present during this period.					van Beynen, Philip/G-5653-2017															2076-3298				JUN 27	2025	12	7							219	10.3390/environments12070219	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/environments12070219													WOS:001539798500001

Here, through radiocarbon analysis of riverine CO2, CH4, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and sediment organic carbon (SOC), we show that DOC and SOC originate primarily from pre-aged C, and it is more readily degraded than modern C due to lower aromaticity, with microorganisms preferentially metabolizing permafrost-derived fractions. Pre-aged C accounts for >60% of both CO2 and CH4 emissions. CO2 derives mainly from pre-aged active layer C decomposition, with increased terrigenous fresh CO2 input entering rivers during the growing season. Notably, ancient permafrost C contributes up to similar to 30.5% of total CH4 emissions. Our findings highlight that ancient C released by alpine permafrost rivers substantially contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, emphasizing the need to improve global C models and formulate climate-resilient mitigation frameworks to support sustainable development.

Ecology of the River Darter in Canadian Waters: Distribution, Relative Abundance, Life-History Traits, Diet, and Habitat Characteristics	DIVERSITY-BASEL												The River Darter (Percina shumardi) is a native, rarely sampled fish that has been detected in relatively small numbers since the 1930s. It has a wide North American distribution, but little is known about the species biology and distribution across the Canadian portion of its range. We revisited many historic sampling locations and sampled additional areas to (i) confirm and update the distribution of River Darters in Canadian waters; (ii) assess relative abundance; (iii) update life history characteristics; (iv) collect diet information; and (v) identify characteristics of River Darter habitat. Since 1990, a total of 1032 River Darters were recorded from 29 waterbodies across three ecoregions. River Darters were observed in relatively high abundances in both the Saskatchewan-Nelson River and Southern Hudson Bay-James Bay ecoregions. While still extant in the Great Lakes-Upper St. Lawrence ecoregion, River Darters persist at low abundance. Life history analyses indicate similar maximum age (age 4) and growth (10 mm/year) to conspecific populations in the United States, while sex ratios are generally skewed towards female dominance. River Darter populations had high flexibility in habitat use and diet, using a range of flows and depths and a variety of seasonally available prey types.					; Pratt, Thomas/LTC-9063-2024	Pratt, Thomas/0009-0003-3648-2144; 														1424-2818				DEC	2016	8	4							22	10.3390/d8040022	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d8040022													WOS:000390134700005

The aim is to extend the knowledge of the genesis and distribution of microbial gases in the zone of mixing of fresh and salt waters with special attention to the effect of salinity, climate-related seasonality, and vertical sediment mixing. We found differences in the compositions of gas between the studied lakes and within each lake. These differences are mainly controlled by lake water depth and the presence of macrophytes. Due to the dissolution of rising bubbles in highly oxygenated water, the concentrations of CH4 and CO2 show up to 67% decline along the water column in favor of N-2 and O-2. On the other hand, in vegetated parts of the lakes, the CH4 is depleted in favor of CO2, and the residual CH4 and CO2 are enriched in C-13. Despite the fact that the coastal lakes display highly oxidizing conditions in the water column and that the bottom sediments are mixed by wind waves the CH4 reveals rather low oxidation. On the basis of the CH4/N-2 ratio we established that there are differences in the intensity of ebullition throughout the lakes. Higher intensities of ebullition were found in shallower parts of the lakes. Salinity has no effect on the stable C and H isotope composition of sediment gas. It seems, however, that salinity affects the molecular composition of hydrocarbons via preferential oxidation of CH4 under higher salinity conditions.

F. Muller) population in a highly humic boreal lake was followed throughout one growing season, and the amount of secondary production was estimated in relation to primary production and available food resources. The growth rate method was applied in the secondary production measurements. Daphnia longispina did not appear in the water column until 16 May, after which the animals were present throughout the growing season. The population showed three density peaks; the first appeared in early June, and the second and third in mid-July and at the beginning of September, respectively. Somatic production followed a seasonal pattern, with highest production rates in midsummer. The maximum value of 127 mg C m(-2) day(-1) was recorded at the beginning of July. The total annual net production of D. longispina was 7.9 g C m(-2). During most of the growing season, the primary productivity in the lake was well below 100 mg C m(-2) day(-1) and the total annual productivity of photosynthetic algae was 5.0 g C m(-2). We conclude that in this lake the zooplankton population did not rely on phytoplankton primary production as a sole carbon source, but that most of the carbon must have originated from bacterial production either directly or through a microbial loop.																			0142-7873					NOV	2001	23	11					1207	1215		10.1093/plankt/23.11.1207	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/23.11.1207													WOS:000171946200003

The Irano-Anatolian Hotspot, home to diverse and endangered fish species, remains largely unexplored in terms of MP contamination. This study aims to assess MP pollution in the Tigris, Euphrates, and Lake Van drainages by investigating MP abundance, size distribution, polymer composition, and potential pollution sources. Surface water (SW) and sediment (SD) samples were collected from multiple stations, and MPs were identified using microscopic and spectroscopic analyses. MP abundance in SW ranged up to 545.4 MPs/m(3), while SD samples exhibited values up to 33.2 MPs/kg. The results indicate that MP abundance is significantly higher near densely populated areas, suggesting a strong correlation with anthropogenic activities. The dominant MP types include fibers, fragments, and films, primarily composed of polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), pointing to sources, such as packaging materials, fishing gear, and laundry effluents. MP size distribution indicated that smaller particles (< 1 mm) accounted for 47.7% in SD, while larger MPs (> 1 mm) were more prevalent in SW (80.8%), highlighting the influence of hydrodynamic factors. These findings provide critical baseline data on MP pollution in the region while highlighting the urgent need for mitigation strategies. Taking into consideration, the potential bioavailability of MPs to aquatic organisms, future research should focus on seasonal variations and trophic transfer risks. Raising public awareness and implementing adaptive management strategies are essential for protecting the region's aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity.

In the present study, the water quality index (WQI) was used to evaluate the spatial and temporal contamination levels in Lake Yuriria, Guanajuato, Mexico. Water quality was monitored at 27 different locations (monitoring points) in the dry season (April) and after the rainy season (November), measuring 21 physicochemical water parameters, 2 biological parameters, and 19 metal concentrations. The data analysis revealed that Yuriria Lake is a eutrophic water body. Six monitoring points exhibited a poor WQI (25-50) in April, and seven monitoring sites were classified as having poor water quality in November. The remaining monitoring points showed a WQI categorized as fair (51-70) in both periods. The present study analyzes an extensive distribution of monitoring points over the lake's surface in two periods, showing a significant spatial and temporal representation of water quality. In addition, the major pollution sources identified include agricultural runoff and effluents from a nearby waterway and freshwater river. Finally, the key physicochemical parameters that determined the water quality were identified. BOD5, NH4+, P, orthophosphates, DO, conductivity, TSS, and color were linked to anthropogenic pollution sources, and Li, Ni, Zn, Cd, Ba, and Pb concentrations were linked to natural contamination sources. This study demonstrates the utility and versatility of these methodologies in water quality research, and it is the first spatial and temporal WQI analysis of Yuriria Lake.

Study focus: This study investigates the dynamics of Baseflow (BF) in five reservoirs critical to Tehran's water supply, using an 18-year dataset (1999-2016). While three digital filter methods were used to estimate daily baseflow in the studied reservoirs, the results from the Chapman-Maxwell method were selected for further investigation. Accordingly, daily streamflow data were processed using this method to separate baseflow and were aggregated monthly. The Baseflow Index (BFI), calculated as the ratio of mean BF to total streamflow, revealed BF contributions ranging from 55 % to 89 %, with soil moisture and snowmelt identified as dominant drivers. The BFAST algorithm detected breakpoints in BF trends, linking shifts to climatic variability and human activities like dam operations. Cross-correlation analysis highlighted SM (0-290 cm depth) as the strongest predictor of BF (CCF: 0.80-0.89), with immediate response times, while Smelt exhibited a seasonal lag (2-3 months). Snow cover, temperature, and vegetation (NDVI) also influenced BF, with NDVI showing a negative correlation due to increased water uptake. A Random Forest model, validated with 70 % training and 30 % testing data, confirmed SM's primacy (R2 up to 0.90 for Karaj Dam), followed by Smelt and humidity index. Breakpoints in BF trends, underscored the impact of land-use changes and climate shifts. New hydrological insights for the region: In populated urban areas like Tehran Metropolis where streamflow is critical for domestic water supply, analyzing the role of BF in streamflow of reservoirs supplying the water demands and identifying its driving factors within watersheds is crucial for sustainable water management. The findings advocate for watershed-specific strategies, including enhanced soil moisture retention and adaptive reservoir management, to mitigate water scarcity. This study provides a framework for sustainable water management in semi-arid regions, emphasizing the integration of remote sensing and hydrological modeling to address climate and anthropogenic pressures.

Effects of silica-limited growth on cell silica content, scale morphology, and the construction of the scale layer of Synura petersenii	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												The cells of synurophyte flagellates (algal class Synurophyceae, formerly included in the Chrysophyceae) are enclosed within a regularly imbricate layer of ornamented siliceous scales. Scale morphology is of critical taxonomic importance within this group of algae, and the scales are valuable indicator microfossils in paleolimnological studies. The data presented here demonstrate that scale morphology and the integrity of the scale layer can exhibit extreme variability in culture as a function of the cellular quota of silica under silica-limited growth. Silica-limited, steady-state populations of the colonial flagellate Synura petersenii Korsh, were maintained over a range of specific growth rates (mu = 0.11-0.69 days(-1)) and silica cell quotas (Q(si) = 0.13-2.40 pmoles Si . cell(-1)). Scale morphology and the organization of the scale layer became increasingly aberrant as silica stress increased. Under severe stress, scale deposition was completely suppressed so that cells appeared scale-free. This depression of scale deposition was reversible; populations of silica-starved, scale-free cells rapidly regenerated new scale layers when placed in batch culture and spiked with dissolved silica. During recovery from silica stress, cell division was repressed for 24 h while mean cell silica quota increased 25-fold. The first new scales appeared within 2 h after the silica addition, and development of the new scale layer proceeded in an approximately synchronous manner, resulting in normal scale layers on virtually all cells after 48 h of recovery in Si-rich medium. silica content of silica-replete Synura cells in comparable to freshwater diatoms of similar size, but Synura has much greater potential quota variability than diatoms and no apparent threshold silica requirement. Silica-limited growth kinetics and competition between diatoms and Synura for silica are discussed. The results suggest that morphological variability of siliceous scales in natural populations of synurophyte flagellates may result from silica stress and that the experimental approach developed here has great potential value as a means for circumscribing ecotypic variation in scale morphology. Results also demonstrate that scale production can be uncoupled from cell division, suggesting that urophyceae may be fundamentally different from that of diatoms (algal class Bacillariophyceae). This experimental system has application in the future study of the intracellular membrane systems and the regulatory processes involved in silica biomineralization.																				1529-8817				AUG	1996	32	4					675	692		10.1111/j.0022-3646.1996.00675.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-3646.1996.00675.x													WOS:A1996VD56800024
J	Andersen, T; Andersen, FO; Pedersen, O				Andersen, T; Andersen, FO; Pedersen, O			Increased CO2 in the water around Littorella uniflora raises the sediment O2 concentration	AQUATIC BOTANY												In the present study, we set up laboratory experiments with the isoetid plant Littorella uniflora to test whether higher water column CO2 concentrations affect (1) O-2 concentrations in leaves and sediment, and (2) nutrient dynamics in the porewater. The experiments showed that at 175 mu M CO2 in the water column, which is 10-fold atmospheric equilibrium, a higher biomass of L. uniflora developed (from 302 +/- 51 to 390 +/- 86 g dry wt m(-2)) and there were higher O-2 concentrations in the leaves (from 120 up to 160% of air saturation) and in the porewater of the sediment (1.7-fold higher). The O-2 concentration in particular increased in the upper 10-30 mm of the sediment at the elevated CO, concentrations. The increase in biomass of L. uniflora mostly derived from a significant increase in the leaf biomass (from 97 +/- 14 to 137 +/- 21 g DW m(-2)). while root biomass at high CO2 (253 +/- 82 g dry wt m(-2)) was similar to that of plants growing at low CO2 (205 +/- 40 a dry wt m(-2)). This implied that the increase in O-2 concentration in the sediment was a result of increased O-2 production in the leaves rather than of increased root biomass. Porewater samples from three sediment depths (20, 70 and 120 mm) showed reduced NO3- concentrations at high CO2 concentration, especially at 20 mm depth layer (mean values for low CO2 ranged from 25 to 60 mu M while they were below 25 mu M at high CO2 presumably as a result of uptake by L. uniflora. NH4(+) concentrations increased with depth (from nearly 0 up to 100 mu M) but were not significantly related to the CO2 concentration. The PO43- concentrations were low (less than 0.5 mu M) and similar at both low and high CO2 treatments at all three depths. The study showed that photosynthesis of L. uniflora is limited by CO2 at ambient concentrations and that higher CO2 concentrations result in higher O-2 release to the sediment which is important for the cycling and retention of nutrients in sediments of oligotrophic softwater lakes.

J	Steffen, H; Kaufmann, G				Steffen, H; Kaufmann, G			Numerical modelling of deformation changes induced by lake-level fluctuations of the Hohenwarte reservoir, Thuringia, Germany	JOURNAL OF GEODYNAMICS												The Hohenwarte reservoir in southeast Thuringia (Germany) is a medium-sized artificial reservoir, holding on average 180 million m(3) of water. It was constructed between 1936 and 1943 and is operational since then. The water load impounded induces stress and deformations of the underlying crust and upper mantle. The Geodynamic Observatory Moxa is located around 4 km to the north. The observatory is equipped with seismometers and sensitive tilt- and strainmeters, accurate to the nrad and nstrain range. We explore the deformation effects caused by the water load of the Hohenwarte reservoir, both on a short-term seasonal time scale and a long-term decadal time scale. The seasonal effect, mainly induced by elastic deformation, results in tilt and strain deformation in the 4 mu rad and 1 mu strain ranges, respectively. Long-term decadal variations, however, are unlikely to be significant, if a realistic viscoelastic structure of the underlying upper mantle is used. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Mean flying distances between colony and fishing site were estimated at 22 and 15 km respectively. Birds from the Naardermeer colony carried out less trips but of a longer duration than birds from Oostvaardersplassen, most markedly so in the chick rearing period (2 trips per day of 185 min vs. 3 trips of 165 min). Daily fluctuations in time spent away from the colony were clearly dependent on daily shifts in main fishing sites. On days when fishing was concentrated at larger distances, individual foraging trips lasted longer, due to the increase in flying time. Neither net fishing time nor daily fish consumption, as estimated by pellet analyses, compensated for the increment in time and energy expenditure on those days. It was estimated that the average daily energy expenditure would amount to about 2.8 . BMR (basal metabolic rate) in birds from Naardermeer and to about 2.7 . BMR in birds from Oostvaardersplassen. Fish consumption estimates based on pellet analyses led to an estimated DME (daily metabolisable energy) of 2 . BMR for both colonies. Thus, an overall negative energy balance became apparent, resulting in estimated mass losses throughout the breeding season of on average 980 and 860 g for Naardermeer and Oostvaardersplassen birds, respectively. Mass losses are likely to be higher with increasing travelling distances, indicating that travelling distance may influence reproductive output. This could be one of the factors causing consistently lower reproductive outputs at the Naardermeer throughout the years.																			0373-2266						1995	83	1					223	234																WOS:A1995RM43100024
J	BURKE, RA				BURKE, RA			POSSIBLE INFLUENCE OF HYDROGEN CONCENTRATION ON MICROBIAL METHANE STABLE HYDROGEN ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION	CHEMOSPHERE					NATO ADVANCED RESEARCH WORKSHOP ON ATMOSPHERIC METHANE : SOURCES, SINKS AND ROLE IN GLOBAL CHANGE	OCT 07-11, 1991	MT HOOD, OR	NATO, NATL SCI FDN, US EPA, ANDARZ				Factors affecting the stable hydrogen isotopic composition (deltaD) of important sources of microbial methane to the atmosphere include oxidation, methanogenic precursor (e.g., acetate vs. CO2/H-2), and the deltaD of the environmental water. Variations in hydrogen gas concentrations or rates of interspecies hydrogen transfer resulting from variations in organic matter degradation rates may also affect deltaD-CH4. Methane produced via CO2 reduction by laboratory cultures (Balabane et al., 1987) was about 150 parts per thousand more D-depleted than methane produced in shallow marine sediments from CO2/H-2. ne dissolved hydrogen gas concentration in that laboratory culture was about 1 mM; whereas, hydrogen concentrations in methane-zone sediments typically range between 10 and 100 nM (e.g., Conrad, 1989). The relatively greater hydrogen isotope fractionation in the culture appears to result from the incorporation into methane of protons that are produced intracellularly from the hydrogenase-catalyzed oxidation of hydrogen gas. As rumen basal hydrogen concentrations are typically greater than 1 muM (Smolenski and Robinson, 1988), this mechanism may explain why ruminant methane is more D-depleted (Wahlen et al., 1990) than methane produced via CO2 reduction in natural sedimentary environments. This process may also contribute to the wide variation in sedimentary deltaD-CH4 observed in natural wetlands.																			0045-6535					JAN-FEB	1993	26	1-4					55	67		10.1016/0045-6535(93)90412-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0045-6535(93)90412-X													WOS:A1993KM22500006

NYSACS is a prospective cohort study conducted among New York State registered sportsmen and fishermen. Sport fish consumption information for New York State waters including the Great Lakes between June 1990 and June 1991 were collected through self-administered questionnaires, Spouses of male anglers were asked to provide their husbands' fish consumption during the same time period. A short telephone interview after the cohort was ascertained was also conducted among about 100 study participants for the purpose of quality control. Percentage agreement, kappa, and weighted kappa were calculated to evaluate the reliability of the interview using spousal data and reinterview data. Overall, for the total fish consumption between June 1990 and June 1991, percentage agreement, kappa, and weighted kappa between spousal data and primary response were 67.28%, 0.5087, and 0.6157, respectively. For reinterview data, weighted kappa ranged from 0.4510 to 0.5285 for season-specific analysis and kappa ranged from 0.4615 to 0.7006 for fish species-specific analysis. Spouses may be a good source of proxy data for fish consumption. The reliability of sport fish consumption data for the NYSACS study is acceptable, suggesting that the food frequency measuring methods employed are a viable approach to obtain retrospective sport fish consumption data from sportsmen and subsistence anglers.

Items of aquatic origin constituted most of the biomass in diets of both nestlings and adults. Molluscs and Ephemeroptera (mayflies), whose distributions in the study wetlands were strongly influenced by pH, were eaten by swallows, particularly nestlings. The major change in nestling diet in relation to wetland acidity was a decrease in mayflies and a corresponding increase in aquatic Diptera at wetlands of lower pH. The number of aquatic taxa eaten by nestlings was lowest at acidic wetlands. The total biomass of emerging insects captured at acidic wetlands was not lower than at wetlands of higher pH, and in fact tended to be greater. The rate at which swallows fed their young and the amount of food fed to nestlings were not related to wetland pH or other wetland characteristics. Nevertheless, the reduced availability of calcium-rich foods at acidic wetlands and the change in types of food available may play a role in the reduced reproductive success of swallows at acidic wetlands.																			0008-4301					OCT	1991	69	10					2629	2637		10.1139/z91-370	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z91-370													WOS:A1991HD70900017

The Yangtze River Basin (YRB) features vast subtropical forests, which are vital for global hydrological, carbon, and energy flows. Investigating the influence of the water supply on vegetation dynamics in this basin is crucial, particularly in light of the challenges posed by climate change. However, the response of vegetation to different water sources remains poorly understood. To address this gap, this study explores the influence of precipitation, surface runoff, and soil water on vegetation growth in the YRB via hydrologic modelling and remote sensing data from 2003 to 2021. The results revealed a decreasing trend in drought-prone areas. The overall vegetation growth has progressively improved despite challenges posed by water scarcity. More areas in the YRB are affected by water shortages than surpluses in terms of vegetation growth. During the growing season, vegetation is primarily affected by water shortage, although in exceptional cases, it is constrained by excess water, which typically occurs during the nongrowing season. In the upper and middle Jinsha River Basin, vegetation growth is primarily restricted by water surpluses, while in the middle and lower YRB, constraints commonly arise from water deficits. Additionally, surface runoff and soil moisture play more significant roles in influencing vegetation growth than precipitation. By revealing the dynamics of the vegetation-water correlation, our research aims to provide valuable insights for managing the dynamic balance between water and vegetation in subtropical regions.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				JUN	2025	175								113524	10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.113524	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.113524													WOS:001482799000001

A comprehensive study was conducted on Baiyang Lake and its tributary estuaries to investigate the occurrence and seasonal variation of 14 commonly used antibiotics. The results showed that most antibiotics had higher concentrations in the dry season. Additionally, Baiyang Lake demonstrated a dilution effect, with higher concentrations observed in the tributary estuaries. In sediments, the occurrence and distribution of antibiotics were influenced by common sources of contamination and their complex interactions with heavy metals. Analysis of potential sources indicated that the antibiotics in Baiyang Lake primarily originated from human medicine, livestock farming and aquaculture. Ecological risk assessment of antibiotics revealed higher risk levels during the dry season compared to the wet season, with tributary rivers exhibiting higher risk levels than Baiyang Lake. In sediment, the combined antibiotic and heavy metal toxicity risk (& sum;& sum;TRI) also presented higher risk levels in the dry season. Compared to previous studies, antibiotic contamination in Baiyang Lake has become more multipolar. This shift may be influenced by factors such as the overuse of antibiotics, regional development, national control policies, and advancements in wastewater treatment technology. This study enhances the understanding of antibiotic occurrence, seasonal variations, ecological risks, and the impact of national policies and regional development on contamination in Baiyang Lake. Additionally, it provides valuable insights for the management of antibiotics and pollution control in freshwater lakes.

Study focus: A railroad causeway divides the Great Salt Lake into north and south arms and significantly alters natural lake dynamics. A new opening in the causeway, referred to as the New Breach, was completed in December 2016 to manage exchange flows between the north and south arms and control salinity primarily in the south arm. Salinity data have been collected independently by multiple stakeholders using different monitoring techniques and instrumentation. To overcome inconsistent data and provide a holistic record of salinity conditions, new methods were developed for curating and compiling all relevant disparate salinity data into a daily representative time series with quantified uncertainties for the south arm of the lake. New hydrological insights for the region: This dataset was used to characterize the altered spatial and temporal patterns of salinity within the south arm during varied hydrologic periods while considering the effects of the New Breach. Results, contextualized by data uncertainties, inform lake management by showing that the New Breach exchange flows influence lake salinity, but the primary controls are related to the balance between river inflows and evaporation. While considering dataset limitations, insights are provided regarding how monitoring at the Great Salt Lake may be improved to better support active lake management efforts.

Spatial changes in nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations primarily occur at the inlet and outlet of reservoirs, while temporal changes often exhibit seasonal patterns. At a global scale, phosphorus is preferentially removed from reservoirs compared to nitrogen. The factors influencing the transport and transformation processes of nitrogen and phosphorus in reservoirs include the physicochemical properties of water bodies and human activities. Additionally, nitrogen dynamics are affected by reservoir age, storage capacity, and water storage regulation modes, whereas phosphorus dynamics are also influenced by hydrodynamic conditions. Finally, this review summarizes the impact of damming on the downstream ecological environment and outlines future research directions, providing theoretical support for the management of river-reservoir ecosystems and promoting the green and sustainable development of hydropower in the context of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals.

The detection frequencies and concentrations of UVAs in 2016 were significantly higher than those in 2015.2-Ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate and homosalate (HMS) were the predominant UVAs in the sediment samples. The total UVA concentration range in sediment samples was 0.15-85.3 ng/g. The spatial distribution results showed that UVAs were concentrated in the northwest of Taihu Lake. The total organic carbon content may affect the fate of UVAs in sediments. Source analysis and correlation analysis showed that the following compounds had high proportions and significant correlations: 2-ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, ethylhexyl salicylate, and HMS in 2015; and benzophenone-3, HMS, and benzyl salicylate in 2016. These results indicated the correlated compounds within each year had the same source. Ecological risk assessment results showed that UVAs in sediment from Taihu Lake may present a moderate risk to benthic organisms. The risk quotient of UVAs in 2016 was slightly higher than that in 2015. The seasonal pollution characteristics of UVAs and their comprehensive environmental risks should receive further attention.

Despite the crucial role of aquatic plants in landscape construction and pollutant removal within urban lakes, the modulation of N2O emission dynamics and associated mechanisms by these plants remains elusive. This study investigated the N2O concentrations and fluxes from aquatic habitats covered with seven species of aquatic plants in a small urban lake, and estimated the contribution of plant-mediated N2O emissions. Meanwhile, the physicochemical parameters of water and periradicular sediments were measured synchronously to clarify the main controls of aquatic plants in regulating aquatic N2O emissions. N2O concentrations in the surface waters covered by different aquatic plants (0.041-0.659 mu mol L- 1) exhibit substantial variation, being 1.2-5.4 (mean of 2.8) times higher than those in open water areas (0.015-0.096 mu mol L- 1). The range of total N2O fluxes was 11.3-1009.0 mu mol m-2 d- 1, exhibiting significant spatial and temporal variations, with considerable differences observed among various plant-covered areas. Total N2O fluxes from different plant-covered areas were 1.5-16.7 times (average 7.5 times) higher than those in open water areas. It suggests that diverse aquatic plants could observably intensify the spatial variability in N2O emissions within the small urban lake. The estimated plant-mediated fluxes may contribute approximately 21%-66% of total N2O fluxes. Specifically, N2O concentrations in the stem cavities of different plants were generally higher than atmospheric levels, evidencing the mediated effect of aquatic plants on N2O emissions. While aquatic plants reduce the abundance of nutrients in surface water to varying degrees, the accumulations of carbon and nitrogen in periradicular sediments, combined with plant transport, observably enhance N2O emissions in urban lake with low pollution loads. Furthermore, the phenological processes of aquatic plants and seasonal temperature changes were found to co-affect the seasonal dynamics of aquatic N2O fluxes. Varied aquatic plants can significantly dominate spatiotemporal dynamics of the N2O emissions in urban landscape lakes.

An abundant non-native freshwater copepod, Arctodiaptomus dorsalis, on the Island of Hawai'i: distribution, dominance, dispersal, and diapause	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												The freshwater calanoid copepod, Arctodiaptomus dorsalis, native to countries around the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, is now widely distributed and dominant in fresh waterbodies on the Island of Hawai'i. We show that it makes diapausing eggs, providing a likely mechanism enhancing dispersal both across the Pacific Ocean and among local waterbodies. Dense populations of A. dorsalis have been found in one lake and 10 of 15 sampled ponds. In two years of biweekly sampling of two permanent ponds it was abundant to the near exclusion of other zooplankton. Although these two ponds are located only 55 m apart and connected by an intermittent stream, the prevalence and seasonal timing of diapause differed markedly between populations. The diapause differences appear to be local adaptation within the 34 years since pond construction: the population with greater diapause experiences greater fluctuations in pond volume, principally during the dry season (May to October), with timing and prevalence of diapause corresponding well with a model of optimal trait expression. The other population with very little diapause experiences only minor fluctuations in pond volume. Rapid local adaptation following introduction likely enhances the species' success in Hawai'i. Characteristics of A. dorsalis on Hawai'i Island consistent with calling it "invasive" include that it is non-native, introduced by humans, invasive elsewhere globally, spreading locally, with a dispersing phenotype (diapausing eggs), reproduces and survives where present, and is nearly always abundant and dominant. An impact on the planktonic food web remains conjecture, but is likely based on its local dominance and what is known of its feeding ecology elsewhere.

A nature-based solution through lake bathymetry restoration	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, is a critical water resource and ecological hub. However, seasonal dryness has raised significant concerns about the sustainability of its hydrological regime. Study focus: This study investigates the potential of morphological restoration as a nature-based solution to mitigate Poyang Lake's seasonal water shortages. A hydrodynamic model simulated water level, depth, and velocity changes under four scenarios where the lakebed morphology of three severely incised areas was restored to 1998 conditions. The simulations evaluated the hydrodynamic impacts of restoration, focusing on its implications for water resource management and ecological functions. New hydrological insights for the region: Results revealed significant impacts of bathymetry restoration, particularly during low-water-level periods. Water depth in the upstream main channel increased by 0.5-2.5 m and by 0.1-0.5 m in the floodplain during the dry season. Water velocity showed contrasting trends, decreasing by 0.01-0.1 m/s in the main channel and increasing by 0.01-0.1 m/s in the floodplain. Nonlinear correlations between water depth increases and baseline water levels highlighted the most pronounced effects during dry seasons. The study demonstrates that bathymetry restoration may be a promising strategy for addressing water shortages in the dry season. However, trade-offs among multiple ecosystem services and an optimization procedure should be used in future to select the different opportunities for restoration planning.

Water quality is not only compromised by factors such as land use, seasonality, and human activities, but it is also vulnerable to climate conditions. This study explored the influence of land cover in sub-catchment and riparian areas on surface water quality, considering temporal, seasonal, and climatic variations. Ten sampling points were selected in a Brazilian populous watershed. Water quality data and semi-automatic land cover classifications were collected, providing a combined remote sensing and statistical analysis. The results indicated that increased urban development in the watershed negatively impacts water quality. Anthropogenic areas have a strong negative correlation with water quality in both sub-catchment and riparian area, with urbanized (rho = -0.69 and rho = -0.60; p-value <0.001) and exposed soil (rho = -0.45 and rho = -0.42; p-value <0.001) areas having the greatest effect. Forest cover in riparian areas is crucial for minimizing pollutant transfer to water bodies (rho = 0.41), even in dry or rainy periods (rho = 0.45 and rho = 0.37, respectively). The Redundancy Analysis (RDA) indicates that urban areas negatively affect water quality with key contaminants such as organic matter, solids and Escherichia coli. This study emphasizes the challenges posed to water quality by urbanization and the importance of adaptive analysis beyond seasonal patterns, underscoring the need for effective policies and targeted conservation strategies for safeguarding water resources and ecosystem health.

However, studies on their population status and habitat characteristics are limited, with no scientific research conducted on their nesting ecology to date. Therefore, we selected muggers as a representative species to better understand their daytime sightings, nesting characteristics, and the fine-scale anthropogenic and environmental factors influencing their occurrence in five lakes of the Beeshazari Lake complex (BLC; Beeshazar Lake, Kumal Lake, Tikauli Lake, Kingfisher Lake, and Batuli Pokhari) of Chitwan National Park, Nepal. We conducted a preliminary survey, followed by a daytime sightings survey, a nesting site survey, and a habitat assessment survey in March 2023. A generalised linear model under binary logistic regression was used to analyse the factors influencing the habitat characteristics of muggers. During the research period, 50 detections of muggers were recorded, 66% of which were observed basking and 34% were submerged in the lakes. The Relative Abundance Index of the muggers in the BLC was 3.29 km-1. Nesting sites (two from Tikauli Lake and three from Beeshazar Lake) were recorded during the study period. The probability of sighting a mugger was significantly influenced by the slope (moderate slope), substrate type (clay, grass, and sand), mid-lake depth, presence of anthropogenic threats, and presence of invasive species. We recommend that future researchers employ more robust models, such as N-mixture models, to provide up-to-date information on the population abundance of muggers in the BLC. Furthermore, a comprehensive multi-seasonal study focusing on ecological and behavioural aspects of nesting sites alongside environmental aspects influencing nest success rates is critical. Such research will be crucial in guiding the development of targeted conservation strategies aimed at protecting and preserving essential nesting sites. Moreover, we recommend conducting robust studies on the carrying capacity of wetlands in Nepal to provide insights into the sustainable population size that a wetland can support.					; Miya, Mahamad Sayab/AEA-3728-2022	Miya, Mahamad Sayab/0000-0002-1675-593X; Adhikari, Hari/0000-0002-9089-3249; 													2045-7758					JUN	2025	15	6							e71486	10.1002/ece3.71486	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.71486								40496218					WOS:001505098500001

By integrating earth observation data into a water balance approach, we quantify variables that are typically challenging to measure, such as groundwater overdraft and non-growing season water use for soil preparation. A key aspect of agricultural water management in the region is utilizing water from reservoirs. Here we introduce a novel approach that combines optical remote sensing with satellite laser altimetry to monitor the availability and use of active water storage in reservoirs. New hydrological insights for the region: Results indicate that water from reservoir storage satisfies up to 14.9 % +/- 2.2 % of the annual demand, but another 11.5 % +/- 5.2 % are groundwater withdrawals. Our analysis indicates a necessary average annual reduction in groundwater extractions by at least 8.0 % +/- 1.6 % for sustainability. Additionally, highly energy-intensive water pumping from Amu Darya River provides more than half of the water resources used in Bukhara and Kashkadarya, resulting in a significant carbon footprint of the region's agricultural production. The detailed breakdown of water uses and irrigation water consumption by crop type informs efficient, sustainable water management, offering new opportunities for agricultural water accounting in Central Asian irrigation oases.																				2214-5818				JUN	2025	59								102414	10.1016/j.ejrh.2025.102414	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2025.102414													WOS:001483119800001

A novel framework for wetland health assessment using hydro-ecological indicators and landscape metrics	MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT												Wetlands are invaluable ecosystems that provide essential ecological services and require continuous monitoring. This study presents a novel framework to assess the Wetland Health Index (WHI) using an indicator-based approach. The framework integrates hydro-ecological indicators, including water extent (MNDWI), vegetation health (NDVI), and water quality (NDTI), along with hydrogeomorphic (HGM) and shoreline dynamics (SLC) indicators, as well as landscape and class-level metrics. A total of 13 indicators were employed to evaluate ecosystem health using multi-temporal Landsat imagery. The framework was applied to assess the health of the Bhoj Wetland, a Ramsar site in India, from 1990 to 2022, covering both pre- and post-monsoon seasons. Results showed that 74.14% of the wetland exhibited moderate to good health in the pre-monsoon season, increasing to 88.03% post-monsoon. Core areas showed relatively better health, whereas edge zones experienced degradation due to urban encroachment and agricultural activities. However, challenges persist, including excessive vegetation growth, moderate turbidity, reduced water extent, and shoreline encroachment. Over 32-year study period, vegetation density increased, leading to the proliferation of invasive species, particularly at the edges, threatening biodiversity. Turbidity remained moderate, with higher levels in shallow areas due to nutrient runoff and sediment trapping by vegetation. Shoreline analysis revealed 36.46% of the area undergoing erosion, with habitat fragmentation more pronounced in the pre-monsoon season. This health assessment framework provides a scientific approach for wetland planning and management, enabling stakeholders in making informed decisions for conservation and restoration. Furthermore, this framework has the potential to be adapted for assessing the health of other wetlands. The study emphasizes the importance of sustainable wetland management in achieving several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 6, 12, 15).

JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study Region: The Laurentian Great Lakes basin Study focus: This study analyzed key hydroclimate components across the entire Laurentian Great Lakes basin, one of the largest freshwater basins on Earth and home to roughly 20% of all fresh, unfrozen surface water. The hydroclimate components analyzed included surface air temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration (ET), snow water equivalent (SWE), runoff, and surface soil moisture from 1951 to 2020. Hydrological variables were simulated using regional customization of the Weather Research and Forecasting hydrological model (WRF-Hydro), and changes in the annual magnitude and seasonal variability (i.e. seasonality) of all variables were assessed. New hydrological insights for the region: Our findings reveal significant spatial and temporal variations in hydroclimate variables across the basin. The Great Lakes basin is experiencing noteworthy changes in hydroclimate variables, including pronounced rises in surface air temperature, ET, and runoff (low flow), as well as declines in SWE. The distinct spatial patterns of changes in magnitude and seasonality are identified throughout the region. For instance, the Superior basin exhibits unique hydrological patterns, including an earlier peak in SWE and decreased high flow, both of which are influenced by its unique climatic and geographical conditions. This long-term analysis of hydroclimate trends provides valuable insights into historical hydrological changes and their implications for future conditions in the Great Lakes basin, emphasizing the need for localized studies and targeted management strategies.

Particularly in severe cold regions, transitional seasons present significant thermal comfort challenges. This study focuses on South Lake Park in Changchun, a city in cold regions, to investigate the relationship between green visibility, microclimate factors, and thermal comfort across different landscape spaces. Field surveys, microclimate measurements, and questionnaires were conducted to analyze the effects of the Sky View Factor (SVF) and Green View Index (GVI) on thermal comfort. The results reveal that the thermal comfort threshold during transitional seasons in Changchun ranges from 16.01 degrees C to 22.68 degrees C, with a neutral temperature of 19.34 degrees C. In square space, SVF and GVI positively influence Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET), while in waterfront space and sparsely forest space, SVF has a positive effect and GVI has a negative effect on PET. In densely forest space, both SVF and GVI negatively impact PET. The study proposes optimization strategies based on these findings, emphasizing the need for targeted SVF and GVI designs in different landscape spaces to enhance thermal comfort and provide valuable insights for urban planning.

Influence of the source and molecular weights on sulfathiazole/sulfadiazine binding in sedimentary dissolved organic matter	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Sedimental dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays a crucial role in the migration of antibiotics in a lake environment, which is strongly associated with its physicochemical properties influenced by temporal and spatial variations. This study systematically investigated the binding behavior of sulfathiazole (ST) and sulfadiazine (SD) to DOM across different molecular weights (MWs) in sediments from Poyang Lake using multiple spectroscopic techniques. Results showed that the MW fractions of DOM from the onset of the dry season were higher than those before flooding. Additionally, key carbon parameters, including dissolved organic carbon and fluorescent components, were present in greater proportion in the truly dissolved phase and the low MW fraction of DOM. These properties of the low MW fraction of DOM enhanced its binding capacity for the two sulfonamides, with the partitioning coefficient (logKcoc) values of 5.20 and 5.06 for ST and SD, respectively. Dialysis experiments investigating the interaction between different concentrations of DOM and sulfonamides indicated that humiclike and protein-like components significantly influenced the migration of ST and SD, respectively. Moreover, protein-like components exerted a more substantial impact on the migration of sulfonamides in heavily polluted sampling sites, while the humic-like substances played a more significant role for the samples from the wetland protection area. The results enhanced the understanding of the significance of DOM sources and MW in influencing the environmental fate of antibiotics in lake ecosystems.					; Zhou, John/E-7610-2011	/0000-0003-1393-1608; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				JUN	2025	386								125795	10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.125795	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.125795								40382925					WOS:001502646800006
J	Zhang, C; Chen, WB; Huang, FF				Zhang, Cheng; Chen, Wenbo; Huang, Fangfang			Determining the suitable ecological water level based on the response relationship between landscape connectivity and water level: A case study of Poyang Lake, China	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Water level is an important indicator of hydrological regime of lake, and its spatio-temporal variation has a profound impact on habitat quality and biodiversity conservation. How to determine the suitable ecological water level has long been a hot issue in ecohydrology research. Taking Poyang Lake as a case and from the perspective of habitat, this study firstly used the range of variability approach (RVA) to analyze the natural water level regime of the lake. Then, the probability of connectivity (PC) was applied to analyze the dynamics of grassland connectivity and water connectivity after identifying the distribution pattern of grassland and water body at different water levels. Finally, the natural water level regime was corrected to the suitable ecological water level based on the response relationship between grassland connectivity, water connectivity and water level. The results showed as follows: (1) The annual variation of water level in Poyang Lake showed a significant unimodal distribution, with high water level in flood season from April to September and low water level in dry season from October to March of the following year. The annual water level can reach the highest of 22.63 m in July and the lowest of 7.12 m in February from 2000 to 2020. (2) The grassland and water body constitute the main habitats of Poyang Lake wetland. Under the disturbance of hydrological process, they presented the unique dynamic tradeoff relationships of "One shrinks while the other expands" and "One is fragmented while the other is connected", respectively. With the increase of water level, grassland connectivity decreased dramatically while water connectivity increased progressively. (3) The annual demand for suitable ecological water level is 14.82-15.65 m. In the wet season, the threshold of suitable ecological water is 14.82-16.96 m, while it is 11.75-14.82 m in the dry season. The threshold of monthly suitable ecological water level from January to December is successively as follows: 9.89-14.82, 9.99-14.82, 12.12-14.82, 13.29-14.82, 14.82-15.69, 14.82-14.86, 14.82-16.12, 14.82-15.13, 14.82-16.46, 14.65-14.82, 12.38-14.82 and 10.31-14.82 m.

One of the lakes is eutrophic and polluted due to a paper and pulp mill, one is oligotrophic and in a natural state, and the other two lakes are eutrophic. The prevalence of Dactylogyrus infection was always high. Differences between the lakes and the years were observed in the intensity of infection, which was significantly higher in the polluted lake. The intensity was also higher in older fish. Nine Dactylogyrus species were found, and of these D. crucifer and D. nanus were numerically dominant in all of the lakes studied, especially in the oligotrophic lake. In 1986 D.fallax, D. similis and D. suecicus constituted significant proportions of the fauna in the polluted lake. D. micracanthus was most common in the eutrophic lakes. In 1988 the species composition in the polluted lake was most similar to that in the eutrophic lake.																			0020-7519	1879-0135				SEP	1991	21	5					565	572		10.1016/0020-7519(91)90061-B	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0020-7519(91)90061-B								1743852					WOS:A1991GK84300010

The lagoon is a shallow, oligohaline, hypertrophic ecosystem in which Cyanophyceae, Chlorophyceae and phytoflagellates are dominant. Between October 1990 and August 1993, weekly integrated samples were collected from a bay, using a plexiglass tube, 8 cm diameter and Im length. All identifications, descriptions and measurements were carried out on live or in Lugol-fixed material. A total of 30 taxa, belonging to Euglenophyceae (5), Cryptophyceae (7), Raphidophyceae (1), Dinophyceae (4), Chrysophyceae (3), Prymnesiophyceae (2), Prasinophyceae (7) and Chlorophyceae(1) were identified. All the phytoflagellate species identified have been recorded previously from temperate sites. Nine of them were registered in a tropical water for the first time, suggesting that they have much broader distributions. Gymnodinium sanguineum, Pavlova lutheri and Pyramimonas grossii were the most frequently observed phytoflagellates in this study. The seasonal occurrence and some environmental requirements of selected phytoflagellates species are discussed.

J	Koelmans, AA				Koelmans, AA			Geochemistry of suspended and settling solids in two freshwater lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This study describes the 1987-1992 time variation of the bulk chemical composition, levels of heavy metals, arsenic, nitrogen and phosporous in suspended and settling solids in Lake Volkerak and Lake Zoom (The Netherlands). Suspended and setling solids were collected with continuous flow centrifuges and sediment traps, respectively. The relations between solids characteristics and metal concentrations in the particles were investigated using correlation and factor-analysis. Heavy metals, except manganese, were associated with clay content of the particles and with organic carbon which was mainly determined by phytoplankton growth. Manganese was correlated with Org-C only. Clay and organic matter with associated heavy metals showed negative trends on all locations, and a seasonality due to algal biomass dilution. It is concluded that the trophic state significantly affects trace metal cycling. Sediment traps collect different types of particles than continuous flow centrifuges. The traps collect particles with higher clay content, lower Org-C concentrations and higher Org-C/N elemental ratios than the centrifuges.

Here, we provide a first comprehensive survey of the carbon (C) biogeochemistry of the Lake Alaotra system, a large shallow lake (surface of 200 km2 and maximum depth of 2 m) surrounded by an extensive floodplain and rice fields located in the highlands of Madagascar. The current landscape in the region is grassland-dominated and dotted by major gullies called "lavaka", which have historically been claimed to lead to high erosion rates and would, thus, also mobilize large amounts of soil C. We investigated the seasonal variability in the concentrations and stable isotope ratios of inorganic and organic C pools; moreover, we examined a range of other relevant proxies, including physicochemical parameters, dissolved CO2 and CH4 concentrations, total alkalinity, and chlorophyll a (Chl a) from spatially distributed sampling and seasonal monitoring of several rivers. While rivers were found to carry high total suspended matter (TSM) loads with a modest particulate organic C (POC) content, the lake itself and its outflow were characterized by much lower TSM values and a high relative contribution of POC to TSM (% POC). The POC concentration of the outflow (13.0 +/- 7.7 mg L-1) was substantially higher than in the inflowing water (1.9 +/- 2.1 mg L-1), and delta 13C values were also distinct between inflowing water (-24.6 +/- 1.8 parts per thousand) and the lake (-26.5 +/- 2.1 parts per thousand) or its outflow (-25.2 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand). Similarly, the lake outflow was surprisingly rich in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (9.5 +/- 1.4 mg L-1) compared to inflowing water (2.6 +/- 1.1 mg L-1). This indicates that the lake and its surrounding wetlands act as a substantial source of additional organic C which is exported downstream. The CO2 and CH4 concentrations in inflowing and outflowing rivers were substantially higher than in lake waters, and they peaked during the rainy season due to lateral inputs from wetlands. However, sources of POC and DOC were uncoupled: delta 13C data indicated that marsh vegetation was the main source of net DOC inputs, while phytoplankton contributed substantially to POC in the lacustrine waters, at least during parts of the sampling period. Indeed, lake suspended matter has relatively low POC / Chl a ratios (143-564, particularly during the May sampling period), high % POC (10 % to 29 %), and delta 13C values (-26.5 +/- 2.1 parts per thousand) distinct from those in marsh-derived organic matter. Despite the evidence for phytoplankton production as a contributor to the lake POC pool, the lake acted as a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere, likely due to the high C inputs from the surrounding marshes and to sediment respiration (considering the shallow water depth). Nevertheless, the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) levels in the surface waters of the lake were lower than those in the inflowing and outflowing rivers. This reduction is likely due to the combined effects of phytoplankton production, which assimilates CO2 during photosynthesis, and degassing processes. When CO2-supersaturated riverine water enters the open lake, increased turbulence caused by wind fetch enhances gas exchange with the atmosphere, allowing CO2 to escape more readily from the water column. The biogeochemical functioning of Lake Alaotra differs substantially from the large and deeper East African (sub)tropical lakes and is more similar to lakes surrounded by flooded forests in the Congo River basin, likely due to a combination of its large surface area and shallow water depth and the large extent of surrounding wetlands and floodplains. It acts as an abrupt element in the land-ocean continuum of the catchment, whereby the biogeochemical characteristics of the Maningory River (i.e. the lake outflow) are strongly determined by processes taking place in Lake Alaotra and its wetlands, rather than being reflective of characteristics and processes further upstream in the catchment.

The impacts of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) on hydrological processes and water exchange dynamics between these lakes and the Yangtze River were analyzed. Since the TGD began operation in 2003, significant changes in water level fluctuations and their rates of change have reshaped water exchange intensity and ecological balance in the oxbow lakes. A statistical model characterized the probability density distribution of daily water-level change rates, identifying distinct operationdependent shifts, with the most dynamic changes near the 30 m threshold. An empirical threshold regression model incorporating the Langmuir adsorption formula effectively described the nonlinear relationships among water level, water-level change rate, and water exchange flow, providing a reliable predictive tool. Seasonal and interannual variations in water exchange intensity were quantified across three critical intervals: flood preparation (Interval I), peak fish migration (Interval II), and post-flood recession (Interval III). Findings revealed reduced water exchange during Interval II negatively impacted small fish populations, challenging species such as the Yangtze finless porpoise. Increased water exchange during Interval III improved water quality by reducing nutrient concentrations and enhancing dissolved oxygen levels. Regulation strategies using an exponential function demonstrated the potential to optimize water exchange intensity by controlling water level variation rates. The proposed ecological hydrological regulation framework offers a scientific basis for improving water exchange during key biological periods, ensuring habitat quality and supporting biodiversity. These findings highlight the critical role of hydrological regulation in maintaining the ecological health and functions of oxbow lakes.

J	Heath, ACG				Heath, ACG			Distribution, seasonality and relative abundance of Stomoxys calcitrans (stablefly) (Diptera: Muscidae) in New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND VETERINARY JOURNAL												AIMS: To determine the current distribution, seasonality and relative abundance of Stomoxys calcitrans in New Zealand in order to provide information that could be used to assess risks of transmission of equine infectious anaemia (EIA). METHODS: Adhesive yellow traps were distributed to schools throughout New Zealand and used to detect the presence of S. calcitrans between November 1999 and April 2000 at sites considered likely to be a focus for S. calcitrans breeding and activity. In addition, researchers undertook monthly trapping at six other sites between August 1999 and June 2000 to measure the duration and seasonal periodicity of S. calcitrans flight activity. Veterinary practices and farmers were also surveyed to provide anecdotal evidence of the presence or absence of S. calcitrans, particularly in areas where no flies were trapped by schools. RESULTS: Stomoxys calcitrans was found to occur in both North and South Islands, but principally in locations where dairy farming occurred. The fly was active during most months of the year, except perhaps during July and August, and was particularly active in warmer North Island districts such as the Waikato. Peak activity was recorded from January to May. The fly was more abundant in Northland, Auckland, Waikato, the Marlborough Sounds and Nelson than in other districts, as determined by the number of occasions flies were caught relative to the number of traps set. There are only a few areas, such as around Taupo, the Otago Lakes, Central Otago and the Mackenzie Basin, where S. calcitrans was not trapped or, on the basis of anecdotal evidence, thought not to occur. CONCLUSIONS: Given that other potential vectors of EIA, are absent from New Zealand, Taupo, the Otago Lakes, Central Otago and the Mackenzie Basin districts could be considered areas of low risk for EIA transmission to horses. In addition, teachers and school children were capable, in most instances, of supporting a nationwide survey providing the methods were simple and the aims few.																			0048-0169	1176-0710				JUN	2002	50	3					93	98		10.1080/00480169.2002.36289	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00480169.2002.36289								16032218					WOS:000176593300002
J	Smith, KA; Brown, ML				Smith, KA; Brown, ML			Seasonal composition and abundance of ichthyoplankton entrained through Big Bend Dam, South Dakota	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Age-0 fishes were sampled in the tailrace of Big Bend Dam, Missouri River, from June 2 to September 30, 1999. Overall, 6,302 fish representing 11 species were collected, although gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum; 76%) and freshwater drum (Aplodotinus grunniens; 22.6%) composed the majority of the catch. Mean abundances (number of fish/1,000 m SE) of entrained age-0 freshwater drum and gizzard shad were 15.2 +/- 12 and 42.8 +/- 6.8, respectively. Typically, freshwater drum catches were highest at night and gizzard shad catches were highest during the day. Cumulative losses (number of fish +/- 95% CI) of fish from Lake Sharpe resulting from turbine entrainment through Big Bend Dam from June 2 to September 30 were 120 x 10(6) +/- 80 X 10(3) freshwater drum and 447 x 10(6) +/- 390 x 10(3) gizzard shad. Cumulative larval biomass losses were approximately 35 metric tons of gizzard shad and five metric tons of freshwater drum. Average daily losses for the sampling period due to entrainment were estimated to be about 1.0 x 10(6) freshwater drum (41 kg) and 3.7 x 10(6) gizzard shad (270 kg) per day.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				JUN	2002	17	2					199	207		10.1080/02705060.2002.9663888	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2002.9663888													WOS:000175646300005
J	VANDIJK, GM				VANDIJK, GM			DYNAMICS AND ATTENUATION CHARACTERISTICS OF PERIPHYTON UPON ARTIFICIAL SUBSTRATUM UNDER VARIOUS LIGHT CONDITIONS AND SOME ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS ON PERIPHYTON UPON POTAMOGETON-PECTINATUS L	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The seasonal variation in periphyton dynamics has been studied upon artificial substratum (microscopic glass slides) under various light conditions during the periods May-October 1986 and May-September 1987, in Lake Veluwe. Some additional observations on the periphyton development upon leaves of Potamogeton pectinatus L. have been made simultaneously. Four different light conditions were created in an experimental setup by manipulating the photon flux density through artificial shading. Periphyton upon artificial substratum exhibited a relatively high abundance with a distinct seasonal pattern. Periphyton accrual rates were highest at the beginning of June and in August and September upon slides which were incubated for two weeks. Periphyton mass increased during May and June, decreased or remained about the same during July and subsequently increased until an upper plateau was reached upon slides which were incubated from the beginning of May onwards. Generally, periphyton mass was lower upon slides than upon P. pectinatus. The seasonal variation in periphyton mass was more pronounced upon P. pectinatus leaves than upon the slides. Attenuation by periphyton upon slides ranged from 5 to 65% after two weeks of incubation. Periphyton upon slides which had been incubated for more than two weeks demonstrated an attenuation of more than 85%. Water quality parameters other than photon flux density were probably more important in determining the periphyton dynamics, since only minor differences were observed in periphyton mass between the various light conditions. Chlorophyll-a content was higher with increased shading on various sampling dates. Periphyton, especially 'older' periphyton consisted largely of settled silt and clay particles and to a lesser extent of detrital matter on both substrata. Living epiphytes were only a relatively small fraction. It is concluded that a reduction of resuspension of sediment particles, giving less suspended matter in the water column, will result in lower periphytic mass. Consequently, the quantity of photosynthetically active radiation reaching the submerged macrophytes is expected to increase considerably.																			0018-8158					FEB 19	1993	252	2					143	161		10.1007/BF00008152	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008152													WOS:A1993KY41900003

Sex ratio, breeding season, length at first maturity and fecundity of L. horie were studied from 1197 fish samples collected between August 1998 and October 1999 in Lake Chamo, Ethiopia. The sex ratio was significantly different (chi(2) = 12.12, P < 0.001). The peak-breeding period was during the rainy months of March to May, during which time more than 90% of both sexes had ripe gonads. The size at maturity (L (m50)) of males was 52 cm while the L-m50 of females was 62 cm. The smallest ripe male in the catch was 46.7 cm and weighed 890 g while the smallest ripe female caught was 49.5 cm and weighed 1145 g. The weight of ripe ovaries ranged from 54.3 g to 991.8 g and contained between 68,400 and 1,320,400 eggs. Relative fecundity ranged between 60 and 290 eggs per g of body weight. The relationships between fecundity and total length and between fecundity and total weight were curvilinear, while the relationship between fecundity and ovary weight was linear. L. horie conformed to the general pattern of reproduction in a tropical environment where peak-breeding activity occurred during the rainy season. In order to protect the spawning population, fishing pressure should be minimized during breeding time at the shallower littoral regions.

The observations spanned the growing season (late May to mid-September 1994) and extended the fluxes obtained in two intensive study areas to larger spatial scales to help provide a data set that is useful for comparison with and validation of large-scale models and satellite retrievals. We found the deciduous forests to be more photosynthetically active than nearby coniferous forests. Coniferous forest fluxes across the transect from the BOREAS southern to northern study areas show no apparent spatial trend, though smaller-scale variability is large. The fluxes make a smooth transition from the BOREAS northern study area to the subarctic tundra. Typical midsummer, midday, large-scale net ecosystem exchanges of carbon dioxide were about -10 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for primarily deciduous forests, about -6 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for the primarily coniferous regions between and including the two BOREAS study areas, and about -2 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for the subarctic tundra. The first two values are similar to those observed by flux towers in the region. Throughout the boreal forest the fluxes are influenced by the presence of lakes. Lake fraction is found to be a dominant source of variability in the fluxes observed along the transect. Lakes are also found to be large sinks of available radiant energy. Regional ground storage of heat is estimated to be about 30% of the net radiation over the forest, and 40% over the subarctic tundra, largely due to the presence of lakes.

The pristine condition of the area offers an ideal environment for assessing geochemical processes, and the seasonal cycles to which the basin is subjected permit us to study seasonal variations that are mainly influenced by glacial pulses. The most remarkable characteristics observed in the REE-normalized patterns are a strong HREE enrichment and a positive Eu anomaly. These normalized patterns are atypical as compared to those considered representative of the world's major rivers and are caused by drainage basin geology. Due to the dissected topography and the small size of the basin, intense mixing phenomena are not favoured and the weathering reactions are inhibited by the fast-flowing river. These physicochemical conditions and near-neutral pH values have an important influence on the REE patterns of the sediments, which mainly originated by glacial erosion, that are transported by the river. The feldspars and their secondary products, which are both enriched in Eu, might be the cause of the Eu anomaly. HREE enrichment, which is mainly associated with high-pH systems or with the presence of accessory phases, shows a clear dependence on source rocks. The calculated (La/Yb)(N) ratios oscillate between 0.5 and 0.6, contrasting with the values reported in the literature as average values for suspended load material. Nevertheless, these values are consistent with the dependence of (La/Yb)(N) values on the age of drainage area rocks as was observed by Goldstein and Jacobsen [3]. Seasonal variations are not manifested in REE concentrations, and additional elemental determinations showed coherent behaviour during weathering for all elements except Sr and Ba, which exhibited selective elemental mobilization during periods of minimum discharge.

The shorefront of the lake is exposed to a high rate of littoral drift, one million cubic metre per year. A One year study showed the migration of the inlet mouth to approximately 500 m northward. The Bow of salt water from the sea into the lake as well as into the Chilka Lake eco-system is severely limited by conditions as follows: reduced inlet cross section associated with lengthening of the inlet channel; extremely low tidal prism as compared to the volume of water in the lake; and the significant fresh water discharge into the lake during the monsoon season. The stability criteria based on the ratio of tidal prism and the annual littoral drift shows that the tidal inlet is hydraulically very poor. An artificial opening of a channel about 480 m in width dredged to a depth of 10 m is suggested in the paper to increase the tidal prism to about 1.5 x 10(3) m(3). This will considerably improve the water exchange between the sea and the lake to maintain the lake eco-system.																			0749-0208					FAL	1994	10	4					909	918																WOS:A1994PJ19000009

We explored perceptions of fishers and Fisheries Officers regarding a first-ever fishing ban on Lake Tanganyika, Zambia. Opinions were collected from 184 fishers and 16 Fisheries Officers using structured and semi-structured questionnaires. Fishers' livelihoods and social well-being were significantly disrupted, with 92.5% reporting income loss, 77.5% facing unemployment, and 68.8% suffering economic hardship. Hunger (37.5%), divorce (37.5%), and theft (25.0%) were also reported. In response, many fishers adopted coping strategies such as farming (45%), trading (40%), and brick-molding (30%). Fisheries Officers identified key implementation challenges, notably illegal fishing (87.5%), resistance from fishers (81.3%), and untimely funding (68.8%), but they also noted opportunities such as promoting sustainable fishing (93.8%) and enhancing platforms for extension services (62.5%). Alternative fishing areas did not significantly influence support for the ban, whereas having alternative income sources reduced the likelihood of support for the ban. Support for the ban was significantly associated with perceived positive opportunities and education level. We conclude that fishing bans can enhance sustainability, but their success depends on providing alternative livelihoods for fishers and timely institutional support. Further research is needed on the effects of fishing bans on other stakeholders, like traders, transporters, and processors.

Marufuku ya uvuvi hutumika sana kama zana za usimamizi wa uvuvi, lakini athari zake kwa jamii za wavuvi walio katika mazingira magumu bado hazieleweki vizuri. Utafiti huu ulichunguza maoni ya wavuvi na Maafisa wa Uvuvi kuhusu marufuku ya kwanza kabisa ya uvuvi katika Ziwa Tanganyika, Zambia. Maoni yalikusanywa kutoka kwa wavuvi 184 na Maafisa wa Uvuvi 16 kwa kutumia maswali ya muundo na ya nusu-muundo. Maisha ya wavuvi na ustawi wao wa kijamii vilitatizika kwa kiasi kikubwa, ambapo 92.5% waliripoti kupoteza kipato, 77.5% walikumbana na ukosefu wa ajira, na 68.8% walikumbwa na shida za kiuchumi. Njaa (37.5%), talaka (37.5%), na wizi (25.0%) pia viliripotiwa. Katika kukabiliana na hali hiyo, wavuvi wengi walichukua mikakati kama vile kilimo (45%), biashara (40%), na utengenezaji wa matofali (30%). Maafisa wa Uvuvi walibaini changamoto kuu za utekelezaji ikiwa ni pamoja na uvuvi haramu (87.5%), upinzani kutoka kwa wavuvi (81.3%), na ufadhili usio wa wakati muafaka (68.8%), lakini pia waliona fursa kama kukuza uvuvi endelevu (93.8%) na kuboresha majukwaa ya huduma za ugani (62.5%). Maeneo mbadala ya uvuvi hayakuwa na athari kubwa kwa uungwaji mkono wa marufuku, wakati uwepo wa vyanzo mbadala vya kipato ulipunguza uwezekano wa kuunga mkono marufuku hiyo. Uungwaji mkono wa marufuku ya uvuvi ulihusishwa sana na fursa chanya zinazotambulika na kiwango cha elimu. Tunazitisha kwamba marufuku ya uvuvi inaweza kusaidia kuendeleza uvuvi endelevu, lakini mafanikio yake yanategemea kuwepo kwa njia mbadala za kujikimu kwa wavuvi na msaada wa taasisi kwa wakati. Tafiti zaidi zinahitajika ili kuchunguza athari za marufuku ya uvuvi kwa wadau wengine kama wafanyabiashara, wasafirishaji na wasindikaji.

Simulated diel cycles demonstrated large changes in the ambient concentration of dissolved CO2 and parallel changes in CA activity. The CA activity depended on the total concentrations of inorganic carbon (C-i) and in particular on the dissolved CO2. Lowering the C-i concentrations resulted in a large increase in CA activity within several hours. Light and photosynthesis were both required for the induction of CA activity. Under CO2-limited conditions, the dependence of the photosynthetic rate on CA (estimated from the ratio of photosynthetic rates in the presence or absence oS CA inhibitors) was greater in P. gatunense than in other eukaryotic microalgae. This points to the ecological significance of CA in photosynthetic carbon uptake mechanisms of a Large, dominant alga in a natural ecosystem.

J	OWENS, M; CORNWELL, JC				OWENS, M; CORNWELL, JC			SEDIMENTARY EVIDENCE FOR DECREASED HEAVY-METAL INPUTS TO THE CHESAPEAKE BAY	AMBIO												The recent history of trace-metal input to Chesapeake Bay was examined using Pb-210-dated sediment cores. Published studies from cores collected in the 1970s showed that the highest trace-metal concentrations were found in sediment horizons near the sediment-water interface, suggesting a continuing increase in metal inputs. The goal of this study was to determine whether two decades of environmental regulation have made a difference in the amount of trace metal deposited in Chesapeake Bay. Two sites were chosen where seasonal anoxia minimized the activities of bioturbating organisms and the cores were analyzed for cobalt, copper, iron, lead, manganese, nickel, and zinc. Profiles for Cu, Pb and Zn show increases in metal concentrations from the beginning of the century to the early 1970s, and a decrease in more recent years, This study shows that significant progress has been made in decreasing trace-metal contamination in the mainstem Chesapeake Bay.

However, not many studies providing insight on context-specific risk factors have been published. The purpose of this study was to describe the recent cholera outbreaks in Cameroon and to determine factors associated with mortality. Methods This was an analytical cross-sectional study that employed a retrospective design exploiting Ministry of Public Health cholera line-lists from 2018-2023. These line lists were obtained from the Public Health Emergency Operations Coordination and Control Center, compiled into a single Microsoft Excel Sheet, cleaned and analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2016 and SPSS version 20. Cholera cases were defined as those confirmed in reference laboratories via stool culture and suspected cases with proven epidemiological link to laboratory-confirmed cases (suspected cases in health districts with active laboratory-confirmed cases). Factors associated with cholera mortality were identified using binary logistic regression (adjusted odds ratios), after socio-demographic, clinical, and geographical distribution of cholera cases were described. Maps were generated using QGIS version 3.28.14. Results Between May 2018 and March 2023, Cameroon experienced four cholera epidemics resulting in 18,986 reported cases and affecting 8 out of 10 administrative regions. The three coastal regions (Littoral, South and South-West Region) reported 83.4% (15,839/18,986) of all the cases while the remaining five affected regions jointly reported 16.6% (3,147/18,986) cases. The most represented age group were those aged 25-35 years (21.9%; 4,163/1,876) and the male: female sex ratio was 1.27. The overall CFR was 2.7% (478 deaths/17,967 cases with known outcome) and was highest among persons > 65 years (6.8%; 59/869). Urban areas notified more cases than rural areas (13,267 vs 5,484). Factors associated with increased mortality were male sex (aOR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.30-2.04), dry season (aOR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.28-2.22), age above 45 years (aOR 1.79, 95% CI: 1.45-2.22) and severe dehydration at consultation (aOR 12.76, 95% CI: 7.66-21.25). Conclusions Cholera outbreaks occurred in eight out of the ten administrative regions in Cameroon during the study period and mortality appeared to be driven by multiple factors notably severe dehydration at time of consultation, advanced age, male sex and the dry season. The high caseloads and case-fatality rates reiterate the need for further strengthening of existing cholera surveillance and outbreak response mechanisms.																				1471-2458				MAY 16	2025	25	1							1816	10.1186/s12889-025-23007-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-025-23007-5								40380135					WOS:001489924200014

There were significant differences between moisture and lipid contents, although there were no statistically significant differences between crude protein and ash contents. The mineral and trace elements determined were Na, K, Ca, P, Mg, Zn, Cu, Fe, Pb and Se. Although Na and Fe contents of zanders in two different lakes were different from each other (P < 0.01), we found no statistically significant differences in terms of Mg, Ca, P, Cu, Pb, Se, Zn contents (P > 0.01). Among the minerals analyzed, K was the highest followed by P, Ca, Na and Mg.

J	Yamamoto, T; Edo, K				Yamamoto, Toshiaki; Edo, Kaneaki			Factors influencing the breeding activity in male masu salmon, Oncorhynchus masou:: The relationship with body size	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Male body size has been emphasized as an important factor contributing to the breeding success of individuals. However, the operational sex ratio (OSR: ratio of mature females to males) during the breeding season significantly change due to differences in the breeding timing and period within and between males and females and may influence the selective advantage of the male large body size for mates. We examined the reproductive ecology of masu salmon Oncorhynchus masou, inhabiting Lake Toya, Hokkaido, northern Japan. Precipitation triggered the upstream migration, although males migrated into the river earlier than females. As a result, the OSR in the river changed markedly during the breeding season, as did the size structure of males in the river. Large males migrated into the river earlier than the smaller males. Differential male survival resulted in the different population size structure between the early and late periods. Under these conditions, we analyzed which males were more successful in releasing the more sperm throughout the breeding season by estimating the decrease in the sperm content in male carcasses. The body size and sperm-releasing success of the males were not related. With a weak male-biased OSR and synchronous timing of reproduction in females, males that had entered the river succeeded in releasing the sperm regardless of body size. Such a fluctuating advantage for different body sizes likely contributes to the maintenance of the size variation in the male salmon.					; Edo, KANEAKI/N-9011-2019	Edo, Kaneaki/0009-0008-8168-8738; 													0378-1909	1573-5133				APR	2006	75	4					375	383		10.1007/s10641-005-3039-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-005-3039-1													WOS:000238741000002

This study aims to conduct an in-depth investigation into the hydrochemical characteristics and their controlling factors during the dry season of the Hengshui Lake wetland system. By collecting water samples from the lake and shallow groundwater, and using water chemistry diagrams, ion ratios, mineral saturation indices, and multivariate statistical methods, the study systematically analyzes the hydrochemical characteristics of Hengshui Lake Wetland and its controlling factors. The results show: there is significant stratified differentiation in the water chemical composition: the lake water is weakly alkaline and fresh, while the shallow groundwater is highly mineralized and saline. Both are dominated by Na+, Mg2+, SO42-, and Cl-. Significant differences exist in water chemistry types between the lake and shallow groundwater. The lake water exhibits homogenized characteristics with a dominant SO4<middle dot>Cl<middle dot>HCO3-Na<middle dot>Mg type, whereas shallow groundwater displays five distinct hydrochemical facies indicative of multi-source recharge processes. Evaporation-rock interaction mechanisms dominate the system, as evidenced by a Gibbs diagram analysis showing evaporation crystallization as the primary control. Ion ratio calculations demonstrate synergistic effects between silicate weathering and evaporite dissolution, while mineral saturation indices confirm cooperative processes involving calcite/dolomite oversaturation and ongoing gypsum dissolution. Cation exchange indexes combined with chloro-alkaline indices reveal unidirectional recharge from lake water to shallow groundwater accompanied by active cationic exchange adsorption. Although the wetland predominantly maintains natural hydrological conditions, elevated gamma(NO3-)/gamma(Na+) ratios in nearshore zones suggest initial agricultural contamination infiltration. This study shows that, as a typical example of a closed wetland, the hydrochemistry evolution of Hengshui Lake during the dry season is primarily dominated by the coupled effects of evaporation and rock-water interaction, with silicate weathering and evaporation rock dissolution as secondary factors, and human activity having a weak influence. The findings provide new insights into the understanding of the hydrochemical evolution process and its controlling factors in closed lakes, offering valuable data support and theoretical basis for the ecological restoration and sustainable management of closed lakes.

The study aimed to evaluate vegetable yield and nitrogen loss under these fertilization methods to understand their influence on soil nitrogen balance. This experiment focused on a lettuce-cabbage cropping system and utilized five treatment groups: no fertilizer, organic fertilizer (OM), chemical fertilizer combined with organic fertilizer (NPK + OM), chemical fertilizer with added nitrogen (NPK + OM + N), and chemical fertilizer with added phosphorus (NPK + OM + P). The results indicated that the OM treatment significantly enhanced yield by 32.6% in the lettuce growing season and 15.9% during the cabbage growing season compared to the NPK + OM treatment. It also improved nitrogen use efficiencies and reduced nitrogen losses more effectively. Specifically, cumulative N2O emissions decreased by 63.7% and 82.1% during the lettuce and cabbage growing seasons, respectively, under OM treatment. Similarly, NH3 emissions were reduced by 95.5% and 95.0% across the two seasons. The OM treatment notably decreased total nitrogen (TN) and nitrate (NO3--N) runoff losses. Conversely, the NPK + OM + N treatment lowered nitrogen use efficiencies and increased nitrogen losses, including a significant rise in N2O and NH3 emissions during the crop-growing periods. Compared to this treatment, the OM treatment drastically cut cumulative N2O emissions by 89.8% and 92.3% and NH3 emissions by 98.7% and 98.2% across the lettuce and cabbage growing seasons, respectively. In terms of nitrogen balance, aside from the significantly higher values observed in the NPK + OM + N treatment, no notable differences were seen among the other treatments. During the lettuce growing season, nitrogen output was significantly lower in the OM treatment, with the majority found in the aboveground plant parts (approximately 81%). In contrast, in the NPK + OM, NPK + OM + N, and NPK + OM + P treatments, significant nitrogen losses occurred via other pathways, constituting about 61%-66% of total losses. During the cabbage season, aboveground plant parts accounted for the majority of nitrogen output, with 98.2% in the OM treatment and 94%-96% in the other chemical fertilizer treatments. The sole application of organic fertilizer can reduce nitrogen losses while maintaining yield, ensuring economic and environmental benefits.

Multiple modes of shoreline change along the Alaskan Beaufort Sea observed using ICESat-2 altimetry and satellite imagery	CRYOSPHERE												Arctic shorelines are retreating rapidly due to declining sea ice cover, increasing temperatures, and increasing storm activity. Shoreline morphology may influence local retreat rates, but quantifying this relationship requires repeat estimates of shoreline positions and morphologic properties. Here we use a novel combination of shoreline boundaries from multispectral imagery from Planet and topographic profiles from the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2) altimeter to compare year-to-year changes in shoreline position and morphology across different shoreline types, focusing on an 8 km stretch of the Alaskan Beaufort Sea coast during the 2019-2021 open-water seasons. We consider temporal and spatial variability in shoreline change in the context of environmental forcings from ERA5 and morphologic classifications from the ShoreZone database. We find a mean spatially averaged shoreline change rate of -16.5 m a-1 over 3 years, with local estimates ranging from -66.7 to +18.6 m in a single year. We posit that annual and kilometer-scale variability in shoreline change can be explained by the response of different geomorphic units to time-varying wave and ocean conditions. Ice-rich coastal bluffs and inundated tundra exhibited high retreat that is likely driven by high temperatures and wave exposure, while the stretch of shoreline with vegetated peat in front of a large breached thermokarst lake remained relatively stable. Our topographic profiles from ICESat-2 sample three distinct shoreline types (a bluff, a small drained lake basin, and a dune in front of a large drained lake basin) that exhibit different patterns of shoreline change (in terms of both position and morphology) over the 3-year study period. Analysis of altimetry-derived morphologic parameters such as elevation and slope and small-scale features such as toppled blocks and surface ponding provide insight into specific erosion and accretion processes that drive shoreline change. We conclude that repeat altimetry measurements from ICESat-2 and multispectral imagery provide complementary observations that illustrate how both the position and the topography of the shoreline are changing in response to a changing Arctic.

J	Knopp, PD				Knopp, Peter D.			The Distribution of Quercus rubra in the Maumee Lake Plain of Southeastern Michigan	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.) has been described as an opportunistic, pioneer species adapted to mesic sites, though its presence and site-specific occurrence in extreme soil-water conditions is not well understood. Fifty woodlots were investigated for the presence of Q. rubra on the Maumee lake plain of southeastern Michigan. Although it was found widespread geographically, Quercus rubra was observed only in dry-mesic to mesic ecosystems where adequate moisture remains throughout the growing season on sand, sand/clay, and clay lake plain landforms. Quercus rubra was absent in sand lake plain ecosystems of nutrient-poor, deep sand (> 200 cm to clay), and from high sand ridges that were not adjacent to swampy depressions. Within the sand lake plain it was observed only on relatively mesic, well- to somewhat poorly-drained ecosystems. In all landforms, Q. rubra was absent in seasonally inundated depressions. Successful overstory recruitment of Q. rubra was very rare, with the exception of a single site on the sand lake plain. Lacking major disturbances in the overstory, Q. rubra will likely be replaced by basswood (Tilia americana L.) and elm (Ulmus spp.) on the clay lake plain, sugar (Acer saccharum Marsh.), and black maple (Acer nigrum Michx. f.) on the sand/clay lake plain, and red maple (Acer rubrum L.), black cherry (Prunus serotina Ehrh.), and sugar maple on the sand lake plain. Further studies with a particular focus on water-table relations are necessary to predict future migrations of Q. rubra under a warming climate.																			0003-0031	1938-4238				JUL	2012	168	1					70	92																WOS:000305921800007
J	Rwetabula, J; De Smedt, F; Rebhun, M				Rwetabula, Justus; De Smedt, Florimond; Rebhun, Menahem			Simulation of hydrological processes in the Simiyu River, tributary of Lake Victoria, Tanzania	WATER SA												A spatially-distributed hydrologic model (WetSpa) is used to simulate hydrologic processes in the Simiyu River, a tributary of Lake Victoria, Tanzania. The model combines digital maps of topography, land-use and soil texture with observed daily meteorological time series to predict discharge hydrographs and spatial distribution of hydrologic parameters in the basin. The model was calibrated using 3 years of daily observed discharge measured at the mouth of the river at Lake Victoria. The estimated average travel time of the runoff to the outlet of the basin is about 2.4 days and a maximum of 8 days for the most remote areas. The model results show that the surface runoff and interflow provide, respectively, 38.6% and 61.4% of the total discharge, while the contribution of groundwater drainage is about nil. The absence of groundwater drainage is likely due to the high evaporative demand of the atmosphere, which accounts for about 90% of the total precipitation being lost by evapotranspiration. The annual water balance estimated with the model reveals that the total outflow to Lake Victoria is about 475 x 10(6) m(3) per year, which occurs mainly in the wet seasons, i.e. from March to May and from November to January. The discharge volume produced by agricultural land amounts to about 43 x 10(6) m(3) and may carry agrochemicals to Lake Victoria.

Climate change and underwater light: Large-scale changes in ultraviolet radiation transparency associated with intensifying wet-dry cycles	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS												Ultraviolet radiation (UV) is the most energetic waveband of incident solar radiation and has wide-ranging effects in the aquatic environment. Our analysis of an 18-year record of underwater irradiance and related limnological variables in sub-alpine, ultra-oligotrophic Lake Tahoe revealed orders of magnitude changes in UV transparency associated with interannual climate perturbations. The large-scale shifts between years were caused by pronounced changes in the loading of allochthonous particulate matter and colored dissolved organic matter associated with regional dry-wet cycles, while autochthonous factors explained the seasonal variations in UV under average weather conditions. Water clarity in the photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) waveband showed less variation, resulting in large interannual differences in the UV : PAR ratio. Clearwater lakes are likely to experience increasingly large fluctuations in underwater UV and spectral irradiance due to ongoing climate change and precipitation extremes, with potential impacts on their ecosystem structure and function.

J	Elbaz-Poulichet, F; Nagy, A; Cserny, T				Elbaz-Poulichet, Francoise; Nagy, Attila; Cserny, Tibor			The Distribution of Redox Sensitive Elements (U, As, Sb, V and Mo) along a River-Wetland-Lake System (Balaton Region, Hungary)	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The distribution of redox sensitive elements (U, As, Sb, Mo and V) has been investigated in Lake Balaton and two man-made reservoirs (Lake Kis-Balaton-1 and Kis-Balaton-2) built along the River Zala, the main river discharging into it. These elements underwent removal in Lake Kis Balaton-2 (KB-2) during anoxic conditions (May and September). Similarities were found between the distributions of dissolved As and Sb. Both elements had elevated dissolved concentrations in Lake Kis-Balaton-1 (KB-1) and in Lake Balaton in September. This increased mobility could be due to a change of speciation (via reduction and the formation of methylated species). Such changes in speciation are well documented in the literature and are generally enhanced during periods of warmth and high primary productivity. Dissolved V and Mo distributions also showed similarities with higher concentrations in Lake Balaton than in other parts of the system. Although removal is not clearly detected from the dissolved concentrations, U, As, Sb and Mo are significantly enriched in the organic-rich sediments of Lake KB-1, while V is mainly associated with the alumino-silicate fraction. In Lake KB-1, the concentrations of all elements in SPM (suspended particulate matter) are lower than in the deposited sediments (except for As) suggesting that enrichment processes are occuring in the deposited sediments. Additionnally the cycling of As and Mo can be also partly controlled by uptake and scavenging processes in the water column, as suggested by the elevated As and Mo concentrations observed in SPM seasonnally for As in Lake KB-1 and at Z. mouth-1 station and for Mo at Z. mouth-1 station and Lake Balaton.					elbaz-poulichet, Francoise/Q-7411-2019; Elbaz-Poulichet, Francoise/C-8047-2019	Elbaz-Poulichet, Francoise/0000-0003-2568-7681													1380-6165	1573-1421				SEP	1997	3	3					267	282		10.1023/A:1009616214030	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1009616214030													WOS:000209214400004

For this purpose, daily water balances were applied to reconstruct the water level. Model results were validated using actual water level monitoring over the past 20 years. We surveyed post-Pliocene geological structures in the endorheic watershed to investigate lake nucleation and to improve the hydrogeological model. Additionally, we investigated the groundwater level evolution in nearby aquifers, which have been profusely affected by groundwater exploitation for domestic and agricultural use. Then, the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 climate change scenarios were applied to forecast the future of this lake system. We found that the playa-lake hydroperiod will shorten, causing the system to shift from seasonal to ephemeral, which appears to be a general trend in this area. However, the impact on the La Ratosa-Herriza de los Ladrones system would be likely more severe due to local stressors, such as groundwater withdrawal for urban demand and agriculture, driving the system to complete desiccation for extended periods. These results highlight the sensitivity of these protected ecosystems to changes in the watershed's water balance and underscore the urgent need to preserve watersheds from any form of water use, other than ecological purposes. This approach aims to support informed decision-making to mitigate adverse impacts on these fragile ecosystems, ensuring their ecological integrity in the context of climate change and increasing water demand for various uses.

This study evaluates the two-year effects (2020-2022) of connectivity interventions on seven lakes in Yangshuo, Guilin, classified by connectivity: multi-channel (Mc), single-channel (Sc), and non-connected (Nc). Regular monitoring of the physicochemical parameters and microbial communities revealed significant patterns: multi-channel connected lakes exhibited superior water quality improvement, with trophic state downgrading (weak eutrophic -> mesotrophic), but the water quality of Sc-BQ was deteriorating. Seasonal variations showed wet season peaks in pH, DO, CODMn, and Chl-a, versus dry season elevations in NH3-N, NO3-N, TN, and TP. Correlation analysis identified organic matter as the primary driver of eutrophication, with TN strongly linked to NH3-N, indicating persistent domestic sewage contamination. Microbial community restructuring was accompanied by changes in water quality, and the abundance and diversity of OTUs decreased after restoration. Notably, Limnohabitans dominated Mc lakes (31.82-35.1%), while Pleurocapsa prevailed (37.85%) in Nc-LH under weak eutrophic conditions. These findings demonstrate that multi-channel connectivity effectively enhances hydrodynamic conditions and pollutant dispersion, whereas inadequate connectivity exacerbates nutrient accumulation. The study provides critical empirical evidence for optimizing urban lake management, emphasizing the necessity of multi-dimensional connectivity designs and targeted control of untreated sewage inputs in water system rehabilitation projects.					he, guangyan/AAS-2858-2020															2073-4441				MAY 7	2025	17	9							1398	10.3390/w17091398	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17091398													WOS:001486031100001

Fire suppression has altered the structure and composition of these communities. The effects of environmental variation and the recent reintroduction of fire on plant distribution and abundance across this landscape were investigated. Relative cover of herbaceous and woody ground cover species and density of sapling and canopy trees along with elevation, percent bare ground, percent canopy cover, and litter depth were determined in burned and long-unburned treatments for all community types. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) identified elevation and time since fire as the most influential environmental variables for species distribution and abundance. Species most closely associated with lower sites included Gaylussacia mosieri Small, Ilex glabra (L.) Gray, Kalmia hirsuta Wait., Magnolia virginiana L., Pinus palustrus P. Mill., Vaccinium myrsinites Lam., Aristida L. species, and Calamovilfa curtissii (Vasey) Schribrin.. Species associated most closely with higher sites included Ilex vomitoria Ait., Quercus chapmanii Sarg., Quercus geminata Small, Quercus myrtifolia Willd., Vaccinium stamineum L., Baptisia lanceolata (Walt.) Ell., Cladonia Hill ex P. Browne species, Eriogonum tomentosum Michx., Rhynchospora megalocarpa Gray, and Yucca filamentosa L. Eight months post fire, burned sites had lower density of woody overstory and saplings compared to long-unburned sites. Herbaceous species richness did not differ between burned and long-unburned sites. Repeated prescribed fires during the growing season and direct seeding may be needed to promote flowering and establishment of additional herbaceous species.																			0885-8608	2162-4399				OCT	2007	27	4					332	344		10.3375/0885-8608(2007)27[332:EOROFI]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3375/0885-8608(2007)27[332:EOROFI]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000250291700006

The reservoirs of Jurumirim, Chavantes, Salto Grande, Canoas 11, Canoas 1, Capivara, Taquarucu and Rosana were built during the last five decades with the purpose of hydroelectric generation. The sampling points were distributed along a 700 km of river stretch in 19 stations distributed in the river-reservoirs zones and main tributaries as well as in 5 stations representing the adjacent wetlands. The nutrient concentration was determined in samples from surface layers of sediment. Temporal and spatial changes were observed for both years. Three different areas could be identified along the river, considering not only Tot-P variations but also others physical and chemical characteristics such as organic matter concentration, nitrogen concentration of sediment and 02, pH, conductivity and Eh measured in the bottom layer of the water column. Higher values of Tot-P were found in the middle and lower region of the Paranapanema basin (maximum value of 1.96 mg g(-1) in Tibagi River in October/2001). Agricultural practices and cattle raising are the main external sources of nutrient in these regions. Superficial or sub-superficial watershed drainage and tributaries entrances are important nutrient contributors, leading to an increasing accumulation of nutrient in the sediment. This process seems to be especially important in the middle region of the Paranapanema Valley, were the values of Tot-P were higher comparing to the other areas.

A total of 6 species of helminth parasites were found on 51 of 105 fish examined. The following parasites were found: Gyrodactylus medius, Asymphylodora tincae, Caryophyllaeus laticeps, plerocercoids of Ligula intestinalis, Proteocephalus torulosus and Bothriocephalus acheilognathi. Asymphylodora tincae was the most common parasite species found in tench with infected fish collected in all months sampled. Infection levels peaked in December (42.8%). Infection levels of the second most commonly found parasite C. laticeps, peaked in April (42.8%). Ligula intestinalis, the third most common parasite was more prevalent in October (20%). The fourth most common parasite P. torulosus was found only in June (27.2%). The fifth most common parasite G. medius was found only in January. The remaining parasite, B. acheilognathi was only present in small numbers with a total of 5 individuals being collected from the intestine. Proteocephalus torulosus is a new record for freshwater fishes in Turkey. Caryophyllaeus laticeps was recorded for the first time in tench in Turkey.

They have been physically and chemically characterized on a particle specific basis using new technology from the biomedical sciences which enables minimization of artefacts of particle sizing and optimization of the microscopical parameters for chemically quantifying their elemental composition by STEM/EDS. The Fe-rich particles have also been macroscopically analysed using classical techniques. The Fe particle size range lies between 0.4 and 0.04 .mu.m, the latter limit being determined by experimental conditions. Particles larger than 0.4 .mu.m have also been observed but are loose aggregates of smaller Fe-rich particles. Chemically, the predominant particle type contains Fe, P and Ca exclusively, although occasional associations of the latter elements with Si or Si/Al occur. The former three elements are strongly correlated, and the mean molar ratios in the particles are 0.25, 0.19 and 1.34 for P/Fe, Ca/Fe and P/Ca, respectively. The Fe is approximately 50% Fe(II) and the P is present as phosphate. Although a good correlation exists between Al and Si, neither is significantly correlated to Fe, P or Ca. The chemical composition is relatively constant spatially seasonally and yearly. These results indicate that a well-defined chemical entity is formed at the redox interface in the water column, composed mostly of Fe(III), Fe(II), PO4 and Ca (and probably OH-).																			0016-7037	1872-9533				FEB	1989	53	2					399	408		10.1016/0016-7037(89)90391-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(89)90391-8													WOS:A1989T469800018

Climate change and shallow aquifers - Unravelling local hydrogeological impacts and groundwater decline-induced subsidence	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Climate change significantly compromises global water resources, particularly shallow aquifer systems, which are vulnerable to variations in precipitation and evapotranspiration. This study investigated the impacts of climate change on a shallow aquifer system in the Gniezno Lakeland, Poland, by analysing the relationship among ground motion, hydraulic head changes, surface water variations, and meteorological trends. We used EGMS-based InSAR ground motion products to detect subtle land surface displacements across the study area, combined with hydrogeological data, meteorological records, and surface water measurements. Our results revealed a slight but ongoing subsidence of -0.9 mm/year across the area, with variations observed across different land cover types and wetlands being the most affected. Seasonal oscillations in hydraulic head (8-50 cm) and ground motion (2-7 mm) highlighted the aquifer's elastic response to climate variability. Long-term meteorological data indicated a trend towards a drier climate, with annual increases in temperature (+0.5 degrees C), insolation (+6.8 h), and evaporation (+3.8 mm), coupled with decreasing humidity (-0.13 %/year). The annual negative vertical water exchange, exceeding the volume of groundwater extraction, suggests that climate-driven factors are the primary drivers of aquifer storage decline. The aquifer system exhibited greater resilience to climate change than surface water, as evidenced by its annual storage change (similar to 2 % of lake volume fluctuations). Localized subsidence patterns near the lake shoreline further underscored the interplay between surface water and groundwater in this region. Our findings provide insights into the impacts of climate change on shallow aquifer systems and highlight the importance of integrating multisource data for comprehensive hydrogeological assessments.

R.			National Nutrient Contribution Dynamics in New Zealand Rivers	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												River water quality degradation poses significant challenges for catchment nutrient management. Effective catchment-scale nutrient management requires a clear understanding of how different contaminants are transported along different flowpaths. Here we investigated nutrient transport pathways and their relative contributions for two prevalent contaminants (total phosphorus: TP; and nitrate-nitrite nitrogen: NNN) at 58 river water quality sites across New Zealand, by applying the Bayesian, chemistry-assisted hydrograph separation approach, in which river flow is partitioned into three components: near-surface event flow (fast flow), seasonal shallow groundwater discharge (medium flow) and long-term groundwater discharge (slow flow). After excluding 15 sites that were impacted by dam/lake outflows or model convergence, results from 43 sites revealed that on an annual basis, medium flow contributes over 50% of annual streamflow at 19 sites and fast flow contribution exceeds 50% at 9 sites. Regarding TP load, TP is primarily transported via fast flow (26 sites), followed by medium flow (14 sites). Concerning NNN loads, most NNN originates from medium flow (25 sites). Correlation analysis with upstream catchment characteristics indicated that annual flow is most highly correlated with precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, followed by geomorphologic factors (e.g., slope) and livestock density, whereas TP loads are most strongly correlated with the number of days with high rainfall, catchment elevation and dairy cow density, and NNN loads are most correlated with annual temperature, geomorphology and geology factors (e.g., slope), as well as land cover (e.g., pastoral) and livestock density which serve as sources of NNN. These findings provide valuable insights for both surface and subsurface transport pathways in New Zealand. The approach offers a practical framework for similar assessments in other regions, to mitigate water quality degradation.					; Woodward, Simon/AAV-1935-2020	Woodward, Simon/0000-0002-3870-3233; Oluwunmi, Paul/0000-0002-9287-5511													0885-6087	1099-1085				MAY	2025	39	5							e70161	10.1002/hyp.70161	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.70161													WOS:001493510700001

There is a scarcity of field in situ observational data on greenhouse gas emissions during the growing season for alpine wetlands, especially for alpine river source wetlands, which limits our understanding of the ability of alpine wetland ecosystems to convert between carbon sources and carbon sinks and also hinders our comprehension of the primary effects of extreme precipitation events on wetland ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the main greenhouse gas emission fluxes in two consecutive growing seasons (May to September) under the conditions of natural control (CK), 75% increase in precipitation (IP), and 75% decrease in precipitation (DP) through in situ field simulations of extreme precipitation in an alpine source wetland in the Qinghai Lake Basin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The results indicate the following: (1) The extreme precipitation increase (IP) treatment did not significantly increase CO2 fluxes; it promoted CH4 flux emissions by 168.2% and N2O flux emissions by 178.4% over the two growing seasons. The extreme precipitation decrease treatment had a non-significant impact on CO2 fluxes; it inhibited CH4 emission fluxes by 96.8% and promoted N2O emission fluxes by 137.8%. (2) During the growing season, CO2 fluxes were 2.2% lower in the IP treatment than in the DP treatment under the two precipitation patterns; the CH4 flux under the IP treatment is 84.1% higher than that under the DP treatment, and N2O fluxes were 43.8% lower in the IP treatment than in the DP treatment. CH4 fluxes were the most sensitive to precipitation changes. (3) The extreme changes in precipitation were not the main influencing factor for CO2 fluxes, while CH4 fluxes were primarily affected by precipitation changes. (4) During the entire growing season, IP reduced the global warming potential (GWP) by 9.03%, and DP decreased GWP by 8.40%. These results suggest that the primary driver of CO2 fluxes in alpine river source wetlands remains temperature factors; in scenarios where extreme climate events occur frequently, both extreme increases and decreases in precipitation have inhibitory effects on the global warming potential of alpine river source wetlands.

Field investigation revealed consistent supersaturated d-CH4 in surface water (relative to the theoretical value of d-CH4 at atmospheric equilibrium), with significant seasonal variations. Statistical analysis highlighted the direct impact of algal dynamics and the indirect effect of temperature and nutrients on d-CH4. Further lab-scale incubation demonstrated that CH4 production decreased by 55.25 to 93.65% with algae removal, while it increased 4 to 10 times with methylphosphonate (MPn) amendment. These findings argued that CH4 produced from algal metabolism related to MPn had a high potential for supersaturated d-CH4. It also verified the pivotal role of cyanobacteria in this mechanism, with temperature and light acting as regulatory factors. Through highlighting the role of algae for CH4 characteristics in cold-temperate mountainous freshwater and proposing the potential of oxic CH4 production through MPn metabolism in nutrient-limited lakes, this study enriches comprehension of aquatic CH4 cycle and warns about the importance of preserving environmental balance in freshwater with minimal human disturbance.

Iestyn			Enhanced heating effect of lakes under global warming	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Lakes play a crucial role in shaping both local and regional climates through heat exchange with the atmosphere. Amid global climate change, these interactions have undergone significant shifts. However, our understanding of the global heat release from lakes to the atmosphere, and its future trajectory, remains limited. In this study, we investigate changes in global lake heat release patterns and identify an amplified increase in heat release, particularly in mid to high latitudes (>45 degrees N). This amplification is linked with a feedback mechanism, where the reduction in lake ice cover not only reduces the insulating effect between the warmer lake water and the colder atmosphere but also leads to increased heat absorption by lakes. As a result, lakes in mid-high latitudes experience a greater relative increase in heat release, primarily through upward thermal radiation, compared to lakes at lower latitudes with comparable surface water temperature increases. Additionally, seasonal variations in latent heat flux intensify the heat release during warmer seasons compared to colder ones. Future projections suggest substantially greater heat release compared to historical trends.					; Chen, Deliang/ABF-1654-2021; Chen, Deliang/A-5107-2013; Qiu, Yuanlin/KPB-5898-2024; Thiery, Wim/AAJ-6692-2021; Mercado-Bettin, DANIEL/HPF-6131-2023; Xiong, Lihua/AAQ-3789-2020	Thiery, Wim/0000-0002-5183-6145; Chen, Deliang/0000-0003-0288-5618; Xiong, Lihua/0000-0001-6990-2414; 														2041-1723				APR 27	2025	16	1							3954	10.1038/s41467-025-59291-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59291-3								40289165					WOS:001478193600008

We quantified the sediment yield from continuous discharge measurements at six gauging stations during the rainy seasons of three consecutive years from April 2018 to December 2020, and using season-specific sediment rating curves developed based on 1938 suspended sediment samples. The average area-specific sediment yield (SSY) ranges from 1,887 to 19,517t km(-2) a(-1) for catchments ranging between 46 and 298 km(2), which is very high by world standards. Whilst SSY increases with catchment area in the highlands itself, an important decrease in SSY is observed in the lowland areas. The large alluvial fan complexes of Elgo and Shafe trap similar to 40 % and 60 % of the sediment delivered to the apex of the fans, respectively. The alluvial fans thus significantly reduce the amount of sediment delivered from the eroding highlands to the Rift Valley lakes and act as important sediment sink in the catchment's sediment budget.

Maastrichtian climate of southern Patagonia (Argentina): An approach from paleosols of the dinosaur-bearing Chorrillo Formation	CRETACEOUS RESEARCH												The upper Maastrichtian dinosaur-bearing Chorrillo Formation in southern Patagonia (similar to 50 degrees S, Austral-Magallanes Basin, Argentina) preserves successions of paleosols dominated by vertic features (i.e., the Argentino Lake hydromorphic Vertisols, the Perito Moreno Glacier calcic Vertisols, the Anita Farm Vertisols, the Centinela River Histosols, and the Chorrillo Malo Farm argillic Vertisols). To shed new light on and improve our understanding of the climate conditions that prevailed in southern Patagonia prior to the K/Pg extinction event, we used bulk geochemistry of the Chorrillo Formation paleosols to quantitatively reconstruct the latest Cretaceous climate at mid-high paleolatitudes of the Southern Hemisphere and compare them with late Maastrichtian global climate data derived from paleosols-based geochemical records. Bulk geochemical data indicate that pedogenesis occurred under moderate chemical weathering rates, which operated in a humid climate with a thermic regime (temperate-subtropical). These conditions align with previous qualitative interpretations based on macro- and micromorphological and mineralogical analyses of these paleosols, as well as palynological analyses of the Chorrillo Formation, which further demonstrate seasonality in rainfall. The climate data presented here are consistent with global paleoclimate reconstructions, where our study area (paleo-54 degrees S) lies within the Maastrichtian paleo-K & ouml;ppen climate zone "Temperate humid subtropical," suggesting that during the Maastrichtian, subtropical conditions extended toward the poles by at least 22 degrees of latitude in South America.

J	Matula, M; Wojtkowska, M				Matula, Magdalena; Wojtkowska, Malgorzata			Phosphorus speciation in water and sediments	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Phosphorus is an important component of surface water environments. The paper describes phosphorus speciation and factors influencing this phenomenon. A detailed description concerned the cycles of phosphorus transformations in the aquatic environment in relation to phosphorus speciation. Samples of water and bottom sediments along the entire length of the S & lstrok;uz(center dot)ewiecki Stream and from 7 adjacent ponds were collected and then analyzed. The paper presents the results of seasonal changes in the concentrations of phosphorus forms in the water column and bottom sediments in the S & lstrok;uz(center dot)ewiecki Stream. Analytical and numerical methods were used to determine the potential forms of phosphorus in water and bottom sediments. In the water column, three phosphorus forms were determined: orthophosphates, polyphosphates, and the organic form of phosphorus. In bottom sediments, phosphorus forms were analyzed using Psenner's sequential extraction scheme. The concentrations of phosphorus forms were related to water quality and the composition of bottom sediments. The presence of mineral forms of phosphorus in water was modeled using the PHREEQC program, which used physico-chemical parameters of water quality. The influence of parameters such as: temperature, pH, and concentrations of O2, calcium, iron, and aluminum ions, on the transformations of mineral forms of phosphorus in the aquatic environment was described. The results of research on chemical indicators of water quality confirm their influence on the distribution of phosphorus forms in surface waters. The stream sediments were particularly rich in phosphorus adsorbed on metal oxides, which can be released due to changes in pH. Organic phosphorus, sourced from benthic bacteria and allochthonous material, was also recognized as a significant reservoir of phosphorus in water and bottom sediments The obtained results also showed that oxygen deficits occurring during the lakes surface ice coverage result in the release of significant amounts of polyphosphates into the water column. In bottom sediments, a significant amount of phosphorus bound with the apatite fraction was also found. Active release of phosphorus from this apatit-bound fraction has been associated primarily with the cyclical increase in air temperature, which determines the water temperature in lowland streams and shallow polymictic reservoirs. The study demonstrated significant transformations of phosphorus forms in the water-sediment system in reservoirs and watercourses located in areas of high anthropopressure.

J	Haggqvist, K; Lindholm, T				Haggqvist, Kerstin; Lindholm, Tore			Phytoplankton, physical and chemical microscale variations in three brackish rock pools	PHYCOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Variations at the microscale in phytoplankton distribution with respect to physical and chemical variables in three brackish rock pools of different depth, size and exposure were studied during the growth season. Three hypotheses were made about the microspatial characteristics of the rock pool habitat: (i) there are distinct microscale variations in physical and chemical variables, (ii) the microscale distribution of phytoplankton is related to characteristic physical and/or chemical variables, and (iii) microscale variations are more pronounced in deep rock pools. Variations were studied at a 10 cm scale by close interval siphon sampling. Physical and chemical variations were small irrespective of rock pool. Prevailing weather, as well as the similar round basin shape of the pools contributed to the similarities. Variations in phytoplankton microscale distributions were clear and consistent throughout the study period, and less variable in the deepest pool compared to the shallower ones. The distribution of dominant phytoplankton species correlated with microscale variations in temperature, dissolved oxygen and pH, often during seasonal minima or maxima. The microscale correlations implied that short reaction times of phytoplankton enabled them to exploit, or be influenced by, brief, local variations. The results demonstrated the importance of studies at fine scales to disentangle processes even in shallow weather-influenced ecosystems.																			1322-0829	1440-1835				OCT	2016	64	4					241	250		10.1111/pre.12136	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pre.12136													WOS:000388304700005

Phytoplankton of Aras dam reservoir (Iran): an attempt to assess water quality	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES												The Aras reservoir, located in the north-west of Iran, plays an important role in fisheries, drinking and agricultural water supplies and recreational activities in the region. This study was performed to characterize the seasonal fluctuations of phytoplankton communities and their relationship with environmental factors in the Aras reservoir from August 2013 to May 2014. Sampling was carried out seasonally from 5 sampling locations. In each location three samples were taken for phytoplankton identification and enumeration, chemical analysis and chlorophyll a determination. In total, 72 species belonging to 5 divisions were determined. Cyanobacteria contained the highest density (74%) during the study period with Pseudanabaena limnetica as the most abundant species. This group retained its dominance the whole year round which indicated the poor quality and high nutrient load of the Aras reservoir, mainly due to human activities. On average, Trophic State Index (TSI) showed that water in the reservoir was eu-hypereutrophic. The results indicated that phytoplankton density negatively correlated with Secchi disc depth (R-2 = -0.479), total alkalinity (R-2 = -0.564), total hardness (R-2 = -0.727) and HCO3 concentration (R-2 = -0.589). On the other hand, there was a positive correlation between the phytoplankton density and TP (R-2 = 0.734). A comparison between the present and a previous study indicated that the cyanobacterial bloom pattern in the Aras reservoir has shifted from warm season toward an all year round cycle which in addition to basin pollution due to anthropogenic activities, can be related to global warming and climate change.																			1562-2916					OCT	2016	15	4					1318	1336																WOS:000392389000005
J	Pahl, JW; Mendelssohn, IA; Henry, CB; Hess, TJ				Pahl, JW; Mendelssohn, IA; Henry, CB; Hess, TJ			Recovery trajectories after in situ burning of an oiled wetland in coastal Louisiana, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The high degree of physical disturbance associated with conventional response options to oil spills in wetlands is driving the investigation of alternative cleanup methodologies. In March 1995, a spill of gas condensate in a brackish marsh at Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge in southwestern Louisiana was remediated through the use of in situ burning. An assessment of vegetation recovery was initiated in three treatment marshes: (1) oil-impacted and burned, (2) oil impacted and unburned, and (3) a nonoiled unburned reference. We compared percent cover, stem density, and biomass in the treatment marshes to define ecological recovery of the marsh vegetation and soil hydrocarbon content to determine the efficacy of in situ burning as a cleanup technique. Burning led to a rapid decrease in soil hydrocarbon concentrations in the impacted-and-burned marsh to background levels by the end of the first growing season. Although a management fire accidentally burned the oil-impacted-and-unburned and reference marshes in December 1995, stem density, live biomass, and total percent cover values in the oil-impacted-and-burned marsh were equivalent to those in the other treatment marshes after three years. In addition, plant community composition within the oil-impacted-and-burned marsh was similar to the codominant mix of the grasses Distichlis spicata (salt grass) and Spartina patens (wire grass) characteristic of the surrounding marsh after the same time period, Rapid recovery of the oil-impacted-and-unburned marsh was likely due to lower initial hydrocarbon exposure. Water levels inundating the soil surface of this grass-dominated marsh and the timing of the in situ burn early in the growing season were important factors contributing to the rapid recovery of this wetland. The results of this in situ burn evaluation support the conclusion that burning, under the proper conditions, can be relied upon as an effective cleanup response to hydrocarbon spills in herbaceous wetlands.																			0364-152X					FEB	2003	31	2					236	251		10.1007/s00267-002-2820-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-002-2820-6								12520379					WOS:000180389100007

Relationships between the water composition were studied. The chemical composition and seasonal change pattern depend a lot on hydrological factors which differed between eastern and western Latvia. Different pattern of long-term changes is found for substances which have different sources and sinks, at first for nutrients (decrease only in the last few years) and inorganic ingredients (commonly increasing trend). An attempt was made to identify the main sources of the major water ingredients and link changes of their concentrations with changes in loading to waters.

The genetic diversity among the isolates was evaluated using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) within the psbA gene family. Nine out of 13 isolates exhibit different DNA structures in the probed areas and, furthermore, they differ from morphologically similar strains collected from other lakes. The data set does not support a principal distinction between PC-rich and PE-rich strains but it reveals less heterogeneity in the coding region of the psbA genes among PE-rich isolates than among PC-rich isolates. The isolation of distinct strains in different seasons suggests species diversity and seasonal occurrence of Synechococcus spp. in Lake Constance.																			0168-6496					JUL	1995	17	3					197	203		10.1111/j.1574-6941.1995.tb00143.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.1995.tb00143.x													WOS:A1995RQ45700006

Our study aimed to assess how natural and human-modified land affects smooth newt (Lissotriton vulgaris) abundance in the surrounding waterbodies of Lake Balaton, a highly urbanized area. We conducted aquatic trap surveys at 32 wetland sites during the breeding season and quantified land cover within 250, 500, and 1000-m radius buffer zones. We hypothesized that urban land use, cropland, and proximity to roads and railways would negatively correlate with newt abundance, while wetlands areas (marshes, swamps, periodically flooded grasslands) and natural terrestrial habitats (grasslands, forests and woodlands) would positively correlate, with effects varying across spatial scales. N-mixture models were used to analyse survey data, estimating abundance and examining relationships with covariates. Results revealed that wetland cover within a 500-m buffer zone increased newt abundance, probably due to supporting metapopulation connectivity. In contrast, cropland cover within 250 m and proximity to roads and railways negatively affected newt abundance. Conservation efforts should prioritize providing smooth newts with adequate breeding habitats and reducing disturbances from croplands, roads, and railways.

J	BOUWMAN, AF				BOUWMAN, AF			AGRONOMIC ASPECTS OF WETLAND RICE CULTIVATION AND ASSOCIATED METHANE EMISSIONS	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Wetland rice cultivation is one of the major sources of atmospheric methane (CH4). Global rice production may increase by 65% between 1990 and 2025, causing an increase of methane emissions from a 92 Tg CH4 y-1 now to 131 Tg in 2025. Methane production depends strongly on the ratio oxidizing: reducing capacity of the soil. It can be influenced by e.g. addition of sulphate, which inhibits methanogenesis. The type and application mode of mineral fertilizers may also affect methane emissions. Addition of organic matter in the form of compost or straw causes an increase of methane emissions, but methane production is lower for materials with a low C/N ratio. High percolation rates in wetland rice soils and occasional drying up of the soil during the cultivation period depresses methane release. Water management practices aimed at reducing emissions are only feasible during specific periods in the rice growing season in flat lowland irrigated areas with high security of water availability and good control of the water supply. Intermittent drying of soils may not be possible on terraced rice lands. Assuming a 10 to 30% reduction in emission rates per unit harvested area, the global emission may amount to 93 Tg CH4 y-1 in 2025. A reduction of global emissions seems very difficult. To develop techniques for reducing CH4 emissions from wetland rice fields. research is required concerning interactions between soil chemical and physical properties. and soil, water and crop management and methanogenesis. Such techniques should not adversely affect rice yields.

Using a multi-proxy approach, including pollen and plant macrofossil data, stable carbon and oxygen isotopes, and grain size distributions, we assess the impact of local hydrological conditions on sedimentation and climatic signals. Biogenic sequences record vegetation succession and climatic fluctuations throughout the Eemian, with Koz & lstrok;o<acute accent>w preserving a more continuous archive, whereas Struga exhibits hydrological instability affecting depositional patterns. Pollen data enabled the identification and detailed characterisation of regional pollen assemblage zones (RPAZ), facilitating correlations with regional frameworks across Western and Eastern Europe. Isotopic records at Koz & lstrok;o<acute accent>w indicate evaporative enrichment linked to river inflow and intensified evaporation. In contrast, Struga functioned as a closed basin, with prolonged water residence time and isotope values reflecting internal hydrological balance. Grain size results highlight contrasting sedimentation regimes, with Koz & lstrok;o<acute accent>w showing a transition towards coarser material, suggesting growing fluvial influence, while Struga reveals episodic hydrological fluctuations within a closed-lake system. Climate reconstructions using PPPbase indicate pronounced seasonality and shifts in precipitation patterns during the interglacial. Our findings underscore the contrasting hydrological regimes of Koz & lstrok;o<acute accent>w and Struga, illustrating how local geomorphology and water balance shaped lake evolution. The palaeobotanical record further enhances understanding of catchment dynamics. By integrating isotopic and biological proxies, this study provides a refined reconstruction of Eemian climate evolution and a valuable framework for future interglacial research in Central Europe and beyond.

A total of eight ostracode species were found in the lake. Of these, Candona neglecta Sars, Isocypris beauchampi Paris and Cypria ophtalmica Jurine were the most common ostracodes at all depth stations. Darwinula stevensoni Brady & Robertson, Ilyocypris species (I. bradyi Sars and I. gibba (Ramdohr)), Cyprideis torosa (Jones) and Cyclocypris ovum Jurine, on the other hand, were confined to sublittoral and littoral areas of the lake. Substrate and organic matter content appeared to be relevant factors determining the distribution of ostracode species at the different stations. The highest abundance of ostracodes were in the sublittoral (Basin IV-7 m and Basin I-5 m) where the substrate was coarse and sediment had a high organic matter content (>35% LOI). Low oxygen levels in the hypolimnetic waters (i.e. <1 mg 1(-1)) may explain the absence of ostracodes at deeper zones in stations where the anoxic period lasts more than four months. On the other hand, low temperatures seem to favour the development of C. neglecta and D. stevensoni, while with higher temperatures I. beauchampi, C. torosa and C. ovum increased their abundances. However, no clear pattern can be observed, so ostracode species in Lake Banyoles, apparently, have non-seasonal life histories.																			0018-8158					AUG 25	1995	310	3					189	196		10.1007/BF00006830	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006830													WOS:A1995TD87200003

The epilimnetic population and the phosphorus status of the epilimnetic colonies were quantified. The numbers of colonies in the traps were greatest in the shallower areas. As the stratification became weaker and the epilimnetic population declined, the amount of colonies in all the traps increased markedly. Most of the colonies in the traps were due to redistribution within the water column. On the assumption that no epilimnetic uptake of phosphorus occurred in G. echinulata, the internal loading of phosphorus due to migrating colonies was calculated to be between 0.4 and 0.6 mg P m(-2) day(-1) during July and August. The proportion of newly migrated colonies in the epilimnetic G. echinulata population was calculated to be around 50% for the period before the epilimnetic population maximum. The increasing phosphorus content of the epilimnetic colonies after the population maximum indicates that the migration continued even after this.																			1323-1650						1995	46	1					287	293		10.1071/MF9950287	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF9950287													WOS:A1995RR56200032
J	Malkin, SY; Johannsson, OE; Taylor, WD				Malkin, SY; Johannsson, OE; Taylor, WD			Small-bodied zooplankton communities yet strong top-down effects on phytoplankton in the absence of fish	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												This investigation reports the community composition and biomass size-distribution of crustacean zooplankton communities in five small fishless lakes of the Precambrian Shield in Algonquin Provincial Park across one or two growing seasons. Contrary to predictions based on the size efficiency hypothesis and invertebrate predation models, zooplankton in these lakes were predominantly small. In most of the lakes surveyed, zooplankton communities were dominated by small calanoid copepods (mean adult body length < 1.0 mm). In only one lake did large zooplankton (mean adult body length > 1.5 mm) make up more than 25 % of the zooplankton biomass. Chaoborus abundance among these fishless lakes was an order of magnitude greater than in other lakes in the region with fish. We suggest the relatively small biomass of large bodied zooplankton compared with other fishless lakes is due to heavy Chaoborus predation combined with slowed zooplankton productivity in low pH waters. Despite the absence of large Cladocera, the relationship between zooplankton and phytoplankton biomass indicates strong "top-down" effects on phytoplankton. Grazing experiments in one of the lakes, and in a nearby lake with fish, indicate high grazing on some phytoplankton species, especially small dinoflagellates, and on protozoa.					; Malkin, Sairah/A-3713-2016	Taylor, William/0000-0001-8555-945X; Malkin, Sairah/0000-0002-7523-1589													0003-9136					MAR	2006	165	3					313	338		10.1127/0003-9136/2006/0165-0313	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2006/0165-0313													WOS:000237230100002

Evaluation of some heavy metals in water and health implications for fish consumers of the Great Cairo Sector of the Nile River	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Rivers serve crucial functions in the worldwide hydrological cycle. The industrial revolution, climate change, and urban development generated diverse water contaminants. This work aimed to assess the regional and seasonal distribution of some heavy metals (HMs) in the hot spot sites along the Great Cairo Sector, Nile River during 2021-2022. In addition, two commercial fish species (O. niloticus and C. gariepinus) were selected for assessing heavy metal content and human health risk. The results of heavy metals in water varied within; (1-7), (45-85.5), (19-84), (148-376), and (65-170) mu g/l for Cd, Cu, Pb, Mn, and Zn, respectively over the study period. The heavy metal pollution index (HPI) results categorized the water status as unsuitable for drinking and aquatic life, but ideal for irrigation purposes. Based on Metal Index (MI) values, all examined sites were significantly at risk of metal contamination (> 1) over all uses. In the two investigated species, The results of Cd, Cu, Pb, Mn, and Zn varied in the edible part of fish species within (0.2-0.28), (2.01-5.41), (0.21-1.11), (12.1-15.25), (20.91-32.52) mg/g ww, respectively, for O. niloticus and within (0.2-0.35), (3.12-6.5), (1.52-3.62), (15.01-17.72), (15.12-26.93) mg/g ww, respectively, for C. gariepinus over the study period. The total annual daily intake of HMs was estimated to be 0.03625 and 0.03725 mg/kg.bw.day from the human consumption of O. niloticus and C. gariepinus, respectively. The Target Hazard Quotient (THQ) ranked in the order of Cd > Pb > Mn > Zn > Cu for O. niloticus and in the order of Pb > Cd > Mn > Cu > Zn for C. gariepinus with values lower than 1 that reported non-carcinogenic risk for consumers from the ingestion of investigated HMs seperately. Moreover, the Health Hazard Index (HI) slightly exceeded the threshold value of 1 of C. gariepinus, classified as moderate risk levels for consumers. Conversely, HI values were below 1 for O. niloticus, suggesting no risk from this species' consumption. This study recommended an assertive water-quality monitoring strategy to mitigate health-related outbreaks and disruptions in aquatic ecosystems. The supplied data will undeniably assert environmental policymakers to implement sustainable pollution management and remediation measures.																			2045-2322					APR 12	2025	15	1							12632	10.1038/s41598-025-95308-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-95308-z								40221444					WOS:001466046000048

This study systematically examined Baiyangdian Lake (BYD) and its principal inflowing rivers, namely Fu River (FH), Baigouyin River (BGY), and Xiaoyi River (XY) to characterize the spatio-temporal distribution, primary nitrogen sources, and the impact on sediment microbial community structure. Results indicated pronounced seasonal variations in both nitrogen pollution loads and sources, with riverine nitrogen levels rising markedly from dry season (May) to wet season (August). Atmospheric deposition accounted for 43.9% of the nitrogen input dry season, whereas in wet season, agricultural fertilizers and sewage contributed 23.3 and 26.4%, respectively. Additionally, microbial communities exhibited distinct temporal and spatial patterns, with significantly higher diversity and species richness being during the wet season. The, microbial composition shifted, as evidenced by a decline in Proteobacteria and increases in Firmicutes and Actinobacteriota. River-lake connectivity emerged as a critical factor, with FH displaying a notably higher connectivity index in wet season compared to BGY and XY rivers. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis further revealed that river-lake connectivity was significantly and positively correlated with nitrogen pollution, was significantly and negatively correlated with microbial alpha-diversity. These findings demonstrated that river-lake connectivity directly influenced nitrogen concentrations, which in turn indirectly modulated microbial diversity.																				1664-302X				APR 11	2025	16								1563578	10.3389/fmicb.2025.1563578	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1563578								40291805					WOS:001474253900001

Despite its considerable impact, there remains a lack of comprehensive understanding of nitrate sources and discharge patterns, particularly in the Lake Victoria basin of East Africa. To address this gap, a study was conducted in the Kagera River basin, responsible for 33% of Lake Victoria's surface inflow. This study utilized delta 15N and delta 18O isotope analysis in nitrate, hydrochemistry, and the Bayesian mixing model (MixSIAR) to identify and quantify nitrate sources. Spatiotemporal data were collected across three seasons: long rains, dry season, and short rains, in areas with diverse land uses. Nitrate isotopic data from water and potential sources were integrated into a Bayesian mixing model to determine the relative contributions of various nitrate sources. Notable spatial variations were observed at sampling sites with concentrations ranging from 0.004 to 3.31 mg L-1. Spatially and temporally, delta 15N-NO3- values ranged from +6.0% to +10.2 parts per thousand, whereas delta 18O-NO3- displayed significant spatial differences with mean ranges from -1% to +7 parts per thousand. MixSIAR analysis revealed important contributions from manure and sewage sources ranging between 49% and 73%. A boron analysis revealed manure was the main source of nitrates in the manure and sewage. These results show that it is necessary to implement improved manure and sewage management practices, especially through proper waste treatment and disposal systems, to enable informed policy decisions to enhance nitrogen management strategies in riparian East Africa, and to safeguard the region's water resources and ecosystems.

J	Shen, QK; Chen, QH; Liu, XG				Shen, Qikai; Chen, Qihao; Liu, Xiuguo			Spatial analysis of interannual changes in thermokarst lakes across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau with Time-Series SAR imagery	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The climate changes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) have led to the widespread development of thermokarst lakes in permafrost regions. The seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation in the permafrost regions of the QTP affect the intra-annual state of thermokarst lakes. The intra-annual seasonal variations of thermokarst lakes pose challenges for accurately capturing inter-annual changes. To accurately obtain inter-annual change information of thermokarst lakes, this study proposes a method for capturing inter-annual changes of thermokarst lakes based on the "thaw-freeze" transition points and time-series SAR imagery. This method identifies the "thaw-freeze" transition points for thermokarst lakes across the entire Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, ensuring that each lake is in a similar thermal state, and proposes an improved U-net-based extraction algorithm for thermokarst lakes. This algorithm leverages the transition points and SAR imagery's polarization, statistical, and temporal features to accurately capture the changes in thermokarst lakes over the years. The study obtained the extent and inter-annual changes of thermokarst lakes from 2015 to 2022, achieving an accuracy of 91.01% and an F1 score of 0.92. The change extraction results identified spatial heterogeneity in the changes of thermokarst lakes on the QTP. Further investigation explored the impacts of surface temperature, precipitation, and evapotranspiration on the changes in thermokarst lakes. The analysis revealed a higher correlation between thermokarst lake area changes and land surface temperature, while the correlation with precipitation and evapotranspiration changes was relatively lower.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				OCT	2025	659								133269	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.133269	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.133269		APR 2025											WOS:001469503600001
J	Chen, J; Wang, LS; Chen, C; Peng, ZR				Chen, Jun; Wang, Linsong; Chen, Chao; Peng, Zhenran			Downscaling and Gap-Filling GRACE-Based Terrestrial Water Storage Anomalies in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Using Deep Learning and Multi-Source Data	REMOTE SENSING												The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), a critical hydrological regulator for Asia through its extensive glacier systems, high-altitude lakes, and intricate network of rivers, exhibits amplified sensitivity to climate-driven alterations in precipitation regimes and ice mass balance. While the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its Follow-On (GRACE-FO) missions have revolutionized monitoring of terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSAs) across this hydrologically sensitive region, spatial resolution limitations (3 degrees, equivalent to similar to 300 km) constrain process-scale analysis, compounded by mission temporal discontinuity (data gaps). In this study, we present a novel downscaling framework integrating temporal gap compensation and spatial refinement to a 0.25 degrees resolution through Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural networks, an architecture optimized for univariate time series modeling. Through the assimilation of multi-source hydrological parameters (glacier mass flux, cryosphere-precipitation interactions, and land surface processes), the GRU-based result resolves nonlinear storage dynamics while bridging inter-mission observational gaps. Grid-level implementation preserves mass conservation principles across heterogeneous topographies, successfully reconstructing seasonal-to-interannual TWSA variability and also its long-term trends. Comparative validation against GRACE mascon solutions and process-based hydrological models demonstrates enhanced capacity in resolving sub-basin heterogeneity. This GRU-derived high-resolution TWSA is especially valuable for dissecting local variability in areas such as the Brahmaputra Basin, where complex water cycling can affect downstream water security. Our study provides transferable methodologies for mountainous hydrogeodesy analysis under evolving climate regimes. Future enhancements through physics-informed deep learning and next-generation climatology-hydrology-gravimetry synergy (e.g., observations and models) could further constrain uncertainties in extreme elevation zones, advancing the predictive understanding of Asia's water tower sustainability.						, jun/0000-0002-0942-4577														2072-4292				APR 8	2025	17	8							1333	10.3390/rs17081333	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs17081333													WOS:001476421900001

The most common planting patterns-monocropping and mixed cropping-are well-studied in terms of vegetation structure, productivity, and soil nutrients. Despite their significance, the influence of prolonged planting practices on underground soil microbial communities and metabolites has often been neglected. In this study, two characteristic plants, Festuca sinensis 'Qinghai' and Poa pratensis 'Qinghai', from the area around Qinghai Lake were selected as the experimental subjects by employing 16 S and ITS sequencing methods in conjunction with non-targeted metabolomics analysis. The effects of planting patterns (monocropping and mixed cropping) on rhizosphere soil characteristics, metabolites and microbial community structure were examined. The results showed that compared with monocropping, mixed cropping significantly increased the contents of soil nutrients and key metabolites. In addition, it had a greater impact on fungal diversity than bacterial diversity, particularly in terms of beta-diversity. While microbial alpha-diversity and dominant phyla remained stable, soil fungi were more responsive to changes in soil properties and metabolites. These results show that the new niche differentiation between different species in mixed grassland stimulates the secretion of trehalose and valine, which further affects the fungal community structure and enhances the soil nutrients and ecological functions of degraded grasslands. These findings will guide the restoration of degraded grasslands around Qinghai Lake and the selection of planting strategies to improve local sustainable grassland productivity.

TDR incorporation data from a field study were then converted to carbon production with the established empirical CF and a theoretical CF and compared to production estimates derived from leucine incorporation. Mean empirical CF varied between 0.5 and 7.0 x 10(6) cells (pmol TDR)(-1) over the year and showed highly significant negative correlation with TDR incorporation rate and a highly significant positive correlation to temperature. Values of carbon production derived with the variable empirical CF were lower than the values obtained by the use of the theoretical CF of 1 X 10(6) cells (pmol TDR)(-1). They showed less seasonal variation than values obtained by leucine incorporation, and periods of uncoupling were observed. However, when the empirical CF was calculated from the multiple regression equation including TDR incorporation and temperature, the resulting carbon production rates showed a h h correspondence with the leucine-derived production rates. Results of the analyses were interpreted as an indication that under favourable conditions (resulting in high TDR incorporation) bacteria may be able to optimize DNA duplication over protein synthesis as a possible strategy to persist and to maintain their potential to divide under limiting conditions (e.g. decrease in temperature and substrate availability). In unfavourable conditions (resulting in low incorporation rates), bacteria may then use already produced DNA copies for rapid growth, when the environmental conditions turn favourable again. Thus, an experimental set-up causing nutrient enrichment of the sampled water by autoclaving and filtering, as generally used for dilution culture experiments, does not always reflect in situ situations, specially during periods of low nutrient concentrations.

The spatial and temporal diversity patterns and mechanisms governing these microbial communities are not yet well understood. Our study revealed that microbial richness decreased rapidly during the initial freezing period. However, it began to increase during the deep freezing period due to the role of cold-resistant microorganisms. Meanwhile, the diversity of microorganisms showed a trend that was in line with the lake water- groundwater changes in temperature. Achromobacter and Crenothrix have been designated as biomarkers for the initial freezing period and deep freezing period, respectively. In these phases, factors such as dispersal limitation (26.8 %-47.6 %) and drift (15.1 %-45.2 %), along with other random factors, are the primary drivers of bacterial community assembly. Physical properties (pH, T, DO, EC, Eh) have been identified as the predominant factors (r = 0.75, p < 0.01) affecting the progression of community succession in hyporheic systems throughout the freeze-thaw cycles. Conversely, nutrient properties (r = 0.36, p < 0.01) and the presence of heavy metals (r = 0.18, p < 0.01) play lesser roles, influencing community composition according to partial least squares path modeling. Our insights significantly enhance the understanding of microbial communities in the HZ of frigid areas and carry important consequences for the stewardship and safeguarding of lacustrine ecosystems.																			0043-1354	1879-2448				AUG 1	2025	281								123555	10.1016/j.watres.2025.123555	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2025.123555		APR 2025						40187145					WOS:001465304700001

The impact of spatio-temporal resolution and vertical accuracy of DEMs on flood modeling has been widely concerned in previous studies. However, due to variations in data acquisition season and geographical coverage of each DEM, it still remains unclear how much variation exists in the extent of exposed topography provided by different DEMs over the global floodplains. Furthermore, how to select and jointly use the various DEM data sources for achieving the maximum level of exposed topography coverage also requires to be further explored. This study selected three DEMs (SRTM DEM, ASTER DEM, and FABDEM) to evaluate their capability of offering the topographic exposure extent within global floodplains by proposing the topographic exposure index (TEI). The results show that the global average TEI is highest for SRTM DEM, followed by ASTER DEM, while FABDEM has the lowest average TEI. The difference in TEI distribution between FABDEM and the other two DEMs is the most significant. Moreover, the TEI of these three DEMs has remarkably inconsistent performances in spatial sub-zones. In regions such as southern China, central India, and Brazil, the TEI of SRTM DEM and ASTER DEM is significantly higher compared to FABDEM, largely influenced by human activities such as dam-induced reservoir water impoundment areas and aquacultures. In contrast, FABDEM shows significantly higher TEI than the other two DEMs in Canada and central Siberia, as well as in regions with saline lakes (e.g., the Great Salt Lake, Lake Razzaza), predominantly influenced by climatic and hydrologic features. The joint use of these three DEM datasets with appropriate fusing strategy may expand the exposed topographic area of global floodplains, at an equivalent magnitude of the Nile floodplain area (2.67 x 105 km2).					; xu, pengju/OLQ-2238-2025	Song, Chunqiao/0000-0003-1060-4636; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				SEP	2025	658								133205	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.133205	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.133205		APR 2025											WOS:001462922600001

Precisely mapping how the enhancement and expansion of the African Monsoon during these humid periods have affected landscape evolution and human occupation dynamics in Arabia remains a scientific challenge. Here we reconstruct an ancient water-sculpted landscape consisting of lake and river deposits, coupled with a large outlet valley in the Rub' al Khali Desert of Saudi Arabia. During the peak of the Holocene Humid Period or before, intense rainfall reactivated alluvial floodplains and filled a similar to 1100 km(2) topographic depression, which eventually breached, carving a deep similar to 150 km-long valley. Coupling geologic reconstructions with transient Earth system model simulations shows that this hydrological activity was linked to higher seasonal precipitation punctuated by repeated heavy events. Analysis of lacustrine and fluvial sedimentary deposits implies sediment routing across distances of up to 1000 km from the Asir Mountains. Our results indicate that such intense flooding challenges the conventional view of simple, weak, and linear landscape stabilization following increased rainfall in Arabia. Our findings highlight the crucial role of an enhanced African Monsoon in driving rapid landscape transformations in the Arabian Desert.

Sampling was conducted using seine nets across the four phases of the local hydrological cycle (rising, high-water, receding, and low-water) during the year 2018 in Lake Maic & aacute;. The species were identified and classified into four functional groups on the basis of their ecological traits (migration, life history strategy, feeding habits, and swimming performance/microhabitat use). A total of 6075 individuals were captured, representing nine orders, 26 families, and 104 species. The fish assemblages underwent changes in both taxonomic and functional structure in response to the hydrological phases and limnological variables (pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and water transparency), with an increase in functional diversity during the receding water and low-water phase. During the low-water period, there was an increase in the abundance of fish with life history strategies at equilibrium, small periodic species as well as invertivores, piscivores, short-distance migrants, and residents. In contrast, the rising and high-water phases contributed to higher abundances of young fish (larvae and juveniles) and medium-distance migratory fish. The synergy among these factors acts as an environmental filter in the structure of the local ichthyofauna, allowing species with antagonistic ecological traits to coexist, maintain their populations, and reduce competition for space and food under varying environmental conditions during the four phases of the annual hydrological cycle. The information presented is essential for identifying priority areas for the conservation of fish assemblages, which represent the primary source of animal protein and income for the region, and for understanding the mechanisms responsible for changes in the taxonomic and functional structure of fish in Amazonian floodplain lakes.

J	Joseph, AM; Gandhi, MS				Joseph, Anju Maria; Gandhi, Marimuthu Suresh			Assessment of Potentially Toxic Elements Contamination in Water and Sediments from Vembanad Lake, Kerala, India: In Accounts with the Influence of its Major In Flow Rivers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The current study assesses the ecological risk and pollution levels of Vembanad Lake and the rivers that feed it, focusing particular attention to the concentration, spatial distribution and risk of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in the sediments and water. The Perkin Elmer-PinAAcle 900AA Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer was used to analyse the PTEs concentrations in study area during pre-monsoon and post monsoon seasons. The pollution by Pb, Cd, Cr, Cu, and Zn was assessed using the recommended sediment quality guideline issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). To determine the anthropogenic influence of potentially toxic elements on the ecosystem, several metrics were computed, including the pollution load index (PLI), ecological risk factor (Eri), geo-accumulation index (Igeo), contamination factor (CF), and statistical analyses (Pearson's Correlation). Findings showed that most metals peaked in the post-monsoon season at their highest average concentration. The northern Vembanad Lake has the highest level of potentially toxic elements contamination, while the southern Vembanad Lake has lower levels of contamination, Moreover, the rivers that drain into the northern half of Vembanad Lake have higher quantities of potentially toxic elements than the rivers that flow into the southern part of the lake. River contributions to potentially toxic elements in lake were as follows: Periyar (PE) > Muvattupuzha (MO) > Meenachil (ME) > Manimala (MA) > Pamba (PA) > Achancovil (AC). The PLI results show that the sediment samples from Vembanad Lake and the Periyar River are contaminated since their PLI values are more than 1 for both seasons. The majority of the potentially toxic elements have strong positive correlations (r > 0.8) that point to similar origins. The aforementioned results underscore the vital necessity of ongoing surveillance and efficient administration to safeguard the ecological integrity of lakes. A sustainable management of the aquatic ecology in the research region will be facilitated by the findings of this study.																			1735-6865	2008-2304				APR	2025	19	2							62	10.1007/s41742-024-00734-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41742-024-00734-y													WOS:001394947500001

However, how DOM affects phytoplankton functional diversity (FD) and resource use efficiency (RUE), especially in contrasting lake types is not well-known. In the study reported here, we explored the influences of DOM on phytoplankton FD and the RUEs of nitrogen and phosphorus in three lakes (i.e., a deep oligotrophic lake, Lake Fuxian; a shallow mesotrophic lake, Lake Erhai, and a shallow eutrophic lake, Lake Qilu), all located in southwest China. We found that the relationships between DOM properties and phytoplankton composition, FD and RUEs differed in these three lakes and exhibited seasonality. Partial least squares path modeling revealed the different pathways by which dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration influenced phytoplankton FD and RUE between the lakes. In Lake Fuxian, DOC promoted RUE by positively affecting phytoplankton FD and indirectly regulated FD and RUE by affecting water transparency and temperature. In Lake Erhai, DOC affected RUE by altering nutrient supplements. In Lake Qilu, in addition to the negative direct influence of DOC on FD, DOC affected FD or RUE by regulating water transparency and temperature. These results imply that the modulation of DOM on available resources will shift across lake depth and trophic state gradients, profoundly affecting phytoplankton diversity and/or ecosystem functioning. Our study provides a reference for furthering current understanding of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning in lakes, particularly within the context of environmental pressures such as increased DOM and nutrient levels.

This system generates to unique seasonal fluctuations, forming a distinctive seasonal lake system, which influences hydrological and hydrodynamic processes across floodplains. Recent years have witnessed significant alterations in the hydrological patterns of the Yangtze River, notably in water levels, thereby impacting the nutrient dynamics such as nitrogen transformation at the sediment-water interface of Poyang Lake. This study establishes a coupled model integrating hydrodynamics and nitrogen transformation to elucidate the impacts of the hydrological regime of Yangtze River on nitrogen transformation in Poyang Lake after the operation of Three Gorges Dam. Findings reveal spatiotemporal variations in both hydraulics and nitrogen transformation within the seasonal lake system. Notably, the recharge rate between surface water and groundwater experiences a substantial shift, surpassing 60%. Furthermore, the nitrification rate at the sediment-water interface escalates by 28.5%, and the denitrification rate increases by 21.3% owing to pronounced alterations in the hydrological regime. However, this intensified transformation does not translate to enhanced efficiency, as the nitrogen transformation efficiency declines to 72.3% of its original rate. This research provides a theoretical framework for understanding the ecological and environmental impacts of human interventions on Poyang Lake and highlights the implications for managing other floodplains and seasonal lakes globally, such as lakes on floodplains of Amazon River and Mekong River, which face similar challenges in hydrological dynamics and ecosystem health.

J	Geary, RJ; Driscoll, CT				Geary, RJ; Driscoll, CT			Forest soil solutions: Acid/base chemistry and response to calcite treatment	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Soil solution chemistry was investigated at a forested watershed draining into Woods Lake, N.Y. as part of the Experimental Watershed Liming Study (EWLS). The objective of this study was to assess the response of soil water to watershed treatment of calcite (CaCO3). This material was applied in an effort to mitigate the effects of acidic atmospheric deposition. Soil solutions draining Oa and Bs horizons in reference subcatchments were characterized by low pH and acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) due to elevated concentrations of SO42-, NO3- and organic anions relative to the sum of base cation (C-B: Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+) concentrations. Seasonal and spatial variation of pH and ANC in soil solutions appeared to be largely controlled by variations in the concentrations of dissolved organic acids which, in rum, were regulated by reactions of Al with soil organic matter. Nitrate was positively correlated and SO42- was negatively correlated with Ca2+ and Al concentrations in reference soil solutions, indicating that changes in NO3- influences spatial and seasonal variations in Ca2+ and Al concentrations. On this basis, NO3- appears to be important in soil acidification and the dynamics of drainage water acidity. Comparison of our results with historical data for the site showed declines in concentrations of SO42-, which are consistent with decreases in emissions of SO2 in the eastern U.S. and atmospheric deposition of SO42- to the Adirondack region. Mineral soil solutions have shown large increases in concentrations of NO3-. Declines in concentrations of C-B and increases in concentrations of Al have occurred over the last ten years, suggesting depletion of soil pools of exchangeable basic cations and increased sensitivity to acidic deposition. Calcite (CaCO3) treatment of 6.89 Mg/ha resulted in a significant increase of Co2+, ANC and pH in both Oa and Bs horizon soil solutions. Soil water response to CaCO3 addition was most evident during the first year after treatment, apparently due to macropore transport of particulate and dissolved CaCO3.

Stony and Twelve Mile lakes contain populations of Mysis with a l-yr life cycle, while Crystal and Boshkung lakes have populations with a 2-yr life cycle. Mature female and male mysids have a lipid content between 15 and 33% and between 14 and 25%, respectively, while juvenile mysids have approximately 10% less total lipids than adults. The relationship between total lipid and lipid-free dry weight is best described by the power curve Y = aX(b) and is the same (ANCOVA, p < 0.05) in all four mysid populations. Lipid content accumulates steadily with time as the mysid grows, and lipid reserves do not appear to influence mysid time to maturity. For studies on the transfer of energy and lipophilic organic contaminants through the food web, the results imply that seasonal and body size differences of organisms are important considerations.																			0706-652X					SEP	1994	51	9					1935	1941		10.1139/f94-195	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f94-195													WOS:A1994QF32000004

This research focuses on controlling eutrophication in dam-controlled rivers, with particular attention to the Huaidian Dam on China's Shaying River. The primary objective of this research was to identify the key nutrients and their transportation processes affecting algal growth during the non-flood season. To achieve this, we analyzed algal density, species diversity, and the distribution of key nutrients, including ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), and total phosphorus (TP) across dissolved, suspended, and sediment phases in both the hyporheic zone and surface water. The results reveal that diatoms dominate the algal community, comprising 66.91 % of the total composition and displaying higher cell density and biomass. Nutrient concentrations were mainly observed downstream of the dam, with NH4+-N predominantly detected in sediments (2.92-9.23 mg/kg) and pore water (1.1-13.5 mg/L), NO3--N in sediment (2.5-12 mg/kg), and TP mainly in sediments (50-70 mg/kg). Redundancy analysis demonstrated that NO3--N in overlying water, sediment, and pore water were critical for algal growth, contributing 78.9 %, 77.5 %, and 75 %, respectively. Our findings suggest that the interaction between NO3--N transport and transformation within sediments and pore water is a significant factor influencing algal growth during non-flood seasons. This study highlights the influence of nutrient transport and transformation at the water-sediment interface for algal growth and recommends targeted measures to mitigate eutrophication risks in dam-controlled rivers.																			2211-9264					JUN	2025	88								104017	10.1016/j.algal.2025.104017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2025.104017		MAR 2025											WOS:001458412300001

In this study, we investigate the paleohydrological evolution of the Fuente de Piedra playa-lake (southern Spain), in connection to climate fluctuations during the Late Pleistocene-Holocene transition. Stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta H-2) of gypsum hydration water were analyzed to reconstruct the delta O-18 and delta H-2 values of lake water over the past similar to 30,000 years. The highest water delta-values (up to 6.4 parts per thousand for delta O-18 and 24.0 parts per thousand for delta H-2) corresponded to periods when Fuente de Piedra featured as a (semi-)permanent lake (e.g. 22-18.5 cal. kyr BP, 17.4-14.4 cal. kyr BP, 7.0-5.9 cal. kyr BP), coinciding with relatively wetter climate stages in the southern Iberian Peninsula. Conversely, the lowest delta-values (e.g. -1.1 parts per thousand for delta O-18 and -13.0 parts per thousand for delta H-2 between 11.8 and 9.2 cal. ky BP) and periods of no gypsum precipitation (e.g. 12.8-11.8 cal. kyr BP, 5.5 cal. kyr BP-present) are associated with ephemeral lake conditions and more arid climate. This isotope pattern reflects an intensified interaction between the lake and the underlying brackish aquifer during more stable lake stages, driven by wetter climatic conditions. However, during drier phases the lake water was fresher, since reduced aquifer recharge limited the interaction between the brackish groundwater and the lake. Over the long term, the Fuente de Piedra isotope record reveals a sinusoidal pattern that indicates variations in warm-season insolation, confirming orbital control over the hydroclimate of the southern Iberian Peninsula during the Late Pleistocene-Holocene transition.

Ecology of greater sage-grouse populations inhabiting the northwestern Wyoming Basin	HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS												Range-wide population declines of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse) have been largely attributed to habitat loss and fragmentation. However, the specific conservation threats affecting the ecology of sage-grouse populations may differ by region. Although the status of the Bear Lake Plateau and Valley (BLPV) sage grouse populations in the Wyoming Basin has been monitored using male lek counts since the 1960s, little was known about their ecology, seasonal movements, and habitat use patterns. From 2010-2012, we radio-marked 153 sage-grouse (59 females and 94 males) with very high frequency necklace-style radio-collars throughout the BLPV study area, which encompassed parts of Bear Lake County, Idaho, and Rich County, Utah. We subsequently monitored the radio-marked sage-grouse to estimate the factors affecting vital rates, seasonal movements, and habitat use. Radio-marked sage-grouse primarily used seasonal habitats in Idaho and Utah, but some individuals used seasonal habitats in Wyoming. The average annual survival rate for the radio-marked sage-grouse was 53% (3%). Average female nest success (23%; 95% CI = 18-29%) was lower than range-wide estimates. Brood success varied between 2011 and 2012, with higher brood survival observed in 2012. Twenty-four percent of radio-marked sage-grouse were migratory, engaging in seasonal movements >= 10 km. Annual home range estimates using kernel density estimator (101 km(2)) for radio-marked sage-grouse were within estimates previously reported. However, poor recruitment attributed to low nest and brood survival may be impacting overall population stability. Because the radio-marked sage-grouse used seasonal habitats in 3 states, we recommend that Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming coordinate in the development of a tri-state management plan to better conserve this population.																			1934-4392	1936-8046				FAL	2016	10	2					188	204																WOS:000392258500012

Ultrastructural investigations carried out on the minute sponges gave evidence that they were functional and contained diatoms both free in the sponge mesohyl and enclosed in cytoplasmic vacuoles of the wandering cells. Vacuoles contained a single diatom of different size (about 9 x 5 mum the largest; about 5.7 x 3.8 mum the smallest) and in various phases of degradation. Although sponges are known to host auto- and heterotrophic symbionts, this is the first report of their progressive digestion of endocellular diatoms up to the final fragmentation of their frustule.

Water temperature of 12degreesC and phytoplankton blooms triggered spawning, and seasonal variation in gametogenesis was related to photoperiod. Some mussels at 25 m depth always had active gonads, and reproduction continued all year, with no seasonal gametogenic phases. Hypolimnetic environmental conditions, such as slight variation in water temperature, darkness and low food availability, may cause this reproductive strategy. No evidence of hermaphroditism or modified sex ratios were noted at either depth. Gametogenesis and spawning ability of zebra mussels in the hypolimnion must be reconsidered.

J	Simms, MJ				Simms, MJ			The origin of enigmatic, tubular, lake-shore karren: A mechanism for rapid dissolution of limestone in carbonate-saturated waters	PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Vertical, upward tapering, closed tubes (here termed "rohrenkarren") have been observed in abundance in limestone exposed in the epiphreatic zone around several lakes in Ireland. Rohrenkarren form by condensation corrosion within air pockets trapped by seasonal floodwaters. This promotes rapid limestone dissolution where lake, or cave, waters are at or near saturation with respect to calcium carbonate. Their abundance testifies to the large-scale dissolution of limestone and simultaneous enhancement of carbonate precipitation in carbonate-saturated environments where dissolution directly by lake water is very limited. Lake-specific differences in rohrenkarren morphometry provide a unique record of the long-term water chemistry at each site. The underlying mechanism has implications for other solid-liquid interfaces.																			0272-3646					JAN-FEB	2003	23	1					1	20																WOS:000180057500001

Pond water microbiome antibiotic resistance genes vary seasonally with environmental pH and tannins	MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM												Microbial communities of small freshwater bodies interact dynamically with environmental factors in unknown ways. Longitudinal sampling of four ponds in Knox County, Ohio, revealed relationships among antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and environmental factors such as pH and tannin concentrations. For each site, microbial communities were collected by filtration, and metagenomes were analyzed by short-read sequencing. ARGs were quantified using the ShortBRED pipeline to detect and quantify hits to a marker set derived from the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database. The top 30 ARGs showed increased abundance at the end of the growing season. The top two ARGs with the largest marker hits encode components of a Stenotrophomonas drug efflux pump powered by proton-motive force (smeABC) and a mycobacterial global regulator that activates a drug pump and acid stress response (mtrA). The smeABC and mtrA prevalence showed a modest correlation with acidifying conditions (low pH and high tannic acids). Acidity amplifies the transmembrane pH difference component of the proton-motive force, thus increasing the cell's energy available for pump function and ARG expression. Association with microbial taxa was tested by the Kraken2/Bracken predictor of taxa profiles. The ARG profiles showed the strongest acid dependence in ponds with a high proportion of Proteobacteria, whereas a pond with high Cyanobacteria showed the lowest ARG counts. Efflux pumps such as SmeABC and transcriptional activation by MtrA incur large energy expenditures whose function may be favored at low external pH, where the cell's proton-motive force is maximal.																				2165-0497				MAY 6	2025	13	5								10.1128/spectrum.03034-24	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.03034-24		MAR 2025						40130858					WOS:001451246900001

The salinity and seasonal icing of lakes play a crucial role in brGDGT calibration, with calibrations varying between tropical, mid-high latitude, and freshwater versus nonfreshwater lacustrine sediments, which complicates their universality. Furthermore, changes in a lake's salinity and seasonal icing during glacial and interglacial cycles can influence the accuracy of paleotemperature reconstructions across different time periods. In this study, we present improved global calibrations based on a comprehensive lacustrine brGDGT dataset consisting of 949 samples, utilizing methods such as linear regression for the fractional abundance of key brGDGTs and support vector machine regression with a linear kernel. The calibrations yield root mean square errors ranging from approximately 2.0 degrees C-2.6 degrees C for the test dataset, closely matching those obtained from the training dataset, indicating that the results are not overfitted. These calibrations show improved performance when applied to lake sediment sequences.

However, their response to altitude gradients remains poorly understood. In this study, we applied a metabarcoding approach to explore eukaryotic phytoplankton community structure, co-occurrence networks, and assembly processes along a steep altitudinal gradient (590-4500 m) in the Nyang River and the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau during dry and wet seasons. Using 18S rDNA sequencing, we obtained 2852 amplicon sequence variants. Our results demonstrated that Ochrophyta was the dominant taxon in the eukaryotic phytoplankton community across both seasons. Alpha diversity exhibited distinct seasonal patterns, decreasing monotonically with increasing altitude in the dry season whereas the highest diversity was observed at medium altitudes in the wet season. Phytoplankton co-occurrence networks became more topologically complex as species diversity increased. Among environmental factors, altitude (r = 0.62), water temperature (r = 0.52) and pH (r = 0.51) significantly influenced phytoplankton communities. Stochastic processes globally dominated phytoplankton community assembly (66 %) and became increasingly influential from dry season (51 %) to wet season (71 %). Their impact gradually increased from low altitude (57 %) to medium altitude (64 %), but deterministic processes overwhelming dominated community assembly at the higher altitude in both seasons (dry season: 95 %, wet season 71 %). In summary, these findings enhance our understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of eukaryotic phytoplankton communities in highland rivers and the maintenance of planktonic diversity along elevational gradients.																			0013-9351	1096-0953				JUN 15	2025	275								121427	10.1016/j.envres.2025.121427	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2025.121427		MAR 2025						40113062					WOS:001456195400001

In some cases, mean biomass among transects differed by nearly two orders of magnitude while differences within transects differed by more than one order of magnitude. Annual lakewide zooplankton biomass, incorporating these spatial features, was 824 +/- 167 mu g l(-1). Further use and refinement of continuous automated samplers, such as optical plankton counters, will help overcome sampling and data-processing limitations of traditional collecting techniques, as well as provide spatially explicit data on which to build more realistic models of predator-prey interactions and energy flow in complex systems.

However, we know little about their responses to seasonal environmental fluctuations, under eutrophication in reservoir ecosystems. In this study, we studied the shifts of PAB communities to seasonal environmental fluctuations in tropical China. Trophic state index (TSI) indicated that the studied reservoirs ranged from mesotrophic to eutrophic state with a gradual increase in TSI from 31 to 58. In eutrophic reservoirs, Cyanobacteria, especially Raphidiopsis raciborskii, significantly increased in its relative abundance from the wet to dry season, but Synechococcales and Microcystaceae decreased. In contrast, the relative abundance of Clostridia, Bacilli, Coriobacteriia, Enterobacteriales, and Vibrionales were more susceptible to seasonal environmental fluctuations in mesotrophic than eutrophic reservoirs. PAB co-occurrence relationships in mesotrophic reservoirs varied more greatly in response to seasonal environmental fluctuations, compared with eutrophic reservoirs, in terms of topological properties of connectedness, average degree, robustness, and vulnerability. Our results further demonstrated that the seasonal stability of PAB co-occurrence relationships was strongly correlative with TSI through mediating key bacterial taxa and community biodiversity. We proposed that eutrophication dramatically reduced the seasonal variation of PAB community compositions and co-occurring relationships in reservoir ecosystems. Eutrophication dramatically reduced the seasonal variation of particle-attached bacterial communities and destroyed the composition succession of particle-attached bacterial communities in reservoir ecosystems.					; Ren, Lijuan/AAC-7220-2022	Ren, Lijuan/0000-0002-9299-7527; 													0168-6496	1574-6941				MAR 20	2025	101	4							fiae154	10.1093/femsec/fiae154	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fiae154								39510965					WOS:001448046500001

Previous studies of the population have shown that many males and females fail to breed in a given season and that males are effectively semelparous. Age at first reproduction among males of a cohort appears to be mediated by size, which may in part explain the large number of males failing to breed in a given year. We suggest that competition among cohorts of males result in older males breeding earlier within a season than younger males and that differences in reproductive timing within a season ultimately determine the age at which males of the next generation reproduce. We argue that the observed differences in age at reproduction among males are not alternative life histories, but are the result of a single alternating life history pattern in which males breeding at a young age produce male offspring that breed at an old age and vice versa. The evolution of alternative life histories is not expected because differences in age at reproduction are largely environmentally determined. The high fecundity and large early mortality of fishes make it impractical to directly follow individuals from egg to adulthood, but individual-based computer models should allow us to examine populations for the potential to show such a pattern of life history alternation, and permit us to make precise predictions of consequential population change.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAY	1993	122	3					500	510		10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<0500:ALHOSB>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<0500:ALHOSB>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1993LR87600019

Designing Sortable Guilds for Multispecies Selective Fish Passage	FISH AND FISHERIES												The importance of connectivity for freshwater organisms is widely recognised, yet in-stream barriers associated with population declines and increased risk of extinction remain globally ubiquitous. Despite their negative consequences, these barriers can protect aquatic communities by limiting the spread of invasive species, leading to conflicting management goals in some regions. Selective fish passage is a solution for the conflicting goals of passing native, desirable species while restricting the spread of invasives. Approaches that can target groups of species sharing similar attributes (i.e. guilds) are likely to be more efficient than those that target species individually, particularly in taxonomically diverse systems. We explored the guild structure of 220 Great Lakes freshwater fishes based on morphological, phenological, physiological and behavioural attributes associated with passage and movement. We identified five distinct guilds as well as the attributes most important for defining these groupings: maximum total length, trophic level, relative eye size, spawning temperature, spawning season, presence/absence of ampullary electroreceptors and the presence/absence of hearing specialisations. The approaches outlined in this work can be generalised to enhance selective fish passage in aquatic ecosystems worldwide.

J	Lambrych, KL; Hassett, JP				Lambrych, KL; Hassett, JP			Wavelength-dependent photoreactivity of mirex in Lake Ontario	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Mirex is a toxic, hydrophobic pollutant in Lake Ontario that undergoes an indirect photoreaction mediated by natural dissolved organic matter. The monohydro product photomirex further photolyzes to form a dihydro product. The efficiency of mirex photolysis was determined as wavelength-dependent reaction quantum yield coefficients. Quantum yield coefficients were determined for 14 lake samples collected from multiple locations and over the course of several weeks from one location. Values declined with increasing wavelength, with reactivity extending above 436 nm. Individual samples showed no seasonal trend. Pooled quantum yield coefficients and 95% confidence intervals were calculated by combining the results for all samples. Using the quantum yield coefficients within this confidence interval, mirex photolysis rates were accurately predicted during a sunlight exposure study for an independently collected water sample. In a relative rate experiment, the rate constants for mirex photolysis and subsequent photomirex photolysis were not significantly different from each other at the 95% confidence level, and this finding was further supported by the sunlight exposure results.

J	Clair, TA; Sayer, BG				Clair, TA; Sayer, BG			Environmental variability in the reactivity of freshwater dissolved organic carbon to UV-B	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Reductions in the global stratospheric ozone layer are thought to be increasing the amount of ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation reaching the planet's surface and may be affecting the chemistry of dissolved organic carbon (DOG) in surface waters. We studied the abundance of chromophores in DOC collected in four different aquatic environments in southwestern Nova Scotia using C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (C-13 NMR) spectroscopy. We showed a clear seasonal pattern in the distribution of structural carbon related to light-sensitive chromophores. There seemed to be little variation in the UV-B related chemical structure of DOC between lakes and streams, though water from a bog pool showed large differences from the other samples. These patterns of potential UV-B reactivity tend to be dampened however, by variations in DOC concentrations which also occur seasonally.																			0168-2563					JAN	1997	36	1					89	97		10.1023/A:1005735929568	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1005735929568													WOS:A1997WJ05100006

This study investigated the spatial-temporal patterns of MeHg and OM in the Yellow River, through collecting water and sediment samples within the dry and wet seasons and human-induced water-sediment regulation scheme (WSRS) event. During the wet season, the river water was characterized by terrigenous OM, high unfiltered MeHg (UMeHg) concentration (206 f 83.6 pg/L), and a low UMeHg percentage in unfiltered total Hg (UTHg) (UMeHg/UTHg = 0.37 f 0.18 %). These findings may suggest that MeHg in the wet season was likely produced in the catchment and imported into the river. In contrast, autochthonous OM predominated during the dry season, probably enhancing in situ MeHg production (UMeHg/UTHg = 1.01 f 0.50 %), although UMeHg concentration was lower (81.8 f 25.5 pg/L) due to obviously reduced external inputs. The WSRS dramatically increased water MeHg contents (589 f 116 pg/L) and UMeHg/UTHg ratios (0.78 f 0.16 %) probably through direct inputs of upstream reservoirs' MeHg and resuspension of downstream sediments. Exploring the effects of OM on sediment MeHg sources suggested that MeHg in the wet season primarily originated from watershed soil inputs, while in the dry season, it mainly resulted from in situ Hg methylation. However, extremely low total Hg (THg) and MeHg/THg (0.02-0.35 %) indicated that sediment MeHg production may be of minor importance in the Yellow River.

Such an extensive range of applications of azole compounds leads to their widespread occurrence in wastewater and surface waters. In this study, the quantitative determination of antifungal pharmaceuticals (fluconazole, climbazole, clotrimazole) and fungicides (tebuconazole, epoxiconazole, flutriafol, tiabendazole, and imazalil) was seasonally performed in surface water samples from rivers, lakes and field drainage ditches as well as wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) effluents in western Poland. Solid phase extraction (SPE) combined with highperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to detect azole compounds in waters, obtaining recoveries up to 100.2% with relative standard deviations below 9%. Azole monitoring was conducted for 3 years in treated wastewater and surface water. Fluconazole was the compound determined at the highest concentrations in all analyzed WWTP effluents, reaching 739 ng L- 1. The concentration of 100 ng L- 1 was also exceeded by climbazole, clotrimazole, tiabendazole, and imazalil, which proves that these compounds are not completely removed by the degradation processes used in WWTPs and are released into the environment. In surface waters analysis, definitely the highest concentration was obtained for tebuconazole - 1383 ng L- 1 in Warta River and 1783 ng L- 1 in a field drainage ditch, which is caused by its extensive application as an agricultural fungicide. The majority of the analyzed azole antifungals are present in WWTP effluents and surface water, highlighting the need for future monitoring and investigation of their degradation methods. However, the present results show that determined concentrations are safe for aquatic organisms.

Because of the high elevation, complex topography, and erratic weather of the Tibetan Plateau, direct measurement of the area of every lake is largely unfeasible. Moreover, complex natural geographic conditions increase the difficulty of image processing and information extraction with remote sensing because they enhance the uncertainty of quantitative data retrieved with satellites. Methods based on spectral features do not generate the expected results of lake area over the Tibetan Plateau due to a lack of distinction between water and other land objects, especially snow, vegetation, and low cloud cover. Therefore, a new method to extract lake area from satellite images in the Tibetan Plateau is needed. In this article, an automatic method was proposed to evaluate lake area during the wet season (from 1 September to 31 October) on the Tibetan Plateau with multi-day Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) remote-sensing images on board the Meteorological Operational satellite-A (MetOp-A) satellite. The method considers both spectral and textural features of lakes and does not need a cloud mask as an input. In addition, the Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering (MTMF) algorithm was applied to decompose the mixed pixels to better identify lakes and estimate the lake area. Based on daily lake identifications, the wet season's lake data were composited with the maximum value composition (MVC) method to determine the lake area. A comparison of our work with the manually interpreted results from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images and observational reports demonstrates the accuracy and reliability of our approach. However, certain factors, i.e. the sensor zenith angle of the polar-orbit satellite and the topography, can affect the lake area extracted from the remote-sensing images.					; Li, Guicai/AAG-4262-2019	ZHENG, Zhaojun/0000-0002-7331-1905; 													0143-1161	1366-5901				AUG 20	2016	37	16					3547	3567		10.1080/01431161.2016.1199062	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2016.1199062													WOS:000381048600001

We conducted microscopic analysis and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR-amplified partial 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes to characterize the plankton community. The clustering of unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) was then used to investigate the similarity of these plankton communities. DGGE fingerprinting revealed that samples collected at the different sites within a season shared high similarity and were generally grouped together. In contrast, we did not observe any seasonal variation based on microscopic analysis. Redundancy analysis (RDA) of the plankton operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in relation to environmental factors revealed that transparency was negatively correlated with the first axis (R=-0.931), and temperature and total phosphorus (TP) were positively correlated with the first axis (R=0.736 and R=0.660, respectively). In conclusion, plankton communities in the artificial lake exhibited significant seasonal variation. Transparency, phosphorus and temperature appear to be the major factors driving the differences in plankton composition.

CHRONOLOGY AND DEVELOPMENT OF JUVENILE BLUEGILL PARASITE COMMUNITIES	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY												This study describes the parasite communities of juvenile bluegill and examines the development of parasite communities in juvenile bluegill from 2 Michigan lakes. Parasitological examination of 510 juvenile bluegill from 2 Michigan lakes (Three Lakes 11 [TL] and Gull Lake [GL]) demonstrated that TL bluegill harbored 19 parasite species and GL bluegill harbored 16 parasite species. Parasite communities of juvenile bluegill from both lakes were dominated by larval parasites, particularly larval trematodes. A nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis showed bluegill of similar lengths to have similar parasite communities. Relative influences of species richness on parasite infracommunities of juvenile bluegill suggest similar patterns of parasite community structure between TL and GL. Patterns in parasite colonization evident in both lakes suggest that the smallest juvenile bluegill are primarily vulnerable to colonization by parasites acquired through direct contact, particularly larval trematodes, while the majority of parasites acquired through ingestion are not acquired until juvenile bluegill are larger and less-gape limited.

International Journal for Parasitology 24: 109-118. A total of 526 Atlantic salmon and 500 brown trout from a fish farm were studied for parasites, as were 272 roach, 251 perch and 150 whitefish from the lake which formed the water source, and 196 roach and 136 perch from the effluent recipient lake. The cultured fish harboured 14 parasite species, of which most were protozoan generalist parasites. Nine species were found on salmon and 12 on brown trout. Epizootically the most important species were Ichthyobodo necator, Chilodonella cyprini and Ichthyophthirius multifiliis. The mean number of species per studied fish was 0.71 for salmon and 0.61 for brown trout. The seasonal occurences of the ectoparasites were found to be irregular due to preventative bathing of the fish. The wild whitefish harboured 19 parasite species, roach 41 and perch 33. The proportions of the parasite species common to both wild and cultured fishes were 17% of the species from roach, 36% of those from perch and 47% of the species from whitefish. Jaccard's similarity index, indicating similarities between wild and farmed fish, was highest between whitefish and brown trout. It was concluded that the source of parasites in the fish farm is the water supplying lake, but the farm itself was unlikely to effect the fish parasite fauna of the water recipient lake, although some ectoparasites, which had high prevalences in this lake, could originate from the farm. The high standard of maintenance and hygiene in this farm kept problems caused by parasites under control.																			0020-7519					FEB	1994	24	1					109	118		10.1016/0020-7519(94)90064-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0020-7519(94)90064-7								8021098					WOS:A1994NG78300012
J	Stanic, I; Kajan, K; Selak, L; Orlic, S				Stanic, Ivana; Kajan, Katarina; Selak, Lorena; Orlic, Sandi			Environmental drivers of microbial assembly and stability in lakes across biogeographical regions	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Freshwater lake ecosystems play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, acting as both carbon sinks and sources while providing essential ecosystem services. Within these ecosystems, planktonic microorganisms drive nutrient cycling and energy transfer in aquatic food webs. Due to their rapid response to environmental fluctuations, microbial communities serve as indicators of ecosystem change. In stratified lakes, thermal layering restricts energy and nutrient exchange, creating distinct microbial niches across depths. Microbial communities can be classified into free-living (FL) and particle-associated (PA) bacteria, which exhibit divergent metabolic strategies and responses to environmental change. Ecological theory suggests that PA bacteria are more influenced by deterministic factors (e.g., nutrient availability, oxygen gradients), whereas FL bacteria experience greater stochasticity (e.g., ecological drift). However, the stability and assembly mechanisms of these microbial fractions in dynamic lake environments remain poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed FL and PA bacterial communities in four karstic lakes in Croatia over two years, capturing both stratified and mixed conditions. Our results revealed that stratification and mixing events drove distinct microbial distribution patterns, with environmental gradients shaping niche partitioning between FL and PA bacteria. Contrary to the ecological theory, deterministic processes dominated community assembly in all lakes and fractions, though stochastic processes played a role, particularly in PA communities. Lakes with more stable conditions, such as Plitvice Lakes, exhibited resilient microbial networks, while more dynamic environments, like Bac<acute accent>ina Lakes, supported less stable communities. In Lake Crnis'evo, seasonal salinity fluctuations created strong selection pressures, contributing to community divergence over time. These findings underscore the importance of environmental drivers in shaping microbial assembly and stability, highlighting the distinct ecological roles of FL and PA bacteria. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for predicting microbial responses to environmental change and enhancing biomonitoring strategies for freshwater ecosystem management.

This paper presents the life cycle of this species in eight North American populations in lakes from 42degrees to 69degrees N. Five of the populations had life cycles showing a combination of a one and two year cycle. Two populations had a 1-year cycle, and the southernmost had a combination of a 0.5-year and a 1-year cycle. Lengths of cycles increased with latitude and thus inversely with the temperature. Populations in all lakes were divided into a direct and a delayed line of development. Diapause was not documented in any of the lakes.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2004	529	1					37	48																WOS:000225042200004
J	Jedrysek, MO				Jedrysek, MO			Spatial and temporal patterns in diurnal variations of carbon isotope ratios of early-diagenetic methane from freshwater sediments	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY					Symposium 18 on Global Carbon Cycle, at the 9th Biannual Meeting of the European-Union-of-Geosciences	MAR 23-27, 1997	STRASBOURG, FRANCE	European Union Geosci				Methane was collected from the sediments of two freshwater lakes in SW Poland, Lake Sulistrowiczki and Lake Nowa Cerekiew, on three separate occasions in 1994, 1995, and 1997. Samples were collected from sediments at various shallow depths in the lakes (0.15 to 0.8 m) over the course of the day, and analyzed for carbon isotope ratios. A diurnal variation in the carbon isotopic composition of the methane was evidenced by changes in delta(13)C ratios of up to 14.5 parts per thousand, with the most C-13-depleted gases collected at night and the least C-13-depleted gases collected in the early afternoon. The magnitude of the diurnal variation decreases with increasing water column depth as well as with a decrease in the period of daylight. The lowest delta(13)C values are believed to result from increased production of methane from carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The highest delta(13)C values are believed to occur when the pool of carbon dioxide available as a substrate is most enriched in C-13 and when acetic acid fermentation becomes a more important methanogenic pathway. The observed changes in diurnal carbon isotope composition suggest that increased photosynthetic activity accompanied by carbon dioxide exchange between the sediment pore waters, overlying water column, and the atmosphere are more important factors than variations in temperature or oxidation of methane. Seasonal variations in the carbon isotopic composition of sediment methane and seasonal variations in the magnitude of the observed diurnal variation in isotopic composition may be related to changes in the light/dark cycle and latitude. However, the observed magnitudes of the diurnal variations are as large or larger than the seasonal changes and/or spatial variability that have previously been reported for the carbon isotopic composition of methane from wetlands. Thus, existing isotopic data on biogenic methanogenesis may need to be re-evaluated in light of such diurnal variations. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

VALLISNERIA AMERICANA MICHX	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE												American wild celery (Vallisneria americana Michx.) is a native submerged aquatic plant that differs from other ribbon-leaved aquatics in having leaves with a well-defined midvein and paler zones on either side of a central dark band. In southern Ontario and Quebec the dense leaf growth, and in particular the floating plants dislodged from the sediment, impede water traffic and restrict water-based recreation. Mechanical harvesting may be the best method of control in most situations. American wild celery is beneficial as an important food source for waterfowl and other wildlife, as cover and spawning area for fish, and may also be used as fertilizer and to feed livestock. There is also potential for increased use in biomonitoring. Widespread in eastern North America, it reaches its northern limit in southeastern Canada. It is introduced in British Columbia and the northwestern United States, and has also recently been reported from the southwestern United States, Mexico, the Carribean islands, northern Central America, southeast Asia and Australia. American wild celery occurs in alkaline to slightly saline waters with pH > 6, at depths of 0.3-7 m, and in a variety of sediment types. Clonal growth is extensive. Parent rosettes can each produce 20 or more new shoots within a season. These develop from buds at the tip of stolons, some of which overwinter as turions. Pollination takes place on the surface of the water with free-floating male flowers tipping into the surface depression created by the larger, attached female flowers. Fruits mature under the water.																			0008-4220					OCT	1994	74	4					883	897		10.4141/cjps94-160	http://dx.doi.org/10.4141/cjps94-160													WOS:A1994PV38000040

Water samples from three recreational lakes and a reference reservoir were collected in April and July from both surface and water column layers were analysed to quantify OUVFs concentrations and calculate aquatic risk quotients (RQs). Our results revealed a clear seasonal pattern, with significantly higher OUVF concentrations in July, particularly at Kryspino<acute accent>w reservoir, coinciding with peak tourist activity. IAMC, HMS, and BMDBM were the main contributors to moderate cumulative risk values with localized high-risk values at Kryspino<acute accent>w, while the reference site exhibited consistently low contamination and negligible risks.

However, the microbial food web (MFW) of coexisting water and sediment in wetland ecosystems and their responses to environmental changes remain unclear. In this study, we investigated MFWs (including archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes) across 21 paired samples from alpine wetlands on the Tibetan Plateau along a salinity gradient. In both water and sediment, the MFWs exhibited enhanced predation and decreased mutualism with increasing salinity, with the total trophic transfer efficiency (TTE) community of bacteria, protists and metazoa increasing. The TTE of MFWs in sediment was higher than that in water, and the competition associations among species decreased while the cooperation associations increased. Compared to sediment, the MFWs in water were more complex and vulnerable. Salinity exerted top-down control on MFWs by directly influencing higher trophic levels (e.g., metazoa) in water. In contrast, salinity affected the MFWs through bottom-up effects by impacting lower trophic levels (heterotrophic archaea, heterotrophic bacteria) in sediment. Overall, this study provides new insights into understanding the trophic cycle and interactions of multi-trophic biological communities in coexisting water and sediment, and how MFWs adapt to environmental change.

Surface meltwater features such as supraglacial lakes (SGLs), channels and slush are becoming more abundant as a result of the former and are implicated as a control on the latter when they drain. It is not yet clear, however, how these different surface hydrological features will respond to future climate changes, and it is likely that GrIS surface melting will continue to increase as the Arctic warms. Here, we use Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 optical satellite imagery to compare the distribution and evolution of meltwater features (SGLs, channels, slush) in the Russell-Leverett glacier catchment, southwest Greenland, in relatively high (2019) and low (2018) melt years. We show that (1) supraglacial meltwater covers a greater area and extends further inland to higher elevations in 2019 than in 2018; (2) slush - generally disregarded in previous Greenland surface hydrology studies - is far more widespread in 2019 than in 2018; (3) the supraglacial channel system is more interconnected in 2019 than in 2018; (4) a greater number and larger total area of SGLs drained in 2019, although draining SGLs were, on average, deeper and more voluminous in 2018; (5) small SGLs (<= 0.0495 km2) - typically disregarded in previous studies - form and drain in both melt years, although this behaviour is more prevalent in 2019; and (6) a greater proportion of SGLs refroze in 2018 compared to 2019. This analysis provides new insight into how the ice sheet responds to significant melt events, and how a changing climate may impact meltwater feature characteristics, SGL behaviour and ice dynamics in the future.

Shajedul; Lin, Yuh-Lang			Urban Impacts on Convective Squall Lines over Chicago in the Warm Season-Part I: Observations of Multi-Scale Convective Evolution	ATMOSPHERE												In this study, our aim is to diagnose how two quasi-linear convective systems (QLCS) are organized so one can determine the possible role of the city of Chicago, IL, USA, in modifying convective precipitation systems. In this Part I of a two-part study, we employ large-scale analyses, radiosonde soundings, surface observations, and Doppler radar data to diagnose the precursor atmospheric circulations that organize the evolution of two mesoscale convective systems and compare those circulations to radar and precipitation. Several multi-scale processes are found that organize and modify convection over the Chicago metroplex. Two sequential quasi-linear convective systems (QLCS #1 and #2) were organized that propagated over Chicago, IL, USA, during an eight-hour period on 5-6 July 2018. The first squall line (QLCS #1) built from the southwest to the northeast while strengthening as it propagated over the city, and the second (QLCS #2) propagated southeastwards and weakened as it passed over the city in association with a polar cold front. The weak upper-level divergence associated with a diffluent flow poleward of an expansive ridge built over and strengthened a low-level trough and confluence zone, triggering QLCS #1. Convective downdrafts from QLCS #1 produced a cold pool that interacted with multiple confluent low-level jets surrounding and focused on the metroplex urban heat island, thus advecting the convection poleward over the metroplex. The heaviest precipitation occurred just south-southeast of Midway Airport, Chicago. Subsequently, a polar cold front propagated into the metroplex, which triggered QLCS #2. However, the descending air above it under the polar jet and residual cold pool from QLCS #1 rapidly dissipated the cold frontal convection. This represents a case study where very active convection built over the metroplex and was likely modified by it, as evidenced in numerical simulations to be described in Part II.																				2073-4433				MAR 6	2025	16	3							306	10.3390/atmos16030306	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos16030306													WOS:001453486700001

This paper presents a systematic method for researching geohazard, from regional to individual scale. The methodology includes the establishment of geological chain inventories, discrimination of geohazard chain modes, analyses of dynamics and dam breaches, and risk assessments. The following results were obtained: (1) In the downstream of Yarlung Zangbo River, 175 sites were identified as high-risk for river blockage disasters, indicating the development of watershed geohazards. Five geohazard chain modes were summarized by incorporating geomorphological characteristics, historical events, landslide zoning, and materials. The risk areas of typical hazard were identified and assessed using InSAR data. (2) Glacier-related watershed geohazard chains are significantly different from traditional landslides. A detailed inversion analysis was conducted on the massive rock-ice avalanche in the Sedongpu gully in 2021. This particular event lasted roughly 300 seconds, with a maximum flow velocity of 77.2 m/s and a maximum flow height of 93 meters. By scrutinizing the dynamic processes and mechanical characteristics, mobility stages and phase transitions can be divided into four stages. (3) Watershed geohazard chains tend to block rivers. The peak breach discharge of the Yigong Landslide reached 12.4 x 104 m3/s, which is 36 times the volume of the seasonal flood discharge in the Yigong River. Megafloods caused by landslide dam breaches have significantly shaped the geomorphology. This study offers insights into disaster patterns and the multi-staged movement characteristics of glacier-related watershed geohazard chains, providing a comprehensive method for investigations and assessments in glacial regions.					高, 高杨/JVZ-9679-2024; Gao, Shaohua/GMW-8830-2022														1674-487X	1867-111X				JUN	2025	36	3					1181	1197		10.1007/s12583-024-0116-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12583-024-0116-y		MAR 2025											WOS:001436034600001
J	Graham, S; Turkington, R				Graham, S; Turkington, R			Population dynamics response of Lupinus arcticus to fertilization, clipping, and neighbour removal in the understory of the boreal forest	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												A demographic study was conducted on field populations of Lupinus arcticus S. Wats. growing in the understory of a white spruce dominated forest, near Kluane Lake, Yukon. The relative effects of soil fertility level, neighbours, and herbivory were assessed using a factorial experiment of +/- fertilizer (N-P-K), +/- neighbour removal, and +/- clipping. We monitored the dynamics of leaves and collected data on reproduction, survival, and size for two growing seasons. Fertilizing increased the incidence of disease on leaves and reduced reproductive efficiency. Clipping reduced leaf cohort survivorship, total leaf density, and the incidence of disease on leaves. Removing neighbours increased the percent cover of L. arcticus and decreased total leaf mortality. Treatments had no effect on the survival of leaves in early cohorts. Although there were some significant responses to treatments, the overall tendency was a lack of response, especially pertaining to leaf population dynamics. This low response to the treatments imposed is consistent with the argument that plants growing in low productivity, infrequently disturbed habitats should show little response to short-term changes in local environmental conditions. The results are also consistent with suggestions that plants in moderately stressed habitats should be more adapted to withstand grazing than competition.																			0008-4026					JUN	2000	78	6					753	758		10.1139/b00-039	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b00-039													WOS:000088272000006

This study provides a comprehensive and sequential approach for the reconstruction of groundwater level data near Lake Uluabat in Bursa, Turkey. This study addresses missing data reconstruction for both past and future events using the Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR) model. The reconstruction process is evaluated through model calibration metrics and changes in the statistical properties of the observed and reconstructed time series. To achieve this goal, the groundwater time series from two observational wells and lake water levels during the January 2004 to September 2019 period are used. The lake water level, the definition of the four seasons via the application of three dummy variables, and time are used as inputs in the prediction of groundwater levels in observation wells. The optimal GBR model calibration is achieved by training the dataset selected based on data gaps in the time series, while test-past and test-future datasets are used for model validation. Afterward, the GBR models are used in reconstructing the missing data both in the pre- and post-training data sets, and the performance of the models are evaluated via the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), Root Mean Square Percentage Error (RMSPE) and Performance Index (PI). The statistical properties of the time series including the probability distribution, maxima, minima, quartiles (Q1-Q3), standard error (SE), coefficient of variation (CV), entropy (H), and error propagation are also measured. It was concluded that GBR provides a good base for missing data reconstruction (the best performance was as high as NSE: 0.99, RMSPE: 0.36, and PI: 1.002). In particular, the standard error and the entropy of the system in one case, respectively, experienced a 53% and 35% rise, which was found to be tolerable and negligible.

This study evaluates how well solar radiation (Ra) and temperature data from reanalysis/ satellite measurements perform to anticipate lake evaporation on a daily and seasonal basis. The approach evaluates the effectiveness of five Machine Learning algorithms under three input scenarios at three meteorological stations in the Awash basin, Ethiopia: Gradient Boosting (GB), Random forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and multilayer perceptron (MLP). XGBoost performs exceptionally well on the training set in each of the three scenarios. GB and MLP performs well throughout the test set for all three input scenarios. Subsequently, when employing models in the Metehara, Melkasa, and Dubti stations, IS1 is the best scenario for RMSE, NSE, and KGE. Consequently, the model predicts encouraging outcomes for each location over the Tseday and Kiremit seasons. The outcomes of the study suggest that identifying the best representative satellite/reanalysis data of temperature and solar radiation for particular areas can lead to effective performance. This investigation provides insight for simulating a reservoir's existing operating system.

To enhance fisheries resources of this catadromous fish, eel stocking programs are conducted annually in many rivers across Japan. These programs involve capturing naturally recruited glass eels at river mouths, farming them in artificial ponds and releasing them into rivers. However, the impact of these stocking efforts on eel populations remains unclear. Recently, environmental DNA (eDNA) has emerged as an effective tool for assessing the biomass of target species in aquatic environments. This study aims to evaluate the spatiotemporal changes in Japanese eel population over 3 years and the effect of stocking using species-specific eDNA marker in the Shigenobu River system in western Japan, where numerous sediment-control dams and weirs are present, and eel stocking is conducted both upstream and downstream of these barriers. Our results show that eDNA concentration was significantly correlated with both the density and biomass of captured eels, confirming the effectiveness of eDNA assays for eel stock assessment. eDNA concentrations, as well as captured density and biomass, were higher downstream than upstream. After stocking, eDNA concentrations increased and remained elevated at upstream stocking sites where natural recruitment was blocked by sediment-control dams. Seasonal variation in eDNA concentrations was most pronounced downstream, where natural recruitment occurs. These findings suggest that stocking enhances eel populations in areas where natural recruitment is restricted, but the effect is modest compared to natural recruitment. Therefore, ecosystem-based habitat management, including habitat restoration and connectivity, should be prioritized for eel conservation.																			1052-7613	1099-0755				MAR	2025	35	3							e70096	10.1002/aqc.70096	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.70096													WOS:001437354300001
J	Matsumoto, H; Nakayama, K				Matsumoto, Hiroki; Nakayama, Keisuke			Validity of theoretical solutions for a rotating rectangular basin with two-layer stratification due to a suddenly imposed wind	PHYSICS OF FLUIDS												In 1974, Csanady and Scott developed theoretical solutions for the flow fields and displacements of a density interface in a rectangular basin with two-layer stratification when a constant wind stress was suddenly imposed. However, their solutions do not satisfy all boundary conditions. In the present study, we have corrected these theoretical solutions and have analyzed their validity by comparing them with numerical simulations. We found that the theoretical solutions have high validity when upwelling does not occur and when nonlinear effects, vertical circulation, and boundary layer effects are small. In addition, we found that the Wedderburn number WN is more significant for the validity and applicability of the theoretical solutions than the Burger number S-i. Furthermore, the theoretical solutions are highly applicable to actual phenomena when W-N >= 1.98. (C) 2025 Author(s).

A field study was conducted to reduce the abundance of the P. clarkii population through intensive trapping activities and improve the effectiveness of catches using three different types of traps: two wire mesh traps (cylindrical and rectangular) and artificial refuge traps. The study also aimed at assessing the composition of the lake animal community, particularly the presence of crayfish predators (using eDNA), and the potential spread of P. clarkii outside the lake. The control activities conducted over two trapping seasons in 2022-2023 led to a decrease of at least 50% in the abundance index (Catch Per Unit Effort) of the crayfish population. Cylindrical traps caught more individuals, especially larger ones and males, with artificial refuge traps capturing relatively more females and smaller individuals. eDNA sampling highlighted the presence of a diversified community, mainly composed of alien species, and some crayfish predators (e.g. fish). The surveys conducted in the surrounding areas revealed the presence of P. clarkii downstream of the lake. Control activities using different types of traps should be maintained to decrease further the P. clarkii population abundance, while additional management activities should be carried out to halt the spread of the species outside the lake in order to prevent its further ecological impacts.

Additionally, water hyacinth poses a major threat to Tana Lake by disrupting ecosystems and degrading water quality. A field experiment conducted in the Lake Tana Basin during the 2022/2023 cropping season aimed to assess the impact of combining water hyacinth compost and blended mineral fertilizer on soil properties and wheat yield attributes. Methods The study tested four rates of water hyacinth compost (0, 5, 10, 15 t ha(-)(1)) and four rates of blended mineral fertilizer (0%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of NPSB recommended rates) in a randomized complete block design with triplicates. Data on soil properties and wheat yield were analyzed using SAS-JMP17 software. Results The combined application of both fertilizers significantly (p < 0.05) improved the total nitrogen and agronomic attributes of wheat. The highest total nitrogen was achieved with 15 t ha(-)(1) of compost and full-rate blended fertilizer, while the highest soil reaction, organic carbon, and cation exchange capacity were observed with 15 t ha(-)(1) compost alone. The best wheat yield (4.15 t ha(-)(1)) and net benefit (131,912.73 ETB ha(-)(1)) were obtained with 15 t ha(-)(1) compost and full-rate blended fertilizer. Grain yield increased by 312.35% and 28.09% compared to the control and blanket recommendation of blended mineral fertilizer. Conclusions Using 15 t ha(-)(1) of compost with the full recommended rate of blended fertilizer enhances wheat production and provides a sustainable solution for managing invasive water hyacinth in similar regions.

The Branched GDGT Isomer Ratio Refines Lacustrine Paleotemperature Estimates	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) are membrane-spanning lipids synthesized by bacteria in numerous substrates. The degree of methylation of the five methyl brGDGTs in both soils and lake sediments, described by the MBT '(5Me) index, is empirically related to surface atmospheric temperature. This relationship in lakes is generally assumed to reflect lake surface temperatures captured by brGDGT production in the water column and exported to lake sediments, and the MBT '(5Me) index has been applied to brGDGTs in lake sediment successions to reconstruct changes in temperature through time. We analyzed the relationship between MBT '(5Me) and the isomerization of brGDGTs (IR6Me) in globally distributed surficial lake sediments and demonstrated that the relationship, and calibrations, of MBT '(5Me) and temperature in middle and high latitude lakes are sensitive to incompletely understood factors related to IR6Me. IR6Me does not appear to track a non-thermal influence of brGDGT methylation in tropical lakes, but this could change as the data set is expanded. We address ongoing challenges in the application of the MBT '(5Me) paleothermometer in middle and high latitude lakes with new MBT '(5Me)-temperature calibrations based on grouping lakes by IR6Me. We demonstrate how IR6Me can distinguish samples with a significant non-thermal influence on MBT '(5Me) by targeting anomalously warm temperatures during the Last Glacial Maximum from newly analyzed piston and gravity core samples from Lake Baikal, Russia.

Turbidity is an indicator that fluctuates dramatically with changes in wind and is affected not only by the instantaneous wind speed but also by the wind direction, duration, etc. The Weibull distribution was introduced to describe the distributions of the wind conditions and turbidity during a seasonal period. The relationship between the mean wind-power density and the corresponding turbidity reached 0.8, which showed a relatively strong correlation. A turbidity prediction model was built by the random forest algorithm and was fed with the mean wind-power density and temperature. The results indicated that nearly half of the test samples had REs less than 20%, which was enough for waterworks to adjust the dosage in advance. The findings can be used to develop turbidity prediction models using meteorological forecast data and provide a reference for waterworks with shallow lakes as sources.

However, the effects of BCP on the fate of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) and its role in regulating eutrophication within river-reservoir systems, remains insufficiently understood, particularly across different geological settings. We investigated the Hongfeng Reservoir (HFR), a typical karst reservoir, analyzing water chemistry, nutrient concentrations, and stable isotopes of dissolved inorganic carbon (delta 13CDIC) and nitrate (delta 15N-NO3 -) to uncover the underlying mechanisms governing the migration of biogenic elements and the process of eutrophication. Our findings reveal a strong BCP effect in the reservoirs that leads to substantial CO2 and HCO3- uptake via phytoplankton photosynthesis during the warm-wet season, resulting in decreased dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations and increased pH in the epilimnion. The delta 13CDIC (-4.0 +/- 0.5 %o) values in the epilimnion relatively increased in response to phytoplankton photosynthesis that preferentially absorbs the lighter isotope of 12C. Compared with the inflow, the delta 15N-NO3 - (7.4 +/- 0.2 %o) in the epilimnion of the reservoir is significantly depleted, with the water predominantly aerobic or oxygen-supersaturated. This suggests that nitrification is the dominant process during the warm-wet season. The high NO3 - concentrations (44.3 +/- 10.1 mu mol/L) indicate a sufficient N supply for biological uptake. The strong BCP effects in the epilimnion convert substantial amounts of DCO2 and nutrients into autochthonous organic matter. The resulting increase in pH further reduces the availability of DCO2. Furthermore, BCP-induced calcium carbonate precipitation enhances P removal through co-precipitation, thereby accelerating nutrient depletion and carbon sequestration, which collectively contribute to the mitigation of eutrophication risks. To assess the broader applicability of these findings, we analyzed data from 129 lakes and reservoirs globally. Our results show that karst reservoirs, with their strong BCP effect, exhibit an average Carlson trophic status index (CTSI) 9.8 % lower than non-karst reservoirs, indicating a reduced risk of eutrophication. These insights offer valuable implications for the management of water resources in karstic reservoirs globally.

Nevertheless, efforts made to trace the Rusizi flow into the lake have failed. Ten sampling surveys were carried out from March 1994 to July 1995. Each consisted of 22 samples, at different distances off the Rusizi estuary and at different depths. Eighteen physical and chemical variables were studied at each site. The Rusizi water was always denser (800 - 1400 g m(-3)) than the lake water. The relative importance of temperature, suspended solids and salinity varied seasonally. A descent of the Rusizi inflow was observed. Close to the river estuary, river and lake waters mixed and Rusizi sediments settled. Complete mixing occurred within 800 m offshore. The Rusizi inflow merged with the epilimnion rather than the hypolimnion. Horizontal spread by shorebound currents seemed to be more important than offshore spread.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL	1999	407						65	73		10.1023/A:1003701901217	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003701901217													WOS:000083710100007

Chemical properties (octanol-water partition coefficients) suggest that the coplanar congeners may accumulate in organisms to a greater extent than homologs with greater ortho substitution. We analyzed a set of 65 PCB congeners with zero to four or rho-chlorines from seven homolog groups in water, suspended particulate matter, and zebra mussels from Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA, on four dates throughout the ice-free season. The suspended particulate matter was separated by size and characterized as phytoplankton or zooplankton using diagnostic carotenoid pigments and light microscopy. Median bioconcentration factors (BCFs) for accumulation from water by phytoplankton and bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) for accumulation from water plus food by zooplankton and zebra mussels ranged from 1 x 10(4) to 1 x 10(6) and were generally the greatest for the tetra- to heptachlorobiphenyls. The average coplanar congener BCFs and BAFs fur accumulation from water by phytoplankton. zooplankton, and zebra mussels for the tri-, tetra-, and pentachlorobiphenyls were 54% larger than corresponding values for their homologs. Biomagnification factors (BMFs) of the tetra-, penta-, and hexachlorobiphenyls between zooplankton and zebra mussels and their food source, phytoplankton, typically ranged between 1 and 10, but the average coplanar congener BMFs were 25% less than values for their corresponding homologs. The tendency for coplanar congeners to accumulate to a lesser extent between trophic levels was not as large as their tendency to accumulate from water to a greater extent. Based on accumulation factors, we conclude that the dioxin-like tetra- and pentachlorobiphenyls generally accumulate in the phytoplankton, zooplankton, and zebra mussels of the Green Bay ecosystem to a greater extent than other congeners. Fugacity ratios suggest that, in phytoplankton and zooplankton, homolog concentrations were below equilibrium with water throughout the held season, particularly for the more chlorinated groups, but that concentrations in zebra mussels were at or above equilibrium with water.																			0730-7268	1552-8618				JUL	1999	18	7					1380	1389		10.1002/etc.5620180706	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620180706													WOS:000081021400006

N-2-fixing cyanobacteria were present in all the samples analyzed (25 sampling points sampled three times per year during two years). The relative cyanobacterial abundance in soil and water followed contrasting patterns, maximum presence in soil coincided with minimum abundance in water. Correlation analysis showed that cyanobacterial abundance in the two phases (water and sediment) was influenced more by water than by soil properties. Salinity, mineralization variables, and soluble reactive phosphate (SRP) correlated positively with heterocystous cyanobacteria presence. Furthermore, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and the ratio DIN:SRP correlated negatively with cyanobacterial abundance. However DIN:SRP ratio better described the cyanobacterial distribution, with a threshold effect: below the Redfield ratio value (7.2 in mass units) cyanobacterial abundance was clearly higher.

The restoration of submerged vegetation has emerged as a promising area of lake ecosystem research and is recognized as an effective method for managing eutrophic lakes. However, the validity of previous findings may be compromised by artificial experimental conditions and the brief duration of the studies, potentially underestimating the long-term effectiveness of submerged plants in restoring eutrophic lakes.MethodsWe restored a eutrophic lake through the reconstruction of submerged vegetation. Continuous sampling and monitoring of lake water and sediments were conducted throughout the project. By analyzing the spatiotemporal variations and factors driving nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the overlying water and sediments, we explored the effects of the restoration of submerged vegetation on nitrogen and phosphorus loading in the sediment-water system.ResultsThe restoration of submerged vegetation significantly improved the environmental conditions in overlying water in the lake by increasing transparency and dissolved oxygen levels while reducing nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. Moreover, throughout their growth period, submerged plants could significantly reduce nitrogen and phosphorus loads in surface sediments (0-5 cm), particularly the concentrations of organic nitrogen (ON), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), Ca-bound P (Ca-P), and P bound to Fe, Al and Mn oxides and hydroxides (Fe-P).ConclusionOur findings suggest that the restoration of submerged vegetation effectively controlled the nutrient loads of nitrogen and phosphorus in the overlying water and sediments of the lake. To further stabilize and extend the function of submerged plants in controlling internal nutrients and purifying water quality, it is necessary to strengthen the construction of a multi-seasonal and age-structured submerged plant community to promote the benign cycle of the lake ecosystem.					wang, gulin/NGS-0457-2025; Xu, Xinwei/AAV-7391-2020; Yu, Weicheng/JPA-1655-2023														0032-079X	1573-5036				2025 FEB 26	2025										10.1007/s11104-025-07321-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-025-07321-w		FEB 2025											WOS:001432581000001
J	Comín, FA; Cabrera, M; Rodó, X				Comín, FA; Cabrera, M; Rodó, X			Saline lakes:: integrating ecology into their management future	HYDROBIOLOGIA					Conference on Hydrobiologia	MAR, 1996	UNIV LEICESTER, LEICESTER, ENGLAND		UNIV LEICESTER			Defining the key temporal scales of variability in ecological processes is fundamental to saline lake management because the physical, chemical and biological characteristics of saline lakes undergo fluctuations at different time scales, compared to those of freshwater lakes. A long-term study of Lake Gallocanta (25 km(2) area inland saline lake in NE Spain) provides the ecological basis for its management. The coupling of the administrative framework with its ecological processes is examined. Limnological and climatological parameters were measured using standard methods during 1977-1995. Complete desiccation of the lake occurred in 1983-86 and in 1994-95. Water level fluctuations were strongly correlated with meteorological events, particularly rainfall for seasonal and decadal time scales. The relationship between salinity and water volume follows the typical model described for playa lakes. However, the intensity and frequency of the salinity and water volume fluctuations in Lake Gallocanta also change over time. Most species show pulsing population dynamics at the larger time scales (annual, decadal). However, many of these show a continuous population development at shorter time scales. Examples are provided for several phytoplankton and zooplankton species. Fluctuations in water level also influence phyto and zooplankton community structure. The combination of the number of species, S, and the number of individuals, N, as K=log S/log N indicates that the community structure also fluctuates at different time scales. Most of the present laws established for the management of saline lakes are centered on the conservation of waterfowl. Although some generic laws attempt to preserve the overall natural ecosystem, only those dealing with the protection of wild flora and fauna, and threatened species, are implemented. However, ecological knowledge now suggests that the major objective for the conservation of saline lakes should be to preserve the fluctuation of the hydrological balance, avoiding groundwater extraction in the catchment area and surface water. Generic laws regulate water use in Spain and in many other countries. These laws are not useful for saline lake management because they do not offer solutions to the frequent conflicts arising between the water demand for intensive agriculture and nature conservation, which are common in the semi-arid zones where saline lakes are located. Integrated management of the land and water resources in the catchment area is required to preserve saline lake characteistics. Recent legislation aims to promote such management. A model of conservation and development of the overall ecosystem is presented.

J	Grand, JB; Flint, PL; Heglund, PJ				Grand, JB; Flint, PL; Heglund, PJ			Habitat use by nesting and brood rearing northern pintails on the Yukon-Kuskokwim delta, Alaska	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												We studied habitat use by nesting and brood-rearing northern pintails (Anas acuta) on the coastal Yukon-Kuskokwin (Y-K) Delta, 1991-93. We used a digital habitat map constructed from color infrared aerial photos to assign habitat types to nest and brood locations and estimate habitat availability. Sixty-nine percent of females nested on slough banks in highly saline, tidally influenced habitats where we observed few mammalian predators. Nesting pintails likely preferred slough banks because they were higher and well drained early in the nesting season. Radiomarked females selected moderately saline habitats that were only occasionally or rarely influenced by tides for brood rearing. Eighty percent of females that nested in saline habitats moved their broods to less saline habitats, and those that nested in preferred brood-rearing habitats never moved to ore saline habitats to rear their broods. Managers should be aware that in coastal wetlands the proximity of good-quality nesting and brood rearing habitats is important, and the distribution of nesting pintails may not reflect the distribution of broods and vice versa.

Reproductive biology of invasive grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) in two North American systems	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) are nonnative, herbivorous freshwater fish that represent an ecological threat in North American waters. However, data are limited on reproductive biology specific to wild populations in midwestern North America, despite recent concern for grass carp establishment within the Great Lakes. Basic information on reproductive traits could be useful to determine reproductive potential, inform future population modelling and provide information to aid control efforts. Our objectives were to evaluate grass carp age-at-maturity, spawning season timing, fecundity type, developmental timing and spawning strategy. Additionally, we evaluated the reliability of the gonadosomatic index (GSI) as a proxy for identifying mature grass carp and compared body condition across study areas. We sampled grass carp in portions of the Mississippi River watershed within the state of Missouri and within the Lake Erie basin. Based on gonad histological samples (n = 274), grass carp are batch spawners with indeterminate fecundity and asynchronous ovarian developmental timing. This allows flexibility in their spawning, exemplified by a protracted spawning season in Lake Erie (April to November) in temperatures ranging from 12.3 to 27.3 degrees C. Minimum observed age-at-maturity for females in Missouri and for both males and females in the Lake Erie population was age-3 and age-2 for males in Missouri. Accuracy of GSI as a measure of maturity during the spawning season was 89.7% and 87.5%, for females and males, respectively. Compared to Missouri, grass carp in Lake Erie had a significantly higher body condition, and females ready to spawn had significantly higher GSI values, suggesting that the grass carp in Lake Erie are healthier and more fecund relative to Missouri and, if left uncontrolled, potentially have a high probability of establishment within the Great Lakes. The results of this study will allow managers to identify the reproductive status of grass carp in the field and more accurately estimate populations and reproductive potential.					; Acre, Matthew/KFQ-2331-2024	Wilson, Tammy/0000-0001-8570-6069; 														1095-8649				JUL	2025	107	1					101	115		10.1111/jfb.70003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.70003		FEB 2025						39996564					WOS:001430296700001

F.; Kyathanahally, Sreenath; Baity-Jesi, Marco; To, Sze-Wing; Merico, Agostino; Pomati, Francesco			Distinct phytoplankton size classes respond differently to biotic and abiotic factors	ISME COMMUNICATIONS												The interplay between abiotic (resource supply, temperature) and biotic (grazing) factors determines growth and loss processes in phytoplankton through resource competition and trophic interactions, which are mediated by morphological traits like size. Here, we study the relative importance of grazers, water physics, and chemistry on the daily net accumulation rates (ARs) of individual phytoplankton from natural communities, grouped into six size classes from circa 10 to 500 mu m. Using a Random Forest modelling approach and 4 years of daily data from a lake, we find that water temperature is generally a pivotal control of all phytoplankton ARs. At the same time, nutrients and light are important for the smallest and the largest classes. Mesozooplankton abundance is a key predictor of the AR for small phytoplankton, with microzooplankton being important for the middle-size range. In our data, large and small phytoplankton have different (seasonal) blooming patterns: small forms are favoured by low temperature and grazing, and high phosphorus levels. Larger forms show positive ARs at high temperatures and low phosphorus (being relatively insensitive to zooplankton grazing). These results help us understand the opportunities and limitations of using size to explain and model phytoplankton responses to biotic and abiotic environmental change.					; Merz, Ewa/HLW-9855-2023; Dennis, Stuart/L-7998-2017; Pomati, Francesco/G-2367-2010; Merico, Agostino/C-1103-2013	pomati, francesco/0000-0002-9746-3735; Eyring, Stefanie/0000-0002-8243-3058; 														2730-6151				FEB 21	2025	5	1							ycae148	10.1093/ismeco/ycae148	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ismeco/ycae148								39991273					WOS:001427074300001
J	Richardson, WB; Bartsch, LA				Richardson, WB; Bartsch, LA			Effects of zebra mussels on food webs: interactions with juvenile bluegill and water residence time	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We evaluated how water residence time mediated the impact of zebra mussels Dreissena polymorpha and bluegill sunfish Lepomis macrochirus on experimental food webs established in 1100-1 outdoor mesocosms. Water residence time was manipulated as a surrogate for seston resupply - a critical variable affecting growth and survival of suspension-feeding invertebrates. We used a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial experimental design with eight treatment combinations (3 replicates/treatment) including the presence or absence of Dreissena (2000 per m(2)), juvenile bluegill (40 per mesocosm), and short (1100 1 per d) or long (220 1 per d) water residence time. Measures of seston concentration (chlorophyll a, turbidity and suspended solids) were greater in the short-compared to long water-residence mesocosms, but intermediate in short water-residence mesocosms containing Dreissena. Abundance of rotifers (Keratella and Polyarthra) was reduced in Dreissena mesocosms and elevated in short residence time mesocosms. Cladocera abundance, in general, was unaffected by the presence of Dreissena; densities were higher in short-residence time mesocosms, and reduced in the presence of Lepomis. The growth of juvenile Lepomis were unaffected by Dreissena because of abundant benthic food. The final total mass of Dreissena was significantly greater in short-than long-residence mesocosms. Impacts of Dreissena on planktonic food webs may not only depend on the density of zebra mussels but also on the residence time of the surrounding water and the resupply of seston.

NITRATE	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Vegetable and citrus production in west-central Florida is reportedly of considerable eutrophication hazard to local groundwater and surface-water bodies, including a 33 000-ha drinking-water supply reservoir (Lake Manatee) near the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Nitrate-N levels were assessed for three vegetable-production seasons during 1990 and 1991 using a combination of multilevel samplers into the shallow (surficial) aquifer beneath selected vegetable fields and citrus groves, coupled with piezometric wells around each field's periphery to assess direction and rate of groundwater flow. The NO3-N concentrations beneath vegetable sites showed sizeable spikes (up to 130 mg L(-1) NO3-N), especially early in the season and at season's end, though almost exclusively at <1-m depth. These concentrations did not persist, however, with the overwhelming majority of samples from most vegetable sites evidencing NO3-N concentrations below 1 mg L(-1). At citrus sites from the same area, NO3-N concentrations in the surficial water table (located 2-4 m below the soil surface in this case) have evidenced high (20-40 mg NO3-N L(-1)) and persistent levels throughout the entire sampling period. This zone of NO3-N enrichment commonly extends 2 to 3 m into the surficial aquifer before NO3-N concentrations decline to <10 mg L(-1) once more. Rates of lateral movement off-site averaged 20 to 40 m yr(-1) for the vegetable sites and 200 to 400 m yr(-1) for the more undulating citrus sites. It is postulated that gaseous dentrification losses naturally remediate the periodic spikes in NO3-N concentrations beneath the vegetable sites because of the high water tables maintained at such locations, whereas denitrification In the deep sands beneath typical citrus sites proceeds much more slowly due to such limitations as a soluble-C energy source and/or a suitable microbial population. The results have implication with respect to shallow water table vs. deeply rooted crop-production systems from the same geographic area, wherever such pairings may occur.

Through three phases of groundwater sample collection from seeps and boreholes, a total of 75 samples were gathered for analysis, including 12 samples containing metals and semi-metals and stable isotopic data (D and O-18), five samples containing C-14 and C-13, and another five samples containing H-3 data. Statistical analysis, as well as a time series of groundwater levels recorded in boreholes and multi-level vibrating wire piezometers, confirmed the multi-layered nature of the aquifer system, which includes at least three to four distinct aquifers. All the samples were saline and brackish water (EC > 4 mS cm(-1)), with a predominant sequence of Cl--SO42--HCO3--NO3-, and Na+-Ca2(+)-Mg2(+)-K+ for anions and cations, respectively. Conservative tracers (Cl, Br, and B) and stable isotopes demonstrated that the Kheirabad Salt Lake (approximate to 13 km north of the mine) is not likely the groundwater source. Radiocarbon and tritium age dating suggest that most of the groundwater in the mining area infiltrated during the Holocene and late Pleistocene epochs (paleowater) rather than being replenished by recent rainfall. However, hydrochemical variations observed in samples collected during the wet season are generally attributed to the mixing of groundwater with surface water infiltrating through fractures around the mine pit.					kalantari, nasrollah/AAI-8903-2021														1025-9112	1616-1068				MAR	2025	44	1					30	54		10.1007/s10230-025-01032-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10230-025-01032-5		FEB 2025											WOS:001427421200001

Variations in the infections of two monogenean species parasitizing the gills of the crucian carp (Carassius carassius), in relation to water temperature over a period of one year in Golbasi Dam Lake, Bursa, Turkey	BULLETIN OF THE EUROPEAN ASSOCIATION OF FISH PATHOLOGISTS												The monogenean fauna on crucian carp, Carassius carassius L., collected from Golbasi Dam Lake during the period from May 2003 to April 2004, were studied to assess the effect of water temperature on parasite prevalence and abundance. A total of 132 fish were studied over a 12-month period. These revealed two species of monogenean Dactylogyrus anchoratus and Gyrodactylus carassii. In terms of seasonal occurrence, Gyrodactylus carassii represented the dominant parasite species being recorded on host gills throughout the year. The total prevalence of infection of G. carassii was 66.7% with the infection rates varying from a peak of 100% in May and June 2003 to a low of 20% in December 2003. Abundance of this species also showed a peak in May-June, followed by a sharp decrease thereafter and a subsequent rise in the following April. Water temperature was an important variable and a significant positive correlation was found between parasite abundance and water temperature. (K-W H=91.001, p < 0.0001). Dactylogyrus anchoratus was recorded in 48 out of 132 fish that were examined (36%). The prevalence levels of this species were somewhat erratic and D. anchoratus infection varied according to the season and reached its highest values in May (100%). The prevalence and abundance of D. anchoratus appeared to be correlated with the water temperature even when it was optimum for D. anchoratus (K-W H=72.917, p < 0.0001). Consequently, the parasite prevalence and abundance appears to be influenced by water temperature.

Hacquet dedicated his research to geology and geomorphology (as we call them now). His most important work "Oryctographia carniolica or Physical (=geological) description of Carniola..." (1778-1789) contains descriptions of rocks, ores, fossils, as well as surface and underground features. In Carniola, karst is prevailing and therefore there is a lengthy description of karst geology and geomorphology included. His classification of mountains specially mentions Mantes secundarii formed by grey limestone. Of surface features dolines, glacio-karstic dolines on high plateaus (with temperature and vegetation inversion), and karst poljes are mentioned. Hacquet presumed the evolution from flooded polje (seasonal lake) to a dry one. To explain the weathering and dissolution of limestone Hacquet took into account the differences between the rock, the exposition and its element content. That is the reason why Gams regarded him as a precursor of a climatic geomorphology and the "father" of corrosion theory. Hacquet has also found the difference between limestone and dolomite. His description of dolomite as Lapis suillus preceded the one of D. Dolomieu for 13 years. Hacquet's statements were not based on observation only, but on the experiment too. When looking upon Hacquet's explanations and results we must not forget that Hacquet's time was still time of parapathetic logic, of four elements and of the principle of burning-the flogiston.																			0583-6050						2006	35	2					163	168																WOS:000246851900015

The sites were selected to represent a gradient of river influence within the broader river mouth area. The area as a whole was found to be rich in nematode diversity, with 106 nematode species identified. The nematode communities recorded ranged in density from 121 to 165 individuals/10 cm(2) and in biomass from 108 to 503 mu g wet weight/10 cm(2). They were also shown to vary in terms of feeding ecology, with significant differences in the proportions of feeding types occurring among site. Deposit feeders were most abundant, followed by chewers, although the latter dominated in terms of biomass. Epistrate feeders were less common and suction feeders rare. The occurrence of epistrate feeders was linked to the concentration of algal pigment, whereas records of deposit feeders and chewers correlated with bacterial density and organic carbon content. The characters of the different nematode communities in the vicinity of the river mouth were found to reflect the transitional nature of the study area.

These measurements represent primarily gaseous elemental mercury (Hg0) taken up by foliage actively during the growing season through stomata. Hg deposition is driven by litterfall mass; thus concentrations are a better indicator of trends. Previous work assessed trends from 2007 to 2014 from 27 locations in the eastern U.S. and found that litterfall total Hg concentrations declined. Here, data from the same area representing 2017 to 2021, 2013 to 2021, and 2007 to 2021 were compiled. For the first two time periods no significant trends in litter concentrations were observed; however, values measured at locations impacted by local/regional sources had higher concentrations and showed increasing trends, but these were not significant. Using all sites for which data were available from 2017 to 2021, total Hg concentration in litterfall for 2017 to 2018 was significantly greater than 2020 to 2021.

To this aim, monthly field surveys were conducted from 2019 to 2021 at 21 sites in Lake Okeechobee, Florida - a large, shallow, eutrophic, and heavily managed lake with coastal connectivity that experiences intense and recurrent HABs. Phytoplankton assemblages were strongly spatially structured forming 7 distinct lake zones with significant dissimilarity in composition and total abundance. While successional patterns were not apparent across seasons or wet/dry periods, total phytoplankton abundance was significantly greater towards the end of the wet season. Distance-based linear models using 16 abiotic variables were used to identify significant explanatory variables of spatial and temporal patterns. The spatial model explained 93% of the variability suggesting deterministic processes largely control spatial patterns. The temporal model explained only 48 % of the temporal variability suggesting stochasticity in lake-wide shifts in assemblages over time. However, the strong spatial structuring of assemblages may preclude lake-wide succession patterns. Total algal abundance metrics were inversely related to nitrate, orthophosphate, and total alkalinity, the strongest explanatory variables of assemblage patterns, suggesting a lag between peak resources and peak abundance as phytoplankton cycle "boom-to-bust" phases. Consistent with this inverse relationship, Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis returned almost exclusively negative responder indicator taxa for all three explanatory variable gradients. The assemblage-level threshold defined the gradient boundary between boom- and bust- associated indicator taxa. These data contribute novel information about HABs ecology pertinent to management strategies.

J	MOL, JH				MOL, JH			ONTOGENIC DIET SHIFTS AND DIET OVERLAP AMONG 3 CLOSELY-RELATED NEOTROPICAL ARMORED CATFISHES	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Analysis of stomach contents of larvae, juveniles and adults of three closely related armoured catfishes in coastal plain swamp of Suriname, South America, revealed major ontogenetic diet shifts. Larvae of Hoplostermum littorale, H. thoracatum and Callichthys callichthys show-ed a restricted diet of rotifers and microcrustacea. Diets of juveniles and adults were more diverse, but large volumes of microcrustacea, aquatic insect larvae and detritus were always present. In all three species diet overlap was especially low between larvae and adults. The proportion of detritus in the stomach was positively related to fish size, which probably reflected the inability of larger size classes to separate effectively benthic invertebrate prey from bottom substrata, and not a specialization towards detritivory. Adults showed only minor seasonality in diet composition, and no effect of season on diet breadth. Interspecific diet overlap among larvae, juveniles and adults did not differ significantly from 1 (complete overlap). Lack of food partitioning was probably related to a similar morphology of the three catfishes. Intraspecific between-size class diet overlap was considerably lower than interspecific within-size class overlap. It is suggested that large interspecific diet overlap occurred because food was not limiting the populations of these catfish. However, the nest habitats of the three species differed.

Based on their attachment patterns, benthic diatoms can be divided into several types according to habitat (i.e., epilithic, epiphytic, and epipelic). Diatoms are often used as ecological indicators due to their sensitivity to environmental changes. However, details concerning the composition, temporal dynamics, and assembly mechanisms of benthic diatom communities in urban wetland habitats remain unclear. In this study, we systematically evaluated the composition and seasonal dynamics of benthic diatoms among three different habitats and validated the applicability of eDNA for studies of diatoms. The relationship between the taxonomic and functional diversity of diatom communities was examined, and the assembly mechanisms of diatom communities were explored. An analysis of 249 benthic diatom samples and 27 water samples from nine sites over eight months revealed differences in the composition of diatom communities among epilithic, epiphytic, and epipelic habitats. In diatoms from different hydrological periods, the contribution of turnover to total taxonomic beta diversity was much larger than that of nestedness, while the nestedness components of functional diversity were comparatively large. Nutrients, total dissolved solids, and water temperature were the main variables that affected the taxonomic and functional beta diversity of the benthic diatom communities. The results suggested that benthic diatom community assembly in the three habitats and eDNA was primarily driven by deterministic processes. This study has demonstrated how habitat preference affects the composition, beta diversity and assembly processes of benthic diatom communities and provided novel insights into the conservation of biodiversity in urban wetlands.																			0013-9351	1096-0953				APR 1	2025	270								121054	10.1016/j.envres.2025.121054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2025.121054		FEB 2025						39922256					WOS:001425690500001

As a result of the induced warming, extreme precipitation, widespread wildfires, and enhanced physical and chemical weathering have been reported from many locations globally. However, the eastern Tethys, a key subtropical site for heat and moisture transport, has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we analyze the stable carbon isotopes of black carbon, a product of incomplete combustion of vegetation or fossil fuels, to assess the role of climate change in driving the perturbation to the organic carbon cycle during the PETM. The carbon isotope excursion documented in black carbon from the sedimentary record of the Kuzigongsu section in the Tarim Basin, eastern Tethys, suggests enhanced mobilization of aged petrogenic organic carbon driven by extreme seasonal precipitation during the PETM. The oxidation of petrogenic organic carbon may have acted as an additional carbon source, contributing to the sustained warming of the PETM.

It gives a practical example of the way seasonal factors can be incorporated into industrial forecasts. Recycled ferrous scrap is a widely traded commodity used in the steel and foundry industries. This paper considers the problems of forecasting scrap prices in the US market. Scrap prices display seasonal behaviour as a result of weather and patterns of industrial production. We consider various ways of modelling this seasonality, use of seasonal vector autoregression, the concept of seasonal integration and the use of dummy variables. A seasonal vector autoregression (VAR) is developed. Here the quarterly series is decomposed into four annual series, one for each quarter. We regress each of these resultant series on its own lags and lags of other series, so developing a periodic autoregressive model. A series of tests enables us to determine the type of seasonality exhibited by the data. The simplest form of seasonal adjustment using seasonal dummy variables turns out to be the best for forecasting US scrap prices. Use of the test procedure suggests that employing seasonal dummies is the correct specification in this case. Inclusion of seasonal effects usually improves the estimation and forecasting performance of time series models. Comparison of a range of alternative forecasting models suggests a periodic autoregression only forecasts satisfactorily in the short run. ARIMA models with seasonal dummies show the best performance. A long lag length is necessary to capture long run cyclical effects.

This lake is under severe anthropogenic pressure and region has a typical Mediterranean climate. Water samples were taken weekly from two stations in littoral and pelagic zones. The temperature, pH and conductivity were measured by a CTD. Chlorophyll-a, NO2-N, NO3-N, NH4-N, SRP and SRSi were analyzed according to the standard methods. Differences among weeks for water quality variables were statistically significant (p < 0.01). Chlorophyll-a showed significant positive linear correlation with temperature, NH4-N and conductivity while NO2-N, NO3-N and TDS were inversely related (p < 0.01). Results show that Seyhan dam has not yet reached the eutraphic stage. Consequently, more extensive studies are needed because the lake is thought to be the most changing site in region as a result of the increasing agricultural, aquacultural and human population. A water quality program should be established to conservation of lake quality.

Possibly 500 yr separated initial scoriaceous ash deposition (ca. 9500 yr ago) and subsequent major lava flows (ca. 9000 yr ago) from Mount Wellington. The local vegetation, topography, and drainage patterns were substantially modified during this time, and damming by the lava flows resulted in the formation of Lake Waiatarua in a shallow valley head ca. 9000 yr ago. Diatom evidence indicates that this lake was initially deep (> 5 m) but was shallowing around 4000 yr ago. In contrast to the Mount Wellington eruptions, tephra deposition resulting from distant rhyolitic volcanic activity of the central North Island and Mayor Island has had little effect on the Auckland vegetation during this time interval (12 000 - 4000 yr ago). Between ca. 12 000 and 10 000 yr ago, conifer-angiosperm forest was the predominant vegetation cover on Auckland Isthmus, but during the early Holocene, forest dominated by Metrosideros expanded, probably on to fresh volcanic surfaces resulting from the Mount Wellington eruptions. At this time, swamp forest communities developed in Waiatarua valley basin, and included species indicative of moist, mild, relatively frost-free climates. Some taxa show histories consistent with other records from the northern New Zealand region, including the rise of Ascarina lucida ca. 11 000 to 9000 yr ago, and its subsequent decline, and the expansion of Agathis australis (kauri) forest communities from ca. 6000 yr ago. Taken together the history of local and regional vegetation points to a mild, moist and weakly seasonal early Holocene climate, which subsequently became drier with greater seasonal temperature extremes.

Sequential extraction protocol was used to fractionate Mn, Cr, Cu, Zn, and Fe to specific phases in sediment and water samples. Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry was used to quantify the metals while physicochemical parameters were determined using standard techniques. Overall mean concentrations of anthropogenic-related metals in sediments for the dry season was highest for Cr (66.7 +/- 3.34 mu gg(-1)) and lowest for Zn (39.6 +/- 1.30 mu gg(-1)), while for the wet season, the mean concentration was highest for Cr (82.3 +/- 6.34 mu gg(-1)) and lowest for Zn (43.1 +/- 4.33 mu gg(-1)). Generally, the metal levels followed the order: Fe > Cr > Cu > Zn > Mn. Physicochemical parameters of the water samples for dry and wet seasons were within the stipulated limit set by regulatory agencies. Speciation results indicated high bioavailability for Cr, Cu, and Zn in water samples while relatively low bioavailability was indicated for all the studied metals in sediment samples. Health risk assessment indicated that water quality was unsuitable for drinking in its present status without further treatment. Results of the pollution load index (PLI) indicated a deterioration level that called for concern in the quality of the river sediments. The results of this study showed that River Sasa was polluted with high bioavailable metals such as Cr, Zn, and Cu in the water which could pose threatening toxicity concerns to plants and animals.

Traditional methods of lake water level monitoring rely heavily on hydrological stations, but there are problems such as regional representativeness, data stability, and high maintenance costs. The satellite altimeter is an essential tool in lake research, with the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) altimeter offering a high spatial resolution. This enables precise and quantitative observations of lake water levels on a large scale. In this study, we used Sentinel-3A SAR Radar Altimeter (SRAL) data to establish a more reasonable lake height inversion algorithm for satellite-derived lake heights. Subsequently, using this technology, a systematic analysis study was conducted with Qinghai Lake as the case study area. By employing regional filtering, threshold filtering, and altimeter range filtering techniques, we obtained effective satellite altimeter height measurements of the lake surface height. To enhance the accuracy of the data, we combined these measurements with GPS buoy-based geoid data from Qinghai Lake, normalizing lake surface height data from different periods and locations to a fixed reference point. A dataset based on SAR altimeter data was then constructed to track lake surface height changes in Qinghai Lake. Using data from the Sentinel-3A altimeter's 067 pass over Qinghai Lake, which has spanned 96 cycles since its launch in 2016, we analyzed over seven years of lake surface height variations. The results show that the lake surface height exhibits distinct seasonal patterns, peaking in September and October and reaching its lowest levels in April and May. From 2016 to 2023, Qinghai Lake showed a general upward trend, with an increase of 2.41 m in lake surface height, corresponding to a rate of 30.0 cm per year. Specifically, from 2016 to 2020, the lake surface height rose at a rate of 47.2 cm per year, while from 2020 to 2022, the height remained relatively stable.

Setbacks in the use of a handaxe: lithic investment and seasonality in the Early Acheulean	ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES												From their first appearance in the archaeological record, the varying degree of biface presence in individual assemblages has long been a notable aspect of discussions surrounding the nature of the Early Acheulean. These debates have largely focused on the relative influence of random processes, site formation dynamics, raw material constraints, biological and/or cultural groupings, and differences in ecology and activity. Here, we collate published technological information from Early Acheulean assemblages 1.8-1.2 Ma, attempting to document patterns of wider inter-assemblage variability, and focus on the potential role of seasonality in structuring some of this variation. We suggest that there are relationships between a number of lithic variables in the Early Acheulean that are a reflection of consistent activity variants and patterns of landscape use, and that these variables account for discrete clusters of sites according to shared technological bases. While data on seasonality at individual sites in this period are sparse, we hypothesise that there is a likely association between the absence of handaxes and dry season patterns of hominin behaviour, which may reflect a focus on bifaces during the wetter parts of the year. The implications of these findings for the Oldowan-Acheulean transition, seasonal patterns of hominin behaviour, and Early Acheulean landscape use are discussed.					; Linares-Matás, Gonzalo J./AAJ-7870-2020; Linares Matas, Gonzalo Jose/AAJ-7870-2020	Clark, James/0000-0001-7338-7144; Linares Matas, Gonzalo Jose/0000-0002-0429-7636													1866-9557	1866-9565				FEB	2025	17	2							43	10.1007/s12520-024-02133-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12520-024-02133-y													WOS:001403164700001

However, the majority of extant methods for assessing biological integrity concentrate on monitoring at a single trophic level, and there is a paucity of systematic studies that consider multi-trophic level biomes in an integrated manner. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the multi-trophic biotic communities in the downstream section of the Gezhou Dam in the Yangtze River mainstem, which formerly constituted Chinese sturgeon spawning grounds, utilizing eDNA metabarcoding technology. Furthermore, the objective was to establish a multi-trophic Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) assessment system. In this study, we sampled 18 sampling sites in three time periods, and reference sites were selected based on a number of factors, including the distance between the sampling site and the outfall, the extent of vegetation cover, and the degree of anthropogenic disturbance. The biological integrity of the sampling sites was then compared over different time periods (before, during, and after spawning season). The eDNA analysis enabled the construction of comprehensive biological integrity indicators, which considered fish, benthic invertebrates, zooplankton, phytoplankton, fungi, and microbial communities (It should be noted that due to the overlap of information and the weak indication of integrity of the indicators, the final indicator system will not include all taxa, but only some of them). The results demonstrated that the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) scores of the reference and disturbance sites exhibited notable differences in both individual and whole time periods (p < 0.05), with an observed tendency for increased integrity with distance from the dam. Positive linear correlation was observed between IBI scores and sturgeon eDNA concentrations at all sampling sites. The assessment outcomes exhibited satisfactory indicative capacity and spatial and temporal consistency, providing a reliable foundation for an ecosystem health assessment. Furthermore, the successful application of this assessment method offers novel insights and tools for future ecosystem monitoring and assessment.

Occurrence of Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria in Urban Surface Water Sources in Bangladesh	CURRENT MICROBIOLOGY												Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) result in an estimated 1.27 million human deaths annually worldwide. Surface waters are impacted by anthropogenic factors, which contribute to the emergence and spread of ARB in the aquatic environment. While research on antibiotic resistance in surface waters has increased recently in developing nations, including Bangladesh, especially in aquaculture, such studies are still limited in Bangladesh compared to developed nations. In this study, bacteria strains isolated from three rivers and two lakes in Khulna city, Bangladesh were characterized for their antibiotic resistance using disk diffusion method. Of the 106 bacterial isolates from 180 surface water samples, the majority exhibited resistance to Ciprofloxacin (75.0-87.5%) and Ceftriaxone (65.6-78.1%), while resistance to Ampicillin was comparatively lower (9.4-18.8%). Notably, the prevalence of ARB was observed to be higher during the wet seasons compared to the dry seasons. The 16S rRNA gene analysis showed that Shigella flexneri was the most dominant (17.9%) bacterium among the ARB cultured from surface waters, followed by Escherichia fergusonii (12.5%), Proteus mirabilis (10.7%), and Enterobacter quasiroggenkampii (8.9%). At the genus level, Enterobacter (23.5%), Shigella (20.6%), and Escherichia spp. (14.7%) were the most abundant among the ARB in both river and lake samples. The findings of this study highlight the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in surface water sources and suggest the need for enhanced monitoring and improved disposal practices to mitigate potential public health risks.

Learned olfactory cues play a critical role in natal homing of Pacific salmon and other fishes, but the underlying chemical signature of streams remains poorly understood after decades of study. The molecules that convey a stream-specific odour must differ among sites but remain constant over time. Among leading odorant candidates are amino acids; however, little research has assessed the spatial and temporal variability of amino acid profiles in streams. We report a comprehensive chemical study of dissolved amino acids as potential olfactory cues for homing by migratory fish. Specifically, we profiled amino acids in water from 23 streams in the upper Laurentian Great Lakes basin over 2 years. We investigated variation in amino acid profiles (1) among regions and rivers within a year, (2) between years and (3) among sites and across the seasons of migration and early life history within a stream. Liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry revealed nanomolar concentrations for most of the 20 L-amino acids measured, above the levels detectable by studied migratory fishes. Moreover, amino acid profiles were temporally stable between 2 years and across an annual season from adult spawning migration through offspring early-life development within a stream. However, spatial differences in amino acid profiles were evident primarily over large geographic distances (among regions) but not among tributaries within regions or among sites within a stream. Collectively, our results indicate dissolved amino acids may be consistent components of rivers' odorant profiles but suggest additional molecules are likely important for natal homing of migratory fishes to specific spawning sites. We suggest that future studies consider the combined importance of amino acids and molecules from other chemical classes. Understanding the chemical basis of olfactory-guided natal homing is especially important as human activities could alter the odorant profiles of streams and thereby disrupt fish migrations and negatively impact population recruitment.					; li/F-2833-2014	Larson, Douglas/0000-0002-5264-9499; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				FEB	2025	70	2							e14382	10.1111/fwb.14382	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.14382													WOS:001417843000001

Moreover, investigations into the pollution load index and geo-accumulation index revealed that the distribution of heavy metals during the monsoon flood had moderate to higher effects. However, it can be observed from the average values of PER (720) and PLI (> 1) that the sediments of the Cauvery River possess a considerably high level of toxicity. Based on the results, the sediment samples from the Cauvery River basin exhibited significant levels of Cd and Hg, whereas other metals were comparatively less severe.

Rainfall variability was evaluated using the coefficient of variation (CV) while trends were analyzed using the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope (SS) estimator. Meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural droughts were analyzed through the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI), and Standardized Soil Moisture Index (SSMI), respectively. The results revealed a prevalence of high temporal variability in monthly rainfall, except for March and April, which exhibited moderate variability. Moreover, the wet seasons: March-April-May (MAM) and October-November-December (OND), predominantly showed low variability. On the other hand, the trend analysis of monthly rainfall revealed mixed spatial and temporal patterns. However, January, February, March, April, May, and August through December exhibited a prominent upward trend ranging from 3.2 mm/decade to 10.6 mm/decade, while June and July generally showed a negative trend ranging from - 0.2 mm/decade to -1.1 mm/decade. Additionally, the seasonal and annual rainfall exhibited a predominantly upward trend between 0.8 mm/decade and 6.7 mm/decade. The drought analysis revealed several instances of severe and extreme drought, with prolonged drought events becoming more apparent over 6-month and 12-month timescales. The SSI and SSMI showed limited correlation with SPI at shorter time scales (1-month and 3-month) but demonstrated a notably stronger relationship at longer time scales (6-month and 12-month). Decision-makers should consider these findings to inform policies and strategies for water management, agriculture, and climate adaptation in the sub-basin.					; Mulungu, Deogratias/ABC-8552-2020	, Fides/0000-0001-8706-037X; Mulungu, Deogratias/0000-0003-2283-9918; Tibangayuka, Nickson/0000-0002-3207-4632													1865-0473	1865-0481				FEB	2025	18	2							184	10.1007/s12145-025-01699-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12145-025-01699-y													WOS:001398292300001

Unfortunately, the interaction between these two land surface processes as well as their joint effect remain unclear. In this study, based on a homogenized Landsat-Sentinel archive, TLD was detected in the Lena Basin during 2000-2022 thawing seasons using the modified LandTrendr algorithm. Only 9.7% of thermokarst lakes (TLs) experienced remarkable drainage, TLs larger than 30 hm2 were more prone to undergone drainage processes. The drainage proportion among TLs with different extents all exceeded 10% during 2013-2015, suggesting the gradual drainage which lasted for three years or longer was likely to be the dominating type. The subsidence rates (-1.64 +/- 0.89 to -1.94 +/- 1.41 mm per year) surrounding drained TLs were higher than regional average (-1.40 +/- 1.19 to -1.60 +/- 1.26 mm per year). As the distance to drained TLs decreased, the proportion of subsidence measurements, rates, and seasonal subsidence magnitude exhibited consistent increasing trends. The subsidence rate was higher in the direction of more intense drainage than that in other directions. The ground subsidence trigger TLD by providing meltwater and reducing structural support, while TLD in turn contributes to ground subsidence by forming drainage channels. More importantly, our findings proved that their interaction further accelerates permafrost degradation, which is critical for more accurately modeling the complex permafrost degradation processes under the warmer and wetter Arctic climate.

The community structure of the phytoplankton was analysed. The results showed that phytoplankton densities increased significantly in months with higher temperatures, with data from July revealing that Cyanophyta and Chlorophyta predominated in Huating Lake, while Cyanophyta dominated in Shengjin Lake. By August, at 69.27 %, Bacillariophyta had become the dominant taxon in Shengjin Lake. In contrast, Bacillariophyta in Huating Lake increased, while the distribution of the three main dominant taxa, Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta and Cyanophyta, became more balanced, with each accounting for approximately 30 %. Redundancy analysis further confirmed that the water temperature (WT) was the most critical factor affecting phytoplankton abundance. In addition, the Mantel analysis revealed differences in the factors affecting the abundance of dominant taxa in the two lakes: phytoplankton in Shengjin Lake was mainly correlated with the WT, while Huating Lake's phytoplankton community corresponded more significantly with dissolved oxygen (DO) and Secchi depth (SD). This study not only offers a new perspective for understanding the impact of extreme high temperatures on the phytoplankton community structure in different water bodies but also provides fundamental data support for future water resource management and conservation efforts.																				2950-5097				FEB	2025	45	1					117	126		10.1016/j.ecofro.2024.09.009	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecofro.2024.09.009													WOS:001398566100001

However, the response of the soil microorganisms of frozen soils along altitude gradients remains unclear. In this study, we employed 16S rRNA sequencing and LC-MS metabolomics to investigate the response of soil microbial communities and soil metabolites to vertical stratification in the permafrost soils of the Qinghai Lake region. The results indicated that Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria were key soil bacterial phyla in the permafrost soils of Qinghai Lake during the freezing period, with Proteobacteria and Firmicutes showing significant sensitivity to vertical stratification (p < 0.05). The majority of the physicochemical factors exhibited a trend of initially increasing and then decreasing with increasing altitude, whereas pH showed the opposite trend. pH and moisture content were identified as the most important environmental factors influencing soil bacterial community structure. Deterministic processes dominated the assembly of bacterial communities of frozen soils in the Qinghai Lake basin. Co-occurrence network analysis showed that increasing altitude gradients led to a higher average degree of the bacterial network, while reducing network complexity and inter-species connectivity. Soil metabolomics analysis revealed that vertical stratification altered the metabolic profiles of 27 metabolites, with the significantly changed metabolites primarily associated with carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. In conclusion, the characteristics of the Qinghai Lake permafrost were regulated by regional vertical stratification, which further influenced microbial community structure and soil metabolic characteristics, thereby altering carbon and nitrogen stocks. Specifically, higher altitudes were more favorable for the retention of the carbon and nitrogen stocks of frozen soils in the Qinghai Lake basin.																				2076-2607				FEB	2025	13	2							459	10.3390/microorganisms13020459	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms13020459								40005823					WOS:001430938200001
J	Hemmler, KS; Camara, B; Buerkert, A				Hemmler, Katharina Salomea; Camara, Bouraima; Buerkert, Andreas			Social ecology of artisanal sand mining in the Niger River around Bamako, Mali	PLOS ONE												Sand, shaping both natural waterways and urban infrastructure, has recently seen a major surge in extraction, particularly in rapidly urbanizing regions like West Africa. To assess the organization, quantification, and socio-ecological implications of sand mining around Mali's capital Bamako, we employed a mixed methods approach including structured and unstructured interviews, truck counts, turbidity analyses, and river depth measurements. Our study identified five artisanal systems for mining sand and gravel from the Niger River, using tied-up pirogues, single pirogues, carts, tractors, and trucks. Recent increases in extracted quantities, workforce size, and sand prices were observed, resulting in an estimated annual extraction of 4.86 million m3 in 2022, mainly sourced from upstream of Bamako. With extraction rates surpassing natural replenishment, the riverbed in the study communities of Gouni and Usine Toch has reportedly lowered by 1.4 m and 1.8 m during the last 50 years. Mining activities are highly informal, characterized by self-organization, low and irregular salaries, and unsafe working conditions, particularly for women. Economically, sand mining activities have created symbiotic relationships rather than conflicts with local farming, fishing and other livelihoods. Sand mining operations did not significantly affect the Niger River's water turbidity, which varied primarily with seasonal rainfall fluctuations. Recent developments suggest that mining activities are accelerating, with mechanized practices likely to replace current artisanal methods and underlying social structures.					; Salomea, Katharina/LFU-0925-2024	Buerkert, Dr. Andreas/0000-0003-1329-1559; 													1932-6203					JAN 30	2025	20	1							e0318029	10.1371/journal.pone.0318029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318029								39883607					WOS:001447005000072

In the epilimnion, 0+ perch prey upon daphnids during daytime. Gradually, the number of adult Daphnia in the epilimnion decrease until the epilimnion is nearly devoid of daphnids. The population as a whole may decrease, as in 1991, or may increase as in 1992. Genotype composition, as determined by allozyme analysis, changed substantially within a fortnight in 1992, and one genotype became dominant. Our data are in agreement with the hypothesis that predation on different genotypes (clones) occurs during the beginning of a seasonal period of diel vertical migration, though our data do not allow to exclude alternative explanations.																			0018-8158					DEC 24	1997	360						177	185		10.1023/A:1003121520393	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003121520393													WOS:000073482200021

This is the first report of this species infecting dreissenids anywhere in the world. Most worms inhabited the mantle cavity, where they caused erosion of the mantle and gill epithelia as determined by histopathological examination. Others penetrated various tissues; one had invaded the ovary and was feeding on oocytes and ovarian tissues. Of 606 mussels examined, 166 (27.4%) harbored at least 1 C. limnaei. The prevalence varied between 1% and 80%, depending on the collection site and date. The worms were slightly but significantly more prevalent in D. bugensis than in D. polymorpha. The intensity ranged from 1 to 18 worms per infected host. Variations in prevalence and intensity were not related to the size or sex of the host, but the data did suggest some seasonality.

The target variables to model and predict are Cs concentrations in lake water and in predatory fish. These results emanate from IAEA's VAMP project, initiated after the Chernobyl accident in 1986. The sites included in this work cover a wide range of lake and catchment characteristics. This new VAMP model has nine specific components (see below), which are meant to increase the predictive accuracy of the model and make it easy to apply for lakes in general. (1) A seasonal variability moderator for water discharge. (2) A dimensionless moderator for the water retention rate. (3) A seasonal variability moderator for epilimnetic and hypolimnetic temperatures, which influence lake stratification and redox-induced internal loading of radiocesium from sediments. (4) A transfer coefficient to calculate relationships between biomasses. (5) An outflow rate function for the transport of cesium from the catchment to the lake. (6) A dimensionless moderator for planktonic uptake of radiocesium, i.e. for the transfer of cesium in dissolved phase in the lake water to phytoplankton. (7) An algorithm for the lake partition coefficient (Kd). (8) A sub-model to express biological half-lives. (9) An approach to quantify internal loading. Empirical validations, and critical sensitivity tests, have shown that the VAMP model in many lakes yields just as good predictions as parallel sets of empirical data, and this is as goon as any model can yield. rt should be possible to improve the VAMP model further if and when more field data become available, for both the VAMP lakes and other sites.

High-resolution modeling of groundwater storage is often challenging due to the limitations of observation techniques and mathematical methods. In this study, two machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely random forest (RF) and artificial neural networks (ANNs), were employed to estimate groundwater level anomaly (GWLA) and groundwater storage anomaly (GWSA) with a 0.25 degrees resolution using multi-source datasets, including in-situ wells, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), land surface models and hydrogeological parameters. The results indicated the ANN algorithm outperformed the RF algorithm in predicting the spatiotemporal variations of the shallow and deep GWLA in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River Basin (MLYRB). Hence, the ANN algorithm was used to construct a model for predicting the GWSA over the 2005-2017 period. The GWSA exhibited an increasing linear rate of about 0.77 +/- 0.30 mm/yr in almost the entire area, except in the Han River Basin (HRB), where GWSA decreased by-1.18 +/- 0.38 mm/yr due to decreased precipitation amounts. The occurrence of seasonal variations in the deep GWSA showed lead time effects compared with those in the shallow GWSA, ranging from 0 to 1 month and 1 to 2 months in the humid and relatively dry areas, respectively. It was found that the ANN-based model results showed pronounced responses of the GWSA to the drought events. The standard groundwater drought index (SGDI) was further calculated to assess the spatiotemporal characteristics of the groundwater drought events. The results revealed the occurrence of a severe drought event in 2011, as well as pronounced impacts of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events on the GWSA. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of in-situ groundwater measurements in enhancing the reliability of ML-based GWSA prediction. Furthermore, the constructed high-resolution groundwater variation features in this study can provide water resource managers with enhanced information and valuable insights into climate-induced groundwater changes.																			0301-4797	1095-8630				FEB	2025	375								124322	10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.124322	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.124322		JAN 2025						39879920					WOS:001414992600001

Trapping surveys have been conducted annually since to assist growers in timely applications of preventative control measures. In 2021, a similar-looking introduced species, Anisandrus maiche (Kurentsov), was identified in traps in west central New York. Anisandrus maiche was first recorded in 2005 in Pennsylvania but its history in New York was unclear due to potential misidentification. We collected and identified ambrosia beetles using ethanol-baited bottle traps in 2022 and 2023 in New York at 2 commercial apple orchards near Lake Ontario and 2 cider apple orchards in the lower Finger Lakes district. Traps were placed in a forest interior, the forest edge, and the orchard edge at each site. Xylosandrus germanus was trapped from mid-April into early October; it was abundant in the Lake Ontario region but less so in the Finger Lakes. In contrast, counts of A. maiche were very high in the Finger Lakes but extremely low near Lake Ontario. It was trapped from late-May to mid-September. Most other bark and ambrosia beetle species were uncommon. Captures of X. germanus and A. maiche were generally highest in the forest interior and declined toward the orchard edge, but each species was usually present in traps across habitats at the same time. Thus, the practice of trapping at forest edges should continue. Both species can potentially infest stressed trees, including in orchards, throughout the growing season.																			0046-225X	1938-2936				APR	2025	54	2					386	393		10.1093/ee/nvaf010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/nvaf010		JAN 2025						39874245					WOS:001407177300001

Environmental DNA (eDNA) has been increasingly employed in this field due to its efficiency and accuracy. However, its potential applications in freshwater ecosystems require further validation. In this study, we evaluated the performance of 18S rRNA and COI primers for freshwater zooplankton diversity monitoring and systematically compared the selected primers with the microscopy method in Qiandao Lake, China. Our results indicated that the COI primer marker (mlCOIintF/jgHCO2198) was more suitable for freshwater zooplankton diversity monitoring than 18S rRNA. The eDNA method identified a total of 102 species, whereas the microscopy method detected 111 species. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis and nonparametric multivariate statistical tests revealed that both abundance and biomass species compositions determined by microscopy differed significantly from those based on eDNA reads. Both methods detected significant seasonal changes in zooplankton community species composition, while eDNA provided a comprehensive view of the complex interactions within the community. Both methods indicate that rotifers are the primary group driving seasonal changes in the zooplankton community. The eDNA identified more environmental factors associated with seasonal changes in zooplankton communities than microscopy, including dissolved oxygen (DO), nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), and total phosphorus (TP). The eDNA reads of rotifer and crustacean plankton increased linearly with their morphological abundance but not with biomass. Furthermore, combining morphological abundance and biomass as predictor variables for eDNA reads moderately enhanced the explanatory power compared to using them individually. Although eDNA cannot yet replace morphological methods, its efficiency and sensitivity make it a valuable complementary tool for zooplankton monitoring, with considerable potential for future applications.					he, xi/JXN-3817-2024															2296-7745				JAN 27	2025	12								1509743	10.3389/fmars.2025.1509743	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2025.1509743													WOS:001415973700001

Remote sensing provides a rapid and convenient means of observation, but water quality inversion models are often limited by the complex optical properties of inland waters and the availability of limited in-situ samples. The Forel-Ule color index (FUI), combined with satellite data, is effective for large-scale, comprehensive water quality assessments. However, the long-term water color dynamics of YR and its response to environmental changes have not been systematically studied. This study developed an improved hue angle (alpha, FUI conversion parameter) inversion model using Landsat data and assessed YR's water color dynamics from 1985 to 2023. The results showed that YR's FUI was generally high (mean FUI: 16.84 +/- 1.85), with notable seasonal variation and spatial distribution patterns significantly influenced by dam construction and environmental features. Over the past 38 years, 86.47 % of river sections exhibited a declining alpha trend, particularly in the Loess Plateau. Reduced sediment load and increased vegetation, driven by engineering measures and the "Grain for Green" policy, were the primary factors behind long-term water color changes. Overall, the shift of YR water color towards greener hues was a positive signal, indicating improvements in water quality and ecosystem recovery. This study is significant for a deeper understanding of YR's water quality changes and for informing watershed ecological restoration and management strategies.																			1569-8432	1872-826X				FEB	2025	136								104369	10.1016/j.jag.2025.104369	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2025.104369		JAN 2025											WOS:001412170600001

J	TITUS, JE; HOOVER, DT				TITUS, JE; HOOVER, DT			TOWARD PREDICTING REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN SUBMERSED FRESH-WATER ANGIOSPERMS	AQUATIC BOTANY												Reproduction is central to changes in distribution and abundance patterns of submersed freshwater macrophytes. In this paper we seek to identify potential 'bottlenecks' limiting sexual or vegetative reproduction or its predictability for these plants. To this end we consider the regulation of seed production, seed fate, vegetative propagule production, and vegetative propagule fate in turn, both in general terms and for the perennial Vallisneria americana Michx. in particular. Plant biomass appears to be an important determinant of the incidence of flowering for greenhouse-grown Vallisneria americana: 88% of 425 plants either failed to flower if below a threshold dry weight of 0.75 g, or flowered if above it. The number of flowers (in females) or inflorescences (in males), however, was only moderately well correlated with Vallisneria biomass, and the flowering 'threshold rule' weakened considerably in the field. Closer examination of the dependence of seed output on plant biomass and pollination intensity, and of the importance of seed or fruit abortion is needed for submersed species. Our ignorance of seed fate is exemplified by the paucity of quantitative studies on dispersal distances and seed deposition patterns, on seed banks, and on features of seed microenvironments pertinent to germination, although the sensitivity of seed dormancy and germination to a variety of environmental conditions has been tested in the laboratory for many species. Further, losses of seeds and seedlings as a result of unfavorable environments, sediment disturbance, flotation, pathogens, and herbivores are generally not well characterized. Overall, the principal limiting step for sexual reproduction may in some cases be lack of floral induction, and in others, ineffective pollination, but dispersal away from the local population, failure of seeds to germinate, and the challenges of seedling establishment cannot be ruled out. Plant size is well correlated with vegetative propagule production for both greenhouse and field Vallisneria populations. As with seed germination, the germination of vegetative propagules has been relatively well studied in the laboratory, but important regulators of germination and establishment in the field warrant further study. We suggest that more investigations at two interfaces of physiological ecology and demography may be particularly fruitful. Regarding propagule production, experimental focus on allocation patterns which 'translate' accumulated resources into seeds or vegetative propagules should prove rewarding. Regarding propagule fate, post-dispersal mortality of seeds and vegetative propagules may be rooted in physiological tolerance limits, but could also be attributable to pathogen or herbivore attack.																			0304-3770	1879-1522				AUG	1991	41	1-3					111	136		10.1016/0304-3770(91)90041-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(91)90041-3													WOS:A1991GD57300006

The scientific literature describes this effect as occurring gradually, with higher intensity in the sites near the shoreline and decreasing intensity with distance from the reservoir. Experiments with two soybean cultivars were conducted during four crop seasons to evaluate soybean yield in relation to distance from the Itaipu reservoir and determine the effect of air temperature and water availability on soybean crop yield. Fifteen experimental sites were distributed in three transects perpendicular to the Itaipu reservoir, covering an area at approximately 10 km from the shoreline. The yield gradient between the site closest to the reservoir and the sites farther away in each transect did not show a consistent trend, but varied as a function of distance, crop season, and cultivar. This finding indicates that the Itaipu reservoir does not affect the yield of soybean plants grown within approximately 10 km from the shoreline. In addition, the variation in yield among the experimental sites was not attributed to thermal conditions because the temperature was similar within transects. However, the crop water availability was responsible for higher differences in yield among the neighboring experimental sites related to water stress caused by spatial variability in rainfall, especially during the soybean reproductive period in January and February.

Over a 2-year period in Lake Saint-Jean, Quebec, Canada, we show that during the growing season, Diacyclops bicuspidatus thomasi (May-June) had its highest daily mortality rate during metamorphosis (N6-C1), while Leptodiaptomus ashlandi (June-August) had its highest daily mortality rates during the naupliar stages. Patterns in daily recruitment rates differed between the species with the early stages of L. ashlandi experiencing a greater population loss during the growing season. Recruitment of D. bicuspidatus thomasi was controlled by reproduction, while recruitment of L. ashlandi was governed by reproduction and mortality/ survival although also influenced by seasonal patterns of phytoplankton biomass. A multiple regression model suggested that cannibalism influenced the mortality of the early stages of D. bicuspidatus thomasi during their growing season. Temperature, competition and cannibalism influenced the mortality of the early stages of L. ashlandi. However, there are interannual differences likely due to interannual difference in seasonal patterns of phytoplankton biomass. Our study emphasizes the importance of interactions between bottom-up and top-down controls governing copepod population dynamics.

L(-1). Chlorophyll a concentrations in the river were not simply a reflection of the concentrations in the headwaters. On movement from the lentic headwaters into the lotic river waters there was usually a significant decrease in chi-a concentration. Downstream there were reaches of net increase in chi-a (sources), reaches of no change in concentration, and reaches of net decrease (sinks). Increases in concentration only occurred over reaches with retention times of 72 h or longer. No increases in chi-a concentration occurred over a reach with a retention time less than 50 h. Chlorophyll a concentration was not significantly correlated with discharge. Chlorophyll a concentration was positively related to total phosphorus concentration (R(2) = 0.15, p = 0.016). About 50% of the variation in chl-a concentration could be accounted for by a combination of total phosphorus, nitrate, and soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations.

Despite past conservation efforts, pollution persists, particularly in the Bizerte Lagoon. This study investigated the impact of water dynamics and climatic conditions on heavy metal contamination in the IBLC's sediments. During the dry hydrological year of 2019/2020, 80 surface sediment samples were collected and analyzed for heavy metal concentrations using inductively coupled plasma. Sediment quality was first evaluated by comparing heavy metal concentrations against sediment quality guidelines established by NOAA. Additionally, contamination indices, including the contamination factor (CF), pollution load index (PLI), and geo-accumulation index (Igeo), were utilized to provide a more detailed assessment. Spatial and temporal variations in contamination were assessed, with seasonal variations mapped using the inverse distance weighting method. The findings revealed that El-Fouledh, the Menzel Jamil industrial area, and the Menzel Abderrahmane port are the primary pollution sources. The spatial distribution of pollution shows a decreasing gradient from the east (Bizerte Lagoon) to the west (Lake Ichkeul), with high levels of cadmium, lead, and zinc exceeding sediment quality guidelines and posing significant threats to this Ramsar-listed ecosystem. Spearman<acute accent>s correlation coefficient highlighted the persistence of pollution across seasons, emphasizing the urgent need for comprehensive management strategies to mitigate pollution and preserve the IBLC's ecological integrity.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				JAN 21	2025	197	2							179	10.1007/s10661-024-13606-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-024-13606-x								39836223					WOS:001401220100001

However, the specific patterns of drought, particularly seasonal variations, remain poorly understood, making it crucial to investigate these dynamics for effective water management and resilience planning. We employed calibrated SWAT model to simulate monthly soil moisture in five sub-basins to analyze drought characteristics across the PLB over the past six decades. A Multivariate Standardized Drought Index (MSDI) was then developed with simulated Standardized Soil Moisture Index (SSI) and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) based on copula functions. We found that (1) The SWAT can simulate monthly streamflow well with NS being 0.76-0.92 for validation data over the sub-basins in the PLB. (2) The MSDI index indicated that there were more drought events during 1960-1979 and 2000-2019, highlighting a cyclical pattern of drought events in the PLB. (3) The Xiushui River Basin encountered the most extreme drought conditions since 2000, indicating the basin faced a high risk of dry conditions. Additionally, our wavelet period analysis showed an increase in drought frequency after the year 2000, with less distinct periodicity. These findings contribute to our understanding of drought dynamics in the Poyang Lake Basin and offer valuable insights for developing sustainable water resource management and climate adaptation strategies in the region.

This study employed environmental DNA (eDNA) to examine the seasonal dynamics of multitrophic communities in the typical shallow eutrophic lakes of Dianchi (plateau) and Taihu (plain), exploring how eutrophication stress influences community composition, organismal networks, and stability. We found that plateau and plain lakes had their respective dominant taxa and diversity changes across seasons. The structure of organismal networks composed of dominant taxa varied significantly across lakes and seasons, among which Taihu Lake exhibited 17.9% higher connectivity and 8.2% greater robustness compared to Dianchi Lake. Dominant taxa and their organismal networks played a critical role in determining the stability changes in plateau and plain lakes through different pathways; 30% of the stability variation in Dianchi Lake was attributed to bottom-up effects, with algae as the core pathway, while 40% of the variation in Taihu Lake was mainly explained by top-down effects, with fish as the core pathway. These findings underscore the lake-specific mechanisms of community stability changes, providing insights into tailored management strategies for eutrophic lakes based on their unique ecological processes.

Kunming city on the edge of the lake is surrounded by industrial establishments. Farm land surrounds the remaining areas of the lake. The lake water is polluted by the Kunming city municipal sewage from 3 million inhabitants, the industrial effluent and farm runoff. Water samples were collected from 12 sites along the shore of the lake during the dry (May) and rainy (August) seasons for genotoxicity testing with the Vicia micronucleus assay during the year 1995. Genotoxicity in terms of micronuclei (MCN) frequencies in the root tip cells of Vicia showed a consistent elevated frequency of MCN over the control sample at the 0.05-0.01 levels of significance in both seasons. The MCN frequencies of sites A (Daguanhe), B (Gaoqiao) and C (Xiyuan) were 3.5-4 times as high as the control values (5.25/1000 cells) in the dry season. In the rainy season, the MCN frequencies of water samples from most of the 12 sites were relatively lower than those of the dry season except sites J (Haikou), and K (Kunyang). The average MCN frequency of the dry season samples was 14.97 per 1000 cells and that of the rainy season samples was 12.24 per 1000 cells while the average control value was around 5.00/1000 cells.

J	ISARD, SA; SCHAETZL, RJ				ISARD, SA; SCHAETZL, RJ			ESTIMATING SOIL TEMPERATURES AND FROST IN THE LAKE EFFECT SNOWBELT REGION, MICHIGAN, USA	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												A physically-based computer model is developed for estimating soil temperatures at 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 m in sandy, forested soils, using only daily precipitation and minimum and maximum air temperatures as input data. The algorithm is evaluated by comparing its output to 490 soil temperature observations for 199-93 at 10 sites in Michigan, USA. The mean bias of the errors of the soil temperature estimates ranges from + 0.6 degrees to - 1.6 degrees C, depending upon depth and season, thus comparing favorably to models requiring more detailed input. The model is applied to 14 stations across lower Michigan, using 1951-91 US National Weather Service data, in order to examine regional trends in soil temperature and freezing and to compare these trends to patterns of snow thickness and air temperature. Simulations reveal that soils seldom freeze within the deep lake-effect snow belt of southern Michigan and along the coast of Lake Michigan. Soil freezing is more common at non-snowbelt, interior locations. Based on simulation data, new ''potential freeze day'' indices are presented that correlate better with annual minimum soil temperatures and ''number of days frozen'' than do other, more commonly used indices of freezing not specifically formulated for soils.																			0165-232X					AUG	1995	23	4					317	332		10.1016/0165-232X(94)00020-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0165-232X(94)00020-X													WOS:A1995TA10800003
J	Arora, VK; Lima, A; Shrestha, R				Arora, Vivek K.; Lima, Aranildo; Shrestha, Rajesh			The effect of climate change on the simulated streamflow of six Canadian rivers based on the CanRCM4 regional climate model	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The effect of climate change on the hydro-climatology, particularly the streamflow, of six major Canadian rivers (Mackenzie, Yukon, Columbia, Fraser, Nelson, and St. Lawrence) is investigated by analyzing results from the historical and future simulations (RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios) performed with the Canadian regional climate model (CanRCM4). Streamflow is obtained by routing runoff using river networks at 0.5 degrees resolution. Of these six rivers, the Nelson and St. Lawrence are the most regulated. As a result, the streamflow at the mouth of these rivers shows very little seasonality. Additionally, the Great Lakes significantly dampen the seasonality of streamflow for the St. Lawrence River. Mean annual precipitation (P), evaporation (E), runoff (R), and temperature increase for all six river basins in both future scenarios considered here, and the increases are higher for the more fossil-fuel-intensive RCP 8.5 scenario. The only exception is the Nelson River basin, for which the simulated runoff increases are extremely small. The hydrological response of these rivers to climate warming is characterized by their existing climate states. The northerly Mackenzie and Yukon River basins show a decrease in the evaporation ratio (E/P) and an increase in the runoff ratio (R/P) since the increase in precipitation is more than enough to offset the increase in evaporation associated with increasing temperature. For the southerly Fraser and Columbia River basins, the E/P ratio increases despite an increase in precipitation, and the R/P ratio decreases due to an already milder climate in the northwestern Pacific region. The seasonality of simulated monthly streamflow is also more affected for the southerly Fraser and Columbia rivers than for the northerly Mackenzie and Yukon rivers as snow amounts decrease and snowmelt occurs earlier. The streamflow seasonality for the Mackenzie and Yukon rivers is still dominated by snowmelt at the end of the century, even in the RCP 8.5 scenario. The simulated streamflow regime for the Fraser and Columbia rivers shifts from a snow-dominated to a hybrid or rainfall-dominated regime towards the end of this century in the RCP 8.5 scenario. While we expect the climate change signal from CanRCM4 to be higher than that from other climate models, owing to the higher-than-average climate sensitivity of its parent global climate model, the results presented here provide a consistent overview of hydrological changes across six major Canadian river basins in response to a warmer climate.

Microorganisms play a pivotal role in the reservoir's resource and energy cycle. However, ecological protection efforts for the Shanmei reservoir have encountered numerous challenges in recent years. This study conducted an extensive visual analysis of microbial communities in sediment from the Shanmei reservoir between 2022 and 2024 using amplicon sequencing technology targeting 16S rRNA gene. The results showed that the microbial diversity of sediment showed an obvious seasonal pattern. At the same time, microbial composition also changes with the long-term evolution of time, which may be closely related to the change in environmental conditions. In addition, we have also carried out long-term multidimensional monitoring of the water quality of the Shanmei reservoir, and the results show that the water quality has reached the national drinking water grade. In conclusion, this study not only unveiled the interseasonal dynamics and long-term evolutionary characteristics of sediment microbial communities but also elucidated the significant influence of environmental factors on their composition, structure and function. These findings offer a fresh perspective for understanding the freshwater ecosystem microbial dynamics and provide a scientific foundation for reservoir management and water quality protection.

In this study, we focused on the improvement and evaluation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) fifth-generation ensemble-based seasonal precipitation prediction product, designated (SEASonal prediction of precipitation (SEAS5)). Three selected linear regression methods, namely ordinary least squares (OLS), flexible least squares (FLS) and the quantile-quantile (Q-Q) methods, were used to develop a correction procedure. The watershed of Lake Urmia was selected as a case study. The application of these augmentation methods has yielded encouraging results, demonstrating an improvement in the statistical metrics of SEAS5 precipitation forecasts for the first and second-coming months. However, all linear projection methods improve the performance of the SEAS5 products. The Q-Q method has shown the highest efficiency among the methods, playing a significant role in improving the accuracy of the hindcast precipitation. A variety of statistics (deterministic, forecast skill and uncertainty scores) were used to evaluate the effectiveness of both the raw and enhanced SEAS5 products. These analyses provide a comprehensive understanding of the performance of the SEAS5 product in its original form and after augmentation. The results highlight the potential of the linear projection method (specifically Q-Q method) to improve the accuracy of hindcast precipitation and provide valuable insights for water resource planning in the study area.

Zooplankton from Mundu reservoir, State of Pernambuco, northeast Brazil was studied concerning temporal (hours and seasonal period) and spatial (pelagic and coastal regions in different depths) variabilities, correlating them to the environmental variables and the phytoplankton. Twenty-three infrageneric and five subgeneric zooplankton taxa were observed. On the whole, Rotifera was the dominant group during this study, especially influenced by the oxygen concentrations. Phytoplankton was dominated by Cyanobacteria. On the dry period, physical variables certainly controlled the zooplankton's development, allowing elevated algal densities.

Montrichardia arborescens ( L.) Schott. dominated wetlands cover most of the north and south arms and the littoral zone of the main body of the lake. The vegetation and seed banks of Montrichardia wetland sites were sampled in the north arm, south arm and main body five times from the end of the dry season in 1991 to beginning of the rainy season in 1992. The composition of the vegetation was similar and changed very little at all three sites during the course of the study. These wetlands had 53 species. Besides M. arborescens, other common species were Hamelia patens Jacq., Mikania cordifolia ( L.) Wild., Sarcostemma clausum ( Jacq.) Roem. & Schult., and Vitis caribaea L. In both the vegetation and seed banks, species richness was highest during the dry season. Altogether, the seed banks contained the seeds of 61 species of which 35 were also found in the vegetation. Seeds of three tree species were found in the seed banks that did not grow anywhere in the lake. In the seed bank, seeds of Cyperus odoratus L., Eleocharis interstincta ( Vahl.) R& S, Ludwigia hyssopifolia ( G. Don.) Excell, L. lithospermifolia (Mich.) Hara, Polygonum acuminatum H. B. K., and Sacciolepis striata ( L.) Nash were the most abundant. Mean total seed density over the entire study was 6,500, 3,800, and 6,000 seeds/m(2) in the north arm, south arm, and main basin, respectively. Seed production and dispersal occur primarily during the dry season, and the highest seed densities at all sites were found in the dry season when there was no or little standing water. The lowest seed densities at all sites were found during the rainy season during which seed densities declined over 80% at the north and south arm sites. In the main body of the lake, however, seed densities during the rainy season, although lower than during the dry season, actually increased significantly from 3,600 seeds/m(2) in August 1991 to 6,000 seeds/m(2) in October 1991. A significant decrease in seed density in either the north or south arms or both and a significant increase in the main body site during the rainy season occurred for 5 of the 8 species whose seeds were the most abundant, for all life-form guilds, except hydrophytes and for the entire seed bank. Secondary dispersal by water currents during the rainy season appears to be transporting seeds from the north and south arms into the seed bank of the main body of the lake.																			1385-0237					SEP	2003	168	2					177	190		10.1023/A:1024421324294	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1024421324294													WOS:000183836200001
J	Park, S; Müller-Navarra, DC; Goldman, CR				Park, S; Müller-Navarra, DC; Goldman, CR			Seston essential fatty acids and carbon to phosphorus ratios as predictors for Daphnia pulex dynamics in a large reservoir, Lake Berryessa	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We examined whether seston food quality was a significant factor to predict zooplankton, specifically Daphnia pulex, biomass dynamics in Lake Berryessa, California, U. S. A. The seston composition changed dramatically during the study period. Total macrozooplankton to seston biomass ratios were high during the springtime, as was D. pulex biomass. In monthly growth experiments using natural seston, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) concentration was best in explaining D. pulex growth, although alpha-linolenic acid ( ALA) also showed considerable relationship with D. pulex growth. We built D. pulex growth models using combinations of EPA concentration, C: P ratio, and water temperature. The model using EPA concentration, C: P ratio and water temperature was best in explaining D. pulex biomass in springtime in Lake Berryessa. However, this model did not work for other seasons, suggesting that resource control via seston food quality was prevalent in springtime, but other factors may also become important in other seasons in this reservoir.

To understand the impacts of climate changes, fire disturbance, and herbivory on forest-grassland coexistence in this region, we integrated new and published paleoecological data from two sedimentary records in southeastern Romania with information on herbivore population dynamics and dietary habits. Our findings indicate that fluctuations in forest-grassland cover closely mirrored changes in regional growing season moisture availability in the Black Sea region. During periods with increased moisture availability (e.g. 6000-3800 cal yr BP), diverse broadleaved forest dominated by Quercus expanded. Conversely, more drought- tolerant herbaceous cover increased during drier intervals (7200-6800 and 3800-2000 cal yr BP). We identified a critical tree cover of 25-40% at Mangalia Herghelie and 25-55% at Lake Oltina where neither forest nor grassland dominated. Stable forest states emerged above 40% tree cover and 55% respectively, while grassland- dominated states had tree cover below 25%. Disturbances by fire and herbivores fluctuated over time, and were further influenced by human activity, which along with deforestation, altered the composition and extent of steppe and forest-steppe vegetation. High fire severity occurred during intermediate moisture conditions and tree cover (6800-5500, 3800-2800 cal yr BP), while low fire severity was observed when herbaceous biomass dominated (7200-7000, 2800-2000 cal yr BP) or under greater tree cover (5500-3800 cal yr BP). Herbivore dynamics shifted from large-bodied grazers in the Neolithic and early Eneolithic (7650-6550 cal yr BP; Prehamangia and Hamangia cultures) to a more diverse array of feeding types involving smaller domestic and wild herbivores along with sedentary agriculture during the flourishing Eneolithic (6550-5850 cal yr BP; Gumelnita culture), before returning to larger domestic grazers as well as omnivores in the Bronze and Iron Ages (3500-2000 cal yr BP). Large-bodied herbivores with selective diets (primarily grazers) had a more substantial effect on grasses compared to mixed feeders with bulk diets, whereas domestic herbivory was associated with increased apophyte abundance and diversity. Our findings underscore the essential factors for sustainable management of forest-grassland mosaics under changing climate conditions with projected accelerating aridification. They also highlight the need for continued research to enhance our understanding of these biodiverse, sensitive open ecosystems to inform effective management strategies.

Saccular potentials of the male round goby, Neogobius melanostomus, a hearing non-specialist	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY												The round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) is a benthic fish species native to Central Eurasia but has colonized much of the waterways in the Laurentian Great Lakes in North America. While they are known to produce acoustic signals that aid in conspecific agonistic and reproductive interactions, the species does not possess a swim bladder and thus does not have any hearing specializations that would allow for sound pressure detection. Here, the auditory evoked potentials from saccular hair cells were characterized to determine the frequency response and auditory sensitivity of the saccule. Saccular potentials were recorded from the medial region of the saccular maculae during playback of single frequency acoustic stimuli (105-605 Hz). Auditory tuning curves based on both sound pressure (dB re: 1 mu Pa.) and particle acceleration (dB re: 1 ms(-2)) suggest that the saccule is most sensitive to 105 and 125 Hz and that the highest thresholds occurred at frequencies >= 205 Hz.																			1095-6433	1531-4332				APR	2025	302								111802	10.1016/j.cbpa.2024.111802	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2024.111802		JAN 2025						39756788					WOS:001398025200001

Compared to other types of gas storage, they have advantages such as large storage capacity, high safety, and suitable geological conditions. This article analyzes the current status of salt cavern gas storage construction in China, the methods of cavern creation, and key cavern construction technologies. It concludes that there is a significant contradiction between the supply and demand of natural gas in China, leading to a strong demand for gas storage construction. To adapt to the complex geological conditions of salt mines in China, it is necessary to steadily advance the engineering practice of new energy storage theories and cavity creation technologies, while simultaneously promoting research on key technologies such as cavity monitoring, cavity simulation, and sediment space utilization. In addition, given that China's salt cavern gas storage sites are developing towards deep salt mines, it is necessary to increase research on the special design and material selection of the upper wellbore structure of ultra deep salt cavern gas storage chambers, in order to provide theoretical and technical support for China's future energy underground reserve construction.

Aeolian sediment in El Paso, Texas: Elevated desert sand deposition rates and dust concentrations, enhanced by drought and urban sources	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Deposition of aeolian (windblown) dust and sand in drylands, such as the El Paso, Texas, USA/Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico metropolitan area within the Chihuahuan Desert, impacts soils, ecosystems, human infrastructure, and air quality. We monitored dry bulk deposition using marble dust collectors (MDCOs), a passive sampler, deployed atop a university building 21m above ground level during synoptic-scale wind events in urban El Paso, for five years (2011-2016). A nearby Texas Commission on Environmental Quality air monitor continuously measured particulate matter concentrations. MDCO sediment deposition rates over five synoptic dust event seasons (October-May) averaged 111 gm(-2)yr(-1) (range 85-164 gm(-2) yr(-1)), higher than almost all other North American sites but generally lower than Global Dust Belt locations. These deposition rate values, representing only synoptic-scale wind events, underestimate total annual aeolian deposition (augmented by convective dust events and inputs during non-windstorm conditions). Deposition rates were similar to 2x those reported for rural El Paso County, suggesting urban fugitive dust enhances total dry deposition. Mean grain size of deposited sediment in all events was >50 mu m (sand), even though collected similar to 20 m above the height of saltation, indicating that events in El Paso can be considered "blowing sand" rather than "blowing dust." PM10 concentrations averaged 28 mu g/m(3) over all collection years but 200 mu g/m(3) during hours dust was observed, were extremely variable, and were significantly higher during years of strong drought. PM2.5/PM10 ratios averaged 0.13-0.14 during collection periods and dust hours. PM2.5 concentrations were less strongly variable, showing the roles of dust and drought in PMcoarse in El Paso. Back trajectories during synoptic events were predominantly from the southwest and west, crossing sandy, erodible desert soils and remote-sensing-identified dust hotspots. MDCO sediments were comprised primarily of predominant Chihuahuan Desert soil minerals (quartz, feldspars, and calcite). Compared to global average aeolian deposition of major and minor elements, El Paso samples were enriched in silicon but depleted in aluminum, titanium, and manganese, as well as iron, an element with important ecological, radiative, and human health impacts. El Paso, Texas appears to be one of the dustiest/sandiest cities in North America.					; Walsh, Elizabeth/AAK-4653-2020	Gill, Thomas E./0000-0001-9011-4105; Walsh, Elizabeth/0000-0002-6719-6883													1352-2310	1873-2844				MAR 1	2025	344								121029	10.1016/j.atmosenv.2025.121029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2025.121029		JAN 2025											WOS:001412522100001

J	SemadeniDavies, A				SemadeniDavies, A			Monthly snowmelt modelling for large-scale climate change studies using the degree day approach	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The degree day or temperature index snowmelt modelling approach has been adapted to provide a simple conceptual, semi-distributed snowmelt-runoff model suitable for large-scale climate impact investigations. The model is forced by pseudo-daily data derived from standard monthly meteorological data. Generic rather than site-specific parameters are used where possible to allow spatial and temporal transferability. Spatial distribution is achieved by elevation and broad vegetation cover. Snow accumulation and melt are determined from air temperature. Catchment runoff is simulated with a one-dimensional water balance sub-model consisting of two soil layers. Available water capacity, percolation and drainage rates are defined by soil texture. The model was tested in three catchments: Valuoja in Estonia and Gimdalsbyn and Kultsjon in Sweden. The catchment areas ranged from approximately 4-2200 km(2), simulation lengths were 10, 21 and 26 years. The snow season timing matched that observed in all three catchments. Comparisons of measured and estimated snow water equivalence in Kultsjon demonstrated that the model can adequately predict snow cover below the tree line. Simulated monthly runoff at Valuoja gave good agreement with observations (r = 0.87) and a paired t-test showed no significant differences. The seasonal discharge pattern at Kultsjon also fitted well (r = 0.85) although the hydrograph generated was too low, probably due to precipitation undercatch. The discharge pattern at Gimdalsbyn was less well modelled (r = 0.55), but the annual runoff totals were similar suggesting a lagged runoff response. Sensitivity analysis showed that the model is insensitive to the generic parameters bur is sensitive to local soil texture. The model is able to capture, from standard meteorological data, patterns of snow accumulation, melt and runoff with a reasonable degree of accuracy without the need to optimise parameters. These features make the model a potentially useful tool for evaluating the impacts of climate change on regional and continental water balances.

J	BRETT, MT				BRETT, MT			RESOURCE QUALITY EFFECTS ON DAPHNIA-LONGISPINA OFFSPRING FITNESS	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The present study addressed the question: is the fitness Daphnia longispina neonates related to the quality (species) of the resource their mothers consumed? A 2 x 2 factorial design with two maternal and neonate resource types was employed, with Rhodomonas and Microcystis used as high- and low-quality resources, respectively. Neonate fitness was assessed using demographic parameters obtained from a life-table study. The resource type neonates consumed always had a stronger effect on the neonates than did the maternal type. Neonate consumption of Rhodomonas, relative to Microcystis, increased fitness. Its estimated by the instantaneous population growth rate, by 25-28%, while maternal consumption of Rhodomonas increased fitness by 6-8%. Neonate Rhodomonas consumption also reduced the age at reaching the primiparous instar; increased brood size at the primiparous instar and body length immediately after the primiparous instar; increases average clutch size, number of clutches produced, total egg production, and mean body length up to and on age 30 days. Regardless of resource type, maternal Rhodomonas consumption resulted in neonates which reached maturity at an earlier age and had a larger individual size immediately after reaching maturity. The mean clutch size, total egg production. and length up to. and at age 30 days were all significantly affected by maternal diet when neonates consumed Microcystis; however, these variables were not influenced by maternal type when neonates consumed Rhodomonas. This is the first study to document maternally mediated effects of resource quality on the fitness of crustacean zooplankton neonates.					; Brett, Michael/A-2066-2010	Brett, Michael/0000-0002-8796-9863; 													0142-7873					APR	1993	15	4					403	412		10.1093/plankt/15.4.403	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/15.4.403													WOS:A1993KZ89800004
J	Tóth, VR				Toth, Viktor R.			Photosynthetic traits of Phragmites australis along an ecological gradient and developmental stages	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Common reed (Phragmites australis) is a cosmopolitan species, though its dieback is a worldwide phenomenon. In order to assess the evolutionary role of phenotypic plasticity in a successful plant, the values and plasticity of photophysiological traits of Phragmites australis were investigated in the Lake Fert & odblac; wetlands at 5 sites with different degrees of reed degradation and along a seasonal sequence. On the one hand, along the established ecological degradation gradient, photophysiological traits of Phragmites changed significantly, affecting plant productivity, although no consistent gradient-type trends were observed. Gradual changes within a season in the values of photosynthetic traits were observed that were recorded in both degraded and stable stands, suggesting a universal response to seasonally changing environmental conditions that could not be overridden by the ecological gradient. On the other hand, reed plants exposed to different levels of degradation showed comparable physiological plasticity; there was no difference in trait variability between stable and degraded stands. This relatively uniform plasticity is likely to contribute to the resilience of reed plants by providing a wider range of adaptive traits under different conditions. In contrast, the 150-200% gradual change in photophysiological trait plasticity with senescence in Phragmites was also demonstrated, reflecting a more dynamic response of the photosynthetic apparatus to seasonal changes. Senescence affected the plasticity of plant traits independently of their degradation status, suggesting a more universal nature of seasonal changes. This research shows that under conditions of conservative resource use determined by stressful habitats, trait values respond to conditions, while trait plasticity shows minimal changes. Furthermore, phenological sequence significantly influenced both the values and the plasticity of the photosynthetic traits studied. Our results underline the impact of ecological degradation on reed physiology and highlight the importance of understanding both trait values and plasticity in plant responses to environmental and seasonal change.

Larval fishes were collected in drift nets that were set in each stream for 72 consecutive hours and emptied at 4.-h intervals. Fantail darter (Ethostoma flabellare and blacknose dace (Rhinichthys atractulus) were the two most abundant native stream fishes and were two of the three species collected in the ichthyoplankton drift. Fantail darter larvae comprised 100%, 98.9%, and 70.2% of the ichthyoplankton in the three streams. Most larval fishes (96%) drifted at night with peak catches occurring at 2400h in Orwell Brook and Trout Brook and 0400h in Little Sandy Creek. Based on stream temperatures, peak spawning and larval drift of blacknose dace probably occurred later in the season.

J	McCullough, GK; Barber, D				McCullough, Greg K.; Barber, David			The effect of suspended solids loading from the linthipe river on light in lake Malawi	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Increasing land use pressure has resulted in increasing suspended solids loading to many African lakes in recent decades, causing concern that littoral habitat may be degraded by sedimentation and light limitation. In a companion paper in this issue, we showed that much runoff into Lake Malawi plunges below the euphotic zone and spreads through the lake via the upper metalimnion, thus mitigating nearshore and upper water column impacts. In this study we use data from multiple surveys through two rainy seasons to describe spatio-temporal distributions of suspended solids concentration (SSC) and transparency caused by the flow of runoff through the Linthipe River delta region of Lake Malawi. SSC in interflow at 30-50 m depth was typically an order of magnitude greater than in surface plumes. Seasonal median transparency near the river mouth was inversely proportional to the suspended load in surface-buoyant inflow, but independent of total loading. This is because storm runoff was more dense (cooler and with higher SSC) than runoff during low-flow periods, so that it was more likely to plunge. The effect was to moderate inter-annual variability in light attenuation near the river mouth because transparency was lower (due to more surface-buoyant inflow of turbid water) in the year when solar irradiance was higher (less cloud cover). The effect was, however, local. Beyond a few kilometers of the river mouth upward mixing of suspended particles carried in interflow reasserted the more intuitive inverse dependence of transparency on total loading.

Diet of Chirostoma lucius (Pisces: Atherinomorpha):: Seasonal trophic spectrum and ontogeny of piscivory	SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST												We determined the diet of Chirostoma lucius from Lake Chapala and Guaracha Reservoir in central Mexico by stomach content analysis. Diet consisted primarily of juveniles of small Chirostoma species, as well as cladocerans and copepods. Seasonal change in prey showed high fish consumption in the rainy period, whereas crustacean consumption increased in the dry period. Diet varied with size, with smaller fish selecting large numbers of small zooplankton prey, whereas the largest size classes fed principally oil fish. The size for the shift to piscivory was smaller in Lake Chapala (10 cm) than Guaracha Reservoir (14 cm), and the value for the pooled data of both populations was 12 cm.

Among these, high Arctic lakes are highly sensitive to rising temperatures due to the influence of ice cover on multiple limnological processes. Here, we studied the sediments of three lakes on northern Ellesmere Island (82.6 degrees N), at the terrestrial limit of the Last Ice Area, to produce records of past environmental change. The colonization of the lakes by diatoms, as well as subsequent diversification and the appearance of planktonic forms, marked important ecological shifts due to warming temperatures and lengthening ice-free periods. A subsequent meta-analysis of 25 circumpolar diatom records revealed compositional shifts that paralleled those of temperature, including a notable acceleration since the turn of the twenty-first century that eclipses shifts previously observed since the mid-nineteenth century.

To contribute to emerging research on alternative protein sources, the biochemistry and seasonal variation in proximate compositions of four sympatric freshwater mussel species were studied for the first time and it was concluded that phenology, notably the gametogenetic cycle, was directly related to the variation among macronutrients. While the highest crude protein and protein to carbohydrate rates were observed in the widespread bradytictic species Anodonta anatina (Linnaeus, 1758), both were comparable in regionally co-distributed tachytictic species Potomida semirugata (Lamarck, 1819), Unio delicatus I. Lea, 1863 and Leguminaia wheatleyi I. Lea, 1862. Although crude protein rates followed an almost identical trend, the seasonal pattern of carbohydrates was species-specific, suggesting its role in the gametogenetic cycle. Mineral contents of the species were comparable to previously studied freshwater mussel taxa in quantity and composition, while L. wheatleyi had the highest content of five out of ten elements analysed. According our results, the biochemical compositions satisfy requirements for supplementary diets and animal feeds, especially in A. anatina.					kebapci, umit/AAU-1537-2021														1323-5818	1448-6067				JAN 2	2025	45	1					39	50		10.1080/13235818.2024.2446878	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13235818.2024.2446878		JAN 2025											WOS:001391858900001

This study was conducted on the Ghodaghodi Lake of Nepal - a Ramsar Site to assess the seasonal variation of water quality and to detect pollution, if any. Water samples were collected in the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon periods from different parts of the lake. Of the various water quality parameters, temperature, pH, EC, TDS, DO levels were measured in-situ, while concentration of Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, Cl-, SO42-, NO3-, HCO3-, NH4+, and PO43- ions was analysed in laboratory. Water of the lake is found to be slightly alkaline with mean pH 7.88 and 8.22, in the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon, respectively. In terms of abundance, the major ions follow the order of Ca2+ > Mg2+ > Na+ > K+ for cations and HCO3- > Cl- > NO3- > SO42 > PO43- for anions. Mean concentrations of Ca2+ are 17.87 and 19.58 mg/L, and of HCO3- are 42.14 and 186.2 mg/L, respectively in the two seasons. Statistical tests such as correlation analysis, cluster analysis, and principal component analysis (PCA) and the Piper, Gibbs, and Mixing plots were used further to understand the nature, origin, and geochemical evolution of the lake water. Carbonate-rock weathering is found to be the chief controller of the lake-water chemistry, while anthropogenic activities emerged as the main reason for organic pollution in the lake as is reflected in the low (< 5.0) dissolved oxygen (DO) level. However, comparison with the WHO guidelines and the Water Quality Index (WQI) values (0-25) certify that water of the lake is absolutely safe for drinking and irrigation.

Few studies have evaluated MP abundance in inland waters, and those that exist often ignore seasonal variations. This study aimed to assess the seasonal variations in microplastic (MP) abundance in the & Idot;skenderun Technical University (& Idot;STE) Pond. MP abundance ranged from 0.5 MPs/L to 10.8 MPs/L, with a mean of 3.7 MPs/L. Fiber-shaped, black-colored, small-sized (< 1000 mu m) MPs were commonly found on the surface water. Statistical analysis confirmed significant variations in MP abundance across seasons. The abundance of MPs in the surface water correlated with the mean annual precipitation. Atmospheric deposition and storm water runoff were major contributors to microplastic pollution in the pond. PP and PET particles were identified. The findings of this study contains preliminary results that can be used in the development of future legislations and regulations.

Influence of lake volume on food web metrics in a freshwater fish assemblage across a small range of ecosystem sizes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Lake size effects on food webs have been most clearly demonstrated for predator fish across large gradients in ecosystem size and species richness. We isolated the influence of lake size to assess food web metrics in six fish species with diverse ecologies across five lakes with similar lake characteristics in Algonquin Provincial Park (Ontario, Canada) using S13C, S15N, and S34S. Lake volume was a significant factor influencing food web metrics across most fish species. However, relationships between lake volume and food web metrics (trophic position, littoral carbon use, S34S, and niche area) were weak. For most species, trophic position decreased with lake volume, opposite from previous studies that included a wider range of lake sizes and biodiversity. Littoral carbon use and S34S showed negative and positive relationships with lake volume, respectively, suggesting a shift to pelagic offshore energy in larger lakes. Albeit weak, our results highlight that multiple co-occurring fish species within a community can have similar responses in littoral carbon use, trophic position, S34S, and niche area across a small range of lake sizes.

However, the existing synthetic aperture radar (SAR) soil moisture retrieval algorithms suffer from insufficient decoupling of surface scattering characteristics and poor RSSM time-series monitoring capabilities. Therefore, this article proposes an integrated time-series relative soil moisture monitoring method based on a SAR backscattering model (SBM). Initially, the SBM is introduced, categorizing land cover into built-up areas, water bodies, vegetation-covered areas, and soil. Addressing the inconsistency in spatiotemporal resolution between optical vegetation indices and SAR data, we establish a unique SAR water cloud model (SWCM) in conjunction with the dual-polarization SAR vegetation index. By employing the SWCM to eliminate vegetation's influence, a high-quality soil backscatter coefficient is obtained. Ultimately, the dry and wet reference values of soil backscatter are calculated to retrieve the relative RSSM time series. Based on Sentinel-1 data, we select three representative experimental areas, namely the Qarhan Salt Lake in dry regions, the Tibetan Plateau Naqu in high-cold regions, and Inner Mongolia Xilinhot in grassland regions, conducting RSSM spatiotemporal monitoring for three years. The experimental results demonstrate that the RSSM exhibits seasonal variations in these three regions. The correlation coefficient between the RSSM monitoring results and the in situ data exceed 0.64, with a maximum of 0.84. Consequently, the proposed method underscores the advantages of simplicity in parameters, high estimation precision, and robust adaptability, thereby augmenting the potential for large-scale global monitoring applications.

Water darkening is an increasingly relevant problem affecting many coastal ecosystems, and it is exacerbated by human activity and climate change. Aims To determine the spectral, isotopic, and quantitative changes in coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) across a salinity gradient from the Glomma River to the outer Oslofjord. Methods. CDOM absorbance was measured on a spectrophotometer and organic carbon in the water column was analysed using stable isotopes. Key results. Spectral slope and CDOM absorption at 443 nm decreases linearly with an increasing salinity. CDOM absorption exhibited significant variations, with low-salinity samples showing higher light absorption per unit of carbon, but little seasonal variations. delta 13C of TOC analysis showed a strong positive correlation with salinity. Conclusion. Dissolved organic matter optical characteristics of coastal waters are tightly linked to CDOM. The distance to the river mouth and to the shore are some of the most important factors affecting water clarity. The delta C-13 of TOC analysis indicated a linear transition from terrestrial to marine carbon sources. Implications. The study has shown how coastal darkening can be an important ecological issue mainly in near-coastal areas and describes valuable diagnostic tools for tracking it.

Modelling the Environmental Determinants of Abundance of Two Sympatric Antelopes (Gerenuk and Grant's Gazelle)	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												A thorough understanding of environmental variables determining the abundance of species is fundamental for effective planning for conservation and management of wildlife and their habitat, especially in managed natural systems. Most protected areas in Africa afforded minimal conservation efforts are poorly assessed and increasingly faced with threats, making effective conservation of wildlife species within challenging. We used road transect surveys to investigate the environmental and anthropogenic variables that determine the abundance of two sympatric antelope (Gerenuk gazelle, [Litocranius walleri] and Grant's gazelle, [Nanger granti]) in Lake Natron partially protected ecosystem in northern Tanzania to improve conservation of these species. Fitting the data with a Quasi-Poisson GLM, we found habitat type, landscape elevation, season and tree cuts were the most important predictors of species abundance for both species. Gerenuk and Grant's gazelle were more abundant in grassland and both tended to avoid degraded patches and areas closer to previous hunting sites, suggesting that habitat loss and hunting is having a top down impacts on the abundance and distribution of these species. Further, both species tended to avoid areas with water points especially during the dry season and foraged more on lowland sites perhaps to avoid being targeted by hunters. Our findings strongly suggest that maintaining habitat quality by minimising human activities such as tree cuts and hunting may improve conservation of antelopes in this fragile ecosystem.					; Rija, Alfan/ACS-3581-2022	Biseko, Beevans Biseko/0009-0003-9390-2926; 													0141-6707	1365-2028				JAN	2025	63	1							e70008	10.1111/aje.70008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aje.70008													WOS:001395409200001
J	Chen, XY; Zhang, XY; Zhuang, CW; Hu, XB				Chen, Xingyu; Zhang, Xiuyu; Zhuang, Changwei; Hu, Xibang			Detecting the Lake Area Seasonal Variations in the Tibetan Plateau from Multi-Sensor Satellite Data Using Deep Learning	WATER												Monitoring lake area changes with a higher spatial and temporal resolution can facilitate a more detailed analysis of climate-related changes in the Tibetan Plateau. In the Landsat era, optical remote sensing observation with water body index-based methods mainly contributed to alpine lake investigation. However, monitoring the seasonal or monthly change of a lake area is challenging since optical data are easily contaminated by the high cloud cover in the Tibetan Plateau. To cope with this, we generated new time series datasets including Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) observations. Meanwhile, we presented an improved deep learning model with spatial and channel attention mechanisms. Based on these datasets, we compared several deep learning models and found that the CloudNet+ had better performance. Taking this architecture as a baseline, we added spatial and channel attention mechanisms to generate our AttCloudNet+ for extracting the lake area. The results revealed that AttCloudNet+ had a better performance compared with the CloudNet+ and other CNNs (e.g., DeepLabv3+, UNet). For the accuracy of the lakeshore prediction, results from AttCloudNet+ demonstrated closer distance to the truth-value than other models. The obtained mean RMSE and MAE were 21.6 and 16.6 m, respectively. In contrast, the mean RMSE and MAE of the DeepLabv3+ were 99.5 and 76.0 m, while the corresponding RMSE and MAE for UNet were 91.1 and 64.9 m. In addition, we found our AttCloudNet+ was more robust than UNet and DeepLabv3+ because AttCloudNet+ is less influenced by the input optical images compared with DeepLabv3+ and UNet. By combining the results from different seasons and satellite sensors, we are capable of generating the complete lake area seasonal dynamics of the 15 largest lakes. The mean correlation coefficient (R2) between our seasonal lake area time series and the water level of LEGOS is 0.81, which is much better than the previous study (0.25). This indicates that our method can be used to monitor lake area seasonal variation, which is important for understanding regional climate change in the Tibetan Plateau and other similar areas.

Discriminating between detrital and authigenic clays is crucial to elucidate paleoenvironmental conditions in lacustrine deposits. This study provides insight into the sedimentary evolution of clay minerals from source, lacustrine Miocene marlstones and mudstones, to sink, represented by three recent hyperalkaline playa-lakes in Central Spain. XRD, TEM, and AEM analyses show concomitant detrital and authigenic palygorskites in the three playa-lakes. The inherited palygorskites exhibit degradation features, larger widths, and common and ideal compositions, in contrast to neoformed particles. The latter are narrower. Depending on the hydrochemical composition of each playa-lake, neoformed palygorskites are enriched in a different octahedral cation (Al2O3, MgO, and Fe2O3). Iron-rich palygorskites are only formed in association with authigenic saponites in one of the playa-lakes. The same effect of magnesium competition between smectite and palygorskite is observed in Miocene mudstones, where palygorskite is relatively enriched in iron. In hyperalkaline, seasonal playa-lakes lying in the vicinity, slight physicochemical differences play a crucial role in the crystallochemical composition of authigenic palygorskites, highlighting the use of this mineral as a geochemical proxy.

Laboratory simulations were conducted using the Box-Behnken design to model the effects of ozone dose and treatment duration on bromate formation, trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs) and specific UV absorption (SUVA). Two ozonation strategies were tested: Strategy 1 aimed to minimize all DBPs, while Strategy 2 focused on controlling bromate levels while keeping THMs, HAAs and SUVA below 80% of maximum contaminant levels. Results showed that Strategy 2 reduced ozone consumption while maintaining water quality within regulatory standards, providing a cost-effective and environmentally sustainable treatment approach. Seasonal and depth-dependent variations in water quality had a significant impact on treatment efficiency and required adjustments to operational settings.

Recent CA-ID-TIMS U/Pb radiometric datings place the Muse section in the lower Asselian (similar to 298.6 Ma), leading to a re-examination of the palynoflora using an alternative palynological method. Twelve productive samples provide a detailed taxonomic and quantitative evaluation of the palynoflora. The new data revealed now two distinct palynological assemblages, Muse-A in the lower part and Muse-B in the middle-upper part of the Muse section, assigned to a peat swamp forest environment dominated by cordaitalean conifers, alongside medullosalean cycads and callistophytalean seed ferns, with an undergrowth of lycophytes and ferns. Additionally, a forest dominated by walchian conifers (Voltziales) would be present but more distant from the lake. Vegetation dynamics between these associations are generally stable, except for an increase in Cordaitales at the expense of Voltziales. This variation, observed throughout the Autun Basin, seems to be affected by seasonal climate-driven changes. The co-occurrence in both assemblages of Permian xerophytic elements accompanied by Carboniferous wetland flora suggests a seasonally dry climate, supporting hygrophyte plant survival, persisting for at least 300 ky after the Carboniferous-Permian boundary. The phytoplankton community consisted of freshwater green algae, increasing towards the upper part of the section, coeval with increased explosive volcanic activity. Wind-transported volcanic ash likely provided nutrient input, enhancing lacustrine phytoplankton growth.

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of temperature fluctuations on trophic levels through various interdisciplinary coupling analysis methods after land use change, which including water and sediment sample analysis, hydraulic model, remote sensing, and historic data analysis. For the historical analysis, six satellite images of Lake Dianshan were examined to assess algal bloom occurrences and the coverage of Eichhornia crassipes from 2013 to 2023. The correlation between trophic indicators and temperature was analyzed using statistical methods. For the monthly analysis, a total of 27 sediment samples and 54 water samples collected from Lake Dianshan were assessed to determine how seasonal temperature variations influence eutrophication status. The trophic indicators have higher concentration at inlet sampling sites compared to outlet sites, which validated the potential external pollution source. The trophic level of Lake Dianshan is influenced not only by climate change but also significantly by urban human activities. The management of eutrophication has substantially improved the water quality of Lake Dianshan over the past few decades. Furthermore, increasing temperatures demonstrate a positive correlation with the proliferation of cyanobacteria, particularly in urban areas.

Conventional temperature profile based models of HSC require location specific parameters such as lakebed topography. Based on the half-order time-derivative formula of heat fluxes, an analytical model was formulated for estimating HSC from water surface temperature and solar radiation without using geography dependent parameters. The proposed model was tested against field measurements at Poyang Lake, a shallow inland lake, which has pronounced seasonal variations in water level and lake area. Our analysis indicates that the model accurately simulates diurnal HSC with a coefficient of determination of 0.94 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 77.5 +/- 21.6 Wm-2 for the study period. Larger nighttime RMSE (75.0 +/- 26.8 Wm-2) than the daytime value (55.1 +/- 19.7 W m-2) is attributable to larger measurement errors of nighttime turbulent fluxes. The estimation of HSC independent of temperature profile and lake-specific parameters by the proposed model facilitates remote sensing monitoring the HSC of global water bodies.					; Wang, Ruonan/KFB-1139-2024	Cui, Yifan/0000-0003-2541-7737; xing, wanqiu/0000-0002-1714-1809; LIU, Yuanbo/0000-0002-8780-927X													0043-1397	1944-7973				JAN	2025	61	1							e2024WR038269	10.1029/2024WR038269	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024WR038269													WOS:001397066100001

This study employed stable isotope analysis to assess the trophic dynamics of three fish species (Parabramis pekinensis, Carassius auratus, and Toxabramis swinhonis) across different water periods in Hongze Lake. The findings revealed that all three species occupied similar mid-level trophic positions, with no significant difference among water periods (p > 0.05). During high-water periods, P. pekinensis and T. swinhonis exploited broader niches, while C. auratus relied on a narrower diet. In contrast, during low-water periods, C. auratus expanded its niche, while P. pekinensis and T. swinhonis reduced their isotopic niche widths. Niche overlap analysis showed minimal trophic overlap among the three species during high-water periods, with increased overlap during low-water periods, except for the highest overlap between C. auratus and T. swinhonis during mid-water periods. This variation in niche overlap aligns with shifts in dietary reliance, as POM was the predominant dietary component for all three species, but its contribution varied significantly across different water periods. These findings indicated that adaptive trophic niche facilitated the coexistence of these fish species, while off-seasonal water level regulation may intensify interspecific competition. These insights are essential for refining water management policies and developing sustainable fishery management strategies of Hongze Lake and other water-level-regulated systems.					yang, ruiqi/LXA-1598-2024; Zhao, Shengyu/HIR-8349-2022	Shiyu, Jin/0000-0002-8742-7853													2076-2615					JAN	2025	15	1							59	10.3390/ani15010059	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani15010059								39795002					WOS:001394897700001

Seasonal Dynamics and Environmental Drivers of Phytoplankton in the Albufera Coastal Lagoon (Valencia, Spain)	ENVIRONMENTS												The Albufera of Valencia is a hypereutrophic, oligohaline lagoon that has experienced significant changes in phytoplankton composition and state in recent decades due to human activities. These activities affect phytoplankton biomass and community structure, which are key indicators of ecosystem health. In this study, phytoplankton samples from the lagoon were analyzed to identify dominant groups and genera, and their seasonal cycles were determined using biovolume measurements with the Uterm & ouml;hl method. Various environmental variables were also measured. Diversity was assessed using richness, equitability, and the Shannon-Wiener index. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) and Pearson correlation revealed that temperature and phosphorus significantly influence phytoplankton abundance. A species that exhibited seasonal abundance, resulting in a change in the lagoon's color from green to brown, was identified. Water quality was assessed using the trophic state index, indicating that the lagoon is in poor condition and hyper-eutrophic. Cyanobacteria were the most dominant group, peaking in November, contrary to previous studies, followed by Chlorophyceae and Bacillariophyceae. Phytoplankton are vital bioindicators for assessing ecosystem health, underscoring the need for further research in this area.					; Soria, Juan/M-1699-2014	Molner, Juan Victor/0009-0003-3855-3313; Soria, Juan/0000-0001-5249-8590														2076-3298				JAN	2025	12	1							23	10.3390/environments12010023	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/environments12010023													WOS:001405343700001

The annual mean in Lough Neagh increased by 0.429 degrees C decade-1 and the monthly mean in all months, except June, at an average of 0.368 degrees C decade-1. The annual mean at a 60m water depth site (LE1) in Lower Lough Erne increased by 0.372 degrees C decade(-1), but only in June at 1.072 degrees C decade-1, although with indications for January and October. At a 10m site (LE4), the annual mean increased at over twice that rate, 0.848 degrees C decade(-1), in January, September, October and December, at an average monthly rate of 1.358 degrees C decade-1. Based on the evidence from Lough Neagh, Lower Lough Erne and Lough Feeagh, supported by the literature, it is likely that the annual mean temperature of many Irish lakes has increased by 0.18 to 0.43 degrees C decade-1 over the last three to five decades. In addition, differences in the seasonal pattern of warming are possible. In Lough Neagh, the duration of lower temperatures needed for the breeding of Mysis salemaai decreased and the duration of higher temperatures that cause mortality increased over the 1969-2022 period, causing an increasing stress on the population.																			0791-7945	2009-003X					2025	125B									10.1353/bae.00001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/bae.00001													WOS:001457759400001

Although high-resolution remote sensing imagery has been used to develop methods for the automatic extraction of aquatic vegetation, these methods are usually limited to specific areas (such as a lake or a river). Extracting aquatic vegetation on a large scale faces numerous challenges, including high environmental complexity, significant seasonal variations, and poor cross-regional adaptability. Currently, relying solely on either prior knowledge-based methods or classifier methods makes it difficult to comprehensively capture the complex characteristics and variations of aquatic vegetation. To address this issue, we propose an expert feature embedded deep semantic segmentation model. This model uses an attention mechanism to fuse expert features with deep features, dynamically adjusting and optimizing the weight allocation between them. This enables the model to better capture the subtle differences among various types of aquatic vegetation and environmental changes. Specifically, we propose a feature fusion module based on the squeeze-and-excitation coordinate attention mechanism. This module initially employs the squeeze and-excitation mechanism to compress spectral and index features, generating adjusted weights alpha and beta. Subsequently, it dynamically adjusts the combined weights of these features through the coordinate attention mechanism. We selected eight regions in Anhui Province for evaluation. Compared to HRNet, our method improved Precision and IoU by 10.91% and 20.72%, respectively. Finally, using Anhui Province as the study area, we produced a province-scale aquatic vegetation density map. The results indicate that there are approximately 25.78 km(2) of aquatic vegetation in Anhui Province.					; Zhang, Peng/JVO-3558-2024	Zhang, Peng/0000-0002-9062-9448; Wu, Yanlan/0000-0002-8983-3150; 													1939-1404	2151-1535					2025	18						1752	1765		10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3507023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3507023													WOS:001380708600006

Production activities in the industrial park in this special geographical environment may exacerbate its environmental vulnerability. We examined the spatial and temporal patterns of water quality parameters, identified the factors influencing water quality, and evaluated the associated risks using various analytical methods, including the Boruta algorithm and interval fuzzy number-based set-pair analysis (IFN-SPA). The results showed that the average concentrations in the flood season and dry season were significantly different. The average value of Cd in the flood season belonged to the water quality standard of Class II. Different heavy metals show different spatial distribution characteristics, and the reason for the difference comes from livestock farms and industrial enterprises. The results for the flood season and dry season were different, which further proves that meteorological factors can influence water quality. The risk of heavy metals in different rivers presents different spatial distribution characteristics; for example, the risk of heavy metals in the Sigou River is higher. The water quality assessment results indicate the need to develop a well-structured evaluation framework for managing and controlling river water pollution in the future.

Spatial diffusion, spatial heterogeneity, nonlocal effective contact (this property can be described by some integral functions), and seasonal patterns have been identified in the infection mechanism of schistosomiasis. In this paper, we formulated a spatial diffusion schistosomiasis model with seasonal and nonlocal transmissions to investigate the impact of interesting factors on the transmission dynamics of schistosomiasis. We derived the functional expression of the next generation operator, R(x), and defined the basic reproduction number, R-0, as the spectral radius of R(x). We also showed that the threshold dynamics of the system are determined by R-0. Specifically the schistosomiasis-free periodic steady state is global attractive when R-0 < 1 and the uniform persistence of the disease holds for R-0 > 1. Numerical simulations were conducted to verified the theoretical results and investigate the influences of factor factors on schistosomiasis transmissions. Our works suggest that schistosomiasis is less prevalent in regions where rivers have fast currents than in those with slow currents. Thus, government departments should consider the spatial heterogeneity and take corresponding control measures for different river and lake basins.					; fang, chen/MNO-4189-2025	wu, peng/0000-0002-1971-720X; 													1531-3492	1553-524X				JUN	2025	30	7					2483	2513		10.3934/dcdsb.2024174	http://dx.doi.org/10.3934/dcdsb.2024174		DEC 2024											WOS:001371485400001

Knowledge of the villagers' perceptions and the composition of the waste from their boathouses will contribute to constructing a waste collection system with community participation within the framework of waste prevention and reduction. This study surveyed residents living in boathouses in four floating villages on TS Lake, Cambodia, regarding their perceptions and boathouse waste composition to assess the status of plastic waste and the villagers' environmental awareness and their willingness to participate in waste collection. The household waste survey sought to clarify the amount of plastic waste and other recyclable waste discharged from floating houses. The perception survey revealed that in the wet season, 36% of respondents disposed of plastic waste by open burning/dumping and 40% by discharge into TS Lake; in the dry season, 76% disposed of waste by open burning/dumping, and only 4% discharged waste into TS Lake. An analysis of the boathouse plastic waste composition showed that residents of the floating villages generated 40.21 g plastic waste/day/capita, which was much lower than 340 g/day/capita in the USA, 120 g/day/capita in China, and even 70 g/day/capita in Cambodian on average, but higher than the 10 g/day/capita in India. This study proposes a novel and valuable framework to estimate and determine the level of awareness of people in floating villages related to plastic pollution effects and waste components from boathouses. At the same time, the research results provide an essential scientific basis to be able to develop an effective waste collection system in the area of TS Lake. The proposed framework of this study will help the policy decision-makers in the TS Lake area and those in similar geographical regions facing similar problems.

Our findings identify four pollen zones, from base to top, as follows: Zone I of terminal Miocene to the middle Early Pliocene age (similar to 4.0-5.5 Ma), characterized by a mixed forest-meadow vegetation consisting of coniferous and broad-leaved trees representing alternating colder and warmer climates that were generally mild and semi-humid; Zone II of Early to Late Pliocene age (similar to 2.6-4.0 Ma), dominated mostly by arboreal pollen representing a generally humid climate; Zone III of Early Pleistocene age (similar to 1.6-2.6 Ma), characterized by a significant increase in terrestrial herbaceous and shrub pollen types, notably Poaceae, Ephedraceae, Artemisia, and Chenopodiaceae, reflecting a climate trend towards dryness and cold; and Zone IV of late Early Pleistocene to present (similar to 0-1.6 Ma), characterized by the alternate dominance of arboreal and herbaceous pollen types, indicating fluctuating periods of warm-wet and cold-dry climates. These pollen assemblages are consistent with the global climate transition from warm Late Miocene to Pliocene conditions to the glacial-interglacial cycles of the latest Pliocene and Pleistocene. Pollen analysis shows that the ratio of arboreal and herbaceous pollen types gradually changed, after similar to 3 Ma, with a decline in arboreal pollen and an increase in herbaceous pollen. This trend is consistent with the evolution of C-3-C-4 vegetation types, as revealed by black carbon delta C-13 values in the southwestern Japan Sea. We also show that the lakes of the Taiyuan Basin, which likely originated during the Early Pliocene and achieved their maximum extent at similar to 4 Ma, subsequently, underwent shrinkage, in response to Pleistocene climate drying.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				FEB 1	2025	659								112675	10.1016/j.palaeo.2024.112675	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2024.112675		DEC 2024											WOS:001396240400001

Hara (Hydrocharitaceae) to increasing nutrient loadings	JOURNAL OF BASIC MICROBIOLOGY												To investigate the effects of water column nutrient loading on epiphytic bacteria, we determined the abundance and community composition of epiphytic bacteria on the submerged macrophyte Vallisneria natans (Lour.) Hara during the growth season (June-October) under four different nutrient concentrations (nitrogen (N)-phosphorus (P) in mg L-1: 0.5-0.05, 1.0-0.1, 5.0-0.5, 10.0-1.0; hereafter NP-1, NP-2, NP-3, NP-4, respectively), using epifluorescence microscopy method and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis, respectively. Relative to low nutrient conditions (NP-1), there was no significant effect on the epiphytic bacterial community, and even a decrease in the number of epiphytic bacteria, which linked to the well growth status of host macrophytes at moderate nutrient conditions (NP-2). However, further nutrient enrichment induced significant increase in the abundance of epiphytic bacteria, and marked changes in the community structures of epiphytic bacteria. Furthermore, at high nutrient conditions, epiphytic bacterial communities varied widely temporally, and were not stable compared with those at the lower nutrient conditions. These results indicated that the effects of nutrient enrichment on epiphytic bacteria were nonlinear and dependent on the nutrient concentrations in the water.

Notes on Chelodina mccordi timorensis Biology, Harvest, Current Threats, and Community Perceptions in the Lake Iralalaro Region, Timor-Leste	CHELONIAN CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY												The long-necked turtle Chelodina mccordi is considered Critically Endangered under IUCN Red List criteria. In Timor-Leste, the subspecies Chelodina mccordi timorensis is restricted to a small area of lacustrine habitat near the eastern tip of Timor around Lake Iralalaro in the Lautem District. We collected information on C. m. timorensis biology and harvest and assessed current threats and community perceptions. Data were collected during 2 surveys (February and July 2014) around Lake Iralalaro in Nino Konis Santana National Park. Threats were identified by direct observation, and local perceptions were recorded during expert interviews. Human harvest is the main threat in the area. Animals are captured using fishing line, are located using a bamboo stick in shallow water to probe the mud, or are captured by hand at the edge of the lake or under dry grass. Turtles are captured mainly during the dry season (April to October). Most experts identified C. m. timorensis under 2 different names according to the color (staining) of the plastron (veu = yellow and clear; sepe veu = dark and red). Local perspectives as to the population status of the turtle (stable, declining, or increasing) varied between 2 villages. Factors that may be reducing the capacity of this turtle to survive human harvest include predation by pigs and dogs. Fire and climate change are also likely to be important factors resulting in declines.

J	Hamidi, SA; Ghanbari, RN				Hamidi, Sajad Ahmad; Ghanbari, Reza Namdar			Multi-decadal and multi-centennial variability in Colorado River streamflow	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT												A 1240-year-long record of reconstructed annual flows of the Colorado River at Lees Ferry is analysed using singular spectrum analysis and multi-taper method of spectral analysis. Spectral analysis of the 100-year-long recent record of annual flows of Colorado River in the measured and reconstructed forms shows similar oscillations in high-and low-frequency bands. Therefore, the oscillatory components and trends extracted from the reconstructed data are a good representative of inter-annual, multi-decadal, and multi-centennial variability of natural flow in the river. In Colorado River the length of flow data is 1240 years and multi-centennial and multi-decadal oscillatory components can be extracted at a high confidence level. In this research we attempt to find whether the changes in streamflow in the twentieth century are due to an external cause such as climate change or whether they are part of the natural variability of flow observed in the past. The results suggest that there is only a part of the linear trend, caused by climate change or man-made effects, and an important part of that is due to climate variability which is believed to be totally natural. The same line of climate variability is still acting on our planet, and it may have gained new aspects due to the change in atmospheric composition and circulation as a result of anthropogenic effects. This may cause serious limitations to the water sustainability and water availability on the earth.

The evolution of the annual lake budget is related to the precipitation variability. However a marked increase in the excess after 1961 is shown, which corresponds to a change in the relationship between annual excess and precipitation, which further corresponds to a higher effectiveness of rainfall. This marked change in the lake water budget could partly correspond to wetter conditions at the beginning of the rainy season, but the man-induced changes in land use and in the surface runoff conditions appear partly responsible for the difference in the lake sensitivity to precipitation.					; Richard, Yves/F-1874-2011	Camberlin, Pierre/0000-0003-4896-2332; 													0262-6667					OCT	2002	47	5					781	796		10.1080/02626660209492980	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626660209492980													WOS:000178362700008

The sagitta of the otolith was arrowhead-shaped with an obvious nucleus. Increments in the sagittae were observable until the bases of the rostra but invisible in the rostra. The asteriscus was oval-shaped with an ambiguous nucleus, leading to difficulty in identifying the first increment. The lapillus was 'a'-shaped with an obvious nucleus and increments were observable from the nucleus to the margin. The lapillus was therefore considered the most suitable structure for interpreting daily growth increments in this species. The estimated hatching months of fish based on lapilli increment counts were from November to July, suggesting that this species has a long breeding period of at least eight months per year. The growth rate of fish born in the rainy season (0.74 mm TL per day) was higher than those in the dry season (0.56 mm TL per day). This growth difference was considered to be due to the difference in water temperature in the lake.																			1562-7020					OCT	2002	37	2					165	170																WOS:000180512900007

They re facing increasing pressure from land and water resources development and, whilst they are considered to be still in relatively good, condition,no studies have yet been carried out to verify this. Such baseline studies are crucial if we are,to assess any ecological changes in response to development and management interventions. The ecological condition of four of these endorheic rivers (Georgina, Diamantina, Cooper-Thomson and Bulloo) flowing into the Lake Eyre and Bulloo Basins in central Australia was assessed using several criteria (level of human influence, habitat condition, water chemistry and aquatic macroinvertebrate composition). Using criteria based on the level of human influence, most of the sites were assessed to be relatively unimpacted (reference) condition. The most discernible and widespread impact was riparian and bank damage by stock access. However, the level of this impact was considered to be only moderate. Most aquatic macroinvertebrates found in the area are considered to be opportunistic and tolerant of a Wide range of environmental conditions, but with their life histories known to be linked to flow conditions. Their trophic guild was dominated by collectors and predators. The AusRivAS modelled observed to expected values of macroinvertebrate composition indicated that there were differences in ecological condition between sites (e.g. different waterholes) and between times (e.g: seasons and years). Overall, 75% of sites were assessed to be good condition with the remainder being mildly impaired. Water chemistry of the sites was characterised by high spatial and temporal variability With low-conductivity and alkaline pH, relatively high turbidity, total nitrogen and total phosphorus, and wide-ranging dissolved oxygen. Given the high variability in water quality and ecological condition within a catchment, there Was little evidence of any overall difference in these factors between the catchments. However, given that the hydrology of each river system is distinctly different, one might expect some differences in ecological structure and function at finer scale. Periods of hydrological isolation (eg. to allow natural dryouts) as well as the maintenance of natural connectivity (eg. instream, overbank and floodplain wetting) are both necessary for the maintenance of ecological integrity of these systems.

The harvest has ranged from 0.7-4.7 kg.ha(-1). The catch per trap night decreased prior to 1991 and the yield was reduced by some 50% over the years 1987-1992 as compared to 1979-1986. This was due to removal of small crayfish, high exploitation and the establishment of dense stands of Canadian pondweed (Elodea canadensis). Baited traps catch a large fraction of crayfish < 95 mm total length minimum size. These should according to the regulations immediately be released into the lake. However, it is apparent from the size composition that release of these small crayfish was rather incomplete. In 1983, trap mesh size was increased from 17.5 mm to 21 mm to reduce the fraction of undersized crayfish in the trap catches, yet no effects of this increased mesh size on crayfish size distribution were observed. The legal season has been reduced three times during the study period. In 1983, the closing date was changed from 31 December to 15 September. In 1989 the legal season was further reduced to two weeks and finally in 1995 to 10 days. This reduced total trap effort by 45%. The shorter season allow many crayfish to moult twice instead of once between seasons and the fraction of large crayfish has thus increased and so has the catch per trap night. Canadian pondweed has established dense annual stands and thus has made large parts of the shallow areas unsuitable for crayfish, causing an overall decrease in crayfish population size and production.																			0767-2861						2002		367					845	860		10.1051/kmae:2002072	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/kmae:2002072													WOS:000180910600021
J	BACH, HK				BACH, HK			A DYNAMIC-MODEL DESCRIBING THE SEASONAL-VARIATIONS IN GROWTH AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF EELGRASS (ZOSTERA-MARINA L) .1. MODEL-THEORY	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												In shallow coastal areas eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) can have an important influence on the biological structure. As a reflection of this a general eutrophication model for coastal marine areas has been extended to include the seasonal variations in growth of eelgrass. The basic model describes the growth of phytoplankton and zooplankton and the nutrient dynamics. The important factors controlling eelgrass growth and distribution are included in the model: water transparency, water temperature, and water depth/topography of the water bed. Factors such as growth of epiphytes on eelgrass leaves and grazing birds and invertebrates are omitted. The eelgrass submodel describes seasonal and regional variations in production and biomass of above and below ground parts. The phytoplankton and eelgrass submodels interrelate, especially at the point of water transparency, since water transparency depends on the phytoplankton (chlorophyll-a) concentration. The model has been developed and calibrated based on data from a shallow area around the island of Masnedo in the southern part of Denmark. Data on phytoplankton, zooplankton and eelgrass production and biomass as well as nutrient status and important forcing functions were collected over a period of 1 year. The developed model was found to be able to describe the variations in the data material in a satisfying way.																			0304-3800					JAN	1993	65	1-2					31	50		10.1016/0304-3800(93)90125-C	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3800(93)90125-C													WOS:A1993KL67900002

However, the limited range, due to much higher propagation loss and smaller wave heights (relative to the saltwater ocean), has discouraged HF radar use over fresh water. Nevertheless, the potential usefulness of UF radar in measuring circulation patterns in freshwater lakes has stimulated pilot experiments to explore HF radar capabilities over fresh water. The Episodic Events Great Lakes Experiment (EEGLE), which studied the impact of intermittent strong wind events on the resuspension of pollutants from lake-bottom sediments, provided an excellent venue for a pilot experiment. A Multifrequency Coastal HF Radar (MCR) was deployed for 10 days at two sites on the shore of Lake Michigan near St. Joseph, MI. Similarly, a single-frequency CODAR SeaSonde instrument was deployed on the California shore of Lake Tahoe, These two experiments showed that when sufficiently strong surface winds (greater than or equal to about 7 m/s) exist for an hour or more, a single HF radar can be effective in measuring the radial component of surface currents out to ranges of 10-15 km. We also show the effectiveness of using HF radar in concert with acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) for measuring a radial component of the current profile to depths as shallow as 50 cm and thus potentially extending the vertical coverage of an ADCP array.																			0364-9059	1558-1691				OCT	2000	25	4					458	471		10.1109/48.895353	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/48.895353													WOS:000166603500006

Phycocyanin (PC), a distinctive pigment found in cyanobacteria, plays a pivotal role in detecting and predicting harmful cyanobacterial blooms. A novel segmented PC concentration remote sensing inversion model was developed using the support vector regression (SVR) algorithm and Sentinel-3 OLCI data to examine the spatiotemporal variations in PC concentrations across 11 representative lakes in Northeast China. The model showed high accuracy (PC <= 45 mu g/L: R-2 = 0.882, MAPE = 34.53 %, MAE = 3.96 mu g/L; PC > 45 mu g/L: R-2 = 0.814, MAPE = 31.80 %, MAE = 70.58 mu g/L). Significant variations in PC concentrations were observed across the watersheds in Northeast China. Over seven years, the PC concentrations declined in half of the lakes. Although no significant changes in the annual average PC concentrations were noticed, intra-annual fluctuations were observed. Seasonal patterns in PC concentrations were also observed. The contribution rates of natural and anthropogenic factors were determined using spatiotemporal data on PC concentrations from 2016 to 2022 and redundancy analysis. The primary drivers of PC concentrations varied across different spatial and temporal scales. These findings highlight the monitoring of PC concentrations in the lakes of Northeast China using Sentinel-3 OLCI images. This study can provide valuable insights for water quality management authorities, enabling them to understand the changing characteristics and trends of PC concentrations and to issue early warnings of cyanobacterial blooms.

J	Tallberg, P; Koski-Vähälä, J				Tallberg, P; Koski-Vähälä, J			Silicate-induced phosphate release from surface sediment in eutrophic lakes	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The magnitude and implications of Si-induced release of P from surface sediment in eutrophic lakes from Southern Finland was studied by means of laboratory experiments and field observations. In the laboratory experiments, the impact of differ ent-sized additions of dissolved Si (0-50mg/l sed. Si) on the desorption of P in four lake sediments was quantified with the aid of linear regression. Additions of Si principally seemed to induce release of P (max. 300 mug/l interstitial water) adsorbed to Fe-oxides, and the magnitude and pattern of the process was thus mainly governed by the availability of Fe-oxides and of P adsorbed to these. In the sediments relatively richer in Al-oxides, resorption of released P occurred, diminishing the Si-induced effects at the lower concentrations of added Si. The field data on the temporal variation in the dissolved Si concentration and diatom composition of the water column in three lakes was used to estimate the potential maximal size of the Si pulses reaching the sediment in situ (28-97mg/l sed. Si). When the regressions from the laboratory experiments were combined with these Si pulses and with data on the dissolved P in the water column, estimates for the Si-induced release of P from the surface sediment into the water column (0.2-1.4 mg m(-2) d(-1) P) were obtained (with Fick's Law). These Si-induced P fluxes may be of local and temporal significance in eutrophic lakes with sediments rich in Fe-bound P, particularly if massive diatom and cyanobacterial blooms accompanied by high pH values occur.																			0003-9136					MAY	2001	151	2					221	245																WOS:000169015400003
J	FEUNTEUN, E; MARION, L				FEUNTEUN, E; MARION, L			ASSESSMENT OF GRAY HERON PREDATION ON FISH COMMUNITIES - THE CASE OF THE LARGEST EUROPEAN COLONY	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The fish predation rate by Grey Heron Ardea cinerea was studied during two breeding seasons (1987-88) in the largest European colony at the Lake of Grand-Lieu (Loire-Atlantique, France). The herons' diet was compared to the available fish population of its main feeding area, the marsh of Bourgneuf (16000 ha) which is composed of former salt pans and meadows drained by a dense network of shallow ditches. This study is the first attempt to assess the predation exerted by an ardeid colony on a fish community over such an extensive natural environment. It also provides the first data about the abundance and the structure of fish communities in shallow coastal dyked marshes. For this purpose, two different sampling methods were used according to the water's salinity. In fresh waters, electrofishing was used as the removal method, and density estimates were calculated with Carle & Strub estimator (1978). Fish were caught in randomly selected stations (sections of ditches enclosed by two 5 mm mesh nets). In brackish waters, pools and ditches were drained. The distribution of the herons at the feeding areas was determined by direct observations, by counting flights from the colony, and by radio-tracking. The diet was investigated by observing adult herons on the foraging areas, and by analyzing the prey regurgitations of the young at the nests. The global food consumption was assessed from Marion (1988), according to the birds' activity determined during 5 years of radio-tracking. Altogether, at least 39 species of fish were available in the herons' feeding area (during the reference period, 87-88) and the mean fish biomass was 270 kg per ha of open water, or 30 kg per ha of marsh (open water = 11.2% of the marsh area). The fish community was dominated by eel Anguilla anguilla (145 kg ha-1, 50,8% of the total biomass), and catfish Ictalurus melas (40 kg ha-1, 14%). Except for small and inaccessible species (living in the deepest parts of the marsh), heron diet was very similar to fish species composition of the community occurring in the marsh. The catfish was the species captured most frequently by the heron (45% of the mass), the eel was second with 28% of the mass. The catfish was probably over represented in the diet considering that they are caught in catfish-dumps created by professional fishermen at Grand-Lieu lake, in order to reduce the density of this undesirable species. Inversely, small species such as Gasterosteus aculeatus were not found in the diet whereas they are very numerous in the marsh. On average herons of Grand-Lieu colony catch 1.92 kg of fish per ha of marsh (6% of the fish standing crops in the marsh) during the breeding season, the main predation period.

J	Kioko, C; Blanford, J				Kioko, Caroline; Blanford, Justine			Malaria survey data and geospatial suitability mapping for understanding spatial and temporal variations of risk across Kenya	PARASITE EPIDEMIOLOGY AND CONTROL												Malaria remains a public health concern in Kenya where children and pregnant women are vulnerable groups. The common interventions in place to fight malaria include using insecticidetreated bed nets (ITNs), knowledge and awareness about malaria, and intake of malaria antimalaria drugs. Despite the availability of these interventions, Kenya still records more than 10,000 clinical cases annually. In this study, we examined how malaria and interventions varied across Kenya for 2015 and 2020. We analyzed the Kenya Malaria Indicator Survey (N = 10,072) for 2015 and, (N = 11,549) for 2020, and climate data with Fuzzy overlay method to examine how malaria and its interventions relate to environmental conditions required for malaria. The study found that 79 % of malaria cases were distributed in lake endemic, 11 % in coastal endemic, 7 % in highland epidemic, and 3 % in seasonal zone. Use of Insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) was 77 % in lake endemic, 13 % in coastal endemic, 9 % in highland epidemic, and 1 % in seasonal zone. Knowledge about malaria was 82 % in lake endemic, 9 % in highland epidemic, 6 % in coastal endemic, and 3 % in seasonal zone. Additionally, based on climate data, lake endemic zone was 94 % suitable for malaria transmission compared to other zones. Despite the use of ITNs and awareness about malaria, malaria transmission continues to be a threat especially in counties in the lake endemic zone. Furthermore, place of residence, climate factors, ownership of ITNs may be associated with malaria in the region.

J	Singh, P; Yadav, B				Singh, Pooja; Yadav, Basant			Seasonal eutrophication in lentic small waterbodies: Understanding nutrients-chlorophyll-a relationships and implications	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS ADVANCES												Assessing seasonal variations in pollution within lentic small waterbodies (LSWBs) is crucial, particularly in regions with significant temperature and rainfall fluctuations, as these variations are driven by natural and anthropogenic inputs from both point and non-point sources. This study assesses the seasonal dynamics of physicochemical parameters and their impact on the trophic status of lentic small waterbodies (LSWBs). Using statistical modeling, including regression analysis, it explores chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) as a proxy for eutrophication and establishes empirical relationships between nutrients (TN, TP) and Chl-a based on data collected from December 2022 to November 2023. The ratios of total nitrogen (TN) to total phosphorus (TP) were analysed to understand the conditions that limit phytoplankton biomass production. Nutrient (TN, TP)-Chl-a correlations were established to explain seasonal eutrophication in these waterbodies. Furthermore, the trophic level index (TLI) was employed to assess the eutrophication status across seasons. The results suggest that LSWBs are the most polluted during the monsoon season, characterised by low Secchi disk depth (SDD) and dissolved oxygen (DO), along with high TN/TP concentrations from domestic sewage and agricultural runoff. Nutrient (TN:TP) ratios and their correlations with Chl-a suggest that TN (<10) primarily affects algal growth, especially during monsoons. TN:TP ratio displayed a notable rise in the post-monsoon season for all three LSWBs. TLI assessment indicated a general deterioration in water quality from oligotrophic (0 to 30) to hypertrophic (70 to 100) conditions in the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Our findings highlight the importance of accounting for limitation-specific, season-specific, and type-specific correlations between algal biomass and environmental factors. By subdividing water bodies for type-specific management, the research offers a framework to address the limitations in interpreting empirical nutrient-Chl-a relationships. These findings contribute to more accurate, site-specific management strategies for mitigating eutrophication, advancing both regional and global efforts to protect freshwater ecosystems.

However, it remains unknown how global change and regional human activities will affect carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from inland waters in large river basins. Here, we quantify the seasonal surface water area, CO2 flux and annual CO2 emissions from lotic and lentic systems throughout the Yangtze River Basin during the 1980s and 2010s. We also employ the Random Forest model to assess the relative importance of various natural and anthropogenic factors on riverine CO2 partial pressure (pCO2). Our results indicate an expansion in reservoirs (+2680 km2 in water surface area) and a decline in river and lake areas (-1702 km2) between the 1980s and 2010s. We observe a substantial decline in CO2 emissions, decreasing from 52.69 +/- 13.11 Tg C yr- 1 in the 1980s to 31.20 +/- 5.37 Tg C yr- 1 in the 2010s. Our findings suggest a diminished influence of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on riverine pCO2, coupled with the growing importance of natural factors (latitude, temperature and soil types), reflecting a significant shift from anthropogenic to natural control over river CO2 levels. This study highlights the importance of comprehending the intricate interactions between human activities and inland-water CO2 emissions in developing countries, which may contribute to the achievement of carbon neutrality goals.

Food habits of nonnative Walleyes in Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												ObjectiveWalleye Sander vitreus is an important species that has been widely introduced outside of its native distribution. The goal of this study was to assess the effects of an established Walleye population in the Lake Pend Oreille (LPO) system, Idaho.MethodsFood habits of Walleyes were described using stomach contents and stable isotopes (delta 15N, delta 13C). Trophic structure of the LPO system's food web was identified using stable isotopes. Annual consumption by Walleyes of important prey items was estimated using a bioenergetics model.ResultWalleyes consumed a diversity of prey items, including macroinvertebrates and fishes. Kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka, the most frequently consumed prey item, occurred in 23% of all Walleye diets. Combined, native cyprinids and catostomids occurred in 31% of all Walleye stomachs. Select taxa (e.g., native cyprinids, kokanee) were consistently consumed by Walleyes across seasons, regions, and cohorts, whereas other taxa (e.g., Westslope Cutthroat Trout O. lewisi, Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu) were consumed inconsistently. Stable isotope analysis suggested that Walleyes occupied similar trophic positions as other top-level piscivores in the system. As Walleye age increased, delta 15N increased and delta 13C decreased, indicating increased consumption of pelagic prey resources and prey at higher trophic positions. The estimated biomass of kokanee consumed annually by Walleyes was 27,121 kg (95% confidence interval = 9178-61,603). Comparatively, native cyprinids represented about 46% of the total biomass of kokanee consumed by Walleyes, whereas native catostomids represented about 11% and native salmonids represented about 15% of the total biomass of kokanee consumed by Walleyes.ConclusionThis study revealed that Walleyes consumed various fishes across the LPO system. Although kokanee were the most frequently consumed prey item, native cyprinids and catostomids (combined) occurred at similar proportions. This study contributes to our growing knowledge of the effects of nonnative Walleyes on important salmonids and native fishes in western systems.

The aim was to obtain knowledge concerning the input of these contaminants to the Skagerrak via atmospheric transport and deposition. The measurements showed a continuous deposition of POP, here represented by PAH, PCB and HCH, to the sea surface of the Skagerrak and an important episodic input in connection with long-range air transport especially together with precipitation. However, the deposition fluxes may also be affected by local sources. A seasonal variation was observed in the concentrations of the different compounds in both air and deposition. The deposited amounts of the selected compounds were within the same order of magnitude at the coastal and sea-based stations but there were differences in the deposition on the individual sampling occasions. There were minor geographical variations with a somewhat greater deposition of HCH and PAH in the southern part of Skagerrak.																			1385-1101					FEB	1996	35	1-3					81	90		10.1016/S1385-1101(96)90737-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1385-1101(96)90737-6													WOS:A1996UR70200009

Because striped bass produce a superabundance of eggs, only a small portion of the total egg production must develop in favorable nursery habitat to produce good recruitment in any year. In a 3-year study, we assessed temporal variability in egg mortality, compared the survival of progeny cohorts, and monitored abundance of juveniles and zooplankton in nursery areas. Growth rates and hatch dates of juveniles were estimated from otoliths. Mortality rates and hatching locations varied among egg cohorts. In the best recruitment years, 1988 and 1990, highest survival was associated with eggs hatched during the early half of the spawning season in Lake Marion. Zooplankton densities were higher in Lake Marion than in the spawning tributaries, suggesting that the lake was a superior nursery habitat. Growth rate of juveniles was highest in 1990. Water management at upstream dams in the Santee-Cooper system might increase recruitment by optimizing temperature and flow so that the maximum possible number of eggs hatch in upper Lake Marion.

J	Gosselin, DC				Gosselin, DC			Major-ion chemistry of compositionally diverse lakes, Western Nebraska, USA: Implications for paleoclimatic interpretations	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY					Session on Modern and Ancient Lake Environments of the Great Plains, at the Geological-Society-of-America Meeting	APR 27-28, 1995	LINCOLN, NE	Geol Soc Amer				The western Sand Hills, Nebraska, contains hundreds of compositionally diverse lakes with total dissolved solids ranging from 200 mg l(-1) to over 100 000 mg l(-1) on occasion. This region has a semi-arid, mid-continental climate that is likely to be sensitive to future changes in climate. To interpret the record of Holocene climate in the lake sediments using available paleolimnological techniques, especially proxies for geochemical variations such as diatoms. ostracodes, and authigenic carbonates, requires an understanding of the modern spatial and temporal variability in lake chemistry. This paper provides: (1) a general description of the region and its many lakes; (2) a review of previous investigations related to the origin of these lakes; (3) major-ion data collected in 1992 and 1993 for 27 lakes in Sheridan County, NE; and (4) a discussion of these data in relation to a qualitative conceptual model, implications for lake history, and interpretations of paleoclimatic indicators that employ Mg/Ca ratios. Implications of the data include: (1) compositional differences between lakes are a function of local hydrologic variability, largely the magnitude of the input and output components and the lakes lifetime; (2) the lifetime of a lake is likely related to the complex geomorphic and hydrologic development of the ancestral Blue Creek basin; and (3) solutes in these lakes were not acquired from a high TDS groundwater source. The observed concentrations can be produced by evaporatively concentrating local groundwater. The available Mg and Ca data indicate that for low salinity lakes (e.g., Dillings and Krause lakes) there is a systematic relationship between seasonal increases in Mg/Ca ratios and salinity. Analyses of single ostracodes of the same species could provide a detailed record of seasonal salinity variations, as well as year-to-year hydrologic variability. In the more saline lakes (e.g., Potash, Shriner, Homestead, UNNJ, Wilkinson lakes), the Mg/Ca ratios in authigenic carbonate or ostracodes would be more difficult to interpret. In general, the Mg/Ca ratio decreases with increasing salinity. The dynamics of Ca- and Mg-bearing mineral phases need to be considered for a detailed interpretation of the Mg/Ca ratios in these lakes.																			0921-2728					JAN	1997	17	1					33	49		10.1023/A:1007908909148	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1007908909148													WOS:A1997WK96500005
J	Yemane, K; Kahr, G; Kelts, K				Yemane, K; Kahr, G; Kelts, K			Imprints of post-glacial climates and palaeogeography in the detrital clay mineral assemblages of an Upper Permian fluviolacustrine Gondwana deposit from northern Malawi	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Detailed quantitative clay mineral studies on an Upper Permian fluviolacustrine Gondwana deposit (approximate to 55 degrees S) from northern Malawi (9 degrees S, 32 degrees E) in central-southern Africa show imprints of Late Permian climates on the clay mineral assemblages. The clay mineral assemblage in the bottom 75 m is characterised by abundant illite, chlorite, regular smectite-chlorite (corrensite), regular illite-smectite, and vermiculite (Zone I). Between 75-240 m, illite and chlorite are the principal clay minerals, whereas corrensite and irregular illite-smectite mixed-layers disappear and vermiculite is rarely present (Zone II). The assemblage between 240-305 m is similar to that in Zone I, but is distinguished by the absence of irregular illite-smectite and a decrease in corrensite (Zone III). Kerogen fluorescence and chemistry, vitrinite reflectance, and palynomorph thermal alteration index indicate insignificant thermal diagenesis (50-70 degrees C). The absence of depth-temperature related variation in mixed-layer mineral composition or in illite crystallinity indicate that the original clay mineral composition has not been overprinted by diagenetic modifications. Sandstone provenance and palaeocurrent directions suggest that detritus throughout deposition was derived from the slowly uplifting Nyika Plateau Basement and sedimentary rocks southwest and west of the basin. Furthermore, compositional and textural immaturity of the sandstones, as well as the fresh nature of the feldspars strongly suggest that the detritus was little-altered. The clay mineral assemblages in the three zones can thus be interpreted as representing the signatures of the climate during the periods of deposition. Zones I and III represent warmer and more seasonal climates than Zone II, which had generally more humid but less distinct seasons. Sedimentological features such as the presence of nonglacial rhythmites, sub-millimetric to millimetric laminated mudrocks, elevated CaCO3 and TOC contents in claystones and mudstones in Zones I and III, whereas organic-lean, coarse siltstones and sandstones are common in Zone II. The three assemblage zones reflect changes perhaps associated with global Late Permian climate cycles. The quantitative clay mineral composition of the Upper Permian deposit is similar to those from modern temperate lake sediments from equivalent geographic and latitudinal settings, and source rocks in the drainage basins, in the northern hemisphere. The Upper Permian clay mineral assemblage contains substantial quantities of corrensite, which to date is documented from hypersaline or metamorphosed sedimentary environments. We report here its first occurrence from a shallow-buried freshwater lacustrine deposit and present evidence for syngenetic aggradation of detrital mixed-layers in a magnesium-enriched lacustrine depositional environment.																			0031-0182					OCT	1996	125	1-4					27	49		10.1016/S0031-0182(96)00023-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0031-0182(96)00023-5													WOS:A1996VZ39900003
J	NAGATA, T				NAGATA, T			THE MICROFLAGELLATE-PICOPLANKTON FOOD LINKAGE IN THE WATER COLUMN OF LAKE BIWA	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Seasonal variations of abundance and biomass of heterotrophic microflagellates (HMF), bacteria, and unicellular chroococcoid cyanobacteria (UCB) at a pelagic site (water depth, .apprx.72 m) in the north basin of Lake Biwa were measured during May to November 1984. The cell densities of HMF, bacteria, and UCB were 102-103, 106, and 102-105 cells ml-1, and the biomass estimates were <1-7, 10-70, and <1-20 .mu.g C liter-1. Active phagocytosis of UCB by HMF was indicated from microscopic observation of HMF food vacuoles; when UCB density was high, up to 52% of HMF cells contained one or more UCB cells. Incubation of size-fractionated epilimnetic waters indicated that bacterial net production rates (5-25 .mu.g C liter-1d-1) were usually almost equal to rates of consumption of bacteria by HMF populations. Esimates of gross growth efficiencies of HMF fed on natural picoplankton were 11-53% in terms of carbon. HMF may be a significant link transfering picoplankton energy to macrozooplankters which cannot collect picoplankton. Lack of information on the fate of HMF makes it difficult, however, to directly address the "sink vs. link" argument about the microbial loop in Lake Biwa.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	1988	33	4	1				504	517		10.4319/lo.1988.33.4.0504	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1988.33.4.0504													WOS:A1988P891900002

The length data for estimation was categorized into 13 bins, and population parameters were explored utilizing various options in ELEFAN I, with the best fit (Rn = 0.282) calculated by means of the FiSAT-II application. TW = 1.94 TL2.94, with a = - 1.94, b = 2.94, and an attuned r2 = 0.77 were derived for the weight and length association. The growing performance metric (phi) was calculated as 2.80. S. niger harvested stock in Manasbal Lake was prevalent in length categories of 20.5 to 25.4 and 25.5 to 30.4 cm. Different growth attributes were valued utilizing length frequency statistics as L infinity = 46.05 cm, k = 0.30/year, and t0 = - 0.493 years. Over all mortality (Z), natural mortality (M), and fishing mortality (F) coefficients were evaluated as 1.43 year-1, 0.56 year-1, and 0.87 year-1, respectively. The fish's average length was assessed at the culmination of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th year as 15.42 cm, 22.78 cm, 28.09 cm, 32.61 cm, 36.03 cm, and 38.53 cm, respectively. Recruitment patterns in S. niger from Manasbal Lake indicate a singular annual recruitment occurrence, exclusively observed during the month of June. The current value of the exploitation (fish harvest) ratio (E) was 0.61 by the size-transformed catch curvature method, found to be marginally lower than the maximum value (Emax) of 0.699 depicting that the species is on the brink of overexploitation, and caution is required to maintain sustainability. The seasonal analysis of water quality parameters revealed that except for pH and free carbon dioxide, the other parameters showed pronounced temporal variations. Total alkalinity values were reflective of hard water type of the lake, and dissolved oxygen and free carbon dioxide values were reported to be suitable for S. niger.

One of the major problems hampering the derivation of meaningful texture information from SAR imagery is the speckle noise. It overlays real structures and causes gray value variations even in homogeneous parts of the image. We propose a filtering technique which can be applied to obtain restored SAR images. Our technique is based on probabilistic methods and regards an image as a random element drawn from a prespecified set of possible images. The despeckle filter can be used as an intermediate step for the extraction of regions of interest, corresponding to structured units in a given area or distinct objects of interest, such as lake-like features on Titan. This tool can therefore be used, among other, to study seasonal surficial changes of Titan's polar regions. In this study we also present a segmentation technique that allows us to separate the lakes from the local background. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Consistent, long-term change in rotifer community composition across four Polish lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Few studies exist documenting changes in rotifer communities over long time intervals. Here, we explore seasonal and long-term variation in rotifer communities in four Polish lakes sampled in 1976 and again in 1997. Rarefied, asymptotic species richness did not differ significantly across study years, although values in 1997 tended to be higher. Simpson's and Shannon-Wiener diversity measures provided inconsistent temporal results, with only the former indicating significantly higher richness in 1997. Sorensen's coefficient of community similarity was as high among lakes in 1976 (0.81) and in 1997 (0.76) as within lakes across the 21-year span (0.77). Nonlinear redundancy analysis of species' abundances revealed large, consistent seasonal changes across lakes, smaller consistent shifts between sampling periods, and small differences between lakes. Collectively, these metrics indicate that species composition was relatively stable among lakes within years and within lakes between years, while species' abundance patterns were far more variable and most affected by season.					; macisaac, hugh/AAE-3742-2020	Muirhead, Jim/0000-0002-0264-3662; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2009	624	1					107	114		10.1007/s10750-008-9671-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9671-y													WOS:000263378100009

Addressing these issues requires a better understanding of the complex sources of nitrogen, which include fertilizers, groundwater, manure, and sewage. In this study, we analyzed the nitrogen isotopic composition of dissolved nitrate and particulate nitrogen from the Wax Lake Delta, a major distributary of the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River Basin that flows into the Gulf of Mexico. Our findings revealed that during the wet season, delta 15N values of both nitrate and particulate nitrogen were consistently 2-3 parts per thousand lower compared to the dry season. This suggests that fertilizer-derived nitrogen, which has lower delta 15N, is predominantly exported to the Gulf of Mexico during periods of high water discharge. These findings imply that adjusting fertilizer application timing could help reduce nitrogen loading and mitigate its environmental impact on the Gulf of Mexico.					陳, 建志/JCE-8602-2023; Wang, Xingchen/C-7213-2012; Tian, Hanqin/A-6484-2012	Wang, Xingchen (Tony)/0000-0001-5316-789X; Tian, Hanqin/0000-0002-1806-4091; Donnelly, Heather/0000-0001-7838-5009														2662-4435				DEC 10	2024	5	1							745	10.1038/s43247-024-01873-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s43247-024-01873-y													WOS:001374157900002

Microscopic observations revealed the existence of straight or slightly curved filaments. Filament ends exhibited various shapes: rounded (39%), intermediate (40%), pencil (16%), and needle (5%). However, only rounded filament ends were present throughout this cycle. Four morphotypes were observed: filaments with heterocytes and akinetes (< 1%), akinetes only (< 2%), heterocytes only (6%), and neither heterocytes nor akinetes (> 90%). Results showed that filaments without heterocytes or akinetes, and those with only heterocytes, positively correlated with nitrates, conductivity, turbidity, atmopspheric temperature, water temperature, and pH, but negatively with transparency and dissolved oxygen. Conversely, filaments with heterocytes and akinetes were positively correlated with precipitation (Preci) (p <= 0.001), showing a positive correlation with phosphates while filaments with only akinetes displayed negative correlations with WT and Trans. Only extracellular Cylindrospermopsin was detected during the study period, excluding February and April, with concentrations ranging from 80 to 750 ng/. Four CYN peaks exceeding 500 ng/L were offset from C. raciborskii biomass peaks. The observed morphological variability in filaments sampled from Lake Oubeira confirms the species as C. raciborskii. However, employing additional approaches, such as culturing, and molecular taxonomy, would be necessary to complete the study of this cyanobacteria species.																			1386-2588	1573-5125				MAR	2025	59	1					247	262		10.1007/s10452-024-10160-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-024-10160-z		DEC 2024											WOS:001375807200001

Impacts are intensified during heavy storm events that strip unprotected topsoils and pose risks to downstream water ecosystems. To better understand such dynamics, we investigated an agricultural mountainous catchment located on the Democratic Republic of the Congo shore of Lake Kivu. This area is characterised by weak governance systems exacerbated by protracted violent conflicts, which have prevented the application of remediation practices to address extensive land use changes, including deforestation and monoculture proliferation, notably banana plantations. Additionally, the spread of Banana Xanthomonas wilt (BXW) has further augmented land use impacts. Herein the complete diseased mat uprooting (CDMU) method employed to combat the disease has resulted in significant erosion and sediment export rates. Following the recovery of banana plantations from CDMU, sediment export rates continued to increase without a clear responsible party but more as a legacy of past and present land degradation activities and embedded soil erosion and connectivity process pathways. To analyse the impact of high-intensity storm events coupled with the aftermath of conflict instability and the effects of BXW on erosion dynamics, the sediment fingerprinting technique was implemented. We collected 60 sediment source samples across a 42 km2 catchment, predominantly cultivated since the mid-20th century. Samples spanned four main land uses/land covers: seasonal crops, banana plantations, bare or degraded soil, and channel banks. Additionally, mixture/target samples were collected at the summit of six fluvial terraces located at different altitudes along the vertical profile of the river after a high-intensity storm event. These terraces serve as natural indicators of sediment accumulation under different flow intensities, with higher terraces representing sediment deposition during higher discharge. Furthermore, sediment samples were collected via a gravity core in delta deposits at the river's inflow into the lake, allowing us to identify the main sources contributing to fine sediment export to the lake. This methodology enabled us to assess how sediment provenance has changed in response to varying discharge levels while elucidating the primary sources responsible for fine sediment inputs to the lake and the subsequent water quality decrease. Our analysis indicates increased contributions occurred from channel banks and degraded areas as discharge increased. Despite steep channel banks and degraded soils being primary sediment sources on the terraces, agricultural and banana sources predominantly contributed to the fine sediments exported to the lake. These findings underscore the hazards of high-intensity storm events in these fragile ecosystems and highlight the role of current banana plantation and cropland management in degrading land and water quality. Understanding the primary factors driving land degradation and sediment export is crucial for preventing further ecosystem degradation and mitigating heightened instability in conflict-affected areas. This research suggests that remediation practices should be incentivised to create buffer structures in upslope agricultural areas and protect the fertile sediments from banana plantations from being exported to the lake if socio-cultural and economic hurdles to implementation can be overcome.

Ecology of eyetail bowfin (Amia ocellicauda) in Green Bay, Lake Michigan	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Eyetail bowfin (Amia ocellicauda) ecology in the Great Lakes is poorly understood, despite their role as a predator in one of the most economically important fisheries in the USA. Here, we investigate eyetail bowfin ecology in Green Bay, Lake Michigan, which is a stochastic ecosystem with latitudinal and longitudinal hydrogeomorphic and environmental gradients. Migratory activity was characterized over 6 years (2014-2019) in a seasonally flooded inland wetland connected to Green Bay. Moderate rates of interannual return were documented in tagged fish, and migration movements were positively associated with wetland water temperature. Eyetail bowfin were also collected from seven coastal wetland sites within Green Bay in 2014 and 2015 to assess age, growth, mortality, and trophic niche space. Eyetail bowfin age estimates ranged from 0 to 19 years, and growth and mortality estimates are similar to reported rates in other Midwest systems. Between reader precision of age estimation from two hard structures was high (asteriscii mean coefficient of variation [CV] = 7.88%; sagittae CV = 7.00%), and estimates from the two structures were similar (CV = 13.22%). Stable isotope analysis indicated a large and flexible trophic niche, with fish undergoing an ontogenetic diet shift in their first year to adults. Our description of eyetail bowfin natural history in Green Bay supports the historic characterization as a flexible, generalist predator capable of using diverse wetland habitats and resources.

In the Lake Melville estuary (Labrador, Canada), at the northern limit of its distribution range, smelt represents the main forage species and faces environmental changes from both climate warming and hydroelectric dams. This study aims to improve our understanding of the ecology of rainbow smelt and its vulnerability to climate and anthropogenic changes. We investigated hatching period, growth, and maturation of rainbow smelt in the Lake Melville estuary using trawl surveys and otolithometry. Growth and maturity from rainbow smelt in Lake Melville were then compared to southern populations to test the temperature-size rule, which stipulates slower growth and larger length-at-age of maturity at colder temperatures. In accordance with this rule, adult rainbow smelt in Lake Melville grew slower, matured up to 2 years later, and lived up to 3 years longer compared to southern populations. In contrast to it, larval growth rate was up to 3 times faster than values reported for a more southern population. Our results demonstrate that rainbow smelt in Lake Melville are well adapted to the short growth season and cold water temperatures prevailing at sub-arctic latitudes. Yet, if variation in life history across their range is a plastic response to thermal gradients, populations at their northern limits could benefit from a longer and warmer growth season.

J	SPRUNG, M				SPRUNG, M			FIELD AND LABORATORY OBSERVATIONS OF DREISSENA-POLYMORPHA LARVAE - ABUNDANCE, GROWTH, MORTALITY AND FOOD DEMANDS	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The abundance of Dreissena polymorpha larvae has been recorded from 2 lakes at 2 to 3 day intervals during the spawning seasons of 2 and 3 years respectively. Growth of the larvae could be calculated from distinct cohorts. Resident time in the plankton could be extrapolated from the growth curves for distinct temperatures; on three occasions it could be determined directly as 18, 28 and 33 days. Mortality during the planktonic stage could be estimated as being 60 to 89 per cent from the trochophore to the D-stage and 99.3 to 100 per cent from the D-stage to settling size in different years. Cage experiments showed that mortality is not only due to predation. Eggs had a mean ash free dry weight of 34.4 ng and an average lipid content of 29.6 per cent. Despite the high degree of variation found in the lipid analysis (9.8 to 78.8 per cent lipid), there was no evidence for reduced rearing success as a consequence of reduced lipid content were not significant. Dreissena larvae can only feed on particles greater than 1 .mu.m but smaller than 4 .mu.m in diameter. The particle concentration of this size fraction has been described for both lakes over one spawning period. There was no correlation between growth rate and particle concentration. Fifty strains of laboratory cultivated potential food particles (algae, blue-green algae, bacteria, yeast), which were tested, did not provide an adequate food source of the larvae. Larvae in the plankton can survive for 1 to 2 weeks without food and remain active most of the time.																			0003-9136					JUN	1989	115	4					537	561																WOS:A1989AF76900004

Variation in resource use and potential competition for Walleye across seasons and habitats	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												ObjectiveWe quantified seasonal changes in resource overlap among Walleye Sander vitreus, Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu, and Northern Pike Esox lucius in a glacial lake (Lake Kampeska, South Dakota) to evaluate potential competition. To determine whether habitat use might contribute to potential reduced competition for Walleye, we also compared resource use of Walleye in the lake to that of Walleye in a connected wetland.MethodsWe sampled our target species by using electrofishing and gill netting. We identified stomach contents to examine diet similarities, and we used Layman metrics and Bayesian ellipses to compare isotopic resource niches.ResultWalleye had the greatest resource overlap with Smallmouth Bass, but overlap varied as diets changed seasonally. Multiple species exploited Yellow Perch Perca flavescens and White Bass Morone chrysops as prey, but only Walleye consumed bullheads Ameiurus spp. Walleye from the wetland had a distinct isotopic signature and broader isotopic niche, indicating a wetland resource signature.ConclusionHabitat diversity and connectivity in freshwater systems can limit the potential for intra- and interspecific competition while also increasing resilience to environmental change.

By combining data from multiple satellite missions, the European Space Agency's Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) aims to deliver stable, long-term, satellite data products suitable for trend assessments. Here we demonstrate the value of OC-CCI products for reporting on water clarity status and long-term trends in North America's largest lakes. Extensive matchups between the OC-CCI Kd at 490 nm (Kd490) and in situ Z SD observations spanning 25 years enabled robust multi-lake validation of Z SD retrievals over a wide range of water clarity conditions (R2 = 0.9, MAPE = 29.6 %, BIAS = 6.6 %, N = 4297) providing a transferable model for large-scale mapping of inland water clarity. Significant differences in Z SD retrieval uncertainty were observed between years, missions, and specific periods marking changes in the sensor datasets contributing to the OC-CCI products. Bias-correction of the OC-CCI Kd 490 provided confidence in the assumption of seamless continuity in this multi-mission dataset, thereby allowing long-term time-series analyses. Seasonal, inter-annual and inter-decadal variability and trends in lake-wide average Z SD were subsequently evaluated for nine large lakes across Canada and the U.S. over the 1998-2023 period, capturing the timing and magnitude of significant shifts in water clarity conditions. Observations agree well with documented periods of ecosystem change in response to the cumulative impacts from harmful algal blooms, nutrient status, invasive species, and hydrological events.

Depositional history of the Holocene Faiyum Paleolake (Egypt) inferred from a petrographic analysis	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The Faiyum Depression basin was fed by the Nile River during high-flow seasons in the Holocene. A large freshwater lake persisted in the basin during most of the Holocene. The geological setting and geomorphological characteristics of this basin has made it a topic in North African hydrology, climate, and environment, especially in Egypt. The ancient shore sediments today are fragmentary, discontinuous, and suffer from extensive erosion but substantial records of the ancient lake remain. Continuous sediment records from drill cores provided a near complete record of the Holocene history of Faiyum Lake. The recovered sedimentary sequence of one core F3-08 consists of predominantly siliciclastic lacustrine facies divisible into six informal units. Petrographic analysis provides high resolution evidence of major hydrological changes affecting the lake system. In the early-middle Holocene this lake persisted but with a lower water level and thicker sediment layers. The middle Holocene Lake experienced repetitive variations in lake level as the amount of Nile water entering the depression fluctuated. During the late Holocene, the lake level dramatically lowered in part due to the construction of earthen dams during the late Holocene and to changes in the Nile headwaters.

In view of its elimination as a public health problem by 2030, adopting a One Health approach is necessary, considering its multidimensional nature. Animal reservoirs, in particular, pose a significant threat to schistosomiasis control in Africa and beyond. In this study, we conducted a spatio-temporal survey of Schistosoma infections in small mammal communities and intermediate snail hosts in the vicinity of Lake Guiers in northern Senegal. Sampling campaigns were undertaken four times between April 2021 and August 2022 around eight villages. A total of 534 small mammals of four species, primarily Hubert's multimammate mice Mastomys huberti, were captured. Out of 498 individuals examined, only 18 rodents (17 M. huberti and 1 Arvicanthis niloticus) were infected with schistosomes. The infection rates in M. huberti varied over time (prevalence range: 2.4% to 9.3%, intensity range: 4 to 132), and space (prevalence range: 3.1% to 40%, intensity range: 2 to 110) and were higher in adult hosts captured during or just after the rainy season, a time when older individuals dominate in rodent populations. Using a multi-locus molecular approach (cox1 and ITS) on Schistosoma larvae (cercariae and miracidia) and adult worms, we identified Schistosoma mansoni as the most widespread species. We also detected Schistosoma bovis and Schistosoma haematobium in M. huberti from one locality (Temeye). Although no Schistosoma hybrids were found, the discovery of a male S. mansoni and a female S. bovis pair raises concerns about potential hybridization patterns that could occur in rodents. Finally, three snail species were found infected (25 Biomphalaria pfeifferi, 3 Bulinus truncatus and 1 Bulinus senegalensis) including with S. mansoni, S. bovis, S. haematobium and S. haematobium x S. bovis hybrids. Our findings highlight the spatial-temporal variations of Schistosoma infections in rodents and emphasize the need for fine-scale monitoring over time and space for effective One Health measures and ensuring the sustainability of schistosomiasis control efforts.

The Ushkan'i Islands, Lake Baikal, and Their Role and Significance in the Life of the Baikal Seal (Pusa sibirica Gmelin 1788, Pinnipedia) under Modern Conditions	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												For the first time, a detailed description of the coastline of the Ushkan'i Islands, Lake Baikal, is given in order to assess the use of the shore by the Baikal seal (Pusa sibirica Gm.) as haulouts and the role these haulouts play in the annual cycle of seals. To do this, video recordings obtained using the DJI UAV Mavic 2 Zoom (take-off weight 905 g) and Air 2 S (take-off weight 595 g), as well as long-term field observations, were used. A complete survey of the coastline of all four islands was carried out on May 29th and 30th, 2022 (at a water level of 456.40 m a.s.l.), and on August 12th and 24th (water level 456.79 and 456.83 m, respectively). Based on the lithological characteristics, about 30% of the coastline on Bolshoi Ushkanii Island, the largest one, is shown to be suitable for use by seals, but currently this is not the case. Among the three smaller islands, the favorite place for the formation of seal haulouts is Kruglyi Island, based on the total number of animals recorded on the island and in coastal waters, followed by the Tonkii Island and then Dolgii Island, the latter supporting a stationary video system transmitting information online. On all islands, the coordinates of specific haulout/rookery locations have been determined. Currently, about 35% of the length of the coastline of the three smaller Ushkan'i Islands are being used by seals for haulouts to one degree or another. Under current climatic conditions, the haulouts on the smaller Ushkan'i Islands seem to play extremely important roles for a significant part of the population (several thousand individuals visit them every season), since most other rookeries and locations that seals could use as such are highly susceptible to anthropogenic impacts.																			1062-3590	1608-3059				DEC	2024	51	8					2596	2612		10.1134/S1062359024701164	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1062359024701164													WOS:001399013300003

Positive allometric growth was estimated for 418 P. parva collected in 2023 (TW = 0.0065xTL3.305; TW = 0.003 x SL 3.3946 ), while a negative allometric growth pattern was established for 764 P. parva collected in 2024 (TW = 0.0122xTL2.7309; TW = 0.0252 x SL 2.5731 ). The values for condition factor K ranged between 0.47 and 0.74 (2023) and 0.31 and 1.47 (2024). For all individuals included in this study, the values for slope b were within the expected range of 2.5-3.5. In 2023, with b greater than 3, the growth type was estimated as positive allometric, while in 2024, the b lower than 3 indicated a hypoallometric growth type. On the other hand, in April 2024, a questionnaire was created in order to investigate the human knowledge about the traits of stone moroko in Romania. The surveyed fishermen appreciated both the initiative to address the impact of this invasive fish species and the integration of educational information in the questionnaire. Analysing the received answers, it was confirmed that people are aware about the necessary to apply methods in order to limit the reproduction of the stone moroko in Romania.

Longitudinal and Seasonal Changes of Organic Matter Sources Through a Semi-Arid River-Reservoir System	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The quality and quantity of organic matter (OM) in a river system directly affects ecosystem health; thus, managers benefit from an in-depth understanding of the drivers and sources of OM. In the Snake River, a highly altered river-reservoir system in the semi-arid western United States, OM production and loading are key drivers of reservoir anoxia, which leads to several deleterious processes such as mercury methylation. However, sources and quantities of OM to the Snake River, and the effects of impoundment on OM moving through the river-reservoir system, are not well understood. Particulate organic carbon (POC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), particulate nitrogen (PN), chlorophyll a (chl-a), and delta 15N-PN and delta 13C-POC isotopic ratios were measured bi-weekly for over 2 years at four locations through the Snake River Hells Canyon Reservoir Complex to determine spatial and temporal patterns of OM quantities and sources. POC concentrations increased through the riverine zone upstream of the reservoirs, likely due to in situ primary production and/or inputs from tributaries and agricultural drains; then decreased through the most upstream reservoir likely due to particle settling. Isotopic ratios and other OM source indicators (delta 15N-PN, delta 13C-POC, POC:PN, chl-a:POC) show that the dominant source of particulate OM was phytoplankton with seasonal terrestrial/macrophytic inputs. Results highlight the effects of major tributary and agricultural drain inputs, primary production, and impoundment on OM composition and concentration through a large river-reservoir system and may inform water quality management efforts in this and similar systems.					; Poulin, Brett/LTE-5938-2024	Yoder, Alysa/0000-0002-3683-6729; Krabbenhoft, David/0000-0003-1964-5020; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				DEC	2024	129	12							e2024JG008242	10.1029/2024JG008242	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024JG008242													WOS:001369945100001

However, research regarding the mechanisms driving temperature fluctuations in thermokarst lakes and the factors that influence these changes is limited. We aimed to analyze seasonal variations in the surface water temperature, clarify historical trends in the phenological characteristics of lake ice, and predict future temperature changes in surface water of the thermokarst lakes using the air2water model. The results indicated that in comparison with air temperature, the thermokarst lake's surface water temperature showed a certain lag and significantly higher values in the warm season. The warming rate of the thermokarst lake's average surface water temperature based on historical data from 1957 to 2022 was 0.21 degrees C per decade, with a notably higher rate in August (0.42 degrees C per decade) than in other months. Furthermore, the ice-covered period steadily decreased by 2.12 d per decade. Based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 projections, by 2100, the surface water temperatures of thermokarst lakes during the warm season are projected to increase by 0.38, 0.46, and 2.82 degrees C (under scenarios SSP126, SSP245, and SSP585), respectively. Compared with typical tectonic lakes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, thermokarst lakes have higher average surface water temperatures during ice-free periods, and they exhibit a higher warming rate (0.21 degrees C per decade). These results elucidate the response mechanisms of thermokarst lakes' surface water temperature and the phenological characteristics of lake ice in response to climate change.																				2072-4292				DEC	2024	16	24							4645	10.3390/rs16244645	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16244645													WOS:001384558500001

Indeed, water is increasingly affected by minerals and organic matters and even by the micro-organisms of which some are pathogenic and thus dangerous for the ecosystem. In this context, the present study was conducted to investigate the microbiological pollution of water of the lake Mellah, located in the national park of El Kala, North-eastern Algerian. This lake is a depression which communicates with the sea and flowing the domestic effluents of the neighbouring localities. The physicochemical parameters (Temperature, pH; Eh; Electric conductivity; Salinity, Turbidity, and O-2) and bacteriological (coliformes total, coliformes thermo tolerant, streptococci) were followed during the year 2011 with a seasonal frequency (February, May, August, November). Seventeen (17) sites of three different habitats were investigated; the waste-water treatment plant (WWTP), Wadis and their upstream to the estuary and the lake. The follow-up of analysis of the physicochemical and biological parameters in the various points of observation was the object of a graphs data processing and statistics (ACP) to determine the bacteriological degree of pollution. Results showed a contamination by the fecal matter with a gradient decreasing from the upstream of the discharge system towards the downstream. Compared to rain waters, microbiological pollution in the lake was selective in time. The CT and the CTT decreased in dry season where the ambient conditions (salinity, pH and temperature) become unfavorable, putting the factor salinity concerned to degrade the water pollution.					kherifi, Wahida/ABC-3466-2021														0097-8078	1608-344X				MAY	2016	43	3					546	558		10.1134/S0097807816030180	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0097807816030180													WOS:000384141600014

Carr.] and northern hardwood forests dominated by sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.). In this study, we survey the relative effects of management practice (old growth vs. managed), forest cover type (hemlock vs. northern hardwood), and soil great group (Entic Haplorthod vs. Alfic Oxyaquic Fragiorthod) on ion cycling as a precursor to a longer-term, more detailed study. Bulk precipitation, throughfall, and soil leachates at three depths were collected for two growing seasons in eight stands on the Ottawa National Forest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. A total of 1210 solutions were analyzed for pH, Na, K, Mg, Ca, Cl, NO3, and SO4. Losses of base cations (Ca, Mg, K) and SO4 from the bottom of the rooting zone generally were greater in old-growth than in managed northern hardwoods on both fragic and nonfragic soils. Leaching losses of base cations and NO3 usually were greater beneath old-growth northern hardwoods than beneath old-growth hemlock on both soil types and for both forest cover types and management practices on fragic than nonfragic soils. Management practice, forest cover type, and soil type all appear to affect ion cycling within these forests. All of the stands featured striking losses of base cations that probably are influenced strongly by NO3 and SO4 in atmospheric deposition.																			0047-2425					SEP-OCT	2002	31	5					1623	1629		10.2134/jeq2002.1623	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2002.1623								12371179					WOS:000178156800023

J	Lamontagne, S; Schiff, SL				Lamontagne, S; Schiff, SL			The response of a heterogeneous upland boreal shield catchment to a short term NO3- addition	ECOSYSTEMS												Boreal Shield rocky ridges at the Experimental Lakes Area, northwestern Ontario, contain two plant/soil communities with contrasting N cycles. Picea mariana-Pinus banksiana "forest islands" are N limited whereas the lichen, moss, and grass community (or "lichen patches") on the surrounding bedrock outcrops appear intrinsically N saturated. The potential for this landscape to retain a N input of eightfold ambient levels was tested with a 2-y addition of 40 kpa N ha(-1) y(-1) as NaNO(3) to one small catchment (0.40 ha). The elevated N input was poorly retained by the whole catchment during snowmelt. However, during the growing season, N retention in the treated catchment remained as efficient as in references. Forest islands and bedrock surfaces responded in opposite fashions to the elevated N input. By the second year of N addition, bedrock surfaces no longer retained additional N inputs. In contrast, N-amended and reference forest islands retained a similar proportion of N inputs, indicating that forest islands did not become N saturated. The response of the whole catchment to N addition was more similar to forest islands than bedrock surfaces. Even if forest islands only cover a small proportion of catchment area, they can have a strong impact on whole catchment element export because most of the water must move through at least one island before leaving the system. Because the different components of the boreal shield landscape are hydrologically connected, N saturation may occur as a cascading effect in this ecosystem. Monitoring boreal shield landscapes by using outlets at the lower end of the hydrological cascade can fail to detect the impacts of perturbations such as increased N deposition on upper components.

J	STOTTLEMYER, R; TROENDLE, CA				STOTTLEMYER, R; TROENDLE, CA			NUTRIENT CONCENTRATION PATTERNS IN STREAMS DRAINING ALPINE AND SUB-ALPINE CATCHMENTS, FRASER EXPERIMENTAL FOREST, COLORADO	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Streamwater samples were collected during 1987-1988 from two adjacent gauged watersheds, the subalpine-alpine East St. Lows and the Fool Creek Alpine, in the Fraser Experimental Forest, Colorado. The study objective was to compare the relationships between streamwater discharge and ion concentration in alpine and alpine-subalpine watersheds at a site receiving low inputs of atmospheric contaminants. Streamwater discharge accounts for much of the variation in ion concentration. Trajectories of time, discharge, and ion concentration suggest that patterns of nutrient flux are controlled primarily by the magnitude of streamwater discharge, and seasonal differences in the relative contributions of snowmelt and soil water. In the subalpine catchment, increased streamwater discharge accounted for most of the decline in concentration of ions, with high concentrations in soil water relative to precipitation. This relationship was not seen in the alpine catchment, probably because of the influence of large diurnal variation in the ratio of snowmelt to soil water. In both catchments, ions with comparatively high concentrations in precipitation and the snowpack relative to soil water showed less concentration decline with increased streamwater discharge. The recurring nature of the trajectories, especially in the subalpine catchment, suggests that the time, discharge, and ion concentration patterns may represent a general characteristic in moderate-sized, undisturbed Rocky Mountain catchments which do not receive high inputs of airborne contaminants.																			0022-1694					DEC	1992	140	1-4					179	208		10.1016/0022-1694(92)90240-V	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(92)90240-V													WOS:A1992KJ52800009

The common tern Sterna hirundo is a long-distance migratory seabird that is considered a species of conservation concern in the North American Great Lakes region and that has experienced significant declines in breeding numbers across large lakes in Manitoba. To better understand the movement ecology of common terns, we used data from multiple tracking technologies (solar geolocation, GPS tracking, and Motus radio tracking) obtained from individuals (n=83) across five breeding colonies on four inland lakes in North America. We identified key stopover regions used during southward migration and explored how demographics and social interactions influence connectivity. We identified three key stopover regions (Lake Erie, the southern Atlantic Coast, and Florida) and documented, for the first time, differences in post-natal and post-breeding migration for inland nesting terns. Juveniles arrived, on average, three weeks later than unrelated adults to their first major staging area. Although adult female arrival to and departure from Lake Erie was similar to adult males, female schedules became significantly earlier than males as southward migration progressed. Using a graph network to describe the spatiotemporal associations among adults from the same inland lake, individuals appeared to be highly connected, meeting up in different regions throughout the non-breeding season, suggesting that social interactions may play an important role in maintaining spatial connectivity. Despite differences in migration schedules by sex and arrival to the first major staging area by age class, birds appeared to rely on the same key stopover regions during southward migration. The stopover regions identified in this study can help identify potential bottlenecks and guide future research aimed at assessing the impacts of climate change and human disturbance on common terns breeding in North America.

J	PILSKALN, CH; JOHNSON, TC				PILSKALN, CH; JOHNSON, TC			SEASONAL SIGNALS IN LAKE MALAWI SEDIMENTS	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The sedimentary record of Lake Malawi, one of the large rift valley lakes of east Africa, contains thick sequences of biologically undisturbed, finely laminated muds and silts. Laminated sequences were recovered in cores from the extensive diatom ooze and silty diatom clay facies of the lake basin that is permanently anoxic below 250 m. The sequences consist of light-dark laminae couplets with average thickness of 1 mm. The light laminae are completely dominated by the diatom genus Melosira with a relatively minor contribution from the genus Stephanodiscus. The dark laminae consists of 50% diatoms (equal proportions of Melosira and Stephanodiscus, few Nitzschia, and occasional littoral diatom genera) and 50% terrestrial plant debris, mineral grains, and fine clay and organic material. Based on a Pb-210 and C-14 calculated sedimentation rate of 1 mm yr-1 for Lake Malawi basin sediments and the well-defined seasonal variations in fluvial input and diatom productivity levels, our data suggest that the lamination couplets are annual varves, representing biannual sedimentation sequences. The light laminae result from diatom blooms occurring during the dry, windy season (April-October) when the upper 250 m of the lake is well-mixed, localized upwelling occurs, and the epilimnion becomes enriched with nutrients. The dark laminae represent sedimentation in the rainy, low-wind velocity season (November-March) when runoff and allochthonous terrestrial input are at a maximum and primary productivity is at a minimum.

J	GOPAL, B; SAH, M				GOPAL, B; SAH, M			INVENTORY AND CLASSIFICATION OF WETLANDS IN INDIA	VEGETATIO					IV International Wetlands Conference on Wetlands - Old World and New World	1992	COLUMBUS, OH					The Indian subcontinent has a large variety of freshwater, saline and marine wetlands. Whereas the mangroves are relatively well documented, very little is known about the other wetlands, with few exceptions. Only recently an inventory of these welands has been prepared but no effort has been made to classify them. A vast majority of the inland wetlands are temporary and/or man-made, and they have been traditionally used and managed by the local human populations. In this paper, first, we evaluate the classification schemes of the IUCN, US Fish and Wildlife Services and those of the Australian wetlands, for their applicability to Indian wetlands. Then, we propose a simple hierarchical classification of wetlands based on their location (coastal or inland), salinity (saline or freshwater), physiognomy (herbaceous or woody), duration of flooding (permanent or seasonal) and the growth forms of the dominant vegetation. We stress upon the hydrological factors which determine all the structural and functional characteristics of the wetlands. We consider that the various growth forms of wetland vegetation integrate the totality of hydrological variables and therefore, can be used as the indicators of different hydrological regimes.																			0042-3106					JUN	1995	118	1-2					39	48		10.1007/BF00045189	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00045189													WOS:A1995RW03600005
J	Wang, XM; Guo, YF				Wang, Xiaomei; Guo, Yufei			Spatio-temporal analysis of water area variability in Poyang Lake (2012-2021) using remote sensing	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL METHODS IN SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING												With global warming and aggravation due to human activities, many regions of the world have suffered from frequent droughts and floods in recent decades. As the largest freshwater lake in China, and one of the ten ecological function reserves in China, Poyang Lake plays an important role in the local ecological environment. It is necessary to use long-term frequent satellite observations to investigate the Poyang Lake due to the significant seasonality of the lake's area. This paper selects 20 periods of Landsat remote sensing images during the wet and dry seasons over 10 years from 2012 to 2021 as the data source. Threshold method is a commonly used method for water extraction, and different threshold methods have their advantages and disadvantages. Five water extraction methods were used: single-band threshold method, multi-band spectral relationship method, Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified NDWI (MNDWI), and Modified Automatic Water Extraction Index (MAWEI), to extract water bodies from the Landsat 5 images dated February 15, 2004. The water area extracted by MAWEI had the smallest deviation from the actual measured area. It had the highest overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient. Additionally, it exhibited fewer instances of false positives and false negatives, and performed well in extracting small water bodies. Using the MAWEI method to perform water body extraction for Poyang Lake during the wet and dry seasons from 2012 to 2021 demonstrated significant interannual variability in the lake's area, with a pronounced seasonal fluctuation. A comparison of the lake area between the first and last 5 years of this period revealed a shrinking trend in the lake's extent. Moreover, the dynamic change in the lake area during the wet seasons was found to be less than that during the dry seasons, with an average dynamic change of 14.1% for the wet season and 16.4% for the dry season. Influenced by the floods in 2020, the water area reached its maximum. The driving factors behind the changes in the area of Poyang Lake were analyzed in conjunction with meteorological data. By calculating the Pearson coefficient, it was demonstrated that the correlation between lake area and precipitation is the strongest, followed by temperature, while there is no correlation with humidity. This research can provide valuable insights for policymakers and water resource managers.																			1472-7978	1875-8983				MAR	2025	25	2					1432	1447		10.1177/14727978241299700	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/14727978241299700		NOV 2024											WOS:001467457200001

Dail			Wetland pulse amplitude better predicts aquatic species richness than static wetland size	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Pond drying is integral to the structuring of aquatic faunal assemblages by filtering species by larval development time and via the identity of top predators. The effects of seasonal habitat size fluctuations on aquatic community assemblages, however, are not well known. As such, few studies have quantitatively investigated the role of seasonal habitat expansion on wetland community structure in natural settings. In this study, we examine a series of naturally occurring fishless ponds across a size and permanence gradient to assess the importance of hydrological expansion on aquatic faunal diversity. We measured the extent of the shift in the aquatic terrestrial transition zone throughout the year by mapping pond perimeters, thus quantifying the area of periodically flooded riparian zones. Aquatic fauna (insects, larval anurans, and decapods) was surveyed by dipnet and identified to species. Relative primary productivity was estimated using periphyton accumulation rates. Primary productivity rates were positively influenced by the size of the aquatic habitat expansion area. Aquatic habitat pulse amplitude was a better predictor of species richness than median size estimates in our regression models. These results emphasize the need to better understand the mechanisms driven by annual cycles of expansion and contraction that shape wetland community structure.

In-lake remediation measures can be applied to reduce internal P loading and to achieve ecosystem recovery. The eutrophic shallow peat lake Terra Nova (The Netherlands) was treated with iron (Fe) to enhance P retention in the sediment. This treatment, however, intensified seasonal internal P loading. An earlier study suggested that Fe addition led to increased P binding by easily-reducible Fe(iii) associated with organic matter (OM), which readily releases P when bottom waters turn hypoxic. In this complementary study, bulk and micro Fe K-edge and P K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy and micro-focused X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy were applied to characterize the P hosting Fe(iii) pool. Combined with sequential extraction data, the synchrotron X-ray analyses revealed that a continuum of co-precipitates of Fe(iii) with calcium, phosphate, manganese and organic carbon within the OM matrix constitutes the reducible Fe(iii) pool. The complementary analyses also shed new light on the interpretation of sequential extraction results, demonstrating that pyrite was not quantitatively extracted by nitric acid (HNO3) and that most of the Fe(ii) extracted by hydrochloric acid (HCl) originated from phyllosilicate minerals. Formation of an amorphous inorganic-organic co-precipitate upon Fe addition constitutes an effective P sink in the studied peaty sediments. However, the high intrinsic reactivity of this nanoscale co-precipitate and its fine distribution in the OM matrix makes it very susceptible to reductive dissolution, leading to P remobilization under reducing conditions.

J	Jakubik, B				Jakubik, Beata			INVERTEBRATE REPRODUCTION IN ASTATIC WATER BODIES: EGG NUMBER - BODY WEIGHT RELATIONSHIP IN VIVIPARUS VIVIPARUS (L.) FROM OXBOW LAKES	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Reproduction is the most important factor in population dynamics and invading freshwater habitats by Viviparus viviparus. This is largely associated with ovoviviparity of these snails. Some traits like steered reproduction, the appearance of young snails during the whole year, protection of embryos by female and delayed reproduction were fixed by natural selection as adaptations increasing the chance for progeny survival. In variable habitats like oxbow lakes seasonally joined to the river channel, Viviparidae start reproducing in the early stage of their life hence increasing a chance for population to survive. Studies on fecundity, embryonic development of V. viviparus and the relationships between these parameters and females' body size and weight, were carried out in oxbow lakes periodically connected to the river (the Bug River, Central Poland). The Bug River is one of a few European rivers which preserved their nearly natural character. No larger hydrotechnical works have been made in its valley, therefore, the river flows in a natural, meandering channel and forms numerous oxbow lakes. The surrounding of studied oxbow lakes is flat and of lowland character with mixed land use structure (arable lands, grasslands, settlements). Oxbow lakes are fed by the runoff from flood terrace, hence their waters are more fertile than those of the river. Two lakes were selected: Lake Szumin, area 17 ha, Lake Wywloka - area 23 ha. Maximum depth of both lakes is ca 3 m. Samples of V viviparus were collected in the years 2003-2007 with a bottom drag during the successive seasons from five sites in each oxbow lake. The embryos were found in females of the II (8.1-12.0 mm of width and height), III (12.1-20.0 mm width and 12.1-25.0 mm height) and IV (over 25.0 mm height and over 20.0 mm width) size classes. Three developmental stages were distinguished in embryonic growth: the oval transparent egg capsules (called the youngest embryos), egg capsules with visible contour of a shell (called medium embryos) and snails with a shell (the oldest embryos). The youngest growth stages of embryos (in a form of oval transparent egg capsules) dominated in all size classes of females. Medium growth stages (egg capsules with visible outlines of the shell) and the oldest ones (with shell) were represented in smaller proportion. The highest number of the youngest embryos per female were found in females of the II size class. The proportions of the embryo growth stages varied seasonally. The number of embryos per female and the degree of their development increased with the increase of shell (height, width, dry weight) and body (dry weight) parameters. High fecundity of the youngest females of V viviparus is probably an adaptation to unstable habitat conditions of oxbow lakes.																			1505-2249						2012	60	2					363	374																WOS:000305373600012
J	Kaeding, LR				Kaeding, Lynn R.			Are Yellowstone Lake Temperatures More Suitable to Nonnative Lake Trout than to Native Cutthroat Trout?	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												A recent study revealed limitations to the reproduction potential of Yellowstone cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri (YCT) in Yellowstone Lake, Wyoming, resulting from suboptimal conditions for somatic growth. The present study evaluated the lake as suitable thermal habitat for YCT and lake trout Salvelinus namaycush, a highly piscivorous, nonnative species, a reproducing population of which was discovered there in 1994. Because the fundamental thermal niche of lake trout delimits a zone of the lake's annual temperature profile that surrounds the corresponding, separate zone for YCT, the annual growing season and volume of suitable Yellowstone Lake habitat will invariably be larger for lake trout than YCT across the range of cool-to-warm climate years. Ongoing management actions to control lake trout emphasize intensive gill netting, while temporal changes in lake trout catch rates and population structure provide metrics of program success. However, the limits to YCT reproduction potential attributed to the short growing season make the YCT population especially susceptible to lake trout predation, perhaps even from a measurably reduced predator population. Identification of such effects requires that dynamic, age-structured models of the YCT population that incorporate all important population drivers be formulated and used in data analyses and control program assessment.

Eight kinds of carotenoids were detected in the sediments, i.e., astaxanthin and lutein from chlorophytes, alloxanthin from cryptophytes, canthaxanthin, echinenone and zeaxanthin from cyanobacteria, diatoxanthin from diatoms, and beta-carotene from unspecified algal groups. On the basis of the stoichiometric relation between total organic carbon (TOC) and total sulfur (TS), the historical changes in the TOC concentration of sediment cores since circa 1970 have been attributable to the decomposition of organic matter by sulfate reduction, confirming the importance of diagenetic processes in Lake Shinji sediments. It was found that labile chlorophyll a is transformed diagenetically to more stable pheophytin a and pyropheophytin a within the upper 5 cm of the cores. Similarly, the concentrations (mu g g(-1) TOC) of carotenoids, other than diatoxanthin, in the cores decreased rapidly within this zone, and in the cores lower than 5 cm below lake floor, their concentrations showed a decreasing or fixed trend with depth. This suggests that these carotenoids have been degraded in sediments depending on their stabilities. Among the diatoxanthin, lutein and zeaxanthin of which the stability is similar, the relative abundance of lutein (chlorophytes) has increased since circa 1970, and, conversely, the relative abundance of diatoxanthin (diatoms) has decreased. Diatoms are likely a staple food for the shellfish Corbicula japonica in Lake Shinji, because they are rich in lipids, which are needed for the growth and survival of C. japonica. Hence, the relative decrease in the number of diatoms may have some effect on the decrease in the population of C. japonica since the 1970s in the lake.

However, in a dynamic aquatic ecosystem the N:P stoichiometry of phytoplankton is highly variable depending on a range of factors that influence their growth. In this study, a 1D hydrodynamic-ecological model was used to examine how the internal nutrient ratios of phytoplankton relate to nutrient ratios within the water column in Lake Kinneret, Israel. We identified that seasonal patterns of the simulated dissolved inorganic N to total P (DIN:TP) ratios in the water column were a useful indicator of the N:P stoichiometry of the combined phytoplankton community. However, the internal N:P patterns of individual phytoplankton groups did not necessarily relate to DIN:TP patterns. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B. V.

PHYTOPLANKTON ECOLOGY AND HYDROLOGICAL DYNAMICS OF THE YAHUARCACA LAGOON SYSTEM, AMAZONAS, COLOMBIA: INTEGRATED ANALYSIS OF SIXTEEN YEARS OF STUDY	MUNDO AMAZONICO												This article provides a synthesis of the current knowledge on the evolving relation between the Amazon River and the Yahuarcaca lagoon system, through the limnological features and the ecology of phytoplankton in a period of sixteen years. The synthesis of the information was conducted by reviewing existing data about the system, for the time indicated, and analyzing it by means of descriptive statistics and linear correlation between the variables found. Also, it contains a summary of the most important aspects of the first attempt in Colombia to evaluate the influence of the flood pulse on the phytoplankton in a daily time scale. The thermal pattern of this laggon system corresponds to a warm and constant polymicthic lake type according to the de Lewis (1983) classification. The physical, chemical and biological variables examined in this varzea system change according to the hydrologic period. The conductivity, transparency and richness of the phytoplankton increase in the low water season, while the nutrient concentration, and the density, productivity and the biomass of phytoplankton increase during the high water season. Nitrate during the low water season and phosphate during the high water season are the most restricting nutrients. The changes that have taken place through these years in the connectivity between the river and the Yahuarcaca lagoon system are reflected in the dynamics of the structure and composition of the phytoplankton.

Detection of temporary flooded areas with potential floodwater mosquito production using imaging radar	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Temporarily flooded areas can produce enormous numbers of floodwater mosquitoes, causing tremendous nuisance to people living in the vicinity. The aim of this study is to develop a remote-sensing method for detecting temporary flooded areas that can produce floodwater mosquitoes. For this objective, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery from the European Remote Sensing satellite (ERS-2) and the Environmental Satellite (Envisat) are chosen. The images cover both flooded and dry periods around Lake Farnebofjarden, located in the lowlands of the River Dalalven, central Sweden, during the vegetation season between 2000 and 2006. Unsupervised classification and principal component analysis (PCA) are tested as methods for detecting floodwater mosquito production sites. In the unsupervised classification experiment, four types of images are tested. The classification of a synthetic colour image gives the best result with an overall accuracy of 85.7% and a kappa value of 0.7, as well as a 46% detection rate of field-mapped flooded areas. PCA is performed on a data set of 16 time series radar images. The resulting principal component (PC) bands provide information about flooding probability as well as vegetation structures. Regular flooding increases the probability for an area to provide breeding sites for floodwater mosquitoes. Thus, this approach will be very useful in estimating the risk of floodwater mosquito establishment.																			0143-1161						2012	33	6					1943	1953		10.1080/01431161.2011.604053	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2011.604053													WOS:000302162000016

Thus, there is a wide over-lap with the hydrosphere. The cryosphere is an integral part of the global climate system with important linkages and feedbacks generated through its influence on surface energy and moisture fluxes, clouds, precipitation, hydrology, atmospheric and oceanic circulation. Through these feedback processes, the cryosphere plays a significant role in global climate and in climate model response to global change. The World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) established the Climate and Cryosphere (CliC) Project in 2000 as an evolution from the Arctic Climate System Study (ACSYS) with a global focus on the cryosphere and all its components in the Earth system. The CliC Project coordinates and enables research on (a) terrestrial cryosphere and hydroclimatology of cold regions with special focus on the carbon budget and permafrost, (b) ice masses and sea level which includes ice sheets, ice caps and glaciers, (c) the marine cryosphere and climate which includes all forms of sea ice and (d) the global predictions and the cryosphere to improve the prediction for regional climate models with the inclusion of cryospheric components.

Effects of egg oiling on ground-nesting double-crested cormorants at a colony in Lake Ontario: an examination of nest-attendance behaviour	WILDLIFE RESEARCH												Context. We assessed the effects of egg oiling on ground-nesting double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) in the context of an emerging management strategy for the largest known cormorant colony on the lower Great Lakes. We designed the present study to answer specific questions in response to concerns raised by stakeholders and members of the public regarding this management technique. Aims. The aim of the present study was to examine the behavioural response of adult cormorants to egg oiling. Prior work on this issue has focussed on population-response questions rather than the behavioural level. Consequently, detailed observations on how cormorants respond to egg oiling are lacking. Methods. Using instantaneous and focal observations to measure behaviours, we compared Treatment nests (n = 24, 23) to Control (n = 24) and Sham (handled, but not treated; n = 24) nests. We observed nest attendance, incubation and mate-presence behaviour, and divided observations into pre-chick and entire-season categories for analysis. Key results. Our study determined that egg oiling does not cause immediate nest desertion by adult birds; Treatment birds incubated their nests as long as did Sham and Control birds. We found no difference among the three groups in the proportion of time a mate was present during incubation for Control and Sham nests in the pre-chick period. We found that the total seasonal duration of nest attendance by Treatment birds was shorter than that for the birds in the other groups. Conclusions. Both incubation and mate-presence data suggest that egg oiling did not measurably affect the behaviour of adult cormorants in the pre-chick period. Our study also suggests that Treatment birds attended their nest long enough to preclude re-nesting within the breeding season, although this may not apply for regions with longer nesting seasons. Implications. Our study indicates that egg oiling, administered judiciously, may be an appropriate management technique for ground-nesting cormorants, although management targets must be clearly articulated.																			1035-3712	1448-5494					2012	39	4					329	335		10.1071/WR11035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WR11035													WOS:000304450100007

The annual average, maximum and minimum area of Gahai Lake increased year after year. Due to some recovery measures, such as the Project "Zhongqu River Water to Gahai Lake" and the Project "Converting Grazing to Grassland", Gahai Lake area expanded quickly.

J	Yin, XM; Lu, XG; Xue, ZS; Liu, ZM				Yin, Xiaomin; Lu, Xianguo; Xue, Zhenshan; Liu, Zhengmao			Influence of land use change on water quality in Naoli River watershed, northeast China	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT												Stream water quality can be dramatically affected by land use changes. Many studies in the past few decades have found that watersheds with a greater proportion of agricultural land use tend to supply greater amounts of nutrients to surface waters and conversion of natural landscapes for agricultural or urban usage tends to cause deterioration of water quality in temperate areas. In the past few decades, lot of wetlands have been converted to cropland in Naoli River watershed and there has experienced an intensive land use change. In this study, we assessed the impact of land use change on water quality in Naoli River watershed by analyzing the ions of seasonal water samples during base flow conditions. The results showed that the concentrations of SO42-, HCO3- and Mg2+ showed significant seasonal variation (p=0.05) while others not. Upland and residential area converted from wetland have deteriorated the water quality. Upland has more significant negative influences on water quality than that of paddy rice fields. Changing the upland into paddy field in Naoli River watershed after 1990s has eased the deterioration of water quality. Paddy fields in the watershed have the similar effects on ions in water as that of the natural wetland. Forests in the watershed can mitigate the deterioration of water quality. Although there is not very significant relationship between wetland and water quality deterioration (p<0.05), more attention still need to be paid to the effect of wetland loss and the increase of upland and residential area in the future land use planning of the watershed. It can be concluded that establishment of the relationship between percentage of land use and water quality parameters can help evaluate the influence of human activities on water quality at watershed scale.

J	Mvula, A; Tawara, D; Maruyama, A				Mvula, Andrew; Tawara, Daisuke; Maruyama, Atsushi			Using micro-CT to explore bone density variations in the skulls of the vulnerable Opsariichthys uncirostris uncirostris (Three-lips fish) during reproductive migration to a Lake Biwa tributary	PLOS ONE												Not much is known about the changes in bone density due to fish reproductive migration. We used micro-CT and inferential statistics to determine whether the relative bone density in the skulls of adult Three-lips fish, that seasonally upstream migrated to a Lake Biwa tributary, changed across their known reproductive season. The relative bone density significantly decreased as standard length and condition factor (K) increased in both sexes. This negative relationship is likely due to age and hormonal effects in the fish. Results from the bone density analysis also revealed that male Three-lips fish had potentially lower relative bone density (although not significantly different) than females during peak reproductive migration, i.e., July to August. On average, male Three-lips fish are larger in length and weight than females, and in many species, females prefer larger males to smaller males, viewing their size as an indicator of genetic fitness and their ability to provide protection. Resources in the skulls of Three-lips males may be distributed in such a way that increases reproductive success, i.e., size at the expense of quality. In addition, individuals with slightly less dense bones, particularly males, appeared later than those with denser bones during the peak of the reproductive season. The high energy demands involved with aggression in males, often requires resource mobilization from various tissue compartments and could explain the slightly lower density in the latter half of the peak migration. Furthermore, Three-lips individuals that migrated earlier and later during the reproductive season may have more energy reserves than those that had been in the river for some time, hence the variable bone density between individuals. This study serves as a foundation for future studies on the effects of migration, changes in physiology and age on bone density analysis of Three-lips fish and other species in various ecosystems.

J	Vila-Gispert, A; Moreno-Amich, R				Vila-Gispert, A; Moreno-Amich, R			Life-history strategies of native and introduced fish species from a Mediterranean lake	ANIMAL BIOLOGY												Seven life-history traits were used to describe the life-history strategies of 12 native and introduced species from a permanent lake in Spain. Multivariate analysis identified a continuum of life-history patterns between two extremes: 1) species with one or few spawnings per year, short breeding season, long generation time, large size, high fecundity, and no parental care. This set of life-history traits corresponded to the periodic life-history strategy described by Winemiller (1989) and Winemiller and Rose (1992); and 2) species with multiple spawnings per year, prolonged breeding season, short generation time, small size, low fecundity, parental care, and small to medium size of eggs. This association of life-history traits corresponded to the opportunistic life-history strategy described by Winemiller (1989) and Winemiller and Rose (1992). It seems that there were no apparent differences in life-history strategies between native and introduced species in Lake Banyoles. Native and introduced species were found among periodic and opportunistic strategists. Observed differences in the success of native and introduced species with comparable life-history strategies seems to suggest that the success of fish species in Lake Banyoles could not be explained on the basis of life-history features. Nevertheless, it seems that successful invasive species in Lake Banyoles display a suite of traits such as high fecundity, late maturity, and large body size. These characteristics may perhaps be viewed as biological predictors of successful invaders but more information is needed about life-history features of successful introduced species from other ecosystems.

J	Albuquerque, ALS; Mozeto, AA				Albuquerque, ALS; Mozeto, AA			C:N:P ratios and stable carbon isotope compositions as indicators of organic matter sources in a riverine wetland system (Moji-Guacu River, Sao Paulo-Brazil)	WETLANDS												Particulate organic carbon (POC), particulate nitrogen (PN), particulate phosphorus (PP) concentrations, and stable carbon isotope compositions (delta(13)C) are reported for Moji-Guacu River (suspended matter) and Infernao Lake (suspended matter and bottom sediment) samples collected during the entire 1990/91 hydrologic year. POC and PN concentrations for both systems and riverine PP concentrations peaked during the wet season, but only riverine PP concentrations peaked together with the river discharge, thus characterizing the regional watershed (main river) as the principal source of this phosphorus. Lacustrine POC, PN, and PP displayed maximum concentrations before discharge peak, suggesting that local sources (lake basin, wetlands, and internal production) are more important in the lake case. A less pronounced increase in riverine PN than in POC or PP increments also was documented, possibly due to denitrification occurring in the river-wetland system. The principal source of organic matter in the Moji-Guacu River is watershed inputs. The origin of suspended matter in the oxbow lake is mainly phytoplankton, while bottom sediments are composed by a more refractory fraction of organic matter derived from local runoff, lake macrophytes, and riverine POM, with some contribution of lake POM subjected to alteration by early diagenetic processes.

For this purpose, sediments from lakes Dang, Massote, Fonjak and Ngaoundaba were studied through lithologic analysis including mineralogical composition and organic geochemistry combined with radiocarbon dates. From these analyses, the sediments at the base of lakes Massote and Dang cores are respectively dated to 4680-3530 and 4220-3580 cal yr BP, whereas the sediments of lakes Fonjak and Ngaoundaba seem to be younger, respectively dated to 3210-3000 and 1870-1740 cal yr BP. Lake sedimentation is dominated by organic matter (OM) poor deposits (OM < 3%) in the lower sections and OM-rich deposits (OM: 5-54%) in the upper sections. This shift from OM-poor to OM-rich sedimentation induced by climate variations occurred at similar to 2800-2400 cal yr BP. The mineral assemblage is predominantly composed of kaolinite with minor contributions from chlorite, smectite, chlorite/smectite, illite/smectite, quartz, K-feldspar, gibbsite, plagioclase, siderite, hematite and goethite. These sediments are clastic, except for Lake Fonjak core sediments which correspond to peat intercalated with carbonate clay and clastic deposits. Age-depth models suggest that the sedimentation rate was 0.2 mm yr(-1) for lakes Dang and Massote before similar to 690-560 cal yr BP and similar to 660-470 cal yr BP, respectively. Thereafter, it increased to 0.8 mm yr(-1) in Lake Dang and 0.7 mm yr(-1) in Lake Massote. Finally, Late Holocene environment changes in Central Cameroon consisted of the shift of open water lakes to marshy fringes with abundant vegetation induced by human activities and facilitated by increasing seasonality.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				FEB	2025	73	1					1	22		10.1007/s10933-024-00342-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-024-00342-y		NOV 2024											WOS:001349430400001
J	Danish, M; Tripathy, GR				Danish, Mohd; Tripathy, Gyana Ranjan			Dominant Production of Dissolved Inorganic Carbon by Organic Matter Degradation in a Coastal Lagoon: Evidence from Carbon Isotopes	ACS EARTH AND SPACE CHEMISTRY												Coastal oceanic settings are biogeochemically active zones and play a dominant role in the global carbon cycle. In this contribution, we have investigated the spatial distribution of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and delta C-13(DIC) along the salinity gradient of a large tropical coastal lagoon (Chilika, India) and major source waters (river, groundwater) to the lagoon for three different (pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon) seasons. These data were used to constrain internal cycling and DIC fluxes to the Bay of Bengal. The average [DIC] and delta C-13(DIC) values of the Chilika, although they exhibit significant variation within a season, are found comparable for the pre-monsoon (1.8 +/- 0.6 mM; -5 +/- 3 parts per thousand), monsoon (1.7 +/- 0.4 mM; -4 +/- 2 parts per thousand), and post-monsoon (1.9 +/- 0.3 mM; -4 +/- 3 parts per thousand) samples. Co-variation between DIC (and delta C-13(DIC)) and salinity during all three seasons deviates from the theoretical mixing line (TML) between river and seawater, indicating nonconservative behavior of DIC in the lagoon. The magnitude of the DIC and delta(CDIC)-C-13 deviations from their corresponding TML points to dominancy of organic matter degradation in causing this nonconservative trend. Additionally, the pre-monsoon samples also show a minor effect of calcite precipitation on the [DIC]. The LOICZ model estimates that the DIC flux from this lagoon to the ocean is higher than that reported for several peninsular Indian rivers, despite their high (378 km(3)/yr) freshwater influxes to the Bay of Bengal. This disproportionally higher DIC flux is linked to remineralization of organic matter, underscoring its importance in regulating the inorganic carbon cycle of this highly productive coastal system.																			2472-3452					NOV 5	2024	8	11					2155	2165		10.1021/acsearthspacechem.4c00148	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsearthspacechem.4c00148		NOV 2024											WOS:001348642400001
J	Belant, JL				Belant, Jerrold L.			Human-caused mortality and population trends of American marten and fisher in a US national park	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												American marten (Martes americana) and fisher (M. pennanti) are susceptible to overharvest. National Park Service policies require managers to ensure long-term population viability of native wildlife while concurrently provide recreation opportunities, which can include harvest of wildlife. I investigated human-caused mortality factors of American martens and fishers in Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore (PRNL), Michigan, from May-December 2001-2005. Thirty-five martens and 14 fishers were captured and survival was monitored using radio telemetry. Four martens were legally trapped, one marten was killed by a vehicle collision within PRNL, and three martens died of natural causes. The only fisher mortality was through legal trapping within PRNL. In addition, vehicles in the study area killed an uncollared marten and fisher. Greatest marten mortality occurred during the harvest season in December, with only males reportedly harvested. Overall, marten and fisher survival from June-December was 0.803 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.689 to 0.882) and 0.812 (95% CI: 0.374 to 0.977), respectively. Using survival rates from this study and reported rates of fecundity, I estimated that current marten mortality rates are sustainable and that the population was increasing at a rate of 16%/year. Survival data and harvest records suggest that the fisher population is stable or increasing. Human-caused mortality appears to be the greatest source of mortality for martens and fishers at PRNL. Although current harvest rates are comparatively low, continued monitoring of harvest within and adjacent to PRNL, in addition to monitoring vehicle collisions, is warranted to ensure viable populations are maintained.

Uptake of Heavy Metals by Marine Aquatic Macrophytes	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY												The potential of algae to accumulate heavy metals in marine environments was studied. The aim is to study the accumulation of Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn, Mn, Fe, and Mg in algal biomass that grows in the Little Bitter Lake, Egypt. Consequently, the level of metals in twelve different algal species was studied extensively. The investigated algae belong to Green, Brown, and Red algae. The investigation includes the influence of seasonal variation on the rate of heavy metals accumulation by algae. Meanwhile, levels of metals in the Lake water were also assessed. The results indicated differences between the metal concentration and the different algal species. Furthermore, differences were also found in the levels of different metals within the studied algae. The overall results showed that the highest accumulation rate was exhibited by Red algae followed by Green and then Brown algal species. Correlation between the level of metals in the Lake Water and the studied algal species was conducted to determine the concentration factors for each metal. It was concluded that the bioaccumulation of heavy metals by aquatic algae is an indication of the availability of those metals within the aquatic environment.																			0449-2285	2357-0245				NOV	2024	67	11					471	477		10.21608/ejchem.2024.257942.9077	http://dx.doi.org/10.21608/ejchem.2024.257942.9077													WOS:001470334800037

Elevated total mercury (THg) levels in water sources under the influence of artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) in Tanzania	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												This study investigated the presence and distribution of mercury in water bodies under the influence of artisanal and small-scale mining (ASGM) activities in Tanzania, which continue to predominantly rely on mercury for gold extraction. Various water bodies available for domestic and animal use in mining communities were sampled from surface water sources in ASGM settlements during the rainy and dry seasons. Water samples were analysed using cold vapour atomic fluorescence spectrophotometer (CVAFS). The results indicate that most of water sources had THg levels above the WHO guideline of 1.0 mu g/L (1000 ng/L) for safe drinking water. The levels were significantly higher during the wet season ranging from 3.4 to 96.3 mu g/L, whereas the range was from 0.84 to 2.12 mu g/L during the dry period. The higher THg values during the wet season are likely a result of increased lateral transport (e.g. via enhanced runoff) and physical properties of the waterways. Transportation and resuspension of matrix-bound mercury from surface soils and inflow of contaminated water from unprotected tailings were also observed to be potential means of lateral mercury transport. The lowest concentrations (0.846 mu g/L) were observed in water samples from the Mabubi River, upstream of a mining village. Downstream of the mining village in the same river, higher concentrations were observed in the Nungwe Bay region of Lake Victoria. In other surveyed mining settlements where there were no nearby rivers, pool water indicated high concentrations of THg, including levels above thresholds for safe human use. Immediate stringent measures are needed in order to ensure human and animal safety at ASGM mining settlements. Future investigation is suggested to focus on the distribution of mercury in different media, assessing the prevalence of different mercury species, and investigating the influence of weather and hydrological conditions on the impacts of mercury to organisms as part of the strategies to mitigate mercury pollution.					; Mariki, Eliapenda Elisante/AAU-5304-2021	Mariki, Eliapenda/0000-0002-8278-6048; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				NOV	2024	196	11							1036	10.1007/s10661-024-13210-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-024-13210-z								39382698					WOS:001337112500004
J	Rogora, M; Giacomotti, P; Orrù, A; Tartari, G; Paro, L				Rogora, Michela; Giacomotti, Paola; Orru, Arianna; Tartari, Gabriele; Paro, Luca			Evaluating water quality of rock glacier outflows in the Western Alps, Italy: a regional perspective	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Intact rock glaciers (RG) are considered valuable water storage because containing permafrost ice volumes. The hydrological relevance of RG is forecasted to increase with respect to glaciers under climate change scenarios, as well as RG's role as water resources in alpine basins for multiple uses. Besides the assessment of water amount stored in intact rock glaciers, the evaluation of water quality is of primary importance. Here, we present the results of a chemical survey performed on five outflows from intact RG in 2020-2023 in the Piedmont region, Western Alps, Italy, along a latitudinal gradient and in different geological settings. The survey aimed to assess the water quality of RG outflows based on chemical indicators (major ions, nutrients, trace metals). Sampling and analyses were performed according to standard methods for freshwater samples, paying specific attention to the analytical quality and consistency of the data. We considered seasonal and interannual variability of the main chemical variables and the possible effects of RG outflows on the chemistry of lakes and ponds located in proximity to the RG. All the investigated sites were characterized by low to moderate ion content, low nutrients, and trace metals close to or below the detection limit, indicating a good water quality status. Results suggested lithology as the main factor affecting the chemical composition of RG outflows. The results of this study indicate it is advisable to develop shared protocols and joint monitoring programs for data collecting at RG outflow sites all over the Alps, possibly integrating chemical and biological indicators, with the final aim of monitoring the water quality of these valuable resources and its temporal evolution under climate change.

Despite their critical role, the influence of specific hydrological and ecological factors on zooplankton community assembly and diversity remains poorly understood. We employed various methods to clarify how aquatic communities assemble and maintain diversity in these habitats. We calculated water age with the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) and identified zooplankton using environmental DNA (eDNA) technology. We used these data to explore the relationship between zooplankton assembly, water age, and other ecological factors in Poyang Lake, China's largest freshwater lake. We identified 1,142 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), mainly from Rotifera and Copepoda, representing the zooplankton community. The main driving factors for community differences were water age and total nitrogen. Water age ranged from 179 days to less than 1 day, with substantial spatial differences increasing from the western to the eastern region, particularly during the flood period (April-October). Spatial heterogeneity in other environmental factors, such as total nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon, and chlorophyll-a, also significantly impacted the zooplankton community composition. The assembly of the zooplankton community in Poyang Lake was primarily influenced by homogeneous selection, dispersal limitation, and ecological drift. During the flooding season, strong hydrodynamic forces created quick flush conditions that increased dispersal limitations, affecting the assembly process. Additionally, homogeneous selection played a major role in shaping community composition in seasonally inundated alluvial lands. This study found that water age, total nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon, and chlorophyll-a all contribute to intra-lake differences in the assembly processes of zooplankton communities in floodplain lakes. These findings improve our understanding of floodplain lake ecology, offering valuable insights for conservation biodiversity in floodplain lake.					; Qin, Boqiang/E-5900-2013	Zhang, Qingji/0000-0002-9426-7157; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				DEC	2024	645		B						132252	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.132252	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.132252		OCT 2024											WOS:001348469600001
J	Kirkwood, AE; Chow-Fraser, P; Mierle, G				Kirkwood, AE; Chow-Fraser, P; Mierle, G			Seasonal mercury levels in phytoplankton and their relationship with algal biomass in two dystrophic shield lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Our study focused on the seasonal dynamics of total Hg in the phytoplankton (living and dead) of two dystrophic shield lakes (Mouse and Ranger). Phytoplankton samples were taken from metalimnetic and hypolimnetic depths in the euphotic zone and were collected and analyzed using ultraclean techniques. In both lakes, phytoplankton Hg (PHYTO-Hg) levels (pg/L) in the metalimnion did not significantly change among dates over the season, although Ranger Lake exhibited significant differences between Hg values measured at the beginning and end of the season. In contrast, PHYTO-Hg significantly increased in the hypolimnia of both lakes by the end of the season. Combined influences of external Hg inputs, remineralization, phytoplankton sedimentation, and increased methylmercury production in the hypolimnia over the season may have contributed to these trends. A highly significant positive relationship existed between PHYTO-Hg levels and whole-water Hg levels (r(2) = 0.90), and the mean bioconcentration factor for Hg between the water column and phytoplankton was significantly higher in the hypolimnion compared to the metalimnion for both lakes. In mast cases, parameters associated with algal biomass had significant positive correlations with PHYTO-Hg levels. Weight-specific PHYTO-Hg (pg/mg dry weight) varied significantly over the season, and there were interlake differences with respect to seasonal trends. On the basis of these results, we recommend that future sampling regimes include collection of phytoplankton at different limnetic depths throughout the season to account for spatial and temporal variations. Weight-specific Hg levels in phytoplankton could not be explained well by the parameters tested, and the only significant regressions were with parameters reflecting algal biomass. This study provides in situ evidence of Hg accumulation in lake phytoplankton as a function of algal biomass on a seasonal basis (as opposed to biodilution) and stresses the need to confirm these trends in other lake systems.

The spatial and seasonal patterns and stability of the Lake Whitefish fishery in Michigan waters of southern Lake Huron	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												ObjectiveGiven that the harvested fish from five separate fishing grounds belong to one large mixed population, our objective is to develop an overall abundance index for Lake Whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis in Michigan waters of southern Lake Huron.MethodsWe analyzed catch-and-effort data for individual fishing trips to five separate fishing grounds and used Bayesian information criterion to select the best model struture.ResultThe best model included the year x area x month interaction as a random effect, representing the random component in fishery dynamics that were influenced by both fishing practices and fish abundance. The best model also included the fixed effects of area x month interaction, a result consistent with our hypothesis that the seasonal spatial migrations of Lake Whitefish provide the links among the fisheries in separate fishing grounds, and the fishery yields from these separate areas were all dependent on the production in southern Lake Huron as a whole. After adjusting for the random effect of year x area x month interaction and the fixed effects of area x month interaction, the estimated patterns for the fixed year effect indicated that the Lake Whitefish abundance in Michigan waters of southern Lake Huron declined during the late 2000s but has been relatively constant after 2012.ConclusionThe declines in annual fishery yield were due to and could be explained more by the decreases in fish abundance through 2012 but thereafter primarily reflected the declines in annual fishing effort as the fisheries continued to adjust to the changed fishing conditions. We also provided general lessons for studying fisheries without fishery independent surveys but with detailed seasonal and spatial catch-and-effort data.

While watershed surveys have identified some drivers of aquatic DOM changes, national-scale knowledge remains limited. Spectral monitoring data from 721 aquatic DOMs in inland China were collected to predict and quantify the spectral properties of aquatic DOMs and the coupled effects of human activities and environmental factors by complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN), random forest (RF) and structural equation modeling (SEM). Our results show that the dataset is relatively evenly distributed in terms of flow regimes, and the data are adequately representative of various types of water in China. Although the performance of CEEMDAN is affected by the skewed distribution of data sampling points (453 and 449 for eastern regions and eutrophic waters, respectively), CEEMDAN effectively processes the spatial sequences of aquatic DOM spectra, which significantly improves the reliability of the machine learning model (by 13%-68%) and reduces the error (by 63%-92%). CEEMDAN-RF and SEM results indicate that longitude and latitude are the most important environmental factors affecting the spectral properties of aquatic DOM through temperature, light and land cover differences, reducing the biogenic properties of aquatic DOM. Unlike observations in small watersheds and estuaries, environmental factors of season, precipitation and salinity have weak effects on aquatic DOM. Furthermore, the biogenic character of aquatic DOM is enhanced by urban human activities, represented by urbanization, population, and impervious land fraction, which have long-lasting and strong impacts on aquatic DOM by driving water eutrophication and enhancing phytoplankton and microbial activity. Our study informs the prediction and quantification of coupled environmental and anthropogenic impacts on aquatic DOM at large scales.

Invasive species sustain double-crested cormorants in southern Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) have long and often been implicated in having detrimental effects on fisheries. Research has shown that the main components of cormorant diets vary significantly among forage, invasive, or economically important fish species. This study builds on previous work in the north basin of Lake Michigan by focusing on cormorant diet composition at their only significant nesting colony in the southern basin at East Chicago, Indiana where cormorant diet has been unstudied. Regurgitated pellets were collected from the colony and diagnostic bones were used to elucidate diet composition. Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), Lepomis spp., white perch (Morone americana) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were the most frequently found prey items depending on cormorant feeding period. Invasive species, most notably alewife, round goby, and white perch, contributed over 80% and 90% of the diet of cormorants by biomass and number, respectively. No salmonine species were detected suggesting that negative effects on this important fishery would likely occur only via direct competition for prey (e.g., alewife). Predation on yellow perch, which occurred mainly prior to and during the perch spawning season (i.e., of age-1 and older individuals), may warrant further study to quantify the effects on the local yellow perch population. However, because yellow perch abundance is thought to be currently limited by poor recruitment at age-0, these results do not support the active management of the cormorants at this colony to protect or recover local fisheries.

We used a scientometric perspective to summarize the knowledge about temporary lentic ecosystems in 19 Latin American and Caribbean countries. We conducted a topic search in Web of Science (WoS) using various keyword combinations of hydroperiod type (temporary, ephemeral, intermittent, episodic, and seasonal), type of aquatic lentic ecosystem (wetland, pond, pool, lake, and lagoon), and the name of the country. Final searches and screenings provided 608 publications. To analyze the data, we used 2 qualitative approaches. We generated word clouds to ascertain the primary research topics concerning temporary lentic waters in Latin America, and we constructed a bipartite network to visualize the geographical distribution of publications by topics. Knowledge gaps observed were geographical, encompassing disparities between and within countries, and thematic, because certain topics have received limited attention. Moreover, we detected a terminology gap: a lack of consensus about the terms associated with temporary waters, and a collaborative gap; the study of temporary waters has historically been fragmented in Latin America. Finally, we attempted to unravel the potential factors contributing to these knowledge gaps. By revealing major gaps in understanding the structure and functioning of temporary waterbodies in the region, our study provides a valuable tool for identifying pertinent future research areas.					; Lopez, Carlos/AAS-4155-2021; Boix, Dani/L-5190-2014; Barbosa, Luciana/B-5817-2018; López, Carlos/AAS-4155-2021; OLMO, CARLA/M-3353-2014; Ramos-Jiliberto, Rodrigo/F-3160-2013	Olmo, Carla/0000-0003-4658-5078; Lopez, Carlos/0000-0001-5267-7257; Boix, Dani/0000-0001-5468-2236; Gomes Barbosa, Luciana/0000-0002-2245-6119; 													2044-2041	2044-205X				OCT 1	2024	14	4			SI		336	351		10.1080/20442041.2024.2364966	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2024.2364966		OCT 2024											WOS:001338230600001

In this study, we investigated how the SOC content was determined by flooding duration and soil physicochemical variables in adjacent SF and NF at six depths (0-10 cm, 10-20 cm, 20-30 cm, 30-50 cm, 50-70 cm, and 70-100 cm) at Shengjin Lake in subtropical China. Soil physicochemistry and SOC composition were analyzed, and Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to resolve the SOC composition. Neither SOC content nor the vertical distribution of SOC was distinguishable between the sites. However, FTIR data revealed that plant-originated aliphatics and amides were higher at NF than SF sites, with the opposite pattern for aromatics. At SF sites, SOC content was positively affected by soil moisture and flooding duration and was negatively impacted by soil particle size at most soil layers. At NF sites, SOC content was mainly affected by silt and total Fe at the top 20 cm soil, while a higher fraction of plant-derived labile C was positively correlated to SOC contents at 30-100 cm depth. The results hence indicated a strong effect of seasonal flooding on SOC dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems. SOC stabilization induced by low mineralization and high adsorption played a central role at SF sites, while SOC formation through plant input was more important at NF sites. Our findings suggest that management strategies designed to conserve SOC will need to be site-specific.					; Shen, Ruichang/O-4305-2017; 郑, 博福/JAX-5796-2023; Rousk, Johannes/E-9741-2010; Rinklebe, Joerg/Y-2398-2019	Rinklebe, Joerg/0000-0001-7404-1639; Shen, Ruichang/0000-0003-0055-8058; Rousk, Johannes/0000-0002-4985-7262; 													1085-3278	1099-145X				JAN 15	2025	36	1					144	157		10.1002/ldr.5350	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.5350		OCT 2024											WOS:001337325300001

This study quantified the seasonal variations in concentrations of nine metals (Al, Cr, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Pb) in surface water and sediment samples of the largest brackish water lagoon in Asia (i.e., Chilika Lagoon), comparing pre-and post-COVID scenarios. The COVID lockdown resulted in a wide variation in metals concentrations, with surface water showing 1 to 8.6-fold reduction in metals such as Al, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Pb, while sediment displayed a more modest reduction of 1 to 1.3-fold. Metals like Cd, Co and Ni were below detection limit in post-COVID water samples with a slight decrease (1-fold) in the sediments. COVID lockdown did not show any significant correlation with metal concentrations in water or sediment.

The challenge of monitoring permafrost temperatures and identifying critical environmental factors is accentuated by the scarcity of subsurface thermal data in remote Arctic locales. To alleviate this lack of soil thermal data we set out to combine in situ observed soil temperatures with MERRA-2 reanalysis data and Machine Learning (ML) to develop local and season-specific subsurface soil temperature predictions in Alaska. First, reanalysis features are selected based on surface energy budget physics. Coupled with Julian calendar dates, reanalysis features are preprocessed and then fed to the ML prediction model. We conducted a series of computational experiments and tested the results against performance benchmarks to determine the optimal prediction models, length of look-back period of model inputs, and the training set size. Six conventional ML models (e.g., GBDT, RF, SVR) and five statistical baselines (e.g. ARIMA) using in situ time series of soil temperature data ranging from 0 - 1 m depth are considered for the prediction task. The models are trained using in situ soil temperatures at depths between 0 and 1 m, spanning 16+ years, from field sites at Deadhorse and Toolik Lake, Alaska. All prediction performances are assessed using root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). Results show that locally trained ML models can estimate shallow soil temperatures with an average error of RMSE=1.308 degrees\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$RMSE=1.308<^>{\circ }$$\end{document}C.

Lake catches of Orconectes virilis were correlated with water temperature; peak catches were late in the season when lakes were warmest although increases in temperature did not always bring increases in catch. Catches of O. propinquus in streams increased with increasing temperatures early in the season. However, during the remainder of the ice-free season, catches of O. propinquus were more closely related to the timing of life-history events. Peak catches for O. propinquus occurred between molting periods and after the females released young. Efficient harvest and management of crayfish in northern locations requires monitoring temperature and understanding life-history relationships.																			0018-8158					FEB 16	1996	319	2					111	118		10.1007/BF00016879	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00016879													WOS:A1996UE14700004

The water level and area of Zonag Lake have increased sharply since 2000, and the west lake bottom area was exposed after an outburst of flood in September 2011. The drained basin was exposed to the cold environment, causing rapid permafrost forming. In this paper, time-series synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) was utilized to monitor the surface deformation of the drained basin using Sentinel-1A images within a 4-year period (2017-2020). This research focused on characterizing the spatial and temporal dynamics of ground deformation and exploring changes in the permafrost base around the drained basin based on the deformation information. The experimental results revealed spatially variable ground deformation, with long-term deformation rates ranging from -78.3 mm/year to 72.8 mm/year and seasonal amplitudes of 0-14 mm. Subsidence was prominent in the lakeshore, the thermokarst region and the slope drainage area, indicative of the thawing of ice-rich permafrost. Conversely, uplift was concentrated in the exposed unconsolidated sediment region, with a maximum displacement of 110 mm over the nearly 4-year observation period, suggesting ground ice aggradation. The uplift information was used to estimate the change in the permafrost base in the drained basin, yielding a maximum value of 4 m. The estimated permafrost base change closely aligned with simulated results, with an error of 0.28 m. This study demonstrates the capability of InSAR in monitoring permafrost stability and improving the understanding of the dynamic permafrost formation process. Obvious ground subsidence around the Zonag Lake has been detected, and the subsidence trend is ongoing, which shows the permafrost thawing is continuous. The changes in the permafrost base have been retrieved based on the long-term deformation of permafrost.image					zhang, zhengjia/GWA-0586-2022; wang, mengyi/KEI-9461-2024	zhang, zhengjia/0000-0003-0930-6914; 													0197-9337	1096-9837				DEC	2024	49	15					5038	5053		10.1002/esp.6011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/esp.6011		OCT 2024											WOS:001331609100001

Growing season variability of nitrate along a trophic gradient - contrasting patterns between lakes and streams	AQUATIC SCIENCES												We studied the growing season (May to October) variability of NO(3)-N across Swedish lakes and streams. We found that NO(3)-N concentrations showed the highest growing season variability among all water chemical variables tested, both in lakes and in streams. However, the growing season variability of NO(3)-N increased with increasing trophic status in lakes while it decreased in streams. We attributed the contrasting pattern between lakes and streams to the relative importance of biological uptake and denitrification with increasing trophic status. Our results highlight the relation between growing season NO(3)-N variability and trophic status, which is positive in lakes but negative in streams. The findings of this study have important ramifications for ecosystem studies as well as water management. We suggest that the assessment of growing season variability of NO(3)-N in aquatic systems can be improved by considering the effect of trophic status.

Available information shows that regional artisanal fisheries, in addition to multispecific, are highly varied in their technology, geographically diffuse, and practiced with varying economic objectives. Two fisheries can be distinguished in the Middle Amazon. The first is more professionalized and highly seasonal in character, concentrates primarily on migratory catfish and operates primarily in the main river channels. The second fishery is more diffuse, focusing on smaller species in floodplain takes, adapting gear, location and target species to the ecological characteristics of the stock. Classical assessment models indicate some stocks my be overfished, such as Colossoma macropomum. Nevertheless, implementation of efficient regulatory measures is almost impossible. Although there are measures regulating fisheries, these regulations are not obeyed. As a result of the inability of the government to regulate the fishery, conflicts and litigation have proliferated over the right of access to local floodplain lake fisheries. In response to these actions, government institutions are changing their approach and their fisheries management policies. This is evident in increased government support for research projects and is leading to changes in fisheries legislation. Recently, a more decentralized approach to fisheries management has begun to take hold in government policy. In addition, social scientists have complained of the lack of attention to social dimensions of the fishery, questioning the validity of the bioeconomic paradigm for fisheries management. As a result of these questions, the participation of communities of fishers in discussions of regulatory measures is becoming the norm. Despite these changes, however, a mathematical model which takes into account the ecological, cultural, and social characteristics of the region has not yet been developed. On the other hand, the search for solutions cannot wait for the accumulation of data sets covering time periods long enough to permit more sophisticated approaches. Practical needs are imposing a system of resource evaluation which combines theoretical and empirical, conventional and alternative methods, and the development of multidisciplinary approaches, for the adoption of management measures.

Ruffe, a monotypic species, is found from the Baltic Sea to the Kolyma River. Recent evidence extends its distribution as far as the Arctic coast both in Europe and Asia. In the south, the range is restricted by the Caucasus in Europe, and in Asia by the Aml Sea basin and upper reaches of several large Siberian rivers. Ruffe usually have a narrow home range. Their seasonal migrations are related mainly To reproduction. In lakes and reservoirs, ruffe are found everywhere from shallow to the deepest zones. In rivers, they prefer sites with slow current. Ruffe show flexible foraging, breeding, and migratory behavior. Adults compete with common bream, roach, and benthivorous whitefishes, and are the prey of pikeperch, burbot, pike, large perch, and eel. The age of maturation is similar (2 to 3 years, sometimes I year) from the northern to southern areas. Fecundity tends to increase from north to south. Daily specific growth rate is rather constant everywhere; the fastest growth was observed in the newly-impounded reservoirs. Ruffe variability to a larger extent depends on local ecological situations rather than on latitudinal factors. Attempts to control ruffe populations with small-mesh seines were unsuccessful and only caused a reduction in average age of populations. Introduction of some piscivorous fishes (eel, pikeperch) was more efficient.

J	Admassu, D				Admassu, D			The breeding season of tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus L in Lake Awassa (Ethiopian rift valley)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The breeding season of Oreochromis niloticus in Lake Awassa was studied from fish caught monthly from December 1987 to November 1988 in relation to a number of environmental factors. Fish at various stages of gonad development and spawning were caught in almost all months, but breeding fish were more frequent twice a year: main peak occurred during January-March and a secondary one occurred during July-September. Gonadosomatic index (GSI) values peaked twice in the study year, a major peak being during January-March and a less pronounced one during July-September. Thus, it was concluded that O. niloticus in Lake Awassa breeds intensively in the former and less intensively during the latter period, and that some breeding occurs at any time of the year. Intensive breeding activity during January-March appeared associated with increase in solar radiation and sunshine hours d(-1) whereas that during July-September appeared associated with heavy rainfall. However, intensive breeding in both periods coincided with increase in phytoplankton biomass. Previously, phytoplankton biomass in this lake is shown to increase following increase in nutrients due to mixing- and rainfall-associated changes in the hydrography and hydrology of the lake. Thus, although further studies are required, increase in phytoplankton may be one of the environmental cues to stimulate spawning in O. niloticus in Lake Awassa whereas other factors such as sunshine and rainfall may have indirect roles through their effects on the hydrology and hydrography of the lake ultimately resulting in changes in phytoplankton biomass.																			0018-8158					NOV 1	1996	337	1-3					77	83		10.1007/BF00028508	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00028508													WOS:A1996WB14600007

Mean rates of biodeposition and excretion for Lampsilis radiata siliquoidea, the most abundant species, were 6.3-mu-g P (g shell-free dry wt)-1 h-1 and 1.3-mu-g P (g shell-free dry wt)-1 h-1, respectively; body tissue phosphorus content was 2.7 percent of dry wt. Seasonal changes in excretion rates appeared to be related to the gametogenic cycle of the organism, but seasonal changes in biodeposition rates were not apparent. Phosphorus assimilation efficiency for this species was about 40 percent. Overall, the mussel population in Lake St. Clair filtered about 210 MT of phosphorus, or about 13.5 percent of the total phosphorus load for the May-October study period. Of this amount, about 134 MT was sedimented to the bottom via biodeposition. Mussel biodeposition may be an important source of nutrients to other biotic components in the lake such as macrophytes and invertebrate deposit-feeders.																			0018-8158					JUL 26	1991	219						239	250		10.1007/BF00024758	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00024758													WOS:A1991GK03100016

Given the high retrieval accuracy from existing Earth observation satellite data, water colour, in terms of Forel Ule Index (FUI), can be a realistic indicator to track the long-term changes in the lake ecosystem and further explore the lake response to environmental changes. This paper aims to comprehensively investigate the spatiotemporal variation patterns of FUI in 159 large lakes (>= 25 km2) across China during 2000-2022 based on the MODIS data and detect the climatic and anthropogenic driving forces of these changes. The 23 years of MODIS records revealed an overall downward trend of lake FUI across China, indicating the lakes in China shifted to bluer colour during the past two decades. Through driving factor analyses, the complicated interplay among lake colour, lake morphology, regional climate shifts and human interference dynamics was uncovered. In the long term, it was found the pronounced change in lake colour in the western lake zones was primarily attributed to climate warming and humidification, whereas that in the eastern lake zones was mainly related to the alterations in regional land cover during the past two decades. Seasonally, lake basin's air temperature was identified as the main factor impacting the seasonal patterns of lake colour, followed by wind speed and runoff. Spatially, there was high spatial variability in lake colour across China, which was mainly associated with lake elevation and lake basin's precipitation rate, although the factors exhibited considerable divergence across different zones. Based upon the above findings, the implications for lake environment protection and management in different regions of China were further discussed.

At 5- to 6-week intervals, blood samples were collected to monitor plasma levels of 17 beta-estradiol (E-2), testosterone (T), thyroxine (T-4), 3.5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T-3), and calcium: packed cell volume (PCV); and differential blood cell counts. Fish were sacrificed after spawning to examine tissue P5CDF concentration, liver ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), liver vitamins (retinoids and tocopherol), histology (liver, thyroid), and growth parameters. The P5CDF injections produced tissue 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p dioxin toxic equivalent concentrations comparable to those reported in salmonids from contaminated areas. Highest P5CDF concentrations occurred in gut and liver, but muscle accounted for the greatest proportion of the dose. Plasma hormone and calcium concentrations followed predicted seasonal patterns in both control and exposed fish. PCV was unchanged by repeated blood sampling but differential blood cell counts showed adaptive responses to blood removal. The P5CDF exposure caused transient reductions in circulating lymphocytes and elevated EROD. Additionally, P5CDF increased liver size and depleted retinoid stores in male fish. Liver histology, somatic growth, and gonadal development were unaltered by P5CDF during the first reproductive cycle after exposure.					; Muir, Derek/F-6183-2011	Muir, Derek/0000-0001-6631-9776; 													0730-7268	1552-8618				MAY	1998	17	5					915	921		10.1002/etc.5620170521	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620170521													WOS:000073193200021

H.; Furey, Nathan B.; Moore, Jean-Sebastien			The potential of oviduct tags and fine-scale acoustic telemetry to reveal the timing and location of spawning in Arctic salmonids (Salvelinus spp.)	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Identifying and characterizing spawning locations are paramount for the protection of critical fish habitats but can be challenging, particularly in remote locations. Using the underexplored oviduct-tagging technique, we aimed to identify the timing and location of spawning for wild Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) and lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in two high-Arctic lakes in Nunavut. Specifically, Innovasea V7 acoustic telemetry transmitters were inserted into the oviducts of 13 Arctic char and 4 lake trout, and the timing and location of tag expulsion were determined using a fine-scale positioning system. Twenty Arctic char and 20 lake trout were also tagged with abdominal V16 transmitters, and 10 of them were paired with the oviduct tags, to further study the behavior of individual fish during the spawning season. Oviduct tags from four Arctic char and one lake trout could be used to assess the timing and location of spawning. Spawning anadromous Arctic char drastically reduced their activity and remained proximate to their presumed spawning location immediately before and for months after spawning. In contrast, a non-anadromous (i.e., freshwater resident) Arctic char and a lake trout showed little to no reduction in activity around presumed spawning events. Because of the highlighted sedentary behavior of inferred spawning anadromous Arctic char implanted with both abdominal and oviduct tags, we could also infer potential spawning based on the behavior of individuals equipped only with abdominal tags. Spawning areas identified via telemetry also aligned well with Inuit knowledge of those lakes.

Despite a limited success rate of ejection, the study reveals the strong potential of the method to study spawning habitat and timing, particularly in remote areas.

However, N2O 2 O emission fluxes, the underlying microbial mechanisms, and their feedbacks to global warming in the extensive WLFZ of the freshwater lakes with dramatic water-level variations remain unclear. Here, we sampled through both wet and dry seasons and compared the N removal rates, N2O 2 O emission fluxes, composition and co-occurrence network properties of the denitrifying microbial communities of the WLFZ, continuously flooded, and non-flooded zones covered with the dominant plant ( Carex. cinerascens) ) in Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake of China. We observed higher potential denitrification (1.129-5.657 nmol N g-1h- h- 1 ) and anammox (0.047-0.756 nmol N g1 h- 1 ) rates in the WLFZ for both wet and dry seasons than those in the other two zones. A large seasonal N2O 2 O sink-source transition (-2.297 and 0.297 mu g m-2h- h- 1 for wet and dry season, respectively) was observed in WLFZ. Moreover, the composition of nirK and nirS communities significantly varied in WLFZ between the wet and dry seasons. Especially, several keystone taxa (e.g., Mesorhizobium and Rhodanobacter) ) were enriched in the WLFZ and were responsible for denitrification and N2O 2 O emissions under drought stress in the dry season. Variations in denitrification rates and N2O 2 O fluxes were driven by pH, C and N substrates, as well as the co-occurrence network properties, including natural connectivity and small-world coefficients of the nirK and nirS communities. Our results suggested that WLFZ in freshwater lakes under future climate change scenarios would be a substantial N2O 2 O source and aggravate climate, which would result in the positive feedback.

However, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) released from t-OM might also support aquatic primary producers, a key resource for zooplankton and upper trophic levels. Using 2-yr 13C measurements of algae, zooplankton, terrestrial detritus, sediments, dissolved and particulate organic matter from six seasonal wetlands, we found that in January when algal concentration was low, zooplankton used t-OM directly or heterotrophic microbes that decompose t-OM, but in March and May zooplankton was mainly supported by algae as their basal resources, and the algae used DIC derived from the mineralization and methanogenesis of t-OM, suggesting the DIC pathway of terrestrial support of aquatic food webs. The decomposition of abundant t-OM from both bed sediments and water column caused high concentrations of DIC. Despite uptake by algae, about half of DIC produced in January and March ended up as emissions to the atmosphere in the form of CO2. This finding revealed the dual roles of t-OM in maintaining the productivity and stability of aquatic food webs and in contributing to global carbon emissions. This duality poses challenges for simultaneously mitigating carbon emissions and conserving biological communities in seasonal wetlands. Finally, wide seasonal differences in delta 13C in DIC (-12.4 parts per thousand to 6.7 parts per thousand) were observed, mainly driven by air-water CO2 exchange and photosynthesis, suggesting that 13C may be a powerful tool to investigate carbon cycling in shallow, temporary freshwater ecosystems that are widespread but understudied.

As result, icefish yield decreased over the years, from the peak of 260 metric tons to 15 metric tons, and this change was highly correlated (t = -3.95, df = 1, p = 0.001) with increased fishing effort. Meanwhile, the size composition of the icefish assemblage dramatically changed, with significantly increased relative abundance of the small icefish category (from 0.06 to 0.91). Furthermore, sampling during the 2001 fishing season was characterized by a progressive decrease in CPUE (by 3.14 times) and an increase in relative abundance (from 0.83 to 0.97) of the smallest icefish, giving direct evidence of the stocks decline and size diminution of icefishes in relation to the commercial fishing effort. Both the historical records and the 2001 seasonal changes of the icefish stocks indicated that this resource in Nanyi Lake has been overfished and illustrated that small fishes can also be overfished to degradation when they are commercially exploited.

The lake ecosystem of the Guozheng Hu area is dominated by two planktivorous fishes (silver carp and bighead carp), phytoplankton and zooplankton. Macrophytes are extremely scarce in this area. Concentrations of the total dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus in the Guozheng Hu area in 1990 were very high. Fish yield, of which, more than 90 % was composed of silver carp and bighead carp in the Guozheng Hu area was very high (ca. 1140 kg/ha or 45.6 g/m3 in 1990). Grazing pressure by the fishes on the plankton community is considered to be rather strong. The annual average biomass of zooplankton was ca. 1/3 - 1/2 that of phytoplankton. On the average, dry matter in the living plankton only constituted ca. 3-7 % of the total dry seston, and plankton carbon only constituted ca. 5 - 10 % of the seston carbon. The present results indicate that, in the Guozheng Hu area of the East Lake, of the organic part of the seston, detritus is quantitatively an important constituent, while living plankton is only a very small component.																			0003-9136					DEC	1993	129	2					199	220		10.1127/archiv-hydrobiol/129/1993/199	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/archiv-hydrobiol/129/1993/199													WOS:A1993MQ28200004

The marine influence associated with the Panthalassa Ocean, evident in the Silurian and Devonian deposits, was progressively attenuated in the late Carboniferous, culminating in extensive continental deposits during the Permian and the Early Triassic in this region. In this paper, we present the first palynofacies analysis of the Permian Pedra de Fogo Formation, conducted concurrently with the description and association of sedimentary facies from outcrops located in the state of Maranhao, southwest of the Parnaiba Basin. A total of 15 m of sedimentary succession was described, and 28 samples were selected for palynofacies analysis. As a result, we identified six sedimentary facies, which were grouped into two distinct facies associations: Fa1 - Central Lake and Fa2 - Playa Lake. The palynofacies analysis considered the sedimentary organic matter, classifying it into amorphous organic matter, phytoclasts (subdivided into eight subgroups), and palynomorphs (with six subgroups). Integrating the results enabled an understanding of the depositional context, which is closely related to water dynamics and climate seasonality. The shallow lake system interpreted during the wet phases recorded interruptions in the normal sedimentation of the central lake due to turbidite deposits associated with ephemeral rivers. Conversely, during dry phases, salt precipitation occurred with subsequent substitution and aerial exposure of the surface when the water balance was negative. Eodiagenetic events were inferred and are considered throughout the article. The alternation of the hydrological regime allowed the deposition in proximal, transitional, and distal environments, creating a distinctive mosaic of wetland landscapes. The data presented indicate humid conditions within a context of increasing aridity in the studied location, particularly in the upper part of the Pedra de Fogo Formation.					; Cesar Rodrigues Nogueira, Afonso/MCI-8667-2025; Souza, Paulo/O-9779-2018; Fambrini, Gelson Luis/J-6499-2015; Góes, Ana/M-4518-2017; Fambrini, Gelson/J-6499-2015	Goes, Ana Maria/0000-0001-8575-1935; Felix, Cristina/0000-0001-6865-7437; Fambrini, Gelson Luis/0000-0001-9663-2229; Oliveira, Edvaldo Jose/0000-0003-3730-8511													0895-9811	1873-0647				NOV 15	2024	148								105177	10.1016/j.jsames.2024.105177	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsames.2024.105177		OCT 2024											WOS:001347564000001

Initial and boundary values were interpolated from ECMWF analyses. Climatologies for a typical dry season month (July 1994) and wet season month (March 1994) were created by 7-day segmenting. Model results were validated by utilizing a special coastal observation network. A number of experiments were made with changes to the physiography (mountains/no mountains, lake/no lake). The results reveal local channelling and blocking effects of the near-surface southeasterly trade winds by the high mountain chains in the region of the East African rift. Furthermore, surface winds display regular diurnal cycles in many places, due to slope winds over hills and lake-landtype breezes near the coast. The diurnal coastal winds (defined by the observation network) are reasonably well simulated. Precipitation patterns display the semi-annual march of the ITCZ across the area, plus considerable topographic effects. There is high evaporation from lakes and wetlands during the windy dry season, while evaporation from the moist land surface dominates the rainy season.																			0177-7971						2000	73	1-2					77	88		10.1007/s007030050066	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s007030050066													WOS:000086034100007
J	Manobianco, J; Nutter, PA				Manobianco, J; Nutter, PA			Evaluation of the 29-km Eta model. Part II: Subjective verification over Florida	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												This paper describes a subjective evaluation of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction 29-km (Meso) Eta Model during the 1996 warm (May-August) and cool (October-January) seasons. The companion paper by Nutter and Manobianco presents results from an objective evaluation of the Meso Eta Model at three selected locations during the 1996 and 1997 warm and cool seasons. The overall evaluation is designed to assess the utility of the model for operational weather forecasting by the U.S. Air Force 45th Weather Squadron, National Weather Service (NWS) Spaceflight Meteorology Group, and NWS Office in Melbourne, Florida. In the subjective verification, limited case studies are used to highlight model capabilities and limitations in forecasting convective activity, the location and movement of cold fronts, and the onset of sea breezes over regions including east-central Florida. In addition, contingency tables and categorical scores are used to verify the occurrence of these phenomena throughout the season. Results from the subjective verification demonstrate that-model forecasts of developing weather events such as thunderstorms, sea breezes, and cold fronts are not always as accurate as might otherwise be implied by the seasonally averaged error statistics. Although the objective statistics do not indicate whether the model provides more accurate forecast guidance on average during either the warm or cool seasons, results from the subjective verification suggest that model forecasts over central Florida may be more useful during the cool season. This is because the Meso Eta Model resolution is not yet sufficient to resolve the small-scale details of sea and river/lake breeze circulations, thunderstorm outflow boundaries, and other phenomena, which play a dominant role in determining the short-term evolution of weather over east-central Florida during the warm season. Lessons learned from the subjective portion of the Meso Eta evaluation should apply equally as well to the recently upgraded "early" Eta Model running with a similar 32-km horizontal resolution.																			0882-8156					FEB	1999	14	1					18	37		10.1175/1520-0434(1999)014<0018:EOTKEM>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0434(1999)014<0018:EOTKEM>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000078688500002

G. lavareti was found on Coregonus lavaretus (L.) in Lake Ottsjon (Jamtland, 1955) and the unidentified species (one specimen only) on Thymallus thymallus (L.) in Lake Satisjaure (Lappland, 1971). Gyrodactylus salaris was found on Salmo salar L. in two northern rivers (in one of them only on migrating smolts) and in one southern river in the Baltic region (nine rivers investigated), and in two river systems in the Atlantic region (eight rivers investigated). G. derjavini was found on Salmo trutta in three rivers in each region. Our results from Swedish fish farms are: G. salaris was found in five out of 12 farms in the Baltic region and two of six farms in the Atlantic region; G. derjavini was found in two of 12 farms in the Baltic region and one of six farms in the Atlantic region. Thus, in natural waters as well as in fish farms, G. salaris and G. derjavini seem to have an uneven distribution. Apart from the limited number of investigations, this may be due to geographic distribution of the species, anthropochoric spreading, macroenvironment (type of waters, other physical parameters), seasonal variations, or life cycle dependent variations of infestation intensity. The absence of G. derjavini in rivers north of the Dalalven may depend on the geographical distribution. Migrating smolts of S. salar (three rivers) and precocious males (one river) seem to be infected more than smaller salmon. Fish farm (or 'culturing') dependent changes in Gyrodactylus species populations (genetic drift) are possible. G. salaris and G. derjavini are secondarily adapted to parasitism on Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum), which may lead to a spread to new areas and problems in fish farms. Taxonomically, G. salaris and.probably G. derjavini also, cause problems. For example, are G. salaris and Gyrodactylus thymalli Zitnan, 1960 really different species, and how large is the range of variation in G. salaris and G. derjavini? With regard to similar species, complementary morphometric, experimental infection investigations and electrophoretic (DNA) analysis are recommended.																			0165-7836					JUN	1993	17	1-2					59	68		10.1016/0165-7836(93)90007-T	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0165-7836(93)90007-T													WOS:A1993LJ73000006

A Tale of Two Tributaries: Source Delineation of Chloride in a Distressed Watershed (Grand Lake St. Marys, Ohio)	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Various sources of pollution have been assigned as contributing to the Freshwater Salinization Syndrome (FSS), by which water bodies are undergoing concurrent salinization and alkalinization. In many urban areas that receive substantial snowfall, road salt application has been ascribed as the main source of chloride driving the FSS. In rural areas, however, inorganic (e.g. chemical) and organic (e.g. manure) fertilizer applications have been found to be the most important sources of chloride. Herein, we compared daily mean concentrations of chloride over the past decade of time between Coldwater Creek and Chickasaw Creek, two tributaries of Grand Lake St. Marys, the largest reservoir in Ohio. We also used Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season (WRTDS) analyses to visualize trends in chloride data and compared chloride vs. nitrate levels to delineate likely sources of chloride for the two streams. We found that road salt application increased over time in both subwatersheds and that 37% and 25% of the chloride could be apportioned to road salt as a source in Coldwater Creek and Chickasaw Creek, respectively. Additionally, in Coldwater Creek, 37% of the chloride was apportioned to animal or septic sources, while 25% was apportioned to inorganic fertilizers, in comparison with 30% and 42% for Chickasaw Creek. Monitoring and assessing salinized streams for both chemical and biological water quality is important, particularly since the FSS has become increasingly linked to declines in water quality (e.g. harmful algal blooms, including recent upticks in Prymnesium parvum blooms) and is expected to be exacerbated with global climate change (e.g. increased precipitation causing increased runoff of chloride from the land).

This study employed the CMIP6 data and a river ice model to predict global river ice changes in response to climate change. Results indicate significant declines in global river ice due to global warming. With each 1 degrees C increase in surface air temperature (SAT) in the future, river ice extent of ice-affected rivers decrease by 2.11 percentage points, and ice duration shorten by 8.4 days. Under the shared socioeconomic pathways 2-4.5 (SSP2-4.5) scenario, the long-term mean SAT is 1.2 degrees-2.5 degrees C higher than in the near term. This leads to a 1.9-4.4-percentage-point decrease in global river ice extent, a 6.8-15.1-day decrease in river ice duration, and ice-free rivers increasing by up to 4.02%. The SSP5-8.5 scenario predicts a warmer longterm mean SAT, leading to greater reductions in river ice. Geographically, river ice loss is most notable in North America, Europe, Siberia, and the Tibetan Plateau (TIB), particularly in peninsular, coastal, and mountainous regions due to the combined effects of initial temperatures and temperature increases. Overall, the eastern Europe (EEU) shows the greatest loss of river ice on average. Monthly analyses show the most substantial decreases from October to June, indicating pronounced seasonal variability. This study provides valuable insights for addressing challenges related to river ice changes in high-latitude and high-elevation regions.

The CATCH Rainbow program incorporated nutrition education, cooking, and gardening lessons aimed at increasing FV consumption in elementary school-aged children and assessed changes in participants' BMI, self-reported FV consumption, and skin carotenoid levels at baseline and post-intervention. Methods: Two-hundred and twenty-five 4th and 5th graders (mean age: 9.8 years and 52% male participants) at Genoa Elementary School participated in six cooking and six gardening sessions between September 2021 and May 2022. Each nutrition education session was 25 min long, paired with either hands-on cooking activities or gardening skills. At baseline and post-intervention, participants' height and weight were assessed with a stadiometer/scale, and skin carotenoid measurement was taken by a Veggie Meter (R) (Longevity Link Corporation (Salt Lake City, UT, USA)). Students also completed the Block Food Frequency Questionnaire to self-report FV consumption at both time points. Focus groups were conducted with children at the end of the program for qualitative feedback. Results: paired samples T-test and regression analysis results indicate no significant decrease in BMI or significant increase in skin carotenoid scores from pre- to post-intervention. However, though not significant, there was an increase in self-reported FV intake by 0.4 servings. Additionally, the qualitative feedback was positive, as children mentioned benefits of healthy eating and expressed enjoyment for growing, cooking, and tasting fruits and vegetables. Conclusions: Results from this study can be used to guide future cooking and gardening programs for elementary school children. Time of the year when implementing these programs and collecting data may impact study outcomes due to seasonal variations in fruit and vegetable intake.																				2072-6643				OCT	2024	16	19							3283	10.3390/nu16193283	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu16193283								39408250					WOS:001332122000001

Human activities, such as urbanisation, industry, and farming, can increase the amount of nutrients and other elements that reach receiving waterbodies like Lake Victoria in Uganda, which can be problematic at elevated levels. There is therefore a strong need to evaluate recent changes in pollutant concentrations and their potential negative effects. To contribute to this gap and to explore the pollutant changes in Lake Victoria, a series of water chemistry data (phosphate, nitrate, potassium, ammonium, sodium, sulphate, silica and chlorine) was collected between 2016 and 2023 in Uganda's Napoleon Gulf (NG) and Murchison Bay (MB), primarily by the Ministry of Water and Environment (MWE). These locations were chosen based on their vicinity to expanding urban centres and agriculture, and they are also areas where fishing frequently occurs. The datasets were collected at different water depths (0.5-24 m). Data were analysed with the use of IBM's Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS 28.0) software and confirmed the excessive concentrations of pollutants within MB compared to NG. The analysis identified the different nutrient types that exceeded internationally recognised thresholds relating to acceptable water quality during the data collection period. Seasonal variations were observed, during the dry season; nutrient levels, however, in NG showed higher nutrient concentrations during the wet season. The study's capacity to inform local authorities and policymakers about such potential major sources of pollution is of crucial importance for beginning to address the potential impacts on human health and aquatic life.					; Kennedy, Michael/CAF-8654-2022	Rubinato, Matteo/0000-0002-8446-4448; Kennedy, Michael/0000-0003-4936-6487; 														2071-1050				OCT	2024	16	20							9128	10.3390/su16209128	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su16209128													WOS:001341558800001

Determining Thresholds for Conservation of Vernal Pools	WETLANDS												Vernal pools-small seasonal wetlands-provide critical breeding habitat for many species but are under-protected in environmental regulation. Because vernal pools are not rare in the northeastern United States, regulatory emphasis is typically placed on protecting "significant" vernal pools yet scientific criteria for determining thresholds for conservation significance remain poorly developed. We used an evidence-based approach to identify thresholds of pool significance based on populations of breeding amphibians in five ecoregions and across urbanization gradients of New York State, where a recent revision to wetland law allows regulation based on amphibian productivity. We combined existing population survey data with new surveys to yield a dataset of 587 pools for estimating statistical distributions of productivity of two indicator species: spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) and wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus). Spotted salamander egg mass counts were significantly lower in highly developed landscapes. Larger pools were generally more productive for both species yet no single habitat feature reliably predicted high egg mass counts. Pool incidence and productivity also varied regionally: the Hudson-Mohawk region hosted the most known vernal pools and highest egg mass counts and the Lake Plain region the fewest known pools. Our dataset yielded threshold options for guiding pool protection that varied by the proportion of pools targeted. We suggest a lower standard for protecting pools in high-development areas and that presence of other pool-breeding indicator species could also qualify pools for significance. These recommendations can guide regulators in affording protection critical to small wetland habitats specific to regional and landscape contexts.

Use of capture-recapture models to evaluate abundance and dynamics of a stocked Muskellunge population	AQUACULTURE, FISH AND FISHERIES												To evaluate the success of a stocking program in Fox Lake, Minnesota, adult (>= 76 cm total length) Muskellunge were captured with large nearshore trap nets and individually marked with passive integrated transponder tags during the 2011-2013 and 2015-2017 spawning seasons; then, capture-recapture data were analyzed at two different time scales. Despite substantial sampling effort, daily capture histories within a single season only supported closed-population abundance estimates for both sexes in half the years; estimates were imprecise, and there was evidence of trap shyness or violation of the short-term closure assumption in some years. Jolly-Seber models over all years supported relatively precise abundance estimates for both sexes every year, as well as estimates of annual survival, recruitment, and population growth rate. Link-Barker Jolly-Seber models provided estimates of population growth rate lambda approximate to 1 indicating that per-capita annual recruitment rates of only about 0.15-0.20 were adequate to maintain the adult population given the high annual apparent survival rates of 0.80 for adult females and 0.89 for adult males. POPAN Jolly-Seber models revealed that about 80 adult females and 90-126 adult males were vulnerable to capture each year in the 385 ha lake, and about 16-18 fish of each sex recruited to the adult population annually. This study illustrates the importance of open-population models with multiple years of data to evaluate the abundance and population dynamics of a low-density, long-lived species.																			2693-8847					OCT	2024	4	5							e203	10.1002/aff2.203	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aff2.203													WOS:001303315600001

This study selected three of the most common paddy soils in subtropical China, developing from quaternary red soil (R), lake sediment sand (S), and alluvial soil (C), to study their total N2O consumption and total nitrogen (N-2) production using N-2-free microcosm experiments. These paddy soils were treated with N2O addition (N2O treatment) or helium (He) addition (CK treatment) and incubated under flooding and anoxic conditions. The results showed that three alluvial soils (C1, C2, and C3) consumed over 99.93% of the N2O accumulated in the soil profile, significantly higher than R and S soils (p < 0.05). And the N-2 production in three C soils was also significantly higher than other soils, accounting for 81.61% of the total N2O consumption. The main soil factors affecting N2O consumption in C, S, and R soils were soil clay content (p < 0.05), soil sand content (R-2 = 0.95, p < 0.001), and soil available potassium (AK) (p < 0.01), respectively. These results indicate flooding paddy soils, no matter the parent materials developed, could consume extremely large amount of N2O produced in soil profiles.																				2073-445X				OCT	2024	13	10							1710	10.3390/land13101710	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land13101710													WOS:001344555700001

Study focus: Water provision ability is a pivotal ecological service of high-altitude alpine regions and is controlled by precipitation, evapotranspiration (ET), and soil water storage whereas the underlying ecohydrological processes remain highly unquantified. Here, we investigated continuous 19-year flux measurements to quantify the temporal patterns of ET and water budget (precipitation minus ET, P-ET), as well as 0-20 cm soil water storage change (Delta SWS). New hydrological insights for the region: At a monthly scale, ET peaked in July (96.7 f 26.4 mm, Mean f S.D.) and averaged 41.7 f 31.9 mm, whose variations were determined by the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve at air temperature, air and soil temperatures, regardless of vegetation growth stage. P-ET averaged 18.3 f 26.3 mm in August and September while stayed deficit during the other months. The variations in P-ET were controlled by precipitation in the May-October growing season whereas by ET in the non-growing season from November to April. Delta SWS peaked in May (28.8 f 11.2 mm) and September (3.0 f 2.7 mm) and almost accumulated to zero over the whole season. At annual scales, none of ET, P-ET, and Delta SWS changed significantly. ET averaged 512.2 f 68.4 mm and exceeded precipitation (459.1 f 58.4 mm), likely due to the lateral flow supply of uphill locations. The variations in ET were regulated directly by bulk canopy resistance and indirectly by net radiation. P-ET averaged -53.2 f 95.4 mm and demonstrated a clear water deficit (-51.6 f 21.0 mm) during the non-growing season. The variations of P-ET were driven jointly by precipitation and ET, with opposite but equivalent effects. The dominance of thermal conditions and energy availability on ET variability manifested an energy-limited feature of water loss in the alpine shrubland. The temporal patterns in P-ET elucidated that the alpine shrubland plays the water retention rather than water provision function through transforming variable precipitation input into stable ET loss.

J	RICE, JA; CROWDER, LB; HOLEY, ME				RICE, JA; CROWDER, LB; HOLEY, ME			EXPLORATION OF MECHANISMS REGULATING LARVAL SURVIVAL IN LAKE-MICHIGAN BLOATER - A RECRUITMENT ANALYSIS BASED ON CHARACTERISTICS OF INDIVIDUAL LARVAE	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Estimates of relative egg deposition and larval abundance suggest that events occurring between spawning and the first 1-2 months after hatching play a major role in determining recruitment success of bloater Coregonus %hoyi in Lake Michigan. Although relative egg deposition in 1983 was only 57% of that in 1982, larval recruitment was 2.4 times greater in 1983. We investigated mechanisms governing survival of larval bloaters by comparing characteristics of individual "survivors" through the first 1-2 months of life with those of larvae at earlier life history stages. Otolith analysis was used to identify stress periods and to determine ages, first-feeding dates to nearly 2 months of age in 1982 and 1983. Differences between the observed distribution of first-feeding dates for newly hatched larvae and the expected distribution predicted from egg deposition showed that eggs spawned early experienced higher mortality during the incubation period than did eggs spawned later. Eggs spawned early took about 2.5 weeks longer to develop than eggs spawned later because they incubated at cooler temperatures; this prolonged exposure to mortality sources may account for the observed difference in survival. Differences between the distributions of first-feeding dates for newly hatched larvae and larvae about 1 month old also suggested that early hatching larvae experienced higher initial mortality than late-hatching larvae. Starvation was not an important cause of mortality; growth rates of all larvae collected in the field were as high as or higher than those of larvae reared in the laboratory and fed ad libitum. Larvae hatching early in the season, however, grew only about half as fast during their first 3 weeks as larvae hatched later. These early hatching, slower-growing larvae were also more likely to exhibit stress marks in the otolith ring pattern during their first 2 weeks, marks that were similar to those caused in the laboratory by short periods of starvation or low ration. Lower growth rates and higher frequency of stress markers for larvae during the period of higher relative mortality suggest that size or grown-rate-dependent mortality (e.g., predation) during the first few weeks of life may be an important mechanism affecting bloater recruitment.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				SEP	1987	116	5					703	718		10.1577/1548-8659(1987)116<703:EOMRLS>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1987)116<703:EOMRLS>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1987N781700003

Water samples were collected from six different sites, and these samples were analyzed for total coliform (TC), fecal coliforms (FC), and Escherichia coli (E.coli) content. Additionally, potential of hydrogen (pH), dissolved oxygen (DO), total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC), and Secchi depth were measured. Nutrients and heavy metals were determined using standard methods. The abundance of phytoplankton was estimated by calculating the biovolume of the species using appropriate geometric shapes. The results indicated that the pH, TDS, DO, and turbidity ranged from 8.78 +/- 0.31 to 9.52 +/- 0.04, 129 +/- 4 to 419 +/- 3 ppm, 5.50 to 7.25 mg/l, and 0.96 to 17.29 NTU, respectively. TC bacteria exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) standards at all sampling sites, while FC levels exceeded the standards in most sites. Cadmium and chromium were below detectable levels in both seasons, whereas lead in the dry season exceeded the WHO limits. The levels of iron were high across all sites in the dry season and low in most sites in the wet season. Five major taxonomic groups of phytoplankton were also identified, comprising a total of 32 species. Among these, green algae, blue-green algae, and diatoms had the highest species richness, whereas dinoflagellates and cryptomonads accounted for less than 25% of the total phytoplankton diversity. HIGHLIGHTS Water quality, phytoplankton biomass, and species composition and abundance were investigated. Total coliform, fecal coliforms, and E.coli in the lake exceed WHO standards. Iron and lead levels in the dry season exceed WHO standards. Chlorophyll-a level varied in the range 20.00-29.99 mu g/l and the lake is classified as fully eutrophic. The abundance and diversity of phytoplankton were influenced by environmental factors.

Seasonal dietary changes of the year-classes were considered comparing the monthly fluctuations in abundance of major prey organisms. Though these bluegills are dietary generalists and opportunists like those in North America, their foraging pattern was characterized by a relatively clearer dietary shift during ontogeny and a wider food niche including piscivorous than those of bluegills with congeners in their home land. Therefore this finding provides evidence of the ecological release caused by the absence of congeners.																			0018-8158					OCT 2	1992	243						269	276		10.1007/BF00007042	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007042													WOS:A1992JZ96300028
J	Gosselin, DC; Khisty, MJ				Gosselin, DC; Khisty, MJ			Simulating the influence of two shallow, flow-through lakes on a groundwater system: implications for groundwater mounds and hinge lines	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Groundwater mounds and hinge lines are important features related to the interaction of groundwater and takes. In contrast to the transient formation of groundwater mounds, numerical simulations indicate that permanent groundwater mounds form between closely spaced lakes as the natural consequence of adding two net sinks to a groundwater flow system. The location of the groundwater mound and the position of the hinge lines between the two lakes are intimately related. As the position of the mound changes there is a corresponding shift in the position of the hinge line. This results in a change in the ratio of groundwater inflow to outflow (Q(i)/Q(o)) for the lake. The response of the lake is an increase or decrease in the take level. Our simulations indicate that the movement of the hinge line in a natural system is a consequence of the dynamic interrelationships between recharge, the slope of the water table upgradient and downgradient of the lake, and the loss of water from the lake by evaporation. The extent of the seasonal movement of the hinge line will vary from one year to the next depending on local changes in the magnitude of the hydrologic variables.																			1431-2174	1435-0157				OCT	2001	9	5					476	486		10.1007/s100400100144	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s100400100144													WOS:000171831900006

No trophic upsurge occurred in the reservoir as has been found in most of the newly hooded reservoirs. Phytoplankton composition changed drastically from 1996 to 1997, the latter year being characterized by a rarity of diatoms. Areal euphotic chlorophyll a concentration and phytoplankton carbon biomass were typical of mesotrophic lakes in 1996 and of somewhat oligotrophic environments in 1997. In contrast, the primary production (PP) rates were similar in both years, indicating a change in the factors controlling phytoplankton populations from 1996 to 1997. The low PP (compared with the algal biomass present) in 1996 seemed to be related to the instability of the water column and the Z(mix):Z(eu) ratio, whose negative effects on the phytoplankton community were apparently more pronounced in 1996 than in 1997. Orthophosphate concentrations, and their contribution to total phosphorus, remained low in 1996 but increased with time in 1997. The temporal losses of orthophosphates from June to September 1996 accounted for only 42% of the measured PP, indicating that Pf in 1996 was also strongly affected by P availability and probably took place due to other P sources such as regenerated nutrients.					; Sime-Ngando, Télesphore/M-4134-2019	Sime-Ngando, Telesphore/0000-0002-7240-5803; 													0142-7873					JUL	2000	22	7					1355	1375		10.1093/plankt/22.7.1355	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/22.7.1355													WOS:000088389100009
J	HANSON, JM				HANSON, JM			MACROINVERTEBRATE SIZE-DISTRIBUTIONS OF 2 CONTRASTING FRESH-WATER MACROPHYTE COMMUNITIES	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Macroinvertebrates (> 0.1 mg, fresh weight) were collected every 2 weeks for 18 weeks from weedbeds dominated by either the macroalga Chara or rooted plants (mostly Isoetes sp., Potamogeton filiformis, Nuphar variegatum and Myriophyllum exalbescens) in Narrow Lake, Alberta, Canada. Significant differences in total biomass, taxonomic composition, and size-structure of the macroinvertebrate community were found between the two weedbed types. 2. Total biomass of macroinvertebrates in the Chara beds (seasonal mean 26.4 g m-2) was consistently higher than in the rooted-plant weedbeds (seasonal mean 7.6 g m-2). 3. The macroinvertebrate community of the Chara beds was dominated by chironomids, anisopterans, gastropods and sphaerid clams whereas amphipods dominated the community in the rooted-plant weedbeds. 4. On average, the proportion of total biomass in the various size-classes (biomass size-spectrum) of the macroinvertebrate community in Chara beds varied very little between 1 and 512 mg. In rooted plant weedbeds, the spectrum showed a strong peak in the 4-8 mg size-class, a weak peak in the 32-64 mg size-class, and proportionately low biomass in the 128-256 mg and 256-512 mg size-classes. The slope of the normalized size-spectrum for the macroinvertebrate community of the Chara beds (-0.89) was significantly different from that of the rooted plant community (-1.11). The biomass of large organisms (> 64 mg) was 10 times greater in the Chara beds than in the rooted-plant weedbeds. 5. The species composition of aquatic macrophyte beds can greatly influence the abundance, taxonomic composition, and size-structure of the littoral zone macroinvertebrate community. Therefore, any changes in plant species composition of weedbeds, through introduction of exotic plant species or introduction (or loss) of an efficient grazer (e.g. crayfish), have the potential to alter greatly the structure of the macroinvertebrate community in a lake, with unknown consequences to fish and waterfowl dependent upon these prey.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				DEC	1990	24	3					481	491		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1990.tb00726.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1990.tb00726.x													WOS:A1990ET05300006

Long-term monitoring of water quality and phytoplankton community structure of Lake Manzala, Mediterranean Coast of Egypt	SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN												Coastal wetlands play a crucial role in supporting biodiversity, providing valuable ecosystem services, and contributing to the resilience of coastal ecosystems, making the preservation and restoration of these wetlands essential for sustainable development in coastal regions. This study focuses on Lake Manzala, a coastal wetland located on the Mediterranean Coast of Egypt, highlighting the significance of conserving and managing this unique environment. The objective of this research was to evaluate the water quality and phytoplankton structure of Lake Manzala and establish an updated long-term ecological database for the region, specifically evaluating the effectiveness of development plans that were carried out in 2017. Surface water samples were collected seasonally at eleven sites between 2010 to 2022. The findings revealed that prior to the development plans, the phytoplankton abundance in Lake Manzala exhibited high levels of eutrophication, characterized by increased abundance and species richness. The dominant phytoplankton classes in Lake Manzala were Bacillariophyceae, Chlorophyceae, and Cyanophyceae. Prior to development plans, they accounted for 46.5% and 45.0% respectively. Post-development, Bacillariophyceae increased to 62.8%, while Chlorophyceae decreased to 25.1%. Dinophyceae increased from 1.3% to 9.04%, while Cyanophyceae decreased from 6.1% to 1.6%. Based on the Trophic State Index for chlorophyll a, Lake Manzala underwent a shift from predominantly hypertrophic to eutrophic conditions. The study explored the relationship between biological factors and environmental conditions using principal component analysis, cluster analysis, and the modified water quality index (WQI). The results indicated positive signs of improvement in Lake Manzala during the post-development phase, as it transitioned from a poor to a moderate state. This research emphasizes the need for integrated land and water management approaches. By informing policy direction and development, this research underscores the importance of preserving and restoring ecosystems for the long-term well-being of both local communities and the global environment.																			2468-2276					DEC	2024	26								e02345	10.1016/j.sciaf.2024.e02345	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sciaf.2024.e02345		SEP 2024											WOS:001322567400001
J	Olaleye, VF				Olaleye, VF			Ichthyofaunal survey of rivers within Ewekoro cement manufacturing operational areas	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												A total of 298 fish specimens belonging to seven families were caught during ichthyoplanktonic survey of three rivers within the Ewekoro cement facility catchment area located in southwestern Nigeria. The highest numbers of specimens were caught from Alaguntan (37.0%) and Elebute (36.6%) rivers while 28.9% of the fish samples were collected from Itori River. The fish population and species diversity recorded in the catchment rivers were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than comparative catches from Ewekoro River located about 30 km downstream of the factory operational area. The food items ingested by the specimens across the seasons in the catchment rivers revealed obvious differences in diet with some degree of overlap in the fish trophic preferences. However, the omnivorous species dominated the catches in each of the rivers, irrespective of season. Categorization of the fish specimens based on habitat-related adaptive physiology showed that a significant number of the fish from Alaguntan and Itori Rivers have accessory respiratory organs. The four species with accessory respiratory organs were Polypterus senegalus Curv., Clarias gariepinus C. & V., Ctenopoma kingslayae Gun. and Channa obscura Smith. Of the 12 fish species recorded in the Ewekoro cement facility catchment rivers, only P. senegalus, C. gariepinus, C. obscura and Oreochromis niloticus (Trew.) are valuable food fishes in southwestern Nigeria.																			0960-3115	1572-9710				AUG	2005	14	9					2171	2184		10.1007/s10531-004-4668-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-004-4668-y													WOS:000230565100008
J	Walker, SE; Ayres, JM				Walker, SE; Ayres, JM			Positional behavior of the white uakari (Cacajao calvus calvus)	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY												The positional behavior and habitat use of a group of white uakaries (Cacajao calvus calvus) was observed for 6 weeks in the dry season at Lake Teiu, Brazil. Data are presented for feeding, traveling, and resting activities. The most common feeding posture is sit, followed by stand. Cacajao frequently exhibits locomotor behaviors while in feeding trees, using pronograde clamber and quadrupedal walk. The most frequently used locomotor behaviors in travel are quadrupedal walk, leap, and pronograde clamber. Quadrupedal run and drop also figure importantly in the behavioral repertoire. The most frequent resting posture was sit, followed by ventral lie. Compared to representative members of the other pitheciin genera, Pithecia and Chiropotes, Cacajao engages in more locomotion while feeding, and uses more pedal suspension. While traveling, pronograde clamber and drop are more frequently used by Cacajao. Multiple, deformable supports are used more by Cacajao than by the other pitheciins throughout all activities. Overall, the positional behavior of Cacajao is more similar to that of Chiropotes than of Pithecia. Cacajao's behavioral solutions to the problems of balance imposed by its greatly reduced tail are discussed.

A study at Lake Tana Biosphere, from December 2020 to December 2021, aimed to understand their breeding biology, which had not been previously documented. We conducted intensive searches for nests and monitored them during incubation and post-hatching to assess reproductive success. The study found pelicans breed year-round, with peaks from late December to March and June to July. The average clutch size was 2.14, with egg dimensions averaging 90.33 mm in length and 58.70 mm in breadth and a mean weight of 173.68 g. No significant differences were observed in these measurements, but a positive correlation was found between egg length, weight, and breadth and weight. However, no correlation existed between length and breadth. Out of 98 eggs, 84 hatched, resulting in 80 and 91.5 % hatchability rates across two breeding seasons, averaging 85.71 %. The hatching success rate did not differ significantly between seasons. Unfortunately, only 37 pelicans reached the pre-fledging stage, indicating a high mortality rate of 63 %. The study concluded that the breeding performance of Great White Pelicans at Lake Tana is poor, with human disturbance, overfishing, and predation on nestlings posing significant threats to their nesting success. This highlights the need for conservation efforts to address these challenges and protect the species.

J	Shahariar, S; Soolanayakanahally, R; Bedard-Haughn, A				Shahariar, Shayeb; Soolanayakanahally, Raju; Bedard-Haughn, Angela			Groundwater table prediction and seasonal variation influenced by short rotation willow plantation on marginal riparian lands of the Prairie potholes in Canada	GEODERMA REGIONAL												Shallow groundwater consumption via phreatophytic transpiration and resulting vegetation-linked groundwater table (GWT) fluctuation is a typical soil hydrological process in wetland riparian areas. However, upland and riparian land use alterations may further influence the shallow GWT fluctuation, temporally and spatially. In this multi-year field study, we investigated whether introducing short rotation willow (SRW) positively or negatively affects the shallow GWT, soil water availability, and soil health on marginal riparian lands of the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR). We compared the impact of SRW on these parameters to two common land uses: annual crop (AC) and pasture (PA). Depth to GWT was monitored via data loggers from 28 wells in two semi-arid PPR sites. The GWT depth varied by land use practices only in site B (p < 0.001; PA > SRW = AC) but not significantly in site A (p = 0.325), and the patterns were inconsistent between sites. In GWT depth prediction, the performance of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was better than Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models but was inconsistent alike with field observations. The GWT depth responded to seasonal precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (ET) patterns. The monthly GWT fluctuations peaked between June and August due to increased precipitation, while they were lower during May and September with reduced precipitation; however, these variations were not significant (p > 0.05). Higher precipitation and lower potential ET throughout the wet year (i.e., in 2014) significantly (p < 0.05) raised GWT (i.e., decreased depth to GWT) under all land uses, and vice versa. Our study indicated that planting SRW in marginal riparian land of the PPR would not negatively impact shallow GWT or soil water availability. Moreover, the SRW plantation could also help manage soil salinity without severely depleting the soil's nutrient pools or diminishing soil quality and health indicator parameters measured during the first rotation.

Critical periods of Lipid energy transfer from phyto-to zooplankton were inferred by comparing seasonal patterns of particulate and dissolved lipid fractions in lake water with temporal changes in Lipid energy reserves of the zooplankton in a hypereutrophic lake. 2. The midsummer phytoplankton community was dominated by the bloom-forming cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. The collapse of the bloom was accompanied by a 2-week period of severe nitrogen deficiency after which there was a marked increase in the concentration of lipid energy reserves in the particulate (algal) fraction. 3. Areal lipid energy reserves of the dominant herbivorous zooplankton responded positively to changes in the tri- and diacylglycerol content of the particulate fraction of lake water in a species-specific manner. 4. Bacterial numbers also peaked in September concomitant with a large increase in free fatty acids in the dissolved lipid fraction probably produced by the decay of the A. flos-aquae bloom. 5. The association between periods of nitrogen deficiency and increased energy reserve lipids in the particulate fraction supports observations made with laboratory algal cultures that periods of nutrient deficiency may intensify lipid synthesis in some algal species, thereby enhancing the rate of lipid energy transfer from phytoplankton to zooplankton.					; Arts, Michael/H-4973-2012; Evans, Marlene/NQC-4422-2025	Evans, Marlene/0000-0002-8869-1162; Arts, Michael/0000-0002-2335-4317; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				DEC	1997	38	3					525	537		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1997.00218.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1997.00218.x													WOS:000071561200007
J	DELGIORGIO, PA				DELGIORGIO, PA			THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ETS (ELECTRON-TRANSPORT SYSTEM) ACTIVITY AND OXYGEN-CONSUMPTION IN LAKE PLANKTON - A CROSS-SYSTEM CALIBRATION	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The ETS (electron transport system) assay to measure respiration of aquatic organisms has been widely applied in studies of marine metabolism, but its use in freshwaters has been much more limited. This method calculates oxygen consumption from the measured ETS activity using an empirical conversion factor. This factor has been calculated for various marine organisms, and for natural plankton communities, but calibrations for freshwater organisms are lacking. The aim of this paper was to determine the relationship between lake plankton respiration and ETS activity, based on measured epilimnetic plankton oxygen uptake and ETS activity in 20 southern Quebec lakes. The relationship between plankton oxygen consumption and ETS varies significantly both within lakes over the growing season, and among lakes. The magnitude of the error associated with calculating respiration from ETS is, however, similar to the error in other standard limnological procedures used in plankton carbon flow studies. Oxygen consumption is not a linear function of ETS across the range of lakes, but is rather a power function. The respiration:ETS ratio for lake plankton is therefore not constant: it is high in oligotrophic and colored lakes, and declines with trophy. These results are consistent with the changes expected in the structure of the plankton along trophic gradients.					del Giorgio, Paul/AAD-1315-2019	del Giorgio, Paul/0000-0003-1866-8159													0142-7873					DEC	1992	14	12					1723	1741																WOS:A1992KE98900006

The larvae that received fish-conditioned water underwent a significantly greater intensity of migration than did those that received fish-free water. Results support the hypothesis that Chaoborus larvae alter their vertical migration behavior in response to the presence of planktivorous fish, in particular, to associated chemical cues. Their behavioral flexibility in migrating permits response to a patchy environment that is variable both seasonally and between habitats.																			0024-3590					NOV	1990	35	7					1456	1468		10.4319/lo.1990.35.7.1456	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1990.35.7.1456													WOS:A1990EX80500004
J	Wang, F; Tian, SY; Yan, WJ				Wang, Fang; Tian, Siyu; Yan, Weijin			Unveiling the temporal variability of gas transfer coefficients of streams based on high-frequency dissolved oxygen measurements	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from streams and rivers are important sources of global GHG emissions. As a crucial parameter for estimating GHG emissions, the gas transfer coefficient (expressed as K-600 at water temperature of 20 degrees C) has uncertainties. This study proposed a new approach for estimating K-600 based on high-frequency dissolved oxygen (DO) data and an ecosystem metabolism model. This approach combines the numerical solution method with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis. This study was conducted in the Chaohu Lake watershed in Southeastern China, using high-frequency data collected from six streams from 2021 to 2023. This study found: (1) The numerical solution of K-600 demonstrated distinct dynamic variability for all streams, ranging from 0 to 111.39 cm h(-1) (2) Streams with higher discharge (>10 m(3) s(-1)) exhibited significant seasonal differences in K-600 values. The monthly average discharge and water temperature were the two factors that determined the variation in K-600 values. (3) K-600 was a major source of uncertainty in CO2 emission fluxes, with a relative contribution of 53.72%. An integrated K-600 model of riverine gas exchange was developed at the watershed scale and validated using the observed DO change. Our study stressed that K-600 dynamics can better represent areal change to reduce uncertainty in estimating GHG emissions.					; Tian, Siyu/KLD-1030-2024; Yan, Weijin/J-6708-2019; Wang, Fang/B-1923-2016	Yan, Weijin/0000-0002-9660-4436; 													0013-9351	1096-0953				DEC 1	2024	262		2						119939	10.1016/j.envres.2024.119939	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2024.119939		SEP 2024						39243842					WOS:001319158700001

Geometric mean egg counts in the pure S. mansoni and pure S. haematobium infections were 97.7 eggs/g faeces and 12.9 eggs/10 ml urine, respectively. There were marked differences in levels of endemicity between provinces and also between schools within each province. School-specific prevalences and intensities of infection were positively correlated, both for S. mansoni and for S. haematobium. Prevalences and intensities of infection were generally similar in male and female subjects and in the different age groups into which they were split (i.e. 5-9, 10-14 and 15-19 years). Community-based surveys of all age groups in two villages showed typical patterns of infections with S. mansoni and S. haematobium, with indices peaking in those aged 10-19 years, both in males and females. Observations on snail-related aspects of transmission revealed that transmission of both S. mansoni and S. haematobium was highly focal and also seasonal, taking place during the hot, dry and post-rainy seasons.																			0003-4983					APR	1996	90	2					173	180		10.1080/00034983.1996.11813041	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00034983.1996.11813041								8762407					WOS:A1996UG28200008

METHANE EMISSIONS FROM THE AMAZON FLOODPLAIN: CHARACTERIZATION OF PRODUCTION AND TRANSPORT	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Methane production, transport and emission in a floodplain lake in central Amazonia were investigated by isotopic studies and gas exchange measurements. Samples of sediment free gas were depleted in (delta C-13(CH4), delta C-13(CH4), and Omega C-13(CO2) values. Theisotopic composition o the sediment free methane clearly demonstrated a methane production by methyl fermentation. This finding was strengthened by the coexisting delta C-13(CO2) and delta C-13(CO2), values in the sediment free gas: The flux rates of methane ebullition and diffusion were measured during a complete annual cycle using the static chamber method. Significant differences were observed in the release of methane from individual vegetation types, i.e., phytoplankton, floating grass mats, and flooded forest. Each vegetation type showed a distinct seasonal pattern. The highest ebullition rates (mean value, 69 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) were recorded in the flooded forest, covering the higher areas of the floodplains with a long subaerial period. Significantly lower averages of the gas bubble flux were recorded in the permanently aquatic areas of the lake (mean value, 29 mg CH4 m(-1) d(-1)) and in the intermediate area with floating grass mats (mean value, 23 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)). Ebullition was the predominant mechanism for the methane transport from the varzea sediment into the atmosphere with maximum values of up to 200 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1). The diffusive flux remained below 29 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) at all sites throughout the entire annual cycle. The variation of the ebullutive flux was found to determine the spatial and temporal variation of the total methane flux in the varzea. We estimate that ebullition accounts for 80% of the total methane emission from the varzea.					; Junk, Wolfgang/A-6172-2017; Rennenberg, Heinz/A-2083-2013	Rennenberg, Heinz/0000-0001-6224-2927; 													0886-6236	1944-9224				MAR	1992	6	1					3	13		10.1029/91GB01767	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/91GB01767													WOS:000211487700002

The content of minor fluorescent nutrients is investigated. To this end, fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) of 46 AP samples are recorded in aqueous solution. Synchronous fluorescence (SF) spectra are extracted from these EEMs and their important features are compared to those of PARAFAC methods. Synchronous fluorescence scanning allows different AP samples to be characterized in a single scan. The SF and PARAFAC methods yielded two groups of fluorescent compounds; the first group, consisting of vitamin-like molecules, shows excitation/emission (ex/em) peaks at 340/460, 390/462, 370/440 and 450/526 nm, attributed to caffeic acid, vitamin K, E and riboflavins respectively, while the second group, consisting of pigments, shows ex/em peaks at 610/654, 590/630 and 570/644 nm, attributed to phycocyanins, C-phycocyanin and allophycocyanin. Our fluorescence data showed that while both vitamins and pigments are present in AP during the rainy season, only fluorescent components of vitamin like compounds are present during the dry season. PCA methods allowed classifying different AP samples according to their geographic origin and harvesting season. Fluorescence spectroscopy therefore appears to be a powerful technique for rapidly assessing the chemical composition of AP .																			1386-1425	1873-3557				JAN 15	2025	325								125076	10.1016/j.saa.2024.125076	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.saa.2024.125076		SEP 2024						39236572					WOS:001308233500001

However, due to the limited temporal resolution of current altimetry satellites, obtaining high-frequency, high-precision elevation data for water bodies remains challenging. Consequently, most studies utilize elevation-area (E-A) models constructed from historical elevation and area records, integrated with area observations from high-temporal resolution optical satellites to infer precise water levels. Yet, the construction of the E-A model often assumes a uniform water level across the lake, thus overlooking potential segmentation during dry periods. To address this, our study implemented a zone-based approach, utilizing hydrological connectivity principles to ensure that elevation data within E-A models are confined to appropriate zonal regions. This method effectively minimized uncertainties by preventing errors from zonal discrepancies, significantly improving accuracy compared to traditional methods. It reduced root mean square errors (RMSE) by 0.71-1.73 m during the dry season, achieving RMSEs of 0.35, 0.64, and 0.37 m across three segments. Furthermore, this method ensures water level data are confined to specific zones, preventing the inconsistencies typically caused by averaging data across multiple stations or selecting data from varying elevations. This consistent domain definition reduces extrapolation errors during the model prediction and inversion. Moreover, the method compensates for time information losses often incurred by relying on multi-year percentile charts, thereby enabling more precise aquatic boundary delineation than traditional regional boundaries.					; Fan, Mei-Yi/AAI-5663-2021	Li, Yao/0000-0001-8745-191X; 													1748-9326					SEP 1	2024	19	9							094021	10.1088/1748-9326/ad6620	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad6620													WOS:001284479600001
J	Fojutowski, M				Fojutowski, Michal			Lake Sediments as Microplastic Sink: The Case of Three Lakes from Northern and Central Poland	QUAESTIONES GEOGRAPHICAE												Microplastic (MP) concentrations were determined in surface samples of bottom sediments collected from three lakes in northern and central Poland, located in catchments with low direct anthropopressure. Between 4 MP and 21 MP particles per kilogram of wet sediment were identified in the lakes studied. These values are small compared to those found in lakes located in urbanised areas and other aquatic environments, but important from the point of view of the threat to local freshwater ecosystems. The differences in the number of MP particles in the three examined lakes are a result of the way their nearest environments are used. Lake Czechowskie, the richest in MP particles found, is partially surrounded by pastures and arable lands, while some of the areas lying by are also seasonally used for recreation. In contrast, Lakes G & lstrok;& eogon;boczek and Go & sacute;ci & aogon;& zdot;, both completely surrounded by forests, show significantly less MP pollution. The sources of MP in these lakes are primarily attributed to atmospheric transport. A correlation was made between the deepest detected MP particles (ranging from 25 cm to 60 cm) and the rate of sedimentation in the lakes, calculated based on the average annual deposition in sediment traps. Based on this, the attempt was made to determine the exact year of the deepest identified MP particles. The results obtained for each lake - the year 1901 for Lake Czechowskie, 1963 for Lake G & lstrok;& eogon;boczek and 1986 for Lake Go & sacute;ci & aogon;& zdot; - were interpreted in terms of the sources of MP origin.

THROUGH FIRE, AND THROUGH WATER, AN ABUNDANCE OF MID-DEVONIAN CHARCOAL	PALAIOS												Evidence of fire in the Middle Devonian remains globally scarce. Charcoalified mesofossils recovered from the Emsian-Eifelian Trout Valley and St. Froid Lake formations of Maine are direct evidence of wildfires proximal to the Acadian Orogen, formed as the Avalon terrane and the North American plate collided. These mesofossils include charred psilophytes, lycopsids, prototaxodioids, enigmatic taxa such as Spongiophyton, and coprolites. Here, fire combusted a senesced and partially decayed litter, and the intimately associated nematophytes, following a period of extended dryness. We envisage wildfires occurred during neap tide when exposure of the flora of this estuarine setting was prolonged. Herein we provide a reconstruction of this Middle Devonian landscape and its flora in which lightning generated by post-dry season storms ignited wildfires that propagated through an extensive psilophyte-dominated litter.																			0883-1351	1938-5323				SEP	2024	39	9					301	322		10.2110/palo.2024.009	http://dx.doi.org/10.2110/palo.2024.009													WOS:001340104500001

At the center of the area lies the Lagoa Santa Karst Environmental Protection Area (LSKEPA), located near the Minas Gerais' state capital, Belo Horizonte, and presents a series of lakes associated with the large fluvial system of the Velhas river under the influence, locally, of carbonate rocks. The hydrodynamics of carbonate lakes remain enigmatic, and various factors can influence the behavior of these water bodies. This work analyzed the hydrological behavior of 129 lakes within the LSKEPA to understand potential connections with the main karst aquifer, karst-fissure aquifer, and porous aquifer, as well as their evolution patterns in the physical environment. Pluviometric surveys and satellite image analysis were conducted from 1984 to 2020 to observe how the lakes' shorelines behaved in response to meteorological variations. The temporal assessment for understanding landscape evolution proves to be an effective tool and provides important information about the interaction between groundwater and surface water. The 129 lakes were grouped into eight classes representing the hydrological connection patterns with the aquifers in the region, with classes defined for perennial lakes: (1) constantly connected, (2) seasonally disconnected, and (3) disconnected; for intermittent lakes: (4) disconnected during the analyzed time interval, (5) seasonally connected, (6) disconnected, (7) extremely disconnected, and (8) intermittent lakes that connected and stopped drying up. The patterns observed in the variation of lakes' shorelines under the influence of different pluviometric moments showed a positive correlation, especially in dry periods, where these water bodies may be functioning as recharge or discharge zones of the karst aquifer. These inputs and outputs are conditioned to the well-developed karst tertiary porosity, where water flow in the epikarst moves according to the direction of enlarged karstified fractures, rock foliation planes, and lithological contacts. Other factors may condition the hydrological behavior of the lakes, such as rates of evapotranspiration, intensity of rainfall during rainy periods, and excessive exploitation of water.

Approximation of ice phenology of Maine lakes using Aqua MODIS surface temperature data	ECOSPHERE												Studies of lake ice phenology have historically relied on limited in situ data. Relatively few observations exist for ice out and fewer still for ice in, both of which are necessary to determine the temporal extent of ice cover. Satellite data provide an opportunity to better document patterns of ice phenology across landscapes and relate them to the climatological drivers behind changing ice phenology. We developed a model, the Cumulative Sum Method (CSM), that uses daytime and nighttime surface temperature observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on board the Earth-observing Aqua satellite to approximate ice in (the onset of ice cover) and ice out from training datasets of 13 and 58 Maine lakes, respectively, during the 2002/2003 through 2017/2018 ice seasons. Ice in was signaled by reaching a threshold of cumulative negative degrees following the first day of the season below 0 degrees C. Ice out was signaled by reaching a threshold of cumulative positive degrees following the first day of the year above 0 degrees C. The comparison of observed and remotely sensed ice-in dates showed relative agreement with a correlation coefficient of 0.71 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 9.8 days. Ice-out approximations had a correlation coefficient of 0.67 and an MAE of 8.8 days. Lakes smaller in surface area and nearer the Atlantic coast had the greatest error in approximation. Application of the CSM to 20 additional lakes in Maine produced a comparable ice-out MAE of 8.9 days. Ice-out model performance was weaker for the warmest years; there was a larger MAE of 12.0 days when the model was applied to the years 2019-2023 for the original 58 lakes. The development of this model, which utilizes daily satellite data, demonstrates the promise of remote sensing for quantifying ice phenology over short, temporal scales, and wider geographic regions than can be observed in situ, and allows exploration of the influence of surface temperature patterns on the process and timing of ice in and ice out.

It serves not only as a crucial source of drinking water and an ecological resource but also holds significant economic, tourism, and fisheries value. Phytoplankton, a vital component of aquatic ecosystems, plays a critical role in nutrient cycling and maintaining water structure. Its community composition and concentration reflect changes in the aquatic environment, making it an important biological indicator for monitoring ecological conditions. Understanding the impact of water quality on phytoplankton is essential for maintaining ecological balance and ensuring the sustainable use of water resources. This paper focuses on Lake Taihu, with water samples collected in February, May, August, and November from 2011 to 2019. Using quantile regression, a robust statistical analysis tool, the study investigates the heterogeneous effects of water quality on phytoplankton and seasonal variations. The results indicate significant seasonal differences in water quality in Lake Taihu, which substantially influence phytoplankton, showing weakly alkaline characteristics. When phytoplankton concentrations are low, pondus hydrogenii (pH), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), water temperature (WT), and conductivity significantly affect them. At medium concentrations, COD, TP, TN, and WT have significant effects. At high concentrations, transparency and dissolved oxygen (DO) significantly impact phytoplankton, while TP no longer has a significant effect. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers and environmental managers, supporting the prevention and control of harmful algal blooms in Lake Taihu and similar aquatic systems.

Modeling the Effects of Temperature and Limiting Nutrients on the Competition of an Invasive Floating Plant, Pontederia crassipes, with Submersed Vegetation in a Shallow Lake	PLANTS-BASEL												The potential for a non-native plant species to invade a new habitat depends on broadscale factors such as climate, local factors such as nutrient availability, and the biotic community of the habitat into which the plant species is introduced. We developed a spatially explicit model to assess the risk of expansion of a floating invasive aquatic plant species (FAV), the water hyacinth (Pontederia crassipes), an invader in the United States, beyond its present range. Our model used known data on growth rates and competition with a native submersed aquatic macrophyte (SAV). In particular, the model simulated an invasion into a habitat with a mean annual temperature different from its own growth optimum, in which we also simulated seasonal fluctuations in temperature. Twenty different nutrient concentrations and eight different temperature scenarios, with different mean annual amplitudes of seasonal temperature variation around the mean of the invaded habitat, were simulated. In each case, the ability of the water hyacinth to invade and either exclude or coexist with the native vegetation was determined. As the temperature pattern was changed from tropical towards increasingly cooler temperate levels, the competitive advantage shifted from the tropical FAV to the more temperate SAV, with a wide range in which coexistence occurred. High nutrient concentrations allowed the coexistence of FAV, even at cooler annual temperatures. But even at the highest nutrient concentrations in the model, the FAV was unlikely to persist under the current climates of latitudes in the Southeastern United States above that of Northern Alabama. This result may have some implications for where control efforts need to be concentrated.																			2223-7747					SEP	2024	13	18							2621	10.3390/plants13182621	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants13182621								39339596					WOS:001326148000001
J	Tadesse, Z				Tadesse, Z			The nutritional status and digestibility of Oreochromis niloticus L. diet in Lake Langeno, Ethiopia	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The composition, nutrient content and digestibility of the diet of Oreochromis niloticus were studied based on stomach and rectal samples collected monthly between December, 1995, and December, 1996, from Lake Langeno. The diet of O. niloticus was composed of a mixture of algal-based detritus, macrophyte scraps, phytoplankton and silt. Inorganic silt, macrophytes and detritus were more dominant in the diet during the wet than in the dry season. Total organic matter (TOM) in the diet was generally low (413 mg g(-1) d.w.) reflecting the high proportion of inorganic silt in all seasons. Carbohydrates, proteins and lipids were important nutrients and constituted on average about 139, 185 and 57 mg g(-1) d.w., respectively. The levels of all these nutrients varied significantly (ANOVA, P < 0.0001) between months and declined during the wet season. Variation was observed in the ability of the fish to digest and absorb the different components of the food. Protein (41%) was better assimilated than total organic matter (32.7%), carbohydrate (31.7) or lipids (29.8%). The quality of the food expressed as P:E ratio (18.6-28.8 mg KJ(-1)) ranged from inadequate to adequate. The condition factor (CF) of the fish varied significantly between months in males (ANOVA, F=12.99, p < 0.0001) and females (ANOVA, F=14.46, p < 0.0001). It is concluded that the relatively poor condition factor (CF= 1.67) of O. niloticus in Lake Langeno, compared with other Rift Valley Lakes, follows from the low organic matter content and high proportion of inorganic silt in the diet.

J	SOTO, D; HURLBERT, SH				SOTO, D; HURLBERT, SH			LONG-TERM EXPERIMENTS ON CALANOID CYCLOPOID INTERACTIONS	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Zooplankton species composition was manipulated in an 8-mo long series of experiments in outdoor 450-L tanks. The first experimental stage evaluated the impact of cyclopoids (Mesocyclops, Microcyclops, Cyclops) and calanoids (Diaptomus) on each other. The second and third stages evaluated the effects of Daphnia and mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) on the calanoid-cyclopoid interaction. Cyclopoid predation initially caused a 50-70% reduction in calanoid abundance. After a few months, however, cyclopoids caused > 300% increases in calanoid abundance, apparently by preventing calanoid overexploitation of the phytoplankton. The presence of calanoids depressed cyclopoid abundance by up to 70-90%, presumably by diminishing the availability of edible phytoplankton to cyclopoid nauplii and of prey, such as rotifers, to cyclopoid adults. The presence of Daphnia depressed calanoid abundance, probably by reducing the phytoplankton abundance, but did not affect cyclopoid abundance, perhaps because cyclopoid adults could feed on items other than phytoplankters. Coequality (i.e., similarity in abundance) of closely related taxa was in 4 of 5 cases favored by the addition of a more distantly related taxon. Thus the addition of cyclopoids favored the coequality of two Diaptomus species (D. clavipes, D. siciloides), the addition of these Diaptomus species favored the coequality of two cyclopoid genera (Mesocyclops, Microcyclops), and the addition of Daphnia favored coequality of cyclopoids and calanoids and coequality of the two Diaptomus species, but the dominance of Microcyclops over Mesocyclops. Effects of Gambusia included a drastic reduction of Daphnia populations, moderate reduction of calanoid populations, and negligible effects on cyclopoid populations.																			0012-9615					SEP	1991	61	3					245	265		10.2307/2937108	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2937108													WOS:A1991GC04900002

Multi-year climate memory in shallow lake water levels	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Landscape hydrologic memory of meteorological cycles can have an important impact on catchment hydrological responses by propagating clustering of wet or dry conditions into extreme events. The non-linear and hysteretic hydrologic response functions driven by memory are often only studied at shorter temporal scales (event, season) despite larger interannual hydrologic responses evident in some systems. Within the Canadian Boreal, lakes and lake water levels provide an important indicator that can be used to assess the role of landscape memory on catchment hydrological function. Landscape memory has also been hypothesised to control the hydrological dynamics of shallow lake ecosystems that are also important biogeochemically and ecologically. Here we combine measurements of lake water levels in 26 lakes of varying type at varying temporal frequencies within the glaciated sub-humid Boreal Plain, to examine the impact and variability of interdecadal, decadal, multi-year, and intra-annual memory on lake water levels. We show multi-annual hysteresis of precipitation-lake water levels with varied characteristics in space and time. These spatial variations in landscape memory are driven by differences in storage capacities controlled by heterogeneity in glacial landforms, wetland-forest landcover and lake properties. Thus, the propensity for drought years or wet years to persist or accumulate into extreme landscape drying or wetting varies significantly between different lake-landscape characteristics. We show how landscape memory is crucial to project lake water levels by defining spatial variability of the impact of periods of meteorological drought and deluge vital for understanding system sensitivity, duration of recovery and in turn infer resilience on Boreal Plain hydrology.

For fishes, the equilibrium species, those investing into larval survival (large eggs, parental care) rather than into absolute fecundity, are hypothesized to have evolved in stable and predictable environments with high biotic pressure. Human induced nutrient enrichment in many lakes around the world makes them increasingly subjected to perturbations such as anoxia and toxic algal blooms. We hypothesized that eutrophication results in lakes becoming more unstable, unpredictable and less resource-limited, in turn less favorable to equilibrium species. Another hypothesis states that lacustrine environment stability increases with ecosystem size. This study presents the first attempt to compare the two hypotheses in a group of 26 lakes. We found that the population abundance of equilibrium species was negatively related to increasing eutrophication. Long-lived and highly fecund periodic species responded more positively to eutrophication than short lived opportunistic species, with no parental care. This result could be demonstrated by seasonality in primary productivity which favors periodic species, disconnection from the river which prevents good colonist (i.e., opportunistic) species to (re)-establish after perturbation events, and predation by periodic species on opportunistic species. In contrast, we found no support for the ecosystem size hypothesis. Overall, we showed that human driven eutrophication affected species according to their life history strategies, reinforcing the usefulness of life history theory as a framework for assessing fish community response to a large array of human perturbations. More generally, our study emphasizes the importance of species traits to assess, explain, and predict community responses to human and natural perturbations.					deng, wenbo/AAI-3947-2020; FENG, Kai/KIK-8485-2024; Li, Zhongjie/J-1474-2018	Feng, Kai/0000-0001-6072-8763													0048-9697	1879-1026				NOV 15	2024	951								175684	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.175684	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.175684		AUG 2024						39173766					WOS:001312275800001
J	Petriki, O; Bobori, DC				Petriki, Olga; Bobori, Dimitra C.			Underwater succession battles among fish species in a Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												The intrusion of non-native species into freshwater ecosystems can lead to rapid shifts in fish community dynamics, posing significant threats to biodiversity and ecological stability. In this study, we examined the changes in the fish community within the Kerkini Reservoir, a Ramsar Site in Greece, influenced by the establishment of invasive fish species. Through standardized seasonal surveys conducted in 2007-2008 and 2023, we assessed changes in fish species composition, abundance, and functional traits. Our findings revealed a shift in dominance, with invasive species such as Gymnocephalus cernua emerging as key players in the reservoir's fish fauna. Moreover, high numbers of fish specimens and biomass were recorded, highlighting the reservoir's high productivity. However, concerns arise regarding the ecological impacts of invasive species, particularly G. cernua, which exhibits traits associated with ecological disruption and competition with native species. A shift towards the dominance of species with shorter lifespans, smaller sizes and lower trophic levels was observed. In addition, the observed decline in native species abundance, coupled with poor ecological quality assessments, underscores the need for proactive management measures to preserve ecosystem integrity. This study contributes valuable insights into the ecological dynamics of a system considered a biodiversity hotspot. It also highlights the proliferation of invasive fish species as a primary driver and underscores the importance of ongoing monitoring and conservation efforts. However, future research is needed, focusing on further understanding the long-term effects of invasive species establishment and their implications for native fish populations and ecosystem functioning.

Northwest Flow Snow Aspects of Hurricane Sandy	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												In late October 2012, Hurricane Sandy tracked along the eastern U.S. coastline and made landfall over New Jersey after turning sharply northwest and becoming posttropical while interacting with a complex upper-level low pressure system that had brought cold air into the Appalachian region. The cold air, intensified by the extreme low pressure tracking just north of the region, combined with deep moisture and topographically enhanced ascent to produce an unusual and high-impact early season northwest flow snow (NWFS) that has no analog in recent history. This paper investigates the importance of the synoptic-scale pattern, forcing mechanisms, moisture characteristics (content, depth, and likely sources), and low-level winds, as well as the evolution of some of these features compared to more typical NWFS events in the southern Appalachian Mountains. Several other aspects of the Sandy snowfall event are investigated, including low-level stability and mountain wave formation as manifested in vertical profiles and radar observations. The importance to operational forecasters of recognizing and understanding these factors and differences from more common NWFS events is also discussed.					Miller, Douglas/NGS-8628-2025; Perry, L.

Hydrology and sediment loading in a degrading natural lake system in Malaysia	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Hydrology and suspended sediment loading in the catchment of the natural Chini Lake (second largest natural lake in Malaysia) was investigated. Suspended sediment loads and discharge from seven selected feeder rivers were measured over a period of 1 year from January to December 2006. The river water flow rate during the sampling periods was relatively low, ranging from 0.001 to 1.31 m(3)/s or an average of 0.21 m(3)/s. The highest and lowest stream flow discharge rates were recorded from the Gumum and Cenahan River sub-catchment areas, respectively. The amount of sediment load ranged from 0.49 to 166.02 kg/km(2)/day or an average of 30.57 kg/km(2)/day in the study area. The highest sediment load was recorded in the wet season and the lowest in the dry season. Anthropogenic activities have significantly affected the hydrological functions and availability of the suspended sediments, and have thus influenced the variation in sediment output in the study area.																			1866-6280	1866-6299				FEB	2016	75	3							231	10.1007/s12665-015-5006-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-5006-2													WOS:000370241400053

Phosphorus, total ammonia nitrogen and chlorophyll a from fish cages in a tropical lake (Lake Palminhas, Espirito Santo, Brazil)	AQUACULTURE RESEARCH												Cage fish farming in natural and artificial lakes has become increasingly popular in recent years in tropical countries. The most commonly farmed tropical fish species is the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.). The aim of this study was to characterize the concentration of phosphorus, total ammonia nitrogen and chlorophyll a from existing fish farms (FF) in Lake Palminhas, located in Linhares/ES, Brazil. Three transects were drawn from 0 to 500m from each of the four FF (FF1 to FF4) in the lake during six trials (three in the rainy season and three in the dry season). The lake presented a monomictic-hot pattern, with stratification during the rainy season. Dilution of the monitored parameters did not occur sufficient over a distance of up to 500m from the FF. The location of the FF in the lake and the input of N and P were critical to ensure optimal mixing conditions because the worst results was observed for the fish farm (FF1) located on a finger of the lake, where the highest concentrations of total phosphorus and chlorophyll a occurred. It was also noted that there was possible total phosphorus interference between FF3 and FF4. The results of this study demonstrate that Lake Palminhas had a low dilution power, and these findings may inform environmental assessments of cage fish farming in this region, providing instruments that may support environmental control of cage fish farming.

Characterisation of P fractions in the collected material was performed by a sequential extraction procedure. Sedimentation rates exhibited a distinct seasonal pattern, that allowed us to differentiate three periods: (1) a biogenic sedimentation period (BS), in which the sedimentation rates and total suspended matter concentration were lowest and the result of material of autochthonous origin; (2) a calcium carbonate precipitation period (CCP), in which there were high calcium concentrations in the settling seston; and (3) a rainfall period (R), in which the highest sedimentation rates occurred. Organic C, organic matter, and organic P content were highest in the settling material during the BS period and lowest during the R period. However, during the R period, inorganic-P sedimentation rates were highest and the major P fraction was apatite-P. Total organic, and inorganic (Fe- and Al-bound and apatite) P, increased substantially whereas total and organic C decreased with depth in the material collected by sediment traps during the BS and CCP periods. Consequently, the total C:P (C-t:P-t) and organic C:P (C-org.:P-org.) ratios decreased significantly with increasing depth of sediment traps.

"C." urophthalmus, Petenia splendida, Thorichthys meeki) in Lake Caobas, southern Yucatan Peninsula, were studied. Samples were taken with enclosure and cast nets during the dry and rainy seasons of 1995 (day and night). The environment was characterized by measuring temperature, conductivity and pH. All individuals were below 41 mm SL (N=281). Frequency of occurrence and prey abundance were analyzed. Main prey items were chironomids, mites, copepods, cladocerans, and ostracods. The cichlids fed mainly on zooplankton, with the partial exceptions of P. splendida (piscivore), "C." synspilum and A, spilurus (herbivores). A cluster analysis showed that the most similar trophic spectra were those of T. meeki, "C." robertsoni and "C." salvini, which were also the least diverse, "C." synspilum and A. spilurus had an intermediate distance between their diets and those of other species. The species with the most distinctive feeding composition were P. spiendida (with the most diverse and equitable diet) and the omnivore A. octofasciatus (whose diet was the richest one). T. meeki showed quantitative diel, ontogenetic, and seasonal diet changes, but none between sexes. "C." robertsoni, "C." salvini and "C." synspilum differ in food habits in Caobas and in other localities, a fact that underscores the trophic adaptability of cichlids. Trophic overlap between cichlids in Caobas could imply absence of competition, perhaps because resources are abundant in the ecosystem.

Both soluble and particulate P flowed into the Donana wetlands through runoff. A gradient in the soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations was found from the littoral to the pond center following a 108.5-mm storm. The SRP concentration was 100 times higher 2 m from the shoreline than it was at the pond center. Neither the incoming. SRP nor the total P concentrations were related to the magnitude of storm events. They were always highest during the initial filling periods (first tyoweeks) and lower after subsequent, even heavier storms (>100 mm) a month later. Deposited sediments were a net P sink during the initial filling period of ponds. Samples of fresh vegetation, soil, and manure from a wetland watershed were washed in distilled water for 19 h, and the SRP in the leachates was measured in the laboratory. The highest SRP concentration (1.5 mg gDW(-1)) was leached from the fine (0.1 mm), organic-matter-rich (25% OM) soil diffraction from uplands. The SRP concentration found in pasture soil was 1.3 rag gDW(-1), followed by fresh scrub (1.25 mg gDW(-1)), and manure (0.9 mg gDW(-1)). Only during periods of heavy rainfall does runoff drain from the uplands to the basin of the wetland watersheds. Therefore, we conclude that incoming P concentrations to Donana wetlands vary greatly from year to year according to changes in hydro-meteorological conditions.

J	WELLS, RT; TEDFORD, RH				WELLS, RT; TEDFORD, RH			STHENURUS (MACROPODIDAE, MARSUPIALIA) FROM THE PLEISTOCENE OF LAKE CALLABONNA, SOUTH-AUSTRALIA	BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY												This study of the skeletal remains of three species of the extinct kangaroo Sthenurus (Sthenurinae: Macropodidae) from Lake Callabonna, northern South Australia, details the comparative osteology of these taxa and their functional, anatomical, and phylogenetic implications. Geological study of the locality assigns these fossils to the base of the Quaternary sequence in laminated clay and fine sands that are part of a unit correlated with the Millyera Formation of the Lake Frome area immediately south of Lake Callabonna. These deposits accumulated in a lake of variable salinity, several times the size of the present Callabonna playa. The plant remains associated with the Callabonna Fauna suggest a more arborescent flora than that near the present-day salina but one containing taxa that still exist in the surrounding region. These facts indicate a seasonal climate with fluctuating water table but a regionally more effective rainfall than at present. Direct C-14 dating of wood from the Sthenurus-bearing deposits establishes an age beyond the limit of the radiocarbon method and regional geological correlations suggest a medial Pleistocene age within the span 0.2-0.7 Ma as most likely for the sthenurine kangaroos and associated large marsupials and ratite birds that constitute the Callabonna Fauna. Like the other large-bodied vertebrates at Lake Callabonna, the Sthenurus species were mired in the clays while attempting to cross the floor of the lake during tow-water or dry times. This mode of accumulation has yielded an unprecedented opportunity for comparative study of the remains of individual animals. Three closely allied sthenurine species coexisted at Lake Callabonna: a new giant taxon, Sthenurus stirlingi, a somewhat smaller S. tindalei, and the considerably smaller S. andersoni. Strong sexual dimorphism is shown by the larger taxa, resulting in size overlap between individuals, but morphological criteria identify the sexes and taxa involved. Comparative osteology of these Sthenurus species with Macropus giganteus emphasizes how different they are from the living gray kangaroo, especially in their short, deep skulls, long front feet with very reduced lateral digits, and the virtually monodactyl hind feet. These distinctions, and many others, limit functional analysis for lack of a closely comparable living model. We have nevertheless tried to gather the evidence into a coherent picture of Sthenurus as a living animal. The cheek teeth of these Sthenurus species fit the browsing grade of Sanson's (1978) model. The slender forelimbs are better fitted for feeding than locomotor function. These limbs could be raised above the head, and the hands, with their long phalanges and claws, could have grasped high vegetation. The vertebral column is more rigid than in living kangaroos and flexion is limited, but considerable extension of the anterior part of the body could have been retained as an important function in reaching for high browse. The pelvis is modified for flexion and adduction of the thigh, which would support a bulky animal while standing or elevating the body. The hind limb is more massive than in Macropus, but the elements are of similar proportion and there appears to be greater emphasis on the elastic properties of the tendons and ligaments to augment muscular action across joints, especially the knee and plantar parts of the pes. We conclude that species of Sthenurus, like other sthenurines, were bulky, browsing kangaroos that sacrificed quadrupedal or pentapedal movement for greater dependence on bipedal saltation and extension of the body and forelimbs for higher browsing. This diverse subfamily was a prominent element in Pleistocene faunas in Australia. Several taxa of comparable size were often found together which suggests partitioning of the browsing feeding mode-a broad niche that seems to contain few adherents among living large kangaroos.																			0003-0090	1937-3546					1995		225					1	111																WOS:A1995QZ29500001

M.; Ricciardi, Anthony			Intraspecific variation in the functional response of an invasive crayfish under different temperatures	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Non-native species can react to changes to their thermal environment by altering their feeding behaviour, thereby potentially causing shifts in predator-prey dynamics and competitive dominance over native species. In this study, we measured intraspecific variation in the functional response (i.e., predation rate as a function of prey density) of the rusty crayfish Faxonius rusticus (Girard, 1852) at two temperatures (18 degrees C and 26 degrees C) in the laboratory. We compared six invasive populations spanning a 2 degrees latitudinal gradient in eastern North America to test the prediction that under warmer conditions individuals from more southerly populations exhibit a higher functional response than those from northern populations. Temperature, latitude, and the interaction between these two variables had significant effects on attack rates and handling times of individual crayfish from the tested populations. Contrary to our prediction, the attack rates of individuals from northern populations were consistently higher than those from southern populations at both temperatures. We propose that these interpopulation differences in functional response could arise, at least in part, from countergradient selection. Our results suggest that climate warming promotes spatiotemporal variation in per capita effects across latitudinally distributed populations of aquatic invasive species.

The water qualities showed seasonal changes in which the pH value, dissolved oxygen, and total dissolved solids were generally higher during the dry season, and the water temperature was higher during the wet season. RDA indicated that higher pH values, dissolved oxygen, and total dissolved solids promoted the formation of microbiota communities in the water samples of the dry season, while higher water temperature positively regulated the formation of microbiota communities in the water samples of the wet season. LEFSe identified five biomarkers with the most abundant difference at the genus level, of which TM7a was upregulated in the water samples of the dry season, and SM1A02, Rheinheimera, Gemmatimonas, and Vogesella were upregulated in the water samples of the wet season. Pearson analysis revealed that higher pH values and dissolved oxygen positively regulated the formation of TM7a and negatively regulated the formation of SM1A02, Rheinheimera, Gemmatimonas, and Vogesella (p < 0.05), while higher water temperature had the opposite regulatory roles in the formation of these biomarkers. The relative abundance of microbiota diversity in fish guts varies greatly between different fish species, even if the fishes were collected from the same water source, indicating that dietary habits and fish species may be key factors, affecting the formation and construction of microbiome community in fish gut. P. glenii, P. lagowskii, G. cynocephalus, and L. waleckii were the main fish resources, which were collected and identified from at least six sample points. RDA indicated that the microbiota in the water environment regulated the formation of microbiota community in the guts of G. cynocephalus and L. waleckii and had limited regulated effects on P. glenii and P. lagowskii. The present study identified the regulatory effects of water qualities on the formation of microbiota communities in the water samples and fish guts, providing valuable evidence for the protection of fish resources in the Heilongjiang River.																				1664-302X				AUG 21	2024	15								1435360	10.3389/fmicb.2024.1435360	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2024.1435360								39234540					WOS:001305557000001

This study aims to address the constraints of existing remote sensing analyses for identifying snail habitats, which frequently neglect spatial scale and seasonal variations. To this end, we adopt a multi-source data-driven Random Forest approach that integrates bottomland and ground-surface texture data with traditional environmental variables, enhancing the accuracy of snail habitat assessments. We developed four distinct models for the lake and marshland areas of Guichi, China: a baseline model incorporating ground-surface texture, bottomland variables, and environmental variables; Model 1 with only environmental variables; Model 2 adding ground-surface texture and environmental variables; and Model 3 integrating bottomland with environmental variables. The baseline model outperformed the others, achieving a true skill statistic of 0.93, an accuracy of 0.97, a kappa statistic of 0.94, and an area under the curve of 0.99. Our analysis pinpointed critical high-risk snail habitats distributed in a belt-like pattern along major water bodies, near the Yangtze River, QiuPu River, and around Shengjin Lake, Jiuhua River, and Qingtong River. These insights can aid local health authorities in more efficiently allocating limited resources, developing effective snail surveillance and control strategies to combat schistosomiasis. Additionally, this approach can be adapted to localize other endemic hosts with similar ecological characteristics.

J	Håkanson, L; Sazykina, T				Håkanson, L; Sazykina, T			A blind test of the MOIRA lake model for radiocesium for Lake Uruskul, Russia, contaminated by fallout from the Kyshtym accident in 1957	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY												This paper presents results of a model-test carried out within the framework of the COMETES project (EU). The tested model is a new lake model for radiocesium to be used within the MOIRA decision support system (DSS; MOIRA and COMETES are acronyms for EU-projects). This model has previously been validated against independent data from many lakes covering a wide domain of lake characteristics and been demonstrated to yield excellent predictive power (see Hakanson, Modelling Radiocesium in Lakes and Coastal Areas. Kluwer, Dordrecht, 2000, 215 pp), However, the model has not been tested before for cases other than those related to the Chernobyl fallout in 1986, nor for lakes from this part of the world (Southern Urals) and nor for situations with such heavy fallout as this. The aims of this work were: (1) to carry out a blind test of the model for the case of continental Lake Uruskul, heavily contaminated with Sr-90 and Cs-137 as a result of the Kyshtym radiation accident (29 September 1957) in the Southern Urals, Russia, and (2) if these tests gave satisfactory results to reconstruct the radiocesium dynamics for fish, water and sediments in the lake. Can the model provide meaningful predictions in a situation such as this? The answer is yes, although there are reservations due to the scarcity of reliable empirical data. From the modelling calculations, it may be noted that the maximum levels of Cs-137 in fish (here 400 g ww goldfish), water and sediments were about 100,000 Bq/kg ww, 600 Bq/l and 30,000 Bq/kg dw, respectively. The values in fish are comparable to or higher than the levels in fish in the cooling pond of the Chernobyl NPP. The model also predicts an interesting seasonal pattern in Cs-137 levels in sediments. There is also a characteristic "three phase" development for the Cs-137 levels in fish: first an initial stage when the Cs-137 concentrations in fish approach a maximum value, then a phase with relatively short ecological half-lives followed by a final phase with long ecological half-lives more or less corresponding to the physical decay of radiocesium.

J	Borrego, CM; Bañeras, L; Garcia-Gil, J				Borrego, CM; Bañeras, L; Garcia-Gil, J			Temporal variability of Chlorobium phaeobacteroides antenna pigments in a meromictic karstic lake	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The changes in the antenna pigment composition of Chlorobium phaeobacteroides growing in 2 meromictic basins of Lake Banyoles have been studied during a seasonal growth period. Changes involved both the increase in carotenoid content and the enrichment of the antenna in highly alkylated bacteriochlorophyll e (BChl e) homologs. Interestingly, the homolog composition at the end of the growth period was similar to those measured in laboratory cultures incubated at low Light intensity, which are characterised by high amounts of BChl e homologs possessing larger alkyl substituents at the C-8 position of the macrocycle (i.e, isobutyl and neopentyl). Furthermore, differences in the vertical distribution of both pigments were also observed. Seasonal variation in the antenna pigment composition could be interpreted as a response to gradual changes in light regime during growth, mainly caused by self-shading and by the development of an overlying population of the purple sulphur bacterium Chromatium minus, which acts as a biological filter for Light. The increase in both antenna pigments is discussed on the basis of recent findings on the spectral properties of BChl e and carotenoids and the role in the light adaptation processes is accordingly interpreted.					; Borrego, Carles/M-8094-2014; Bañeras, Lluis/K-6736-2017; Baneras, Lluis/K-6736-2017	Garcia-Gil, Jesus/0000-0002-5064-8361; Borrego, Carles/0000-0002-2708-3753; Baneras, Lluis/0000-0001-6908-3658													0948-3055					MAY 28	1999	17	2					121	129		10.3354/ame017121	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame017121													WOS:000080928300002

The life history of C. plumosus consisted of two univoltine cohorts with an overall production of 1.4 g ash-free dry wt m-2. Gut concentrations of bacteria, Microcystis, and Melosira were several times higher than sedimentary concentrations, indicating that the larvae are foraging selectively. Assimilation of bacteria and newly sedimentary concentrations, indicating that the larvae are foraging selectively. Assimilation of bacteria and newly sedimented Melosira cells on average accounted for 11 and 49% of the estimated carbon requirement (production + respiration) of the larvae. Digestive efficiencies for bacteria and Melosira seasonally averaged 43 and 34%. "Overwintering" Microcystis colonies, which constitute the dominant proportion of microbial biomass in the sediments, were used to a small extent if at all as a carbon source by the chironomids. If a decrease in autofluorescence intensity of cells during gut passage is indicative of partial digestion of the cells, Microcystis was used with a digestive efficiency of 9% and accounted for .apprx. 10% of the carbon requirements of the larvae. On the basis of ambient Chironomus densities, gut passage time, enrichment factor (gut vs. sedimentary density of bacteria), and digestive efficiency, chronomid grazing is not a dominant sink for sedimentary bacteria in Vallentunasjon. The feeding activity of Chironomus larvae decreased bacterial densities but increased the cell-specific production in laboratory experiments. The decrease was not proportional to grazer density, indicating that indirect effects of the chirnonmids (on sedimentary structure and chemistry) also affect the abundance of bacteria.

Isoetes are iconic but understudied wetland plants, despite having suffered severe losses globally mainly because of alterations in their habitats. We therefore provide the first global ecological assessment of aquatic Isoetes to identify their environmental requirements and to evaluate if taxonomically related species differ in their ecology. 2. The assessment resulted in an extensive new database on aquatic Isoetes, ecological niche analyses, and descriptive species accounts. We compiled a global database that includes all known environmental data collected from 1935 to 2023 regarding aquatic Isoetes. We then evaluated the environmental drivers of 16 species using 2,179 global records. Additionally, we used hypervolume analysis to quantify the ecological niches of the two species with the greatest number of records, finding significant differences and evidence that Isoetes echinospora occupies a wider ecological niche than Isoetes lacustris. 3. Fifty-nine species (30% of the c. 200 Isoetes species known today) were categorised as aquatic and were mainly reported in the Americas and northern Europe. About 38% of the aquatic species are threatened with extinction or are endemic to a small region, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List in 2023. Many species were determined to be sensitive to certain water physical and chemical factors, generally preferring oligotrophic conditions such as low total phosphorus, moderate total nitrogen, moderate to low pH, and low conductivity. 4. This analysis includes ecological data in the assessment of rare/threatened aquatic plants globally. This new database and the ecological analyses completed defined the ecological requirements of several species and identified knowledge gaps, which can aid management actions and future research. 5. This paper highlights ecological significance and environmental sensitivities of aquatic Isoetes. The current level of knowledge is inadequate for a large proportion of known taxa. We affirm the extreme need to support global, collaborative initiatives on which to build future conservation strategies.

J	Budzinska, K; Brudnicki, A; Traczykowski, A				Budzinska, Katarzyna; Brudnicki, Adam; Traczykowski, Adam			Survival of Salmonella sp in Surface Waters under Variable Thermal Conditions	ROCZNIK OCHRONA SRODOWISKA												The majority of cases of salmonellosis reported in the journals are related with food. Nevertheless, a number of studies have investigated the incidence and survival of salmonella in rivers, coastal water and lakes. Salmonella is frequently isolated from water sources, which serve as bacterial reservoirs and may possibly aid transmission between hosts. Salmonella is constantly released into the environment from infected humans, farm animals, pets, and wildlife. Compared to other microorganisms, Salmonella sp. has high survival ratio in aquatic environments it outlives Staphylococcus aureus and even the waterborne Vibrio cholerae in surface waters and in heavily eutro-phied river water. Nutrient lack, osmotic stress, visible light and temperature appear to be the abiotic factors that most negatively influence survival. The presence of Salmonella sp. in aquatic environments does not vary seasonally and is independent of water temperature. Due to its common accessibility, water is an environment which plays an essential role in spread of diseases. The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of selected temperatures on the survival rate of bacilli of the genus Salmonella, and the dynamics of quantitative changes of the bacteria in time in bathing waters used for recreation, tested under laboratory conditions. The samples for the study were collected from Borowno lake in the commune of Dobrez, county Bydgoszcz. In the experiment it was stated that Salmonella bacilli survived longer in water at 4 degrees C (20 weeks), as compared with 20 degrees C (12 weeks). According to regression analysis, reduction rate of bacterial population in the present study at 4 degrees C was 0.54 log, while at 20 degrees C it was higher and amounted to 0.62 log. Therefore, it can be concluded that a lower temperature has a stabilizing effect on bacilli of the genus Salmonella.

J	Burns, KC				Burns, K. C.			Dietary diversity in fruit-eating birds: a biogeographic comparison between New Zealand and Canada	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												If deterministic processes consistently structure ecological communities, similar patterns in species interactions should be observed in different geographic areas that experience similar environmental conditions. I tested for convergent patterns in dietary diversity of fruit-eating birds inhabiting similar latitude forests in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. I observed birds foraging for fruits over two fruiting seasons in both Nelson Lakes National Park, South Island, New Zealand, and the Pacific Rim National Park, Vancouver Island, Canada. I then conducted rarefaction analyses to compare community-level and species-level dietary diversity between geographic locales. Relationships between the size of each bird species and the average size of fruits consumed were also assessed. Results showed that the New Zealand bird community had greater overall dietary diversity than the Canadian community. However, similar levels of dietary diversity were observed among species within communities in both hemispheres. Positive relationships between bird size and fruit size were observed in New Zealand, but not in Canada. Therefore, while results showed some support for dietary convergence between hemispheres, several substantial differences were also observed, leading to mixed support for convergent patterns in the diets of fruit-eating birds between hemispheres.																			0110-6465	1177-7788					2009	33	1					52	59																WOS:000265945000005
J	Carlson, JS				Carlson, Julia			Prose mesuree in the Lakes tour and guide: quoting and recalibrating English blank verse	EUROPEAN ROMANTIC REVIEW												In this paper I consider Wordsworth's blank verse and Lake District tours and guides in the context of debates about meter. Neo-classical critiques had cast blank verse as a visual trick of the typographical page: as prose posing as verse by appearing in lines. In this paper I argue that the transformed textual conditions made possible by an expanded print culture contributed to the Romantic revaluation of the blank-verse measure and the valorization of its lyric form. In effect, blank verse's visual aspects were naturalized and nationalized. I isolate a particular kind of Romantic-era page on which blank verses frequently appeared, that of the tour and guidebook, exploring the effects of this print format on the verse. Tours and guidebooks celebrated visual features of specifically English landscapes and quoted national poets to do so. In works published between 1774 and 1835, Gilpin, Hutchinson, Housman, and Wordsworth supplemented landscapes plotted in prose with extracts from Paradise Lost, Night Thoughts, The Seasons, Mason's English Garden, and, in Wordsworth's case, his own unpublished manuscripts. The guides cast blank-verse excerpts both as agents of affective finish and visual coherence and as national textual heritage that illuminated Britain's native forms and contours. Wordsworth's Guide through the District of the Lakes formalized blank-verse lyric by making salient its more minute graphic lines of emphasis and aligning these with nature's marks in land and sky.																			1050-9585	1740-4657					2009	20	2			SI		227	236		10.1080/10509580902840509	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10509580902840509													WOS:000211744800010

Samples were collected during different seasons (February, May and August in 2007) from two distinct ecological sites. A total of 695 clones from six libraries were clustered into 162 operational taxonomic unit (OTU), most of which were affiliated with cryptophyta, stramenopile, alveolata, fungi, cercozoa or chlorophyta. Overall, 74% of OTUs were < 98% similar to any sequences in GenBank, and 56% of these were < 95% similar to previously recovered sequences, which is indicative of undersampled taxa in freshwater ecosystems. Both sites included many unique OTUs and the MECC diversities were higher at East Bay than at Meiliang Bay. Nearly 90% of OTUs were only detected in one of three seasons, suggesting a temporal variation of MECC. Canonical correspondence analysis suggested that concentrations of total phosphorus and total dissolved nitrogen and the densities of cladocera and rotifera were the most important factors in explaining the spatio-temporal-variations of MECC.					l, w/KIC-0753-2024														0065-1583	1689-0027					2009	48	3					245	264																WOS:000273844500005

Males are separable by the ventral structure of S8 and often differ in the colour of the venation and genital lobe. Females are as yet not reliably distinguishable. Examination of 1,154 males demonstrated that both species are widespread: the true B. leucosticta occupies most of tropical Africa and Madagascar, while B. impartita (comb. nov.; corrected spelling - neotype male: Ngaoundaba Ranch, Cameroon; in RMNH) ranges north and south of the Sahara, and extends into Eurasia. The two overlap from The Gambia to Ethiopia and south at least to Lake Victoria. The presence of wing bands was scored for all examined males and 970 females. Banded females are frequent in sub-Saharan populations of B. impartita, bur virtually absent in B. leucosticta and northern B. impartita. B. impartita males become banded shortly after emergence, but B. leucosticta becomes so more gradually. Larval morphology and ecology require further study, but some ecological and seasonal segregation may Occur in areas of overlap. Of two larval forms described from Uganda, the 'mud form' may pertain to B. leucosticta, and the 'sand form' to B. impartita.

During this study, surface water, groundwater, and sediment samples were collected for two distinctive seasons in 2006-2007 at 58 monitoring sites along and near the Siem Reap River, in Tole Sap Lake (TSL), and West Baray, the primary water resources in this region. To assess the seasonal and spatial variability of 27 water quality parameters, multivariate analysis of variance, hierarchical cluster analysis, and the Kruskal-Wallis test were conducted using the obtained data. Differences and relationships between the surface water and groundwater were also investigated using t-test and correlation analysis, respectively. The results of these tests showed that the bacterial indicators need special attention as the urban infrastructure of the downtown area caused increased levels of these bacterial indicators in both surface water and groundwater. However, for most parameters, though surface water showed strong seasonal variations, groundwater presented relatively stable conditions between seasons (p > 0.05) with site-specific geochemical conditions. Sediment quality illustrated that pollution levels of 10 trace metals were the highest in TSL because of its unique characteristic (river with backward flow), but did not reflect any potential enrichment from urban development. Overall, the results reveal that while the urban infrastructure in this region has not significantly affected most of the water quality parameters, bacteria and coliphages are still a main concern due to their contributions in widespread waterborne diseases. Thus, careful mitigation plans for reducing each pollutant source are needed in the Angkor area.

Inland waters are thought to be important sources of methane, although detailed studies of emissions (diffusion and ebullition) are limited. This is the reason why we investigated the sediments of three anthropogenic lakes with respect to methane formation. Methane of microbial origin could be proved in any case. In one case, methane was released into the atmosphere by ebullition. The measured fluxes ranged between 134 and 935 mg CH4 m(-2)d(-1). The fluxes close above the sediments were higher (274-4107 mgCH(4) m(-2)d(-1)). The decrease of methane content in the bubbles from greater to lower sampling depths is connected with an increase in its delta C-13 values. The Rayleigh equation has been used to calculate fractionation factors alpha between 1.0104 and 1.0163, which means that the changes are due to oxidation processes within the predominant oxic water column. However, large amounts of methane still reach the atmosphere.																			1025-6016	1477-2639					2009	45	3					231	246		10.1080/10256010902931269	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10256010902931269								20183235					WOS:000270002700006

Management of the Arkansas River Commercial Paddlefish Fishery with Check Stations and Special Seasons	PADDLEFISH MANAGEMENT, PROPAGATION, AND CONSERVATION IN THE 21ST CENTURY: BUILDING FROM 20 YEARS OF RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT	American Fisheries Society Symposium				Symposium on Paddlefish Conservation and Management	DEC 05, 2006	Omaha, NE	Amer Fisheries Soc				Four special commercial fishing seasons (5-10 d) with mandatory check stations were used to closely monitor the harvest and exploitation of paddlefish Polyodon spathula in Ozark Lake and Pool 13 of the Arkansas River, Arkansas. The mean number of fishers (+/-SD) participating was 36 +/- 25, and participation of statewide licensed fishers was high at 64% +/- 18%. Average harvest (+/-SD) among seasons was 1,538 +/- 652 fish and 866 +/- 319 gravid females. The mean harvest rate (+/-SD) was 12 +/- 6 fish/fisher-day effort. Exploitation estimates ranged between 19% and 40% during the 5-d seasons. Catch declined as the season progressed at Pool 13 and with a time lag at Ozark Lake. The short-term special seasons comprised 11-22% of the Arkansas statewide roe harvest for 2003, 2004, and 2006. The 5-d special season comprised 63% of the roe and 32% of the gravid females harvested for the 150-d Ozark Lake 2006-2007 season. A total of 27 citations were written for illegal activities, and bycatch mortality was a serious management concern at the 2006 Pool 13 season. Check stations provided a valuable management tool for accurately determining harvest and exploitation, and the brief special seasons allowed for controlled, monitored, and limited harvest. Illegal activities and large increases in the number of fishers entering the fishery were major threats to management for a sustainable roe fishery.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-12-7				2009	66						261	275																WOS:000278471300016

Ring dike system to harness floodwater from the Mekong River for paddy rice cultivation in the Tonle Sap Lake floodplain in Cambodia	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Located in the floodplain of the Mekong River and the Tonle Sap River, Batheay irrigation system and its reservoir directly receive floodwater from the Mekong. The Batheay reservoir formed by a ring dike functions as both a reservoir and a paddy field. In the wet season, the ring dike prevents floodwater from entering the reservoir and rainy season rice is grown inside the dike. After harvesting, the gates on the ring dike are opened to receive floodwater. The water is stored inside the dike for cultivating dry season rice outside the dike. In this paper, the irrigation system is studied as a model site for future development of the floodplain of the Tonle Sap Lake of Cambodia. Specifically, this paper is concerned with the study of water balance and analysis of the hydrologic components of the Batheay irrigation system, and the effectiveness of the ring dike system. The study found that floodwater of the Mekong River contributed about 74% to the total inflow to the Batheay reservoir. Contributions to the total water supply of reservoir water, floodwater remaining in the fields, and precipitation were 73, 12, and 15%, respectively. The efficiency of the system was found to be 92%. The dike system is expected to be a paradigm for the floodplain of the Tonle Sap Lake. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Parasite transmission stage abundance varies in lakes over time and space	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Environmentally transmitted parasites produce transmission stages that can remain viable and infective for extended periods of time in the environment where susceptible hosts may encounter them. Although many parasites have this mode of transmission, the abundance and distribution of environmental transmission stages have largely been overlooked, especially in aquatic habitats. Without empirical data to characterize spatial and temporal dynamics of parasite transmission stages in the environment, we might make incorrect assumptions about host-parasite contact rates. For aquatic environments, seasonal habitat structure driven by thermal stratification has been hypothesized to affect the patchiness of transmission stages within the water column, leading to uneven exposure risk to hosts. In this study, we quantified transmission stage concentrations of five common parasites of Daphnia spp. and Ceriodaphnia dubia at every meter of the water column at the deep basin of six lakes in southeastern Michigan every 2 weeks from June to November 2021. We found that transmission stage concentration varied by orders of magnitude over time and with depth. We investigated several possible drivers of these spatial and temporal patterns. For instance, our results suggest that greater mixing depth decreased transmission stage vertical patchiness within the water column of lakes with lower Fee's p values. However, horizontal spore patchiness across a lake was not correlated with the nearshore-offshore gradient of our study lakes. Overall, the results of our study show that parasite transmission stage concentrations have spatial and temporal dynamics that could affect disease dynamics within highly structured aquatic environments.					; Duffy, Meghan/E-6867-2016	Duffy, Meghan/0000-0002-8142-0802; Davenport, Elizabeth/0000-0002-2139-6820; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	2024	69	9					2167	2179		10.1002/lno.12657	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.12657		AUG 2024											WOS:001290030500001

In order to assess its restoration perspectives the groundwater acid neutralization capacity (ANC(aq)) of various sites was discussed in relation to the decalcification depth, amount of organic matter and amount of nitrogen in the topsoil layer. The decalcification depth reflected the (former) hydrological regime quite well; shallow in the exfiltration zone and deep in the infiltration part of the slack. The pattern of HCO3-, SO42- and pH reflected the functioning of a flow-through lake, even when the slack was not flooded. Relies of low productivity (mesotrophic) vegetation (Samolo-Littorelletum) with rare species were related to low amounts of organic matter and nitrogen in the topsoil layer. At this site the variation in HCO3- concentration was also relatively low during the year. It was hypothesized that a regular supply of acid buffering components from calcareous soil layers buffers the pH at a high level and slows down the accumulation of organic matter thus creating opportunities for the rare basiphilous plant species. A possible biological control mechanism for these processes was discussed. A reconstruction of the former, present and future eco-hydrological situation was made of the dune slack.

J	Ryden, DW; Ahlm, LA				Ryden, DW; Ahlm, LA			Observations on the distribution and movements of Colorado squawfish, Ptychocheilus lucius, in the San Juan River, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah	SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST												Seventeen adult Colorado squawfish (Ptychocheilus lucius) were captured between June 1991 and October 1994 during sampling conducted on the San Juan River in New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah. Thirteen individuals were surgically implanted with internal radio transmitters. Telemetry, capture, and recapture data indicated that most adult Colorado squawfish were sedentary and had a strong affinity for a 39.0 km reach of the river (river km 228.2 to 180.2) upstream of the Colorado-Utah border. Seven fish aggregated prior to spawning in and around the Mancos River confluence (km 197.3). Eleven fish, including six of the seven that aggregated in the vicinity of the Mancos River, moved a short distance upstream to a 5.8 km reach of the river (km 214.6 to 208.8) during the probable spawning seasons (late June to mid-August). Only one radiotelemetered Colorado squawfish during our study displayed migratory behavior and then only in association with spawning. Life stages of Colorado squawfish were spatially separated, with adults generally occurring upstream of captured larvae and juvenile fish. The recent formation of a waterfall at the confluence of the San Juan River and Lake Powell, and its subsequent inundation, poses a management conundrum for all life stages of this endangered species in the San Juan River. The waterfall appears to be a physical barrier to the upstream movement of adult Colorado squawfish from Lake Powell. However, it also seems to inhibit the invasion of the lower San Juan River by lentic predators, thereby protecting early life stages of Colorado squawfish that are found almost exclusively in this section of the river.																			0038-4909	1943-6262				JUN	1996	41	2					161	168																WOS:A1996WH68700011

Its water is utilized for drinking, agriculture, and aquaculture, while industrial and agricultural wastewater is discharged into this valuable body of water. This study aimed to measure the concentration of two heavy metals, nickel and lead, and organochlorine toxins in the water and sediment of this river. Water samples were taken from the Sefidrud River at three stations in four seasons to measure the concentration of the above-mentioned two heavy metals organochlorine toxins as well as some physiochemical parameters of the water. Results showed that the annual mean water temperature, calcium, magnesium, electrical conductivity (EC), T.D.S, pH, and dissolved oxygen in water samples were 16.35 degrees C, 77 mg/l, 28.41 mg/l, 1245.41 mS/m, 782.7, 8.01, and 7.91 mg/l. The mean annual concentration of nickel and lead was also 0.008 +/- 0.001 and 0.001 +/- 0 mg/l in water and 29.75 +/- 1.19 and 313.4 +/- 17.13 mg/l in sediments. The results also showed that the mean annual concentration of Pertilachlor was 0.40 +/- 0.046 mg/l in water and 2.91 +/- 0.476 mg/l in sediments, and the mean annual concentration of Saturn was 2.81 +/- 0.47 mg/l in water and 0.39 +/- 0.47 mg/l in sediments. Since the sediments of the Sefidrud River contain relatively high concentrations of heavy metals such as lead and nickel as well as organochlorine toxins, the river should be regarded as polluted; therefore, the discharge of pollutants and wastewater into this river should be properly managed.

J	Shaw, JL; Curry, RA				Shaw, Jennifer L.; Curry, R. Allen			Ontogenetic divergence of growth among rainbow smelt morphotypes	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Multiple, sympatric morphotypes of rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) are known in Lake Utopia, New Brunswick. The largest, 'giant' form is predominantly a piscivore, the smaller, 'dwarf' form are predominantly planktivores, and there is an intermediate body-sized form. The forms exhibit some genetic variability, but it is body size that best defines morphotypes, trophic status, and spawning behaviour. We compared egg size, spawning date, incubation time, size at hatching, and daily and annual growth to determine when divergence in body size occurs among morphotypes. Giant form larvae hatched earlier and grew faster during their first year. Dwarf and intermediate form larvae displayed inter-annual variability in degree of overlap and divergence in growth which occurred in their first growing season or at age 1+ or 2+. We conclude that earlier hatching, early growth trajectories, and later niche shifting are linked to the persistence of morphotypes, i.e., the process is controlled by the environment and sustained to some degree by spawning segregation.

J	Adrian, R; Schipolowski, T				Adrian, R; Schipolowski, T			Bacterial and protozoan mass accumulation in the deep chlorophyll maximum of a mesotrophic lake	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) represent high accumulations of algal biomass in the microaerobic metalimnion of mesotrophic lakes characterised by a few algal species which persist in time. We studied the accumulation of bacteria, protozoans and the mesozooplankton associated with the DCM of mesotrophic GroBer Vatersee in northern Germany over a three year period and related our findings to the pattern found in the epilimnion and the hypolimnion. More than 20% of the bacterial and protozoan biomass was concentrated in the narrow layer of the DCM, which comprised less than 10% of the whole water column. Between 16 and 36% of the rotifers and 12 - 31% of the juvenile cyclopoid copepods inhabited the DCM permanently on a day/night time scale, while calanoid copepods and adult cyclopoid copepods concentrated in the upper metalimnion and migrated into the DCM occasionally. Although bacteria and flagellates were generally larger in the DCM than in the epilimnion, ratios between bacterial and protozoan biomass were similar in both lake compartments. Our findings confirm a uniform community structure in the DCM of ciliates (Dexiotricha spp. and Strobilidium spp. comprised on average 70% of ciliate biomass) and, to a lesser extent, of mesozooplankton (rotifers and juvenile cyclopoid copepods dominated in the DCM). In contrast seasonal and interannual patterns of bacterial and protozoan biomass and cell size imply variation in the effects of predation.																			0003-9136					APR	2003	157	1					27	46		10.1127/0003-9136/2003/0157-0027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2003/0157-0027													WOS:000183318300002

The diets of perch and ruffe in relation to food resources were quantified over a 5-mo period in one lake of moderate and one lake of high productivity. The abundance of perch decreased and that of ruffe increased along the productivity gradient. Large perch ate fish over the whole season in the more productive lake, but rarely ate fish in May and June in the less productive lake. All size classes of ruffe fed mainly on macrobenthos in both lakes. The diversity of macrobenthos was higher in the lake of low productivity, as was the diet breadth of ruffe. The abundance patterns of perch and ruffe are likely related to the simultaneous effect of increasing prey abundance and decreasing light penetration with increasing productivity. Furthermore, the abundance of perch is likely affected by increasing interspecific competition and that of ruffe by decreasing predation pressure as productivity increases.

However, the impact of shallow groundwater table (SGWT) fluctuations driven by seasonal variations on the N accumulation characterizations in the soil profiles has not been well quantified, particularly in the regions with thin layer vadose zone. Through in-situ monitoring and simulation experiments, the changes in the SGWT and N accumulation of soil profile in intensive cropland around 7 plateau lakes in Yunnan were studied during the rainy season (RS) and dry season (DS), and the N loss in soil profile of cropland driven by SGWT fluctuations was estimated. The results showed that the SGWT and N accumulation in soil profile of cropland around the plateau lakes had obvious seasonal variation characteristics. The proportion of N storage in different forms in 60-100 cm soil layer in the RS was greater than that in the DS, particularly the proportion of NH4+-N storage was as high as 55 %, while N accumulation in surface soil was obvious in the DS. Compared with the DS, due to the rising SGWT in the RS, the maximum storages of TN and NO3--N in the 0-100 cm soil layer decreased by17% and 36 %, respectively. The TN loss intensities from the 0-100 cm soil profiles of cropland around Fuxian Lake, Yilong Lake, Qilu Lake, Dianchi Lake, Yangzong Lake, Erhai Lake, and Xingyun Lake were 74, 54, 127, 105, 93, 72 and 207 kg/ha, respectively. Moreover, if the SGWT was <30 cm, the average TN loss intensity and amount could reach 177 kg/ha and 1250 t, respectively. Therefore, the SGWT regulation was one of the key measures to reducing soil N loss from the thin layer vadose zone of cropland around plateau lakes and improving groundwater quality.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				NOV 10	2024	950								175300	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.175300	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.175300		AUG 2024						39111447					WOS:001294471000001

The sediments are rhythmically laminated and consist of coarser, pale silt layers which alternate with darker clay layers containing occasional thin laminae of fine sand and coarse silt. The pale silt layers contain single or multiple normally graded laminae, erosional surfaces and soft sediment deformation structures, indicating deposition from multiple high density underflows. The dark clay layers have sharp upper and lower contacts and an internal fabric consistent with deposition from a combination of flocculation and grain-by-grain deposition. Silt laminae within the clay layers are interpreted as sporadic turbidity underflows. The sediments are interpreted as annually laminated (varved). Varves deposited close to the ice margin showed considerable spatial variation in thickness and adjacent sequences could not be correlated; however sequences of medial varves separated by 500 m were correlatable by thickness. As glaciolacustrine deposits are widespread throughout the Irish midlands, it is likely that a varve chronology could be constructed.

Seismicity in Iceland during 2006	JOKULL												Approximately 9,500 earthquakes were detected in Iceland during 2006 by the SIL seismic network of the Icelandic Meteorological Office. This is similar to the number of earthquakes registered in 2005, but slightly less than in preceding years. The largest earthquake occurred on 6 March, east of Lake Kleifarvatn on the Reykjanes Peninsula. The event, which was preceded by foreshocks, had a local moment magnitude of 4.7 (M-lw); additionally, several aftershocks were registered. Three earthquake swarms were recorded a few kilometers east of the tip of the Reykjanes Peninsula. Sparse activity has previously been recorded in this area. In the Hengill region, the largest earthquake sequence was a swarm of 80 earthquakes on 29 May. No major activity was recorded in the South Iceland Seismic Zone. Seismicity beneath Gooabunga in the Myrdalsjokull ice cap followed a.seasonal pattern, as in the last few years and preceding 2002. North of Gooabunga, beneath Entujokull, a short-lived swarm of high-frequency earthquakes took place in November. The largest earthquake in the Vatnajokull region was a mainshock-aftershock sequence in the northwestern sector of the ice cap in September. The majority of earthquakes in the Askja-Heroubreio) area, north of the Vatnajokull ice cap, were recorded in two earthquake swarms: one northwest of Heroubreioartogl in April and the other north of Heroubreio in May. The most intense earthquake sequence of the year was a mainshock-aftershock sequence within the Tjornes Fracture Zone. The sequence occurred southeast of the island Flatey at the beginning of November, initiated by a mainshock of magnitude 4.2. Over a seven-day period in September, a swarm. of intraplate earthquakes was detected in the Western Fjords, within a Tertiary fault zone.																			0449-0576						2007	57						45	60																WOS:000255030200004

The larval densities obtained were analyzed to reveal their spatial distribution. Two sequential surveys were performed in order to estimate the temporal stability. Significant correlations of vendace larval densities were found between the first and second surveys of the same year and between the different sampling years. Spatial distribution analysis showed that the squared differences of larval densities between different sampling sites were high and fairly constant at a scale of distances from 2 km and greater from their site origin. Thus, a minimum distances 2 km between sampling sites produces a random sample of independent observations. In contrast, small distances between sampling sites can be utilized by interpolating the areal pattern of density via geostatistical methods. Fixed and random sampling site procedures were compared. Use of fixed sampling sites from year to year produced more accurate within-season mortality estimates and increased detectability of between-year variation in larval vendace density than random sampling.

J	Romo, S; Galanti, G				Romo, S; Galanti, G			Vertical and seasonal distribution of epiphytic algae on water chestnut (Trapa natans)	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Changes in density, biomass, Shannon-Wiener diversity and equitability of epiphytes on different parts of Trapa natans (lamina, petiole, stem and roots) are described during the life cycle of this floating-leaved aquatic plant in the shallow eutrophic lake, Lago di Candia, northern Italy. The seasonal standing crop of epiphyton paralleled that of water chestnut, although the maximum biomass of epiphyton preceded by one month that of the host plant. Epiphytic algal succession moved from prostrate chlorophytes and adnate diatoms towards basally attached species and later to filamentous cyanophytes. Epiphytic algal assemblages showed clear differences according to the different plant parts and depths. There was a decrease in the mean abundance, biomass and cell size of epiphytes from upper to lower parts of the plant and species succession in lower parts was delayed and shortened compared with that in the upper parts. There was a greater presence of filamentous green algae, desmids and filamentous N-2-fixing cyanophytes on the lamina and petiole than on the stem and roots, where communities were mostly comprised of small diatoms and a filamentous cyanophyte. Species dynamics on stern and roots situated at the same depths were similar. Several factors accounted in determining the composition and abundance of epiphytic communities, such as plant architecture and age, and physicochemical variables, such as light within the Trapa belt.																			0003-9136					MAR	1998	141	4					483	504																WOS:000072984200008

This water body is a promising natural preserved environment and has been attracting the developer to develop tourist spots to fulfill their profit margin. Such approach commonly has been polluting the environment since the past few decades. In the present study, the hydrological and water qual-ity assessment on rivers was carried out to identify the existing physical environment of Kenyir Lake Basin. Samples and in-situ data were collected at 19 stations during the dry and wet season. The obtained data was compared with National Water Quality Standard (NWQS) for Malaysian waters as well as interpreted and analysis using chemometrics technique. Based on the climatol-ogy and hydrological data, it has been observed that the sedimentation rate is increasing which may damage the Kenyir Dam turbines in the future. Besides that, the water quality of Kenyir Lake Basin is complied to Class IIB NWQS which is suitable for recreational use with body con-tact. Similarly, Kenyir Lake Basin is classified as Class III based on Malaysian Department of Environment (DOE) water quality index; which is suitable for body contact recreational activities but requires an extensive treatment. The chemometrics analysis has highlighted total dissolved solid, turbidity (TUR), biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand and salinity have affecting the water quality. Additionally, dissolved oxygen and pH showed higher potential risk toward the environmental process management and monitoring owing to the development sur-round Kenyir catchment area. The present findings advocate a higher management method to facil-itate the preservation and maintain the life of Kenyir Lake Basin.

Evaluation of SENTINEL-2 products-based algorithms in estimating water pollutants of the River Niger in Bamako	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS												Monitoring surface water quality on a spatio-temporal scale is very important to restrict the entry of polluting components into water bodies, particularly rivers. Traditional techniques of assessing water quality are typically costly and time-consuming. With the advent of remote sensing technologies and the availability of high-resolution satellite images in recent years, a significant opportunity for water quality monitoring has arisen. Our study aims to test the use of Sentienl-2 multispectral imaging sensors in estimating three important water quality parameters: chlorophyll-a, Colored Dissolved Organic Matter and Total Suspended Matter in Niger River. Sentinel-2 satellite data were acquired in 2020. Atmospheric correction was performed using Sen2cor from the Sentinel toolbox to obtain a geometrically corrected Sentinel-2 multispectral image. We selected multiple water-body indices from the literature based on their spectral reflection characteristics, analyze correlations between the reflectance values of water body indices and the water quality parameters of synchronous measured sampling points in order to obtain an optimal water body index for estimating water quality parameters (WQP) in Niger River. Five regression functions were used in this study: linear regression, exponential, logarithmic, power and polynomial regression. The performance and accuracy of these regression models were evaluated by correlating spectral reflectance band ratio against the in situ water quality parameters (WQP) concentrations. Polynomial regression gave a higher performance and accuracy based on their R values. The best spectral index was selected to assess the spatio-temporal distribution of water pollutants in the Niger River in Bamako and its surroundings. The results showed that the polynomial regression of 6th degree provided the best fit had the best spectral band ratio and in situ Chl-a, CDOM and TSM concentrations which were respectively achieved with band index of B2/B3 (R2 = 0.78), B3/B6 (R 2 = 0.79) and B3/B4 (R 2 = 0.63). Therefore, the best band ratio was selected to evaluate Chl-a spatio-temporal in Niger River water in Bamako. The results of this study showed seasonal variability of the water pollutants in the Niger River. This highlights the potential of the Sentinel-2 products for water quality analysis. As a conclusion, the Sentinel-2 images could be helpful for precise water quality control of Niger River in Bamako.

J	Kirchner, PB; Hannam, MP				Kirchner, Peter B.; Hannam, Michael P.			Volume-Mediated Lake-Ice Phenology in Southwest Alaska Revealed through Remote Sensing and Survival Analysis	WATER												Lakes in Southwest Alaska are a critical habitat to many species and provide livelihoods to many communities through subsistence fishing, transportation, and recreation. Consistent and reliable data are rarely available for even the largest lakes in this sparsely populated region, so data-intensive methods utilizing long-term observations and physical data are not possible. To address this, we used optical remote sensing (MODIS 2002-2016) to establish a phenology record for key lakes in the region, and we modeled lake-ice formation and breakup for the years 1982-2022 using readily available temperature and solar radiation-based predictors in a survival modeling framework that accounted for years when lakes did not freeze. Results were validated with observations recorded at two lakes, and stratification measured by temperature arrays in three others. Our model provided good predictions (mean absolute error, freeze-over = 11 days, breakup = 16 days). Cumulative freeze-degree days and cumulative thaw-degree days were the strongest predictors of freeze-over and breakup, respectively. Lake volume appeared to mediate lake-ice phenology, as ice-cover duration tended to be longer and less variable in lower-volume lakes. Furthermore, most lakes < 10 km(3) showed a trend toward shorter ice seasons of -1 to -6 days/decade, while most higher-volume lakes showed undiscernible or positive trends of up to 2 days/decade. Lakes > 20 km(3) also showed a greater number of years when freeze-over was neither predicted by our model (37 times, n = 200) nor observed in the MODIS record (19 times, n = 60). While three lakes in our study did not commonly freeze throughout our study period, four additional high-volume lakes began experiencing years in which they did not freeze, starting in the late 1990s. Our study provides a novel approach to lake-ice prediction and an insight into the future of lake ice in the Boreal region.

Therefore, understanding ecosystem structure in response to ongoing pressures is crucial for sustaining ecological integrity and human well-being. We aim to assess the disturbance and its effects on the vegetation structure of urban forests in Chandigarh using a combination of remote sensing techniques and vegetation surveys. The disturbance was evaluated as a change in NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) from 2001 to 2021 by applying the BFAST (Breaks For Additive Season and Trend) algorithm to the MODIS satellite imagery data. A vegetation survey was conducted to compare the species composition, taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity as measures of forest vegetational structure. While signals of disturbance were evident, the changes in vegetation structure were not well established from our study. Further, this analysis indicated no significant differences in vegetation composition due to disturbance (F1,12 = 0.91, p = 0.575). However, the phylogenetic diversity was substantially lower for disturbed plots than undisturbed plots, though the taxonomic diversity was similar among the disturbed and undisturbed plots. Our results confirmed that disturbance effects are more prominent on the phylogenetic than taxonomic diversity. These findings can be considered early signals of disturbance and its impact on the vegetation structure of urban forests and contribute to the knowledge base on urban ecosystems. Our study has implications for facilitating evidence-based decision-making and the development of sustainable management strategies for urban forest ecosystems.

In anaerobic environments such as wetlands, paddy fields, and reservoirs, methanogens are the primary contributors to methane production. In this study, high-throughput sequencing of the mcrA functional gene was utilized to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the community structure, metabolic pathways, and influencing factors of methanogens in the sediment of 18 reservoirs on the northeastern Qinghai Plateau. The results indicated that the construction of reservoirs has altered the physicochemical properties of river water and sediments, significantly impacting the distribution and succession of methanogenic communities in the sediment. In general, this study can improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms of methane emissions from the reservoirs on the Qinghai Plateau. Reservoirs are a hotspot for methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas. However, the microbial basis for methane production in the Qinghai Plateau reservoirs remains unclear. To explore the characteristics of methanogenic communities in reservoir sediments on the northeastern Qinghai Plateau, sediment samples were collected from 18 reservoirs in the Yellow River basin during May 2023 (dry season) and August 2023 (wet season). High-throughput sequencing technology was employed to analyze the community composition, diversity, and co-occurrence network of methanogens. Furthermore, FAPROTAX and Mantel analysis were used to assess the metabolic functions of methanogens and their influencing factors. The results showed that (1) the predominant genera of methanogens were Methanobacterium (28.87%) and Methanosarcina (21.67%). Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was the main pathway in the sediments. (2) Significant spatiotemporal differences were observed in the diversity of methanogenic communities (p < 0.05). The composition and diversity of these communities were found to be significantly influenced by temperature, pH, altitude, organic carbon, and total nitrogen (p < 0.05). (3) Methanosarcina, Methanobacterium, and Methanospirillum play crucial roles in maintaining the stability of methanogenic community networks. The co-occurrence network nodes are predominantly positively correlated (99.82%). These results provide data for further studies on carbon cycling in the Qinghai Plateau reservoirs.

The maize yield data were obtained from the Kenya Maize Yield Database while climatic variable data were obtained from the Climatic Research Unit gridded Time Series (CRU TS) with a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope tests showed no trend in the data for maximum temperature, minimum temperature and precipitation. The spatial maps patterns highlight the rampancy of wetter areas in the Lake Victoria basin and Highlands East of Rift Valley compared to other regions. Additionally, there is a decreasing trend in the spatial distribution of precipitation in wetter areas and an increasing trend in maximum temperature in dry areas, albeit not statistically significant. Spearman's rank correlation test showed a strong positive correlation between maize yield and the climatic parameters for the Lake Victoria basin, Highlands East of Rift Valley, Coastal Strip and North Western Regions. The findings suggest that climate variability has a significant impact on maize yield for four out of six climatological zones. We recommend adoption of policies and frameworks that will augment adaptive capacity and build resilience to climatic changes.					; Abdel-Fattah, Mohammed/HMP-3758-2023; Saber, Mohamed/H-8261-2019	Saber, Mohamed/0000-0003-2420-8132; Abdel-Fattah, Mohammed/0000-0002-0139-1889; 														2077-0472				AUG	2024	14	8							1415	10.3390/agriculture14081415	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture14081415													WOS:001305181500001
J	Hautot, S				Hautot, S			Modeling temporal variations of electrical resistivity associated with pore pressure change in a kilometer-scale natural system	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												[1] From 1995 to 1998 the natural electric field was monitored with an array of 20 dipoles on a ridge separating two reservoir lakes in the French Alps. The experiment was run to study the correlation between the electric potential variations and transient deformations of the ridge in association with the annual cycle of lake level variations. Large distortion of the induced electric field is observed and is found almost purely static and well correlated to the geology. A simple DC 3-D model is constructed, and resistivity structures that create the distortion are identified. The electrically resistive crystalline bedrock strongly amplifies the static distortion caused by the heterogeneous geology on the ridge. The temporal variations of the electric distortion observed over two years are associated with the lake level cycle. The model suggests that a resistivity variation of the order of 20% in the bedrock can account for the observed seasonal time-varying distortion. The resistivity change could be explained in terms of pore and crack geometry change controlled by stress. This study suggests that in particular geological contexts, electrical resistivity changes in structures can be detected through an amplification of the static distortion of the induced electric field. The results provide a framework to interpret some observations of electric field variations possibly associated with tectonic activity. The galvanic coupling model proposed here is an alternative to the streaming potential effect model, and it defines new criteria for the surface detection of groundwater in the crust.																			1525-2027					JUN 15	2005	6								Q06005	10.1029/2004GC000859	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2004GC000859													WOS:000229985400001

We received new data on the formation of the thermocline. It is shown that the thermocline of the lake is formed only in the daytime and in a top-heated 0.5-1.0 m layer. The vertical temperature gradient reaches 2.5 degrees C in the first meter, and the spatial average temperature across the lake showed that the northern end of the lake is, on average, 1 degrees C warmer than the southern end. We numerically modeled the currents in the lake for the dry season using the HAMSOM 2D hydrodynamic model. The simulation results are in good agreement with the acoustic Doppler current profiler ADCP measurements.

In this chapter, we discuss characteristics of the environmental conditions and bacterioplankton communities in mountain lakes, by integrating the results of our survey conducted in Japanese mountain lakes with the knowledge from previous studies. Mountain lakes have some characteristics, which can affect bacterioplankton communities significantly. There are some taxonomic groups of bacteria dominant in mountain lakes, such as the genus Polynucleobacter. These groups are also abundant in freshwater environments in low altitudes and regarded as cosmopolitans widely distributed in global freshwater environments. For some of these bacteria, their dominance in mountain lakes can be partially explained by their physiological characteristics. In addition to the environmental filtering illustrated by the dominance of these bacteria, community assembly of bacterioplankton in mountain lakes may also be regulated by other processes, including dispersal limitation and evolutionary constraint.

SPATIO-TEMPORAL RESPONSE OF SEDIMENTARY DIATOMS TO WATER LEVEL IN A SHALLOW LAKE	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												In recent years, human activities have resulted in variations of hydraulic conditions in shallow lakes, thereby affecting interactions between environmental variables and aquatic plants. This feedback of plants on environmental changes is largely recorded in lake sediments. In this study we collected surface sediments in different seasons and a sediment core from a shallow lake Baiyangdian. We investigated the seasonal effects of water level and six physicochemical variables in surface sediments, as well as their impacts on the distribution of diatom assemblages. Therein the response of diatom assemblages to water level and the spatio-temporal effects of water level are highly emphasized. Results indicate that water level significantly changes between seasons, however there is no significant seasonal effects for the composition of grain size. The lake productivity increases with the vigorous growth of aquatic plants. Water level largely determines the distribution of diatom assemblages in surface sediments and the sediment core. Spatial isolation causes the difference between the habitats and alters the relation between water level and diatom taxa. Human activities also affect the relevance of water level with diatom assemblage. The results can provide the helpful information for the local water resource management.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2016	14	2					151	168		10.15666/aeer/1402_151168	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1402_151168													WOS:000375222100011

Guide to the littoral zone vascular flora of Carolina bay lakes (USA)	BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL												Background Carolina bays are elliptic, directionally aligned basins of disputed origin that occur on the Atlantic Coastal Plain from the Delmarva Peninsula to southern Georgia. In southeastern North Carolina, several large, natural, lacustrine systems (i.e., Carolina bay lakes) exist within the geomorphological features known as Carolina bays. Within the current distribution of Carolina bays, Bladen and Columbus counties (North Carolina) contain the only known examples of Carolina bay lakes. The Carolina bay lakes can be split into two major divisions, the "Bladen Lakes Group" which is characterized as being relatively unproductive (dystrophic - oligotrophic),and Lake Waccamaw, which stands alone in Columbus County and is known for its high productivity and species richness. Although there have been several studies conducted on these unique lentic systems, none have documented the ora comprehensively. New information Over the 2013 2014 growing seasons, the littoral zone ora of Carolina bay lakes was surveyed and vouchered. Literature reviews and herbarium crawls complemented this fieldwork to produce an inventory of the vascular plant species. This survey detected 205 taxa (species/subspecies and varieties) in 136 genera and 80 vascular plant families. Thirty-one species (15.2%) are of conservation concern. Lake Waccamaw exhibited the highest species richness with 145 catalogued taxa and 26 species of conservation concern. Across all sites, the Cyperaceae (25 spp.), Poaceae (21 spp.), Asteraceae (13 spp.), Ericaceae (8 spp.), Juncaceae (8 spp.), and Lentibulariaceae (6 spp.) were the six most species-rich vascular plant families encountered. A guide to the littoral zone ora of Carolina bay lakes is presented herein, including dichotomous keys, species accounts (including abundance, habitat, phenology, and exsiccatae), as well as images of living species and vouchered specimens.																			1314-2836	1314-2828					2016	4								e7964	10.3897/BDJ.4.e7964	http://dx.doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.4.e7964								27350764					WOS:000449618200085
J	Jiang, H				Jiang, Hui			RETRIEVAL OF WATER TRANSPARENCY BASED ON LANDSAT 7 ETM+ DATA IN POYANG LAKE	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												Monitoring water transparency trends is important for understanding and managing lakes. Remote sensing based methods are well suited to monitoring the transparency of large inland lakes with seasonal and dynamic patterns, such as Poyang Lake. This paper explores the potential of using imagery from the Landsat7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) sensor to study spatiotemporal transparency variations in seasonal lakes. Seasonal piecewise retrieval models for water transparency were constructed using both Secchi disk depths (SDD) recorded in situ and Landsat7 ETM+ images of Poyang Lake in different periods. Water transparency was retrieved with piecewise regression methods in flood, average, and dry periods by SDD values in situ and BLUE band(ETM1), RED band(ETM3), near-infrared band(ETM4), and a combination of these bands. These methods can construct the optimum inversion model with water transparency. The RED band is the most sensitive band. We obtained the best results, as well as the exponential regression model, with the reflectance value of ETM3 minus ETM1 (R-2=0.762, RMSE=12.1) in the flood period, the logarithm model with the reflectance of ETM3(R-2=0.750, RMSE=14.3) in the average water period, and the logarithm model with the sum of ETM3 and ETM4(R-2=0.849, RMSE=8.3) in the dry period. The piecewise method can efficiently improve the accuracy of transparency detection for seasonal lakes in all periods. The R-2 of each piecewise model is higher than the model of all samples in the three periods. The accuracy of these models is within 30%, the average relative error is within 16.0%, and the inversion results are ideal. This study suggests that water transparency images developed with Landsat7 ETM+ imagery and water transparency data may be useful tools for water resource managers concerned with SDD variations in large inland lakes.																			1018-4619	1610-2304					2016	25	12A					6151	6158																WOS:000392555800064

The major and trace element chemistry of fish and lake water within major South African catchments	WATER SA												Chemical elements in lake water are incorporated into fish tissues through bioconcentration and biomagnification. Lake water and fish tissue samples from 23 lakes, located within 4 major South African catchments, were analysed to investigate the link between element concentrations in lake water and otolith, fin spine, muscle, liver and gill tissues. The comparison is complicated by the seasonal variation in water chemistry as well as the large natural variation between individual fish within a lake. Comparisons between fish from different lakes can also only be done within the same species, which may not occur within all the lakes within the project area. This may be further complicated by erratic anthropogenic contamination. It is therefore more successful to use inter-element ratios for comparison than absolute element concentrations. Using the Sr/Ca elemental ratio, a species-specific correlation was identified between lake water, otolith, fin spine and gill tissue samples. The best discrimination between fish species was achieved using a Na/Ca versus Mg/Ca elemental ratio diagram of gill tissues. The best discrimination between fish from different lakes was achieved using a Ba/Mg versus Sr/Mg elemental ratio diagram for fin spine tissue.					; Huizenga, Jan Marten/A-9637-2012; Huizenga, Jan/A-9637-2012; Wepener, Victor/AAV-2116-2020	Wepener, Victor/0000-0002-9374-7191; Huizenga, Jan Marten/0000-0003-3254-702X; 													0378-4738	1816-7950				JAN	2016	42	1					112	128		10.4314/wsa.v42i1.12	http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/wsa.v42i1.12													WOS:000369571400012

The five most abundant species accounted for 53.6% of the total catch and comprised Clupeicthys aesarnensis, Rasbora borapetensis, Barbonymus gonionotus, Esomus metallicus and Oreochromis niloticus. Total larval abundance and species richness varied among sampling months but did not vary with zones in the reservoir. The abundance and species richness of fish larvae showed correlation with flooding, vegetation cover, water level, water temperature and turbidity. A self-organising map (SOM) was used to represent the larval fish assemblage patterns and three assemblage patterns were clearly distinguished primarily according to seasons. In conclusion, the fish larval abundance was greatest during the wet season and the most diverse assemblages were found in the zones adjacent to the connected river upstream during the wet season.

We evaluated two water plant species (common reed, narrow-leaved cattail) as potential indicators or accumulators of trace elements in water reservoirs in city areas. Higher cadmium concentration was noted in the lake and lake outflow, especially in April. While in the case of lead higher concentrations were recorded in the river on the lake outflow, which can be caused by lead release from lake sediments and water surface flow roads and industry area located nearby the lake. The contamination factor indicated a low or medium level for both elements. Accumulation of both heavy metals in plant materials was observed during the growing season in all plant organs. Higher levels of both heavy metals were noted for below ground organs, which may suggest water as a main source of these elements.

Soil-Plant Relationships in the Sabkhat of America	SABKHA ECOSYSTEMS VOL V: THE AMERICAS	Tasks for Vegetation Science											In Sabkhat, plant ecology will depend on the soil characteristics, according to the type and dynamics of sediments and to water movement, dynamized by salt concentration and climate. Soil profile defines the ability of species to develop under its influence, according to critical variables such as soil salinity, water table depth and granulometry. Also, plant growth and development will depend on special physiological and morphological characteristics that are suited to extreme conditions in sabkhat. In America, sabkhat are the habitat of halophytic species, dwelling characteristic genera that can be found from the Columbia Basin to the Monte ecoregion. In this review soil conditions, plant characteristics and their interactions in saline basins of America will be discussed. Hydrology controls the sediment and solute chemistry, forming a dynamic cycle with halophyte vegetation. When the water table is depressed, deflation is enabled and medium-coarse particles are deposited over small hummocks, usually by the form of dunes or over tussocks, forming nabkhat. Aeolian dust may be responsible for the development and maintenance of plant communities along a salinity gradient towards the adjacent dunes in the periphery. Sabkhat hold an important pool of plant functional groups according mainly to soil salinity and water table depth. Such functional groups perform important ecological functions in the soil-plant-climate triad, such as soil formation, facilitation and zonation. These processes have a dynamic behaviour according to seasonality and climate interannual and decadal variability, assisted by anthropic impacts such as fire, overgrazing or even climatic change.

Examination of seasonal variations and correlation coefficients calculated among the parameters showed that settling biological material was an important carrier phase, especially for Cr, Cu, Pb, Fe, and Mn. The metals and nutrients in the lake could come from the same pollution sources. According to the C:N:P ratios of the sediments, it was discovered that biologic materials originated from algae population and domestic and industrial wastewaters. Iron and manganese cycling was also a contributor to trace element transport, while calcium carbonate formations were determined to be inefficient carrier material.					; KARAER, FEZA/AAH-3984-2021; HACISALİHOĞLU, Saadet/KGL-1554-2024	Hacisalihoglu, Saadet/0000-0001-5969-4180; 													1527-5922	1527-5930					2016	17	3					263	273		10.1080/15275922.2016.1177751	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15275922.2016.1177751													WOS:000386682400007

The coastal landslide, with a length of 94 m and a width of 55 m, had a volume of about 30,500 m 3 of sandy to gravelly till. It was likely triggered by a significant amount of water infiltration caused by a heavy rain coincident with an accelerated snow melt. The displaced mass spread on the lake floor and triggered a tsunami that broke and partly lifted the ice cover. Water and ice damaged several seasonal residences and boathouses on the periphery of the lake, in an area extending 450 m north and 500 m south of the landslide debris location. Observations on aerial photographs taken shortly after the event revealed the existence of radial structures on the ice cover in the affected area resulting from the evolution of the tsunami wave. Investigations carried out on east and west shores showed evidences of net marks on tree trunks explained by a maximum inundation height which can be as much as 1.8 m directly in front of the landslide position on the west shore.																					978-3-319-20979-1				2016	41						607	614		10.1007/978-3-319-20979-1_61	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-20979-1_61													WOS:000381724100061

Variability and trends in streamflow in northeast United States	FOURTH ITALIAN WORKSHOP ON LANDSLIDES	Procedia Earth and Planetary Science				4th Italian Workshop on Landslides	NOV 23-26, 2015	Naples, ITALY					There is general consensus that climate is undergoing change but whether climate change is occurring or not is still being debated in certain scientific, political, and religious quarters. Hydrologic variability influences the design of civil works and assessment of long-term climate change would help improve design criteria. To this end, long-term variability of streamflow was estimated using Shannon entropy. Three statistical tests were applied to determine trends in annual and seasonal daily streamflow with 5% two-sided confidence limit. Daily streamflow data spanning 70 years (from 1943 to 2012) from 669 stream gauge stations located in 23 states in the northeastern part of United States of America, covering six different water regions were employed. The time variability of annual and seasonal daily streamflow was assessed using the Mean Decadal Apportionment Disorder Index (MDADI). Analysis showed that in all cases minimum and maximum streamflows had higher variability than average and median streamflows. A significant number of stations exhibited trends. Considering annual minimum, average and median daily streamflows, approximately 50% of the stations followed trends and for almost all these stations trendswere increasing. Only for annual maximum daily streamflow, 15% of the stations showed increasing trend and 10% decreasing trend. In terms of geographical distribution, the stations with increasing trend were essentially located along the Atlantic coast and near Great Lakes and in the Upper Mississippi Water Region. Similar considerations apply for seasonal time series as well. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Developing a lake management strategy by dovetailing lake monitoring with paleolimnological techniques: a case study from a kettle lake on the Oak Ridges Moraine (Ontario, Canada)	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												In response to concerns about declining water quality, increased aquatic plant biomass, and harmful algal blooms, a lake monitoring program was undertaken on a suburban kettle lake near Toronto, Canada. We identified environmental conditions consistent with eutrophication, and the largest source of phosphorus (P) loading was from sediment release during an extended period of low dissolved oxygen during thermal stratification of the water column. To put these current environmental conditions in perspective, account for long-term limnological trends, and develop a sustainable lake management strategy, we also undertook paleolimnological analysis of a sediment core. Using diatoms as proxy indicators, historic limnological conditions were reconstructed. Although pre-European settlement conditions were typical of lakes with forested catchments in this region, the lake was mesotrophic (total phosphorus [TP] similar to 17.5 mu g/L), likely from P bound to dissolved organic carbon. P concentrations increased with the use of chemical fertilizers and establishment of seasonal lakeside cottages and resorts starting in the 1920s (the beginning of the diatom-inferred (DI-) TP upward trend). With the conversion of these cottages into year-round homes (since 1960) and further urbanization of the catchment, including servicing with municipal water supply but continued reliance on septic tanks, P has increased further (TP similar to 26.1 mu g/L). For restoration to a sustainable state, methods of preventing sediment P release (capping the sediment surface or oxygenation of the hypolimnion) should be considered, along with installation of municipal wasterwater servicing and stewardship projects to prevent further P loading from septic systems and surface runoff.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2016	32	3					234	245		10.1080/10402381.2016.1167148	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2016.1167148													WOS:000382447600003

REPRODUCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF NORTHERN PIKE, ESOX LUCIUS (ACTINOPTERYGII: ESOCIFORMES: ESOCIDAE), IN THE ANZALI WETLAND, SOUTHWEST CASPIAN SEA	ACTA ICHTHYOLOGICA ET PISCATORIA												Background. Temporal variability in fish reproductive features is influenced by environmental and spatial variations. Given the wide distribution of northern pike, Esox lucius Linnaeus, 1758, in the northern hemisphere, important reproductive features such as the initiation of the spawning activity are likely to vary with latitudinal gradients. The overall goal of the presently reported study was to answer basic questions regarding the reproductive biology of the pike and to discuss changes in the timing of the onset of spawning activity in relation to geographical locations and the water temperature in the Anzali Wetland compared to higher latitudes. Materials and methods. Monthly samples (537 specimens in total) were collected from the Anzali Wetland (southwest of the Caspian Sea) from July 2012 through July 2013. Samples were macro- and microscopically examined, and their maturity stages were identified, so that spawning season, monthly distribution of maturity stages, oocytes development, spawning strategy, length at 50% maturity, and fecundity were estimated. Results. The gonadosomatic index, oocyte size-frequency distribution, and histological examination suggested a relatively short spawning season, from February through March. The short annual spawning period and the oocyte size-frequency distribution demonstrated that pike is a total spawner with group synchronous oocyte development. The length at 50% maturity was 28.5 and 33.9 cm FL for males and females, respectively. Absolute fecundity values ranged from 4423 to 48 471 oocytes, with mean (+/- standard error) of 16 481 +/- 2705 oocytes and the relative fecundity was estimated as 26.9 +/- 1.6 oocytes per gram of mature female. Conclusion. The most important findings of this study are: the earlier initiation and relatively shorter duration of the reproductive activities of pike in the south Caspian region compared to northern geographical regions. The results emphasize the need for specific management strategies based on seasonal measures for pike such as: fish size limits, limitation of catches during the spawning season, limitation of the boat number, and closure of the spawning area during spawning months.

Quantifying Groundwater Export from an Urban Reservoir: A Case Study from Coastal South Carolina	EMERGING ISSUES IN GROUNDWATER RESOURCES	Advances in Water Security											Climatic and anthropogenic factors can have a significant influence on groundwater resources, calling into question the future quality and quantity of the commodity. In this chapter, we discuss current and emerging issues concerning groundwater scarcity. These concepts are demonstrated using a case study from an urban reservoir that serves as a stormwater conduit to the nearshore ocean. Quantitative estimates of groundwater interaction with the reservoir were determined via direct tracer techniques which are rarely, if ever, used by urban hydrologists. Continuous time-series records of dissolved Rn-222 were collected to evaluate the volumetric percentage of groundwater within the reservoir from 2012 through 2013. Using high-resolution sampling, we are able to characterize groundwater and reservoir response on event and seasonal time scales, while also offering general assessments of the hydrologic conditions during the study. When rainfall was not occurring, evapotranspiration served as the primary driver of overall hydrologic characteristics, directly influencing the water table and subsequent groundwater discharged from the reservoir. However, during storm events, hydrologic factors influencing the amount of groundwater within the reservoir were found to be more complex, including event duration, magnitude, and antecedent conditions. Seasonally, rainfall patterns were largely responsible for the magnitude of groundwater present within the reservoir and quasi-related to peak export to the coastal ocean. Most notably, we observed a decline in the volumetric percentage of groundwater within the reservoir as a result of increased groundwater residence time within the aquifer-a likely function of reduced aquifer recharge that would result from more efficient stormwater management.																					978-3-319-32008-3; 978-3-319-32006-9				2016							223	262		10.1007/978-3-319-32008-3_9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-32008-3_9	10.1007/978-3-319-32008-3												WOS:000404570100010

Samples for phytoplankton analyses were collected twice a month, using plankton net and sampling bottles. At same time, by using portable field devices and Secchi disk, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity and transparency were measured. A total of 153 taxa of the phytoplankton (27 taxa of cyanobacteria and 126 of algae) were documented in the studied ponds. The most abundant phytoplankton was in Sumicky horni pond, in which big fluctuation in abundance was recorded over the study period. Cyanobacteria, over the entire year, were the most dominant group in this pond. Main representatives were from genera Microcystis. In Sumicky dolni pond the most numerous were the green algae, with the genera Desmodesmus, Pediastrum, Scenedesmus and Crucigenia tetrapedia, which was the most abundant species in July and August. In Pohorelicky pond, after a short period at the beginning of the season when low diversity and number of phytoplankton was documented, a dominance of green algae occurred, subsequently followed by the dominance of trichal cyanobacteria Planktothrix agardhii, Cuspidothrix issatschenkoi and Aphanizomenon flos-aqua.

These wetlands were constructed to mitigate flooding of the Trinity River, but also provided quality wildlife habitat and removal of wastewater effluent contaminants. Variations in life history were observed between two macrophytes and three different wetlands of varying age, effluent source, and vegetation establishment. Mean annual production of E. civile was 1393 mg/m(2)/year, standing stock biomass was 1376 mg/m(2)/year, cohort production/biomass (P/B) ratio was 4.30/year, and annual P/B was 10.18/year. These values are in the upper range of known Odonata production values from a lentic system. Enallagma civile biomass growth rates were observed to be higher from populations on the better established macrophyte (Potamogeton nodosus Poiret, 1816) and in the longest established wetland.

The freshwater grass shrimp Palaemonetes antennarius in the diet of fish in Lake Bracciano (Central Italy)	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												We evaluated the importance of the freshwater grass shrimp Palaemonetes antennarius as trophic source for the lacustrine fish of the Lake Bracciano (Central Italy) analyzing 6120 stomach contents of 10 species. Shrimp was recorded for all size classes of the investigated species with a variation in frequency and abundance depending on seasons. P. antennarius was occasionally preyed by cyprinids, and systematically by small individuals of carnivorous fish. Our findings acquire more importance if we take the shrimps ecological niche into account, as it is potentially acting as detritivorous/generalist and predator of benthic invertebrates as well. This feeding behavior makes P. antennarius an important network ring, being a taxon that ought to receive the same attention recommended for other freshwater decapods as proposed for Austropotamobius pallipes and Potamon fluviatile.					; Doerr, Ambrosius/G-9915-2014	SCALICI, Massimiliano/0000-0002-5677-8837; Doerr, Ambrosius/0000-0002-2768-3783													1961-9502						2016		417							7	10.1051/kmae/2015040	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/kmae/2015040													WOS:000390394000012

Firstly, the available MODIS images of transplanting and heading stages were assured in accordance with the schedules of local traditional paddy fields tillage in 2010, and then time-series NDVI images were smoothed by Harmonic Analysis of Time Series (HANTS) algorithm to remove the noise and the atmospheric effects. Secondly, the spatial distribution and planting acreage of three types of rice were derived from combining the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) according to the water background and variation characteristics of NDVI values at transplanting and heading stages. Finally, the accuracy evaluation was performed by the statistical data. The results showed that three types of rice were mainly distributed along the Dongting Lake Basin in Hunan Province and the relative errors were -10.99 %, 1.46 %, -5.87 %, respectively.					huang, lin/OIU-2389-2025; Zhang, Dongyan/KJL-2003-2024														1865-0929	1865-0937	978-3-662-49155-3; 978-3-662-49154-6				2016	569						559	565		10.1007/978-3-662-49155-3_58	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-49155-3_58													WOS:000373275200058
J	Lockhart, C; Austin, DF; Aumen, NG				Lockhart, C; Austin, DF; Aumen, NG			Water level effects on growth of Melaleuca seedlings from Lake Okeechobee (Florida, USA) littoral zone	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The invasive exotic wetland tree, Melaleuca quinquenervia, is expanding rapidly throughout seasonally wet areas of southern Florida (USA), including the littoral zone of Lake Okeechobee. Natural resource managers are concerned that a lower lake level regulation schedule under consideration for Lake Okeechobee, while potentially beneficial to overall ecosystem health, might increase the rate of Melaleuca expansion. To investigate this possibility, Melaleuca saplings (harvested from the littoral zone) and 7-week-old seedlings (grown from harvested seeds) were subjected to various hydroperiod treatments in replicated mesocosms. hydroperiod treatments were selected based on a simulation of historical water level variations. Saplings grew taller under longer hydroperiods with fluctuating water levels, including periods of submersion. Time Since germination affected the response of seedlings to inundation. Submersed 7-week-old seedlings grew slower and had less biomass than submersed 12-week-old seedlings, yet mortality was low at both ages. Melaleuca's plasticity allows it to adapt to hypoxic, aquatic conditions by means of aquatic heterophylly and adventitious roots. Algae and drought also increased mortality. Based on faster growth of Melaleuca under longer hydroperiods and its adaptability to seasonal flooding. a lower lake regulation schedule may not stimulate its expansion. Therefore, water levels should not be manipulated only to control Melaleuca. Control of Melaleuca should continue using current practices such as manual removal or chemical treatment.																			0364-152X					MAY	1999	23	4					507	518											10085383					WOS:000079382800009
J	SMITH, EH				SMITH, EH			BENCH-SCALE TESTS AND MODELING OF ADSORPTION OF NATURAL ORGANIC-MATTER BY ACTIVATED CARBON	WATER RESEARCH												Adsorption equilibria for activated carbon removal of natural organic matter (NOM) were obtained for a lake water, a leaf extract humic material and a sample from a monitoring well serving a municipal solid waste landfill. A multicomponent model incorporating ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) and a non-adsorbable fraction more accurately described equilibrium data for the overall isotherm than a Freundlich single component isotherm model, and adequately simulated isotherms for variable initial concentration of the water as represented by a lumped parameter. A methodology is described for estimating equilibrium parameters for multiple hypothetic components that requires fewer parameter searches and is thus less computationally demanding than some other modeling schemes using IAST. The acquired equilibrium information was subsequently used to calibrate a dynamic, fixed-bed model in accordance with bench scale column data for the lake water. Rate parameters evaluated therein were used to predict breakthrough profiles in bench-scale columns of greater bed depth. Generally speaking, dynamic modeling which incorporated the multicomponent equilibrium approach provided more accurate description and prediction of NOM breakthrough profiles than a single component modeling scheme. The multicomponent approach was better able to simulate both the slow approach to exhaustion in the bed and the effects of changes in influent concentration. Although not fully representative of a full-scale system operating over a lengthy time period, the exercise gives insight into dynamic and modeling phenomena which may accompany seasonal variations in natural water quality.																			0043-1354					AUG	1994	28	8					1693	1702		10.1016/0043-1354(94)90240-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(94)90240-2													WOS:A1994NR03100002

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data enable timely monitoring of river ice conditions in inclement weather. River ice types and open water are discriminated during breakup using dual-polarized (HH & HV; DPH) and compact polarimetric (CP) C-band SAR imagery from the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM). Study areas comprise nineteen locations on rivers in northern Ontario, the Northwest Territories, and Alberta, Canada. Rubble ice, sheet ice, and open water areas are sampled in RCM imagery using corroborating evidence from shoreline cameras and oblique airborne photography. Samples are obtained in the incidence angle range 19 degrees to 48 degrees, for open water with various wind speeds and flow conditions, and for rubble ice and sheet ice with varying surface roughness, snow cover, and wetness. Discrimination relies on a primary classification of rubble ice, sheet ice, and open water, and a secondary classification of ice roughness. The primary classification model development uses a recursive-partitioning machine-learning technique. Overall accuracies for the best DPH models are 83.8% to 89.6%, depending on image noise floor. DPH models use both HH and HV polarizations for low noise floor image modes, whereas only HH is used for higher noise floor image modes. The best CP model accuracy is 90.2%, using the RL, RR, and RVRH parameters. Secondary classification associates increasing ice roughness with increasing HH backscatter for DPH data, and with increasing RH backscatter for CP data. The angular dependencies of rubble ice or sheet ice are used to normalize backscatter, which is then divided into roughness categories. The DPH and CP classification models are named IceBC-DP and IceBC-CP, respectively. Qualitative analysis illustrates good overall ice type and open water classification. Confounding situations are mixed pixel issues, whitewater and wind roughening of water, moist snow microwave absorption, and superficial water on sheet ice. The development of robust methods for monitoring ice jam formation with RCM is an operational concern for departments within the Government of Canada and within Provincial and Territorial Governments.																			0034-4257	1879-0704				OCT 1	2024	312								114313	10.1016/j.rse.2024.114313	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2024.114313		JUL 2024											WOS:001278157400001

The present study was carried out to assess the possible influences of aquaculture on a wild fish species, silverperch, Terapon plumbeus Kner, with a special emphasis on the feeding ecology of this fish. For the purposes of the investigation, 24-h samples were taken at 2-month intervals close to a fish-pen as well as in open water over a one-year period to acquire more information on this species. Significant differences in standard length and total weight were found between stations and sampling months. In open water, a mean standard length of 53.6 mm and a mean total weight of 4.2 g were found, whereas close to the fish-pen, the corresponding values were 57.6 mm and 5.4 g, respectively. The maximum mean standard length was attained around December 1996 and February 1997 (59.5 mm in open water; 66.1 mm close to the fish-pen), and the minimum was found in June 1996 (49.1 mm in open water; 46.2 mm close to the fishpen). Noticeable differences were found in the food spectrum between the two sampling stations. Zooplankton, the major food source at both stations, was more important in the stomach content of fish in open water. The same was true for insects (i.e. chironomid larvae), although these did not make up such a large fraction of the diet. On the other hand, close to the fish-pen, aufwuchs-algae, phytoplankton and fish were more important. Generally, benthic organisms were consumed more frequently close to the fish-pen. Zooplankton was more important in the diet of smaller fish. In all size groups, the importance of zooplankton decreased during the rainy season.

J	EADIE, BJ; MOREHEAD, NR; LANDRUM, PF				EADIE, BJ; MOREHEAD, NR; LANDRUM, PF			3-PHASE PARTITIONING OF HYDROPHOBIC ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS IN GREAT-LAKES WATERS	CHEMOSPHERE												Great Lakes waters were freshly collected, innoculated with radiolabelled hydrophobic organic compounds and, after equilibration, separated into particle bound, dissolved organic matter bound and freely dissolved phases. In these ambient suspended matter (0.2-5 ppm) and dissolved organic carbon (1-6 ppm) media, the freely dissolved phase generally dominates and the amounts associated with dissolved organic matter rarely exceeds 5% for most compounds. Solubility controls the constitutent distribution between particle bound and freely dissolved but plays a much smaller role in mediating the binding to dissolved organic matter. Difference observed in the binding to dissolved and particulate organic matter support the need to consider the distribution of constituents among three phases. Although the concentration and composition of the substrate changes significantly, there is no apparent seasonal effect on the distribution of compounds among the three phases in the Great Lakes.

Measurements in August 1993 and September 1992 show that values are lowest in the early morning, and highest in the afternoon, ranging from a minimum of -63.1 at 03:30 on August 30, 1993 to a maximum of -47.5 at 15:30 on August 29, 1993. The minimum values were apparently caused by an enhanced CO2-H-2 methanogenesis pathway. The maximum values occur when the CO2 pool decreases and acetic acid fermentation becomes relatively more important. Seasonal variation and seasonal variations in the magnitude of the diurnal variations in the delta(13)CH(4) value may depend on temperature and the day-to-night time ratio, of the diurnal cycle.																			0016-7037					FEB	1995	59	3					557	561		10.1016/0016-7037(94)00369-W	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(94)00369-W													WOS:A1995QG55800012
J	HARGROVE, JW				HARGROVE, JW			TOWARDS A GENERAL RULE FOR ESTIMATING THE STAGE OF PREGNANCY IN FIELD-CAUGHT TSETSE-FLIES	PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												Ovarian dissections were performed on the tsetse flies Glossina morsitans morsitans Westwood and G.pallidipes Austen of known ages, maintained in the laboratory or on an island in Lake Kariba, Zimbabwe. The lengths (I-2 and l(u)) of the second largest oocyte and of the larva in utero were found to increase approximately exponentially during pregnancy. The length (l(1)) of the largest oocyte increased exponentially for about the first 80% of pregnancy. Linear relationships between the log values of l(1), I-2 and l(u) in field-caught flies, of unknown chronological age, are consistent with the idea that growth patterns are similar in laboratory, island and open field situations. The egg phase takes up c. 45% of pregnancy in both species, regardless of season and the absolute duration of pregnancy. The changes in the log values of l(1), l(2) and l(u), over the ranges within which they change linearly, can be used to assign flies to their stage of pregnancy. When applied to field data the rule showed that G.pallidipes caught in odour-baited traps, and on a mobile electric net, exhibited major activity peaks shortly before and after parturition. Flies from the trap (but not the net) showed a smaller peak of activity near the middle of pregnancy. The egg and the three larval phases in utero take up c. 45%, 25%, 20% and 10% of pregnancy respectively.																			0307-6962					SEP	1995	20	3					213	223		10.1111/j.1365-3032.1995.tb00004.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3032.1995.tb00004.x													WOS:A1995TH68100004

J	Holmes, JA				Holmes, JA			Recent non-marine Ostracoda from Jamaica, West Indies	JOURNAL OF MICROPALAEONTOLOGY												Ostracods were sampled qualitatively at 22 sites from 15 waterbodies in the western part of Jamaica and determinations of the water chemistry and habitat characteristics were made at each locality. Most of the ostracods found belong to the Cypridinae, Cypridopsinae, Cyclocypridinae and Darwinulidae. There is a clear distinction between the faunas found in the larger, permanent lakes and the smaller ponds. The latter are subject to large fluctuations in volume and may desiccate either seasonally or interannually. Within the largest lake, Wallywash Great Pond, there is some degree of spatial zonation in the ostracod faunas that appears to be related to water depth and aquatic macrophyte occurrence. The distribution of modern ostracods within Wallywash Great Pond suggests that the late Quaternary faunal sequence from this lake is primarily a function of lake-level changes.																			0262-821X					OCT	1997	16		2				137	143		10.1144/jm.16.2.137	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/jm.16.2.137													WOS:A1997YC15900006
J	Townsend, SA; LuongVan, JT; Boland, KT				Townsend, SA; LuongVan, JT; Boland, KT			Retention time as a primary determinant of colour and light attenuation in two tropical Australian reservoirs	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The light climates of Darwin River Reservoir (DRR) and Manton River Reservoir (MRR) in northern Australia, are compared for an 8-year period. The reservoirs are subject to the same wet/dry tropical climate and have similar catchment characteristics, but differ in their basin morphology, retention time and trophic status. 2. Median euphotic depths in DRR and MRR were 9.7 and 4.4 m, respectively. Seasonal variation in each reservoir's euphotic depth was best explained by colour, based on a stepwise linear regression. Turbidity was excluded from the two regressions, while chlorophyll a concentration was significant only for the MRR regression. 3. Both reservoirs showed the same seasonal pattern for colour. Wet season inflow increased reservoir colour, and was followed by a reduction in colour due to photodegradation and microbial decomposition of humic material, reaching a minimum before the next wet seasons inflow. 4. Although the colour of catchment run-off into both reservoirs was similar, MRR colour was two to three times greater than that measured in DRR. The higher colour and greater light attenuation of MRR is attributed primarily to its shorter retention time, and therefore shorter time for colour removal. Annual retention time accounted for 97% of the variability of average annual colour (measured as absorption at 440 nm), based on a linear regression of log(10) transformed data for both reservoirs. 5. Long retention times favour reduced colour, increasing water transparency, particularly in water bodies of low trophic state and inorganic turbidity.																			0046-5070					AUG	1996	36	1					57	69		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1996.00072.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1996.00072.x													WOS:A1996VB54100007
J	Håkanson, L; Boulion, VV				Håkanson, L; Boulion, VV			Modelling production and biomasses of herbivorous and predatory zooplankton in lakes	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												This work presents a dynamic model to predict two fundamental functional categories of zooplankton in lakes, herbivorous and predatory zooplankton. The model has been developed as an integral part within the framework of a more comprehensive lake ecosystem model, LakeWeb, which also accounts for phytoplankton, bacterioplankton, two types of fish (prey and predatory), as well as zoobenthos, macrophytes and benthic algae. The new model is based on ordinary differential equations. the ecosystem scale and gives seasonal variations (the calculation time is I week). It is meant to account for all important factors regulating the production and biomass of zooplankton and the predation on zooplankton in lakes. The model has not been calibrated and tested in the traditional way using data from a few well investigated lakes. Instead, it has been tested using empirical regressions based on data from many lakes. We have also presented new data sets and regressions based on those data for zooplankton. The basic aim of the dynamic model is that it should capture general functional and structural patterns in lakes. We have demonstrated by several model tests along limnological gradients (total phosphorus concentrations, pH, lake colour, latitude and lake size) that the new model gives predictions that agree well with the values given by the empirical regressions, and also expected and requested divergences from these regressions when they do not provide sufficient resolution. It would have been very difficult indeed to carry out such tests regarding ecosystem responses using traditional methods with extensive field studies in a few lakes. We have given algorithms for (1) production of herbivorous and predatory zooplankton, (2) elimination (related to the turnover time of zooplankton), (3) zooplankton consumption by prey fish, and the factors influencing these processes/rates, The model is driven by data easily accessed from standard monitoring programs or maps and meant to be of practical use in lake management.

J	HERMAN, TB; POWER, TD; EATON, BR				HERMAN, TB; POWER, TD; EATON, BR			STATUS OF BLANDING TURTLES, EMYDOIDEA-BLANDINGII, IN NOVA-SCOTIA, CANADA	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												Blanding's Turtle, Emydoidea blandinsii, is a northern freshwater species with a distribution centered in the Great Lakes region. Numerous isolated populations exist along the periphery of the range; of these, the Nova Scotia population is the most isolated. Most individuals in the Nova Scotia population occur within Kejimkujik National Park in southwest Nova Scotia, where they are confined primarily to three centres of activity, all associated with darkly coloured waters and peaty soils. Capture-mark-recapture and radiotracking data show long-distance nesting migrations by females and exceptionally long overland movements by some males. This vagility, in combination with observations of promiscuous mating, suggests the Nova Scotia population is panmictic. Historical and recent records show that scattered individuals occur in low numbers outside the Park. The adult population within the Park is estimated to be 132 (95% confidence intervals: 99-179). Densities are substantially lower than those reported for other populations. The age structure in this population appears top-heavy, of 48 individuals aged, 31 exceeded 30 years. This suggests that longevity and reproductive lifespan are extended, but that recruitment is low. Reproductive potential is apparently compromised by: (i) the limited availability of suitable nesting areas (substrate, exposure, susceptibility to flooding); and (2) low egg and hatchling survivorship (due to raccoon predation, flooding and a short glowing season). These factors, in combination with late age at maturation, underline the importance of high survivorship of breeding adults to the continued existence of this population. The recommended status of the Nova Scotia Blanding's Turtle population is threatened.																			0008-3550					APR-JUN	1995	109	2					182	191																WOS:A1995TB34800003

Understanding the effect of the distribution of n-FAs and their hydrogen isotope composition (delta H-2(FA)) is critical for interpreting sedimentary delta H-2(FA) values as proxies of hydroclimate and/or vegetation changes. In this study, we systematically investigated the distribution of n-FAs and delta H-2(FA) values across seasons on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). Our results showed that there were no significant seasonal differences in n-FAs distribution and delta H-2(FA) values, but there were significant differences in delta H-2(FA) values across plant types. The delta H-2(FA) values ranged from -185 parts per thousand to -125 parts per thousand in dicots (-161 parts per thousand +/- 28 parts per thousand), and from -215 parts per thousand to -170 parts per thousand in monocots (-196 parts per thousand +/- 22 parts per thousand) on the CLP. Isotope fractionation between delta H-2(FA) values and precipitation delta H-2 (epsilon(FA-P)) was also H-2-enriched in dicots relative to monocots. At the regional scale of the CLP, delta H-2(FA) values were not correlated with delta H-2 values of precipitation. However, delta H-2(FA) values from the CLP were similar to expectations from a global comparison, both in terms of their mean values and high variability among plants growing in sites with similar delta H-2 values of precipitation. As some of this variability in epsilon(FA-P) is due to the effect of plant type, a careful assessment of the likely sources of waxes in terrestrial sediments is critical when using delta H-2(FA) values for paleohydroclimate reconstruction.

The life cycle and reproductive characteristics of this species throughout Indonesia are poorly known. This information is required to manage the species and mitigate against any negative effects that it might have on native ecosystems. We firstly report on the reproductive biology of S. pacifica by combined temporal monitoring, histological investigation, and light and scanning electron microscopy, and relate mussel densities, and their reproductive and embryological stages, to environmental variables at five sites in West Java from 67 to 1,580 m above sea level. Sinanodonta pacifica is protandrous and can spawn eggs and brood larvae throughout the year, with spawning peaks in the early rainy season from September to December. Mussels from midland sites brood 4.1-8.9-fold more glochidia than those from lowland or highland sites; highland and lowland sites produce 3.1-4.3-fold more hermaphrodites than midland sites. High levels of suspended solids and low chlorophyll-a concentrations contribute to a higher proportion of hermaphrodites and a decrease in glochidia production. Low mussel densities and an unbalanced sex ratio also contribute to increased proportions of hermaphrodites, and reduced glochidia production. These results improve our understanding of how S. pacifica recruits across elevations, and how population growth might threaten native species and natural ecosystems. Management involving periodic harvesting of mussels to control population size and promotion of economic benefits from pearl production is proposed.

Materials and methods Two field surveys (wet and dry seasons) were conducted at a total of 36 sites in the tributaries of Gehu Lake, located in a plain region in China. The European Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) extraction method was employed to analyze the components of Cd and Pb. The Nemello index and ecological risk index were calculated to assess their pollution levels and ecological risks. Results and discussion Cd primarily accumulated at the river mouths, while Pb was predominantly concentrated near the discharge sources. The mobile fractions of Cd were more likely to be released and migrate downstream, and thus the total Cd content demonstrated a significantly negative correlation with these mobile forms (p < 0.05). In contrast, although Pb had a greater proportion of mobile fractions, they were readily re-adsorbed onto particles and settled near the source. The source area displayed notable pollution with Pb, whereas the downstream river mouth area posed a high risk of Cd pollution. Conclusions The results indicated that the weak river hydrodynamics within plains amplify the impact of heavy metal mobility on their behaviors, producing a "screening effect" on Pb and Cd and resulting in distinct distribution patterns in sediments. These findings can guide the ecological risk assessment of heavy metals in aquatic ecosystems within plains.					wenqing, shi/JCO-4345-2023														1439-0108	1614-7480				JUL	2024	24	7					2848	2858		10.1007/s11368-024-03854-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-024-03854-2		JUL 2024											WOS:001263312700001

Our objective was to estimate the selectivity of whitefish fisheries in a large European lake through a collaboration of fishers, regional managers, and scientists. Fishers were given special permits to test, within a common framework and together with scientists, selectivity enhancement strategies adapted to their own experiences. Fishers and scientists jointly tested gillnets and pontoon traps and how fishing depth, soak time, fishing season, and mesh size were affected by bycatches of undersized fish of sensitive species. Results indicated that the selectivity of the fishery could be increased, particularly by targeting whitefish adjacent to spawning sites where spatiotemporal overlap with bycatch species was lower. Proposed changes to the fishery, such as new gear, would be costly initially but could become profitable over time due to a lower cost of handling bycatch. Our findings demonstrated that co-constructed knowledge can contribute to the governance of aquatic resources.

J	KINUTHIA, JH				KINUTHIA, JH			HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL STRUCTURE OF THE LAKE TURKANA JET	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY												An observational study was undertaken at selected sites in north Kenya (Turkana channel) in February 1983 and in June-July 1984 to investigate the horizontal and vertical extent of the Turkana low-level jet. Observations indicate that strong winds exist throughout the channel but speeds decreased where the channel became wider. Two distinct jet streams, detached from each other, exist throughout the channel except in Marsabit where they seem to have combined into a single, very high wind jet. Computations show that divergence is a predominant feature throughout the day but was more pronounced in the morning in both seasons. Anticyclonic and cyclonic vorticity existed in both seasons in the northern half and southern half of the channel, respectively, at lower levels. Finally, it is speculated that the Turkana jet could likely affect the easterly low-level jet in West Africa.																			0894-8763					NOV	1992	31	11					1248	1274		10.1175/1520-0450(1992)031<1248:HAVSOT>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0450(1992)031<1248:HAVSOT>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1992JV72800002
J	Chang, Y; Li, XD; Shu, LL; Ji, HJ				Chang, Yan; Li, Xiaodong; Shu, Lele; Ji, Haijuan			Comprehensive Hydrological Analysis of the Buha River Watershed with High-Resolution SHUD Modeling	WATER												This study utilizes the Simulator of Hydrologic Unstructured Domains (SHUD) model and the China Meteorological Forces Dataset (CMFD) to investigate the hydrological dynamics of the Buha River watershed, a critical tributary of Qinghai Lake, from 1979 to 2018. By integrating high-resolution terrestrial and meteorological data, the SHUD model simulates streamflow variations and other hydrological characteristics, providing valuable insights into the region's water balance and runoff processes. Key findings reveal a consistent upward trend in precipitation and temperature over the past four decades, despite minor deviations in daily precipitation intensity and relative humidity data. The SHUD model demonstrates high accuracy on a monthly scale, with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.72 for the calibration phase and 0.61 for the validation phase. The corresponding Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) values are 0.73 and 0.49, respectively, underscoring the model's applicability for hydrological forecasting and water resource management. Notably, the annual runoff ratios for the Buha River fluctuate annually between 0.11 and 0.21, with significant changes around 2007 correlating with a shift in Qinghai Lake's water levels. The analysis of water balance indicates a net leakage over long-term periods, with spatial alterations in leakage and replenishment along the river. Furthermore, snow accumulation, which increases with altitude, significantly contributes to streamflow during the melting season. Despite the Buha River basin's importance, research on its hydrology remains limited due to data scarcity and minimal human activity. This study enhances the understanding of the Buha River's hydrological processes and highlights the necessity for improved dataset accuracy and model parameter optimization in future research.					; Shu, Lele/U-9428-2019	Chang, Yan/0000-0001-7473-2915; Shu, Lele/0000-0002-6903-4466; 														2073-4441				JUL	2024	16	14							2015	10.3390/w16142015	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16142015													WOS:001277494200001

Black bullhead is one of the most successful invaders in European waters with several detrimental effects on native biota and ecosystems. In this study, we used stable isotope analysis to compare the body size and season-dependent diet, trophic position, isotopic niche size, and niche overlap of the invasive black bullhead with two native fish species (roach and European perch) in Lake Balaton, Hungary. We found that black bullhead could be characterized by invertivore-piscivorous feeding habit with a high rate of fish consumption. The rate of fish predation by invasive black bullhead increased with body size, while no seasonal differences were observed in fish consumption. Contrary to our hypothesis, little evidence of actual feeding competition was found between black bullhead and native fishes. Our results suggest that the studied species assimilate distinct energy resources in different proportions leading to a substantial amount of niche partitioning among them. We conclude that black bullhead may represent a threat for native, small-sized fishes primarily through predation and recommend urgent management actions (e.g. selective removal of the species) to minimize its adverse impacts on native communities.

Nevertheless, at the orbital scale, our current understanding about the characteristics and mechanisms of precipitation oxygen isotope (delta O-18(p)) variations in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) mid-latitudes remains limited due to the lack of abundant long-term geological records. In this study, based on a 300-ka transient simulation involving stable isotope fractionation processes, we systematically analyzed the characteristics of the orbital-scale delta O-18(p) variations and their potential mechanisms, especially in two representative regions: mid-latitude East Asia (MEA) and mid-latitude North America (MNA) located in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres respectively. Our findings reveal that the MEA delta O-18(p) is dominated by a 23-ka cycle, ultimately driven by the precession-induced insolation variation; while the MNA delta O-18(p) primarily exhibits a 100-ka glacial-interglacial cycle and is eventually governed by the ice volume forcing. The delta O-18(p) changes in these two regions not only present diverse dominant cycles and forcing factors, but also involve distinct physical processes. In MEA, water vapor transport by the westerly circulation during the rainy season (May-August) is the key process linking the April-July boreal insolation with the annual/rainy-season delta O-18(p) variations. In contrast, the annual delta O-18(p) changes in MNA mainly depend on the water vapor transport processes triggered by the expansion and retreat of the North American ice sheet, albeit with certain influence of the temperature effect as well. These results suggest that the dominant periodicities and forcing mechanisms of the orbital-scale delta O-18(p) variations across the NH mid-latitudes are complex and varied.

Limnological Characteristics and Relationships with Primary Productivity in Two High Andean Hydroelectric Reservoirs in Ecuador	WATER												Studies on limnology are essential to reservoir management; nevertheless, few are known about the limnological features of the Andean reservoirs in Ecuador. To overcome this limitation in the information, from December 2018 to December 2019, the limnological characteristics of El Labrado and Chanlud reservoirs in the Mach & aacute;ngara river basin (Ecuador south) were examined. Using the light/dark bottles technique, the primary productivity (PP) of phytoplankton was studied in conjunction with (1) vertical profiles of oxygen concentrations, water temperature, nitrogen, phosphorus, alkalinity, and heterotrophic bacteria; (2) Secchi disk transparency; and (3) meteorological factors such as wind force, precipitation, and water level. Data indicate that both reservoirs are polymictic, with alkaline waters, low nutrients, and low PP rates. Despite this, a principal component analysis revealed that Chanlud exhibits higher nitrogen, alkalinity, heterotrophic bacteria, and PP values. In two approaches through multiple linear regression analysis, each per reservoir, the PP was explained mainly by water temperature, depth, light, heterotrophic bacteria, and meteorological parameters. The low concentrations of nutrients and the low residency time explain the low PP values. Likewise, the altitudinal factor (i.e., both reservoirs are 3400 m above sea level) and the low human perturbations in surrounding reservoir zones play a crucial role in explaining their poor PP. Notwithstanding the low metabolic rates, clear seasonal trends were observed in both reservoirs; the lowest PP rates occurred during the cold season. To our knowledge, this is the first limnological study of high Andean reservoirs in Ecuador. These findings should be part of Andean reservoir management protocols, contributing significantly to local conservation efforts. Additionally, they could be extrapolated as a frame of reference to similar eco-hydrological systems.

Understanding bacterial communities within these lakes is crucial for assessing ecosystem health, biogeochemical cycling, and responses to environmental changes. In this study, we investigated the seasonal and vertical dynamics of both free-living (FL) and particle-attached (PA) bacteria in Lake Fuxian, a typical oligotrophic deep freshwater lake in southeast China. Our findings revealed distinct seasonal and vertical dynamics of FL and PA bacterial communities, driven by similar physiochemical environmental factors. PA bacteria exhibited higher alpha- and beta-diversity and were enriched with Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, Patescibacteria, Planctomycetota, and Verrucomicrobiota, while FL bacteria were enriched with Actinobacteria and Bacteroidota. FL bacteria showed enrichment in putative functions related to chemoheterotrophy and aerobic anoxygenic photosynthesis, whereas the PA fraction was enriched with intracellular parasites (mainly contributed by Rickettsiales, Chlamydiales, and Legionellales) and nitrogen metabolism functions. Deterministic processes predominantly shaped the assembly of both FL and PA bacterial communities, with stochastic processes playing a greater role in the FL fraction. Network analysis revealed extensive species interactions, with a higher proportion of positively correlated edges in the PA network, indicating mutualistic or cooperative interactions. Cyanobium, Comamonadaceae, and Roseomonas were identified as keystone taxa in the PA network, underscoring potential cooperation between autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria in organic particle microhabitats. Overall, the disparities in bacterial diversity, community composition, putative function, and network characteristics between FL and PA fractions highlight their adaptation to distinct ecological niches within these unique lake ecosystems.IMPORTANCEUnderstanding the diversity of microbial communities, their assembly mechanisms, and their responses to environmental changes is fundamental to the study of aquatic microbial ecology. Oligotrophic deep-water lakes are fragile ecosystems with limited nutrient resources, rendering them highly susceptible to environmental fluctuations. Examining different bacterial types within these lakes offers valuable insights into the intricate mechanisms governing community dynamics and adaptation strategies across various scales. In our investigation of oligotrophic deep freshwater Lake Fuxian in China, we explored the seasonal and vertical dynamics of two bacterial types: free-living (FL) and particle-attached (PA). Our findings unveiled distinct patterns in the diversity, composition, and putative functions of these bacteria, all shaped by environmental factors. Understanding these subtleties provides insight into bacterial interactions, thereby influencing the overall ecosystem functioning. Ultimately, our research illuminates the adaptation and roles of FL and PA bacteria within these unique lake environments, contributing significantly to our broader comprehension of ecosystem stability and health.

Analysis of vertical gradients of solutes near the sediment-water interface indicates that sulfate reduction and base cation production were the major mechanisms of alkalinity generation. A comparison of surficial accumulation rates and burial rates indicates that the major source of cations to the pore water occurred by release of organically bound and exchangeable cations through decomposition. Pore-water measurements also reveal significant seasonal changes in solute fluxes, including a sudden change in sediment metabolism following a springtime algal bloom. Spatial differences in particle deposition caused pore-water fluxes of ammonium and alkalinity to be almost an order of magnitude higher at a hypolimnetic site than at epilimnetic sites. After 2 yr of acidification, pore-water gradients of sulfate, calcium, and alkalinity showed only minor changes, and the pore-water pH in the acidified basin remained within 0.5 pH units of preacidification pH.

An open-source refactoring of the Canadian Small Lakes Model for estimates of evaporation from medium-sized reservoirs	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT												Eddy covariance (EC) is one of the most effective ways to directly observe evaporation from a lake surface. However, the deployment of EC systems on lakes is costly and technically challenging, which engenders a need for accurate modelling of evaporation from reservoirs for effective management. This study aims to (1) refactor the Canadian Small Lakes Model (CSLM) into modern high-level programming languages in open-source repositories and (2) evaluate evaporation estimates from the CSLM using 9 years of EC observations of a pit lake in Northern Alberta. The CSLM is a 1-D physical lake model simulating a mixing layer and an arbitrary thick skin layer which interfaces with the atmosphere and includes a module for ice dynamics. It was developed to interface with the Canadian global coupled models as part of the surface classification scheme and thus utilizes widely accessible forcing data. In this study the CSLM evaporation estimates are also compared to a commonly used bulk transfer method of estimating evaporation. In general, the CSLM had smaller open-water season error (RMSE of 0.70 mm d - 1 ) than the bulk transfer method (RMSE of 0.83 mm d - 1 ). However, if EC data are available, further improvement can be gained by using an artificial neural network to adjust the modelled fluxes (RMSE of 0.51 mm d - 1 ). This final step can be very useful for gap-filling missing data from lake observation networks as there has been recent attention on the limited coverage of direct open-water evaporation observations in the literature.

Because of the different growth rate, W subjects were sampled 3 times (at 12, 15 and 18 months of age) while N-subjects were sampled only once (at 15 months of age). The W 12-month-old fish weighed on average 102 g while N-fish did not reach this weight even at 15 months. At this age, the W subjects showed, in comparison with N-subjects, higher body weight (143 vs. 85 g), component weights, linear measurements (20.94 vs. 17.8 cm), fins (1.80 vs. 1.63 g) and filleting remnants (12.80 vs. 11.25%) and lower incidence of skin and head index; no differences resulted in proximate analysis, but muscles of W-fish were richer in saturated fatty acid and in n-3 PUFA content and showed a higher n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio. By comparison with the 15-month-old subjects collected in October 1999, the 12-month-old W-subjects, collected in July 1992, showed lower fin (0.59 vs. 1.8%), viscera (7.6 vs. 10.2%) and head (20.36 vs. 22.92%) percentages but higher gill (4.27 vs. 3.24%), filleting remnant (14.99 vs. 12.80%), skin (3.92 vs. 3.37%) and dressing (92.4 vs. 89.79%) percentages. The 18-month-old W-subjects, collected in January 1993, did not differ significantly from the 15-month-old subjects either in body weight (154 vs. 143 g) or in the other traits studied, excluding the incidence of viscera (12.01 vs. 10.21%) and gills (2.69 vs. 3.34%), respectively, in the older subjects. Intramuscular lipid content decreased from July according to a seasonal trend. Allometric coefficient showed tachyauxesis for viscera, pectoral and pelvic fins, skin and total muscle and bradyauxesis for filleting remnants and head.

This research aims to enhance understanding of hydrological dynamics and environmental changes in the region for sustainable water resource management and conservation. It employs the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model and the standard Groundwater Level Index to determine the hydrological components, groundwater level, and fluctuations of the catchments over time. The model has been rerun with Global Climate Model (GCM) derived scenarios for predicting seasonal hydrological components. To assess changes in the land use and land cover around Kivu Lake, CA-Markov and regression analysis were also applied. Different calibration and validation schemes, as well as hydrological component patterns, were implemented. Across all catchments, streamflow ranged from 40.89 m 3 s - 1 -170.45 m 3 s - 1 , indicating a good fit between observed and simulated data. At Sake 's northernmost point, a catchment 's maximum average annual evapotranspiration was 1480.89 mm, with the same amount of precipitation, and the groundwater percolation rate ranged from 103.8 to 318.3 mmyr - 1 . According to the seasonal hydrological component trends, Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP)119 predicted discharge ranging from 3.5% to 13.6% and SSP545 predicted discharge ranging from 1.8% to 10.83% for all catchments. Furthermore, under SSP119 and SSP545, average ET will range from 3.3% to 13.69% and from 4.33% to 15.63%, respectively. The 88.36% of the catchment from South Kivu in Kalehe district has shifted from forest to agriculture. This has the potential to dramatically alter percolation in the region. The findings of this research will assist decision -makers and resource managers in Kivu Lake catchments in making informed decisions regarding water allocation, land management practices, and conservation efforts.

By isolating the water column from the atmosphere, ice, typically topped by snow, drastically alters albedo, surface roughness, and heat exchanges relative to the open water period, with major climatic, ecological, and hydrological implications. Lake models used to simulate the appearance and disappearance of the ice cover have rarely been validated with detailed in situ observations of snow and ice. In this study, we investigate the ability of the physically-based 1D Canadian Small Lake Model (CSLM) to simulate the freeze-up, ice-cover growth, and breakup of a small boreal lake. The model, driven offline by local weather observations, is run on Lake Pich & eacute;, 0.15 km2 and 4 m deep (47.32 degrees N; 71.15 degrees W) from 25 October 2019 to 20 July 2021, and compared to observations of the temperature profile and ice and snow cover properties. Our results show that the CSLM is able to reproduce the total ice thickness (average error of 15 cm) but not the ice type-specific thickness, underestimating clear ice and overestimating snow ice. CSLM manages to reproduce snow depth (errors less than 10 cm). However, it has an average cold bias of 2 degrees C and an underestimation of average snow density of 34 kg m-3. Observed and model freeze-up and break-up dates are very similar, as the model is able to predict the longevity of the ice cover to within 2 weeks. CSLM successfully reproduces seasonal stratification, the mixed layer depth, and surface water temperatures, while it shows discrepancies in simulating bottom waters especially during the open water period.																				2296-665X				JUN 17	2024	12								1371108	10.3389/fenvs.2024.1371108	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2024.1371108													WOS:001258695600001
J	Bragg, CJ; Commerford, JL				Bragg, Colton J.; Commerford, Julie L.			Examining climate and composition differences in eastern North American temperate forests using pollen ratios and pollen assemblage cluster analysis	VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY												Ecologically and economically important temperate forests cover much of North America, and these forests contain compositionally distinct forest subtypes. The relationships between vegetation composition, climate, and the pollen taxa that represent eastern North American temperate forests have been studied for decades. However, few have examined the pollen taxa that represent subtypes of these forests at the ecoregion level. Pollen ratios of key taxa and self-organized mapping (SOM) analysis both show promise for identifying compositional differences in vegetation, and ultimately, climate. Using contemporary pollen samples from surficial lake sediments in the western Great Lakes region, we evaluated both methods. Quercus:Fagus, Quercus:Betula, Carya:Pinus, and Carya:Betula pollen ratios were tested for their ability to reveal relative levels of mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, and mean growing season precipitation, as well as to distinguish between ecoregions. All four ratios were significantly positively correlated with almost all tested climate metrics and were able to differentiate between ecoregions in many instances. We suggest that the Quercus:Betula ratio shows the most promise for application in palaeoecological studies because the two taxa have opposite spatial distributions and incorporate species that occupy more specific climate spaces relative to the other ratios. Additionally, the SOM analysis revealed three sample groups that cluster geographically and appear to represent distinct forest subtypes. Based on these results, SOM has potential for application in future palaeoecological reconstructions.																			0939-6314	1617-6278				NOV	2024	33	6					741	752		10.1007/s00334-024-01002-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-024-01002-x		JUN 2024											WOS:001246798800001

Sexual conflict over mating frequency can lead to antagonistic coevolution in which males employ tactics to coerce females into mating, while females resist or evade mating attempts by males. Here, we report on a novel burying behavior observed in female northern map turtles (Graptemys geographica) in Opinicon Lake, Ontario, Canada that appears to function as a tactic to avoid male detection during the mating season. Underwater videos indicated that females are heavily solicited during the mating season with over half the females being actively pursued by males. Biologgers indicated that females are less active and remain deeper than males during the mating season. Our data strongly suggest that female northern map turtles avoid intense solicitation and potential harassment by males by burying themselves in lake sediments. This behavior appears to be a low-cost solution for females to reduce the costs of resistance and mating while they are constrained to habitats with high male densities for overwintering. Female northern map turtles are heavily solicited by males during the mating season with over half of the females observed swimming being pursued by one to three males (bottom left). Females appear to reduce detection by males by burying themselves in the sediments (top), reducing their activity, and by remaining at a more constant depth (bottom right).image					; Blouin-Demers, Gabriel/GRS-0626-2022; Bulté, Grégory/AAU-4650-2021; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010; MacMillan, Heath/J-6943-2012	Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; 													0179-1613	1439-0310				SEP	2024	130	9								10.1111/eth.13488	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eth.13488		JUN 2024											WOS:001247866400001

Located in the SE of France, the elliptical Cengle Plateau stretches 7 km from east to west and is 2 km wide, featuring cliffs ranging in thickness from 20 to 35 m. These cliffs showcase grayish, beige, and pinkish limestones dominated by palustrine facies, forming part of the 'Calcaire de Saint Marc ' Formation of the Arc Basin. Sedimentary deposits within this interval were repeatedly subjected to subaerial exposure due to fluctuations in lake levels driven by climate, resulting in the organization of elementary sequences at decimetric to metric scales, which stack up into small-scale sequences at the decametric order. Deposition occurred under mainly subarid climatic conditions, with paleogeographic variations in the basin corresponding to changes in lake base levels over time and space. At least four frequencies of base level variation are present: very high and seasonal frequency, responsible for the formation of palustrine facies; high frequency, which generates the elementary sequences; medium frequency, which leads to the formation of the small-scale sequences; and low frequency which corresponds to the deposition of the entire set of limestones that form the Cengle cliff. The transition between lacustrine, palustrine, and pedogenic environments consistently occurs from west to east over time. In the more distal regions, the proportion of lacustrine facies tends to increase, and the thicknesses of the preserved sedimentary record tend to be greater. Conversely, palustrine and pedogenic facies predominate in the more proximal areas, typically resulting in decreased thickness. (c) 2024 Elsevier B.V.

A novel device is described that can e use to detect radio signals from depths exceeding the detect. on range of aerial antennas. This device can be used in small, confined bodies of water to track seasonal movements of fish into deep water, to identify locations of lost or expelled transmitters, to monitor relatively immobile benthic species, and to determine swimming or suspended depth while retaining several other advantages associated with the use of radio (versus ultrasonic) transmitters. The device is inexpensive, simple to construct, and easy to use with any commercially available telemetry receiver.

J	Grosse, W				Grosse, W			The mechanism of thermal transpiration (equals thermal osmosis)	AQUATIC BOTANY												Floating-leaved aquatic plants have acquired a convective gas-throughflow system to supply oxygen from the atmosphere to their roots and rhizomes growing in anoxic sediments of shallow lakes and are dependent upon an efficient internal aeration. Tissue layers with minute pores inside the newly-emergent leaves, separating the aerenchyma of the leaves from the ambient atmosphere, create a pressurised ventilation by both the physical effects of hygrometric diffusion (humidity-induced diffusion) and thermal transpiration (thermal osmosis). In mature leaves, these pores are dilated to such an extent that free-flow of gas through this partition is possible. Therefore, the air, which moves into the young leaves (influx leaves) along humidity and temperature gradients, causing pressurisation in the aerenchyma, flows through the continuous intercellular space system and the mature leaves (efflux leaves) back to the atmosphere. Taking into account theoretical considerations and the physical background and anatomical requirements of the leaves, it is explained how the pressurised ventilation, based on thermal transpiration, operates in the aquatic plant during the growing season as soon as two floating leaves have been developed.																			0304-3770					JUL	1996	54	2-3					101	110		10.1016/0304-3770(96)01038-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(96)01038-8													WOS:A1996VJ75500003

Data requirements for prediction are modest (average air temperature, day of the year) and the method is robust and practical, requiring only a few (15-20) well-spaced water temperature observations to construct a single-year model that can generate reasonably accurate predictions for an entire ice-free season. The ability of a singe-lake model to predict several years of temperature data is significantly improved by explicitly including information on ice-out date in the model. Our multiyear model for Lake Opeongo described most (18 of 22) years well. Years that were not well described were usually coincident with El Nino Southern Oscillation events. Used with caution, the method can be an effective tool for supplementing direct monitoring of littoral water temperatures and for generating historical water temperature estimates when direct estimates are lacking. These capabilities should be of particular use to fisheries biologists studying or managing populations of fish species with critical life stages that are affected by littoral water temperatures.

DATA-ANALYSIS AND EXTRACTION OF PALEOCLIMATIC INFORMATION	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The deltaO-18 content of streamflow discharge entering Pyramid Lake is a simple mixture of isotopically enriched Lake Tahoe discharge and isotopically depleted snowmelt. The deltaO-18 value of Pyramid Lake water varies continuously, as isotopically depleted water evaporates from the epilimnion and isotopically depleted water enters the lake as streamflow discharge and on-lake precipitation. In a normal water year, the deltaO-18 of Pyramid Lake surface water varies seasonally because the components of the hydrologic balance in the Pyramid Lake system are seasonally shifted. The problem of isotopic and thermal heterogeneity can be minimized by analyzing carbonates that integrate the annual variance in deltaO-18, form in an environment in which temperature is relatively invariant, and are not subject to recrystallization after deposition.																			0024-3590					MAR	1994	39	2					344	355		10.4319/lo.1994.39.2.0344	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1994.39.2.0344													WOS:A1994NM67900010

Middle and Late Holocene paleolimnological changes in central Lake Tanganyika: Integrated evidence from the Kavala Island Ridge (Tanzania)	HOLOCENE												Middle and Late Holocene sediments have not been extensively sampled in Lake Tanganyika, and much remains unknown about the response of the Rift Valley's largest lake to major environmental shifts during the Holocene, including the termination of the African Humid Period (AHP). Here, we present an integrated study (sedimentology, mineralogy, and geochemistry) of a radiocarbon-dated sediment core from the Kavala Island Ridge (KIR) that reveals paleoenvironmental variability in Lake Tanganyika since the Middle Holocene with decadal to centennial resolution. Massive blue-gray sandy silts represent sediments deposited during the terminal AHP (similar to 5880-4640 cal yr BP), with detrital particle size, carbon concentrations, light stable isotopes, and mineralogy suggesting an influx of river-borne soil organic matter and weathered clay minerals to the lake at that time. Enhanced by the AHP's warm and wet conditions, chemical weathering and erosion of Lake Tanganyika's watershed appears to have promoted considerable nutrient recharge to the lake system. Following a relatively gradual termination of the AHP over the period from similar to 4640 cal yr BP to similar to 3680 cal yr BP, laminated and organic carbon-rich sediments began accumulating on the KIR. delta N-15(bulk), C/N, and hydrogen index data suggest high relative primary production from a mix of algae and cyanobacteria, most likely in response to nutrient availability in the water column under a cooler and seasonally dry climate from similar to 3680 to 1100 cal yr BP. Sediments deposited during the Common Era show considerable variability in magnetic susceptibility, total organic carbon content, carbon isotopes, and C/N, consistent with dynamic hydroclimate conditions that affected the depositional patterns, including substantial changes around the Medieval Climate Anomaly and Little Ice Age. Data from this study highlight the importance of sedimentary records to constrain boundary conditions in hydroclimate and nutrient flux that can inform long-term ecosystem response in Lake Tanganyika.

J	Nakayama, T				Nakayama, Tadanobu			Evaluation of flux and fate of plastic in terrestrial-aquatic-estuarine continuum by using an advanced process-based model	ECOHYDROLOGY												Environmental contamination by plastics has been receiving considerable attention from scientists, policy makers and the public during the last few decades. Though some of the models have succeeded in simulating the transport and fate of plastic debris in freshwater systems, a complete model is now being developed to clarify the dynamic characteristics of the plastic budget on a continental scale. Recently, the author linked two process-based eco-hydrology models, NICE (National Integrated Catchment-based Eco-hydrology) and NICE-BGC (BioGeochemical Cycle), to a plastic debris model that accounts for both the transport and fate of plastic debris (advection, dispersion, diffusion, settling, dissolution and biochemical degradation by light and temperature) and applied these models on a regional scale and also for global major rivers. The present study was newly modified to incorporate the plastic dynamics in estuaries by extending the previous studies. The model was employed to conduct a 2-year global simulation aimed at evaluating changes in plastic dynamics in major rivers including 130 tidal estuaries. The model simulated the impact of estuaries on plastic budget and its seasonal variability caused by settling, resuspension and bedload transport during 2014-2015. The model showed that plastics with smaller particle sizes account for more in the water of estuaries than that of rivers, and plastics with larger particle sizes accumulate more on the riverbed. The simulated result also showed that estuaries trap more plastic than lakes and riverbeds (0.218 +/- 0.053 Tg/year) although not as much as reservoirs (0.386 +/- 0.103 Tg/year). More than 40% of plastics were retained by lakes, reservoirs, riverbeds and estuaries and the riverine plastic transport to the ocean was revised from 1.749 +/- 0.371 Tg/year in the author's previous study to 1.000 +/- 0.397 Tg/year in the present study. These results aid the development of solutions and measures for the reduction of plastic input to the ocean and help quantify the magnitude of plastic transport under climate change.

Diffuse pollution accounts for a substancial share of the total phosphorus load. To improve our knowledge of this pollution, we conducted a watershed study in a small, rural, 302-ha watershed (Lake Leman area). To study the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of phosphorus in the watershed and the corresponding variation in phosphorus speciation, 40 stormflow events over a 4-year period were analysed. We began by defining the 'state' of the watershed using a) periodic field surveys of signs of erosion, b) the length of the flowing ditches and streams (active hydrological network) and the waterpathways on the fields, c) the overall water budget, and d) grab samples of stream water from a network of subwatersheds. Four states that reflected contrasting watershed conditions were identified. Analysis of the data on phosphorus flux at the outlet of the watershed, in conjunction with the observations on the state of the watershed, allowed us to develop a conceptual model of phosphorus export from the watershed and several hypotheses about phosphorus transfer.

Assessing the contributions of the local community (i.e., LCBD, community uniqueness) and species to overall beta diversity (i.e., SCBD, species uniqueness) of fish assemblages is valuable for habitat and species conservation planning, particularly from functional and phylogenetic perspectives. We examined the changes in multifaceted LCBD and SCBD of fish across different hydrological periods in the Poyang Lake, China, and analyzed their responsive mechanisms using regression models, based on which the conservation priorities of habitats and species were evaluated. The findings revealed that taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic LCBD and SCBD were lowest during the wet season compared to the normal and dry seasons, emphasizing the regulatory effects of hydrological regimes on fish assemblages. Taxonomic and functional LCBD were significantly impacted by the mean abundance of migratory fish, highlighting the importance of specific species combinations on community uniqueness. Taxonomic and functional SCBD exhibited positive correlations primarily with mean abundance, suggesting the potential uniqueness of certain common species. Additionally, we identified the river-lake junction (Hukou station) and natural reserve (Xingzi and Nanjishan stations) with high overall community uniqueness as critical habitats. We also emphasized the necessity for increased conservation efforts for species having high overall species uniqueness during different hydrological periods, including Coilia brachygnathus, Ctenopharyngodon idella, Coilia nasus, Saurogobio dabryi, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, Megalobrama amblycephala, and Parabramis pekinensis.

A method to estimate net community metabolism from profiles of dissolved O2 and N2	HYDROBIOLOGIA												A method to estimate net community metabolism (NCM) in natural waters using vertical profiles of water temperature, salinity, dissolved O-2, gas tension, and calculated dissolved N-2 is presented. The method utilizes the disparate biological activity of dissolved O-2 and N-2 to estimate metabolism at different depths in the water column. For well-mixed surface waters, N-2 saturation levels are assumed to be the result of a quasi steady state balance of net warming or cooling and air-water gas exchange. Dissolved O-2 levels are assumed to maintain a similar balance, subject to net biological activity, and NCM is then calculated based on the difference between N-2 and O-2 saturation levels and the estimated timescale required to equilibrate the layer with the atmosphere. For deeper stratified layers of water that warmed after layer formation in isolation from the atmosphere, the temperature at formation is calculated using the measured N-2 concentration and an assumed N-2 saturation level of 100% at formation. By assuming that initial N-2 and O-2 saturation levels were equal, the initial O-2 concentration is calculated based on solubility relationships. NCM of the deeper waters is then estimated based on this information and knowledge of the general seasonal heating cycle of the waters. Daily mean water temperature and dissolved gas levels are used in the calculations. The method was assessed using profile measurements collected at Long Pond, Plymouth, Massachusetts, USA, on 23 August 2002. Oxygen was supersaturated relative to N-2 by approximately 4% in the 0-6 m deep epilimnion, and undersaturated relative to N-2 by approximately 7% in the stratified water at 9 m depth. The estimated 4-day average NCM for the epilimnion was 140 +/- 70 mgC m(-2) day(-1). For waters at 9 m depth, the temperature at formation was calculated to be 6.58 degrees C, and the estimated 100-day average NCM was -2.5 +/- 0.6 mgC m(-3) day(-1). An independent estimate of -4.6 +/- 0.9 mgC m(-3) day(-1) was derived from the measured O-2 decline at 9 m depth over the same period of 2003.

The Mo concentration-depth profiles result from a combination of different transport mechanisms that are compared by computer model calculations.					; Sigg, Laura/AAI-3504-2020	Sigg, Laura/0000-0002-2210-2951; 													0024-3590					MAY	1993	38	3					521	531		10.4319/lo.1993.38.3.0521	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1993.38.3.0521													WOS:A1993LK31400004

Climate-influenced phenology of larval fish transport in a large lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS												Elucidating physical transport phenologies in large lakes can aid understanding of larval recruitment dynamics. Here, we integrate a series of climate, hydrodynamic, biogeochemical, and Lagrangian particle dispersion models to: (1) simulate hatch and transport of fish larvae throughout an illustrative large lake, (2) evaluate patterns of historic and potential future climate-induced larval transport, and (3) consider consequences for overlap with suitable temperatures and prey. Simulations demonstrate that relative offshore transport increases seasonally, with shifts toward offshore transport occurring earlier during relatively warm historic and future simulations. Intra- and inter-annual trends in transport were robust to assumed pelagic larval duration and precise location and timing of hatching. Larvae retained nearshore generally encountered more favorable temperatures and zooplankton densities compared to larvae transported offshore. Larval exploitation of nearshore resources under climate change may depend on a concomitant shift to earlier spawning and hatch times in advance of earlier offshore transport.					; Zhou, Xing/MFJ-7216-2025; Xue, Pengfei/P-4016-2014; Xue, Pengfei/P-4016-2014	Rutherford, Edward/0000-0002-7282-6667; Alsip, Peter/0000-0002-9830-914X; Zhou, Xing/0000-0002-9884-533X; Gardner, Spencer/0000-0002-4628-4569; Rowe, Mark/0000-0002-0852-3346; Xue, Pengfei/0000-0002-5702-421X; Collingsworth, Paris/0000-0003-3294-3065; Hook, Tomas/0000-0001-9185-6741; 														2378-2242				AUG	2024	9	4					376	387		10.1002/lol2.10414	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lol2.10414		JUN 2024											WOS:001239298300001

Agricultural "best management practices" (BMPs) offer a means for achieving reductions in P in drainage water. Prior to developing and implementing BMPs, it is necessary to establish baseline EAA P concentrations. Baseline total P (TP) and total dissolved P (TDP) concentrations for various crop and field conditions in the EAA were determined. Thirty-six 0.7-ha plots were installed at four locations. Average TP and TDP concentrations were derived from 6 to 30 drainage events for each of five conditions between November 1988 and December 1989: sugarcane (Saccharum spp.), radish (Raphanus sativus L.), and cabbage (Brassica oleracea L.) production fields, flooded fallow fields, and drained fallow fields. Baseline TP and TDP concentrations for main farm canals and rainfall were also determined. Average TP concentrations ranged from 0.25 mg L-1 for radishes to 1.03 mg L-1 during the drain-down of flooded fallow plots. Total dissolved P concentrations ranged from 48 to 80% of TP. Main farm canal TP concentrations averaged 0.16 mg L-1. Total P concentrations in rainfall averaged 0.07 mg L-1. Total P in drainage water during 1989 for sugarcane, cabbage, and drained fallow fields were 0.72, 1.38, and 0.59 kg ha-1, respectively. During the radish season, drainage water TP loading was 0.8 kg ha-1. Flooded fallow fields after radishes yielded a TP loading rate of 3.82 kg ha-1. Total P loading to the fields from rainfall averaged 0.70 kg ha-1. Total dissolved P loading rates ranged from 25 to 60% of TP. Potential areas for BMP development and implementation for P concentration and loading reduction in the EAA include drainage rate, volume, and timing management, fertilizer use reduction, and enhanced crop rotation strategies.																			0047-2425					JUL-SEP	1991	20	3					608	619		10.2134/jeq1991.00472425002000030018x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1991.00472425002000030018x													WOS:A1991FZ67800018

Microseisms of Lake Baikal Based on Regional Seismic Network Data	IZVESTIYA-PHYSICS OF THE SOLID EARTH												Peculiarities of microseismic ambient noise are studied based on the data from the stations of regional seismic network located in the central part of the Baikal rift. The probabilistic approach is used to thoroughly investigate the pattern of diurnal variations in microseisms and to analyze the amplitude level and frequency content of the spatial anomalies and the temporal changes (seasonal and annual). Based on the 2020-2021 data, a regional probabilistic model of the microseismic noise is built in a wide range of periods. The study of microseisms in the frequency band of about 1 Hz revealed a seasonal anomaly against the level of the global minimum in the microseismic noise power spectrum. The anomaly is observed from May to December at seismic stations surrounding Lake Baikal except for its northern part. The back azimuth direction in the frequency range of about 1 Hz indicates the arrivals from the location of the lake, suggesting that these signals can be identified as lake-generated microseisms. The high values of the coherence function testify to a linear relation between the wind velocity and the occurrence of lake microseisms. The detailed analysis of the spectral and polarization parameters of the seismic ambient noise revealed two types of lake-generated microseisms with frequencies of 0.4-0.7 and 0.7-1.5 Hz. The first frequency interval is likely to correspond to the single-frequency lake-generated microseisms, while the second interval covers the frequency ranges of the dual-frequency microseisms.

A CASE REPORT ON PRODUCT ROTATION TO MANAGE SEVERE LYSINIBACILLUS SPHAERICUS RESISTANCE IN CULEX PIPIENS FROM SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION												The Salt Lake City Mosquito Abatement District (SLCMAD) detected a 20,000 -fold resistance to Lysinibacillus sphaericus (Lsph) in Culex pipiens occurring in catch basins of Salt Lake City during 2016. In response, SLCMAD suspended use of Lsph and rotated use of spinosyn and s-methoprene products for the next three years. At the end of the third year, Lsph was evaluated again and efficacy similar to susceptible colony strains. During the second year of Lsph use, technicians observed lack of control of larvae at some urban sites. Bioassays performed during 2021 showed recurrence of some resistance to Lsph to varying degrees across SLCMAD urban areas. The rapidity with which resistant phenotypes reemerged clarifies that SLCMAD cannot in the near future rely on repeated use of Lsph, even after suspending use for three years and using within-season product rotations. Prior reports in other research groups have found long-term selection to Lsph , as is the case at SLCMAD, to not regress in spite of halting use of the products. However, our findings offer some optimism that regression may be relatively quick. More operational review is needed, and future work should characterize resistance alleles in field populations. Collectively, there is a lack of concrete data supporting the prevailing assumptions from adjacent industries that were adopted into mosquito abatement. We provide this short note as additional guidance for mosquito and vector control districts weighing options to remediate Lsph resistance.																			8756-971X	1943-6270				JUN	2024	40	2					121	124											38660965					WOS:001241236800007

Superimposed upon this trend, recent observations have revealed that land-ice flow in the Antarctic Peninsula exhibits seasonal velocity variability with distinct summertime speed-ups. The mechanism, or mechanisms, responsible for driving this seasonality are unconstrained at present, yet detailed, process-based understanding of such forcing will be important for accurately estimating Antarctica's future contributions to sea level. Here, we perform time-series analysis on an array of remotely sensed, modeled and reanalysis data sets to examine the influence of potential drivers of ice-flow seasonality in the Antarctic Peninsula. We show that both meltwater presence and ocean temperature act as statistically significant precursors to summertime ice-flow acceleration, although each elicits an ice-velocity response after a distinct lag, with the former prompting a more immediate response. Furthermore, we find that the timing and magnitude of these local drivers are influenced by large-scale climate phenomena, namely the Amundsen Sea Low and the El Ni & ntilde;o Southern Oscillation, with the latter initiating an anomalous wintertime ice-flow acceleration event in 2016. This hitherto unidentified link between seasonal ice flow and large-scale climatic forcing may have important implications for ice discharge at and beyond the Antarctic Peninsula in the future, depending upon how the magnitude, frequency and duration of such climate phenomena evolve in a warming world. Over the past three decades, the speed of Antarctica's seaward-flowing glaciers has accelerated, resulting in increased ice mass-loss to the ocean and corresponding global sea-level rise. Recent work has found that glaciers in the Antarctic Peninsula also experience changes in their flow speed throughout the year, with faster flow (of up to 15% relative to annual-averaged rates) occurring during the summertime. The physical processes responsible for controlling this seasonal behavior, however, are unknown. Here, we examine a range of satellite, atmosphere, and ocean records to determine the main environmental drivers of this seasonal response. Our results show that both surface and oceanic processes are important in driving this behavior, but that the influence of surface processes is more immediate than the relatively time-delayed, or "lagged," effects of the ocean. We also find that both surface and oceanic processes are themselves subject to the influence of larger-scale climate phenomena, including the El Ni & ntilde;o Southern Oscillation. Overall, our results provide new insights into the environmental controls on the recently observed seasonal pattern of ice flow in Antarctica. Surface meltwater extent and sea-ice-modulated oceanic forcing act as statistically significant precursors to summertime ice-flow acceleration in the Antarctic Peninsula Surface meltwater presence and enhanced ocean temperatures presage summertime acceleration with different temporal lead times A relationship exists between El Ni & ntilde;o Southern Oscillation and Antarctic ice-flow seasonality, with the unprecedented magnitude El Ni & ntilde;o event of 2016 driving an anomalous wintertime speed-up through enhanced local surface and oceanic forcing					; Christie, Frazer/AAI-2435-2021	Willis, Ian/0000-0002-0750-7088; Boxall, Karla/0000-0002-6574-7717													2169-9003	2169-9011				JUN	2024	129	6							e2023JF007378	10.1029/2023JF007378	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023JF007378													WOS:001244576800001

Occurring in bedrock depressions between the forest edge and the lake, the aquatic communities in these pools are susceptible to impacts from both international shipping lane traffic and changing climate patterns. Individual pools are small, but the number of pools across the coastal landscape provide an expansive network of variable habitats, with >70,000 pools found in the 48 km of shoreline in the study area. In this study, we aimed to understand the relationships between aquatic invertebrates and abiotic conditions in coastal pools. The Dipteran family Chironomidae were studied because of their ubiquity and diversity in freshwater systems. We used nonmetric multidimensional scaling to describe how Chironomidae diversity and abundance were related to seasonality, habitat, and environmental factors (water chemistry and trace metals). We observed 2 distinct chironomid assemblages associated with habitat type based on chemical characteristics and physical location on the shoreline, including numerous rheophilic species near the lake, where consistent wave wash mimics lotic conditions, and species preferring lentic-mesotrophic conditions near the forest edge. Conductivity and pH were higher in pools near the lake, whereas temperature and dissolved O-2 varied seasonally. Nutrients and metals differed between study sites and pools at each site. At 2 sites, naturally occurring Cu and Al were found at concentrations that exceeded estimated chronic toxicity for sensitive aquatic invertebrates. Pool separation of known tolerant or sensitive species indicated a potential response to elevated metal concentrations. Metals may be an important driver for sensitive species occupancy and survival in certain pools, raising more general concerns regarding community responses to natural conditions in pristine environments.

J	He, MH; Liu, Y				He, Minghui; Liu, Yi			Analysis of Lake Area Dynamics and Driving Forces in the Jianghan Plain Based on GEE and SEM for the Period 1990 to 2020	REMOTE SENSING												The lakes of Jianghan Plain, as an important component of the water bodies in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River plain, have made significant contributions to maintaining the ecological health and promoting the sustainable development of the Jianghan Plain. However, there is a relatively limited understanding regarding the trends of lake area change for different types of lakes and their dominant factors over the past three decades in the Jianghan Plain. Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, combined with the water body index method, the changes in area of three different types of lakes (area > 1 km(2)) in the Jianghan Lake Group from 1990 to 2020 were extracted and analyzed. Additionally, the Partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM) was utilized to analyze the driving factors affecting the changes in water body area of these lakes. The results show that from 1990 to 2020, the area of the lakes of the wet season and level season exhibited a decreasing trend, decreasing by 893.1 km(2) and 77.9 km(2), respectively. However, the area of dry season lakes increased by 59.27 km(2). The areas of all three types of lakes reached their minimum values in 2006. According to the PLS-SEM results, the continuous changes in the lakes' area are mainly controlled by environmental factors overall. Furthermore, human factors mainly influence the mutation of the lakes' area. This study achieved precise extraction of water body areas and accurate analysis of driving factors, providing a basis for a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic changes in the lakes of Jianghan Plain, which is beneficial for the rational utilization and protection of water resources.					贺, 明辉/O-8630-2019	liu, yi/0000-0002-6686-4974														2072-4292				JUN	2024	16	11							1892	10.3390/rs16111892	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16111892													WOS:001246937600001

Andrea			Assessing Ice Break-Up Trends in Slave River Delta through Satellite Observations and Random Forest Modeling	REMOTE SENSING												The seasonal temperature trends and ice phenology in the Great Slave Lake (GSL) are significantly influenced by inflow from the Slave River. The river undergoes a sequence of mechanical break-ups all the way to the GSL, initiating the GSL break-up process. Additionally, upstream water management practices impact the discharge of the Slave River and, consequently, the ice break-up of the GSL. Therefore, monitoring the break-up process at the Slave River Delta (SRD), where the river meets the lake, is crucial for understanding the cascading effects of upstream activities on GSL ice break-up. This research aimed to use Random Forest (RF) models to monitor the ice break-up processes at the SRD using a combination of satellite images with relatively high spatial resolution, including Landsat-5, Landsat-8, Sentinel-2a, and Sentinel-2b. The RF models were trained using selected training pixels to classify ice, open water, and cloud. The onset of break-up was determined by data-driven thresholds on the ice fraction in images with less than 20% cloud coverage. Analysis of break-up timing from 1984 to 2023 revealed a significant earlier trend using the Mann-Kendall test with a p-value of 0.05. Furthermore, break-up data in recent years show a high degree of variability in the break-up rate using images in recent years with better temporal resolution.																				2072-4292				JUN	2024	16	12							2244	10.3390/rs16122244	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16122244													WOS:001257923300001

We examined monthly variations in four T/O compounds from September 2011 to August 2012 in Chaohu Lake's eastern drinking water source (DECL). More importantly, we compared the reported T/O occurrence and the related factors in freshwater bodies worldwide. The assessment of T/O issues indicated a severe and widespread problem, with many cases surpassing odor threshold values. Remarkably, China reported the highest frequency and severity of odor-related problems. A temporal analysis revealed variations in odor occurrences within the same water body across different years, emphasizing the need to consider high values in all seasons for water safety. Globally, T/O issues were widespread, demanding attention to variations within the same water body and across different layers. Algae were crucial contributors to odor compounds, necessitating targeted interventions due to diverse odorant sources and properties. A correlation analysis alone lacked definitive answers, emphasizing the essential role of further validation, such as algae isolation. Nutrients are likely to have influenced the T/O, as GSM and MIB correlated positively with nitrate and ammonia nitrogen in DECL, resulting in proposed control recommendations. This study offers recommendations for freshwater ecosystem management and serves as a foundation for future research and management strategies to address T/O challenges.

Parameters of Water Column Stability in a Small Polymictic Lake in Years of Different Weather Conditions	WATER RESOURCES												The regime of lake mixing has a considerable effect on many aspects of the functioning of aquatic ecosystems, which increases the importance of identifying changes in water mass stability under the effect of climatic factors. This study is focused on the stability of the water mass of a small Vendyurskoe Lake (southern Karelia) in the open-water season in years with various weather conditions. Water temperature measurements in 2008-2013 and 2015-2022 at an autonomous station (thermistor chain) in the central vertical of the lake were used to assess the duration of stratification and the stability of water mass according to various criteria, including the temperature difference over water column of 1 and 2 degrees C, and by threshold values of Schmidt stability, Wedderburn number, and Lake Number. To study the role of radiation mixing in weakening the stability of the lake water mass, the seasonal and interannual variability of the temperature difference between the upper layer of the lake and the air was analyzed using ERA-5 reanalysis data. For detail analysis of this parameter, an appropriate density function was constructed for each year, and its major characteristics were calculated. It was shown that, despite the continuing regional warming and an increase in the temperature of air and the top water layer in Vendyurskoe Lake, no increase in stability was recorded in 2008-2022. Limiting factors can be an increase in convective mixing due to radiative cooling, as well as increased wind load on the water body.

Revealing the distribution of specific phosphorus fractions in bed sediment at river confluences is important for ensuring water security in river networks, because each phosphorus fraction has individual physicochemical properties and ecological effects. The characteristic distributions of phosphorus fractions at river confluences are mainly influenced by hydrodynamics, bed morphology, and sediment transport. In this study, a distributed of sampling on bed sediment of a confluence of Huaihe River Basin was carried out in different seasons and under different hydrodynamic conditions, and the spatial and temporal distribution of phosphorus fractionation were assessed. Bed sediment samples were analyzed for Ca-P, Soluble and loosely bound phosphorus (S/L-P), Reductant Soluble Phosphorus (RS-P), ferrum-bound P (Fe-P), aluminium-bound P (Al-P), organic phosphorus (O-P). The results showed that the content of total phosphorus (TP) in non-flood period and flood period was 897.3 and 484.3mg/kg, respectively. Phosphorus enrichment occurred in the non-flood period but was inhibited during the flood period by coarsened bed surface, intensive hydrodynamics, high water temperature, and low DO. The average percentages of Ca-P, O-P, S/L-P, Fe-P, RS-P, Al-P were 43.6%, 36.6%, 12.0%, 2.9%, 2.8% and 2.1%, respectively, in non-flood period. The spatial distribution of Ca-P was influenced by sediment transport, with increased mixing distance in the flood period. S/L-P, RS-P, and Fe-P mainly enriched in the lateral bar, due to the low horizontal flow velocity and small bed sediment grain size. O-P mainly enriched in the scour hole, probably due to the formation of flocs after the mixing of organic phosphorus-containing suspended sediments from the two branches upstream, which settled in the scour hole. Due to the higher level of phosphorus bioavailability, the scour hole imposed a greater phosphorus exportation risk than other areas of the confluence.

Such long sequences are rare, especially outside of the Mediterranean realm. Additionally, they often lack robust chronologies, which are a precondition for comparisons across records and proxies. In this study we present a refined chronology of the Velay pollen sequence (0 - 423 ka) from south-central France by tuning it to the recently published Lake Ohrid pollen sequence from the southern Balkans, which itself has a vegetation -independent, numerical chronology. Furthermore, we use ordination techniques in combination with independent palaeo-temperature proxies and seasonality as explanatory variables for both sites. This allows us to infer climatic responses of interglacial vegetation over a broad ecological gradient, i.e., from a cool -temperate to a submediterranean site. Our analysis shows that temperature is a significant determinant for interglacial vegetation composition at both sites but explains slightly more variance at cool -temperate Velay compared to submediterranean Lake Ohrid, where precessional -driven moisture availability might have had a greater influence. Temperate oceanic taxa such as Abies and Taxus were most affected by comparably cool or warm interglacials at Velay, whereas at Lake Ohrid, the same accounts for Mediterranean taxa such as Quercus ilex , Q. cerris , or Ostrya / Carpinus orientalis . Responses of single taxa and vegetation groups to seasonality changes over the last five interglacials suggest that species -specific niche preferences have remained stable since 423 ka. Additionally, we suggest that unless a future climate exceeds the MIS 5e anomaly of c. +1.3 degrees C (if compared to the Holocene), evergreen Mediterranean taxa such as Quercus ilex will not expand into temperate biomes north of the Alps.

Despite various approaches to access and directly sample subglacial water and sediments, clean access and exploration of subglacial lakes remain challenging. To address this concern, Jilin University has developed the RECoverable Autonomous Sonde (RECAS) prototype. This technology enables sampling and in-situ detection of subglacial lake water while being isolated from the surface, thus minimizing the risk of pollution. Laboratory tests, including downward and upward drilling, long-running, remote-control, and cold-environment assessments, were conducted to validate the sonde's principle and functionality. During the 38th Chinese National Antarctic Research Expedition, CHINARE (2021-2022 season), the RECAS prototype underwent testing on the flank region of D & aring;lk glacier, 10 km from Zhongshan Station in Antarctica. Three boreholes with depths of 200.3, 183.2, and 133.5 m were successfully drilled, with the refrozen meltwater sealing the boreholes during the process. Approximately 600 mL of melted water samples were collected from each hole. Throughout the drilling tests, all systems of the RECAS prototype performed within the expected ranges.

An experimental test of in-season homing mechanisms used by nest-guarding male Largemouth Bass following displacement	BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES												Through manipulations of sensory functions, researchers have evaluated the various mechanisms by which migratory fish, particularly in lotic systems, locate natal spawning grounds. Comparatively less work has occurred on the ways by which fish in lentic systems locate spawning sites, and more specifically, the ways by which displaced fish in these systems locate their broods post spawning. The primary goal of this research was to determine the sensory mechanisms used by nesting, male Largemouth Bass to navigate back to their brood following displacement. This was accomplished by comparing the ability of visually impaired, olfactory impaired and geomagnetically impaired individuals to return to their nests after a 200 m displacement, relative to control males. All treatments were designed to be temporary and harmless. We analyzed the data using a generalized linear mixed model, and found that the probability of an olfactory impaired individual returning to his nest within a given time interval was significantly lower than the probability of a geomagnetically impaired individual returning. Overall, it appears as though olfaction is the most important sensory mechanism used for homing in Largemouth Bass.

Jute retting during monsoon is a common anthropological activity in the rural Bengal. Quantitative seasonal bio-monitoring of phytoplankton community composition with relative abundance and its diversity indices was carried out in this study from April 2013 to March 2014 to assess water quality and the impact of jute retting on phytoplankton diversity of a tropical fresh water oxbow lake in Nadia district of India. We recorded a total of 34 genera of 5 distinct classes, Chlorophyceae (15), Bacillariophyceae (13), Cyanophyceae (4), Dinophyceae (1) and Euglenophyceae (1). Members of Chlorophyceae dominated throughout the year. Unlike Cyanophyceae, Bacillariophyceae was found to be significantly increased during monsoon when compared to the rest of the year. Average phytoplankton density was highest in post-monsoon (8760/L) followed by monsoon (4680/L) and pre-monsoon (3650/L). Owing to the dominance of class Chlorophyceae and Bacillariophyceae we found this lake to be oligotrophic to mesotrophic. Indices values of genera richness, Shannon-Wiener, evenness and Simpson's diversity reached their lowest 14, 1.61, 0.61 and 0.68 in monsoon and highest 23, 2.42, 0.77 and 0.86 in post monsoon respectively. The lowest diversity values during monsoon clearly suggested that the selected lake has highest anthropogenic pollution due to jute retting which impacted significantly on phytoplankton diversity. Therefore, the lake is not conducive for fish growth especially during monsoon and we opine that there is a need to regulate jute retting process, intensity and its density in the lake during the monsoon to ensure enhanced biodiversity for sustainable management and conservation of aquatic environment of this Oxbow lake.

J	Karvinen, A; Saarnio, S; Kankaala, P				Karvinen, Anu; Saarnio, Sanna; Kankaala, Paula			Sediment iron content does not play a significant suppressive role on methane emissions from boreal littoral sedge (Carex) vegetation	AQUATIC BOTANY												We studied the effects of Fe(III) additions, sediment iron content and other environmental variables on methane (CH4) emissions from stands of two sedges, Carex acuta and Carex rostrata, originating from the littoral area of two boreal lakes having different total iron 33.1(+/- 1.7) and 8.6(+/- 1.2)g kg(-1) (DW) and organic matter content 16.8(+/- 3.1) and 28.2(+/- 2.5)% (of DW) in the sediment, respectively. An outdoor mesocosm experiment was carried out during two ice-free periods. The sediment of mesocosms was treated with amorphous Fe(III) oxyhydroxide (1-2% of the original total iron content). The CH4 emission was measured with the closed-chamber method. The Fe(III) additions did not significantly affect CH4 emissions from either of the Carex stands, although a minor effect on sediment CH4 concentrations could be seen. In both Carex stands the temporal variation of CH4 emission rates was primarily related to sediment CH4 concentration, which was negatively influenced by air pressure and positively by temperature of the preceding week. Despite the greater rhizome iron content, the CH4 emissions from C. acuta stands were greater (1.02-102 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) and 6.68-37.1 CH4 m(-2) d(-1) during the first and second growing season, respectively) than that from C. rostrata stands (0.13-16.9 CH4 m(-2) d(-1) and 1.30-22.8) CH4 m(-2) d(-1), respectively. The iron content of the sediments and rhizomes played a minor role on CH4 emissions from littoral Carex stands. Annual and between-vegetation stand variation in CH4 emissions seemed to be more related to site and taxon-specific differences in plant biomass growth affecting both CH4 production and oxidation in the sediment.

The catchment was separated into four morphological units and core sampling was carried out to analyze pedological horizons. Five stations were surveyed along the stream. The water quality was investigated seasonally through both physical and chemical variables (oxygen, pH, temperature, phosphorus, nitrate) and with the French normalised biological index. The analysis of macroinvertebrates was made with regard to the spatial heterogeneity of the streambed and the community structure, then categorized by habitat preferences and functional feeding groups. The land at the top of the catchment area, consisting of hydromorphic soils, was used for cattle breeding. This generated the increase in suspended sediment and nutrients concentration in the water. However, the decrease in nutrients from up to downstream, and the evolution of the benthic communities, indicated an improvement in water quality. The high degree of self-purification in the catchment area may result from the combined action of ungrazed hydromorphic soils, ponds and natural purification of the stream. Moreover, the geomorphological characteristics of the catchment influence physical and chemical variables, as well as the biological traits of the macroinvertebrates. As a consequence, the indices of taxa diversity, weighted according to substrates types, seemed to be the most accurate descriptors of the environmental changes. Thus, the resilience of the aquatic ecosystem may be influenced by the degree of complexity of the watershed geomorphology.																			0018-8158					MAR	2000	421						129	139																WOS:000086541800012

More than 21 taxa, including two aquatic angiosperms, were found and the taxa with high frequency of occurrence were Enteromorpha spp. and Sargassum thunbergii. Ruppia maritima, one of the endangered aquatic macrophytes in Japan, was also found making dense meadows in Honjou, an area planned to be reclaimed. Four distinct distributional regions were recognized in the lake by principal component analysis (PCA) using the seasonal maximum cover of each species, and a significant relation was found between PCA axis 1 and electric conductivity. A long-term change in floristic composition is also discussed based on the present results and literature. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The periodicity and distribution as well as the ecological role of sulfur bacteria have also been examined. Through our study, the seasonal pattern of nutrients is indicative of a return to a stabilized trophic state after trophic upsurge. However, the concomitant exponential increase in phytoplankton biomass may have caused this nutrient seasonality. Phytoplankton biomass values ranged from 56 to 7322 mg/m(3). Longitudinal differentiation was observed within the reservoir in regard to seasonal development of phytoplankton originating from the differences in the water column stability. At the shallow, less disturbed part of the reservoir, the organization of phytoplankton community was directed towards increased structural complexity of late-successional stages. At the region of the dam, compositional changes of phytoplankton were primarily generated by strong external disturbances that kept the succession in a rather primitive stage. An 'upwelling' of sulfur bacteria from the deep sulfide rich water resulted in their temporary dominance in autotrophic plankton and an additional food supply to higher trophic levels in the oxic part of the reservoir.

These metals tend to bioaccumulate in fish, posing a concern to human health. This study reported the concentration of lead and mercury in water, sediment, and fish muscles of Baraila Lake in the year 2022. The samples were collected from pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons at four sampling locations, i.e., Loma, Dhulwar, Chakaiya, and Kawai Baraila, and were analyzed in triplicates. Lead concentration in water samples of all four sites of Baraila Lake observed during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon season exceeded the permissible limit for drinking water, while the mercury concentration of all sites was under the permissible limit in both seasons as prescribed by WHO. The extent of elemental pollution was evaluated using the Geo-accumulation index (Igeo), contamination factor (CF), contamination degree (Cd), ecological risk factor (Er), and the potential ecological risk index (Ri). Lead concentration in fish muscles of both seasons exceeded the permissible limit, while the concentration of mercury exceeded in Xenentodon cancila (0.55 +/- 0.07 mu g/g) during the pre-monsoon season. Also, estimated daily intake (EDI), target hazard quotient (THQ), and hazard index (HI) were calculated in different fish muscles to assess potential human health risks. A higher THQ value of 1.303 was observed in carnivore fish during the pre-monsoon season.

However, how the combined effects of the different dimensions contribute to the partitioning during the ontogenetic process is unclear. We sampled two sympatric icefish species [Protosalanx hyalocranius (Abbott, 1901) and Neosalanx taihuensis (Chen, 1956)] monthly from July 2015 to June 2016 in Hongze Lake, China. We evaluated the hypothesis that combined effects of separation in gonad development dynamics and ontogenetic diet shifts facilitate resource partitioning in temporal and trophic dimensions during the entire life cycle process of the two icefish species. Increased gonadosomatic index (GSI) of female P. hyalocranius occurred during October 2015 to January 2016, and that of female N. taihuensis occurred during January to March 2016. Thus, energy and nutrition investments in gonad development separated seasonally between the two species. Consequently, temporal separations in gonad development between P. hyalocranius (GSI peaked in January) and N. taihuensis (GSI peaked in March) indicated potential segregations in spawning time and consequent larval abundance peaks, suggesting reduced overlap of prey consumption during the early life stages. The dominant diet of P. hyalocranius shifted from cladocerans to copepods, and then shrimp, and finally to fish during its ontogeny, whereas the dominant diet of N. taihuensis changed gradually from cladocerans to copepods during its ontogeny. The diet overlap in cladocerans during May was high between the two species. Our findings support the hypothesis of an associative strategy, combining temporal (separations in gonad development and subsequently spawning time) and trophic (ontogenetic diet shifts) dimensions, for the resource partitioning between P. hyalocranius and N. taihuensis, which may be an important mechanism for long-term coexistence among sympatric short-lived fishes.						cheng, fei/0000-0002-5894-1618													0046-5070	1365-2427				JUL	2024	69	7					959	970		10.1111/fwb.14258	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.14258		MAY 2024											WOS:001225991600001

Unfortunately, these patterns may be confounded by temporal variation that will affect follow-up studies of the recovery of these communities. Here, we assess spatial and temporal variation in time-limited, kick-and-sweep collections of littoral-zone benthos. Spatial variation comprised five sites representing the predominant nearshore substrates in each of three lakes. Temporal variation spanned a different scale in each lake with five sites sampled: (i) twice on the same day, (ii) once a week for 3 weeks, and (iii) four times through the ice-free season. Variation was quantified using a model II analysis of variance. Spatial differences predominated in same-day samples (60.4% of the variation on average) and those collected over a 3-week period (46.1%). In contrast, samples collected over the ice-free season revealed that spatial and temporal factors accounted for 9.4 and 25.6% of the variation. We conclude that our collections of littoral macrobenthos are highly repeatable if sampling is restricted to short periods (e.g., 3 weeks). Surveys spanning longer periods may incorporate considerable temporal variation from seasonal changes in abundance.

In situ aerobic methane oxidation rates in a stratified lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Microbial aerobic methane oxidation is an important sink for aquatic methane worldwide. Despite its importance to global methane fluxes, few aerobic methane oxidation rates have been obtained in freshwater or marine environments without imposing changes to the microbial community through use of ex situ methods. A novel in situ incubation method for continuous time-series measurements was used in Jordan Lake, North Carolina, during 2020-2021, to determine reaction kinetics for aerobic methane oxidation rates across a wide range of naturally varying methane (55-1833 nM) and dissolved oxygen (DO; 28-366 mu M) concentrations and temperatures (17-30 degrees C). Methane oxidation began immediately at the start of each of 21 incubations and methane oxidation rates were 1(st) order with respect to methane. The data density allowed for accurate calculation of 1(st)-order rate constants, k, that ranged from 0.018 to 0.462 h(-1) (R-2 > 0.967). Addition of ammonium (20-45 mu M) to natural concentrations ranging from 0.057 to 2.4 mu M did not change aerobic methane oxidation rate kinetics, suggesting that the natural population of aerobic methane oxidizers in this eutrophic lake was not nitrogen limited. Values of k inversely correlated most strongly with initial DO concentrations (R-2 = 0.82) rather than temperature. Values for k increased with Julian day throughout our sampling period, suggesting seasonal influences on methane oxidation via responses to geochemical changes or shifts in microbial community abundance and composition. These experiments demonstrate a high variability in the enzymatic capacity for 1(st)-order methane oxidation rates in this eutrophic lake that is tightly and inversely coupled to oxygen concentrations. Measurements of in situ aerobic methane oxidation rate constants allow for the direct quantification and modeling of the microbial community's capacity for methane oxidation over a wide range of natural methane concentrations.					; lloyd, Karen/A-4165-2011	Baily, Jennifer/0009-0006-8866-3977; Morningstar, Joshua/0000-0003-0419-1580; Lloyd, Karen/0000-0003-0914-6375													0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2025	70			1	SI		S55	S68		10.1002/lno.12583	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.12583		MAY 2024											WOS:001225592900001

DBC, present in all aquatic environments, is a heterogeneous mixture of various pyrogenic aromatics. For a long time, oceans were solely considered to be the largest pool of DBC. However, recent research indicates that lakes might also contain significant concentrations of DBC. Anthropogenic BC emissions and seasonal changes driven by climate change could increase DBC flux to glacial and fluvial lacustrine systems with unique effects. In this article, current knowledge concerning the formation, sources, transportation, fate, and environmental implications of DBC in lacustrine networks is presented. Furthermore, ambiguities pertaining to terminology and methodologies used in the separation and quantification of DBC are also reviewed, and research gaps that should be addressed in future studies are highlighted. Constraining DBC dynamics and residence times in lacustrine systems could provide valuable insights into anthropogenic perturbations of the global carbon cycle.

Herein, we studied: (i) the seasonal dynamics and abundance of ticks in areas where capybaras live, (ii) the effect of environmental variables on tick abundance, and (iii) the presence of Rickettsia-infected ticks. Between September 2021 and September 2022, we sampled ticks using cloth-dragging at 194 sites on the shore of Lake Parano & aacute; in Bras & iacute;lia, Brazil. We measured environmental data (season, vegetation type, canopy density, temperature, humidity, and presence or vestige of capybara) at each site. Nymphs and adults were morphologically identified to the species level, and a selected tick sample including larvae was subjected to genotypic identification. We investigated Rickettsia-infected ticks by PCR (gltA, htrA, ompB, and ompA genes) and associations between tick abundance and environmental variables using Generalized Linear Models. A total of 30,334 ticks (96% larvae) were captured. Ticks were identified as Amblyomma, with A. sculptum comprising 97% of the adult/nymphs. Genotype identification of a larval sample confirmed that 95% belonged to A. dubitatum. Seasonal variables showed significant effects on tick abundance. Most larvae and nymphs were captured during the early dry season, while the adults were more abundant during the wet season. Vegetation variables and the presence of capybaras showed no association with tick abundance.

J	Barati, A; Aliakbari, A; Ghasempouri, SM				Barati, Ahmad; Aliakbari, Asieh; Ghasempouri, Seyed Mahmoud			Variations in breeding success and daily nest survival of Whiskered Tern (Chlidonias hybrida) at two Iranian colonies	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Variations in breeding success of the Whiskered Terns (Chlidonias hybrida) were studied in two wetlands; Anzali (2005 and 2008) and Zarivar (2007-2008) in north and west Iran. Nesting success was modeled and compared using information-theoretic approach implemented in program Mark in order to assess effects of colony locations, years and nest initiation dates on the probability of daily nest survival. Clutch size did not vary between colonies and years. Breeding success varied between colonies (Zarivar > Anzali), and years only in Anzali (2005 > 2008). Overall daily nest survival was 0.977. (95% LCI 0.973, UCI 0.981), equivalent to a Mayfield nest survival of 0.317. (95% LCI 0.255, UCI 0.387). Egg-laying periods and colony site were important covariates affecting the daily survival rates (I pound omega (i) = 0.86 and I pound omega (i) = 0.83, respectively), while, the support for the effect of year was less (I pound omega (i) = 0.41). We concluded that Lake Zarivar provides a more favorable nesting location for Whiskered Terns probably because of little changes in rainfall and water depth during the breeding seasons which influence breeding performance.					; Ghasempouri, Seyed Mahmoud/AAW-7314-2021	Ghasempouri, Seyed Mahmoud/0000-0003-1129-4406; 													1067-4136	1608-3334				JUL	2011	42	4					315	320		10.1134/S1067413611040059	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1067413611040059													WOS:000292461900008
J	Bailey, PCE; Watkins, SC; Morris, KL; Boon, PI				Bailey, PCE; Watkins, SC; Morris, KL; Boon, PI			Do Melaleuca ericifolia Sm. leaves suppress organic matter decay in freshwater wetlands?	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Essential oils of paperbarks, Melaleuca spp., have been shown in laboratory studies to inhibit bacterial activity and slow the rate of cellulose decay. Field (Gippsland Lakes, south-eastern Victoria, Australia) and glasshouse experiments were conducted to test the hypothesis that leaves of Melaleuca ericifolia SM. (the swamp paperbark) suppressed the decay of leaf litter under conditions existing or mimicking those in natural wetlands. Under field conditions, neither brown nor green M. ericifolia leaves, at loadings that would normally occur in a typical paperbark wetland and over a range of leaf-mass ratios, significantly affected the decay rate of two common freshwater macrophytes, Triglochin procerum (water ribbon) and Phragmites australis (common reed). In contrast, glasshouse experiments showed that Melaleuca ericifolia leaves (both intact and ground, and both brown and green) suppressed decay of T procerum when placed in moist conditions on the sediment surface. However, no inhibitory effect was observed when leaves were flooded. Purified, commercially available Melaleuca essential oil (extracted from Melaleuca alternifolia leaves) decreased the rate at which T procerum leaves decayed under glasshouse conditions by as much as 43 %. As with entire leaves, the inhibitory effect of purified Melateuca essential oil was greatest when the leaves were placed in moist, but not submerged, conditions. Experiments designed to test the possibility that the inhibition was due to a simple, physical (coating) effect rather than metabolic inhibition of microbes showed clearly that the effect was not due simply to the hydrophobic nature of essential oils. This study indicates that M. ericifolia leaf litter in freshwater wetlands probably exerts only a small effect on the rate at which leaves from other wetland plant species decay. Any inhibitory effect is likely to be greater after water levels drop (e.g., seasonally in a Mediterranean climate) and remaining leaf material is left moist on the surface of water logged sediments than when material is totally submerged, as during the wetland's high water phase.																			0003-9136					JAN	2003	156	2					225	240		10.1127/0003-9136/2003/0156-0225	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2003/0156-0225													WOS:000181163400005
J	MOURELATOS, S; LACROIX, G				MOURELATOS, S; LACROIX, G			INSITU FILTERING RATES OF CLADOCERA - EFFECT OF BODY LENGTH, TEMPERATURE, AND FOOD CONCENTRATION	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The individual filtering rates of the cladocerans in Creteil Lake were measured in the daytime with 14C-labeled Chlorella during a seasonal survey. This mesotrophic, shallow, polymictic lake is characterized by small algae (<25 .mu.m) and cladocerans (<1.3 mm). Multiple regression models were established for each genus and for all the cladocerans. Body length alone explained from 44 to 57% of the total variance in the filtering rates of Daphnia spp., Ceriodaphnia spp., and Diaphanosoma brachyurum. An additional 23-34% of the variance was attributable to temperature. The inclusion of the Chl a concentration finally yielded r2 values ranging between 0.79 and 0.84. On the other hand, body length and temperature explained only 16% of the total variance in filtering rate of Bosmina longirostris. By taking into account the effect of factors other than length of the animal, the fit of the model established for all cladocerans improved considerably (from r2 = 0.47 to r2 = 0.83). Species-specific responses and thermal effects in the lake show the difficulty of applying models based solely on body length to obtain sufficiently accurate estimates of cladoceran filtering rates.

The present seasonal study has aimed to explore an under-researched subject of analyzing the water quality of the wetland through multi-metric biomonitoring approaches in 2022. A total of 24 water and benthic samples were collected from the four sampling locations. All the water parameters were within a suitable range to support diverse range of flora and fauna, except total suspended solids (TSS) and nutrient, indicating toward the impact of agricultural expansion in the wetland's area. Out of the 13 identified families of benthic macroinvertebrates, the semi-tolerant family of Viviparidae and Bithyniidae has dominated the wetland, with a relative abundance of 27.04 and 37.77%, respectively, in the comparative seasons. Moreover, the indices used in the study has categorized the wetland under moderately polluted condition. The Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) analysis has revealed the sensitivity toward organic pollution and habitat preferences has played major role in the species-specific assemblage of benthic community. The Mantel's correlogram further validates that the moderately polluted status of wetland has favored semi-tolerant to tolerant fauna in the wetland.

J	Chang, SP; Wen, CG				Chang, SP; Wen, CG			Changes in water quality in the newly impounded subtropical Feitsui Reservoir, Taiwan	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Water quality and trophic conditions in the Feitsui Reservoir, a subtropical reservoir, were evaluated with data from a ten-year data base to depict the impacts of river impoundment upon the chemical and biological characteristics of a reservoir, and to discuss the effects of flushing rate on in-lake phosphorus concentrations and phytoplankton growth. The results of the investigation showed that during the incipient impounding period, the water quality in the Feitsui Reservoir was significantly affected by internal loadings from submerged vegetation and soil in the flooded area. Studies of the changes in phosphorus compounds indicated that total phosphorus concentration appeared to approach equilibrium after the seventh year of impoundment and that orthophosphate stabilized after the sixth year of impoundment. Concentrations of both phosphorus forms varied seasonally after attaining stability. Nitrogen compounds (NH3-N, NO3-N and NO2-N) approached equilibrium within three years after impoundment. The seasonal variation in carbon was correlated to the number of phytoplankton. The mean value of the N:P mass ratio has remained over 110 since year seven of impoundment (1990), indicating that phosphorus constitutes the potential limiting nutrient in the growth of phytoplankton. The rapid flushing rate (132.11 and 110.43 yr(-1)) in Feitsui Reservoir during the first and second impounding stages was a critical factor influencing the phytoplankton growth response to available nutrients.																			0043-1370					APR	1997	33	2					343	357		10.1111/j.1752-1688.1997.tb03514.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.1997.tb03514.x													WOS:A1997WX81100011

The objective was to identify the preferred hosts of G. f. fuscipes, the emanations of which may be attractive to this species. Hourly catches of flies in biconical traps were related to changes in the weather and the prevalence of hosts in the vicinity of traps. Flies were mainly active between 0800 and 1600 h, with males peaking around 1100 h and females around 1300 h. Activity of flies correlated directly with light intensity and temperature, but indirectly with relative humidity. Humans, livestock and the monitor lizard, Varanus niloticus, were the predominant hosts, although a significant positive correlation with fly catches could only be established with the prevalence of lizards. Blood meal identification by microscopic and serological methods showed that 73-98% of G. f. fuscipes fed on monitor lizards irrespective of host prevalence, season or location. The significance and possible epidemiological importance of the relationship between G. f. fuscipes and monitor lizards are discussed.																			0007-4853	1475-2670				APR	1997	87	2					179	186		10.1017/S0007485300027334	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007485300027334													WOS:A1997WW74900010

The stomach contents consisted predominantly of benthic invertebrates, such as blackfly larvae Simulium vittatum (58%), chironomids (24%) and the freshwater snail Radix peregra (7%). The seasonal and spatial patterns of S. vittatum in the stomach contents were consistent with published studies on the life cycle and production of S. vittatum in the River Laxa. Close to the Lake Myvatn outlet (0-16 km), S. vittatum constituted 63% of the stomach content volume, and exhibited two peaks (i.e., generations) in its seasonal contribution to the stomach contents, whereas further downstream (16-35 km) S. vittatum constituted 45% of the volume and showed only clear evidence of one generation. Seasonal fluctuations in S. vittatum availability appear to affect the stomach fullness and the condition factor of the trout, especially close to the lake outlet where the fluctuations are pronounced.

Studies measuring DOM at short intervals in lakes are rare, and thus its short-term dynamics are largely unknown. We investigated DOM temporal variation in large, shallow, eutrophic Lake V & otilde;rtsj & auml;rv (Estonia) during one growing season (May-Sep 2016) using a field-deployable in situ spectrometer to measure absorbance spectra (wavelength range 200-708 nm) at a 2 h interval coupled with monthly discrete water sampling. Collected spectra were analyzed together with some in-lake variables, lake metabolic rates, and meteorological and hydrological data using boosted regression tree (BRT) and random forest (RF) models. Different spectral parameters were used to assess total and allochthonous DOM quantity and relative share of autochthonous DOM. All parameters (i.e., DOM quantity and quality) varied on a large scale. For example, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations ranged from 12.0 to 17.3 mg L-1. High levels of DOM were mainly of allochthonous origin, and a strong relationship with inflow indicated the same. The relative share of autochthonous DOM increased with rising air temperature as primary production rose in warm water; however, we found no direct relationships with gross primary production. RF and BRT models explained up to 38% and 63% of DOM temporal variability, respectively. Our results showed that monthly water samples did not capture large variation in DOM. Therefore, high-frequency measurements using in situ spectrometry improve temporal representativeness of DOM monitoring in lakes compared to traditional sampling methods.

Longfin smelt and mysid samples collected in Lake Washington from 1988 to 1992 were examined, and historic data on smelt and mysid abundance were reviewed to assess the impacts of smelt predation on Neomysis mercedis. The feeding habits of smelt were also examined for differences between odd and even years, and seasonal and ontogenetic variations in smelt diet were described. 2. A reciprocal relationship in the abundance of 1+ smelt and Neomysis suggested that smelt regulate mysid abundance in the lake. 3. The proportion of smelt diet contributed by mysids was higher for less abundant year classes of smelt. 4.

The two A. gambiae complex species are A. melas and A. gambiae s.s. The former is the most abundant (88%). The brackish lake ecosystem gives to both species possibilities of adaptation, The salt water species of the A. gambiae complex, A. melas, was found to be tolerant to waters with very low to be salinity. On the other hand, A. gambiae s.s. was found to support relatively high salinity rates. Both specimens live together the whole year round but their frequencies vary with the inundation of the lake. During inundation the salt rate decreases and A. melas eventually disappears. Transmission is low, seasonal and short on the lake, It is perceptible between March and August. The inoculation rate (11 infected bites per man/year) is lower than what we have observed in other lagoon areas of Benin, or even in the city of Cotonou (33 infected bites per man/year). The low malaria transmission on the lake is probably due to the presence of an Important population of A. melas with low infection rates and the widespread use of bed nets.																			0365-6527					SEP	1995	75	3					219	227											8849299					WOS:A1995TM73100006

The horizontal distribution of plankton in Loch Ness, a deep, oligotrophic lake with a simple trench morphometry, was studied on three occasions in 1993. Samples were collected from ten stations spaced along the length of the loch and the abundance of algae, bacteria, protozoa, rotifers and crustacean zooplankton was determined. 2. Horizontal variability was found to be greatest for the metazoan zooplankton and for the algae, especially lure cryptomonad flagellates. Bacteria and heterotrophic protozoa showed relatively little horizontal variability. The degree of horizontal variability was not sufficient seriously to affect studies of the seasonality of plankton abundance conducted from a single sampling station. 3. Gradients of plankton distribution along the length of the loch were dependent on the recent wind history. The direction of the gradient could readily reverse with a shift in wind direction. These results indicate that the horizontal distribution of plankton in Loch Ness is more dependent on wind-induced water circulation patterns than on differential growth of plankton in water masses of differing chemistry.

Over all years combined, slimy sculpins Cottus cognatus contributed the most (39-52%) by wet weight to the diet, followed by alewives Alosa pseudoharengus (3-38%), rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax (17-43%), and johnny darters Etheostoma nigrum (2-10%). Over 90% of alewives eaten during April-May and June were age 1, and 98% of those eaten during October were age 0 (few alewives were eaten in July-August). Mean lengths of rainbow smelt and slimy sculpins in stomachs increased with size of lake trout. Juvenile lake trout generally fed opportunistically-seasonal and annual changes in diet usually reflected seasonal and annual changes in abundance of prey fishes near bottom where we captured the lake trout. Furthermore, diet within a given season varied with depth of capture of lake trout, and changes with depth in proportions of prey species in lake trout stomachs mirrored changes in proportions of the prey species in trawl catches at the same depth. Alewives (ages 0 and 1) were the only prey fish eaten in substantial quantities by both juvenile lake trout and other salmonines, and thus are a potential focus of competition between these predators.																			0002-8487					MAY	1991	120	3					290	302		10.1577/1548-8659(1991)120<0290:DOJLTI>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1991)120<0290:DOJLTI>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1991FZ41800003

The discharge of 98% of untreated domestic sewage and massive volumes of industrial wastewater from over 7000 industries escalate surface water crises. This study investigates microbial and fecal contamination with particular emphasis on Cryptosporidium in surface water, known for causing waterborne diseases, such as cryptosporidiosis. Findings reveal high Cryptosporidium oocyst concentrations and fecal contamination in various water bodies in Dhaka City. Among the investigated water bodies, the Buriganga River exhibits the highest Cryptosporidium oocyst concentration (46%), while the Balu River, Turag River, Shitalakkhya River, Dhanmondi Lake, Gulshan Lake, Banani Lake, Ramna Lake, and Crescent Lake also present high levels of oocyst concentrations ranging from 21-40%. This study also calculated infection risks and found that the infection risk of swimming is highest during the wet season and is (3.9 +/- 2.2 (95% CI: 3.0-5.0)) x 10(-2) per swimming event, whereas it is approximately (2.4 +/- 1.9 (95% CI: 1.6-3.3)) x 10(-2) during the dry season. Annual diving risks are approximately (1.2 +/- 0.6 (95% CI: 0.9-1.4)) x 10(-2), indicating considerably high risks. Most of the sampling sites generally show significantly higher risks than other study areas like the Mymensingh and Kushtia Districts. In light of these results, we strongly recommend immediate measures to address water quality issues and mitigate the risks associated with Cryptosporidium contamination in Dhaka's surface water.					; Bilal, Hazrat/AAJ-4826-2020; Li, Xiaowen/CAH-9444-2022; Thapa Chhetri, Madan/LZG-5063-2025; Iqbal, Prof Dr Muhammad Shahid/AIB-1390-2022	Supe Tulcan, Roberto Xavier/0000-0002-1333-7847; Thapa Chhetri, Madan/0009-0002-3567-7591; 														2073-4441				MAY	2024	16	10							1352	10.3390/w16101352	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16101352													WOS:001231427900001

Earth sciences perspective	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												The article characterizes ice from the research perspective of Earth sciences applied in the natural environment of the Earth and in Cosmos. In each case, ice is defined as a mineral and monomineral rock occurring in sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic forms. It creates an icy lithosphere that completely covers icy planets and moons. Tectonic features and processes such as faults and folds, subduction as well as cryovolcanic phenomena, commonly occur in such lithosphere. On the Earth's surface, the icy lithosphere occurs in an analogous form, partially covering the land, lakes and oceans in form of glaciations and frozen water. In the Southern Hemisphere, its most spectacular example is the ice of the Antarctic continent and the accompanying shelf and sea ice, and in the Northern Hemisphere, the sea ice of the Arctic Sea and the Greenland ice sheet. Due to the specific natural conditions on Earth, the icy lithosphere here varies seasonally. Therefore, it is generally considered to be an unstable cover, which can only be seen in medium and low latitudes. Nevertheless, near the South Pole, ice may be older than 1,000,000 years. The special properties of ice from the perspective of Earth sciences include its dryness and ability to float on water. As a mineral and rock, ice cannot be a component of the atmosphere or hydrosphere, which are reserved for fluids, i.e. gases and liquids. The perception of Earth's ice should be consistent with how it is seen in Cosmos, because terrestrial conditions are unique and therefore not a valid reference point in analogical research conducted in space. The geocentric paradigm should be replaced by a cosmocentric paradigm as a matter of principle of which can be formulated as follows: The Earth is not the reference point in analogous studies of the natural environment of the celestial bodies. It is the Cosmos and celestial bodies that constitute the reference area for the Earth, and for the study of its natural environment.

J	Yünlü, MZ; Akkas, Y				Yunlu, Melek Zeybek; Akkas, Yeliz			Water quality assessment of the Yalvaç Stream (Isparta, Türkiye) using physicochemical parameters and macroinvertebrate-based indices	BIOLOGIA												The Yalva & ccedil; Stream is one of the important sources feeding Lake E & gbreve;irdir, the second largest freshwater lake in Turkey. Determining the pollution of the stream used for drinking water and agricultural irrigation is important not only for the continuation of the usability of water, but also for determining the pollution load it carries to Lake E & gbreve;irdir. In addition, the macrozoobenthic invertebrate fauna of the stream was revealed in the study. The study was carried out between April 2022 and January 2023, and water and macrozoobenthic invertebrate samples were taken from six stations seasonally. Belgian Biotic Index, BMWP (original and Spanish versions), and species diversity indices were applied for determining the water quality by using the ASTERICS software program. Physicochemical water quality assessment made according to the T & uuml;rkiye Surface Water Quality Regulation. As a result, a total of 49 taxa were detected: three taxa from Gastropoda, two taxa from Hirudinea, one taxon from Malacostraca, and 43 taxa from Insecta. Stations were clustered by using UPGMA based on organisms. Station 6 was the most different one for the macrozoobenthic invertebrates. The lowest species diversity values were also found at this station. Physicochemical parameters and biotic indices showed that while the first three stations were in water quality class I, there was a decrease in the water quality of the other stations. The reasons for the decrease in water quality are due to domestic and agricultural wastes and livestock activities. Additionally, all of the identified taxa were reported as new records for this stream.

The artificial substrata were incubated serially in situ to simulate the age of the natural plant leaves. Throughout the macrophyte growing season, APA per unit of algal Chl on both new and aging leaves was consistently greater for intact epiphytes on artificial plants. This enhancement increased 2-fold to 20-fold (mean 4.5-fold and 7.4-fold for epiphytes from natural and artificial plants) when epiphytes were removed from the plants and suspended before enzymatic assay, exposing more algal cells to the amended PO43- substrate. Comparisons of APA for epiphytes on natural and artificial plants indicated that in this oligotrophic lake, submersed macrophytes were a source of P for epiphytes throughout the growing season and significantly influenced the P metabolism of the microflora. Epiphyte Chl was significantly greater from artificial than from natural plants in 6 of 11 comparisons, however, perhaps indicating a trade-off between improved P availability and some nonbeneficial factor associated with the macrophyte.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	1990	35	3					736	747		10.4319/lo.1990.35.3.0736	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1990.35.3.0736													WOS:A1990DW93500015

Synthetic aperture radar backscatter is influenced by bubbles at the ice/water interface of an Antarctic lake	COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT												Synthetic aperture radar is an invaluable tool for monitoring lake ice. This study utilizes synthetic aperture radar to analyze the 2019-2023 backscatter time series of perennially ice-covered Lake Untersee in East Antarctica. We observed stark seasonal backscatter variations, averaging -9.6 dB from December to March and -3.7 dB from May to November. These fluctuations correspond to the abundance of sub-centimeter bubbles at the ice/water interface. Notably, the backscatter increase in April-May aligns closely with variations in ice thickness across the lake. Our findings suggest that ice cover thickness influences the timing and duration of ice accretion at the bottom, the accumulation of dissolved gases and bubbles, and the resultant changes in surface roughness at the ice/water interface. These factors collectively impact the backscatter response. This study enhances our understanding of the interactions between subsurface processes and synthetic aperture radar backscatter, shedding light on the seasonal dynamics of perennially ice-covered lakes. The number of small bubbles at the ice-water interface in a perennially ice-covered lake varies in response to changes in ice thickness leading to seasonal variations in the backscatter detected by synthetic aperture radar, suggests 4-year observational time series from Lake Untersee, Antarctica.					; Andersen, Dale/B-4816-2013	Andersen, Dale/0000-0001-8827-1259; Lacelle, Denis/0000-0002-6691-8717														2662-4435				APR 20	2024	5	1							213	10.1038/s43247-024-01370-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s43247-024-01370-2													WOS:001205946600003

Patterns of Ultraviolet Radiation Exposure in Bluegill Nests over the Course of the Spawning Season	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Ultraviolet radiation (UVR; wave length, 280-400 nm) can be an important source of mortality for fish, particularly during early life history stages. Because UVR exposure varies seasonally owing to solar angle, climatic conditions, and changes in the UV transparency of water, UVR-induced mortality among temperate fishes may vary as a function of spawning time. We examined patterns of UVR exposure in nests of bluegill Lepomis macrochirus over the course of a spawning season in a highly transparent lake in northeastern Pennsylvania. At the beginning, middle, and end of the spawning season, we measured nest depth and estimated the cumulative UVR exposure of all bluegill nests along three 250-m transects. Cumulative exposure was then used to predict the UVR-induced mortality for bluegill larvae in each nest. The median UVR exposure in bluegill nests was highest at the start of the spawning season, and the predicted UVR-induced larval mortality was at least 10% in 38% of the nests. As the season progressed, the median UVR exposure decreased, and only 4% of the nests were predicted to have larval mortality of at least 10% by the middle and end of the spawning season. This decrease in exposure was partly due to a seasonal decline in UVR transparency. In addition, mean nest depth increased over the course of the spawning season, as bluegills increasingly nested at depths of 4 m or more. Because UVR attenuates with depth, deeper nests received less UVR exposure than did nests closer to the surface. For many species, reproductive success is strongly dependent on spawning time. Our results suggest that in some systems a consequence of early spawning may be an increased risk of UVR-induced mortality.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				SEP	2008	137	5					1446	1454		10.1577/T07-213.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T07-213.1													WOS:000260704300016

Studies on the Ground Water and Surface Water Quality in the surroundings of Kureepuzha Solid Waste dumping site in Kollam District, South India	RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY AND ENVIRONMENT												The physico-chemical and bacteriological quality of ground water and surface water in the surroundings of Kureepuzha waste disposal site in Kollam district, Kerala was studied during the period December 2008 to July 2009. The open well water samples and lake water samples were collected from the selected stations during the post-monsoon (Dec.2008), pre-monsoon (April 2009) and monsoon (July 2009) seasons. The present study showed that most of the physico-chemical parameters of all the ground water samples collected in three seasons are within the permissible limit prescribed by WHO drinking water quality standards, but the acidic pH value, low oxygen content, slightly higher values for nitrate, phosphate, fluoride and higher values of iron Shows the contamination of the open wells by the leachates from the solid wastes dumping area. Microbiological analysis also revealed that all the ground water (open well) samples are bacteriologically contaminated in all the three seasons. Water quality analysis also shows that the ground water quality in the surroundings of solid waste dumping sites is in the very had category In the case of the surface water body studied, the water quality index values obtained showed that station S-5 come under the very bad category and all other stations are under bud category. Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR) of the ground water and surface water samples were calculated for evaluating the suitability of water for irrigation and the SAR values showed that both the ground water and surface water in the study area are good for irrigation purposes.					; D.S./AAR-4078-2021	D.S., Jaya/0000-0002-8554-2620; 													0972-0626					JUN	2011	15	2					952	958																WOS:000294373200172

High Density Nesting of Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) in a Post-fire Great Lakes Jack Pine Forest	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												A stand-replacing fire in 404 ha of jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and mixed pine forest in Michigan's Upper Peninsula in 2007 resulted in Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) nesting at high density in 2008, the second possible nesting season post-fire. Nests were found within a 93-ha study area and a 19-ha stand (a subset of the 93-ha study area) in 199.5 survey hours concentrated in March July. The 19-ha stand had six nests, a density of 0.31 nests/ha or 0.63 individuals/ha, while the 93-ha study area had 20 nests yielding 0.21 nests/ha or 0.42 individuals/ha. These nest densities are higher than previously reported in the literature for comparable stands, indicating a large influx of nesting woodpeckers post-fire. High nesting densities in this study may have resulted from: (1) optimal timing of the fire for wood-boring beetle exploitation of burned trees, (2) the discrete nature of burned habitat in the study due to impacts of salvage logging, or (3) our focus on regions of the burn where high nesting densities occurred, as the entire burned area (404 ha) was not included in nest density calculations.

J	URABE, J				URABE, J			DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS OF ZOOPLANKTON ON SESTON STOICHIOMETRY	ECOSCIENCE												Sestonic particles composed of phytoplankton, bacteria, and detritus are a potential food source for most zoo-plankton. In the present study, the effect of zooplankton on the stoichiometry of seston was examined in a small eutrophic pond from April to August. because the relative elemental contents of seston relates with phytoplankton growth rate and food quality. In the pond, most of the sestonic particles were edible size (< 30 mu m), and sestonic C:P and N:P ratios were high at low zooplankton biomass but low at high zooplankton biomass, suggesting that the zooplankton activity is one of the important factors inducing changes in seston stoichiometry. This possibility was substantiated by grazer gradient experiments that showed a significant increase in the relative P content of the seston with increasing zooplankton biomass. However, slopes of the regression line of the elemental ratios against the zooplankton biomass varied between seasons, and were greater at lower nutrient concentration and higher seston abundance. The relationship implies that the magnitude of the mass-specific effect of zooplankton depends on the relative nutrient concentration available for phytoplankton. In parallel with the grazer gradient experiments, zooplankton grazing was simulated by artificially eliminating some fraction of seston in order to separate the direct (eliminating particles) and indirect (nutrient release) effects on the seston stoichiometry. The response of sestonic elemental ratios to simulated grazing revealed that the zooplankton can affect seston stoichiometry by increasing the per capita availability of a deficient nutrient for phytoplankton through grazing as well as nutrient release. These results suggest that the effect of zooplankton on seston panicles is feedback to their growth rate by changing not only food abundance but also food quality.

So far, the influence of the altitudinal gradient on the microbial community and metabolic characteristics in the early freeze-thaw period of the Qinghai Lake Basin remains unclear. To this end, we collected soil at different elevations in the early freeze-thaw period of the Qinghai Lake Basin and investigated the influence of the elevation gradient on soil microbial community characteristics and soil metabolic processes as well as the corresponding environmental driving mechanism by high-throughput sequencing and LC-MS (Liquid Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer) nontargeted metabolite determination. The results showed that Proteobacteria were the dominant microflora in the Qinghai Lake Basin. The dominant phyla associated with carbon and nitrogen are Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, both of which are significantly affected by elevation. The soil physicochemical factors jointly affected the soil microbial communities and metabolism. Total phosphorus nitrate nitrogen and pH were the main driving factors of the microbial community, and metabolites were sensitive to changes in chemical factors. In short, the microbial community structure and function, soil physicochemical factors and soil metabolic processes were significantly affected by the altitudinal gradient in the early freeze-thaw period, while the microbial community diversity showed no significant response to the altitudinal gradient. Additionally, a high potassium content in the soil may promote the growth and reproduction of bacteria associated with carbon and nitrogen cycling, as well as the production of metabolites.

Glacier ablation is influenced by surface characteristics, in particular the existence of debris cover. The evolution of glaciers may also be influenced by the existence of proglacial lakes, which are worldwide increasing in number and size. We examine the recent changes of the terminus of Pasterze Glacier by discussing the thinning and dynamics of the glacier terminus along with the changes of the glacial-proglacial transition zone between September 2016 and September 2021. By considering land cover in the interpretation, we find that glacier surface characteristics show different rates of elevation changes and surface movement. We mainly use orthophotos and digital elevation models (DEMs) resulting from airborne surveys of 12 different acquisition dates, but also draw on ablation stake measurements, lake water level data, water temperature data, as well as thermal infrared (TIR) imagery. While debris-covered ice lowered typically -5.0 m a-1 +/- 4.6 m a-1 (mean +/- standard deviation), debris-free ice was affected by ablation in the range of -7.0 m a-1 +/- 2.7 m a-1, thus demonstrating that melt rates in similar elevations are related to surface characteristics. The elevation change rates were, in most cases, in a similar range throughout the observed periods of time. The horizontal displacement close to glacier-marginal crevasses amounted to up to -8 m a-1, but was mostly in the range of -1-4 m a-1. Considering both horizontal displacement and elevation changes, we find that clean and dirty ice surfaces show larger thickness losses and are moving faster compared to debris-covered glacier surfaces. Diurnal and seasonal fluctuations of lake water levels in the range of decimeters and lake water temperatures mostly clearly exceeding 0 degrees C are indicative of the potential influence of the proglacial lake on the glacier terminus. Given the decelerating and decaying behavior of the Pasterze Glacier in recent decades, we interpret the change rates of surface lowering and horizontal displacement 2016-2021 to be influenced by other factors such as the recently formed proglacial lake. This is also supported by direct ablation measurements that mostly show lesser ice melt differences compared to DEM-based surface elevation changes, suggesting that other factors such as thermally-induced melting contributed to an increased elevation difference.

J	Khan, TA				Khan, TA			Limnology of four saline lakes in western Victoria, Australia	LIMNOLOGICA												Major physico-chemical parameters of four saline lakes (Lake Colac, Modewarre, Bolac and Tooliorook), in the volcanic plains of western Victoria (Australia), recorded bi-monthly between November 1999-September 2001 are described. Lakes are permanent, large (surface area range 3.5-29.6 km(2)) and shallow (mean depth range 1.5-3.9 m). Physico-chemical parameters revealed that lakes were homogenous with few differences between sites within lakes. Of the four lakes, Lake Modewarre had the highest salinity of 8 ppt with weak seasonal fluctuations in salinity in all the lakes. All the lakes were turbid (turbidity range 30-659 NTU), with low light penetration (suspended solids range 23-465 mg l(-1)) and low Secchi depth (Secchi depth range 7.7-89 cm). pH of the lakes varied between 8.2-9.3 with low seasonal variations, indicating well buffered waters. Based on nutrient status, lakes were classified as eutrophic to highly eutrophic with higher nutrient concentrations. Nitrogen was limiting in one lake (Lake Colac) and phosphorus in the other three lakes. Meteorological events probably influence the physico-chemical parameters of these lakes strongly.																			0075-9511					DEC	2003	33	4					316	326		10.1016/S0075-9511(03)80026-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0075-9511(03)80026-9													WOS:000188696500009

SSM/I and GOES satellite observations reveal that this event was associated with a moisture surge originating in the tropical eastern Pacific. An evaluation of SSM/I and GOES imagery from June through September 1999 indicates that several moisture surges occurred during the North American monsoon season, seldom reaching Las Vegas, but sometimes pushing tropical moisture as far north as Lake Tahoe.

J	PACE, ML				PACE, ML			AN EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS OF ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITY SIZE STRUCTURE ACROSS LAKE TROPHIC GRADIENTS	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The hypothesis was tested that zooplankton community size structure shifts toward an increased relative biomass of microzooplankton with increased lake trophy at 12 sites in Quebec [Canada]. The seasonal mean abundance and biomass of ciliates, rotifers, nauplii, cladocerans, and cyclopoid copepods were significantly (P < 0.1) related to lake trophy, but calanoid copepod abundance and biomass varied independently of lake trophy. Regressions of microzooplankton and macrozooplankton biomass with total phosphorus (TP) were highly significant (P < 0.001), and TP explained a large proportion of the total variation (microzooplankton: r2 = 0.72; macrozooplankton: r2 = 0.86). The regression models for microzooplankton and macrozooplankton were not significantly different, refuting the hypothesis that relative biomass changes with lake trophy. Further analysis with a community structure index (the slope of the log weight-log abundance relationship) and mean lengths of various taxa indicated that zooplankton community size structure was not correlated with either TP or chlorophyll. On average, about 40% of the total zooplankton biomass is accounted for by microzooplankton in the Quebec lakes. The inverse relationship between body size and specific flux rates suggests that microzooplankton account for the major portion of zooplankton community rates.

This study presents an analysis of the spatial and temporal variability of the differences between the LST and in situ observed air and surface temperatures (ISTs) for the southeastern slope of Lake Baikal's surroundings. The IST was measured at 12 ground observation sites located on the southeastern macro-slope of the Primorskiy Ridge (Baikal, Russia) within an elevation range of 460-1656 m above sea level from 2009 to 2021. LST was estimated using 617 Landsat (7 and 8) images from 2009-2021, taking into account brightness temperature, surface emissivity and vegetation cover fraction. The comparison of the LST from satellite data and the IST from ground observation showed relatively high differences, which varied depending on the season and site type. A neural network was suggested and calibrated to improve the LST data. The corrected remote-sensed temperature was found to reproduce the IST very well, with mean differences of about 0.03 degrees C and linear correlation coefficients of 0.98 and 0.95 for the air and surface IST.

Of these samples, 11 were found to be positive for the H13N8 subtype and whole-genome sequencing was performed on them. All samples contained the same virus with the designation A/Unknown/Buryatia/Arangatui-1/2020. To our knowledge, virus A/Unknown/Buryatia/Arangatui-1/2020 is the first representative of the H13N8 subtype collected on the territory of Russia, the sequence of which is available in the GenBank database. An analysis of reassortments based on the genome sequences of other known viruses has shown that A/Unknown/Buryatia/Arangatui-1/2020 arose as a result of reassortment. In addition, a reassortment most likely occurred several decades ago between the ancestors of the viruses recently collected in China, the Netherlands, the United States and Chile. The presence of such reassortment emphasizes the ongoing evolution of the H13N8 viruses distributed in Europe, North and East Asia, North and South America and Australia. This study underscores the importance of the continued surveillance and research of less-studied influenza subtypes.

Habitat-dependent metabolic costs for a wild cold-water fish	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Bioenergetics models for fishes are useful for understanding ecological processes (e.g., survivorship, growth, and reproduction) and can also inform fisheries management. Yet, current bioenergetics models are unable to ascertain direct energetic costs associated with standard and active metabolism for wild, free-swimming fishes. The use of telemetry with accelerometer sensors, calibrated in the laboratory using swim tunnel respirometers, have made it possible to estimate field metabolic activity in wild fish. Our objectives were to determine seasonal thermal habitat use and habitat-dependent metabolic costs associated with standard, active, and maximum metabolism in a 1400 ha multibasin lake in Quebec, Canada. We implanted 47 wild, free-swimming Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush) with either acoustic transmitters equipped with temperature and depth sensors or an acceleration sensor. Three sets of water temperature loggers (one set for each basin) were deployed at 2, 4, 6, 10, and 18 or 20 m to measure seasonally available thermal habitat. Thermal profiles of lake water temperature varied among basins with the thermocline being 5 m in the smallest basin (north basin) and 7.5 m in the largest basin (east basin). Thermal habitat used by Lake Trout varied seasonally, coupled with seasonal and basin differences in standard and maximum metabolism. Daily active metabolism loosely followed seasonal changes in thermal habitat use but was largely unaffected by differences in thermal habitat use among capture basins. The theoretical scope-for-activity followed seasonal trends and was estimated to range between 47% and 74% of theoretical aerobic scope. Our observations suggest that available thermal habitats influence Lake Trout thermal habitat use, and thus metabolic costs associated with swimming. These changes in thermal habitats could have metabolic consequences for individuals in a population, resulting in altered fitness metrics (i.e., survival, growth, and/or reproduction). Reductions in the volume and availability of optimal thermal habitats for Lake Trout are likely to occur under climate change scenarios. Our study indicates that the species can adjust metabolic costs throughout the year even when thermal habitats appear to be limiting, which may inform future evidence-based management decisions.

Diverse response of shallow lake water levels to decadal weather patterns in a heterogeneous glacial Boreal Plains landscape	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												To examine the relative controls of landscape and climate on spatial variability, we measured water level dynamics of shallow lakes over two decades that represent both the heterogeneity of surficial geology classifications, and thus the potential range in surface and groundwater connectivity, and the long-term weather patterns of the Boreal Plain hydrogeoclimatic setting. Large ranges in shallow lakes water levels (between 0.25 and 2 m) were observed corresponding to extremes in precipitation relative to the long-term mean precipitation over the study period. We found low concurrence in water level dynamics among four detailed study lakes that received the same meteorological weather signal, but were located in different surficial geology texture classifications that incorporated important landscape parameters associated with lake water balance and storage. Surficial geology classification alone did not, however, distinguish between different ranges in lake water level measured in a broader synoptic survey of 26 lakes across the region. Thus, simple surficial geology classifications cannot alone be applied to classify Boreal Plain lake water level dynamics and other controls, notably landscape position, must also be considered. We further show that inter-annual variability in lake water levels was significantly greater than seasonal variability in this hydrogeoclimatic setting. This emphasizes the need for studies of sufficient length to capture weather extremes that include periods of wetting and drying, and demonstrates how observed magnitudes of water level variability, and lake function, can be an artefact of study length and initiation date. These findings provide a foundation to test and calibrate conceptual understanding of the wider controls of lake water levels to form holistic frameworks to mitigate ecological and societal impacts due to hydrological changes under climate and anthropogenic disturbance within and between hydrogeoclimatic settings.

In this study, we evaluated the water colour variability of three artificial mountain lakes located in a relatively small basin (Western Italian Alps) at high elevations, and related this variability to the local climate conditions of the hydrological basin to which they belong. We estimated the dominant wavelength (DW) of lake water from Sentinel-2 acquisitions for the period 2017-2022, performing a chromaticity analysis. We correlated DW with climatic parameters recorded by two automated weather stations. Average DW varies from 497 nm of Serru Lake and Agnel Lake to 512 nm of Lake Ceresole, where DW varies seasonally (variation of 75-100 nm in one year). During April-July, the DW of Lake Ceresole is significative correlated with air temperatures and snow cover (-0.8 and +0.8, respectively). During August-October, the relationship with temperature decreases to -0.5, and a correlation of 0.5 with the amount of rainfall appears. This work shows that mountain lake waters can exhibit variable quality (expressed here by water colour) in response to meteorological and hydrological conditions and events.

J	YEMANE, K				YEMANE, K			CONTRIBUTION OF LATE PERMIAN PALEOGEOGRAPHY IN MAINTAINING A TEMPERATE CLIMATE IN GONDWANA	NATURE												NUMERICAL simulations based on general circulation and energy-balance models consistently indicate that. the high latitudes of Gondwana experienced seasonal extremes in climate during the Late Permian period1-3. But palaeogeographic maps based on the distribution of climate-sensitive rocks4, palynological and palaeobotanical data5,6 and dicynodont fossil records7 all imply a temperate climate. The reason for this discrepancy has not been clear. Recently, it has emerged from studies of Upper Permian fluviolacustrine deposits throughout southern Africa that the geography was dominated by a series of giant lakes, perhaps interconnected within major fluvial frameworks8. Here I review these data and their implications for a temperate climate. I suggest that the discrepancy between the climate modelling results which indicate seasonal temperature extremes, and the increasing body of geological information documenting a temperate climate, may be explained by the fact that the palaeogeography used in the models does not take into account the existence of these lakes and rivers, which would have had a major influence on the regional climate. The results demonstrate the importance of incorporating accurate palaeogeographies into numerical modelling studies when attempting to reconstruct past climates.																			0028-0836					JAN 7	1993	361	6407					51	54		10.1038/361051a0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/361051a0													WOS:A1993KF71800043

Cr(III), Cr(VI), and total dissolved (<0.45-mu-m) Cr and total Cr concentration profiles were measured from January until November 1989 together with other redox sensitive species of N, Mn, Fe, and S. Cr(VI) was the predominant species even under anoxic conditions. Concentrations of Cr(VI) ranged from 1 to 4 nM. Reduction of Cr(VI) could be observed only in extremely reducing conditions in the presence of S(-II) and Fe(II). It was concluded that a suitable reducing agent had to be present for the reduction of CR(VI) to Cr(III) to take place and that organic reductants most probably played a minor role. In addition, calculations indicated the occurrence of a slow removal process, with a half-time of 100-230 d, that reduced Cr(VI) concentrations by either adsorption or reduction in both oxic and suboxic waters. Dissolved free Cr(III) species were not detected, which was explained by the strong tendency of this species to bind with surfaces and organic ligands and colloids. Even in oxic conditions, the sediments did not appear to be a source of Cr(VI).					; Sigg, Laura/AAI-3504-2020	Sigg, Laura/0000-0002-2210-2951; 													0024-3590					MAR	1992	37	2					315	321		10.4319/lo.1992.37.2.0315	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1992.37.2.0315													WOS:A1992JD02300009

The species population is on a continued decline for the past 70 years. This study aimed at developing a portfolio on the species during its reproductive migration to Shiotsuo River, a Lake Biwa tributary, by using a combination of biometric measurements and stable isotope ratios in its tissues. Hasu fish were collected monthly, from May to September 2019, using cast nets. The biometric measurements: wet weight, standard length, gonad weight and gut content were collected and used to calculate the gonado-somatic index (GSI) and Fulton's condition constant (K) and determine the feeding habits of Hasu fish. Carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios (delta 13C and delta 15N) in slow-changing muscle and fast-changing mucus tissues of Hasu fish were also used to determine recent diet change. At the beginning of the reproductive season, fewer females than males were caught; however, the number of females increased as the season progressed. On average, males were larger than females. Migrating individuals were healthy (K > 1) and over 37% larger in length than those in the 1960s. Gut content analysis revealed, for the first time, Hasu fish feeding in the rivers, primarily on Ayu fish, during the reproductive migration. delta 13C and delta 15N in muscle and mucus indicated a recent change in diet, i.e., from Lake Biwa to Shiotsuo River, with differences in the onset of feeding (and consequently upstream migration) between sexes and individuals. For the effective conservation of Hasu fish in the other tributaries where Ayu fish traps block other fishes' migration, we recommend having the rivers open from June to September to cover its variable timing in the recruitment of reproductive individuals.

Coastal wetlands as sources of Escherichia coli to the nearshore of Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Beaches within the Laurentian Great Lakes Basin are frequently contaminated with fecal bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), leading to beach closures due to potential health risks. Although climatic drivers and landscape sources of E. coli to nearshore areas are well established, the role of coastal wetlands as sources of coliform bacteria remains a knowledge gap. We investigated E. coli abundance and dynamics in four coastal wetlands (3 drowned river mouths and 1 barrier beach lagoon) on the north-shore of Lake Ontario for over a decade (2009-2018). Applying a general additive model revealed significant seasonal, interannual, spatial, interseasonal, and interannual spatial trends for E. coli across the study area. Additionally, we observed celled sites (i. e., natural ponds in wetlands) to have a higher partial effect on E. coli concentrations across the study period, indicating these wetland features may be an important reservoir for endogenously sourced E. coli. To determine whether increased wave activity, indicative of seiche events, influenced E. coli concentrations in the wetland and the nearshore of Lake Ontario, we developed a local structural equation model to represent the entire study area. Seiche events were identified to significantly increase suspended solid loadings, which in turn resulted in significantly (p-value < 0.05) elevated E. coli concentrations in both coastal wetlands and Lake Ontario. In addition to watershed inputs, results demonstrated that coastal wetlands significantly (p-value < 0.05) influence E. coli concentrations in the nearshore of Lake Ontario, and should be considered in nearshore water quality assessments and mitigation efforts.					; Kirkwood, Andrea/B-2738-2013	Harrow-Lyle, Tyler/0000-0003-0985-4830; 													0380-1330					APR	2024	50	2							102292	10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102292	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102292		MAR 2024											WOS:001222988800001

Implementing Effects-Based Water Quality Criteria for Eutrophication in Beaver Lake, Arkansas: Linking Standard Development and Assessment Methodology	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												To address water quality standards needed to prevent accelerated eutrophication, many states in the United States have developed effects-based standards related to nutrients. In many cases, this has resulted in specific standards for Secchi transparency (ST) and phytoplankton biomass measured as sestonic chlorophyll a (chl-a). The state of Arkansas recently adopted its first effects-based water quality criteria for Beaver Lake in northwestern Arkansas, which was a growing-season geometric mean chl-a <8 mu g L-1 and an annual average ST >1.1 m. However, the adopted standard did not have a predefined assessment methodology that outlined the frequency and duration of potential exceedances. This study used hydrologic frequency analysis to estimate the risk of exceeding these water quality standards using measured and modeled data from Beaver Lake from 2001 to 2014. Beaver Lake conformed to common models in reservoir limnology in that ST was least and chl-a was greatest in the river-reservoir transition zone and decreased in the downstream direction toward the dam. Greater chl-a and lesser ST was clearly related to total phosphorus concentrations along this gradient. Thus, the risk of exceeding the water quality criteria decreased in a downstream direction. There were substantial differences in the probability of exceeding the adopted water quality criteria based on both spatial and temporal variation in the potential assessment periods. Based on the way the standard was developed and the risk of exceeding these standards derived from data collected before the standards were in place, we recommend that a minimum of half of the years assessed be necessary to result in a water quality violation. A number of other assessment considerations are presented that could provide flexibility to regulatory agencies in assessing water quality standards.

Samples were collected in the open water for 14 consecutive days, in the high and low water periods. Densities were higher in the lake, chiefly in the low water period. During the studied period, changes in species dominance were observed. Rotifer abundance showed that higher variability occured during the high water period in both environments. Rotifer abundance showed high variability in the river during the sampling days. In the lake, fluctuation was related to the hydrological periods. Rotifer abundance fluctuations in the lake were influenced by regional factors (fluviometric level); and in the river, by local factors (flow).

Both surveys revealed a distinctive shore-parallel pattern, characterized by a south-eastward trend and a second transport direction toward the northwest and southwest. As physical support for the tracer patterns, vertical profiles of currents near the outfall were monitored during four time periods from 1991 to 2000. Current data indicated the flow at the outfall was complicated; there was flow in all directions at all depths. However, the cumulative surface flow followed the prevailing wind (toward the east and northeast), while the bottom flow was approximately in opposition to the surface flow (to the west-northwest). Combining this circulation structure with the seasonal variation in buoyancy of the effluent discharge, the bi-directional transport pattern interpreted from the tracer distribution could be explained using a model in which the STP effluent plume was advected by local current at a position in the water column where the plume was stable. During January through August when the effluent was denser than ambient harbour water, it tended to be advected by flows lower in the water column moving the plume toward the north to west and into the central basin. During the rest of the year, it was lighter and more influenced by surface currents, which advected the plume onshore (toward the east and northeast) where it was deflected by shoreline geometry in a shore-parallel direction toward the southeast.																			0380-1330						2002	28	1					77	90		10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70564-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70564-9													WOS:000174587400008
J	Rzepecki, M				Rzepecki, M			Wetland zones along lake shores as barrier systems: Field and experimental research on nutrient retention and dynamics	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Seasonal variation in nutrient (DP, N-NO3, DKN) concentrations of subsurface waters passing through a wetland zone were examined in the Jorka river-lake system (Masurian Lakeland) over the periods from April through November of 1996-1998. The study was conducted in three wetlands: two located on the lake shores and one bordering on the Jorka river. They represent typical sites and vegetation for lakeland regions. The field study was conducted with the use of piezometers situated along transects, Laboratory experiments were carried out with the use of undisturbed soil cores taken from wetlands. In most cases, mean nutrient concentrations in subsurface waters steadily declined from 20% to 90% when passing through wetland zones in the direction from the land, especially within the first 5-7 m section. The laboratory experiments showed that under reduced conditions of water-saturated soils, denitrification may be responsible for nitrogen removal. But under these conditions, dissolved mineral phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen were released.																			1505-2249						2002	50	4					527	541																WOS:000180144900008

Seasonal variations in plankton concentrations of Aroclor 1254/1260 were observed to range from 3.25 to 35.2 mu g/kg (wet wgt.). In order to compare the relative differences of chemical activity (fugacity), at the base of the pelagic food web with that of the benthic food web, fugacity ratios were determined for chemicals in the plankton and the sediment. If the two phases are in chemical equilibrium, the fugacity of chemicals in the two phases should be equal, or fp/fs = 1. Congener specific plankton:sediment fugacity ratios (fp/fs), however, ranged from 0.05 to 0.63, and revealed a significant gradient of chemical activity between the plankton and the sediment. Trophic dilution in the pelagic food web, where algal growth rates exceed chemical kinetic rates, is concluded to be an important process in regulating contaminant exposure dynamics in the pelagic food web of the western basin of Lake Erie. It is hypothesized that higher fugacities at the base of the benthic food web can influence chemical concentrations in the upper trophic levels as a result of coupling between the benthic and pelagic food webs.																			0380-1330						2000	26	1					65	73		10.1016/S0380-1330(00)70673-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(00)70673-3													WOS:000086696200006

Picophytoplankton biomass (as chlorophyll a) in meso-, eu-, and hypertrophic lakes was significantly higher than those observed in oligotrophic lakes. However, picophytoplankton biomass increased significantly with increased total P concentrations in all systems excluding hypertrophic lakes. Picophytoplankton contribution to total chlorophyll a content was significantly higher in oligo- and mesotrophic lakes than in eu- and hypertrophic lakes and was inversely correlated with total P concentrations in lake water. Picophytoplankton contribution to the total phytoplankton biomass was positively (r = 0.54, n = 42, P = 0.0003) correlated with the total N : total P ratio of lake waters. Each lake trophic type, with the exception of hypertrophic lakes, showed this trend, although the correlation was not significant. We suggest that picophytoplankton contribution is influenced by the total N : total P ratio rather than lake trophic state; however, picophytoplankton were of little importance in hypertrophic lakes.

J	SCHOLZ, CA; FINNEY, BP				SCHOLZ, CA; FINNEY, BP			LATE QUATERNARY SEQUENCE STRATIGRAPHY OF LAKE MALAWI (NYASA), AFRICA	SEDIMENTOLOGY												High resolution seismic data, multichannel seismic data and sediment cores were used to examine the Songwe Sequence, the uppermost of four depositional sequences identifiable on multichannel seismic data from Lake Malawi (Nyasa). The sequence has a maximum thickness of about 115 m in two areas of the lake, but is typically less than 70 m thick over most of the basin. The sequence is distributed along the entire length of the 560 km long lake, and is concentrated in three main depocentres. C-14 age dates from sediment piston cores are extrapolated to provide an age estimate of about 78 000 yr BP for the oldest sediments within the Songwe Sequence. In the North and Central bathymetric basins of the lake, high resolution seismic data indicate a dynamic depositional environment, dominated by turbidity and mass flow deposits. Seismic data from the southern basin show acoustically transparent sediments with relatively low amplitude internal reflections, indicative of pelagic and hemipelagic sedimentation. In many areas the Songwe Sequence is underlain by a pronounced angular unconformity, suggestive of a significant, prolonged, low lake stage prior to deposition of the sequence. Seismic reflectors within the Songwe Sequence can be correlated to younger low lake stages identified from sediment core data. Major late Quaternary low lake level stages in Lake Malawi, interpreted from features identified in the seismic data and sediment core analyses, are tentatively interpreted at 6000 to 10 000 yr BP, 28 000 to > 40 000 yr BP, and prior to 78 000 yr BP. Budget calculations indicate mean sediment concentrations from catchment runoff during the period of deposition of the Songwe Sequence to be about 190 mg l-1, comparable to estimates of modem rainy season discharges from the major river systems. Erosion rates within the drainage basin are estimated to be higher than the African average by a factor of three or more, probably due to the high relief within the Lake Malawi catchment.																			0037-0746					FEB	1994	41	1					163	179		10.1111/j.1365-3091.1994.tb01397.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.1994.tb01397.x													WOS:A1994MW58200009
J	MARTINOVA, MV				MARTINOVA, MV			NITROGEN AND PHOSPHOR COMPOUNDS IN BOTTOM SEDIMENTS - MECHANISMS OF ACCUMULATION, TRANSFORMATION AND RELEASE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This paper is an overview of Russian literature dealing with the accumulation, the transformations and the release of phosphate and nitrogen compounds in a great number of Russian lakes and reservoirs. A considerable data bank has been analysed. Special attention is given to the relations of N- and P-accumulation with the input and transformation of organic carbon, as well as to the release mechanisms, often in relation to eutrophication of the lakes and reservoirs. It is shown that the major input of organic matter into the sediments comes from autochthonous material, and is usually > 70%. The relative importance of phytoplankton and macrophytes as sources of organic matter is discussed; it appears that trophic state, depth and other factors may have a large influence on this ratio. In shallow eutrophic lakes macrophytes may be the source of organic matter, which source can amount to 1.5-2.5 times that of phytoplankton. It is also shown that the C/N ratio is not a good indicator of the source of the organic matter, because their C/N ratios often are not very different. The decomposition rate of organic matter was analysed; it depends on trophic state and other factors. Sediment N accumulation is mostly (> 90%) in organic form, and depends on nitrogen and organic matter inputs coming from phytoplankton or macrophytes. A correlation coefficient of 0.9-0.95 was found in 176 lakes. In 113 lakes the N accumulation was 0.11 x C accumulation, with C/N ratios between 7.4 and 12.9. Ammonification was rather constant in different groups of lakes; values were often about 20-25 mg m-2 d-1. The presence of the different forms of nitrogen in interstitial water and in adsorbed forms is discussed. The N in interstitial water is usually in the form of NH3. Sediment P-accumulation is usually in inorganic form and is related to primary production. Three different groups of sediments could be distinguished with C/P ratios of 31-100, of 101-350 and > 350. In hard water lakes P sedimentation was found to be 0.3-0.5 times that in soft water lakes with comparable primary production. The relative occurrence of apatite, non-apatite and residual P in sediments was calculated. In the interstitial water the P concentration appeared to be controlled by the input and decomposition of organic matter. The concentration of phosphate dissolved in the interstitial water of the top 2 cm layer is often 10-100 times lower than that of the dissolved N. The concentrations of interstitial phosphate are from a few mug l-1 up to 15 mg l-1, but the higher concentrations occur only rarely. Different types of vertical profiles of P compounds in the sediments were shown to be related with the presence of an oxidised zone, the presence of clay etc. Autochthonous apatite and non-apatite phosphates are more mobile than the allochthonous ones and are in equilibrium with interstitial phosphate. Accumulation of autochthonous apatite in sediments is controlled by decomposition of organic matter and accumulation of carbonates. The seasonal changes of Tot-N and Tot-P were analysed and the different controlling factors are described. The release processes were quantified by calculation with Fick's formula and by an experimental approach in situ. The first approach underestimated sometimes the results obtained experimentally, while the calculation was not valid if nitrification was active. The calculations for P often disagreed with the experimental results. Therefore, a flux model is proposed, based on the different transformation processes and release. The model takes into account the different upward fluxes and predicts these fluxes as function of the accumulation and external loading. Four indicators have been chosen to classify the release of plant nutrients: (1) annual internal load; (2) correlation between internal and external load; (3) correlation between release and accumulation; (4) relative contribution of the release from the bottom to the total quantity in the water.																			0018-8158					FEB 12	1993	252	1					1	22		10.1007/BF00000124	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00000124													WOS:A1993KX97000002
J	Pálffy, K; Smeti, E				Palffy, Karoly; Smeti, Evangelia			Combined effect of warming, nutrients, and species pool size on the seasonal variability of phytoplankton composition: A modeling perspective	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The anticipated long-term rise in temperature can have numerous effects on freshwater phytoplankton, however, there is a great deal of uncertainty about how biogeochemical processes modify community functioning under a warming climate. Previous works regarding a large shallow lake and a mesocosm study showed a positive relationship between the temporal variability of phytoplankton composition and mean temperature, which might be a sign of warming-stimulated instability in ecosystem processes. To elucidate whether these observations are part of a more general phenomenon, we combined a numerical model describing the dependence of algal growth on temperature and nutrient concentration with a multispecies, multi-nutrient model. We ran simulations representative of changes in phytoplankton communities with randomized initial species composition under different temperature scenarios (current annual temperature pattern increased with 1 degrees C, 2 degrees C, or 3 degrees C), various levels of nitrogen and phosphorus supply and different degrees of temporal variability in those supplies. The model outputs showed that seasonal variability in composition can be enhanced by warming through the mechanistic links between nutrient availability, temperature, and species-specific growth rates, but the rate of increase is also dependent on nutrient ratios and the size of the species pool. Moreover, temporal variability in nutrient loads also enhanced compositional variability, but the rate of increase also depended on the level of nutrient supply. The results of our study hint that the impact of climate change and eutrophication on phytoplankton dynamics can be more intricate than spatiotemporally limited field or experimental observations would suggest.

Quantitative analyses are presented for chironomids, cladocerans, cyclopoid copepods, gastropods, water mites (Hydracarina), ostracods, and trichopterans. R2 values for the regression equations ranged from 0.43 to 0.81. The abundance of invertebrates was best related to the biomass of separate plant species, but equations based only on total plant biomass sometimes had equivalent R2 values. In general, the abundance of phytophilous invertebrates was postively related to areal plant biomass, sediment organic matter, and lake trophic status and negatively related to depth. The abundance of phytophilous invertebrates generally rose throughout the sampling season. The sign of the relationship with sediment water content, however, varied among invertebrate taxa. Macrophyte beds with high areal plant biomass, in lakes with high total phosphorus concentration, support the greatest abundance of potential invertebrate food for fish and waterfowl.

J	STABEL, HH				STABEL, HH			CALCITE PRECIPITATION IN LAKE CONSTANCE - CHEMICAL-EQUILIBRIUM, SEDIMENTATION, AND NUCLEATION BY ALGAE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Seasonal shifts in calcium carbonate solution equilibria in the limnetic zone of Lake Constance were documented between 1981 and 1983. Except during mixing times, lake water was supersaturated with respect to calcite; epilimnetic supersaturation maxima were closely related to changes in pH. Sedimentation of calcium from the lower boundary of the euphotic zone to the lake bottom was also assessed. The daily sedimentation flux for calcium during the season varied over three orders of magnitude. Differences in the calcium content of sediments trapped at various depths were insignificant. Sedimentation rates of titanium were used as tracers for the fluxes of calcium bound on allochthonous clastic material. Lacustrine calcite, precipitation (39-49% of the total sedimentation rate) was obtained by subtracting fluxes of allochthonous Ca from the rates of total Ca sedimentation. Calcium supersaturation maxima were not in phase seasonally with maximum fluxes of autochthonous Ca. Instead, calcite precipitation was associated with the occurrence of Stephanodiscus hantzschii, Fragilaria crotonensis, Asterionella formosa, Chlorella sp., Pandorina morum, and Mougeotia thylespora, indicating that calcite formation was triggered by heterogeneous nucleation induced by certain algal species.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	1986	31	5					1081	1093		10.4319/lo.1986.31.5.1081	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1986.31.5.1081													WOS:A1986E892400015

The surface water of the RVLB comprises streamflow and an open water system. The model was configured with 13 catchments and a monthly time series of 1981-2022, to address the spatial variability of rainfall-runoff interaction. Statistical performance indicators were used to evaluate the accuracy of the model in simulating streamflows and the results showed that the coefficient of determination (R-2) ranges from 0.82 to 0.93, Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) ranges from 0.68 to 0.86, percentage of bias (PBIAS) ranges from -9.45 to -1.85, standard deviation ratio (RSR) ranges from 0.35 to 0.59, and index of agreement (IA) ranges from 0.62 to 0.84. The available surface water for abstraction is 358 million cubic meters (MCM) available as lake water abstraction and 6,534 MCM as streamflow water, making it a total surface water flow of 6,892 MCM. Considering the temporal distribution of the surface water sources, 67.5% is available in the rainy season, June-October and 32.5% during the dry period, November-May in the basin.

The daily average of PM10 concentrations ranged from 20.48 to 53.10 mu g/m3 and thus did not exceed the daily average maximum permissible level of PM10 (100 mu g/m3) established in the Colombia standard at any station. The concentrations of nine water-soluble ions in PM10 (Cl-, NO3-, PO43-, SO42- Na+, NH4+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+) were determined. The ions under analysis, SO42-, Na+, and NH4+ had the highest concentrations. Combined, they accounted for 75% of the mass of water-soluble ions in a total of 210 samples. The SO42- concentrations in PM10 significantly correlated with suaod550 (r ranging from 0.57 to 0.66), emphasizing the strong effect of suaod550 from Venezuela (Lake Maracaibo) on central and northern Colombia. These results demonstrate that the effects of local sulfate emissions near monitoring sites can be predicted and assessed using satellite data.

The model uses enthalpy instead of temperature as predictive variable, which will help to deal with the phase change process and to design an efficient numerical scheme for obtaining the solution more easily. The performance of the model and the rationality of taking convection mixing into the consideration are validated by using observed data of Kinneret Lake in Israel and Lower Two Medicine Lake in Montana State in America. The comparison of model results with observed data indicates that the model presented here is capable of describing the physical process of water mass and energy between the water body (lake and wetland) and atmosphere. Comparison of the result from wetland with shallow and deep lakes under the same forcing conditions shows that the evaporation from wetland is much greater than that from lakes, which accords with the real observation fact and physical mechanism.

Thermistor chain data assimilation to improve hydrodynamic modeling skill in stratified lakes and reservoirs	JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING												Results from a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model of a stratified lake show that the computed structure of the pycnocline changed rapidly due to numerical diffusion, thus altering the vertical mixing dynamics and introducing a positive feedback that quickly drives model predictions off course. To negate the numerical diffusion a pycnocline filtering method is proposed that assimilates high-resolution thermistor chain data and adaptively adjusts to minimize the discrepancy between observed and computed temperatures. The adaptive pycnocline filter ensures that the computed temperature gradients in the metalimnion at the position of the thermistor chain remain within the bounds of the measured values so the computation preserves the spectrum of internal wave motions that trigger diapycnal mixing events in the deeper reaches of the lake.																			0733-9429	1943-7900				AUG	2008	134	8					1123	1135		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2008)134:8(1123)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2008)134:8(1123)													WOS:000257763000009

Assessing the resilience of stormwater ponds under climate change: A case study on Grace Lake, Florida, unveiling flood control and water quality implications	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Stormwater ponds have emerged as a crucial solution in Florida to accommodate excess runoff from new developments and mitigate environmental pollution. Climate change affects rainfall and evapotranspiration, likely altering the hydrologic process. It is unclear how effective stormwater ponds will be in a changing climate, especially where surface water and groundwater interaction is highly expected. To address these concerns, this study employs a fully coupled surface water and groundwater model that was calibrated for the Grace Lake, located in central Florida. Utilizing the Multi-Model Ensemble method and GCM data, future rainfall projections were generated for the mid-century (2040-2070). The results indicate a projected 13 % increase in rainfall for the mid-century under the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCP 4.5). This increase led to a rise of 13 cm in the seasonal high water elevation of Grace Lake, reducing its reliability as a flood control mechanism by 13 %. Moreover, downstream areas from the lake are expected to experience higher flood stages in the future, with the duration of road flooding extending from less than three days (base period) to approximately seven days (future period). This increase in surface runoff raises concerns for water quality, with nitrogen and phosphorus loads projected to surge up to 67 % in the future period.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				APR	2024	633								130987	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.130987	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.130987		MAR 2024											WOS:001202710200001

Rates of embryonic and post-embryonic development for Bythotrephes cederstroemi from Lakes Erie, Huron and Michigan are represented almost equally well by three empirical models across water temperatures ranging from about 12-22 degrees C, but at lower temperatures two of the competing models fail and an exponential development rate model proves most robust. 2. Clutch masses of parthenogenic females can greatly exceed the tissue mass of the mother. Clutch size is strongly correlated with the mass of reproductive adults, accounting for over 90% of the variation among individuals. Hence, the mass gain from neonate to reproductive adult can be estimated directly from clutch size. 3. Tissue stoichiometries, respiration quotients and stoichiometries of C and N metabolism were determined experimentally, extending the predictions of existing respiration and growth models. 4. A predictive model for growth and production by the invertebrate predator has advantages over previous model formulations owing to our expanded calibration data base. The model is presented in a modular design that is easily upgraded as additional calibration data become available.					; Bilkovic, Donna/A-8343-2009	Bilkovic, Donna Marie/0000-0003-2002-1901; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				OCT	1997	38	2					343	352		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1997.00246.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1997.00246.x													WOS:A1997YF50700009

One hypothesis for this decline is that low light availability may have decreased net photosynthesis to the extent that overwintering tubers were not formed. Following the decline, light availability remained low. To determine what light levels would be necessary for the re-establishment of Vallisneria in the Upper Mississippi River, the long-term growth of plants in a backwater lake and in an experimental pond was measured while the surface and subsurface light were monitored continuously. Plants grown from tubers transplanted to 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 m depth in the lake grew and produced tubers only at 0.5 m depth (9% of surface light). At 1.0 m, light availability was less than 1% of the surface light. Plants grown from tubers in experimental ponds with four shade treatments (2, 5, 9 and 25% of surface light) for the same growing period produced replacement-weight tubers in 9% light. For a longer growing season, plants also produced replacement-weight tubers in treatments with at least 5% of surface light. An average light-extinction coefficient of 4.64 m(-1) was calculated for the backwater lake based on continuous data collected during 94 days during the growing season from eight widely separated sites. Using equations based on the average extinction coefficient for the lake and average leaf lengths of plants grown in experimental ponds, we predict that in years with comparable turbidity, plants grown from locally collected tubers will grow and produce replacement tubers only at depths of 0.8 m or less.

J	Böllmann, J; Martienssen, M				Boellmann, Joerg; Martienssen, Marion			Seasonal Variability of Cultivable Nitrate-Reducing and Denitrifying Bacteria and Functional Gene Copy Number in Fresh Water Lake	MICROORGANISMS												This study describes the seasonal course of denitrifying and nitrate-reducing bacteria in a dimictic mesotrophic lake (Lake Scharmutzelsee, Brandenburg, Germany) within a three-year period from 2011 to 2013. The bacterial cell numbers were quantified by the fluorescence microscopy, most probable number (MPN) and PCR-dependent quantification of the chromosomal 16S rDNA and of the nirS and nirK gene copy number. The highest seasonal differences (up to three orders of magnitudes) have been measured using MPN in the epilimnion. This variation was not reflected by PCR-dependent approaches or direct microscopical enumeration. At adverse conditions (low temperature and/or low nitrate concentrations), the differences between MPN and gene copy numbers increased by up to five orders of magnitudes and decreased to one magnitude at favourable environmental conditions. These results can be explained best by an increasing ratio of viable but not cultivable (VBNC) cells or dead cells at impairing conditions. In the hypolimnion, the courses of MPN and nir gene copy numbers were similar. This can be explained by a higher feeding pressure and therefore smaller amounts of dormant cells. In the pelagial in general, the total cell numbers enumerated by either microscopical or molecular approaches were similar. In the sediment, more than 99% of the DNA was obviously not related to viable bacteria but was rather DNA in dead cells or adsorbed to particle surfaces.

MODIS and passive microwave data are widely used to monitor lake ice changes with high temporal resolution. However, the low spatial resolutions make it difficult to effectively quantify the freeze -melt dynamics of lakes. This work used Sentinel -1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to derive highr esolution ice maps (about 6 days), then with the aid of Sentinel -2 optical images to quantify freeze -melt processes in three typical lakes on the TP (e.g. Selin Co, Ayakekumu Lake, and Nam Co). The results showed that three lakes had an average annual ice period of 125-157 days and a complete ice cover period of 72-115 days, from 2018 to 2022. They exhibit different ice phenology patterns. Nam Co is characterized by repeated episodes of freezing, melting, and refreezing, resulting in a prolonged freeze-up period. Meanwhile, the break-up period of Nam Co lasts for a longer duration (about 19 days), and the break-up exhibits a smooth process. Similarly, Ayakekumu Lake showed more significant inter -annual fluctuations in the freeze-up period, with deviations of up to 28 days observed among different years. Compared to the other two lakes, Selin Co experienced a relatively short freeze-up and break-up period. In short, Sentinel -1 SAR data can effectively monitor the weekly and seasonal variations in lake ice on the TP. Particularly, this data facilitates quantification of the freeze -melt dynamics.					; duan, zheng/D-6409-2011	Duan, Zheng/0000-0002-4411-8196; 													1672-6316	1993-0321				MAR	2024	21	3					805	819		10.1007/s11629-023-8401-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-023-8401-2													WOS:001239735900008

By selecting seven indicators from three aspects: hydrology, habitat, and social services, a seasonal river health assessment indicator system was constructed for the Tabu River basin. The weights of the indicators were determined using the analytic hierarchy process and entropy weight method, and a classification standard for seasonal river health was established. The health status of the Tabu River in 2021 was evaluated accordingly. The results revealed that the upstream, midstream, and downstream reaches of the Tabu River were categorized as healthy, sub-healthy, and diseased, respectively, with poor hydrological conditions being the primary concern. The satisfaction level of ecological flow within the basin was low, accompanied by deep groundwater levels and water scarcity issues, aligning with the actual situation. This indicator system effectively reflects the true state of seasonal river ecosystems. Based on the evaluation results, measures such as establishing ecological water storage projects and adjusting agricultural planting structures were proposed to alleviate the impacts caused by water scarcity. Additionally, implementing river and lake management systems, water resource protection measures, and water-saving technologies can directly regulate the pressures imposed on rivers by human socio-economic activities, thus alleviating regional water resource shortages and promoting the health of rivers and regional water resources. These findings provide scientific decision-making support for the management of seasonal river basins and the maintenance of river health.

Taking the Simiyu catchment of the Lake Victoria basin as the study area, we set up a NPS model based on the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). Furthermore, the rationality of this model is verified with the field-measured data. The results manifest that: (1) the temporal variation of NPS load is consistent with the variation pattern of rainfall, the average monthly output of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in the rainy season was 1360.6 t and 336.2 t, respectively, while in the dry season was much lower, only 13.5 t and 3.0 t, respectively; (2) in view of spatial distribution among 32 sub-basins, TN load ranged from 2.051 to 24.288 kg/ha with an average load of 12.940 kg/ha, and TP load ranged from 0.263 to 8.103 kg/ha with an average load of 3.321 kg/ha during the 16-month study period; (3) Among the land use types, the cropland contributed the highest proportion of TN and TP pollution with 50.28% and 76.29%, respectively, while the effect of forest on NPS was minimal with 0.05% and 0.02% for TN and TP, respectively. (4) Moreover, the event mean concentration (EMC) values of different land use types have been derived based on the SWAT model, which are key parameters for the application of the long-term hydrological impact assessment (L-THIA) model. Therefore, this study facilitates applying the L-THIA model to other similar data-deficient catchments in view of its relatively lower data requirement.					chen, shuang/OMQ-3134-2025; Zhang, Peiyao/LIA-9342-2024; Kimirei, Ismael/F-7385-2012	Kimirei, Ismael/0000-0002-1101-5262; chen, shuang/0000-0001-6308-0958														2073-4441				MAR	2024	16	6							800	10.3390/w16060800	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16060800													WOS:001192684600001

Various statistical methods and indices were employed to assess precipitation and temperature patterns in the region. The findings indicated a statistically non-significant increasing trend in rainfall across the sub-basin, with values ranging from 1.64 to 5.37 mm/year. In terms of temperature, there was an increase trend observed, but it was also not statistically significant. The seasonality index ranged between 0.87 and 1.03, indicating different rainfall distribution patterns. In 36.69% of the sub-basin, rainfall occurs in marked seasonal patterns with a long dry season, and the remaining (63.31%) is concentrated in 3 or fewer months, indicating a different rainfall distribution pattern. In addition, the study assessed the precipitation concentration and found that 57.5% of the rainfall data exhibited a strong irregular concentration, 41.5% showed an irregular concentration, and 1% exhibited a moderate concentration. The study underscores the presence of climate variability and trends in the Tana sub-basin, emphasizing the need to align agricultural and water resource management practices with the observed climate variability.					; Dzwairo, Bloodless/AFS-8550-2022; Sahlu, Dejene/AAU-1585-2021	Sahlu, Dejene/0000-0001-7253-9150; Dzwairo, Bloodless/0000-0002-0127-2978; Tesfaw, Bewuketu Abebe/0000-0001-7341-9089; 													2040-2244	2408-9354				MAR	2024	15	3					1282	1299		10.2166/wcc.2024.577	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wcc.2024.577		FEB 2024											WOS:001174001500001

H.			Late Quaternary ostracode stratigraphy of Mono Lake (California, USA): evidence for benthic ecosystem sensitivity to climate change	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												The response of aquatic ecosystems in the Sierra Nevada (California, USA) to late Quaternary hydroclimate changes remains mostly unknown. Mono Lake, a large endorheic lake just east of the Sierra Nevada, contains an expanded archive of laminated sediments that can be used to examine the response of benthos to environmental changes. Fossil ostracodes from a radiocarbon-dated core were used to examine paleoecologic changes from similar to 16.6 to 4.3k cal a bp. Seven species were identified, with the co-occurrence of Limnocythere ceriotuberosa and Limnocythere staplini indicating a large SO42--rich lake in the Pleistocene. The Younger Dryas was complex, with Fabaeformiscandona caudata reflecting a cold and deep lake similar to 13.0-12.2k cal a bp, followed by an interval of extensive littoral habitat from similar to 12.2-11.6k cal a bp. Ostracode diversity, valves g(-1) and the ratio of adult:juvenile valves declined after similar to 10.7k cal a bp due to regression, altered hydrochemistry and seasonal anoxia. Strong seasonality during the Early Holocene is suggested by the presence of reworked ostracodes and macrocharcoal, delivered to Mono Lake by erosion of ancient lake beds in the basin. A depauperate ostracode fauna in the Middle Holocene suggests a strong sensitivity to drought in this ecosystem, which has implications for biodiversity in the future.

Thus, this paper aims to analyze the responses of a dry forest to a dam after 15 years. For this, 20 random samples of 40 trees were made, 10 close to the lakeshore and 10 distant from it, by applying the central square point method. Close to the dam, we found higher values regarding basal area, number of trees, number of evergreen trees, and zoochoric syndrome, but there were lower values of Shannon's diversity index. Therefore, the impacts of the dam after 15 years caused several changes to the tree community. The greater basal area close to the dam suggests that water deficit during the dry season was decreased and plants have thicker trunks. On the other hand, this sector had much more zoochoric syndrome and a larger number of evergreen trees than plots which are distant from water, suggesting changes with regard to the community's ecological functions. Furthermore, structural floristic data shows that the sector close to the dam is less similar to other deciduous forests within the same geographical region than the sector distant from water, thus providing evidence of the impacts of dams on the tree community.

Tecuitlapa Sur is shallow, seasonally-astatic, warm, mesosaline, and soda-alkaline. The physical, chemical and biological variables were determined monthly for a yearly cycle. Tecuitlapa Sur displayed a seasonal patterns of dilution (June-August) and concentration (September-November) phases. Salinity and pH were the most important parameters explaining environmental variance. The BMC consisted of two species: Culicoides occidentalis sonorensis (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) and Tanypus Apelopia sp. (Diptera: Chironomidae). C. occidentalis was the most important species both numerically and in biomass (greater than or equal to95%). Annual density (mean +/- sd) of C. occidentalis (1 141 082 +/- 2 765 879 ind. m(-2), n = 120) was notably higher than other reported for other saline water bodies. However, the mean annual density of T. Apelopia (6782 +/- 8310 ind. m(-2), n = 120) was similar to other saline lakes. Seasonal abundance and biomass dynamics of the BMC showed an increasing trend until October (T. Apelopia) and November (C. occidentalis), when massive emergence occurred, just before the lake dried out. Contrary to most temporal waters, Tecuitlapa Sur did not show taxonomic or trophic succession. C. occidentalis, a transient detritivore, dominated over T. Apelopia, a resident predator during the wet period.

Diets of these two fish species were generally similar, although white perch tended to use more zooplankton, while yellow perch consumed more Chironomidae. Sphaeriidae, and fishes. In other instances, competition apparently led to resource partitioning that resulted from differences in ontogenetic feeding requirements and mouth position between white perch and yellow perch.																			0270-5060					MAR	1994	9	1					29	35		10.1080/02705060.1994.9664424	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1994.9664424													WOS:A1994NE88300005

The short term, seasonal and long term water level dynamics of lakes Erie and Ontario are discussed. Multiplicative, seasonal ARIMA models are developed for lakes Erie and Ontario using standardized, monthly mean level data for the period 1900 to 1986. The most appropriate model identified for each lake had the general form: (1 0 1)(0 1 1)12. The data for each lake were subdivided by time periods (1900 to 1942; 1943 to 1986) and the model coefficients estimated for the subdivided data were similar, indicating general model stability for the entire period of record. The models estimated for the full data sets were used to forecast levels 1,2,3, and 6 months ahead for a period of high levels (1984 to 1986). The average absolute forecast error for Lake Erie was 0.049m, 0.076m, 0.091m and 0.128m for the 1, 2,3, and 6 month forecasts, respectively. The average absolute forecast error for Lake Ontario was 0.058m, 0.095m, 0.120m and 0.136m for the 1,2,3, and 6 month forecasts, respectively. The ARIMA models provide additional information on water level time series structure and dynamics. The models also could be coordinated with current forecasting methods, possibly improving forecasting accuracy.

The sites were Alegarrobo, Concepcion, Maiquillahue Bay, Dona Sebastiana Island (Chalcao channel at Chiloe) and Magdalena Island (Straits of Magellan). We found differences among the sites: Kelp Gull eggs from Chiloe and Algarrobo had the greatest concentrations of mercury (about 170 ng g(-1) fresh weight). Residues of DDT were greatest in eggs from Algarrobo and Maiquillahue Bay, those of PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) greatest at Algarrobo and Concepcion. HCB had highest levels at Concepcion. Considering all organochlorines, samples from Algarrobo had the highest concentrations, those from Chiloe the lowest. In consequence we found a geographical pattern from north to south, i.e., from areas with nr eater to less er human impact. In comparison with other studies, the levels of environmental chemicals found in Kelp Gulls from Chile are much lower than those known to cause adverse effects on reproductive success.																			0214-8358					DEC	1999	63			1			495	502		10.3989/scimar.1999.63s1495	http://dx.doi.org/10.3989/scimar.1999.63s1495													WOS:000085828800057
J	Steitz, A; Velimirov, B				Steitz, A; Velimirov, B			Contribution of Picocyanobacteria to total primary production and community respiratory losses in a backwater system	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The contribution of autotrophic picoplankton (APP) to phytoplanktonic primary production, investigated during the phytoplankton growing season (March-September) in a macrophyte-dominated backwater system near Vienna, showed that APP mainly consisted of rod-shaped and coccoid cyanobacteria. Two stations were examined, exhibiting similar seasonal patterns in the development of picocyanobacteria, although the two sites differed in picocyanobacterial cell numbers and biomass by a factor of 1.5. Cell numbers determined by epifluorescence microscopy varied between 0.29 x 10(4) and 34.5 x 10(4) cells ml(-1) at Station 1, and between 0.23 x 10(4) and 19.1 x 10(4) cells ml(-1) at Station 2. At both sites, the mean cell volume of picocyanobacteria was 0.5 mu m(3). Carbon fixation in the planktonic community of the Kuhworter Wasser was dominated primarily by larger phytoplankton, although the picoplankton community sometimes supplied up to 74% (mean: 35%) of total primary production. Distinct differences in chlorophyll a concentrations and primary production between the two sites refer to a greater competition between phytoplankton and macrophytes at Station 2. Community respiration deviated greatly in time and in level at the two stations, showing a higher dynamic in community metabolism at Station 1. At this site, community respiration losses ranged between 12 and 100% of gross production. Hence, community metabolism comprised net autotrophic, balanced, and net heterotrophic situations over the investigation period, whereas at Station 2, only net autotrophic situations could be determined.																			0142-7873					DEC	1999	21	12					2341	2360		10.1093/plankt/21.12.2341	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/21.12.2341													WOS:000084287500007

An annual fossil record of production, planktivory and piscivory during whole-lake manipulations	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Annual and subannual paleolimnological records of pigments and zooplankton were used to analyze three whole-lake manipulations. The relative abundance of cladoceran remains in recent seasonal laminae was significantly correlated with the relative abundance of species in the plankton (r(2) = 0.59, P<0.001). Comparison of food-web structure after piscivore introduction showed that there are multiple outcomes of predation and that final food-web structure depended on the strength of interaction between piscivorous and planktivorous fish. Intense predation on cyprinids (Phoxinus eos, P neogaeus, Umbra limi) by largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) allowed large herbivores (Daphnia pulex) and invertebrate predators (Chaoborus punctipennis) to dominate. Analysis of fossil invertebrate morphology suggested that small grazers (Bosmina longirostris, Diaphanosoma birgei) were eliminated by invertebrate predators. Under moderate predation by rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), cyprinids remained, only intermediate-size herbivores (D. rosea) increased in abundance, and Bosmina persisted. In contrast to food-web manipulations, increased algal abundance resulting from watershed disturbance (road construction) did not alter the species composition or size-structure of fossil Cladocera.

The development process and stability classification of glacial lakes is of great significance to the study of seasonal glaciers in the eastern Himalayan margin, with implications for economic development and disaster prevention. Based on Landsat remote sensing image data from 2000 to 2021, this study analyzed the development and change characteristics of glacial lakes in the Niangmuco region during the past 21 years, and classified the stability of lakes with areas >0.02 km(2) using the fuzzy consistent matrix method. In this area, 126 glacial lakes were identified within an elevation range of 3044-4156 m with a total area of 10.94 km(2). These lakes primarily included glacial erosion lakes, valley lakes, tectonic lakes, and landslide dam lakes. Specifically, glacial erosion lakes accounted for 88.9% of the total number of lakes and 60.3% of the total lake area, followed by valley lakes with 6.3% and 23.7%, respectively. From 2000 to 2010, the total area of glacial lakes decreased from 10.53 km(2) to 10.09 km(2), which may be attributable to climate fluctuations. Subsequently, the area of lakes increased significantly to 10.94 km(2) in 2021, an increase of 0.41 km(2). Compared with 2000, among the lakes with a growth rate of 0.019 km(2)/a in 21 years, glacial erosion lakes exhibited the largest change. Among the classified glacial lakes in the study area, 95.7% were stable and relatively stable, mostly comprising glacial erosion lakes at high altitudes between 3468 and 4156 m. Only 4 unstable and extremely unstable glacial lakes were identified, and they were located near a fault zone. The findings show that the development and the change of glacial lakes in the area are primarily controlled by temperature and precipitation, and the topography and fault activity have important influences on the stability of glacial lakes.																				2296-6463				FEB 16	2024	12								1361889	10.3389/feart.2024.1361889	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2024.1361889													WOS:001174614400001

J	López, C; de Roa, EZ				López, C; de Roa, EZ			Day-night vertical distribution and feeding patterns of fourth instar of Chaoborus larvae in a neotropical reservoir (Socuy Reservoir, Venezuela)	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												The day-night vertical distribution, diel feeding activity and diet of fourth instar of Chaoborus larvae were analyzed in lacustrine zone of a neotropical reservoir which shows seasonally contrasting hypolimnetic oxygen conditions. Larvae stayed in sediment and water bottom during day and ascended to surface during night. Results indicate that feeding activity is limited mainly to the plankton population. Phytoplankton, rotifers or remains of Chaoborus larvae were not found in crops. With the exception of ostracods, all crustacean prey available in the zooplankton occurred in the guts. Ceriodaphnia cornuta and Moina micrura were the most frequent food items (about 75% of occurrence frequency) and were positively selected. The remainder crustacean zooplankton taxa were negatively selected by larvae. The most intense feeding activity in larvae occurred near midnight and sunrise, in dates when the hypolimnion was anoxic. When oxygen was available on the bottom, a higher and not changing diel feeding activity was detected. Our results indicate that vertical migration may promote a spatial separation between larvae and zooplankton, and feeding activity of larvae occurred only when both overlapped.

In a warm eutrophic monomictic lake of the region we analyzed changes in the phytoplankton community and how they relate to water quality. During the periods of circulation, early and late stratification, there was an increase in species diversity marked by an increase in the abundance of many species of diatoms and chlorophytes. These periods were characterized by low transparency, high specific conductance, and high concentrations of ammonium and dissolved silica. Microcystis aeruginosa dominated during the entire stratification period, when both diversity and succession rates were low. Stratification was characterized by high temperatures ( > 30 degrees C), low transparency, high pH, and high concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus and nitrate. Thus, in Lake Chalchoapan, physical changes associated with stratification, circulation, and tropical seasonality determine the succession dynamics of the phytoplankton community.

J	PAERL, HW; JOYE, SB; FITZPATRICK, M				PAERL, HW; JOYE, SB; FITZPATRICK, M			EVALUATION OF NUTRIENT LIMITATION OF CO2 AND N2 FIXATION IN MARINE MICROBIAL MATS	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Photosynthetic CO2 fixation and N2 fixation are fundamentally important in mediating production dynamics of intertidal and subtidal marine microbial mat communities. We examined nutrient [N, P, Fe, Mo, dissolved organic carbon (DOC)] limitaton of CO2 and N2 fixation in geographically and physiologically diverse mats. Nitrogen enrichment (as NO3 infrequently stimulated CO2 fixation. Phosphorus, Fe and Mo enrichment generally failed to stimulate CO2 fixation. The frequent absence of N limitation appears linked to the ability of mat microbial communities to fix N2 and effectively recycle fixed N. Nitrogen fixation was enhanced by DOC, while no P, Fe or trace element stimulation was observed. The lack of nutrient stimulation of CO2 fixation appeared related to low net growth rates of some mats. Slow growing mats, including hypersaline, stromatolitic (Storrs Lake, Bahamas) and certain hypersaline, lagoonal mats (Guerrero Negro, Baja California, Mexico) exhibited virtually no nutrient stimulation of either CO2 or N2 fixation. More productive coastal (North Carolina, USA) and estuarine (Tomales Bay, California, USA) mats showed higher frequencies of nutrient limitation of either process. Seasonally, N and DOC stimulation were most profound during periods of maximum growth. Mats are able to minimize C and N limitation by metabolically coupling CO2 and N2 fixation as sources of 'new' C and N inputs respectively. Phototrophic-heterotrophic microbial consortia appear to mediate coupling, which minimizes losses of fixed C and N to overlying waters.					; Paerl, Hans/ACA-9911-2022	Joye, Samantha/0000-0003-1610-451X; 													0171-8630	1616-1599				NOV	1993	101	3					297	306		10.3354/meps101297	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps101297													WOS:A1993MH49900009

The current work involves the seasonal distribution of foraminifera in the outer channel sector of the Chilika Lagoon, Odisha during 2017-2018. The outer channel is marine as the sea mouth is nearby. Altogether 28 species of benthic foraminifera are identified, among which dominant are Ammonia spp. The other calcareous taxa are Elphidium spp, Quinqueloculina sp., Haynesina spp., Pararotalia sp., Hanzawaia sp., Nonionellina sp. and agglutinated forms such as Miliammina sp., Trochammina sp. and Textularina sp. are found in moderate abundance. Based on the pre-monsoon abundance, the cluster analyses show two distinct biofacies zones in the studied area. Total foraminiferal number (TFN) increases during pre-monsoon compared to post-monsoon months. A trend of decreasing abundance was observed in TFN, mainly calcareous taxa towards the inner part of the lagoon, that is, away from the sea mouth.

Habitat type and environmental factors	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												This study examined the spatial distribution of wetland insects in relation to selected environmental variables in northeastern Venezuela. Sampling was carried out over two sampling periods (rainy and dry season) in seven wetland types (brackish and freshwater herbaceous swamps, mangrove swamps, freshwater ponds, clear-cut marsh forests, small irrigation canals, and swamp forests), covering three environmental gradients (salinity, aquatic vegetation type, and habitat permanence). Using the partial redundancy analysis, we determined that occurrence and abundance of insects was significantly (P<0.05) accounted for by the relative contributions of pure environmental (29-34%) and habitat type-related (12-15%) variations among wetlands. Water chemistry (salinity), wetland trophic state (phytoplankton), habitat heterogeneity (aquatic vegetation type), and habitat physical features (depth and habitat permanence) were significantly associated to community structure. Insect richness was higher in the less saline, more vegetated, and less temporary wetlands. Our findings add to previous results suggesting that adversity, productivity, heterogeneity and permanence of the habitat represent important axes along which Neotropical wetland insect communities are organized.

The mats are usually created by single species. In order to achieve seasonal domination, the algae secrete to the environment the allelopathic substances, which are phenolic compounds. In the period of intensive population growth, the thread-like thalli of these algae are richly incrusted with epiphytic diatoms. The amount of the secreted phenolic compounds changes in time within the vegetation period and depends on the weather conditions. The most abundant secretion of phenolic compounds takes place in July when, with increasing concentration of phenolic compounds in water, their content in the cells decreases. The main aim of the study was to establish the effect of the phenolic compounds secreted by C. glomerata thalli on the diatoms growing on them. According to our results, polyphenolic compounds have an impact not only on the abundance of diatom communities, but also on the structure of their communities. With increasing concentration of polyphenols, the abundance of Achnathidium minutissimum, Gomphonema olivaceum, Cocconeis pediculus, Navicula tripunctata decreased, while that of Amphora ovalis, Navicula rostellata, Staurosira construens, Cymbella lange-bartelotti increased. The species Cocconeis placentula reached domination thanks to the favorable influence of the environment and the effect of polyphenols secreted by the macroalgae. The variation in the diatom communities' structure was proved to also depend on the habitat parameters, mainly: EC, Turbidity, NNH4, N-NO3, TDS.					; Pankiewicz, Radosław/D-5223-2013; Tabisz, Łukasz/AAW-3738-2020	Leska, Boguslawa/0000-0002-9504-5265; Pankiewicz, Radoslaw/0000-0002-0929-6018; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				FEB	2024	159								111703	10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.111703	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.111703		FEB 2024											WOS:001185402300001

Translocation of prespawn adult Kootenai River white sturgeon	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY					6th International Symposium on Sturgeons	OCT 25-30, 2009	Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA					During 2003 and 2004, 25 mature Kootenai River white sturgeon Acipenser transmontanus were dual tagged with sonic and radio transmitters, and translocated upstream approximately 50 km from their current spawning site which is comprised of silt and sand and with low egg survival. The release site was higher gradient and cobble and gravel substrate (canyon reach). The purpose of this study was to join mature white sturgeon with a more suitable incubation and rearing habitat and determine if translocation had legitimacy as a management measure. Residence times in the study varied among years and release groups and movement patterns were difficult to discern. In 2003, all males moved downstream out of the canyon reach within 2 days of release. Of the three females released in 2003, one remained in the canyon reach for 13 days while the other two moved downstream within 4 days. However, five eggs were collected on one substrate mat in the canyon reach in 2003 near river kilometer 261.6, although the eggs were too early in their developmental stage to verify fertilization. In 2004, adults were released in two different time frames, an early and late period. Only one female was part of the early release group in 2004, but three of the remaining six males from this group stayed in the canyon reach for over 3 weeks, the longest of any group. Combining years, males stayed in the canyon reach longer than females; white sturgeon released early in the spawning season stayed in the canyon reach longer. The release of white sturgeon in groups or in areas where other white sturgeon were residing may increase the residency in the study reach. It is feasible to move mature white sturgeon into the more suitable spawning habitats, however, the population level benefits are difficult to determine from this research, and should be weighed against other management and recovery actions.																			0175-8659	1439-0426				APR	2011	27	2					450	453		10.1111/j.1439-0426.2010.01488.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0426.2010.01488.x													WOS:000288864600046

A study was conducted to reveal the effects of wave exposure on four helophyte species, Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steudel, Typha angustifolia L., Scirpus lacustris L. and Scripus maritimus L. in the northern Delta area in the Netherlands. The species differed with respect to the wave exposure of their locations. Typha angustifolia was restricted to sheltered sites, whereas the other species were present on sheltered and moderately exposed shores. In a gradient from sheltered to exposed sites, wave exposure appeared to be related to soil texture and organic matter content. In a cultivation experiment with the four species on transplanted soil originating from three sites (exposed, intermediate and sheltered), only the growth of T. angustifolia was affected by the soil types. At the sites, transplanted rhizomes of the helophyte species studied did not survive the wave attack in the growing season at the exposed site, while at the completely sheltered site these plants produced the highest biomass. Wave attack on the sites within the growing season was determined by means of the wave-forecasting model HISWA (Hindcast Shallow Water Waves). Maximal wave heights and orbital velocities were concluded to be key factors in the decreased growth rates of plants at exposed sites.																			0304-3770					SEP	1991	41	4					333	352		10.1016/0304-3770(91)90052-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(91)90052-7													WOS:A1991GF86200006

In this article we introduce a rich time series dataset of ships entering the city's port and the commodities they carried, explore its potential for urban metabolism research, and consider some of its limitations. We argue that the detail recorded in the ledgers of the Toronto Harbour Master affords multiple temporal and geospatial scales of analysis to study the city's urban metabolism (e.g. seasonality and consignees of specific commodities), which means historians can use these quantitative sources to move beyond simplistic input-output evaluations and consider the nuance and complexity that characterized the role of the port in the city's social, economic, and environmental history. We demonstrate that the port was vital to the process of assembling the city even as the railways became dominant in Ontario during the second half of the nineteenth century. As the city grew, the data reveal that the port remained an important node within a broader Great Lakes socioecological system at the same time as it served the city's downtown and discrete subsystems of its urban metabolism.

However, the species has experienced severe declines due to overexploitation. In South Florida, loss of nesting habitat, with coastal degradation from sea level rise and urban development has prompted American crocodiles to nest in novel habitats. Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge (CLNWR) serves as an important nesting site for the South Florida population of American crocodiles and more recently nesting habitat has been supplemented to manage coastal erosion. The goal of this study was to investigate the internal nest biology of American crocodile nests laid in sediment nourished sand mounds on CLNWR. We monitored internal nest temperature and volumetric water content of five live and two control sand nests in 2021 (N = 73 eggs) and 2022 (N = 84 eggs). The metabolic heat generated by incubating eggs in internal nest temperatures ranged from 0.8 degrees C to 2.0 degrees C warmer and more stable than ambient temperatures and reflecting a seasonal pattern. Average clutch size was 31.4 +/- 7.09 eggs and incubation period ranged from 78 to 114 days until hatching. These data provide the first insight into thermal regimes of nests laid in novel/supplemented nesting habitat as is the case for a significant proportion of nests in the South Florida population of American crocodiles. Here we provide an opportunity to evaluate the importance of creating artificial nesting habitat for American crocodiles where habitat degradation from climate change threatens species survival.

Assessing long-term diatom changes in sub-Arctic ponds receiving high fluxes of seabird nutrients	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Algal bioindicators, such as diatoms, often show subdued responses to eutrophication in Arctic lakes because climate-related changes (e.g., ice cover) tend to be the overriding factors influencing assemblage composition. Here, we examined how sub-Arctic ponds historically receiving high nutrient inputs from nesting seabirds have responded to recent climate change. We present diatom data obtained from 12 sediment cores in seaduck-affected ponds located on islands through Hudson Strait, Canada. All study cores show consistently elevated values of sedimentary delta N-5, an established proxy for tracking marine-derived nutrients, indicating seabirds have been present on these islands for at least the duration of the sediment records (similar to 100 to 400 years). We document diverse epiphytic diatom assemblages to the base of all sediment cores, which is in marked contrast to seabird-free Arctic ponds-these oligotrophic sites typically record epilithic diatom flora prior to recent warming. Diatoms are likely responding indirectly to seabird nutrients via habitat as nutrients promote the growth of mosses supporting epiphytic diatom communities. This masks the typical diatom response to increased warming in the Arctic, which also results in habitat changes and the growth of mosses around the pond edges. Changes in sedimentary chlorophyll a were not consistently synchronous with large changes in delta N-15 values, suggesting that primary production in ponds is not responding linearly to changes in seabird-derived nitrogen. Across all ponds, we recorded shifts in diatom epiphytic assemblages (e.g., increases in % relative abundance of many Nitzschia species) that often align with increases in chlorophyll a. The changes in diatoms and chlorophyll a, although variable, are most likely driven by climate change as they are generally consistent with longer ice-free conditions and growing seasons. Together, our results show that to effectively use diatoms in animal population reconstructions across the sub-Arctic and Arctic, a strong understanding of eutrophication and climate change, based on supplementary proxies, is also required.					; Blais, Jules/AAV-2321-2020; Duda, Matthew/ABF-2571-2020; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Hargan, Kathryn/0000-0002-2232-3711; Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; Duda, Matthew/0000-0002-9193-4137; Michelutti, Neal/0000-0002-5857-4811													2045-7758					FEB	2024	14	2							e11034	10.1002/ece3.11034	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.11034								38371864					WOS:001163398500001

Studies evidencing the negative effects of agricultural practices on wader populations are numerous, but even in most specially managed areas the decline cannot be reversed. Earlier studies have shown that predation of nests and chicks occurs frequent, and that current predator densities can add to the decline and/or prevent recovery. In this study we experimentally study the effect of different intensities of predator control of Red Fox Vulpus vulpes, Beech Marten Martes foina, Badger Meles meles, Pine Marten Martes lotor and Raccoon Dog Nyctereutes procyonoides on nest predation and chick survival of the Black-tailed Godwit Limosa l. limosa at lake Dimmer, Lower Saxony, Germany. The area was subdivided in two subareas (Ochsenmoor and Osterfeiner Moor), between 2009-2017 343 nests were monitored. Normal predator control was implemented in both subareas in 2009 and 2010; during these years nest survival was low. From 2011 until 2017 intensified year-round predator control was implemented in Ochsenmoor and from 2016 also in Osterfeiner Moor. From 2011 until 2015 nest survival was relatively higher in the subarea with intensified predator control (Ochsenmoor). In 2016 and 2017 pre dators were intensively controlled in both subareas and nest survival was similarly high in both. From 2009 until 2017 chick survival was measured using radiotelemetry on 243 chicks. Generally, we found that in the subarea with intensified predator control, chick survival was higher. Combining the estimates of nest and chick survival, we estimate that godwit pairs raised between 0.97-1.12 fledglings per season under an intensive predator control regime and only 0.09-0.18 fledglings when predators were hunted at a normal level. As godwit pairs need to produce around 0.6 fledglings per year to sustain their population, the intensified predator control in this study-area has contributed to the recent increase in the breeding population. Our results thus show that the impact of mammalian predators on the breeding productivity of godwits can be reduced by intensified predator control. The intensified control of the targeted ground predators in this subarea could have resulted in increasing densities of unhunted predators, which subsequently could reduce nest or chick survival. Within the timespan of this experimental study, we did not observe a decrease in nest/chick survival that could hint at this meso-predator release.																			0373-2266	2213-1175				FEB	2024	112	1					103	112		10.5253/arde.2023.a16	http://dx.doi.org/10.5253/arde.2023.a16													WOS:001368790000001

Therefore, monitoring shifts in plankton composition can indicate changes in water quality and aid to identify potential pollution sources. In the present study, the variation in plankton dynamics in relation to ecological variables were monitored in the freshwater zone of the Hooghly estuary from May 2020 to April 2021. The study was conducted in the interval of every six hours. i.e., at 6 A.M., 12 P.M., 6 P.M., and 12 A.M. The present finding revealed the occurrence of 54 phytoplankton and 20 zooplankton taxa/species. Diel variation revealed that among different time intervals, the highest abundance of phytoplankton was recorded 28,307 cells l(-1) at 12 P.M, while the lowest was recorded 10,632 cells l-1 at 6 A.M. However, the highest zooplankton abundance was observed 804 ind l(-1) at 6 A.M., and the lowest was recorded 156 ind l(-1) at 6 P.M. The ANOVA (p < 0.05) analysis indicated significant diel variation for many planktonic genera. The CCA exhibited that most of the phytoplankton were influenced by multiple water quality variables such as temperature, turbidity, calcium, pH, salinity, DO, and nutrients. However, the majority of the zooplankton were affected by turbidity, total phosphorus, sulphate, calcium and available nitrogen. Significant seasonal variation in plankton composition has also been observed. The present study will help to determine the varying diel pattern of planktons in retort to alterations in the water quality parameters and varying ecological niches.

AGRO-PHYSIOLOGICAL AND GENETIC CHARACTERIZATION OF HALOPHYTE SPECIES AND THEIR IMPACT ON SALT-AFFECTED SOIL	SABRAO JOURNAL OF BREEDING AND GENETICS												The adverse effects of climate change and heightened soil salinity on agricultural production are definite. Halophytes serve to remove salts from soil effectively and economically. Consequently, the presented work has evaluated the impact of three halophytic species on salt-affected soil. The study used inter simple sequence repeats (ISSRs) and start codon targeted (SCoT) markers to examine the genetic variations. Field experiments progressed on salt-affected soils around Qarun Lake's coastal region for two consecutive seasons (2019 and 2020). The soil and plants underwent analysis using established methodologies. The findings indicated that after the fifth cutting for the three halophytic species, there was a drop in salinity indices, implying an improvement in soil quality assessments. On the other hand, six ISSR and 10 SCoT primers amplified 96 and 190 bands with 84.14% and 88.29% polymorphism, respectively. Additionally, they demonstrated numerous positive and negative markers linked to some phenotypic traits. Polymorphic information content (PIC) values were 0.51 (ISSRs) and 0.48 (SCoT), indicating that these markers were moderately informative. Heterozygosity index (He) values were 0.59 (ISSRs) and 0.57 (SCoT), implying a substantial degree of genetic diversity present within the studied species.					; Samaha, Ghada/ABC-6342-2021	samaha, ghada/0000-0003-2937-755X; 													1029-7073	2224-8978				FEB	2024	56	1					76	88		10.54910/sabrao2024.56.1.7	http://dx.doi.org/10.54910/sabrao2024.56.1.7													WOS:001185670200020

Reproduction was monitored by histological examination of gonads, analysis of shell length-dry weight relationships, and following abundance of planktonic and settling larvae. Patterns of planktonic larval abundance and settling showed a distinct bimodal pattern in July and August, but conflicted with histological and length-dry weight data that showed spawning was a brief, highly synchronous event occurring in late August. Differences between histological data and abundance of larvae in the plankton can be explained as resulting from drift of larvae from disjunct populations of D. polymorpha which spawned earlier, into the study area. Veliger larvae were present in the plankton at low densities throughout the warm months before and after periods of peak abundances. The presence of these larvae can be explained by a combination of asynchronous spawning among local populations and postponed settlement by planktonic larvae.																			0018-8158					MAY 29	1992	234	2					103	110		10.1007/BF00010865	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00010865													WOS:A1992JE14600004
J	BUSH, MB; COLINVAUX, PA				BUSH, MB; COLINVAUX, PA			A 7000-YEAR POLLEN RECORD FROM THE AMAZON LOWLANDS, ECUADOR	VEGETATIO												The longest continuous Amazonian palynological record (ca 7010 yrs B.P. to present) from Lake Ayauchi, Ecuador, reveals species-by-species abundance changes during a period of climatic change. Pollen influx from a wet tropical rain forest was found to be high, 1 .times. 104-105 grains cm-2 yr-1, although mature forest taxa were poorly represented. Horizons of laminated sediments and weathered gyttja, dated to ca 4200-3150 B.P., evidence a period of reduced net water availability. During this period Ficus, Alchornea and Palmae pollen representation appears to decline, although there is no evidence of a major forest compositional change. The lake was reduced to a shallow, possibly seasonal, pool. Zea cultivation was recorded between ca 2850 B.P., (the earliest paleoecological record to date in the Amazon basin) and ca 800 B.P. It is suggested that Zea was cultivated on exposed lake sediment within the crater at times of low water levels. The abandonment of Zea cultivation may have been due to rising water levels or social unrest.

Correlations of trace element concentrations with the various main components of the setrling particles (biological material, calcium carbonate, manganese and iron oxides, silicate minerals) and examination of seasonal variations both of these concentrations in particles and of particle fluxes to the sediments show that biological material is an important carrier phase (especialliy for Cu and Zn). Iron and manganese oxides also contribute to trace element transport; calcium carbonate is inefficient as a carrier material.

Non-pollen palynomorph assemblages in mid- to late Holocene wetland deposits and their palaeoenvironments of deposition: Microfossil signatures in sediment sequences of the Yangtze Delta coastal lowlands, East China	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Fluvial processes such as sediment deposition within drainage channels and seasonal overbank flooding, and fluvial events such as occasional high intensity floods all leave particular sedimentary signatures in terms of their lithology and also in their contained microfossil assemblages, which represent different environments of deposition. Over several thousand years the Yangtze River in eastern China has developed a coastal lowland plain around its delta that is mainly composed of stacked fluvial sediment facies, but also includes many marine or estuarine layers in some areas, as well as deposits of limnic and semi-terrestrial pool, marsh and mire origin, some of which are highly organic. The fluvial facies are dominantly clastic sequences of sands, silts and clays that reflect a range of deposition from quiet water to high energy conditions and in varying water depths, mainly governed by fluvial input from the Yangtze and the many other, smaller, rivers and streams of the deltaic lowland. The limnic and marshland sediments reflect autochthonous deposition in a range of freshwater wetland types of varying water depth, from lake through marsh/fen to surface peatland. Allied to lithological and pollen data, non-pollen palynomorph spore assemblages and abundances within these complex sedimentary sequences, particularly from algal communities, provide signatures of floodplain wetland depositional history and hydrodynamic patterns. We have used groupings of these microfossil data to characterise the sedimentary facies of the lower Yangtze coastal plain and to reconstruct hydrological history across the area at a range of spatial scales. Fluctuations in the relative taxa abundances are good indicators of changes in water levels at the site scale from surface waterlogging through reedswamp and fen to deeper open water. While some changes seem to be site specific, the data show flooding and increased water depths that correlate with known phases of climatic deterioration.

Dominant nitrogen metabolisms of a warm, seasonally anoxic freshwater ecosystem revealed using genome resolved metatranscriptomics	MSYSTEMS												Nitrogen (N) availability is one of the principal drivers of primary productivity across aquatic ecosystems. However, the microbial communities and emergent metabolisms that govern N cycling in tropical lakes are both distinct from and poorly understood relative to those found in temperate lakes. This latitudinal difference is largely due to the warm (>20 degrees C) temperatures of tropical lake anoxic hypolimnions (deepest portion of a stratified water column), which result in unique anaerobic metabolisms operating without the temperature constraints found in lakes at temperate latitudes. As such, tropical hypolimnions provide a platform for exploring microbial membership and functional diversity. To better understand N metabolism in warm anoxic waters, we combined measurements of geochemistry and water column thermophysical structure with genome-resolved metatranscriptomic analyses of the water column microbiome in Lake Yojoa, Honduras. We sampled above and below the oxycline in June 2021, when the water column was stratified, and again at the same depths and locations in January 2022, when the water column was mixed. We identified 335 different lineages and significantly different microbiome membership between seasons and, when stratified, between depths. Notably, nrfA (indicative of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium) was upregulated relative to other N metabolism genes in the June hypolimnion. This work highlights the taxonomic and functional diversity of microbial communities in warm and anoxic inland waters, providing insight into the contemporary microbial ecology of tropical ecosystems as well as inland waters at higher latitudes as water columns continue to warm in the face of global change. IMPORTANCE In aquatic ecosystems where primary productivity is limited by nitrogen (N), whether continuously, seasonally, or in concert with additional nutrient limitations, increased inorganic N availability can reshape ecosystem structure and function, potentially resulting in eutrophication and even harmful algal blooms. Whereas microbial metabolic processes such as mineralization and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium increase inorganic N availability, denitrification removes bioavailable N from the ecosystem. Therefore, understanding these key microbial mechanisms is critical to the sustainable management and environmental stewardship of inland freshwater resources. This study identifies and characterizes these crucial metabolisms in a warm, seasonally anoxic ecosystem. Results are contextualized by an ecological understanding of the study system derived from a multi-year continuous monitoring effort. This unique data set is the first of its kind in this largely understudied ecosystem (tropical lakes) and also provides insight into microbiome function and associated taxa in warm, anoxic freshwaters.

Management of curlyleaf pondweed with herbicides is common with long-term control and protection of desirable native vegetation being important goals. The herbicide diquat was applied to Crystal Lake (Middletown, CT) in 2007, 2009, and 2010 to control curlyleaf pondweed prior to turion production. No herbicides were applied in 2006, 2008, or 2011. Two other invasive macrophytes, Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L.) and brittleleaf naiad (Najas minor All.), were also present along with 14 species of native macrophytes. Aquatic vegetation surveys were performed to assess the efficacy of the single (1-yr) and consecutive (2-yr) diquat treatments on the invasive and native plant assemblages. The frequency of occurrence and abundance of curlyleaf pondweed were reduced to negligible levels in the treatment years. In the untreated year after a single treatment (2008), curlyleaf pondweed frequency was reduced slightly but the abundance was greater than in the year prior to treatment (2006). In the untreated year following two consecutive early-season diquat treatments (2011), the frequency of curlyleaf pondweed decreased by 30% and the abundance declined by 55% compared to the year prior to treatment (2006). After the first of the two consecutive years of diquat treatments (2009), Eurasian watermilfoil was eliminated. Both the frequency and abundance of brittleleaf naiad increased in the untreated years of 2008 and 2011. The response of native macrophytes to the diquat treatments was species-specific but overall native species richness was greater in years following the single and consecutive diquat treatments.																			0146-6623					JUL	2015	53						171	177																WOS:000367965000004

The investigation was conducted in Riogrande II reservoir (6 degrees 35' 57 ''-6 degrees 28' 79 '' N, 75 degrees 32' 17 '' W) whose retention time was 72, 8 days. In it were sampled five stations at fortnightly intervals during one year (July 2002 to July 2003) in which data from three climate variables, five physical and 15 chemicals ones were obtained. For this species, its mean growth rate and renovation, mean time of generation, growing type and spatial and temporal arrangement, were calculated. A redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to establish the relation between the biological and environmental variables. Along the time, the algae adjusted to a pattern of three 'peaks' occurred in the season of the lowest rainfall when the nutrients were indeed concentrated, and the light climate was affected. In the five stations the species was grouped and in the space its disposition was at random. The first four axis of the RDA included NO3-, SiO2, pH, SS y %SO2, attenuation vertical light coefficient, chlorophyll a, and different competitors. This species is a C-strategist and, as other Chlorococcales, it is a typical taxon of eutrophic systems, with high growth and change rates, short regeneration time, and contagious distribution pattern in temporal scale, therefore, under a non-equilibrium ecology, more density in the seasons of low rainfall when nutrients were concentrated and light climate was affected. In the space, the species showed a random distribution because of the current regimen of this basin. Besides, it is not limited by resources, it responses with an adaptation to the optimal climate of water system with its circular section, and acicular shape attenuated to both ends that places it as a good light-harvester; thus, it can be included in the J or X1 associations and in the Morpho-Functional-Group IV.																			0366-5232	2357-3759				JUL-DEC	2015	37	2					359	379		10.15446/caldasia.v37n2.53558	http://dx.doi.org/10.15446/caldasia.v37n2.53558													WOS:000368430800010

Mean intensities of up to 16.2 larvae and 2.1 nymphs were found on Peromyscus leucopus (Rafinesque), with an overall prevalence of infestation up to 92%. Adult I. dammini (101.6 +/- 77.63) (mean +/- SD) were found on 8 white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmerman). The seasonal pattern of recovery of ticks from hosts and the environment resembled that described elsewhere. I. dammini was not found on 952 small mammals trapped at 25 other localities throughout Ontario, although other ticks (Dermacentor variabilis (Packard), Ixodes angustus Neumann, I. marxi Banks, I. muris Bishopp & Smith) were encountered sporadically. I. dammini is not widespread or common in Ontario other than at Long Point. Borrelia burgdorferi was isolated from 10 of 151 P. leucopus; from larval and nymphal I. dammini; and from nymphal and adult D. variabilis, all from Long Point. B. burgdorferi was not recovered from 116 small mammals from localities other than Long Point. Seropositive P. leucopus (indirect fluorescent antibody test titer greater-than-or-equal-to 1:20) were common (up to 30% prevalence in July 1988, n = 23) on Long Point. Where I. dammini was not found, the prevalence of seroreactors among Peromyscus was 0 (15 sites), <12% (5 sites), and 29% (I site); seroprevalence at 1:20 could not be calculated for a further 4 sites examined in 1987.

Assessment of the floodplain fishery of Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Across the globe, fish stocks have been in decline due to industrialization of fisheries resources, overfishing, pollution, and climate change, thereby warranting more fisheries assessments. The floodplain fishery of Tonle Sap Lake near the Kampong Khleang stilted community in the Chamkar Youn village in Cambodia was evaluated by: (1) characterizing fish assemblage structure and function, (2) highlighting temporal differences in fish assemblage, and (3) assessing potential indicators of fishing-down-the-food-web by the fishery. Fish trap data from the wet season were used to characterize fish abundance, diversity, species richness, and functional feeding guilds from fish catches in 2014 and 2019. Fish abundance declined 62% and species richness declined between 2014 and 2019. Smaller-bodied, lower-trophic level fishes dominated the catch. Our limited findings add insight into the status of a globally important fishery and highlight the need for more local collaborative fishery assessments.

The influence of landscape composition and configuration on breeding waterfowl pair abundance in Wisconsin	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												Habitat loss and fragmentation have negatively impacted breeding birds across the world. Across guilds, grassland-dependent birds have experienced the largest proportional loss of their breeding population while wetland-dependent birds have realized overall net gains in part due to focused conservation efforts. However, some species within the wetland-dependent guild have a strong dependence on non-wetland land cover types during the annual cycle and therefore may be equally sensitive to reductions in the composition and altered configuration of upland landcover, such as grasslands. We explored the influence of landcover composition and configuration on the number of breeding pairs of a breeding habitat generalist, the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), and a grassland-dependent breeding species, the blue-winged teal (Spatula discors), in agriculturally-intensive landscapes of Wisconsin, USA. Because of the extensive landscape alteration and habitat fragmentation that has occurred, we expected mallards to have a more utilitarian response to varying landscape composition compared to a grassland nesting obligate like blue-winged teal. We used helicopter surveys conducted across 8 years (2001-2003, 2006-2009, and 2012) and remotely-sensed land cover data to investigate the influence of habitat associations on relative abundance of breeding pairs. Model selection indicated that landscape composition models outperformed landscape configuration and null models for both species. Consistent with our predictions, we found that mallard pair counts were positively influenced by a greater number of land cover covariates compared to blue-winged teal. Both blue-winged teal and mallard breeding pairs were positively related to increased composition of emergent and scrub-shrub wetlands as well as upland grassland. Additionally, we found that mallard pairs were positively related to forested, cattail (Typha sp.), and open water wetland types, whereas predicted blue-winged teal pair abundance was negatively related to forested wetlands and had a nonlinear relationship and declined when surveyed land sections were comprised of more than 30% cattail-dominated wetlands and 20% open-water wetlands. Increased quantities of cattail-dominated and open-water wetland cover types comparatively provide less habitat for blue-winged teal and may reflect broader shifts in habitat composition that have likely resulted from agricultural intensification and stabilized hydrology.

J	PRIETO, FJG				PRIETO, FJG			SHORELINE FORMS AND DEPOSITS IN GALLOCANTA LAKE (NE SPAIN)	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The Quaternary evolution of Gallocanta Lake (central Iberian Chain, Spain) is deduced from comparison between ancient deposits and present shoreline sedimentary forms. Present shoreline dynamics in the lake are controlled by persistent winds, parallel to the long-axis of the lake, creating wave fronts at the shore and net longshore currents. Present lake level fluctuations lead to a shoreline progradation during periods of lowering and to a partial erosion of ancient deposits during periods of rising level. Quaternary deposits in the region are represented by stepped lacustrine terraces which reflect a greater extension of the lake in the past. The sedimentological analysis of such deposits shows that their origin is linked to past lake-level fluctuations. Short-term (e.g. seasonal to multi-annual) fluctuations would have led to the building of a single terrace level by shoreline progradation processes. Long-term fluctuations, related to regional climatic changes, would have led to the present landscape of stepped terraces, reflecting a progressive aridification of the area.

Phytoplankton ecology in the early years of a boreal oil sands end pit lake	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOME												BackgroundBase Mine Lake (BML) is the first full-scale end pit lake for the oil sands mining industry in Canada. BML sequesters oil sands tailings under a freshwater cap and is intended to develop into a functional ecosystem that can be integrated into the local watershed. The first stage of successful reclamation requires the development of a phytoplankton community supporting a typical boreal lake food web. To assess the diversity and dynamics of the phytoplankton community in BML at this reclamation stage and to set a baseline for future monitoring, we examined the phytoplankton community in BML from 2016 through 2021 using molecular methods (targeting the 23S, 18S, and 16S rRNA genes) and microscopic methods. Nearby water bodies were used as controls for a freshwater environment and an active tailings pond.ResultsThe phytoplankton community was made up of diverse bacteria and eukaryotes typical of a boreal lake. Microscopy and molecular data both identified a phytoplankton community comparable at the phylum level to that of natural boreal lakes, dominated by Chlorophyta, Cryptophyta, and Cyanophyta, with some Bacillariophyta, Ochrophyta, and Euglenophyta. Although many of the same genera were prominent in both BML and the control freshwater reservoir, there were differences at the species or ASV level. Total diversity in BML was also consistently lower than the control freshwater site, but consistently higher than the control tailings pond. The phytoplankton community composition in BML changed over the 5-year study period. Some taxa present in 2016-2019 (e.g., Choricystis) were no longer detected in 2021, while some dinophytes and haptophytes became detectable in small quantities starting in 2019-2021. Different quantification methods (qPCR analysis of 23S rRNA genes, and microscopic estimates of populations and total biomass) did not show a consistent directional trend in total phytoplankton over the 5-year study, nor was there any consistent increase in phytoplankton species diversity. The 5-year period was likely an insufficient time frame for detecting community trends, as phytoplankton communities are highly variable at the genus and species level.ConclusionsBML supports a phytoplankton community composition somewhat unique from control sites (active tailings and freshwater lake) and is still changing over time. However, the most abundant genera are typical of natural boreal lakes and have the potential to support a complex aquatic food web, with many of its identified major phytoplankton constituents known to be primary producers in boreal lake environments.

The vascular flora and physico-chemical characteristics of the lagoon were studied in December 1997 (end of the wet season) and May 1998 (dry season). The lagoon water is soft, with acid pH, low conductivity and low transparency. The maximum depth is 2.25 m in the rainy season and 1.20 m in the dry season. A total of 46 vascular plant species were recorded, 32 being emergent macrophytes, mostly Gramineae and Cyperaceae, five floating-leaved, three submerged, one surface-floating and also five shrubs. Cluster analysis of the floristic data shows two main groups of inventories in both seasons, grouping almost nine-tenths of the vegetation samples. The inventories in these groups correspond to two main vegetation types and can be spatially arranged. In the deepest inner part of the lagoon, Nymphaea lotus is the most important species, while Oryza longistaminata dominates in the shallower part. In spite of the shallow depth, the middle of the lagoon remains uncolonized by macrophytes. The main factors limiting the colonization by plants of the lagoon seem to be the low mineral and nutrient content of the water and its low transparency.

Generally, the concentration of major elements (N, P, S, Ca, K, Mg, Cl, Fe, Si, and Al) and trace elements (Ag, As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ga, Hg, I, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Rb, Sr, Ti, Y, and Zn) in the lake sediment reflected the natural regional background. The sediment was characterised by low amounts of organic matter (LOI ca. 5%). MANOVA indicated that the concentrations of 60% of the elements differed significantly between transects and 32% with respect to depths, whereas the seasonal differentiations were not found. The relationships between the studied elements calculated using factor analysis and correlation matrix are discussed. The bottom sediment show considerable heterogeneity, which is probably connected to their allochthonous origins and the young age of the lake.					; Wrobel, Andrzej/T-6570-2019	Wrobel, Andrzej/0000-0003-2785-7058; Ollik, Marcin/0000-0001-8861-803X; 													1386-2588	1573-5125				JUN	2006	40	2					155	164		10.1007/s10452-004-1914-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-004-1914-z													WOS:000240830000003

The most polluted areas were Fuente del Fresno (Jarama River), where the levels of dissolved heavy metals were 10 mu g/L of cadmium and 1 140 mu g/L of lead acid, Torrejon de Ardoz (Henares River) where there was 15 mu g cadmium and 1 140 mu g/L of lead. These two areas showed the greatest amount of industrial effluents, and the protozoan response expressed itself by the presence of resistant species such Euglena gracilis; density and biomass were not affected, although there were changes in the trophic structure, with a predominance of bacterivore and nonselective protozoans. The effects of the heavy metals were masked by the organic pollution. In the stations in well-oxygenated waters, there was a predominance of photoautotrophs and diatoms. In all zones a significant correlation between the density of bacteria and protozoans was observed. The trophic structure of the protozoan communities in the different water courses was influenced by the amount of food available and by organic pollution.

The bacterial assimilation of PDOC was estimated with the C-14 method, and the total production of the heterotrophic bacteria was estimated with the [H-3]thymidine incorporation method. The release of PDOC from natural communities of phytoplankton was not restricted to periods of photosynthesis, but often continued during periods of darkness. Heterotrophic bacteria often assimilated the labile components of the PDOC at high rates (up to 73% of the released PDOC was assimilated during the incubation in our experiments). The contribution of PDOC to bacterial production exhibited large within-lake seasonal variations, but PDOC was at certain times, both in humic and non-humic lakes, a quantitatively very important carbon source for the heterotrophic bacteria. Under periods of comparatively low primary production, heterotrophic bacteria in humic lakes appear to utilize allochthonous, humic substances as a substrate.																			0018-8158					FEB 21	1992	229						93	106		10.1007/BF00006993	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006993													WOS:A1992HL35400008

Evaluating Signal Preemption Requests in Utah Using Vehicle-to-Everything Dedicated Short-Range Communication Equipped Snowplows	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD												At the start of the 2019 to 2020 snow season, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) systems using dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) were placed on Utah Department of Transportation snowplows and traffic signal controllers on selected state routes. This study was conducted to understand the overall impacts of snowplows using V2X DSRC to request signal preemption. Roadside units (RSUs) were deployed on five corridors throughout the Salt Lake metropolitan area. Similar routes without RSUs were selected as a control and were used in the analysis to quantify results. Each snowplow on these corridors was equipped with an onboard unit (OBU). Based on data collected, analysis was performed on both traffic signal performance and vehicle performance data. Within the traffic signal performance analysis, it was found that the V2X DSRC system was utilized often, with snowplows requesting preemption in more 50% of the occasions they approached a signalized intersection. Of those requests, signal controllers granted preemption in over 80% of cases. On average, signal controller coordination was affected for less than 5 min. The vehicle performance analysis found that the snowplows on equipped routes had travel speeds that were less affected when there was snow than on corresponding not-equipped routes. Vehicle crash data also showed that there was a greater decrease in crashes on equipped routes than not-equipped routes. Anecdotal evidence gathered from snowplow drivers indicated that snowplows stopped less when using signal preemption. Drivers also noted a benefit to overall snow removal operations on corridors equipped with the V2X DSRC system.																			0361-1981	2169-4052				AUG	2024	2678	8					417	430		10.1177/03611981231216976	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03611981231216976		JAN 2024											WOS:001137175700001

F.; Mayer, Christine M.; Sakas, Alexis			Larval Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) zooplankton consumption remains constant despite variation in prey densities in western Lake Erie	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Larval fish growth and survival could be limited or reduced due to patchiness of zooplankton densities, even in productive aquatic systems. Recent declines in Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) populations prompted research to identify underlying mechanisms controlling survival at early life stages. In Lake Erie, the bottleneck window controlling year-class strength of Lake Whitefish likely occurs during the first growing season, suggesting that availability of important prey could influence year-class strength. Therefore, spatial and temporal larval Lake Whitefish distribution, diet, and prey utilization were evaluated in western Lake Erie. The pelagic Lake Whitefish larval period in the western basin extends from April 1 to May 15 with most larvae concentrated nearshore at the surface both day and night. Cyclopoid copepods were the most important prey item; however, calanoid copepods and Cladocera were consistently consumed, indicating that copepods and Cladocera were important larval Lake Whitefish prey items. Copepod and Cladocera biomass were the highest nearshore, overlapping with the highest larval Lake Whitefish densities. However, the amount of food consumed by larvae was consistent in all areas, suggesting that offshore areas in western Lake Erie with relatively low zooplankton biomass harbor enough food to satiate larval Lake Whitefish. Therefore, it is unlikely that prey availability limits survival through means of starvation during the larval phase.																			1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-MAR	2024	27	1					85	97		10.14321/aehm.027.01.85	http://dx.doi.org/10.14321/aehm.027.01.85													WOS:001326942900007

Based on Escherichia coli results, beach closures are made. During 2019, artificial neural network based E. coli prediction tool was created to identify the E. coli classes using 13 input parameters observed together with E. coli. For this now-cast model, two classes were considered for the final model output [(1) for safe level with E. coli counts less than 235 CFU/100 mL, and (2) for E. coli counts more than 235 colony forming units/100 mL]. This year, IDEM recommended to update this model with additional data observed during 2020 through 2022. All the 13 inputs (including water temperature, pH, total dissolved solids, total suspended solids, turbidity, trashes, bird counts, color, odor, electrical conductivity) used in the 2019 model were collected from the beaches together with E. coli data during 2020-2022. This research paper presents the phase II results. After initial data consolidation, updated database had 761 data for the considered five beaches. After examining several architecture types for the feedforward neural network model, the best model was identified. The model was cross-validated by dividing the data into four blocks. New model results provided an overall predicting success of 93% for the two classes considered. However, the class 1 and class 2 prediction accuracies decreased from the original model developed using 2019 data. Class 1 and class 2 were predicted correctly 93% and 79%, respectively. It resulted in a 10% decrease in class 2 predictions. In this research work, a systematic review was conducted of the various ANN model results in different development stages, and the performance was examined for each year.																					978-0-7844-8547-7				2024							438	442																WOS:001229341100039

Culture -dependent and independent methods have been applied to identify prokaryotic microbial diversity in Tuz Lake. However, the key processes and genes involved in biogeochemical cycles in Tuz Lake have not been investigated seasonally. The aim of the study is to investigate seasonal gene profiling in Tuz Lake associated with biogeochemical cycling and thereby reveal more about the ecosystem dynamics of this extreme environment. Therefore, the PICRUSt2 tool was applied to analyze the metabolic function of archaeal and bacterial diversity in Tuz Lake. As a result of metabolic functions based on 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing data, it was observed that methane production by H2 and CO2 by anaerobic archaea in Tuz Lake was the predominant methanogenesis pathway. It was determined that sulfur oxidation was the dominant sulfur metabolism, while the reductive citric acid cycle was the dominant carbon fixation pathway.

Growth parameters of the clupeids Limnothrissa miodon and Stolothrissa tanganicae in northern Lake Tanganyika (Bujumbura sub-basin)	BELGIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The analysis of growth parameters in fish stocks, such as the asymptotic length (L infinity) infinity ) and the curvature parameter (K), is crucial for the estimation of production rates and total mortality rates in fisheries management. Here, we estimated the growth parameters of the clupeids Limnothrissa miodon and Stolothrissa tanganicae in the northern part of Lake Tanganyika (Bujumbura sub-basin). Both species are important targets of pelagic fisheries, but the available estimates are based on scarce size frequency data, and rarely on size as a function of age data. We provide new estimates of L infinity infinity and K based on size as a function of age data, with age being inferred from otolith weights. Furthermore, we reanalyze several existing length frequency datasets using advanced statistical procedures to test if growth parameters estimated by length frequency analysis are consistent with those obtained from size as a function of age. We found that length frequency analysis consistently underestimates L infinity infinity and overestimates K as compared to length-at-age data. We recommend that length-at-age data are collected at a much broader spatial and temporal scale than currently available to advance our understanding of the growth dynamics of these two sardine species. This will improve the assessment of stock productivity of Lake Tanganyika's pelagic fisheries and the conservation of these economically important fish species.

An extended quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA-GRI) was developed based on the two in situ datasets collected from inland waters of Lake Qiandaohu (QDH) and oceanic waters of the East China Sea (ECS). The key model between absorption coefficients at 510 nm (a(510)) and green red index (GRI) was established using power function in the extended QAA-GRI algorithm. The results reveal that the extended QAA-GRI algorithm performs better than the original quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA-v5) and Garver-Siegel-Maritorena's algorithm (GSM), and the red-green quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA-RGR), at least for the two in situ datasets from the ECS and QDH. For QAA-GRI, the averaged mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) value of retrieved versus in situ total absorption coefficients is approximately 20%. Subsequently, the extended QAA-GRI algorithm was applied to the OLCI satellite imagery, which is the new successor of MERIS with three specific bands (510, 560, and 620 nm). The implementation of the extended QAA-GRI algorithm on OLCI imagery yielded similar results comparable to that of the QAA-v5 in the ECS region. Furthermore, the application of the algorithm on seasonal and annual MERIS satellite imagery help clarify the combined influences from Yangtze River discharge and coastal currents on the distribution of total absorption in the ECS waters. This study suggests that the extended QAA-GRI algorithm is an alternative for retrieving total absorption coefficient, although it is not recommended for highly turbid waters.

Remotely sensed evapotranspiration and precipitation products were used to validate TWSA. Over 2002-2012 TWSA showed little variability, albeit with a strong seasonal cycle related to precipitation. However, since 2013 the trend has been generally positive. This finding appears counterintuitive given the expansion of irrigation but can be explained by the strong impacts of teleconnections on precipitation and underdevelopment of groundwater. Combining GRACE and satellite altimetry has provided useful insights into lakeaquifer interactions.

Here we evaluate challenges and opportunities for the management of the lake. We focused on the stream discharging to the lake (i.e., external loading), sediment retention in accumulation basins (i.e., internal processes) as well as the ecosystem-level response to stressors based on biological variables (phyto- and zooplankton, macrophytes, fishes and zoobenthos). Urban and agricultural inputs elevated ammonium and total phosphorus concentrations in the lake, challenging lake reconstruction efforts. Sediment transport highly increased the risk of faster filling of the lake, associated with upstream streambed excavation. Sediments trapped at the accumulation basins release nutrients that enhance eutrophication. We, however, observed a rapid recovery in fish, macrophytes, and zoobenthos, despite the significant disturbances. Lake Mustij & auml;rv is in eutrophic condition, reflected by phytoplankton ( Pseudanabaena, Closteriopsis dominance) and zooplankton ( Keratella , Polyarthra dominance) composition. To improve lake water quality will require controlling external nutrient inputs, underlining the importance of better coordinated activities between the local (lake restoration) and regional (catchment use) scales.

Its application enables nuanced evaluations, aiding in effective decision-making for sustainable environmental management and conservation of water resources. This paper presents an intelligent approach to assess water quality in Vartur Lake using a Fuzzy Logic-based expert system which incorporates linguistic variables and fuzzy membership functions to provide a nuanced evaluation of water quality parameters across different seasons. Through meticulous definition of fuzzy membership functions and iterative rule base optimization, the proposed approach demonstrates the effectiveness of fuzzy logic in handling uncertainty and variability in water quality data, resulting in a robust and adaptable framework for water quality assessment. The results highlight the advantages of the Fuzzy Water Quality Index (FWQI) over traditional Water Quality Index (WQI) methods, showcasing its flexibility, adaptability to seasonal variations, and ability to provide a more comprehensive understanding of water quality conditions, thereby offering valuable insights for environmental management and decision-making. By leveraging Fuzzy Logic's ability to handle imprecise information, the proposed approach offers a valuable tool for environmental monitoring and management, contributing to the sustainable preservation of Vartur Lake's ecosystem and surrounding communities.					; NATARAJAN, SANTHI/MFH-3026-2025	Teggi, Pralhad/0000-0002-2799-2826; 													2334-0940		979-8-3503-8593-9; 979-8-3503-8592-2				2024										10.1109/CONECCT62155.2024.10677192	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CONECCT62155.2024.10677192													WOS:001332800800171
J	Thongdang, W; Chaichana, R				Thongdang, Wasinee; Chaichana, Ratcha			Influence of water quality and seasonal variations on freshwater macroinvertebrate diversity and community structure in wastewater treatment ponds, Phetchaburi Province, Thailand	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Wastewater originating from the Phetchaburi municipality undergoes treatment in a series of five distinct stages at the King's Royally involve a sedimentation (pond 1), three oxidation ponds (ponds 2 to 4), and a final stabilization pond (pond 5). These ponds serve as habitats for macroinvertebrates; consequently, their diversity and composition might be influenced by fluctuations in water quality and seasonal variations. The primary aim of this research was to analyze the diversity and species composition of macroinvertebrate communities concerning varying levels of organic contamination across the five wastewater treatment ponds at LERD. This investigation spanned three seasons: cold season (December 2019), rainy season (July 2020), and hot season (April 2021). The findings revealed that the diversity and species composition of macroinvertebrate communities displayed distinct alterations across multiple environmental gradients, especially identifying the significant influence of organic loading levels observed in ponds 1 to 5. The macroinvertebrate communities exhibited two distinct groupings, with the Chironomidae and Candonidae or ostracods prevailing prominently in ponds 1 and 2 (heterogenous environments). This prevalence was attributed to the high levels of detrital food and the robust resilience of chironomid larvae and ostracods to organic pollution, thriving even in environments characterized by low dissolved oxygen levels. Conversely, the prevalence of snails from the Thiaridae family in ponds 3 to 5 (homogenous environments) indicated improved water quality conditions, notably lower organic matter levels, and a higher dissolved oxygen content. In addition, the study identified seasonal variations in macroinvertebrates, likely influenced by the differing organic loading and environmental conditions. Thus, this research provided insights into the factors shaping macroinvertebrate communities in a wastewater treatment system.																			1129-5767	1723-8633					2024	83								2178	10.4081/jlimnol.2024.2178	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2024.2178													WOS:001247132400001

Spatiotemporal responses of ungulates to hunting in a fenced multi-use area	WILDLIFE RESEARCH												Context Human activities, such as tourism and hunting, affect the spatiotemporal behaviour of wildlife. For example, it is well documented that ungulates change their spatiotemporal behaviour as a response to hunting pressure, but less is known about ungulate responses to hunting in areas where human activity is common throughout the year and ungulates are constrained by fences.Aims In this camera-trap study, we analysed the change in spatiotemporal behaviour of wild ungulates (elk, Cervus canadensis (3519 events), moose, Alces alces (1153 events), and white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus (2708 events)) in response to the hunting period in a recreational and fenced park, the Cooking Lake-Blackfoot Provincial Area, Canada.Methods We used general linear models to compare species-specific patterns of intensity of use, calculated as events per week, in response to changes in the nature of human disturbance, namely a shift from recreation to hunting activity. In particular, we compared intensity of use in and out of the hunting season to determine whether species engaged in spatial patterns of avoidance with respect to hunting. We used daily and seasonal patterns of activity to determine how ungulates shifted their temporal use in response to hunting activity and whether they became more nocturnal as a result.Key results We found that ungulates responded temporally to the hunting period by generally shifting their activity to more nocturnal hours, with white-tailed deer showing the biggest temporal shift, suggesting that the ungulates distinguish between consumptive and non-consumptive human activities. Nevertheless, temporal overlap between humans and all ungulate species increased during the hunting period as humans targeted times of increased ungulate activity. Spatially, the response was less distinctive and was species-specific. Elk showed little change in spatial behaviour in response to the hunting period. In contrast, moose decreased the use of trail areas and other areas frequented by humans, whereas deer, counterintuitively, increased the use of trail areas, albeit their use became much more nocturnal.Conclusions We have shown that responses of ungulates to hunting exceed those to non-consumptive recreational use, and whereas temporal responses (increased nocturnality) were consistent across ungulate species, spatial responses were species-specific.Implications Management in small fenced multi-use areas needs to account for shifts in the intensity of disturbance resulting from a change in human disturbance from recreational activity to hunting. Providing spatial opportunities for avoidance of humans is key for most species if hours of operation in these areas already limit the timing of human activity. Human use, including recreation and hunting, can disturb wildlife and this can be particularly problematic in fenced multi-use landscapes. This study aimed to investigate how human use, which switched from recreation-based disturbance to hunting, changed the patterns of use by native ungulates in space and time and we found consistent patterns of temporal avoidance, whereas patterns of spatial avoidance were species-specific. We make recommendations for how to minimise human impacts in multi-use recreational landscapes. Image by Darcy Visscher.

We applied the methods of phylogenetic analysis, DNA taxonomy, and statistical analysis to study the temporal distribution patterns of the cryptic B. calyciflorus species, an excellent model, in three lakes, and to explore the putative mechanisms for their seasonal succession and temporal overlap. The results showed that in the warm-temperate Lake Yunlong, B. fernandoi and B. calyciflorus s.s. underwent a seasonal succession, which was largely attributed to their differential adaptation to water temperature. In the subtropical Lake Jinghu, B. fernandoi, B. calyciflorus s.s., and B. dorcas exhibited both seasonal succession and temporal overlap. Seasonal successions were largely attributed to their differential adaptation to temperature, and temporal overlap resulted from their differential responses to algal food concentration. In the tropical Lake Jinniu, B. calyciflorus s.s. persisted throughout the year and overlapped with B. dorcas for 5 months. The temporal overlap resulted from their differential responses to copepod predation. These results indicated that the temporal distribution pattern of the cryptic B. calyciforus species and the mechanism that allows competitor coexistence vary with different climate zones.

The West Kunlun mountain (WKM) is at the center of the Karakoram Anomaly; however, insufficient systematic studies have been conducted to determine glacier velocities in this region. This study reports annual and seasonal variations in glacier velocity and the characteristics of glacier surges in the WKM between 2013 and 2023 using multisource remote sensing data. Results show that the annual average velocity exhibits a slightly increasing trend (0.48 +/- 0.16 m/yr), mainly owing to increasing glacier thickness. Larger glaciers flow faster than smaller ones, and glaciers with northern and southern slopes flow faster than those with slopes in other directions. Glacial velocities in 2016 and 2021 were 13.78 +/- 3.54 and 13.65 +/- 2.56 m/yr, respectively, which are higher than those in neighboring years. Velocities are approximately 4.3 m/yr higher during the warm season than in the cold season. Temperature and precipitation are the primary factors influencing annual and seasonal variations in glacier velocities. In total, 10 verified surging glaciers were observed during the period 2013-2023, with peak velocities ranging from 42.95 to 865.16 m/yr. The active, accelerating, and decelerating phases of b1 and b2 of West Kunlun as well as Alakesayi, Zhongfeng, and G2 lasted approximately 3-6 years. The active phase of G11 may have lasted more than 23 years, whereas the active phases of Gongxing, Litian, G24, and G26 lasted no longer than 2 years.																			1939-1404	2151-1535					2024	17						10703	10714		10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3408451	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3408451													WOS:001248303200002

The Atoyac population is unique because of a high degree of polymorphism, including both macromelanophore spotting and a micromelanophore tailspot pattern. During the dry season males living in the same area maintained a linear social hierarchy for periods of many days. The subordinate males settled down either in the same home ranges or in home ranges largely overlapping with that of dominant males. Although dominant males untiringly chased the subordinate males away, they returned persistently and achieved the status of non-tolerated satellites. Females were less stationary and presumably passed through many male home ranges during their feeding activities. The data clearly demonstrate that green swordtails live in complex social systems in which male-male competition and probably also female mate choice are likely to be essential factors for individual reproductive success.

J	VANDEBUND, W; GROENENDIJK, D				VANDEBUND, W; GROENENDIJK, D			SEASONAL DYNAMICS AND BURROWING OF LITTORAL CHIRONOMID LARVAE IN RELATION TO COMPETITION AND PREDATION	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The seasonal dynamics and burrowing in the sediment of the four larval instars of the chironomid Stictochironomus sticticus were followed at two sampling sites in the sandy littoral zone of an oligo-mesotrophic lake. This information was related to the densities and burrowing pattern of other chironomid taxa, and the occurrence of predation by bream. A clear relation between Stictochironomus larval instar and burrowing depth was found, with later instars burrowing deeper. In late May, synchronous settlement of the first generation took place; a less synchronous second generation settled in August. The timing of the development of Stictochironomus differed among the two sampling sites because the transition from the first to the second instar occurred two weeks later at one of the sites, where the settling density was higher. This timing difference, most likely caused by intraspecific density effects, persisted throughout the sampling period, even in the second generation. Bream foraged in the sediment from the middle of July. At one site, the Stictochironomus larvae were in the fourth instar then, burrowing deeper than 2 cm; at that depth they are out of reach of the bream. At the other site, many larvae were still found in surface sediment layers due to the delayed development. Consequently, predation losses were high there; although peak densities of the earlier instars were at least twice as high, fourth-instar larval densities were almost the same at the two sites. Stictochironomus was found to be temporally and spatially segregated from the principle other chironomid taxa, Cladotanytarsus mancus and Polypedilum sp.; these did not reach high densities before larvae of the first Stictochironomus generation had almost completely disappeared from the top 1 cm of the sediment. Cladotanytarsus became very abundant from July, when bream began to feed in the sediment; bream is not able to feed on this species due to its small size and protecting sand-tube.						van de Bund, Wouter/0000-0002-2749-0850													0003-9136					DEC	1994	132	2					213	225																WOS:A1994QA25900006
J	CYRUS, DP; BLABER, SJM				CYRUS, DP; BLABER, SJM			THE INFLUENCE OF TURBIDITY ON JUVENILE MARINE FISHES IN ESTUARIES .1. FIELD STUDIES AT LAKE ST-LUCIA ON THE SOUTHEASTERN COAST OF AFRICA	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Lake St. Lucia, the largest estuarine system in Africa (325 km2), was chosen as the field study area for a 3.5-yr (1980-83) investigation into relationships between water turbidity and estuarine fish distribution. The variety of habitats, from clear water, open sandy shores to shallow muddy substrata and turbid waters, together with high species diversity (108 species) rendered the area suitable for this study. The relationships between fish distribution and environmental factors were monitored by monthly seine netting of fishes at seven sites representative of the range of conditions in St. Lucia. Simultaneously, water turbidity, salinity, and temperature were recorded. The possible influences of substratum type and food availability were also investigated by using recently published data on invertebrate benthos and zooplankton distributions. Published data were also used to determine the diet of the common fish species. The results showed that the distribution of juveniles of the 20 commonest fish species were statistically correlated only with water turbidity, water temperature, and food availability. The correlation with temperature was related to seasonal not spatial temperature patterns. Turbidity and food type influences were difficult to separate but exceptions were the anchovy Thryssa vitrirostris (Gilchrist and Thompson) and the sole Solea bleekeri Boulenger which occurred only in turbid water despite the widespread occurrence of their prey, and Gerres acinaces Bleeker, G. rappi (Barnard), and G. filamentosus Cuvier, all of which occurred only in clear water although the greatest densities of their bivalve prey were in turbid waters. Similarly, the sparids Rhabdosargus holubi (Steindachner) and R. sarba (Forsskal) were distributed according to turbidity and not their preferred foods. Principal component analysis with a minimum spanning tree plot and a canonical correlation test showed that the fish fauna could be divided into five groups according to their occurrence in various turbidities. These were: clear water species (e.g. Gerreidae) in < 10 NTU, clear to partially turbid species (e.g. Liza dumerilii (Steindachner) and L. macrolepis (Smith)) in < 50 NTU, intermediate turbidity species (e.g. Valamugil cunnesius (Valenciennes) and Leiognathus equula (Forsskal)) in 10-80 NTU, turbid-water species (e.g. Elops machnata (Forsskal) and Thryssa virirostris) in > 50 NTU, and species indifferent to turbidity (e.g. Acanthopagrus berda (Forsskal) and Terapon jarbua (Forsskal). It is, therefore, suggested that turbidity plays a significant role, either singly, or in combination with other variables in determining the distribution of juvenile marine fishes in estuaries.																			0022-0981	1879-1697				JUL 7	1987	109	1					53	70		10.1016/0022-0981(87)90185-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-0981(87)90185-7													WOS:A1987J235500005

Observed catches included three species of penaeid prawns, while observed by-catches contained a total of 49 finfish and 5 invertebrate taxa. The overall by-catch: prawn catch ratio by weight was 0.9:1, and in catching an estimated 20 +/-4 t of prawns the fleet took an estimated total by-catch of 19 +/-2 t throughout the 6-month fishing season. The by-catch included large numbers of small (<15 cm total length) finfish species important in other commercial and recreational fisheries, including Gerres subfasciatus, Rhabdosargus sarba and Acanthopagrus australis, as well as several small demersal species of little economic value. Multivariate analyses indicated that by-catch composition differed between seines taken over shallow seagrass and bare substrata, with catch rates of several species being greater over seagrass. It is recommended that strategies to reduce potential ecological impacts and by-catch in this fishery be investigated, including fixed spatial closures over seagrasses and the development of alternative fishing gears and practices.																			1323-1650						2001	52	7					987	993		10.1071/MF00121	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF00121													WOS:000172176800005
J	Jobidon, R; Charette, L				Jobidon, R; Charette, L			Effects ten years later of simple or repeated manual release from competing vegetation and of weed cutting periods on the growth of black spruce seedlings	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE												The effectiveness of manual release to favor growth and survival of black spruce seedlings was determined in eastern Quebec plantations. Up to three releases over as many consecutive years, and two weed cutting methods, were tested for two types of competing vegetation composed of either raspberry and fireweed (Squatec site) or shade intolerant deciduous trees (Lake Anna site). Five weed cutting periods, from June through October, were also tested at this last site. Seedling growth and survival were not affected by the number of releases. At the Squatec site, seedlings released with a brush cutter were 24% larger in diameter at the collar, and on average 12% higher, than untreated seedlings after 10 years. Weed cutting during the growth season (June through September) enhanced seedling growth. At the Lake Anna site, the best growth enhancement was produced by cutting out all competing vegetation. Seedlings in these plots were 53% larger in diameter at the collar and on average 79% higher than control seedlings. Effects of the realease treatments on height and diameter growth increased with time relative to untreated seedlings, showing that treatments had a long-lasting effect. Furthermore, a variance analysis of skewness and kurtosis coefficients was used to determine the effect of competition on the structure of seedling dimensions. After 10 years at the Squatec site, diameter and height distributions were skewed to the left and to the right, respectively. After the same lapse of time at Lake Anna, height and diameter distributions in released plots were skewed to the right opposite to the left in untreated plots. At both experimental sites, seedling dimensions were arranged in a hierarchical manner nearly always similar between released and control plots as a result of competition effects that were lasting since the time of release. Results suggest that release effects should be examined not only on the average growth of seedlings but also on stand structure.																			0045-5067					DEC	1997	27	12					1979	1991		10.1139/cjfr-27-12-1979	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-27-12-1979													WOS:000072121000010

The timing of the switch from production of subitaneous (immediately hatching) eggs to diapausing eggs for both species is in October. This timing is consistent with a pattern, reviewed here, for other populations of diaptomid copepods: populations living in large lakes tend to begin production of diapausing eggs later in the season than those living in small lakes. Populations living in temporary ponds tend to switch still earlier in the season. All populations reviewed here live in the north temperate zone. The sediments of Oneida Lake contain densities of diaptomid diapausing eggs on the order of 10(5) m-2 per cm below the sediment surface down to 5 cm. Below this sediment depth, egg densities decline. The highest egg densities were found in sediments under the deepest water. Diapausing eggs of L. minutus survive in the sediments at least two years, as shown by the recovery of the population after a year in which no new diapausing eggs were produced, and probably for two or more decades. Long-term dormancy can have the effect of ensuring the continuation of a population through periods of poor recruitment, and can help create conditions for the coexistence of competing species. Other investigators have suggested that S. oregonensis and L. minutus are competitors in other lakes when they co-occur.																			0018-8158					NOV 25	1994	293						209	218																WOS:A1994QG90200029

AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY												Across North America, Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) populations appear to be recovering following bans of DDT. A limited number of studies from across North America have recorded a surplus of nonbreeding adult Bald Eagles in dense populations when optimal habitat and food become limited. Placentia Bay, Newfoundland is one of these. The area has one of the highest densities of Bald Eagles in eastern North America, and has recently experienced an increase in the proportion of nonbreeding adults within the population. We tested whether the observed Bald Eagle population trends in Placentia Bay, Newfoundland during the breeding seasons 1990-2009 are due to habitat saturation. We found no significant differences in habitat or food resource characteristics between occupied territories and pseudo-absence data or between nest sites with high vs. low nest activity/occupancy rates. Therefore there is no evidence for habitat saturation for Bald Eagles in Placentia Bay and alternative hypotheses for the high proportion of nonbreeding adults should be considered. The Newfoundland population provides an interesting case for examination because it did not historically appear to be affected by pollution. An understanding of Bald Eagle population dynamics in a relatively pristine area with a high density can be informative for restoration and conservation of Bald Eagle populations elsewhere.

J	Fadali, E; Shaw, WD				Fadali, E; Shaw, WD			Can recreation values for a lake constitute a market for banked agricultural water?	CONTEMPORARY ECONOMIC POLICY												This paper presents estimates of the recreational use value to prevent the loss of a western lake threatened by diversions of upstream waters that supply it. The recreation demand model used to estimate recreation-related values is the popular repeated nested multinomial logit model.

Variation of three antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and effects of Cd exposure in a whole lake experiment on these enzymes were investigated in liver from three freshwater fish species, (Pearl Dace (Semotilus margarita), White Sucker (Catostomus commersoni) and Lake Chaff (Salvelinus namaycush)). 2. Enzymatic activity varied significantly between different lakes in geographical proximity. 3. Other than GPx activity, which was lower in Lake Charr, activities of the three enzymes were not different between the three fish species. 4. Seasonal variation was observed in both CAT and SOD activities. 5. Cd exposure resulted in increased liver concentrations of the metal, but metallothionein protein did not significantly increase. 6. SOD activity in liver of fish exposed to Cd was consistently higher than in liver of fish from reference lakes.

J	Klok, PF; van der Velde, G				Klok, Peter F.; van der Velde, Gerard			Initial decomposition of floating leaf blades of Nymphoides peltata (SG Gmel.) O. Kuntze (Menyanthaceae): causes, impact and succession	PEERJ												Background: During a study on the outdoor floating leaf blade production of Nymphoides peltata (S.G. Gmel.) O. Kuntze (Fringed Water Lily), initial leaf blade decomposition was studied by simultaneously measuring infected, damaged and lost area of floating leaf blades. Methods: Data on initial decomposition over time were collected for all leaves during one growth season in four plots: two in outdoor mesocosms and two in an oxbow lake. Each leaf was tagged uniquely upon appearance in a plot. The vegetation in the mesocosms differed with respect to plant species, one contained a monoculture of N. peltata and the other N. peltata associated with Glyceria fluitans (L.) R. Br. and G. maxima (Hartm.) Holmb. The lake plots were situated within a monospecific N. peltata stand, differing in depth and position within the stand. Leaf length, visually estimated percentages of damaged area for each damage type, and decay of the tagged leaves were recorded bi-weekly. When the leaf blades sunk under the water surface or disappeared completely, they were no longer followed. Under water the leaves decayed and were consumed by snails completely, so contributing to the detritus food chain. Results: The observed causes of damage on floating leaves were consumption and/or damage by waterbirds (Fulica atra), pond snails, caterpillars (Elophila nymphaeata, Cataclysta lemnata), chironomid larvae (Cricotopus trifasciatus), infection by a phytopathogenic fungus (Septoria villarsiae), senescence by autolysis, and microbial decay. Successional changes in causes of leaf decomposition and impacts of different causes are discussed.					van der Velde, Gerard/C-7776-2011; Klok, Peter/AAF-7393-2019														2167-8359					DEC 21	2023	11								e16689	10.7717/peerj.16689	http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.16689								38144198					WOS:001134069100001
J	LAYBOURNPARRY, J; ROGERSON, A				LAYBOURNPARRY, J; ROGERSON, A			SEASONAL PATTERNS OF PROTOZOOPLANKTON IN LAKE WINDERMERE, ENGLAND	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The protozoan plankton of Lake Windermere in the English Lake District was investigated during the period March to October, 1989. Flagellates, both heterotrophic and phototrophic, and ciliates dominated the protozooplankton. Sarcodines were present at low levels throughout except on a few occasions when gymnamoebae reached 501(-1) and heliozoans 5501(-1). Peak ciliate abundance occurred during March to May in both the north and south basins of the lake, while the numerically dominant flagellate community displayed considerable variation in numbers throughout the study period. The ciliate community was dominated by oligotrichs, particularly the mixotroph Strombidium viride, vorticellids and tintinnids. The relative proportions of each group varied as a function of the trophic status of the waters. In the more oligotrophic north basin the community was dominated by oligotrichs, whereas in the more eutrophic south basin tintinnids and vorticellids were the major component. The south basin supported higher concentrations of both flagellates and ciliates. No correlation was established between chlorophyll-a concentration and ciliate abundance or between flagellate density and ciliate abundance.																			0003-9136					NOV	1993	129	1					25	43																WOS:A1993MM47400002

Geochemical partitioning of sediment-bound phosphorous in Thrissur Kole Wetlands, Southwest India: Status of bioavailability and trophic state	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Sediment-bound phosphorous fractions were analyzed to assess the bioavailability and trophic status of Thrissur Kole wetlands. Sequential extraction followed by spectrophotometry was employed for fractionation and determination of phosphate content in each fraction. Acid soluble organic phosphorous comprising of biological molecules was the most dominant fraction [278.02 +/- 11.82 mg/kg (non-monsoon); 315.77 +/- 13.84 mg/kg (monsoon)] recorded during both seasons and can be sourced to allochthonous as well as autochthonous sources. Elevated content of alkali soluble organic phosphorous [162.53 +/- 14.85 mg/kg (non-monsoon); 307.22 +/- 14.60 mg/kg (monsoon)] reflected leaching of humic-associated phosphorous from aquatic vegetation, domestic and municipal sewage. Enrichment of calcium-bound phosphorous was due to the abundance of calcium carbonate originating through biological precipitation and inputs from guano as well as carcass of birds. Enriched organic matter adsorbed on fine-grained sediments controls the retention of organic phosphorous through organic matter-iron-phosphorous association. Intense microbial reworking on organic matter (substantiated by depleted Eh values) resulted in a sharp decline in organic phosphorous fraction. Adsorption of iron/manganese oxyhydroxides was a prominent mechanism in the retention of phosphate in sediments, endorsed by multivariate statistical analysis. Alkaline pH and reducing environment promote the release of phosphate to the water column and hence bioavailability for phytoplankton uptake. Bioavailable phosphorous constitutes a major portion of total phosphorous [average: 606.86 +/- 26.24 mg/kg (non-monsoon); 651.36 +/- 23.05 mg/kg (monsoon)], which implied that the wetland sediments can function as a dynamic source of phosphate to the water column, signaling eutrophication risk.

Significant differences in the electrophoretic composition of fractions were revealed between river and lake humic substances. Soil and river humic substances contain significantly more high-molecular fractions than lake humic substances. The seasonal sampling conditions have no effect on the electrophoretic mobility and fractional composition of soil and water humic substances.

The information was also used to qualitatively compare siscowet and lean lake trout (S. namaycush) diets. Stomachs from siscowet less than 500-mm total length (TL) contained primarily macroinvertebrates (clams, Mysis relicta, and insects), sculpins (Cottidae; mean TL = 45 mm), and coregonines (Coregonus spp.; mean TL = 120 mm). Stomachs from siscowet between 500- and 699-mm TL contained items similar to smaller siscowet, but burbot (Lota lota; mean TL = 162 mm and a 254-min siscowet were also present. Stomachs from siscowet longer than 699-mm TL contained fishes such as burbot (mean TL = 246 mm) and coregonines (mean TL = 240 mm). Dietary proportions of coregonines increased significantly with increasing siscowet length groups. The proportion of the total number of identified taxa and frequency of occurrence of terrestrial insects and sculpins declined significantly across all length groups between June and December. Siscowet and lean lake trout diets were not found to be substantially different and a potential for competition exists.																			0380-1330						1996	22	2					463	468		10.1016/S0380-1330(96)70970-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(96)70970-X													WOS:A1996VC21200028

Stemming from an increased focus on seasonal water demand management, we use the Salt Lake City, Utah municipal water system as a test bed to assess model accuracy versus complexity trade-offs between simple climate-independent econometric-based models and complex climate-sensitive data-driven models to average to extreme wet and dry climate conditions-representative of a new climate normal. The climate-independent model displayed low performance during extreme dry conditions with predictions exceeding 90% and 40% of the observed monthly and seasonal volumetric demands, respectively, which we attribute to insufficient model complexity. The climate-sensitive models displayed greater accuracy in all conditions, with an ordinary least squares model demonstrating a measurable reduction in prediction bias (3.4% vs. -27.3%) and RMSE (74.0 lpcd vs. 294 lpcd) compared to the climate-independent model. The climate-sensitive workflow increased model accuracy and characterized climate-demand interactions, demonstrating a novel tool to enhance water system management.					; Johnson, Ryan/HPG-0764-2023	Hassan, Daniyal/0000-0001-8812-7230; Aziz, Danyal/0000-0002-0734-6894; Johnson, Ryan/0000-0003-2195-739X													1093-474X	1752-1688				APR	2024	60	2					687	706		10.1111/1752-1688.13186	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.13186		DEC 2023											WOS:001123764900001
J	Schweizer, A				Schweizer, A			From littoral to pelagial: Comparing the distribution of phytoplankton and ciliated protozoa along a transect	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton and ciliates were examined at several stations from littoral to pelagial over 2 years. Special interest lay on the evaluation of the interchange between the littoral and pelagic community. The phytoplankton succession showed recurrent features at all stations along the transect. In the annual mean total phytoplankton biomass decreased from littoral towards midlake. The algal assemblage of the littoral waterbody was strongly influenced by detached phytobenthos species, mostly pennate diatoms, which diminished rapidly after the slope. Chlorophytes and cyanophytes also decreased along the transect. Cryptophytes and dinophytes showed different distribution gradients. Species of the same class could reveal countercurrent distribution patterns. The mean annual diversity index reached highest values nearshore. The ciliated protozoa also revealed recurrent species succession at all stations. However, they exhibited far less prominent gradients along the transect. Among the numerically most important representatives were Oligotrichidae in the annual mean which reached similar abundances at all stations, whereas Prostomatidae increased towards the pelagial. A further conspicuous difference between phytoplankton and ciliates was the fact that benthic ciliate species could only seldom be found in the littoral water samples. Nearshore and offshore water masses and the organisms therein were in a continuous mutual exchange. Thus a per se littoral water body does not exist in this part of Lake Constance.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				JUL	1997	19	7					829	848		10.1093/plankt/19.7.829	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/19.7.829													WOS:A1997XK00500004

A total of 2,511 data from 18 dual purpose farms, located on the basin of the Maracaibo Lake, at Zulia state, Venezuela, was analyzed. The effect of zone (El Laberinto, Perija, Costa Oriental del Lago, Sur del Lago), breed predominance (Holstein, Brown Swiss, Brahman, Carora), management system: improved (SM) and traditional (ST) and birth season (January-March, April-June, July-September, October-December) on age (ED), weight (PD) and daily weight gain (GDP) at weaning, as well as, its interactions were studied. For statistical analysis, Proc GLM of SAS software was used. In SM, the ED and PD were 9.7 +/- 0.1 m and, 162.2 +/- 1.1 kg, with GDP 11.8% (54.9 g/d) higher than in ST (P < 0.001). Perija zone had lower ED (9.3 +/- 0.2 m) and higher PD (179.0 +/- 0.9 kg) (P < 0.001). Both breed predominance x zone (P < 0.001) and breed predominance x management system interactions (P < 0.001) affected PD, been higher in Brown Swiss in Perija and El Laberinto (184.3 +/- 2.2 kg. and 168.9 +/- 2.9 kg). Also, season of birth x zone interaction, affected ED, PD and GDP (P < 0.001). The environment-genotype relationship had an influence on growth that showed to be significant and of great variability. Therefore, it is relevant to consider management and control of growth to optimize reproductive and productive performance of bovine females.																			0798-2259					MAY-JUN	2006	16	3					288	296																WOS:000238836700011
J	Sgro, GV; Ketterer, ME; Johansen, JR				Sgro, GV; Ketterer, ME; Johansen, JR			Ecology and assessment of the benthic diatom communities of four Lake Erie estuaries using Lange-Bertalot tolerance values	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Diatom composition of four Lake Erie estuaries was related to seasonal factors, year, location within the estuaries, and water quality parameters including nutrient and metals concentrations. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed seasonality as the most important factor determining variability in diatom species composition among sites and dates. Alkalinity, pH, silicate, orthophosphate, and nitrite concentrations were water chemistry parameters correlated with diatom community composition. Eigenvalues for the first two CCA axes of nutrient/physical data and species data were higher than the first two CCA axes of metals data and species data. In addition, the water quality of these estuaries was evaluated using an index composed of Lange-Bertalot pollution tolerance values. The Lange-Bertalot index scores indicated that the Ashtabula estuary had the best water quality of the study sites. Lange-Bertalot index scores were highly correlated with a gradient of disturbance represented by the first axis of a principle components analysis of sites and nutrient data (Spearman rho = 0.7). The Lange-Bertalot tolerance values could be useful for discriminating 'good' sites from "bad" sites among the Lake Erie estuaries.

The methane release rates were decreased from 6.1 +/- 0.7 mgCH(4)-m(-2)-h(-1) at top 5 cm depth to 2.6 mgCH(4)m(-2)-h(-1) at 20-30 cm depth of sediments. Overall methane release rate from sediments was 19.9 mgCH(4)-m(-2)-h(-1). The maximum specific acetate and H-2-utilization rates, v(m), were 5.2 x 10(-5) to 7.96 x 10(-6) and 0.9 x 10(-5) to 1.0 x 10(-4) gCOD-gVSS(-1)-h(-1) for the sediments collected in the depths of sediments, respectively. The half-velocity constant, K-s, were from 21 to 65.5 and 27 to 194 mgCOD-l(-1) for acetate- and H-2-utilizing methanogens in the depths of sediments, respectively. The acetate-utilizing methanogens were enumerated by the most probable number (MPN) technique, and showed the number of acetate-utilizing methanogens increases as the v(m) increases. The populational distributions were 5.27 x 10(8) to 2.8 x 10(8), and 1.2 x 10(8) MPN-gVSS(-1) at the sediments of top 20 and 20-30 cm, respectively.

The sediment of top 20 cm had high microbial activity compared with the deeper section at 20-30 cm depth. In addition, the number of H-2-utilizing methanogens was smaller than that of acetate-utilizing methanogens in the sediments.																			0043-1354					APR	1996	30	4					901	908		10.1016/0043-1354(95)00254-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(95)00254-5													WOS:A1996UC02200016

We examined waterfowl use of 15 wetland habitats in 132,000 km(2) of southern Ontario, Canada. We obtained data from plots that were surveyed by the Canadian Wildlife Service during 1981 and 1987. Open water lakes accounted for 47% of available habitat in the study area; however, they were avoided (P < 0.001) by blue-winged teal (Anas discors), mallards (A. platyrhynchos), and wood ducks (Aix sponsa). Beaver (Castor canadensis) ponds accounted for 25% of the wetland area and were preferred (P < 0.001) by wood ducks and were used by mallards, black ducks (A. rubripes), blue-winged teal, and ring-necked ducks (Aythya collaris). Other habitats composed 0-6% of available wetlands and accounted for 0-10% of waterfowl use on study plots in southern Ontario. The percentage of wetlands occupied by breeding waterfowl varied from 11% for bogs and seasonal basins to 50% for deciduous swamps. The more common breeding species in southern Ontario (mallard, wood duck, blue-winged teal) exploited many habitats. Management efforts should focus on emergent or wooded habitats, especially beaver ponds, that provide habitat for many breeding waterfowl.																			0022-541X					JUL	1995	59	3					527	532		10.2307/3802459	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3802459													WOS:A1995RH45500013
J	LAMPERT, W; ROTHHAUPT, KO				LAMPERT, W; ROTHHAUPT, KO			ALTERNATING DYNAMICS OF ROTIFERS AND DAPHNIA-MAGNA IN A SHALLOW LAKE	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Rotifers and Daphnia magna showed strongly alternating population fluctuations in Gro-beta-er Binnensee, a shallow, brackish water lake in Northern Germany. Daphnia appeared relatively late in the season and produced four pronounced biomass peaks between July and November. Three of the four peaks were associated with clear-water phases and reduced concentrations of sestonic carbon. The highest rotifer densities occurred before the daphnids appeared and, later in the season, the rotifer populations crashed when daphnids became abundant. Rotifer density was negatively correlated with Daphnia biomass but positively with POC levels. Most of the variation in rotifer abundance could be explained by fluctuations of POC levels, suggesting the existence of exploitative competition as a mechanism causing the inverse relationship between rotifers and daphnids. However, a closer inspection of the time course of events indicates that mechanical interference may also be a factor and may have increased in importance as the season progressed and as the average size of daphnid individuals increased.																			0003-9136					FEB	1991	120	4					447	456																WOS:A1991FB09800004
J	Russell, IA				Russell, Ian A.			Waterbird community changes in the Wilderness Lakes, South Africa (Part 1 of 3): Herbivores and omnivores	KOEDOE												Global and regional degradation and loss of aquatic systems can negatively affect wetland-dependent waterbirds. The Wilderness Lakes Complex in South Africa, which incorporates the Wilderness Ramsar site, supports populations of 68 waterbird species including eight which periodically occur in globally significant (>1% population) numbers. The study aimed to document long-term spatial and temporal (including seasonal) patterns of abundance of herbivorous waterbirds in the Wilderness Lakes Complex, and where possible identify potential causes for observed trends. The abundance of waterbirds on these wetlands was determined biannually from 1992 to 2019, with counts conducted from a boat following a standardised route. Historical abundance data from the 1980s was also used to describe long-term abundance changes. Observed seasonality of four herbivorous waterbirds differed from published accounts. Long-term abundance trends indicated a combination of declining, increasing and stable populations which, in several instances, differed from regional (southern African) assessments. Significant long-term decreases have occurred in five herbivorous species in the lakes complex (Common Moorhen Gallinula chloropus, Red-knobbed Coot Fulica cristata, Yellow-billed Duck Anas undulata, Cape Shoveler Anas smithii, Cape Teal Anas capensis), whereas increases have occurred in two species (Spurwinged Goose Plectropterus gambensis, Egyptian Goose Alopochen aegyptiaca). Similar types of change occurred across multiple waterbodies, and in different seasons. The similarity of trends in spatially separated wetlands suggested either high interconnectivity of populations between wetland systems and/or some drivers of change of mobile species being broad scaled and regional, rather than system specific. Local reasons for changes potentially include increasing extent of cultivated fields, a proliferation of emergent macrophytes and loss of open sandbanks, changing food availability, increasing disturbance, and disease.Conservation implications: The fundamental character of the Wilderness Ramsar site has changed, with reduced abundance of several previously abundant herbivorous waterbirds. Drivers of change in species abundances are multifaceted, complex, and frequently poorly understood. Recommended local corrective actions include the management of emergent macrophytes, avian diseases, disturbance, and water quality.																			0075-6458	2071-0771				DEC 6	2023	65	1							a1770	10.4102/koedoe.v65i1.1770	http://dx.doi.org/10.4102/koedoe.v65i1.1770													WOS:001130448500001

The available information from clinical samples is not enough to figure out their actual prevalence. The aim of this study was to gather information for the first time in Saudi Arabia on the presence of the Norovirus (NoV) genogroup GI and GII, hepatitis A virus (HAV), and hepatitis E virus (HEV) in water. For this purpose, thirteen monthly samples were collected from Lake Wadi Hanifa and surrounding wells from December 2014 to November 2015. Viruses were detected and quantified using real-time RT-qPCR. Despite HEV findings being anecdotic, our results highlight interesting behaviors of the other viruses. There was a higher prevalence of noroviruses in Wadi Hanifa samples than in well water samples (46.43% vs. 12.5% of NoV GI; 66.67% vs. 8.33% of NoV GII). On the contrary, similar levels of HAV positivity were observed (40.48% in surface water vs. 43.06% in well water). Also, a strong influence of flooding events on HAV and NoV GI occurrence was observed in both surface and well water samples, with NoV GII apparently not affected.

Yaksa stream joins Gongji stream before it reaches Uiam Lake, which is a drinking water source for the city. Limited data exists on the Yaksa stream water quality. Therefore, water quality parameters (pH, electrical conductivity (EC), biological oxygen demand (BOD), total nitrogen (T-N), total phosphorous (T-P), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), total coliforms, and Escherichia coli (E. coli) concentration) were sampled from Gongji (at sites GJ1 and GJ2) and Yaksa (at sites YS1 and YS2) streams from May to September, 2022. The results revealed the overall water quality of both streams was good (BOD = 0.27-3.66 mg/L; TP = 0.003-0.074 mg/L), except on August 3. On August 3, the concentrations of BOD, TP, total coliforms, and E. coli were elevated, with the highest concentrations in samples from GJ2. The recent heavy rainfall potentially caused sewage inflows near GJ2. The correlation analysis revealed positive linear relationships in the 1-day cumulative precipitation with BOD (r = 0.503), total coliforms (r = 0.547), and TP (r = 0.814). The Yaksa stream may be an Anabaena sp. source, which contaminated samples from YS1, YS2, and GJ2, but not at GJ1 (upstream of the tributary).

Physicochemical Mechanisms of Dissolved 137Cs Seasonal Variations in Freshwaters: Fukushima and Chernobyl	RADIOCHEMISTRY												Analysis of available monitoring data sets on concentrations of accidentally derived dissolved radiocesium in water bodies is indicative of two major physicochemical mechanisms responsible for their seasonal variations in water bodies in the course of the year: temperature dependence of radiocesium desorption from suspended material and ion-exchange remobilization of radiocesium by ammonium cations formed during decomposition of organic matter in anoxic conditions. An equation describing seasonal variations in concentration of dissolved radiocesium in water bodies has been derived accounting for two factors: water temperature, and combined concentration of key competing cations.																			1066-3622	1608-3288				DEC	2023	65	6					708	714		10.1134/S1066362223060127	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1066362223060127													WOS:001165111000008

Ice and Snow Thickness of the IGAN Glacier in the Polar Urals from Ground-Based Radio-Echo Sounding in 2019 and 2021	WATER RESOURCES												Small glaciers of the Polar Urals are at the limits of their existence. Their state and changes serve as an important natural indicator of modern climatic changes. In 2019 and 2021, we performed ground-based radar studies of one of these glaciers, the IGAN Glacier, to measure ice thickness and snow cover. We used Picor-Led (1600 MHz), and VIRL-7 (20 MHz) GPRs. According to these data, the glacier has an average thickness of 49 m, maximum 113 m. The glacier has a polythermal structure: a cold ice layer with an average thickness of 12 m (maximum 43 m), overlaps the temperate ice with an average thickness of 37 m (maximum 114 m in the upper part of the glacier). The volume of ice contained in the glacier (in its studied part) is 14.3 x 106 m(3), of which 10.89 x 106 m(3) is temperate ice and 3.44 x 10(6) m(3) is cold ice. For comparison: according to the radar data of 1968, the total ice thickness then reached 150 m in the central part, and the thickness of the upper layer of cold ice was 40-50 m. Radar snow measurement survey allowed us to plot the distribution of seasonal snow thickness over the glacier surface in 2019 and 2021, where a general spatial pattern of snow thickness increase from 2 m on the glacier terminus to 8 m and more towards the back wall of the cirque which is due to the significant influence of avalanche nourishment and wind transport. Over the last decade, the glacier has lost about 3.2 x 106 m(3) of ice, and if the rate of loss continues, it may disappear in 40-50 years. However, this process may have a non-linear character, as it involves not only climatic factors, but also local terrain features, on the one hand contributing to a high accumulation of snow, on the other hand - to the formation of a glacial lake during glacier retreat, which may intensify ablation.

Toward Improved Short-Term Forecasting for Lake Victoria Basin. Part I: A Radar-Based Convective Mode Analysis	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												East African countries benefit economically from the largest freshwater lake in Africa: Lake Victoria (LV). Around 30 million people live along its coastline, and 5.4 million people subsist on its fishing industry. However, more than 1000 fishermen die annually by high-wave conditions often produced by severe convective wind phenomena, which marks this lake one of the deadliest places in the world for hazardous weather impacts. The World Meteorological Organization launched the 3-yr High Impact Weather Lake System (HIGHWAY) project, with the main objective to reduce loss of lives and eco-nomic goods in the lake basin and improve the resilience of the local communities. The project conducted a field campaign in 2019 aiming to provide forecasters with high-resolution observations and to study the storm life cycle over the lake basin. The research discussed here used the S-band polarimetric Tanzania radar from the field campaign to investigate the diurnal cycle of the convective mode over the lake. We classified the lake storms occurring during the two wet seasons into six different con-vective modes and present their diurnal evolution, organization, and main radar-based attributes, thereby extending the knowl-edge of convection on the lake. The result is the creation of a "convection catalog for Lake Victoria," using the operational forecast lake sectors, and defining the exact times for the different timeslots resulting from the HIGHWAY project for the ma-rine forecast. This will inform methods to improve the marine operational forecasts for Lake Victoria, and to provide the basis for new standard operation procedures (SOP) for severe weather surveillance and warning.

Totally, four digenean species (Clinostomum complanatum, Tylo-delphys clavata, Posthodiplostomum sp. and Ichthyocotylurus sp.), one nematode species (Rhabdochona denudata), one monogenean species (Dactylogyrus nanus) and two myxosporean species (Myxobolus sp. 1 and Myxobolus sp. 2) were identified. Overall infection prevalence, mean intensity and mean abundance were 87.0%, 22.1 +/- 2.5, 16.2 +/- 2.0, respectively. Myxobolus sp. 2 was the most prevalent parasite species, followed by Myxobolus sp. 1 and C. complanatum. Dactylogyrus nanus was the most abundant parasite species, followed by C. complanatum and Ichthyocotylurus sp. The species Thylodelphys clavata, Postho-diplostomum sp., Ichthyocotylurus sp., Myxobolus sp. 1 and Myxobolus sp. 2 are new parasite records for S. cephalus as well as new geographical records in Turkiye.

The catchment of the Obrzyca River (a source of drinking water) is seasonally exposed to harmful cyanobacterial bloom. Previous studies (2008-2012; 2019) revealed that the most polluted water of the Obrzyca River was Uscie, close to the outlet of Rudno Lake (at the sampling point). Therefore, the effect on this lake was specifically examined in this study. Sampling was performed from May to September at that site and from July to September 2020 at Rudno Lake. The conducted analysis revealed a massive growth of Aphanizomenon gracile, especially in Rudno Lake. The results showed not only the distinct impact of cyanobacterial bloom on phytoplankton biodiversity but also the presence of microcystins and other cyanopeptides in both sampling points. The maximal total concentration of microcystins (dmMC-RR, MC-RR, dmMC-LR, MC-LR, MC-LY, MC-YR) equaled 57.3 mu g/L and the presence of cyanopeptides (aeruginosin, anabaenopeptin) was originally determined in Rudno Lake, August 2021. The presence of these toxins was highlighted in our results for the first time. The same samples from the lake were the most toxic in biotoxicological investigations using the planarian Dugesia tigrina. The performed bioassays proved that D. tigrina is a sensitive bioindicator for cyanotoxins. The physical and chemical indicators of water quality, i.e., color, temperature, total suspended solids, and total nitrogen and phosphorus, showed a significant correlation among each other and towards cyanobacterial abundance and microcystin concentrations.

MORPHODYNAMICS OF GLACIOVOLCANIC CAVES - MOUNT RAINIER, WASHINGTON, USA	JOURNAL OF CAVE AND KARST STUDIES												The twin summit craters of Mount Rainier, Washington, USA host the largest known glaciovolcanic caves in the world and at 4382 m, the highest elevation caves in the USA. The caves are formed in ice at the glacier-rock interface by volcanogenic gases and atmospheric advection. However, the way in which discrete caves are formed and evolve remains poorly understood. Surveys of the cave systems in 1970-1973 and 1997-1998 in both the West and East Craters documented cave passage morphology. Field expeditions from 2014-2017 comprehensively surveyed the Rainier summit caves and undertook thermal imaging and temperature monitoring. Significant changes had occurred. In the East Crater, documented cave length has nearly doubled since 1973 to 3593 m of passage spanning 144 m of depth, revealing a new subglacial lake, and now nearly circumnavigating the East Crater. Of the reported increase in length, some 600 m of the mapped passage is possibly newly formed. Across 47 years of observation, certain sections of the cave appear to be preserved in form and position through time, while others are more actively being lost or forming. Conserved passages are generally sub-horizontal, passages following the curvilinear crater contours, show low temperature variability, and are dependent on perennial fumarolic activity or distributed heat flux emanating from warm bedrock and sediment floors. Transient passages are smaller diameter dendritic passages following the slope of the ice-rock interface towards entrance zones and normal to the circum-crater passage. They also show higher variability in temperature and airflow and are subject to seasonal weather and mechanical collapse, which may contribute to transience. Additional research is required to confirm the mechanisms maintaining conserved passages and formation of transient passages.

J	Sultan, K; Faraj, TK; Zaman, QU				Sultan, Khawar; Faraj, Turki Kh.; Zaman, Qamar uz			Ferric Oxyhydroxylsulfate Precipitation Improves Water Quality in an Acid Mining Lake: A Hydrogeochemical Investigation	WATER												Hydrogeochemistry of a lignite pit lake in Lusatia, Germany, was investigated. Anoxic groundwater from the dump aquifer rich in Fe-II (average similar to 5911 similar to mol/L) and SO4 (average similar to 14,479 similar to mol/L) contents enter the lake as subsurface inflow; oxidation and subsequent precipitation of poorly crystallized Fe-oxyhydroxysulfate (schwertmannite) occurs and causes acidification (pH similar to 2.8). However, the removal of dissolved loads as solid phases significantly improves the groundwater quality of the downgradient as an outflow. The rainwater isotopic values (delta D similar to 8.88% and delta O-18 similar to 65.86%) closely matched with the groundwater showing very little isotopic modification, which points to a short residence time of groundwater. The displacement of delta D and delta O-18 values (slope = 5.3) from the meteoric water line reflected the evaporative enrichment of the lake water. The isotopic signature also revealed longer residence times of epilimnion than the hypolimnion waters which are dominated by groundwater. The lake is dimictic and showed abrupt changes in physicochemical parameters along the interface (similar to 0.30 m thick) when separating the epilimnion (upper 4 m) from the hypolimnion (bottom 1.5 m). Lake sediments were found to be dominated by clay size fraction occurring as laminations (thickness: 1 similar to 0.5 mm) that reflect seasonal sedimentation. Higher schwertmannite formation in the south as compared to the north (recharge side) also serves as a scavenger of potentially toxic elements which is probably a natural solution to man-made problems. Schwertmannite transformation to goethite releases sulfate which is reduced and fixed as secondary sulfide minerals over time. Overall, waters are of a Ca-SO4 to Ca-Mg-SO4 type with distinct inflow (Fe-II/Fe-III > 2.5) and outflow (Fe-II/Fe-III < 0.5) of groundwater.

J	Sudo, Y; Hurst, AW				Sudo, Y; Hurst, AW			Temperature changes at depths to 150 metres near the active crater of Aso Volcano: preliminary analysis of seasonal and volcanic effects	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Two holes were drilled to depths of 150 m and 70 m from the surface about 200 m from the active crater of Aso Volcano and quartz thermometers were installed in the holes at depth intervals of 30 m and 35 m, respectively. This series of observations is one of the first measurements of temperature at depth so close to an active crater. The ground temperature at a depth of 2 m had an annual variation with a range of about 10 degrees C, as expected, clearly corresponding to the atmospheric temperature variation, but delayed by about 1 month. Temperatures measured at depths from 30 m to 70 m had very small annual temperature variations. The range of temperature at 30 m depth was about 0.04 degrees C. The temperature at a depth of 60 m, however, was particularly stable, probably because at this depth the hole is in the middle of a massive lava flow. At depths of 70 m or more, small (less than 0.2 degrees C) annual temperature variations were again observed. These variations are probably due to the effects of surface water descending to these levels through cracks and fissures. At 120 m depth, the average temperature is about 17.5 degrees C, over 5 degrees C above the surface average temperature, and the annual temperature variation has a range of about 2 degrees C, out of phase with the atmospheric changes. This is probably due to the interaction of rainfall descending from the surface with convecting hotter fluids from below. The temperature gradient below 100 m depth is very high, with the average temperature at a depth of 150 m being about 31 degrees C. The temperature variations at this depth are dominated by long-period variations, with a steady decline after a peak in November-December 1989, overlain by a rather irregular seasonal variation, with a range of about 0.5 degrees C. October 1989 was the time of most active volcanic activity, with Strombolian eruptions depositing ash to a distance of 50 km from the crater, accompanied by very high amplitude volcanic tremor. So the temperature changes at 150 m seem to be mainly the result of volcanic activity. The maximum temperature at this depth occurred 1 or 2 months after the peak of observed volcanic activity. So it is likely that the temperature variations show a delayed influence of the level of volcanic activity. These results show that in the unconsolidated materials often found by active volcanic craters, the effects of seasonal atmospheric variations are carried to substantial depths by groundwater flows, so that at Aso Volcano, only at the maximum depth of 150 m are the temperature variations clearly dominated by the level of volcanic activity.

J	GLIWICZ, ZM				GLIWICZ, ZM			DAPHNIA GROWTH AT DIFFERENT CONCENTRATIONS OF BLUE-GREEN FILAMENTS	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Body growth rates in four Daphnia species (D. magna, D. pulicaria, D. hyalina and D. cucullata) decreased with increased concentration of of Aphanizomenon filaments when animals were grown in batch cultures at high Scenedesmus food levels (0.3-0.5 mg C/l) in an artificial medium adequate for Aphanizomenon at 20-degrees-C. Growth rates became negative in high filament concentrations. The maximum filament concentration that allowed for positive growth rate (the intercept of the regression line of the growth rate on filament concentration with the zero growth rate level) was greater in the small-bodied D. cucullata and D. hyalina than in the large-bodied D. magna and D. pulicaria, supporting the notion that smaller species are less vulnerable to interference from algal filaments. The critical filament concentration was higher when estimated in the artificial medium diluted by membrane-filtered lake water, in which filaments were more susceptible to grazing by Daphnia. No tendency for growth rate of Daphnia to decrease with increased filament concentration was observed in diluted medium at low Scenedesmus food levels (< 0.1 mg C/1). Different levels of readily available food, and different concentrations and physiological states of filaments in the field and experimental studies, may be among the reasons why cyanobacterial filaments do not always cause reduced assimilation and increased respiration in Daphnia, which otherwise may result in halting its growth and reproduction and eventually lead to its extinction.																			0003-9136					NOV	1990	120	1					51	65																WOS:A1990EQ24300004

A.; Kundel, Holly; Custer, Christopher A.; Mclaughlin, Paul; Wagner, Tyler			Accounting for spatiotemporal sampling variation in joint species distribution models	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												Estimating relative abundance is critical for informing conservation and management efforts and for making inferences about the effects of environmental change on populations. Freshwater fisheries span large geographic regions, occupy diverse habitats and consist of varying species assemblages. Monitoring schemes used to sample these diverse populations often result in populations being sampled at different times and under different environmental conditions. Varying sampling conditions can bias estimates of abundance when compared across time, location and species, and properly accounting for these biases is critical for making inferences.We develop a joint species distribution model (JSDM) that accounts for varying sampling conditions due to the environment and time of sampling when estimating relative abundance. The novelty of our JSDM is that we explicitly model sampling effort as the product of known quantities based on time and gear type and an unknown functional relationship to capture seasonal variation in species life history.We use the model to study relative abundance of six freshwater fish species across the state of Minnesota, USA. Our model enables estimates of relative abundance to be compared both within and across species and lakes, and captures the inconsistent sampling present in the data. We discuss how gear type, water temperature and day of the year impact catchability for each species at the lake level and throughout a year. We compare our estimates of relative abundance to those obtained from a model that assumes constant catchability to highlight important differences within and across lakes and species.Synthesis and applications: Our method illustrates that assumptions relating indices of abundance to observed catch data can greatly impact model inferences derived from JSDMs. Specifically, not accounting for varying sampling conditions can bias inference of relative abundance, restricting our ability to detect responses to management interventions and environmental change. While our focus is on freshwater fisheries, this model architecture can be adopted to other systems where catchability may vary as a function of space, time and species.

Evaluation of soil reclamation techniques at the Key Lake uranium mine	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Adequate soil nutrients and water supply are critical to vegetation establishment and creation of sustainable ecosystems in post-disturbed mining sites. This study investigated effects of various amendments and capping techniques on soil quality and moisture distribution on a reclaimed waste rock pile at the Key Lake uranium mine in northern Saskatchewan, Canada. Soil profiles were reconstructed in 2010 using locally available sandy glacial materials to create soil covers of 1 m thickness. The reclamation treatments consisted of a Control plot, commercial peat (Peat), a local lake sediment (Sediment), underlying flax straw (Straw), mulched forest floor and Ae (LFH), fertilizer (NPK), manure pellets (Pellets), and a demonstration plot (Demo) comprised of Sediment, LFH and Pellets. Soil amendments were applied by various techniques as broadcast, surface incorporation, below the surface or surface mounding. Annual plot monitoring was conducted from 2011 to 2013 and soil samples were analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity (EC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), available nutrients, cation exchange capacity (CEC), total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and regulated metals. Volumetric moisture contents were measured periodically to examine soil moisture response to growing-season precipitation. In 2013, the topsoil of the Control plot was slightly acidic (pH of 6.3) while the Sediment and Demo plots had the lowest pH of 4.0. The EC and SAR values were below 1.0 in all treatment plots. The highest levels of available N, TN, TOC and CEC were in the Sediment and Demo plots, followed by the Peat. The concentration of arsenic exceeded the regulatory limit by 3.4- and 2.6-fold in the Sediment and Demo topsoil, respectively, while concentrations of other metals were below the limits in all treatment plots. The Sediment and Demo treatments were most effective in retaining water in the topsoil, while application of soil amendment by mounding enhanced infiltration and water transmission in the profile. In terms of soil fertility and moisture storage, the combination of organic amendments in multi-layers plus surface mounding, as in the Demo plot, is the most promising capping technique for restoring soil health, vegetative cover and ecosystem functions on the waste rock pile.																			0008-4271	1918-1841				MAY	2015	95	2					153	176		10.4141/CJSS-2014-084	http://dx.doi.org/10.4141/CJSS-2014-084													WOS:000355745500007

Paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic research has increasingly relied on the use of varved sediments to provide high-resolution geochronologies and climatic reconstructions. However, a special depositional environment is necessary for varve formation and preservation. Generally, varves can be found in the sediments of maar lakes because of their special geological and hydrological environment. The preliminary research showed that a few carbonate laminations are developed in the Huguangyan maar lake, south China. They are poorly developed and not annual laminations, and may be related to periodically drought. Diatomaceous laminations are found in the maar lakes in northeast China. Diatomaceous laminations with cyclic nature corresponding with seasonal diatom blooming are the credible natural clock.																			1001-6538	1861-9541				DEC	2000	45	24					2292	2295		10.1007/BF02886371	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02886371													WOS:000166309700017

Spatiotemporal variations of bacterial variables were a consequence of the seasonal evolution of the reservoir coupled with the resource availability. Multivariate regression analyses suggest that about 14 and 26% of the variance in bacterial standing stock and activity may be explained by the physical environment (i.e., temperature) and a resource availability index (chlorophyll a concentration or primary production), respectively. A carbon budget indicated that 4-126% (mean = 20%) of the ambient PP may be channeled through the microbial loop via bacterial biomass production. Heterotrophic bacterial production in the Sep Reservoir may therefore, on occasion, represent a significant source of carbon for higher order consumers.

J	POLE, M				POLE, M			EARLY MIOCENE FLORA OF THE MANUHERIKIA GROUP, NEW-ZEALAND .10. PALEOECOLOGY AND STRATIGRAPHY	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF NEW ZEALAND												A stratigraphic sequence of vegetation is recognised from macrofossil assemblages in Lower-Mid Miocene fluvial-lacustrine sediments of the Manuherikia Group, New Zealand. Temperature, water-level, drainage, fire and rainfall were probably the factors that divided the distribution of plant taxa into several distinct communities.These communities are compared with structural vegetation types presently recognised in eastern Australia, including notophyll vine forest (sometimes with podocarp conifers), microphyll forest, araucarian notophyll vine forest, tall open-forest (at times probably closed forest with sclerophyll emergents), notophyll feather palm vine forest, and fem fields. The earliest assemblage in the Cromwell region represents Nothofagus forest (microphyll fem forest or microphyll vine forest), or at least a forest in which Nothofagus was probably an important element. Rainfall was high, but the associated presence of Allocasuarina indicates forest edge conditions, or perhaps disturbance by fire, which removed the canopy long enough for this genus to have a temporary advantage. Temperature may have been-cooler than that required for subtropical rainforest, or alternatively, soil nutrients may have been low. The succeeding Araucarian zone may indicate lower rainfall (and probably war-mer conditions than when Nothofagus dominated the vegetation), allowing the araucarians to compete with the rainforest trees and the Allocasuarina to persist, but not low enough to result in a high frequency of fires. Vegetation was araucarian notophyll vine forest. The Eucalyptus zone suggests that rainfall continued to decrease, or become more seasonal, to the point at which the frequency of fires rose to at least once every 350 years, and a tall-open forest developed. The part of this zone in which Allocasuarina was absent may represent the peak frequency of fires, which were detrimental to Allocasuarina. A dramatic increase in rainfall and possibly soil-nutrients seems to have eliminated fire and caused the local replacement of Eucalyptus and Allocasuarina by a podocarp notophyll evergreen vine forest, including Elaeocarpaceae, Lauraceae, Myrtaceae, Podocarpaceae and, in areas of impeded drainage, palms. A return to drier conditions, or a large fire, heralded the regrowth of Eucalyptus - Allocasuarina woodland or open forest. Rainforest conditions are probably represented in the highest part of the sequence. At various times there were wide expanses of raised peat bog with a generally treeless cover. Climate was microthermal to mesothermial.

The lake contains annually laminated (varved) sediments that form a unique archive of past environmental variability. Regular measurements of the lake water physical and chemical characteristics were done using a multiparameter sonde and a set of temperature sensors deployed in the water column. Seasonal variability in sediment fluxes was documented by a sediment trap. Field sampling provided information about the hydrochemistry of incoming streams and of the lake outflow. The overall monitoring program was designed to assess relationships among meteorological conditions, limnological processes, and modern sedimentation and to answer the question of whether meteorological and limnological phenomena can be precisely tracked with varves. However, this dataset can also be used for modeling physical and biogeochemical processes in lakes. The dataset is archived at 10.34808/w8w7-9x34 (Tylmann et al., 2023).

Congruence of water column, contemporary and pre-industrial sediment cladoceran assemblages in 85 Canadian lakes of contrasting human impact levels	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Crustacean zooplankton occupy a key position as primary consumers within lake food webs, acting as early indicators of wider ecosystem shifts that can cascade to higher trophic levels. Their communities can be assessed via water column net hauls or via sediment samples containing preserved subfossil remnants from various time periods; the latter probably integrate multiple years of data, habitats within lakes, and seasonal patterns. The degree to which such samples do or do not correspond has never been assessed across a wide variety of lake types and gradients.As part of a larger sampling of over 600 lakes across lake-rich Canada, 85 lakes were selected along a gradient of human impact, according to contemporary catchment land use, to analyse cladoceran zooplankton assemblage relatedness among snapshot water column, contemporary and pre-industrial sediment samples.We used a combination of ordinations and matrix correlations (RV coefficients), along with partial redundancy analyses, to determine the degree to which the different sample types were comparable and whether they responded similarly to >30 environmental variables. We also compared conclusions obtained using the full cladoceran assemblages versus pelagic-only taxa and whether our results varied according to degree of human impact.Overall, while all sample types were correlated, congruence was highest between contemporary and pre-industrial sediment sample types. This result could arise from the under-representation of littoral taxa in water column samples relative to those from the sediment. In high impacted catchments, however, we observed greater similarity between water column and contemporary sediment samples, as water quality stressors potentially structure assemblages in parallel directions over time. In these modern-day sample types and among measured variables, we identified lake depth and pH as the most important structuring variables across Canada.In this first study comparing cladoceran assemblages in water column, contemporary and pre-industrial sediments across many lakes, we conclude that water column and sediment samples respond similarly to environmental drivers but should not be considered entirely analogous or redundant.					; Beisner, Beatrix/ABG-7855-2020; Gregory-Eaves, Irene/U-9325-2019; Paquette, Cindy/ABB-4933-2021	Paquette, Cindy/0000-0002-2909-2485; Gregory-Eaves, Irene/0000-0002-0380-5061; Beisner, Beatrix/0000-0001-6972-6887													0046-5070	1365-2427				FEB	2024	69	2					193	211		10.1111/fwb.14202	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.14202		NOV 2023											WOS:001107457700001

PATTERNS OF OCCURRENCE IN THE UPLAND FORESTS OF SOUTHWESTERN VIRGINIA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												A comparative ecological study of the Myxomycetes occurring in five different upland forest communities in the Mountain Lake area of southwestern Virginia was carried out during 1982-9186. Although the forest communities selected for study occupied different relative positions (from subxeric to mesic) with respect to an environmental moisture complex-gradient, a high degree of similarity existed among the communities for species composition of Myxomycetes. However, absolute abundance, species richness, and species diversity were higher for the more mesic communities. The seasonal pattern was for both species richness and species diversity to be exceedingly low early in the season, to increase to their highest levels in August, and then to decline throughout the remainder of the season. In general, Myxomycetes appear to be rather opportunistic organisms, occupying those microhabitats suitable for their growth and development as these become available to them. Nevertheless, considerable resource partitioning among species would seem to exist, since characteristic patterns of microhabitat occupation and sporulation phenology were noted for most species. In an effort to quantify resource partitioning, values of nich breadth and niche overlap were calculated for 39 quantitatively important species.																			0008-4026					NOV	1988	66	11					2187	2207		10.1139/b88-302	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b88-302													WOS:A1988Q942100014
J	HAMILTON, SK; LEWIS, WM				HAMILTON, SK; LEWIS, WM			CAUSES OF SEASONALITY IN THE CHEMISTRY OF A LAKE ON THE ORINOCO RIVER FLOODPLAIN, VENEZUELA	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Lake Tineo, which lies on the Orinoco floodplain, passes through four seasonal phases (filling, through-flow, drainage, and isolation), during which the lake volume changes 20-fold. During filling and through-flow, when the lake is inundated by river water, floating grasses (Pasplalum repens) and phytoplankton grow rapidly, causing depletion of inorganic N and P between inflow and outflow, although phytoplankton biomass does not accumulate because of flushing. Inundation of the surrounding forest has no quantifiable effects on concentrations of major ions or macronutrients. Following through-flow, phytoplankton biomassaccumulates, and high abundances of blue-green algae increase N in the lake by fixation (15 kg ha-1). Quantities of some elements released by decomposition of floating grasses over a 4-week period are very high in relation to lake-water inventories (K, 126%; Cl, 66%; organic C, 170%; N, 74%; and P, 89%). Mass balance for Lake Tineo shows, on an annual basis, net retention of N (27%).sbd.partly because most nitrogen fixation is limited to the isolation phase.sbd.and P (39%), and net yield of inorganic C (24%). There is neither detectable net retention nor yield of organic C, major cations, sulfate, or chloride.

Solms-Loubach, Salvinia rotundifolia Willd., Lemna gibba L. and Ricciocarpos natans (L.) Corda) of a shallow lake from Entre Rios province, Argentina (33 degrees 48'S, 58 degrees 57'W), permanently connected to the Parana river. In total, 136 algal taxa were identified: 57 Bacillariophyceae, 31 Chlorophyta, 31 Cyanophyceae, 13 Tribophyceae and 4 Euglenophyceae, all of them characterized by wide geographic distributions. Infertile filaments of Oedogonium spp., Zygnema spp., Spirogyra spp, and Mougeotia spp. (Chlorophyta) dominated the assemblages throughout the year. The diatoms Eunotia bilunaris var, bilunaris, E. monodon var. monodon and two varieties of Gomphonema augur reached high relative frequencies. Characiopsis ettliana and Ch. fair var. cecoalensis (Tribophyceae) were consistently present in low numbers. Multivariate analyses did not reveal major compositional dissimilarities between the four substrates surveyed. Seasonal changes in the community composition were chiefly due to the presence of thychoepiphytic species in association with the interchange of river and lake waters. It is concluded that the pattern of seasonal succession is governed by a complex interaction between hydrometric and seasonal changes.																			0018-8158					OCT 9	1996	333	2					111	120		10.1007/BF00017573	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00017573													WOS:A1996VR64000005

Transport of agricultural Pb, As and P through a riparian wetland	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												A 100-y geochemical record preserved in the sediments of a Mississippi oxbow lake yields evidence that chemicals entering from agricultural fields are only temporarily sequestered in the riparian fringe prior to active removal and transport to open water. Elevated concentrations of Pb and As, corresponding to peak historical use of lead arsenate pesticide, are clearly identified in open water sediment cores, but are absent in cores from the riparian fringe; P concentrations are also significantly higher in the open water cores than in the riparian fringe. A conceptual model is proposed where elements initially deposited in the riparian zone are seasonally remobilized by release from decomposing litter, and through uptake by wetland trees that return elements to the litter through leaf senescence. Within the riparian zone, seasonal remobilization eventually diffuses or eliminates the historical record. Elements that reach and settle out in the open water environment are sequestered and an historical geochemical record is preserved.																			0003-0031	1938-4238				APR	2008	159	2					457	467		10.1674/0003-0031(2008)159[457:TOAPAA]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1674/0003-0031(2008)159[457:TOAPAA]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000254844300018

The dam reservoir and the El Haouareb aquifer are hydraulically connected and they jointly recharge the Kairouan alluvial aquifer downstream. This water transfer is complex and shows a considerable heterogeneity in space and time. We exploited hydrodynamic and geochemical information.

This paper analyzes the vulnerability of riverine communities to extreme high and low waters around the Lago Janauaca near Manaus, in a context of intensification of the hydrological cycle. We shall first try to characterize the hydrological variability of Rio Solimoes and its spatial impact on the Lago. Important though is the extension of the natural phenomenon, human dynamics on the banks of the lake must be also taken into consideration. Such dynamics are due to the opening of dirt roads linking the lake to the BR319, rather than to the moderate expansion of traditional crops. Finally, interviews with inhabitants reveal a complex relationship between the various activities and hydrological extremes. Droughts appear to be the major disturbances, not only because of their impact on crops, but mostly because of the difficulties they imply for local and regional mobilities.

Constructed wetlands in the riparian zone can decontaminate certain organic pollutants and nutrients in surface runoff effectively. The integrated constructed wetland of Maliao River, at the north bank of Fuxian Lake, Yunnan province, is selected as the studied area. The removal efficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus of different function units of the wetland has been studied. Results show that, nitrogen removal efficiency in the sedimentation tank (ST) unit is not apparent, where the mineralization of organic nitrogen to NH4+ may happen. But the subsurface flow unit (SSF) and the free water surface (FWS) unit with macrophytes have noticeable effect on nitrogen removal. The removal efficiencies of NH4+, NO3- and TN are 18.0%, 19.7% and 22.6% respectively for SSF, and are 50.4%, 35.9% and 43.5% for FWS. In the ST unit phosphorus retention happens, which is more apparent for higher pollutant input concentrations, with an average retention rate of 14.9%. The removal effects of phosphorus in the SSF and FWS units are not noticeable, probably due to the saturation of soil adsorption after more than two years operating for the FWS unit. Rainfall has evident effect on the removal efficiency of phosphorus in the SSF unit. In wet seasons, there happens particle phosphorus adsorption and deposition with a removal efficiency of 12.1%. Under the anaerobic condition resulting from small discharge rates at the end of wet seasons, phosphorus may be released from the wetland soil.					deng, lin/KSM-4783-2024														1018-4619	1610-2304					2011	20	10A					2756	2763																WOS:000296690500016

The pattern of seasonal changes in the concentration of APP was similar to that of total nitrogen and total phosphorus. Phylogenetic analyses as inferred from the partial 16S rRNA gene sequences showed great diversity of the picocyanobacterial community in Lake Erhai, which comprised both previously identified (less abundant) and unique clusters (more abundant). Group B and Lake Erhai cluster 4 (LE-4) were ubiquitous in Lake Erhai picocyanobacterial community.

In this study, multiple data sources, including remotely sensed surface soil moisture retrieved from the European Remote Sensing Satellite-1/2 scatterometer (SCAT), soil moisture simulated by the VIP (Vegetation Interface Processes) eco-hydrological dynamical model, and in situ soil profile measurements were employed to assess root zone soil moisture over the Baiyang Lake Basin, north China. Correlation coefficients between the SCAT surface soil moisture dataset and VIP simulation in four seasons varied from 0.47 to 0.66 (p <0.01). General agreement among remotely sensed retrieval, the eco-hydrological model prediction and in situ measurements shows the potential of the scatterometer for routine acquirement of surface soil moisture patterns in the study area. In addition, the overall agreement between VIP predicted root-layer soil moisture and in situ measurements confirms the reliability of using the VIP model for root-layer soil moisture monitoring at seasonal scales.					; Qiu, Jianxiu/O-6255-2016	Liu, Suxia/0000-0003-4546-4960; Qiu, Jianxiu/0000-0002-1275-4171													0144-7815		978-1-907161-18-6				2011	343						118	+																WOS:000298024900019
J	Paynter, S; Nachabe, M; Yanev, G				Paynter, Shayne; Nachabe, Mahmood; Yanev, George			Statistical Changes of Lake Stages in Two Rapidly Urbanizing Watersheds	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Understanding changes induced by watershed urbanization is integral to developing an effective long-term management strategy. In this research, the authors study statistical changes of lake water surface levels in two urbanizing watersheds by evaluating serial change in time series parameters, autocorrelation, and variance as well as by developing a regression model to estimate weekly lake level fluctuations. The authors fit a seasonal integrated autoregressive moving average model to lake levels over subperiods of the data record to identify trends in parameter values. The authors fit the regression model with rainfall, lake stage, and temperature components for pre-urbanized and urbanized time periods to identify changes in baseflow. The lakes were located in Pasco County, Florida, USA and have not been significantly influenced by changes in rainfall patterns, pumping, surface water extraction or physical modification. Furthermore, the lakes exhibit consistent watershed urbanization and have sufficiently long and complete records. Based upon the research, the authors reach the following general conclusions about lakes in urbanizing watersheds: (1) the statistical structure of lake level time series is systematically altered, (2) in the absence of other forcing mechanisms, autocorrelation and baseflow decrease, (3) the presence of wetlands adjacent to lakes can offset the reduction in baseflow. These conclusions can be applied globally to similar regions that consist of lakes undergoing urbanization in flat, humid, shallow water table environments with wetlands. Furthermore, the methodology utilized can be applied at lakes in both similar and dissimilar environments to those studied in this research.

Some tests were performed in the water at four different points along the length of the pond in February and June 2010, the period of the low and high level of lake water respectively (period for seasonal phenomenon that is influenced by the region's natural Amazon) and analyzed the following parameters: pH, alkalinity, turbidity, color, hardness, dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and fecal coliforms. The values obtained in different periods were compared with the aim of identifying and evaluating the variables that affect water quality in these periods considering the seasonality in the volume of pond water. The parameters alkalinity, turbidity, color and hardness showed lower values during the high water of the pond. The pH tended to neutrality in both periods. For the biological parameters, the values diverged, with no variation for BOD, COD had higher values in the period of high water. And the OD showed lower values in the period of high water. Fecal coliform was the parameter that indicated a greater change in water quality due to domestic and industrial effluents that are released into the pond without proper treatment. The study showed that despite the human contribution, the pond still keeps its ability to dilute pollutants, mainly during the period of high water (flood).

Spatial and seasonal patterns in the crustacean zooplankton community of the St. Marys River	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Zooplankton communities of the Great Lakes have received significant attention in light of recent food web changes. No recent attempts have been made, however, to characterize the zooplankton community of the St. Marys River, the sole connecting channel between Lake Superior and Lake Huron. The purpose of this study was to provide new reference information for St. Marys River zooplankton communities and discuss the patterns observed in relation to recent changes in the Great Lakes. To address these objectives, sampling occurred at Lake Superior State University's Aquatic Research Laboratory from 2003 to 2007, and at 9 coastal wetlands in 2005. Compared to historical studies of St. Marys River riverine zooplankton, relative densities of calanoid copepods and daphnids have decreased while cyclopoid copepods and bosminids have increased. Coastal wetland communities continue to be diverse and exhibit similar community structure to previous studies, although Leptodora kindti, historically an abundant nearshore taxa, is now absent. Mechanisms driving differences in present community structure as compared to that noted in past studies of the St. Marys River are unknown but may be explained by the presence of the predatory, invasive zooplankton, Bythotrephes longimanus, local environmental variables, or changes upstream in Lake Superior. Temperature-zooplankton abundance patterns and nearshore community structure of Lake Superior are reflected in the St. Marys zooplankton community: thus, local environmental factors including changes in planktivory and proximity to upstream feeder communities likely play an important role in structuring St. Marys River zooplankton communities seasonally and spatially.

J	Nourani, V; Sayyah-Fard, M; Zhang, YQ				Nourani, Vahid; Sayyah-Fard, Mina; Zhang, Yongqiang			Coupling uncertain patterns of climatic variables in estimating evaporation from open water bodies	STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT												Since the variables involved in changing evaporation rate interact with each other, the result of first-order Sensitivity Analysis (SA1) is imperfect to reveal the dynamics of this phenomenon. The main goal of this study was to reveal coupling patterns of climatic agents in forming evaporation. The Partial Deviations (PaD) method, based on Back-Propagation Artificial Neural Network (BPNN), was used to reveal these patterns. While non-derivative methods survey only first-order sensitivity values, PaD can investigate higher-order sensitivity values. In this way, Summing Squares of partial Derivations (SSD) revealed magnitude of interactions. Also, gradient surfaces statistically reflected information on evaporation changes. To achieve better results, Wavelet-based denoising method was used to remove high-frequency component of inputs. The new method was tested at two neighboring sites (Ahvaz and Isfahan) in Iran. By feeding denoised input to BPNN, the uncertainty of first/ second order PaD values was reduced highly at Ahvaz station by 47.76 and 28.68%. At Ahvaz station coupling between one day-lagged evaporation with air temperature and humidity with magnitudes of 26.37 and 25.21%, respectively, had a major effect on the evaporation gradient. Similarly, the major effects on evaporation rate at Isfahan station belonged to coupling one day-lagged evaporation with air temperature and wind speed with magnitudes of 36.97 and 18.98%, respectively. The interaction patterns showed that rate of evaporation reversed for both stations in warm seasons because of an increase in atmospheric humidity. It seems cities near sea, despite having warm climate, show complex patterns of evaporation. Temperature, one-day-lagged evaporation, wind speed, and radiation aroused effect of other variables. The interaction of these variables caused an inverse rate of evaporation in some cases where the role of one day-lagged evaporation, as the ambient humidity memory, was more prominent than the rest.

The relationship is given by the expression y = 0.152 (+/- 0.023) + 0.145 (+/- 0.005) x. There is no statistically significant difference among the regression equations obtained during different periods of the year (t(0.001) and t(0.05) test for intercepts and slopes). Therefore, the relationship is independent of seasonality and can be used to predict the size of prey that can be captured by the different-sized Leptodora found at different phases of population growth.

The RCM used is the National Center for Atmospheric Research/Pennsylvania State University mesoscale model (MM4). Output from two year-round simulations (1983 and 1988) over the western United States is used to drive a lake model for Pyramid Lake in Nevada and a streamflow model for Steamboat Creek in Oregon. Comparisons with observed data indicate that MM4 is able to produce meteorologic data sets that can be used to drive hydrologic models. Results from the lake model simulations indicate that the use of MM4 output produces reasonably good predictions of surface temperature and evaporation. Results from the streamflow simulations indicate that the use of MM4 output results in good simulations of the seasonal cycle of streamflow, but deficiencies in simulated wintertime precipitation resulted in underestimates of streamflow and soil moisture. Further work with climate (multiyear) simulations is necessary to achieve a complete analysis, but the results from this study indicate that coupling of LSHMs and RCMs may be a useful approach for evaluating the effects of climate change on hydrologic systems.

The research on shallow water delta deposition models and depositional genesis is becoming more and more mature. In this latest discovery, a unique type of extremely narrow channel shallow water delta deposit was found at the top of the V oil group in the lower part of the Minghuazhen Formation during the Neogene period at DL-A Oilfield, located in the Bohai Bay Basin. The width of most single channels in this deposit measures between 100 and 200m, which is relatively rare and differs from existing research. To better understand this unique narrow channel shallow water delta deposit, a range of analysis methods were conducted including trace element analysis, major element analysis, grain size analysis, core observation, casting thin section observation, 3D seismic analysis, and other methods. These analyses were used to determine the sedimentary environment and sedimentary genesis of the deposit in the study area. The results show the following: (1) The top of the V oil group in the lower part of Minghuazhen Formation was deposited with a strong oxidizing environment. In the early stage, the climate was dry and cold, and gradually changed to warm and humid in the late stage. (2) Due to the frequent exposure to the surface, obvious weathered surfaces and sedimentary discontinuities were observed on the cores; the particle size analysis shows that the lamina types developed in the study area are clastic-clay laminae and clay-clastic laminae, which are mostly developed in shallow lakes area. (3) Observations of cores and thin sections also indicated that the hydrodynamic conditions frequently changed in the study area, alternating between strong and weak hydrodynamic conditions in a short period due to the alternating occurrence of flood and dry periods during the rainy season. Weak hydrodynamic conditions and slow water flow result in insufficient undercutting and sidecutting of rivers. The alternating occurrence of flood periods and dry periods has led to the development of crevasse splays and frequent river channel diversions, resulting in the inability of long-term stable development of the river channel. Besides, the change of water level has also led to the rebuilding of the river. Therefore, the multiple effects led to the formation of an extremely narrow channel shallow water delta. The accuracy of the sedimentary model is verified by a comparative study of the Shaliu River and Buha River in the modern Qinghai Lake. The new extremely narrow channels deposition model proposed this time further improves the deposition theory. At the same time, the modern depositional characteristics of the Shaliu River and Buha River also reveal the reservoir deposition between channels that cannot be distinguished by seismic data, providing guidance for the development of oil and gas in the study area.

J	Faimon, J; Nehyba, S				Faimon, J; Nehyba, S			The formation of spherical clay balls on the slopes of sandpit quarry, the Rudice-Sec (Czech Republic)	CATENA												Clays on the steep slopes of a small artificial sedimentary basin (sandpit quarry) alternately desiccate/crack and erode during hot dry and rainy seasons, respectively. Small irregular blocks of clay (IBC) predefined by cracks are released by gully erosion. The IBCs are quickly transported to the slope base and then rolled down the basin bottom by runoff. Due to rotation about a randomly changing axis and under an effect of deformation forces, the IBCs are transformed into spherical clay balls (SCB). The SCBs Eire transported, in general, towards the depositional base where they are buried by assorted sandy/clayey sediment. As soon as the kinetic energy of the runoff has decreased, the SCBs remain spread along transport path. From their distribution, the shaping process was evaluated. Based on data processing, the dependency, Psi = 1 - (1 - Psi(0))10(-8.9x10-5lambda/def), relating the clay ball projection sphericity, Psi, to the effective diameter, d(ef), and to the distance from the steep slope base, lambda, was found. Based on this equation, the length of clay ball transport can be estimated if the projection sphericity and effective diameter are known. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

They rely on seasonal monsoon rains that inundate rice fields and reconnect water bodies. Species assemblages vary over time and space, but infrastructure developments and climate change are negatively impacting the timing and magnitude of the flood pulse as well as fish migration routes and populations. In lowland rice field landscapes of Cambodia, community fish refuges (CFRs) are used to maintain fish abundance and biodiversity, with varying success. There is little knowledge of the drivers of this variation to guide management interventions. We used beta diversity to explore the effectiveness of 40 CFRs in maintaining species abundance and diversity during the dry seasons from 2012 to 2015. Results show CFR connectivity to the floodplain is important and suggest the type of inlet/outlet influences fish retention. CFRs connected to a large area of rice fields during the wet season had lower losses in species abundance through the dry season. However, large CFRs, or those part of a larger body of water, had higher losses in species abundance. Key design features of CFRs must be coupled with strong management capacity to guide the conservation and fisheries strategy in the Mekong Basin.					; Tilley, Alexander/P-2431-2019; Cagua, Edgar Fernando/J-3028-2014; Cagua, Edgar/J-3028-2014	Kura, Yumiko/0000-0002-1774-1943; Longobardi, Lorenzo/0000-0003-3126-7341; Freed, Sarah/0000-0001-8574-8218; Tilley, Alexander/0000-0002-6363-0945; sean, vichet/0009-0007-9881-078X; Cagua, Edgar Fernando/0000-0001-5867-3687; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2024	851	6					1475	1488		10.1007/s10750-023-05400-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-023-05400-6		NOV 2023											WOS:001097142000001

Triacylglycerol was the principle lipid energy reserve in all five species examined. During the height of the yearly Aphanizomenon flos-aquae bloom, lipid levels of the principle herbivores (Daphnia pulex and Leptodiaptomus sicilis) and an omnivore (Diacyclops bicuspidatus thomasi), were at their lowest concentration, suggesting that this cyanobacterium is nutritionally inadequate. As the cyanobacterial bloom began to collapse, bacterial numbers increased rapidly. The increase in bacterial numbers coincided with a large increase in areal lipid energy reserves of Diaphanosoma leuchtenbergianum and Chydorus sphaericus. Examination of seasonal patterns in the biomass of different algal species suggested that Rhodomonas minuta and Cryptomonas erosa played a key role in nutrition, lipid deposition, and reproduction of D. pulex and L. sicilis.

J	MADENJIAN, CP; CARPENTER, SR				MADENJIAN, CP; CARPENTER, SR			INDIVIDUAL-BASED MODEL FOR GROWTH OF YOUNG-OF-THE-YEAR WALLEYE - A PIECE OF THE RECRUITMENT PUZZLE	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Young-of-the-year (YOY) walleye (Stizostedion vitreum vitreum) growth is a vital step in walleye recruitment. An individual-based model (IBM) was developed to describe the growth of YOY walleye in Oneida Lake (New York, USA) and Lake Mendota (Wisconsin, USA). In Oneida Lake the only prey species included in the model was yellow perch (Perca flavescens), whereas both yellow perch and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) were prey species in the model for Lake Mendota. IBM predictions for length frequencies of the YOY walleye population at the end of the growing season showed good agreement with observed length frequencies. A theoretical relationship was derived between the encounter rate, lambda, used in the IBM and the half-saturation constant, kappa, used in a type 11 functional response model. Estimates of kappa from the two models showed good agreement, thus corroborating the value of lambda-chosen for the IBM application to Oneida Lake. The mean length of the YOY walleye cohort and the percentage of larger (greater-than-or-equal-to 175 mm in total length) walleyes in the cohort at the end of the growing season were most sensitive to gross growth efficiency, bioenergetics parameters for maximum daily consumption by walleyes, and the ratio of prey length to predator length at which the prey is susceptible to predation. In Lake Mendota the vulnerability of bluegills to predation by YOY walleyes was especially important in determining the growth of walleyes during their first growing season. The IBM approach was valuable for modeling those stages of life history in which characteristics of the individual were critical in determining recruitment.

It is of good theoretical value to study seasonal water quality variation and driving factors in plateau lakes. This paper studied the variation of water quality parameters in different seasons and their relationship with land use and climate factors in Dianchi Lake, Yunnan Province from 2001 to 2019. The results show that the factors restricting water environment in different seasons are different, but basically close. The water quality parameters of multiple water quality monitoring stations in different seasons showed a decreasing or insignificant trend. In the rainy season, the temperature and precipitation were positively correlated with most water quality parameters, while the driving effect of climate factors was not significant in the dry season. Different land types have different effects on water quality indexes in different seasons. The water quality score was higher in the rainy season than in the dry season. The scores of water quality stations in the south and middle of Dianchi Lake are higher than those in the north. In this study, the relationship between climate, land, and water quality is established, which provides a way for the research of water quality parameters.

Spatial-temporal vector abundance and malaria transmission dynamics in Nchelenge and Lake Mweru islands, a region with a high burden of malaria in northern Zambia	MALARIA JOURNAL												Background Over a decade of vector control by indoor residual spraying (IRS) and long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) distribution on the mainland, and only LLINs on islands had a minimal impact on disease burden in Nchelenge district, northern Zambia. Anopheles funestus and Anopheles gambiae are vectors known only from the mainland. Understanding vector bionomics in the district is necessary for planning and targeting effective vector control. This study aimed to provide information on abundance, seasonality, and Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite infectivity of malaria vectors in Nchelenge, including islands.Methods Mosquitoes were collected in 192 CDC indoor light traps set in 56 households between January 2015 and January 2016. Morphological and molecular species identifications and P. falciparum circumsporoites by ELISA were performed. Mosquito counts and relative abundances from the islands and mainland were compared, and household factors associated with vector counts were determined.Results A total of 5888 anophelines were collected during the study. Of these, 5,704 were female Anopheles funestus sensu lato (s.l.) and 248 female An. gambiae s.l. The highest proportion of An. funestus (n = 4090) was from Chisenga Island and An. gambiae (n = 174) was from Kilwa Island. The highest estimated counts per trap for An. funestus s.l. were from Chisenga island, (89.9, p < 0.001) and from the dry season (78.6, p < 001). For An. gambiae the highest counts per trap were from Kilwa island (3.1, p < 0.001) and the rainy season (2.5, p = 0.007). The highest estimated annual entomological inoculation rate was from Chisenga Island with 91.62 ib/p/y followed by Kilwa Island with 29.77 ib/p/yr, and then Mainland with 19.97 ib/p/yr.Conclusions There was varied species abundance and malaria transmission risk across sites and seasons. The risk of malaria transmission was perennial and higher on the islands. The minimal impact of vector control efforts on the mainland was evident, but limited overall. Vector control intervention coverage with effective tools needs to be extended to the islands to effectively control malaria transmission in Nchelenge district.

J	JOHNSON, L				JOHNSON, L			LONG-TERM EXPERIMENTS ON THE STABILITY OF 2 FISH POPULATIONS IN PREVIOUSLY UNEXPLOITED ARCTIC LAKES	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Previous research indicated that fish populations in arctic lakes maintain a constant size distribution an abundance in the face of the environmental variability experienced over their recent history. Such stability was tested over 1 5 seasons in Little Nauyuk and Gavia lakes (Northwest Territories) which contained previously undisturbed populations of Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus). Initially, the length-frequency distribution of Arctic char in Little Nauyuk Lake was bell shaped, and in Gavia Lake, it could be described by a negative logarithmic expression. Initial sampling of Gavia Lake removed the largest fish, allowing a well-defined mode to develop (cf. Little Nauyuk Lake). In both lakes the modal value remained constant throughout the exploitation phase. When fishing ceased the populations returned to their original state without evident oscillation. The stable state of the dominant population is considered to be one of ''least dissipation''. It is hypothesized that ecosystem structure depends on countervailing forces, one tending to decelerate energy flow through the ecosystem and the second tending to accelerate it. For ecosystems to exist, the tendency to decelerate energy flow must dominate system behaviour over ecological time. An ecosystem is regarded as a hemeorhetic system, stability seeking through the stabilization of energy flows.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JAN	1994	51	1					209	225		10.1139/f94-023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f94-023													WOS:A1994NC19800023

Wilson's (1990) publication which presents an attempt to understand the development of terrestrial plant communities of New Zealand against twelve different explanations of Hutchinson's Paradox. I make a rough comparison between terrestrial and planktonic communities; then I briefly review Hutchinson's Paradox and some of the later relevant phytoplankton results. I summarize the relevance of the IDH in phytoplankton dynamics, assessing its strengths and weaknesses; and finally, try to project our conclusions to terrestrial plant communities; this concerns chiefly the need for appropriate spatial and temporal scaling.

The spatial distribution was evaluated using gill nets with multiple meshes, set in the littoral and open water (1, 2, and 5 m depths) and seine. The fishes were more concentrated in the shallow areas in the wet season, spreading to the open area in the dry season. Aquatic insects (30%), sediment (16%), detritus (11%), algae (11%), fish (8%), terrestrial insects (8%), plant tissue (5%), scales (2%), zooplankton (1.8%), and benthic crustaceans (0.5%) were the dietary items of the whole fish fauna. Insectivore, omnivore, and piscivore were the main feeding guilds. There were seasonal and ontogenetic variations in the diet of some species. The main insectivore was Astyanax bimaculatus and the piscivores were Cichla ocellaris (> 86 mm SL) and Rhamdia sp.; small specimens of C. ocellaris fed mainly on aquatic insects and on zooplankton and fish in smaller proportion. The omnivores were represented by Hypostomus sp., Geophagus brasiliensis, and Tilapia rendalli (25-137 mm SL) were basically planktivores (mainly phytoplanktivores) and limnetic dwellers . In general, food overlap values were low, being significantly higher in the wet season.																			0378-1844					NOV-DEC	1993	18	6					302	313																WOS:A1993MH20600006

A comprehensive method involving indexing and multivariate analyses was used. Geostatistical tools were employed to interpolate seasonal and spatial deviations in water quality, and nutrient and organic load distribution. Lake water nutrient index (NI) values were between 4.61 and 7.31, and 2.65 and 4.69 during pre- and post-monsoon seasons, respectively, indicating significant nutrient enrichment and eutrophic conditions. For both seasons, the estimated organic pollution index (OPI) showed class II contamination (contamination starting), with post-monsoon values being higher. The study shows clear signs of eutrophication and early organic pollution. Effective management plans and sustainable tourism practices may benefit the lake, by reducing contamination and protecting the integrity of its ecosystem.

We examined the effect of such factors on the prevalence of gastrointestinal helminths in North American river otters (Lontra canadensis) in Yellowstone Lake, Yellowstone National Park. Otters in this ecosystem have recently experienced a decline in their main prey, Yellowstone cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri), and have, in turn, increased consumption of alternative foods. Helminths were found in 13.2% of otter fecal samples. The dominant parasite was a Diphyllobothrium sp. (Diphyllobothrium ditremum or Diphyllobothrium dendriticum), a cestode acquired from cutthroat trout. Truttaedacnitis truttae and Contracaecum spp. nematodes were incidental parasites in otter feces, and acanthocephalan eggs were found in 1 sample. The prevalence of trout remains and a Diphyllobothrium sp. in otter feces was higher during the cutthroat trout spawning season. A Diphyllobothrium sp. was more prevalent in the feces of female otters. There was no relationship between annual declines in the frequency of trout in otter feces and prevalence of parasites. Helminth prevalence and species richness in Yellowstone otters was low and likely reflects low predator densities and few intermediate hosts. This is the first study reporting the helminth fauna of river otters in the Greater Yellowstone Area and confirms the otter as a definitive host for Diphyllobothrium sp. in this region.																			0022-3395	1937-2345				APR	2015	101	2					240	243		10.1645/14-546.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1645/14-546.1								25192057					WOS:000353138400014

Spatio-Temporal Distribution of Physico-Chemical Parameters and Chlorophyll-a in Chilika Lagoon, East Coast of India	INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES												Present study contains the current status of Chilika Lagoon water quality during pre-monsoon, monsoon and post monsoon seasons of the year 2012. Spatial and seasonal distributions of water quality parameters viz. WT, pH, Salinity, DO, TSM, Chl-a and inorganic nutrients (NO2-, NO3-, NH4+, SiO44-) were examined in this study. Twenty locations were selected covering all the ecological sectors of the lagoon. Study reveals significant spatio-temporal variation in water quality parameters. The pH of the lagoon was found to be slightly alkaline. DO concentration was controlled by photosynthetic activities of autotrophs. Results of one-way ANOVA indicated spatio-temporal variation in the nutrients especially NH4+ and SiO44- (p<0.01). Concentration of PO43- was found below the pollution limit for aquatic lives. Among the nutrients, SiO44- was the most influencing factor regulating phytoplankton production of the lagoon throughout the year. However, NH4+ was found as the second influencing factor for distribution of Chl-a.

We examined the relationship be-tween estimated cyanobacteria biomass and the frequency of respiratory-related hospital visits for residents living near Green Bay, Lake Michigan, Wisconsin during 2017-2019. Remote sensing data from the Cyanobacteria Assessment Network was used to approximate cyanobacteria exposure through creation of a metric for cyanobacteria chlorophyll-a (ChlBS). We obtained counts of hospital visits for asthma, wheezing, and allergic rhinitis from the Wisconsin Hospital Association for ZIP codes within a 3-mile radius of Green Bay. We analyzed weekly counts of hospital visits versus cyanobacteria, which was modelled as a continuous measure (ChlBS) or categorized according to World Health Organization's (WHO) alert levels using Poisson generalized linear models. Our data included 2743 individual hospital visits and 114 weeks of satellite derived cyanobacteria biomass indicator data. Peak values of ChlBS were observed between the months of June and October. Using the WHO alert levels, 60% of weeks were categorized as no risk, 19% as Vigilance Level, 15% as Alert Level 1, and 6% as Alert Level 2. In Poisson regression models adjusted for temperature, dewpoint, season, and year, there was no association between ChlBS and hospital visits (rate ratio [RR] [95% Confidence Interval (CI)] = 0.98 [0.77, 1.24]). There was also no consistent association between WHO alert level and hospital visits when adjusting for covariates (Vigilance Level: RR [95% CI] 0.88 [0.74, 1.05], Alert Level 1: 0.82 [0.67, 0.99], Alert Level 2: 0.98 [0.77, 1.24], compared to the reference no risk category). Our methodology and model provide a template for future studies that assess the association between cyanobacterial blooms and respiratory health.

Biogeography and conservation biology of Florida's Geolycosa wolf spiders: threatened spiders in endangered ecosystems	JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION												The state of Florida has a complex Biogeography which is the product of past sea level changes and associated ocean currents creating numerous inland sand ridge systems which are home to a unique biota adapted to the seasonally dry conditions found on these sandy uplands. Among these xeric-adapted taxa is a suite of wolf spider species in the genus Geolycosa. Geolycosa wolf spiders are habitat specialists and poor dispersers, and many taxa have ranges restricted to specific ridge systems. We found that the six Geolycosa species typical of Florida's scrubs and sandhills (G. escambiensis Wallace, G. ornatipes (Bryant), G. micanopy Wallace, G. patellonigra Wallace, G. hubbelli Wallace and G. xera McCrone) have current distributions that correlate with the historical biogeography of the state. There are species typical of the Lake Wales Ridge and associated ridges (G. xera and G. hubbelli), species found on the more coastal ridges (G. patellonigra and G. micanopy) and species whose ranges are divided by the Apalachicola River drainage (G. escambiensis and G. ornatipes). We also found that Geolycosa wolf spiders tend to occur in species pairs which use different microhabitats: those which burrow in areas covered in leaf litter, and those which use only barren sites. These latter species require habitat management plans that include burns, that maintain the habitat in an open condition.																			1366-638X					MAR	2000	4	1					11	21		10.1023/A:1009688519138	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1009688519138													WOS:000208369300003

Evaluation of preventative algaecide treatments for cyanobacterial resting cells in sediments of a central US lake	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Kinley-Baird CM, Smith EF, Calomeni AJ, McQueen AD, Gusler GO, Boyer M, Decker KN, Clyde GA. 2023. Evaluation of preventative algaecide treatments for cyanobacterial resting cells in sediments of a central US lake. Lake Reserv Manage. 39:340-355.Cyanobacteria can overwinter in sediments of aquatic systems as resting cells and contribute to harmful algal bloom (HAB) resurgences. We evaluated field-scale preventative algaecide treatments in April 2022 in terms of effectiveness for decreasing viability of cyanobacterial resting cells, with the goal of minimizing planktonic growth in season. Two consecutive treatments of a granular peroxide-based algaecide (GreenClean PRO) were applied (48h apart) in a Kansas, United States, lake. Treatments were applied to a 31.5ha treatment zone, separated from a 12.9ha control zone using a silt curtain. Treatment design was informed by laboratory algaecide efficacy experiments using site-collected samples. In-lake treatment performance was evaluated based on comparisons of planktonic cyanobacterial densities in the treatment and control zones measured every 2 weeks for 4months, then monthly for 2 additional months. Other lines of evidence included resting cell densities and recruitment viability in sediments 3 d after treatments were performed. For 9 of 11 sampling events from May to October, average planktonic cyanobacterial densities trended lower in the treatment zone than in the control zone (ranging from 6 to 97% lower). Declines in sediment cell density and recruitment of resting cells in laboratory assessments were not measurable 3 d after treatments were performed. Additional studies will be necessary to strengthen the database supporting use of this management strategy. However, there may be an opportunity to expand the model for how algaecides are used to manage HABs more effectively and efficiently in freshwater resources.

In this study, in order to investigate potential affiliated MP hazards, lake MP samples were collected from a typical subtropical freshwater lake system in China (Poyang Lake) during the dry season (here, you should show the specific months) to explore their potential toxic element (PTE) response (i.e., exposure to Cu, Pb, and Zn) respective to the ecological environment and resident phytoplankton. Results show that average MP abundance in surface water can reach up to 1800 items m-3, which higher in the Nanjishan Wetland National Nature Reserve (NWNNR) (1175 items m-3). Polyester (i.e., purified terephthalic acid [PTA]) and polyethylene (PE) were the main polymer types found in surface water, fiber was the main MP shape, and most of the MP particle sizes are greater than 100 mu m. Moreover, phytoplankton biomass was significantly higher in the NWNNR compared to Poyang Lake's retention basin and water channel. It indicated that MP pollutant status of Poyang Lake is mild; however, the ecological risks that MPs pose should not be ignored. The significant positive correlation between MPs and PTEs indicated that PTE absorption and desorption by MPs may cause potential ecological stress. Although we anticipate no direct link between ecotoxicity and phytoplankton, MPs may have indirect effects on phytoplankton through their regulatory effects on PTE levels in water.

Hydrodynamic and geomorphic controls on the morphology of an island ecosystem in the Vembanad Lake, west coast of India	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Textural characteristics of the surficial sediments around Perumbalam Island located within the Vembanad Lake, southwest coast of India, were studied on a seasonal basis to understand the geomorphic response of the region. Sediment grain size increased from the northern to southern end of the island, indicating a progressive sorting by tidal currents. In contrast, an increase in the clay and organic carbon content in the sediments of the northern part of region suggests that their distribution is controlled by the productivity of the overlying water column. The evolution of this island is believed to be due to fluvial inputs from Muvattupuzha River. The braid shape of the island is attributed to the high-energy flow along the wedge of the estuary facing the river mouth, which has resulted in a build up of land along the southern boundary. The intense accretion on the southeastern and western sides of the island observed through satellite imagery reveals the fluvial influence on the evolution and morphology of this coastal lagoon.

J	Betancourt, C; Suárez, R; Toledo, L				Betancourt, Carmen; Suarez, Roberto; Toledo, Liliana			Ionic variability and trophic characteristics of the Abreus reservoir, Cuba	LIMNETICA												The Abreus reservoir is located in the Cienfuegos province, in mid-southern Cuba. It was built in 1986 for irrigation purposes but at present it is also used for industrial purposes. It is affected by agricultural, human and industrial wastes. In order to investigate the ionic variation, a temporal series of main compounds taken from a database generated from 1987 to 2005 was used. The descriptive statistics, seasonal behavior, and the relationship among variables were evaluated, and a principal component analysis was performed for data reduction. Water was slightly saline and very hard, with a high correlation among variables, which allowed them to be grouped in a new variable called "mineralization". This new variable had a marked seasonal behavior with significant differences between two periods, from November to May, in which the water has a higher saline content and is influenced by evaporation, and from June to October, when the composition of the water is influenced by the rain. The values obtained for the seasonal indexes of the variables studied corroborate the significant differences in the mineralization between both periods. This information is considered relevant for better water management. To evaluate the trophic status, five sampling campaigns were carried out between 2008 and 2009, in which water transparency was measured using Secchi's Disc, as well as total phosphorous (P-T) concentration, total inorganic nitrogen (Ni-T), and chlorophyll a. In spite of the high values of hardness. P-T registered high values, classifying the reservoir as eutrophic. The nitrogen was the limiting nutrient for the phytoplanktonic growing. For this reason it must be regulated in order to control the reservoirs eutrophication.

Nevertheless, human impacts may affect their health status resulting in degradation and loss of biodiversity. The aim of the present study was to obtain data on the health status of a natural lake located in an indigenous reservation in the Brazilian Amazon, using the phytoplankton community changes along the rainy (June) and dry (November) seasons of 2006. We collected water (temperature, pH, Secchi depth and conductivity) and phytoplankton samples from the subsurface, middle of the water column, and approximately 30cm above the bottom, over 24-hour sampling periods, from a central station in the lake. Samples taken from biotic and abiotic variables were correlated using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Results showed that the lake exhibited high temperatures in both seasons, and showed thermal stratification only during the rainy season. Dissolved oxygen exhibited a clinograde pattern in the rainy season and high oxygen in the hypolimnion in the dry season. In the rainy season, the water near the bottom was acidic, turbid and had a greater concentration of phosphorus. Dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH, nitrite, total phosphorus and total dissolved phosphorus exhibited did l variations in the rainy season, whereas water temperature, dissolved oxygen, total nitrogen and total dissolved phosphorus exhibited significant differences between hours of the day in the dry season. The phytoplankton was represented by 39 taxa, and Chlorophyta showed the greatest species richness, totaling 25 taxa. Among Chlorophyta, desmids were the most diverse, accounting 52%. Bacillariophyta (nine species) was the second most diverse group. Cyanophyta was represented by three species, including Merismopedia tenuissima, the most abundant taxon. Despite the occurrence of taxa that indicate organic pollution, their biomass and frequency indicate that the system is not currently threatened.

The average CPUE of all size groups was found as 1.65 crayfish/fyke-net/night for fishing season in 2000, but 26.4% of which was below the legal minimum size (crayfish<90 mm). The average CPUE of legal-sized (crayfishgreater than or equal to90 mm) crayfish was 1,10 crayfish/fykenet/night. The annual catch of crayfish was estimated as 2990 tonnes. The length and weight compositions of crayfish captured in the fyke-nets have varied between 60 and 130 mm, and 6 and 71 g, respectively. The mean length and weight were found as 95.5 mm. and 28.8 g for all size groups and 100.1 mm and 33.0 g for legal-sized individuals.					; BALIK, ismet/G-8530-2016	ozkok, remziye/0000-0001-5643-2468; BALIK, ismet/0000-0003-2168-8572													1011-2367					JUN	2002	15	6					884	889																WOS:000174683100020
J	Lindholm, M				Lindholm, M			Predator-induced cyclomorphosis of Daphnia laevis (Branchiopoda, Cladocera) in a tropical floodplain (Okavango Delta, Botswana)	CRUSTACEANA												This study reports on cyclomorphosis of Daphnia laevis in a seasonal floodplain in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Data were sampled during the flooding season 1998, with laboratory experiments supplementing the field observations. As newborn fish fry entered the floodplain, the relative helmet size and tail spine length in D. laevis gradually increased, whereas total body length decreased. No relationship between temperature and cyclomorphosis was detected. Gut content analysis of 170 fish fry (predominantly Cichlidae) showed extensive planktivory, but D. laevis was negatively selected among the zooplankton. In general, the species of Cladocera were concentrated in the littoral, which was dominated by dense mats of Algae and macrophytes. Distribution of D. laevis, however, showed an opposite pattern, with highest densities (max. 114 ind. l(-1)) in the open pool area, where refugia from predation were scarce. This strongly suggests that the extensive cyclomorphosis observed is essential for the co-existence of fish fry and D. laevis. To our knowledge, this is the first study of cyclomorphosis in D. laevis.																			0011-216X	1568-5403				JUN	2002	75		6				803	814		10.1163/156854002760289773	http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156854002760289773													WOS:000178658600005
J	McCutchen, NA				McCutchen, NA			The response of stonefly (Plecoptera) nymphs to seasonal increases in predation risk	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												The main objective of this study was to determine if predation risk accounted for the patterns of stonefly (Plecoptera) nymph abundance in the Maligne Valley watershed, Jasper National Park, Alberta. Seasonal declines in nymph density corresponded to increased use of the Maligne Lake Outlet and Lower Maligne River by harlequin ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus). Neither decline represented a shift from aperiodic to nocturnal use of surface rocks. Rather, rock use remained aperiodic throughout the season despite increases in risk. The decline that occurred in the Maligne Lake Outlet also did not represent a shift from small to large surface rocks. These results, when combined with the results of an odor experiment, suggest that nymphs tend to avoid surface rocks when in the presence of harlequin ducks. Nymph density did not decline seasonally in the Middle Maligne River, a site free of harlequin ducks but inhabited year-round by brook char (Salvelinus fontinalis) and rainbow trout (Onchorhynchus mykiss). Nymphs in this site as well as those exposed to char odor were nocturnally biased in their use of the substrate surface. Overall, predation risk appears to play a strong role in the patterns of stonefly nymph abundance in the Maligne Valley watershed, although not in the way originally expected.																			0008-4301					JUN	2002	80	6					967	972		10.1139/Z02-078	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/Z02-078													WOS:000177215900001
J	Chilton, EW; Poarch, SM				Chilton, EW; Poarch, SM			Distribution and movement behavior of radio-tagged grass carp in two Texas reservoirs	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Triploid grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella with surgically implanted radio tags were stocked in two Texas reservoirs, Lake Texana (4,453 ha) and Lake Weatherford (445 ha), then tracked to determine magnitude and seasonality of movement patterns, diurnal changes in movement, and distribution relative to aquatic vegetation. After release, fish quickly became associated with macrophytes. More than 50% of observed movement during the first 3 months occurred within 1 week. Mean home range area was 3,234 ha (SE = 1,190), and mean core use area was 515 ha (SE = 193). Extensive movement was observed during 24-h tracking conducted immediately after release. However, five 24-h tracking surveys that were conducted at least 3 months after release showed little movement after acclimation. Somewhat elevated movement was evident from 0400 to 1200 hours. We conclude that immediately after stocking, an acclimation period with relatively intense movement occurs followed by an extended period of quiescence. Mean duration of the acclimation period was approximately 7 weeks for Lake Texana and 8 weeks for Lake Weatherford. Although both lakes in this study contained habitat considerably more heterogeneous than other sites where 24-h radio-tracking of grass carp had been done, individual fish did not appear to take advantage of the opportunity (via diel movement) to forage in different areas. Hence, daylight tracking alone should be sufficient to determine grass carp movement trends.																			0002-8487					MAY	1997	126	3					467	476		10.1577/1548-8659(1997)126<0467:DAMBOR>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1997)126<0467:DAMBOR>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1997XN04700009

Planting densities and configurations affect the growth and physiological processes of trees and are essential to investigate the effects of planting densities and configurations on the storage and allocation of NSC in trees for afforestation strategies. We investigated the seasonal dynamics of NSC in various organs (leaves, branches, stems, coarse roots, and fine roots) of Populus sp. in a stand density experiment located on the western bank of Hongze Lake, Jiangsu, China to assess the whole-tree carbon budget. We used a nested sampling design of stands with density as the first factor, which included two levels [400 vs. 277 stems per hectare (sph)], and spacing configuration (square vs. rectangular) as the nested factor. Our results indicated that the seasonal characteristics of NSC in poplar were obvious, with NSC in storage organs being consumed for growth from March to May and gradually accumulating after July, peaking in November, with the highest fluctuations in branches and stems. The NSC pool was dominated by starch (72.73 +/- 4.28%), and the stems (65.49 +/- 5.43%) contributed more than half of the whole-tree starch pool, and the branches were the largest sugar pool (39.88 +/- 8.36%). The seasonal patterns in poplar NSC were similar across different planting densities and configurations, whereas the NSC pool size varied significantly across configurations. Low planting density (277 sph) with square configuration increases NSC storage to optimum levels at the individual and stand scales. A square configuration with low intraspecific competition might be an optimal afforestation practice to enhance carbon sequestration in poplar plantations located in temperate monsoon climates.

Physicochemical, toxicological and ecological analysis of Gokcekaya Dam Lake	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY												Dams built to supply electricity, irrigation and fresh water, change the characteristics of the region they are located. The ecological, limnological characteristics and the quality of water in the dam reservoir deteriorate with time. In this study, the physicochemical, toxicological and ecological parameters of Gokcekaya Dam Lake's water, which is situated on Sakarya River were examined. The selected area has different characteristics from the others. This lake is situated between two other dam lakes on Sakarya River. So the main water of the lake comes from Sakarya Dam. During the years 2005-2006, water samples were taken from the lake surface and depths in seasonal periods, and the physical, chemical and biological parameters were examined to determine the modifications in the quality of water. It was seen that while the quality had no certain differences, the level of the nutrients in the water was low. The different characteristics of the coming water enriched the varieties of algae. It was concluded that the structure of the water in Gokcekaya Dam Lake is mezotrophic.					; ATICI, Tahir/AAB-8966-2021; Katırcıoğlu, Hikmet/AHE-2104-2022	Katircioglu, Hikmet/0000-0002-4866-6106; ATICI, Tahir/0000-0002-3396-3407; Akin, Beril/0000-0003-1730-154X													1684-5315					FEB 19	2008	7	4					444	449																WOS:000254899900021

Among phosphorus (P) fractions (HIELTJES and LIJKLEMA, 1980), NaOH-NRP amounted on an average to 50%, HCl-RP to 30%, NaOH-RP to 16%, and NH4Cl-RP to 4% of their sum. Seasonal changes in sediment P content were inconsistent with mass balance calculations and could be attributed to sediment redistribution caused by decreasing water level. High FelP ratio (26-30) and the aeration of surficial sediment by frequent resuspension kept phosphate adsorbed. Low pore-water SRP (commonly <10 mu g l(-1)) usually prevented phosphate release from surficial sediment. However, a storm in September 1996 (max. wind speed 16 m s(-1)) which coincided with the extremely low water level in the lake (mean depth 1.44 m), denuded deeper anoxic sediment layers and caused a SRP release of 193 mg P m(-2) d(-1).

J	SMITS, JGC; VANDERMOLEN, DT				SMITS, JGC; VANDERMOLEN, DT			APPLICATION OF SWITCH, A MODEL FOR SEDIMENT WATER EXCHANGE OF NUTRIENTS, TO LAKE VELUWE IN THE NETHERLANDS	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The formulations of SWITCH, a model for prediction of nutrient fluxes across the sediment-water interface, are presented. Results of the application to data on the sediment of Lake Veluwe are presented and discussed. SWITCH calculates the thicknesses of the aerobic and denitrifying layers on the basis of a step-wise steady state approach. The concentrations of detritus, ammonium, nitrate and phosphate in the sediments and the pore water are simulated dynamically using mass balance equations. Analysis of the data for Lake Veluwe show large spatial heterogeneity. This presents a major draw-back for the calibration of SWITCH, which focused on the silty part of the lake. The results show that the model simulates realistically and consistently layer thicknesses, concentrations and mass fluxes connected with the transport and conversion processes. The model appears to have potential for describing both seasonal patterns and developments on the long term. SWITCH calculates strongly increased phosphate return fluxes, following total reduction of the top sediments. An important hypothesis in the model is that phosphate precipitated in reduced sediment layers is transferred to the oxidized layer and dissolves instantaneously. This results in a decrease of the phosphorus content of the sediment, but also maintains high release rates of phosphorus after the reduction of the external phosphorus loading of Lake Veluwe. Model results and mass balance studies for the overlying water indicate that the removal of phosphorus to deeper sediment layers is underestimated or that dilution of the sediments occurs as the result of sedimentation.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR 5	1993	253	1-3					281	300		10.1007/BF00050749	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00050749													WOS:A1993KY82400024

Nuclides scavenged by particles in a newly established epilimnion accumulated in traps deployed weekly (20 m depth) at a site in the Uberlinger See, a northwestern bight of the lake. Activities of Cs-137 and Ru-103 (plus Ru-106, Sb-125, Ag-110m, and Ce-144) in trapped material collected during the subsequent 21 weeks is here described by a two-stage scavenging model involving (1) nuclide transfer to "reactive particles" with negligible mean settling rate and (2) their entrainment by large, rapidly settling particles dominated by chemically passive calcite formed seasonally in the epilimnion. The model employs first-order kinetics where forward rate coefficients depend on time-dependent concentrations of candidate "reactive phases" such as total suspended matter (TSM), particulate inorganic matter (PIM), particulate organic matter (POM), and particulate aluminum (PAL). First-order, irreversible nuclide transfer to nonexchangeable portions of reactive phases is also included. Vertical transport is described by a time-dependent rate of particle settling through a vertically and horizontally well-mixed epilimnion of increasing depth. Model calculations reproduced observations well with PAL as the "reactive phase" for Cs-137 and POM for Ru-103. Calculated reaction rates for all nuclides were sufficiently high that activity changes were dominated by temporal variations in pertinent state variables. Selective chemical extraction of Chernobyl Cs-137 from sediments and study of uptake kinetics by addition of radiocesium to fresh sediment suspensions supported model results indicating its negligible affinity for calcite, probable transfer to clay minerals (for which PAL is a surrogate), particle concentration-independent distribution coefficient, and significant transfer to nonexchangeable sites. For Ru-103, model calculations implied no transfer to nonexchangeable sites and a forward rate term proportional to the square root of POM concentration, a result in accord with the Honeyman-Santschi "Brownian pumping" model. The unusual coincidence of a pulsed nuclide loading with conditions of thermal stratification and limited vertical water mass exchange, together with frequent measurement of important state variables, permitted successful evaluation of a reaction-kinetic model under markedly non-steady state conditions.

Controls of Variability in the Laurentian Great Lakes Terrestrial Water Budget	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The land surface hydrology of the North American Great Lakes region regulates ecosystem water availability, lake levels, vegetation dynamics, and agricultural practices. In this study, we analyze the Great Lakes terrestrial water budget using the Noah-MP land surface model to characterize the catchment hydrological regimes and identify the dominant quantities contributing to the variability in the land surface hydrology. We show that the Great Lakes domain is not hydrologically uniform and strong spatiotemporal differences exist in the regulators of the hydrological budget at daily, monthly, and annual timescales. Subseasonally, precipitation and soil moisture explain nearly all the terrestrial water budget variability in the southern basins, while the northern latitudes are snow-dominated regimes. Seasonal assessments reveal greater differences among the basins. Precipitation, evaporation, and runoff are the dominant sources of variability at lower latitudes, while at higher latitudes, terrestrial water storage in the form of ground snowpack and soil moisture has the leading role. Differences in land cover categorizations, for example, croplands, forests, or urban zones, further induce spatial differences in the hydrological characteristics. This quantification of variability in the terrestrial water cycle embedded at different temporal scales is important to assess the impacts of changes in climate and land cover on catchment sensitivities across the diverse hydroclimate of the Great Lakes region.

Perch diet was examined using gut content analysis (GCA) and stable isotope analysis (SIA), and individual specialisation was calculated in two study lakes within 2years. Mostly only one diet category was present in the perch stomach, with more variation in the diet in the Most lake compared to the Milada lake between 2013 and 2014. The calculated degree of individual specialisation indicated higher specialisation in the Most lake. Interestingly, despite the different or almost uniform diet composition between the years, the total niche width (based on SIA) of the population remained similar in both lakes. This suggests that the overall variation in the sources utilised by the entire population remained consistent between the years. GCA mostly indicated zooplankton as the prevailing food source, whereas SIA indicated significant utilisation of YOY fish earlier that year, an information that was completely missed by the GCA of fish caught in September. The differences between GCA and SIA results could be attributed to the different time intervals reflected by the methods, but possibly to the conversion of the diet into the body tissues that is reflected by SIA and may depend on the diet's nutritional values rather than the proportion of different prey consumed.

The 2012 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement includes a lake ecosystem objective that commits Canada and the United States to minimize the extent of hypoxic zones, with a particular emphasis on Lake Erie. To meet that objective, Canada and the United States adopted a 40% total phosphorus load reduction target for the western and central basins of the lake. To help assess progress in minimizing Lake Erie's hypoxic zones, the Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR) convened a virtual summit in October 2021 to update the state-of-knowledge regarding hypoxia in Lake Erie. This special section summarizes the recommendations for monitoring, assessment, modeling and reporting of hypoxia that resulted from the workshop and features five papers that present new information about hypoxia in Lake Erie. Recognizing that hypoxia occurs in other areas within the Great Lakes basin, a paper investigating seasonal drivers of hypoxia dynamics in Muskegon Lake a drowned river mouth that flows into Lake Michigan, is also featured.

Quantifying oxythermal fish habitat quality in a large freshwater ecosystem*	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The global occurrence and severity of aquatic hypoxia has been exacerbated by anthropogenic activities such as excess nutrient loading and climate change. There are various mechanisms by which hypoxia may affect aquatic organisms and impacts of hypoxia may occur synergistically with other environmental conditions (e.g., temperature). Nonetheless, aquatic resource managers often lack appropriate indicators for measuring the strength and severity of hypoxic conditions. Without standard methods to index hypoxic conditions, it is difficult to evaluate whether management practices are resulting in water quality and habitat improvements. We developed a novel framework for the application of fish habitat quality modeling to assess the severity of hypoxia in a large lake ecosystem. The framework produces three-dimensional measures of fish bioenergetic growth-rate potential in response to spatially-explicit oxythermal conditions and can be applied to other aquatic systems where vertical profile data are collected. We applied this framework to the seasonally hypoxic central basin of Lake Erie using a long-term water quality dataset, then compared our biological indicator to recognized drivers and indices of hypoxic conditions in Lake Erie. Our model application summarized spatiotemporally complex habitat quality conditions for six different fish species and life stages. Annual summary indices of habitat quality varied among years and species. Furthermore, our annual indicator was not strongly correlated with annual nutrient loading and an existing index of hypoxia severity. We suggest that quantification of this habitat quality index is a useful approach for studying the annual impact of hypoxia on biota in aquatic systems.

The model simulates both seasonal trends and spatial variations. The model kinetic framework includes total organic carbon (TOC), THMFP, chlorophyll a, zooplankton, Secchi disk depth, dissolved oxygen, dissolved TDP, and total phosphorus (TP). Calculated THMFP concentrations are dependent on external watershed TOC loading, algal cell densities, and TOC associated with extracellular products. Model performance is evaluated by comparison of calculated results with measured data from Lake Youngs.

Assessing Human Health Risk of Metal Accumulations in a wild carp fish from Selected Sites of a River Loaded with Municipal and Industrial Wastes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												This 4x2 factorial study compared the effect of four sites (A=Siphon as upstream, and B=Shandera, C=Sunder and D= Balloki as 3 downstream sites) during low and high flow seasons of river Ravi on metal cconcentrations in muscles from Cirrhinus (C) mrigala, a bottom feeder carp. While weight and length of studied specimens did not differ significantly (P>0.05). Overall metal accumulations appeared in the order of calcium (Ca) > sodium (Na) > potassium (K) > magnesium (Mg) > zinc (Zn) > iron (Fe) > manganese (Mn) > copper (Cu) > chromium (Cr) > lead (Pb) > nickel (Ni) > cadmium (Cd). The sampling sites were significantly different (P<0.001) for all the metals except Mg. The metal accumulation pattern for sites was C > B > D > A, except Mg, Pb, Mn, Ni, Zn and Fe. The macro metal contents, except K and trace metals except Cd were significantly higher during low flow than the high flow season. The bioaccumulation of Cd, Cr and Mn were greater than those permissible for human consumption by the WHO standards. The most alarming results contradict the views of local fish consumers that riverine fish are more healthy and valuable than the pond fish. This fish species inhabiting the downstream sites was more polluted and may be a source of risk to consumer health. Regular monitoring is obligatory to evaluate eco-health of the river Ravi by choosing perhaps C. mrigala as a bio-indicator which might provide reliable measurements to frequently assess environmental quality of rivers.					; Shakir, Hafiz/S-5839-2019	Shakir, Dr. Hafiz Abdullah/0000-0003-3661-3725; 													1735-6865	2008-2304				SPR	2015	9	2					545	552																WOS:000357761400016
J	Hegelbach, J				Hegelbach, J			Water temperature and phytophenology indicate the earlier onset of oviposition in Eurasian Dipper (Cinclus cinclus) from the Swiss Lowlands	JOURNAL FUR ORNITHOLOGIE												Initiation of reproduction was investigated in Eurasian Dipper (Cinclus cinclus) along riparian habitat of tributaries flowing into lower Lake Zurich (Switzerland). Total length of these drainages is 40 km and Dippers nested from 410 - 680 in asl. From 1992 to 2000 about 46 pairs per year had 552 successful broods with nestlings of at least 8 to 12 days of age. Meterological data (i. e., air temperature, days with rain, amount of rainfall, amount of sunshine) and water temperature in a study area river were obtained from government weather stations. Phytophenological data, i.e. full flowering of Coltsfoot (Tussilago farfara), Wood Anemone (Anemone nemorosa), and Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale), were also available from stations within the study area. Dippers initiated breeding in February or March of each year. with considerable variability among years. Earliest oviposition was 9 February 1995, and again 1997, while latest was 9 March 1992. The median date each year for appearance of the first 25 % of all broods was significantly correlated with February water temperatures (Spearman rank correlation. p < 0.001), with February air temperatures (p < 0.002), and with the flowering of two early phanerogams (Coltsfoot and Wood Anemone; p < 0.025), but not Dandelion (p < 0.1). According to historical data, the initiation of reproduction for Dipper at Lake Zurich occurs now earlier in the year than it did in Britain, Germany, and Switzerland. This may be due either to global warming, or (more significantly) to an increase in water temperatures as a result of urbanisation. Warmer waters accelerate life cycles of aquatic arthropods and generate earlier emergences of insects that form the prey base of the Dipper. Since avian reproduction is cued by trophic resources, an earlier appearance of aquatic insects will concomitantly induce an earlier breeding season for the Dipper.																			0021-8375					JUL	2001	142	3					284	294		10.1046/j.1439-0361.2001.00080.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0361.2001.00080.x													WOS:000170116800003

We show, based on stable isotope and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) data, that the relationship between suspended POM and active biomass changes as thermal stratification persists. Stable isotope data indicated that sources of suspended POM change between July and October, moving from primary production at a deep chlorophyll layer to recycling-based production in surface waters. Concomitant change in the distribution of active bacterial and eukaryotic biomass was observed as indicated by rRNA abundances. Active bacterial and eukaryotic biomass were highly correlated throughout the year. However, the correlation be tween suspended POM and active bacterial biomass varied seasonally and reflected the transitions in planktonic ecology. Suspended POM from depths > 60 m was primarily of sedimentary origin. The combined application of stable isotope and rRNA analysis of suspended POM indicated a dynamic relationship between the bulk POM reservoir and living planktonic biomass.

J	ROSENBERRY, DO; STURROCK, AM; WINTER, TC				ROSENBERRY, DO; STURROCK, AM; WINTER, TC			EVALUATION OF THE ENERGY BUDGET METHOD OF DETERMINING EVAPORATION AT WILLIAMS-LAKE, MINNESOTA, USING ALTERNATIVE INSTRUMENTATION AND STUDY APPROACHES	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Best estimates of evaporation at Williams Lake, north central Minnesota, were determined by the energy budget method using optimum sensors and optimum placement of sensors. These best estimates are compared with estimates derived from using substitute data to determine the effect of using less accurate sensors, simpler methods, or remotely measured data. Calculations were made for approximately biweekly periods during five open water seasons. For most of the data substitutions that affected the Bowen ratio, new values of evaporation differed little from best estimates. The three data substitution methods that caused the largest deviations from the best evaporation estimates were (1) using changes in the daily average surface water temperature as an indicator of the lake heat storage term, (2) using shortwave radiation, air temperature, and atmospheric vapor pressure data from a site 110 km away, and (3) using an analog surface water temperature probe. Recalculations based on these data substitutions resulted in differences from the best estimates as much as 89%, 21%, and 10%, respectively. The data substitution method that provided evaporation values that most closely matched the best estimates was measurement of the lake heat storage term at one location in the lake, rather than at 16 locations. Evaporation values resulting from this substitution method usually were within 2% of the best estimates.

The annual mean molar N:P uptake ratio at ambient concentrations was 13.9 (range = 4.8-34.2); uptake of nitrate, ammonium and phosphate were always below saturation indicating both N and P deficiency. Organisms > 280-mu-m were responsible for 0-60% of ammonium and 0-40% of phosphate regeneration; 40-100% of the ammonium and 34-98% of phosphate regeneration occurred in the < 3-mu-m fraction. The < 3-mu-m fraction accounted for 7-70% of the ammonium and 6-64% of the phosphate uptake. Results from antibiotic treatments indicated that both prokaryotic and eukaryotic ammonium uptake was important, and that eukaryotes accounted for 53-98% of the ammonium regeneration. During thermal stratification, heterotrophic ammonium and phosphate regeneration by organisms < 3-mu-m supplied much of the inorganic N and P in the epilimnion. Estimated rates of allochthonous and diffusive (i.e. 'new') ammonium, nitrate and phosphate input were < 5% of biotic regeneration. These results suggests that (i) both N and P dynamics should be considered when examining nutrient regulation of primary productivity of oligotrophic lakes, (ii) bacteria probably compete with phytoplankton for both ammonium and phosphate, (iii) biotic regeneration is the main source of nutrients to the epilimnion during stratification, and (iv) crustacean zooplankton were relatively unimportant sources of regenerated ammonium and phosphate.

J	SHIELDS, WM; CROOK, JR				SHIELDS, WM; CROOK, JR			BARN SWALLOW COLONIALITY - A NET COST FOR GROUP BREEDING IN THE ADIRONDACKS	ECOLOGY												To explore the costs and benefits of groups living in a facultatively social bird, we studied the reproductive ecology of a marked population of Barn Swallows (Hirundo rustica) at the Cranberry Lake Biological Station in the Adirondack Mountains of New York State. Throughout its range, the Barn Swallow breeds solitarily or in small groups. From 1979 through 1985 we gathered reproductive and mortality data in colonies varying in size and density. Birds living in larger colonies tended to be younger and to breed later, on average than solitary breeders. Breeding success was less for birds in large colonies than for birds breeding solitarily or in small groups. Larger colonies did not provide obvious benefits that offset the reduced reproductive success. Nests in larger colonies were infested more by a bloodsucking blow fly larva (Protocalliphora hirundo) than were nests in smaller colonies. The fraction of nests infested and the mean number of parasites per nestling also increased as the breeding season progressed. Since parasitism appeared to be the major source of nestling mortality, the increased parasite loads were probably the major cost of living in larger groups in our area. Birds in large colonies suffered a net reproductive loss relative to those breeding alone or in smaller groups.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				OCT	1987	68	5					1373	1386		10.2307/1939221	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1939221													WOS:A1987K221900023

The gametogenic cycle and spawning of the short-necked clam, Paphia undulata Born, 1778 (Bivalvia: Veneridae) from Timsah Lake, Suez Canal, Egypt	BMC ZOOLOGY												Background Paphia undulata, The Short-Necked Clam, is an edible marine bivalve that is consumed internationally and locally in Egypt. Overfishing and pollution have caused population declines in Egyptian fisheries during the last decade. Accurate reproductive biology knowledge is critical for designing long-term exploitation strategy for this resource. P. undulata spawning and gametogenic cycle research were carried out from January to December 2020 along Timsah Lake, Suez Canal, Egypt. Results These clams are functionally dioecious with a very low incidence of hermaphroditism. The sex ratio of the clam population was 1.0:1.07:0.04 for male, female and hermaphrodite respectively. The shell lengths of the collected clams were 4.640.83 cm in males, 4.55 +/- 0.9 cm in females and 4.19 +/- 0.3 cm in hermaphrodite clams. The sizes at the onset of sexual maturity in both males and females were 2.1 cm and 2.5 cm respectively. Conclusions Reproductive studies revealed that this species has a prolonged spawning season that is not restricted to a specific period.																				2056-3132				SEP 13	2023	8	1							20	10.1186/s40850-023-00182-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40850-023-00182-9								37705062					WOS:001186957100001
J	Kreb, D				Kreb, D			Density and abundance of the Irrawaddy dolphin, Orcaella brevirostris, in the Mahakam River of East Kalimantan, Indonesia: A comparison of survey techniques	RAFFLES BULLETIN OF ZOOLOGY												On-going monitoring surveys are being conducted on a freshwater Irrawaddy dolphin population, locally referred to as the Pesut, inhabiting the Mahakam River in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. The aim of the study is to provide detailed information on the abundance, distribution, and ecology relevant to conservation of this population. This paper describes results from surveys in February 1999 - July 2000 that relate to population abundance estimates and compares different survey techniques. The primary goal of these investigations is to develop a conservation program for effective management of Indonesia's only freshwater dolphin population, which is considered to be critically endangered. In this study, both modified strip-transect and direct count survey-methods were employed. Total search effort in the Mahakam River amounted to 4260 km (397 hours). Results of eight sighting surveys indicate that the dolphins in the mainstream Mahakam range from 180 km above the mouth to 480 km upstream, seasonally inclusive of several tributaries and lakes. However, dolphins are reported to sporadically move as far down- and upstream as 80 km and 600 km, respectively. The distribution of the dolphins changes seasonally and is influenced by water levels and variation in prey availability. The middle Mahakam area (MMA) and tributaries between 180 km and 350 km upstream were identified as primary dolphin habitat, based on highest dolphin densities. Sighting rates calculated for medium water levels in the MMA in 1999 and 2000 are nearly similar (ca. 0.09 dolphins/km, CV=25%, 49%). Highest sighting rate for the MMA was recorded at low water levels (0.142 dolphins/ km, CV=51%), indicating that dolphins are congregating in the main river in deeper waters. Lowest sighting rate was recorded at high water levels (0.035 dolphins/ km, CV=33%), suggesting that dolphins have moved upstream into the tributaries. Total mean abundance-estimates, based on density estimates and direct counts, were both 34 dolphins. However, the mean estimate based on density estimates exhibited more variation (CV=25%), than the mean direct count estimate with associated CV of 5%. Unless a modified density sampling technique has been developed that is appropriate to the river conditions and takes into account dolphins daily migrations between main river and tributaries, direct count studies seem a more useful tool for assessing abundance of this particular freshwater population.																			0217-2445	2345-7600				MAY 1	2002				10			85	95																WOS:000177636500009

In this study we have demonstrated that Etheria elliptica, the freshwater oyster of equatorial Africa, accretes layers of shell having a lunar month periodicity. Separation and oxygen isotopic analyses of the individual monthly layers affords a qualitative picture of seasonal change. Fourteen monthly samples of E. elliptica, collected near Kisumu on the Winam Gulf of Lake Victoria, gave oxygen isotope ratios in the penultimate layer of their shells in excellent agreement with the individual layers of a shell whose growth covered the same period. The variation in isotope ratios correlates clearly with the rainfall pattern of that region of East Africa.																			0031-0182					JAN	1996	119	3-4					215	219		10.1016/0031-0182(95)00019-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(95)00019-4													WOS:A1996TW85700002

By using different approaches, diffusion fluxes for dissolved iron, manganese and phosphate are calculated and used to describe the processes occurring at the sediment-water interface as well as in the hypolimnion of the lake. These data are used in the elaboration of a qualitative model to describe the chemical behaviour of the sedimentary interface of an anoxic lake with emphasis on the Fe/P/S system. A corona model is proposed to explain the evolution with time of the diffusion process by estimating the relative contribution of bottom and lateral sediment surfaces to the total fluxes of dissolved elements diffusing from the sediment to the overlying water. As the hypolimnion becomes more anoxic, it has been observed that lateral sediment surfaces (16 to 10 meters in depth) represents a larger supplier of diffusing dissolved components than the bottom sediment portion (bottom to 18 meters).

Size-fractionated photosynthesis was used to characterize changes in phytoplankton characteristics during periods of seasonal mixing and stratification. Seasonal variations of P-max showed size-related differences; with maximum values in July for the picoplankton and in November for the nanoplankton. Similar patterns of variability in alpha and l(k) were observed for the two size fractions throughout the season. However, size-related differences in the magnitudes of l(k) indicate that the picoplankton have lower light requirements than the nanoplankton to saturate photosynthesis and can sustain large variations of irradiance in the surface layer during their growth season. Tight inverse correlations between in situ irradiance and alpha, at the seasonal scale, indicate that the two size fractions respond to lower irradiance by increasing their photosynthetic efficiencies. P-max and alpha are strongly correlated for the two size fractions, which suggests that biochemical processes controlling these two parameters are closely coupled. Hydrodynamics may influence photosynthesis differently for pico- and nanoplankton. Picoplankton in Basin 1 are adapted to higher irradiance than those in the euphotic zone of Basin 2, as shown by their lower alpha and higher l(k) during most of the study period, which may be explained by more frequent exposure to high irradiance through mixing in the shallowest basin. Vertically changing photosynthetic parameters in Basin 2 show that both pico- and nanoplankton were photoadapted as a function of depth. The size-related pattern of residence in the water column coupled to the turbulence regime in the epilimnion may be responsible for size-related differences in photoadaptation.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				JAN	1996	18	1					45	61		10.1093/plankt/18.1.45	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/18.1.45													WOS:A1996TT83600004

Sixty adults (30 males and 30 females) of this species were caught during the flooding seasons from both Lake Nokoue, and Lake Toho (as a reference). The physicochemical parameters of the water and the heavy metal contents (Pb, Cd, Hg) in water/sediment/fish of three sites (S1, S2, S3) in Lake Nokoue and two sites (S4, S5) in Lake Toho were analysed. Results confirm very strong organic status with organic pollution index ranging from 1.25 to 1.5. Pb, Cd, and Hg levels in the water/sediment/fish muscle tissue of Lake Nokoue were far exceeding international standards. The histopathology of gonads revealed testis-ova up to 40% in males and follicular atretic oocytes up to 33.33% in females, indicated oestrogenic effects from the pollutants with a delay of spermatogenesis and stimulation of oogenesis. The histopathology of the liver revealed the presence of regressive changes. The findings call for actions to protect the ecosystem from pollution and attention in terms of health of humans consuming fish products from Lake Nokoue.																			0275-7540	1029-0370				AUG 9	2023	39	7					726	752		10.1080/02757540.2023.2253225	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02757540.2023.2253225		SEP 2023											WOS:001058819800001
J	ECKMANN, R				ECKMANN, R			A HYDROACOUSTIC STUDY OF THE PELAGIC SPAWNING BEHAVIOR OF WHITEFISH (COREGONUS-LAVARETUS) IN LAKE CONSTANCE	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The horizontal and vertical distribution patterns of pelagic spawning whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) were studied by echosounding from the end of the growing season (early November) until after spawning (late January). During early November, whitefish inhabited similar depths during day and night, but during spawning displayed vertical migrations of up to 50 m amplitude: whitefish ascended at dusk and descended at dawn. At the end of the spawning season, vertical migrations ceased. juveniles took part in the daily migrations, but only sexually mature specimens invaded the uppermost 10 m of water, while maturing and juvenile individuals and spent females stayed deeper during the night. This vertical distribution pattern is interpreted as a means to increase encounter probability among mature specimens. Diel vertical migration of the entire population is suggested to be an aid to avoid cannibalism on freshly spawned eggs during settling to the lake bottom. Total fish density estimates increased during upward migration and decreased during downward migration; this may be the result of differences in target strength caused by both reduced swimbladder volume and positive tilt while in deep waters. Highly reproducible abundance estimates were obtained during night when whitefish were evenly distributed at the top of their vertical range.																			0706-652X					JUN	1991	48	6					995	1002		10.1139/f91-116	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f91-116													WOS:A1991FV22600005

Species-specific grazing selectivity coefficients were calculated for the dominant phytoplankton species from weekly experiments. Specific selectivities were found to be largely invariant through the growing season. All zooplankters grazed more efficiently on phytoflagellates such as Rhodomonas and Cryptomonas than on coccales such as Chlorella and Scenedesmus, regardless of their relative abundance in the phytoplankton assemblage. Filtering rates did not decrease in the presence of filamentous algae. Certain filamentous species were grazed efficiently, but only by D. hyalina: Anabaena planktonica, Oscillatoria amphigranulata, and Stephanodiscus binderanus. Large diatom colonies like Asterionella formosa and Fragilaria crotonensis were grazed well only by Cyclops sp. Some algal species were consistently selected against: Mougeotia thylespora and Dinobryon sp. The species-specific selectivity coefficients can be used as weighting factors to assess the ''effective food concentration'' relative to Rhodomonas minuta, a reference species for optimal food.																			0029-8549	1432-1939					1986	69	1					86	94		10.1007/BF00399042	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00399042								28311689					WOS:A1986A942600013

Our preliminary investigations suggested a relationship between a low level of the carotenoid astaxanthin in yolk sac fry of Baltic salmon and elevated mortality attributable to M74. The objective of this study was to further detail this relationship during the spawning seasons of 1994 and 1995 in salmon taken from hatcheries on the Baltic Sea, the Swedish west coast, and Lake Vanern. Total carotenoids and astaxanthin were measured in female muscle tissue and eggs. The carotenoid concentration and the ratio of astaxanthin to total carotenoids were significantly lower in the muscle of Baltic salmon females than in the muscle of feral females from salmon stocks on the Swedish west coast and in Lake Vanern. A relationship between low muscle levels of astaxanthin in Baltic salmon females and M74 in the progeny was observed, and yolk sac fry from eggs with low astaxanthin content tended to exhibit M74 more often than fry from eggs with high astaxanthin concentration. The low levels of astaxanthin observed in Baltic salmon eggs and yolk sac fry may be part of a general astaxanthin deficiency in the feral Baltic salmon.																			0892-2284		1-888569-08-5				1998	21						26	30																WOS:000074636200004

One series of experiments was carried out using generation times from 50 to 200 hours and aged, normal, and enriched media, all of natural origin. Another series of experiments examined the bacterial growth efficiency during the growth season in eutrophic Frederiksborg Slotsso, in relation to changes in the planktonic communities and to factors controlling the bacterial incorporation of H-3-thymidine. Attachment of bacteria to the inner surfaces of the experimental flasks was examined using various types of bottles, adding glass tubes to the bottles, and measuring H-3-thymidine incorporation and direct cell counts of attached and free-living bacteria. Attachment of bacteria varied, and in one example up to 36% of the thymidine incorporation was by attached bacteria after 4 days. It was calculated that 36% of attached bacteria caused an underestimation of the growth efficiency of 11%. The mean growth efficiency tended to decrease with generation time using enriched medium (47 to 19%) and aged medium (35 to 12%), and tended to decrease with medium quality (enriched > normal > aged media) from 37% to 27%. The only significant difference in growth efficiency occurred in relation to generation time, in samples with enriched medium (unpaired t-test, P < 0.05). The overall mean value for all generation times and media was 30% (SEM = 3%, n = 24). From April to October, the growth efficiency was determined 5 times in samples from Frederiksborg Slotsso. The overall mean value was 31% (SEM = 3%, n = 30), and there was no significant change in the growth efficiency during the period measured. In June, three bioassay experiments revealed that carbon limitation controlled bacterial incorporation of 3H-thymidine, whereas additions of phosphate and nitrate did not change the incorporation rates. The narrow range of growth efficiencies obtained in this study (mean 31%, SEM = 2%, n = 54) suggests that changes in substrate quality in the media applied and in the eutrophic samples examined causes only subtle changes in the growth efficiency.

The operation of TGD has changed the spatial and temporal distribution of streamflow in the middle and lower Yangtze River. The operation of TGD can also have varying degrees of impact on groundwater due to stream-aquifer interactions. Jianghan Plain is a major farming area in southern China, where groundwater is a critical source for domestic and agricultural use. Therefore, it is important to study the impact of the operation of TGD on the groundwater level in Jianghan Plain. Based on the STL algorithm, this study examined the interannual, annual, and random variations of groundwater levels in Jianghan Plain, analyzed and quantified the impacts of various factors including the operation of TGD that cause the spatial and temporal variation of the groundwater level. The results show that the operation of TGD can reduce the amplitude of the groundwater level and the frequency of extreme values. From upstream to downstream, the impact of TGD operation on the groundwater level shows a decreasing trend. The operation of TGD has a strong impact on the interannual variation within 6.71 km and annual variation within 5.77 km from the Yangtze River. The conclusions of this study can provide recommendations for local governments to develop groundwater management policies.																			1866-6280	1866-6299				SEP	2023	82	18							417	10.1007/s12665-023-11110-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-023-11110-y													WOS:001052553500001

P. alcon prefers the tallest (most conspicuous) host plants and plants with a larger number of flowers (i.e., more than 90% of all eggs were deposited on 12% of the tallest plants >= 30 cm), where eggs are deposited in the upper quarter of the plant height, usually on calyx (66.1%) and corolla (29.9%), and rarely on leaves or stems. Eggs are mostly deposited singly or in groups of two (> 50%) on a single plant, and eggs were found only on less than 3% of examined plants. Butterfly density was estimated at about 60 individuals per hectare. Obtained results indicate that preferences for oviposition sites are not random, and monitoring population density may provide important insight into the future population status of P. alcon.																			1505-2249					SEP	2023	71	1					15	25		10.3161/15052249PJE2023.71.1.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.3161/15052249PJE2023.71.1.002													WOS:001067736800002

The ecotoxic effect of heavy metals in surface water and sediments of the Madre de Dios River was evaluated on the microcrustacean Daphnia magna and the fish Paracheirodon innesi, in surface water and sediments by determining the toxicity level with the Roig ecotoxic scale, based on at the median lethal concentration (LC50) for D. magna and with the median effective concentration (EC50) for the sublethal effect "strange swimming" of P. innesi. Four points were sampled in the dry season in 2019 between the area of the crossing with the tributary Colorado River and the port of the Boca Colorado district, in Madre de Dios. Heavy metals were determined in water and sediment, additionally evaluating the pH and electrical conductivity. At the four sampling points, the Hg in surface water and sediments did not exceed the Peruvian Environmental Quality Standard for water from jungle rivers - Conservation of the aquatic environment (<0.0001 mg L-1). LC50 values in water and sediment in D. magna were non-toxic. The point with the highest toxicity for mortality and strange swimming in P. innesi in water was between the mining area and the port of Boca Colorado and it is considered slightly toxic. An analysis of acute and chronic ecotoxicological effects in Amazon aquatic planktonic, benthic and nektonic organisms is suggested.

When external nutrient inputs are controlled and internal loading intensifies, the dissolved oxygen condition at the water-sediment interface improves during non-algal bloom seasons, but more anaerobic conditions occur during algal bloom seasons. Macroinvertebrates, living at the water-sediment interface, are particularly sensitive to such changes. Our results indicate that, in large shallow Lake Taihu, the changes in dissolved oxygen conditions at the water-sediment interface, caused by intensified internal loading, significantly affect the community structure, diversity, and response to eutrophication of macroinvertebrates.Abstract In eutrophic lakes, even if external loading is controlled, internal nutrient loading delays the recovery of lake eutrophication. When the input of external pollutants is reduced, the dissolved oxygen environment at the sediment interface improves in a season without algal blooms. As an important part of lake ecosystems, macroinvertebrates are sensitive to hypoxia caused by eutrophication; however, how this change affects macroinvertebrates is still unknown. In this study, we analysed the monitoring data of northern Lake Taihu from 2007 to 2019. After 2007, the external loading of Lake Taihu was relatively stable, but eutrophication began to intensify after 2013, and the nutrients in the sediments also began to decline, which was related to the efficient use of nutrients by algal blooms. The community structure and population density of macroinvertebrates showed different responses in different stages. In particular, the density of oligochaetes and the Shannon-Wiener index showed significant differences in their response to different stages, and their sensitivity to eutrophication was significantly reduced. Under eutrophication conditions dominated by internal loading, frequent hypoxia occurs at the sediment interface only when an algal bloom erupts. When there is no bloom, the probability of sediment hypoxia is significantly reduced under the disturbance of wind. Our results indicate that the current method for evaluating lake eutrophication based on oligochaetes and the Shannon-Wiener diversity index may lose its sensitivity.					; Dong, Rui/HRC-9492-2023; Qin, Boqiang/E-5900-2013; Deng, Jianming/AAN-2998-2020	Cai, Yongjiu/0000-0002-3560-3798; 														2079-7737				SEP	2023	12	9							1247	10.3390/biology12091247	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology12091247								37759646					WOS:001077209600001

The cladoceran was found at concentrations up to 1,900 ind l-1 in the oxygenated epilimnion of the lake while most of the available food was concentrated in the metalimnion. D. pulex was never found in the hypolimnion with sulfide concentrations up to 1.2 mM. Probably due to the food distribution, D. pulex was forced to move into the anoxic lower part of the metalimnion. The animals spent most of the day at the surface, and descended especially at dawn to the upper level of the sulfide distribution. Mainly animals of sizes between 1.3 and 1.9 mm migrated. This pattern of population movement was related only to the food distribution and the oxygen profiles, and not to other factors commonly implicated in zooplankton vertical migrations (fish predation was absent). There was strong variability in the horizontal distribution of the animals that we associated to swarming behavior. During our study the population was in decline as shown by the lower indices of fertility and the higher mean sizes of the animals in the later weeks of sampling as compared to the first week.

WATER BALANCE OF THE SHIRA - ITKUL LAKE SYSTEM (KHAKASSIA)	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL												Shira and Itkul lakes (the lake water surface areas are 35.90 and 23.25 km(2) respectively) are located in the steppe zone in Khakassia (Russian Federation). The distance between lakes is 3 to 4 km. The conditions of water resource formation for both reservoirs are similar. However, the salinity of Shira Lake is 12-30 g/kg, the salinity of Itkul Lake is less than 1 g/kg. The mathematical model of lake water balance formation on the average for the long-term period was developed for an explanation of these differences. The evaporation from the catchment surfaces at the snow cover presence was calculated using the P. P. Kuzin method. The M. I. Budyko method was used in case of snow cover absence. The evaporation from water surfaces was estimated using the turbulent diffusion method (depending on the wind velocity and humidity deficit). The catchment moistening was calculated as the sum of liquid atmospheric precipitation and snow melt. The annual water redistribution is considered due to the formation and melting of the seasonal ice cover. The Son River flow into Shira Lake was determined using long-term observation data delivered by the Russian Federal Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring Service (Roshydromet). The Karysh River flow into Itkul Lake was estimated according to the annual mean discharge, which is 1.6 L/(s square km(2)). The annual mean discharge was calculated as the mean value of the Son River flow (at the point near village Spirinskaya Zaimka) and the Tuim River flow (at the point near village Tuim). The groundwater inflow to the lakes corresponds to the groundwater discharge into rivers (the Son River for Lake Shira and the Karysh River for Lake Itkul). The groundwater discharge corresponds to the river flows from December to February. From March till November it is defined by linear interpolation between the values for February and December. Wastewater dump in Shira Lake corresponds to the water drawoff from Itkul Lake. The annual change of the volume of waters of Shira Lake is calculated according to the Roshydromet data about average monthly lake water levels. The difference between water inflow and outflow in Shira Lake is determined. This difference as a whole for one year can be considered as groundwater inflow. Its average volume is 6791,000 m(3)/year (the calculation error is 5433,000-8149,000 m(3)/year). The groundwater inflow is possible from Itkul Lake, the water level in which is 100 m higher than that in Shira Lake. Thus the average groundwater velocity is 0.041 m/day, and the value of hydraulic conductivity is 1.391 m/day. Thus, these lakes are connected (hydraulic connection). Itkul Lake can be considered as the drainage lake. Only Shira Lake can be considered as a reservoir without a water flow. The mechanism of its water salinity formation is determined, first of all, by evaporation of water. Itkul Lake is characterized by more active water exchange in comparison with Shira Lake. Therefore, evaporation from its water surface in June-July does not result in the high salinity like in Shira Lake. Besides, little time of water-sediment interaction is observed.

Its distribution in the historic French Quarter of New Orleans 23 years later (I 989) and in 1991 and 1992 is reported here using counts of alates from light-traps, Light-trappings revealed a Quarter-wide distribution of the termite. C. formosanus shows an extended pause in flight behavior in the middle of the two-month flight season that is predictable and independent of weather. A colony-level mechanism, namely, developmental inhibition of nymphs by alates, may regulate this intermission in flight. The sex-ratio of light-trapped alates varies over time, but is generally female-biased. especially at the height of the flight season.

Its breeding season, size and age at first sexual maturity, fecundity and egg size were studied between October 1994 and October 1996. The breeding season occurred during the period from January to September, with a peak between April-May and July.

J	Perrin, CJ; Ashley, KI; Larkin, GA				Perrin, CJ; Ashley, KI; Larkin, GA			Effect of drawdown on ammonium and iron concentrations in a coastal mountain reservoir	WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA												Part way through a year-long water quality field survey the Capilano Reservoir, located in the Greater Vancouver Water District, was drawn down to accommodate earthquake reinforcement work on the Cleveland Dam. This paper reports observations of the effect of drawdown on water quality in the reservoir, in the context of the original study. The drawdown exposed a large zone of deltaic material through which the Capilano River eroded a path up to 2.5 m deep. The deltaic material contained substantial amounts of nitrogen and iron (TKN, 4,470 mg . kg(-1); total iron, 21,800 mg . kg(-1)). During drawdown, turbidity in the reservoir increased up to 25 times as compared to prior conditions. Ammonium (NH4+-N) and dissolved and particulate iron concentrations in the drawdown zone were up to two orders of magnitude higher than concentrations upstream. Both NH4+-N and dissolved iron were observed to travel the length of the reservoir. Persistence of NH4+-N in the highly oxygenated conditions may be explained by the presence of factors that inhibit nitrification. Persistence of NH4+-N and particularly dissolved iron may be due to adsorption and complexation reactions. Seasonally high concentrations of iron and ammonium at the water intake corresponded to the timing of complaints of taste, odour, turbid water, and staining in the distribution system. Observations made during this extreme drawdown suggest that transport of N and Fe from exposed deltaic sediments may play a role in the periodic increases in ammonium and iron observed in the Capilano Reservoir. Further understanding of the impacts associated with changing reservoir elevation should lead to the development of appropriate management strategies to maintain the high quality of GVWD water.																			1201-3080						2000	35	2					231	244		10.2166/wqrj.2000.015	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wqrj.2000.015													WOS:000086614300005

Buffers were established in blocks around two of the wetlands in 1995. In 1997 and 1998, soil/water/plants were analyzed for nutrient content in the buffered and non buffered wetlands. Results showed that the wetland buffer vegetation effectively removed nutrients, thus reducing nutrient content in wetland soils and vegetation, and cycling captured nutrients through hay and forage crops. Long term budgets were developed for combinations of five wetland management scenarios and three crop farming systems. Net returns from buffered wetland fields were generally lower than net returns from maximum crop production. Net returns were greatest for the Wetland Reserve Program (WRP) or Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) scenarios, regardless of farming system. The results suggest that enrolling wetland in WRP or CRP has both economic and environmental benefits.																			0022-4561						2000	55	2					220	225																WOS:000088545000017
J	Speas, DW				Speas, DW			Zooplankton density and community composition following an experimental flood in the Colorado River, Grand Canyon, Arizona	REGULATED RIVERS-RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT												Zooplankton density and community composition were examined before and after an experimental flood (22 March-7 April 1996) in the Colorado River, Grand Canyon, north-central Arizona, USA, and comparisons were made across sampling locations and habitat types. The flood primarily affected longitudinal distribution and community composition of zooplankton. Prior to the flood, zooplankton density declined linearly below Lee's Ferry (R-2 = 0.79) but declined with the fourth power of distance downriver following the flood (R-2 = 0.59). Zooplankton community similarity indices between mainchannel and backwater habitats ranged from 0.08 to 0.89 prior to the flood but increased significantly to 0.64-0.98 after the flood, indicating increased homogeneity between habitat types. The flood displaced resident (i.e. benthic, littoral and/or phytophyllic) taxa from backwater habitats and replaced them with limnetic organisms. Total zooplankton density was greater after the flood (4174/m(3)) than before (2733/m(3)), but the increase may have been an artifact of normal seasonal cycles in the Colorado River and/or the upstream reservoir (Lake Powell).

Oxygen microelectrodes were used to study seasonal variations in oxygen concentration profiles at the sediment-water interface and to determine the oxygen consumption of the various sediment types. The maximum oxygen penetration depth was 4 and 2 mm in the littoral and profundal zone, respectively. The larvae of Cladotanytarsus mancus (littoral) and Tanytarsus bathophilus (littoral and profundal) inhabit the top layer of the sediment and, therefore, live close to the overlying oxygen-rich water. The larvae of Polydilum gr. bicrenatum, Stictochironomus sticticus (both littoral) and Chrinomus anthracinus (profundal) occur deeper in the sediment and are, therefore, surrounded by anoxic sediment. At comparable temperatures, the silty profundal sediments of L. Maarsseveen I consume three times as much oxygen as the sediment in the sandy littoral zone. The surface of the burrow of S. sticticus, depending on the temperature, consumes approximately the same amount as, or considerably less oxygen than the larva living in it, but the burrows of the Ch. anthracinus larvae consume approximately three times as much oxygen as the larvae. Ch. anthracinus larvae, therefore, live in a less favourable oxygen micro-environment than S. sticticus larvae, as they have to compete more for the available oxygen with the surrounding sediment. In general, no differences were found between the specific haemoglobin content of the larvae of superficial and deeper living species; size (biomass) of the larvae seems to be a more important factor (large larvae burrowing deeper). The exceptionally high haemoglobin content of the small larvae of P. gr. bicrenatum may be an adaptation to a life in the anoxic layers of the sediment.																			0003-9136					MAR	1994	130	1					53	67																WOS:A1994NB15100003

The most common varieties are 'Lapins', 'Bing', 'Newstar', 'Sweetheart', 'Stella', 'Sunburst' and 'Van' grafted on 'Mahalebl, 'Pontaleb', 'SL 64', 'Colt' or 'Mazzard' rootstocks. Trees generally are drip-irrigated and planted at high densities, using training systems such as Tatura, central leader and modified vase (2700, 1100 and 1000 trees ha(-1), respectively). Growers in Los Antiguos are more traditional, planting mainly as vase (400 to 1000 trees ha-1) or freestanding trees (280 trees ha(-1)) and irrigating by gravity (74% of the area). Only 4.4% of the area of Los Antiguos is frost protected, as growers rely strongly on the moderating effect of Lake Buenos Aires. Frost control systems are absent in Comodoro Rivadavia because the established orchards are located next to the sea, in an area with low risk of frost. The frost-protected area is 49% in Sarmiento, 35% in Esquel and 57% in LVCHR. Fruit are harvested from November (LVCHR) to the end of January (Los Antiguos and Esquel), and the harvest-only labour demand during the 2004/2005 season was 100,000 h. In that season, seven packinghouses exported 390 t (45% of the total production) to Europe. Most orchards have not yet reached their mature stage and new ones are being established. Therefore, fruit volumes will continue to increase and shortages of labour and packing facilities may become a constraint.

However, stormwater generally contains high pollutant levels, which may cause adverse effects on public health and the environment. Water quality in a stormwater retention pond in the City of Calgary, Alberta, was examined in order to assess the feasibility of reusing stormwater for irrigation purposes. Field campaigns were conducted in the 2004, 2005, and 2006 irrigation seasons. The water quality data indicated that the pond water quality generally satisfies the requirements for stormwater recycled as irrigation water. Relationships between stormwater quality and climatological variables were investigated using correlation and regression analysis. Their correlations suggest that intermittent rain events contribute to elevated microbial levels and total suspended solids (TSS). Other climatological variables-air temperature, cloud cover, wind speed, and relative humidity-are also correlated with certain water quality parameters including fecal coliform (FC), TSS, nutrients, and conductivity. Formulated regression equations demonstrate good predictions of observed FC and TSS using climatological variables. Results showing stormwater quality as a function of climatological variables imply that climate change might have potential influence on stormwater quality.					; Neumann, Norman/J-8310-2015	Valeo, Caterina/0000-0002-4056-8632; 													1201-3080						2008	43	2-3					145	159		10.2166/wqrj.2008.018	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wqrj.2008.018													WOS:000207849300007

Hydrological measurements were made once a week on the watercourse, and water samples for laboratory analyses were collected at two-month intervals at the sites of flow measurement. It was found that the mean concentrations of total phosphorus in the outflow from the catchment depended on the pattern and intensity of land use, and were higher in a drained agricultural catchment than in an afforested catchment. The total phosphorus concentrations were lower in the growing period than outside of this season. The phosphorus load carried away from the unit area of catchment depended on the land use pattern, being higher in the drained agricultural catchment (0.18 kg P (tot) . ha(-) 1 . year(-) 1) and lower in the afforested catchment (0.12 kg P (tot) . ha(-1) . year(-1)). The load of phosphorus delivered from the catchment per unit area of the reservoir surface (0.5 g . m(-2)) is almost 4 times heavier than the maximum allowable value, which results in accelerated eutrophication and accumulation processes. The reservoir forms a barrier that traps the phosphorus compounds running off from the catchment. The amount of P tot accumulated during the year 2006 in the reservoir basin was 21.5 kg (i.e. 0.86 kg P (tot) . ha(-1)), with most of it being retained in the growing period.																			1644-0765						2008	7	1					13	24																WOS:000421190500002
J	Ravera, O				Ravera, Oscar			An index for estimating the potential impact on the environment of the pollutant content in aquatic populations	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The so-called "Concentration factor" (C.F) should express a direct positive relationship between the concentration of a pollutant (e.g. metals, radioisotopes) in an organism and the concentration of the same pollutant in the water. While this index is very useful in some cases, it cannot give any information on the influence of the biota on its environment, an important topic in research on biogeochemical cycles. A new index (the Influence index) has consequently been developed to quantify the potential influence of the pollutant content in the population biomass on the habitat in which the population lives. The value of this index is calculated as the ratio between the pollutant content in the population biomass per sediment surface unit (e.g. m(2)) and the concentration of the same pollutant in the water and is expressed as water volume with the same pollutant concentration as in the water of the population habitat. The value increases with the increase of the pollutant content in the population biomass and the decrease of the pollutant concentration in the water. As an example, some applications of the index to heavy metal contaminations of a freshwater mussel (Unio pictorum mancus) population are described.																			1129-5767						2008	67	1					70	74		10.4081/jlimnol.2008.70	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2008.70													WOS:000258476000009

A combined method: Precipitation and capping, to attenuate eutrophication in Canadian lakes	CONTAMINATED SEDIMENTS: EVALUATION AND REMEDIATION TECHNIQUES	American Society for Testing and Materials Selected Technical Papers				3rd International Symposium on Contaminated Sediments	MAY 23-25, 2006	Shizuoka, JAPAN					Eutrophication is a natural phenomenon, unfortunately amplified and accelerated by human activities. Phosphorus and nitrogen are the principal nutrients responsible for eutrophication. Their excess in the environment, of domestic and agricultural origins, represents an important toxicological risk for the users of water. These excessive nutrients cause algae overgrowth and excess oxygen consumption, which leads to anoxic waters, production of toxins (such as those produced by cyanobacteria), and the production of pollutant gases. Excess nutrients and dead biomass settles at the bottom of the lake together with other trace contaminants such as toxic metals that are trapped within bottom sediments. Seasonally, the sediments release nutrients and contaminants that need to be mitigated in order to prevent eutrophication and overall water contamination. In Quebec and in Canada several lakes suffer from this problem and solutions have been divided in preventive practices (better runoff controls, protection of shores, elimination of leaking domestic septic tanks) and rehabilitating practices (oxygenation of water, precipitation of nutrients, dredging of sediments or capping). This paper will present recent advances in the development of a combined rehabilitating technique: Precipitation of phosphorous and capping of contaminated sediments. The paper includes: a recent literature review; phosphorous precipitation experiments using alum under optimized parameters; capping design considerations and theory; as well as the results of an experimental simulation of capping using a composite liner calcite/sand.					; allier, delphine/AAN-9624-2021	Allier, Delphine/0000-0002-6869-3451; Galvez, Rosa/0000-0001-7357-1582													0066-0558		0-8031-3408-8				2006	1482						232	+		10.1520/STP37691S	http://dx.doi.org/10.1520/STP37691S													WOS:000237609800024

Sediment storage and transfer in the Mekong: generalizations on a large river	SEDIMENT DYNAMICS AND THE HYDROMORPHOLOGY OF FLUVIAL SYSTEMS	IAHS Publication				Symposium on Sediment Dynamics and the Hydromorphology of Fluvial Systems	JUL 02-07, 2006	Dundee, SCOTLAND	Int Assoc Hydrol Sci, Int Commiss Continental Eros				Our knowledge regarding sediment transfer and storage by a large river is limited. The morphology of the Mekong. River and the physiography of its basin restrict sediment storage to its channel, or very close to it, for 4000 km, due to limited overbank accommodation space. Only for the last 600 km does the river move laterally to deposit sediment. This paper reviews: (a) the nature of sediment storage in the upper and middle Mekong; (b) sediment deposition in a wide flood basin in its lower course; (c) transfer of flood sediment into Tonle Sap Lake; and (d) the seasonal pattern of sediment collection, transfer and storage along the river and into the South China Sea. The discussion is based mainly on satellite imagery at various resolutions, hydrological information from the Mekong River Commission, and field visits. It is suggested that the sediment storage pattern and the volume stored in the Mekong can be extensively disturbed by anthropogenic environmental alteration, such as the ongoing series of dam construction in the upper reaches.

J	Koperski, P; Golub, M				Koperski, P; Golub, M			Application of new regional biotic index APODEMAC, in environmental quality assessment of lowland streams	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Four commonly employed biotic indices based on macrofauna composition: BMWP (British Monitoring Working Party score system), ASPT (Average Score Per Taxon), DSFI (Danish Stream Fauna Index) and FBI (Family level Biotic Index) were used to assess environmental quality of six small slow-flowing lowland streams (Masurian Lakeland, North-eastern Poland). Their efficiencies in determining the level of degradation, assessed by the simoultaneous measuring of the main abiotic parameters of water, were tested. The search for relationships between both abundance and percentages of invertebrate taxa and values of the main abiotic parameters with multiple regression analysis resulted in determining an indicative value for certain taxa. Results of discriminant function analysis show, that environmental quality can be predicted accurately on the basis of macrofauna composition in 94-100% of the sites. However, none of tested indices classified the sites to particular classes of degradation with sufficient accuracy. The relationships between the values of all tested indices and the values of Cumulative Index of Environmental Quality (CIEQ) based on abiotic parameters, expressed as coefficients of linear regression, were very low and ranged between 0.006 and 0.068. Therefore, a new regional, macrofauna-based biotic index, APODEMAC, is proposed as a better tool for environmental quality assessment. Values of APODEMAC are strongly dependent on values of CIEQ (R-2 = 0.641), and their seasonal variance is lower than that of other indices. Coefficient of linear regression between CIEQ values and APODEMAC was 9 to almost 100 times higher than for other tested biotic indices. The selection of indicator taxa used in APODEMAC procedure was based on comparisons between the taxa densities at sampling sites differing in terms of environmental quality and on the results of multiple regression and discriminant analysis. The importance of certain taxa of molluscs, leeches and dipterans in this procedure is much higher, while the importance of mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies is much lower than in BMWP, ASPT, FBI and DSFI. The occurrence of the various larval insects in the studied environments seems to be limited rather by substrate type than by the chemical quality of stream water. Application of simple regional biotic indices like APODEMAC is suggested as an, in some cases, easier, cheaper and less time-consuming way of biological assessment compared to complicated and time-consuming implementation of the existing indices.

Iron concentrations were measured for three size fractions: particulate iron (phi >0.22 mu m), colloidal iron (phi = 0.025-0.22 mu m) and soluble iron (phi < 0.025 mu m), and environmental factors (physicochemical and biological factors) were synchronously analyzed. Results showed that size-fractionated iron and the related environmental factors all varied with season. Colloidal iron accounted for only 5-9% of total iron, while particulate and soluble iron each accounted for 40-50% of total iron. The results suggested that size-fractionated iron can transform into each other, especially the highly reactive colloidal iron. Significant linear correlations were found between iron in different size fractions, and significant correlations were also obtained between chlorophyll a and environmental factors, such as TN, TP and secchi depth. No significant correlation between iron and chlorophyll a was found in this study.

J	Cohen, S; Stanhill, G				Cohen, S; Stanhill, G			Contemporary climate change in the Jordan Valley	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY					Jehuda Neumann Memorial Symposium on Mesoscale Modeling and Climate History	JAN 04-06, 1995	JERUSALEM, ISRAEL					This study examines the climate changes that have occurred in the 40 years since the publication of Jehuda Neumann's classic climatological studies of the energy and water balance of the natural water bodies of the Jordan Valley. The measurements analyzed in this paper were those made during the last half century at three rural sites in the Israel Meteorological Service's climate station network. They consist of 45-60 years of continuous records of daily minimum and maximum temperature, and rainfall and shorter, intermittent pairs of early and recent measurement series of global irradiance, which were available from nearby sites. Annual averages of minimum and maximum temperatures showed statistically significant decreases in mean annual maximum temperatures. These were -0.035 degrees C per year at Kfar Blum (north of the former Hula swamp), -0.024 degrees C per year at Degania A (on the southern shore of Lake Kinneret) and -0.018 degrees C per year at Sedom (near the southern shore of the Dead Sea). Minimum temperatures showed no significant change at Kfar Blum, decreased significantly at Degania by 0.011 degrees C per year and increased significantly by 0.024 degrees C per year at Sedom. The temperature trends showed a complex seasonal pattern. No significant changes in total annual rainfall or its interannual variance were found. Although much of the interannual variance in the temperature records could be explained by the large variations in annual rainfall, annual temperature trends remain unchanged after removal of the rainfall influence. Comparison of the three pairs of global irradiance measurement series made in the Jordan Valley during the 1960s and the 1980s indicates that a marked decrease in irradiance has accompanied the decreases in maximum temperatures, the decrease in irradiance being greatest at the cloudier sites and seasons. Cloud cover observations at Kfar Blum showed that this decrease in irradiance could not be explained by an increase in cloud cover. The results indicate that a significant reduction in atmospheric transmissivity has occurred in this region, possibly caused by the increased emissions of anthropogenic aerosols from the upwind industrialized coastal region of Israel and of Europe. Finally the consequences of the above changes for the agriculture and hydrology of the region are briefly discussed.

We analyzed the long-term variability in species composition and related plant biomass to environmental variables in a subtropical minerotrophic floating marsh, Louisiana, U.S.A. Panicum hemitomon was the dominant plant species, representing 76% of the total mean end of season aboveground dry weight of 840 g . m(-2). Multivariate analyses showed that community structure in the Lake Boeuf floating marsh has changed little during the 11 years included in this study. Individual species occurring in varying frequency with the dominant, Panicum hemitomon, form two marginally distinct assemblages. Mean live end of season biomass varied from a low of 602 g dry wt . m(-2) to a high of 1173 g dry wt . m(-2) during the period of the study. Ninety-nine percent of the variation in total aboveground biomass can be predicted by environmental variables related to temperature, precipitation, evaporation, and water level. Mapping of the area for the years 1945, 1952, 1981, and 1992 show that a net loss of about 4% of marsh has occurred between 1945 and 1992.

J	Primicerio, R				Primicerio, R			Size-dependent habitat choice in Daphnia galeata Sars and size-structured interactions among zooplankton in a subarctic lake (lake Lombola, Norway)	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Seasonal changes in vertical distribution of Daphnia galeata and other zooplankters were monitored in lake Lombola (69degrees07'N). Depth-habitat use, availability of edible algae and zooplankton densities were recorded to examine seasonal changes in intensity of competition between Daphnia and the other herbivores in the lake. Early in July, the exephippial generation of Daphnia aggregated near the surface, independently of body-size. In late July, when fish planktivory was expected to increase, the daphnids moved down during the day. In August, as intraspecific competition for food intensified, small and large Daphnia partitioned the water column, with larger individuals staying deeper. In September, Daphnia became dominated by large individuals, edible phytoplankton reached the seasonal minimum, and the vertical distribution of Daphnia gradually stretched out towards the surface. The observations on food availability and zooplankton densities suggest that interspecific competition intensified by the end of July. Species and stages that were most exposed to exploitative and interference competition by Daphnia were those staying deeper, because their vertical distribution overlapped more with the larger, competitively superior daphnids. These susceptible competitors included Keratella cochlearis and Synchaeta, among the rotifers, and nauplii and early copepodite stages of Cyclops scutifer. Depth-habitat use is discussed in relation to copepod development, zooplankton dynamics and predator-mediated coexistence.																			1386-2588	1573-5125				APR	2003	37	2					107	122		10.1023/A:1023942931825	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1023942931825													WOS:000183124600001

The Sacramento River watershed and YB are a source of methylmercury (MeHg) to downstream habitat as a result of historic mercury (Hg) and gold mining practices. In the dry season, the YB is extensively farmed and grazed. However, depending on the water year, the floodplain may remain inundated for months. Our experiments focused on the role of pasture land and decomposing vegetation as a source of MeHg during extensive periods of floodplain flooding. Decomposing vegetation, rather than sediment, was identified as the principal source of filter passing MeHg (fMeHg) within the floodplain. The decomposing vegetation provided a substrate for microbial methylation of inorganic Hg contained within the plants. In replicated flooded mesocosm experiments, MeHg concentrations increased from 2.78 to 31.0 ng g-1 dw and 3.41 to 56.8 ng g-1 dw in decomposing vegetation. In field collections, the concentrations of MeHg in vegetation increased from preflood levels of 2.78 to 45.4 ng g-1 dw after 17 weeks of flooding. The importance of vegetation was shown in laboratory experiments where there was a positive correlation between the amount of fMeHg in water and the amount of vegetation added. These results also provide Hg concentration data for an important functional type of vegetation, grasses, and fill a data gap that contributed to uncertainties with regards to the role of vegetation in Hg cycling.

The changes in microbial quality were followed as microbial numbers and growth activity. The filtration decreased microbial counts and growth ([H-3]thymidine technique) in water up to 90%. The reduction in bacterial counts and growth depended on the filtration distance. The reduction was greatest between the lake and the first sampling point. Microbial numbers and growth declined steadily after infiltration with increased filtration distance. Viable counts of heterotrophic bacteria decreased faster than total bacterial counts along filtration. The microbial numbers and bacterial production in water followed seasonal changes in water temperature. Simultaneously with the microbial numbers, the concentrations of total organic carbon and assimilable organic carbon decreased during bank filtration. These results showed that microbial stability of humus-rich water was increased by filtration to a level generally found in natural groundwaters.

The water samples were taken from five locations (Makhdomyari, Vintage, Ashtang, Matlab, and Ningle) for 3 years, viz., 2019, 2020, and 2021. The results of various physiochemical parameters during the entire study showed that the water quality of Wulur Lake has deteriorated due to the increased growth of macrophytes. The correlation analysis found significant positive and negative correlations between the studied parameters: temperature, depth, transparency, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen (D.O.), chloride, total alkalinity, hardness, calcium, nitrogen, phosphorus, and magnesium content. The principal component analysis (P.C.A.) demonstrated the most excellent match among the various physiochemical parameters, with two principal components explaining 63.5%, 63.8%, and 64.1% of the observed data variability in the sampling years 2019, 2020, and 2021 respectively. The Lake is becoming eutrophic, as evidenced by the low D.O. levels, increased nitrate-nitrogen and total phosphorus, high magnesium values, conductivity, total alkalinity, hardness, and calcium hardness. The Lake will likely continue to worsen and eventually become eutrophic if proper conservation measures are not implemented.

J	MILLHAM, NP; HOWES, BL				MILLHAM, NP; HOWES, BL			FRESH-WATER FLOW INTO A COASTAL EMBAYMENT - GROUNDWATER AND SURFACE-WATER INPUTS	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Freshwater discharge to a shallow coastal embayment was measured with two upland hydrologic and three embayment physical methods for 2 yr. Parallel measurements from the five methods ranged from 3,900 (+/-630) to 9,400 (+/-3,400) m(3) d(-1), and four of the methods showed close agreement and averaged 4,800 (+/-670) m(3) d(-1). The most precise estimate of discharge was from a chloride balance, while the best understanding of the rate and pattern of groundwater flow was from a Darcian streamtube approach. Groundwater dominated the freshwater budget, accounting for >95% of the total annual input, and was partitioned almost equally between direct seepage to embayment waters and seepage to a stream with final discharge via surface Bow. Freshwater inputs decreased rapidly toward the mouth of the estuary and >80% entered into the upper half. The lack of fixed watershed boundaries resulted in large errors in both the location and area of the topographically defined watershed when compared to a watershed defined by water-table mapping. Seasonal variations were found in both the boundaries of the watershed (8%) and in groundwater discharge (6-fold) in response to changing water-table gradients due to recharge. Hydrologic alterations of the upland through the import of water and the increased recharge from impermeable surfaces led to an apparent increase in the total freshwater discharge to the embayment of nearly 50% over ''natural'' levels.																			0024-3590					DEC	1994	39	8					1928	1944		10.4319/lo.1994.39.8.1928	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1994.39.8.1928													WOS:A1994QG41300014

In this study, future changes in the extreme floods and their hydrodynamic responses are projected by driving the external coupling of the hydrological and hydrodynamic models using the precipitation and temperature outputs of the general circulation models (GCMs) in seven emission scenarios, and the impact of climate change is evaluated. The Baiyangdian Lake and its controlled catchment are selected as our study area. Results show that: (a) both the daily runoff and the lake water levels are well simulated, (b) compared with the baseline scenario, extreme riverine floods are projected to increase evidently throughout the catchment with mean rates of 33.2%, 14.1% and 10.9% in the RCP2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, respectively because of increasing precipitation; consequently, the total lake inflow also increases by 13.5%-150.9%, most of which are from Zhulong, Xiaoyi, Tanghe, and Fuhe Rivers, and (c) the water level of the Baiyangdian Lake increases temporally during the flood seasons in all the scenarios, and the increase in water level is 0.27-1.29 m greater than that in the baseline scenario; consequently, the water depth in 55.8% and 73.4% of lake area increases over 1.0 m in the future short-term and long-term scenarios, respectively; the inundation area also increases by 23.4%-26.7% in the future scenarios, except in the long-term RCP4.5 scenario. The northeastern and south-central regions of Baiyangdian, which are near Xiong'an New Area, have a relatively high inundation risk.

Assessment of light history indicators for predicting seagrass biomass	21ST INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION (MODSIM2015)					21st International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM) held jointly with the 23rd National Conference of the Australian-Society-for-Operations-Research / DSTO led Defence Operations Research Symposium (DORS	NOV 29-DEC 04, 2015	Gold Coast, AUSTRALIA	BMT WBM, CSIRO, UNSW Australia Canberra, Griffith Univ, Deltares, Modelling & Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand, Australian Soc Operat Res, DSTO, Gold Coast Tourism Corp				Seagrasses are rapidly declining worldwide due to anthropogenic impacts on coastal environments. One major contributor to seagrass loss is the degradation of water quality which reduces light availability. In this paper we use a data-driven approach to compare several indicators of light history for their ability to predict seagrass biomass. Data sets for daily light and seasonal biomass of seagrass (Zostera muelleri) meadows from two lakes (Lake Macquarie and Tuggerah Lake) in New SouthWales, Australia, were analysed. The light history indicators were compared to seagrass biomass, for different periods of light history. Three indicators were tested: (1) an unweighted mean of the light history, (2) a weighted mean of the light history that places greater emphasis on the more recent light doses, and (3) a modified rolling average of light history. For the time periods that maximised the correlation between seagrass biomass and light history (hereafter called the optimised light history periods), the relationships between seagrass biomass and the three measures of light history always showed high significance (p < 0.05) but low predictive power (R-2 < 0.5). Our results consistently demonstrated that there was a significant and positive relationship between light history and biomass at the optimised light history periods. However, light availability was clearly not the only factor influencing seagrass biomass in the two lakes studied. The best correlations were identified for total and below-ground biomass in Lake Macquarie (R-2 = 0.47-0.49, p<0.0001); this was attributed to the high below-ground to aboveground biomass ratio and lesser influence of sediment and nutrient conditions in Lake Macquarie compared to Tuggerah Lake. All three light history indicators yielded similar correlations between biomass and light history (maximum variation in R-2 was 0.05). Indicator 1 was slightly better than the other two because it produced higher R2 values and lower p-values. Indicator 1 was also easier to calculate than indicator 2 and requires a shorter time period of daily light data to optimise than indicator 2. Indicator 3 is ideally suited for use as a tracer in large-scale modelling simulations, and thus may be used in these simulations if indicator 1 cannot be easily calculated. Hence we generally recommend indicator 1, although indicator 3 may also be suitable in some circumstances. For these two indicators, 1.5-8 months of daily light data was required to optimise the correlation between biomass and light history for the seagrass Z. muelleri in Lake Macquarie and Tuggerah Lake. These time periods provide an upper limit on the time that this seagrass species should be subjected to light deprivation before management actions are triggered.

S	Botha, G		Grab, S; Knight, J		Botha, Greg			The Maputaland Corridor: A Coastal Geomorphological Treasure	LANDSCAPES AND LANDFORMS OF SOUTH AFRICA	World Geomorphological Landscapes											Maputaland represents the southern limit of the east African coastal plain, flanked by the volcanic Lebombo mountain cuesta and the high-energy Indian Ocean. The terrain morphology of the region bears testimony to deep erosional incision and dramatic sea-level fluctuations since the early Cretaceous. The topography of the coastal plain is closely linked to the sequence of aeolian sand deposits that have been differentially weathered and eroded. The late Neogene shoreline has been exploited by the Phongola River. Under the Tshongwe-Sihangwane sand megaridge and the wetland systems towards the east, the truncated dune landscape of the Kosi Bay Formation perches groundwater, providing groundwater seepage and seasonal run-off to the coastal lakes. The extended parabolic dune systems of the KwaMbonambi Formation define the surface relief and confine interdune wetlands. The coastal lakes have evolved in response to Pleistocene sea-level fluctuations that have inundated river valleys up to 25 km inland and caused foredunes to be submerged several kilometres offshore on the shelf. Accretion of the high coastal barrier dune cordon during the Holocene isolated some coastal lakes and forced morphological changes in others. Management of this area with international conservation status must draw from the dramatic influences that geomorphic processes have had on this region.

In order to assess the water quality, a total of eight running water resources were sampled within four different seasons and two lakes were sampled at dry and wet seasons in 2008-2009. While some water resources were found to have high quality levels for some physico-chemical findings, the results were also supported by using EPT (Ephemeroptera Plecoptera Trichoptera) index. Furthermore, the cluster analysis, correspondence analysis, and Pearson correlation index were used to determine the relationships between the data. As a result, although a lot of sampled water resources that feed into the National Park area has been found to have good quality level, it was also observed that the area have been under the negative effects of humans. Therefore, at the end of this study, it was also made some suggestions for sustainable usage of this special area.					; ÖTERLER, Burak/F-2217-2017	OTERLER, BURAK/0000-0002-9064-1666; 													0188-8897						2015	25	2					231	237																WOS:000377254200009

Socio-economic Dimension of Snow and Glacier Melt in the Nepal Himalayas	DYNAMICS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND WATER RESOURCES OF NORTHWESTERN HIMALAYA	Society of Earth Scientists Series				Dynamics of Climate Change and Water Resources of Northwestern Himalaya	FEB 27-28, 2012	AG, SWITZERLAND					A mass balance analysis of the glaciers in the Nepal Himalayas has revealed that there have been accelerated retreats of glaciers causing widespread adverse impacts on the ecosystem, environment and economy in Nepal. The decreasing water storage in the mountain due to snow and glacier melt has created additional threats to already fragile and vulnerable mountain communities. The people and ecosystem in the mountain and foot hills are already under immense pressure from growing economic development. Climate change is putting additional pressure on the lives and livelihoods of the mountain people and on the ecosystem they depend upon. Studies have revealed that the majority of the glaciers in Nepal Himalayas are already retreating so rapidly that even without any further warming; most of them will disappear by the end of this century. This may result in decreased melt-water contribution to total water availability, particularly during dry seasons. The hydropower and irrigation sector, which are already under stress during non-monsoon seasons, will be badly affected. Though the annual decrease in per capita water availability due to warming may not be very much significant, the seasonal effect of the warming particularly during non-monsoon season is substantial. This will have major adverse impact to economy and society of Nepal. Particularly, the poor, marginalized, subsistence farmers and those living on natural system will face the largest adverse impact.																			2194-9204		978-3-319-13743-8; 978-3-319-13742-1				2015							191	199		10.1007/978-3-319-13743-8_15	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-13743-8_15													WOS:000380546200015

In this study, seven sampling points were selected and environmental parameters including lagoon water (pH, electrolytic conductivity), sediment and soil of the littoral zone (pH, electrolytic conductivity, texture, shell content, total carbon and nitrogen concentrations) were measured and the effects of high salinity on the total C, total N, and C/N ratio in different organs of Phragmites australis were discussed. According to the electrolytic conductivity results, our sampling sites can be considered as highly saline environments. Texture analyses have indicated that the sediment and soil samples were mostly sandy with a high sensitivity to pollution discharges. Highest N concentrations were measured in the leaves of Phragmites with an increasing order in the urban, agricultural and industrial sampling sites (1.73-3.29%). N inputs into the highly saline Kucukcekmece Lagoon can be associated with different pollution sources and the observed Phragmites australis stands may be favourable for the natural elimination of N in this area.

Between September 2005 and August 2006, fish were collected monthly from mattresses of aquatic macrophytes. Biometric measurements as well as macroscopic and microscopic analyses of the gonads were performed. Standard body lengths ranged from 2.4 to 9.3 cm, and weight-length relationships were indicative of isometric growth patterns. Reproduction events were detected in all months, but the gonadosomatic index indicated a reproductive season from October to February (during low and rising water periods), reaching a reproductive peak in February. Average fecundity was 1184 +/- 40.82 (mean +/- SD) mature oocytes. M. insignis exhibits an asynchronous oocytal development, characteristic of multiple spawnings. Morphological and histological analyses indicated 5 gonadal maturation stages for females. Average standard length at first sexual maturation was 5.18 cm for females and 5.5 cm for males. M. insignis shows late sexual maturation. Taken together, these aspects suggest that a life history strategy of 'equilibrium' predominates in the species; consequently, M. insignis can be considered vulnerable to high extraction rates, and can only be exploited sustainably if adequate precautionary management procedures are adopted. Some management measures are suggested for the exploitation of this species in the Central Amazon.

The species presents a protracted spawning season that last 8 months. Both small and large females start spawning activity in July, but this is females size-dependent. The female length at 50 % maturity based on histological procedures was 27.3 cm, which differs from the ones previously reported based on the gonad macroscopic observations (34.9 cm). The present study indicates that B. guatemalensis has determinate fecundity and group-synchronous type ovarian organization. The studies of the potential annual fecundity of the species show that this allometrically increases above three with female size, indicating that larger females produce more eggs than predicted by weight. These results can be incorporated in the current fishery management to promote sustainability.

In addition, the pattern of phytoplankton variation and interaction between chlorophyll a and environmental variables are important for eutrophication management. To understand general water environment characteristics, including relationships between chlorophyll a and environmental variables in the Taige Canal-Taihu Lake system, a comparative study was conducted based on a two-year-long field investigation. This system was divided into a river region and a lake region based on cluster analysis. Investigated field data in the two regions were analyzed separately with principal component analysis (PCA) and stepwise multiple regressions for the relationships among water quality parameters. The spatial variation between the two regions can be found both in patterns of water quality parameters and relationships among them. Multivariate analysis showed that total phosphorous, chlorophyll a, and transparency were the main indicators of the spatial variations between the two regions. Relationships among water quality parameters showed that temperature and transparency were the primary environmental factors limiting phytoplanIcton growth in the river region. However, in the lake region phytoplankton may uptake phosphorus from sediments and its growth was limited by nitrogen during high-temperature seasons. Based on these characteristics, we suggested that reduction of nitrogen input and control of internal phosphorous loading was important for management of eutrophication in the studied area.					jing, liandong/AAO-2364-2021; Xiong, Xiong/GQQ-8712-2022; Huang, Xiaolong/HGA-0958-2022; Wu, Chenxi/O-7689-2016														1230-1485	2083-5906					2015	24	3					1031	1039																WOS:000355575900012

The specific activity of Sr-90 and Cs-137 for 17 species of fish, concerning various ecological groups was estimated. The fish of stagnant water bodies of the Chernobyl exclusion zone continue to be characterized by the high concentration of Sr-90 and Cs-137. Radionuclide specific activity in fish of closed water bodies of the Chernobyl exclusion zone during our studies in all cases exceeded maximal permissible levels, according to the standards, accepted in Ukraine for fish production: in 53-2892 times on Sr-90 and in 6-212 times on Cs-137. In fish of the riverbed sites of the Pripyat River within the Chernobyl exclusion zone some single cases which exceeded the maximal permissible level on Cs-137, mainly the predatory fish, were registered. The analysis of radionuclide specific activity data in fish of various size, weight and age groups on an example of the common rudd and the European perch from Glubokoye Lake has allowed revealing a dependence of Sr-90 and Cs-137 accumulation on the weight of body and the age of fishes.					; Shevtsova, Nataliia/AAM-9093-2020; Gudkov, Dmitri/D-1111-2017	Pomortseva, Nataliia/0009-0009-9023-0750; Gudkov, Dmitri/0000-0002-5304-7414; Shevtsova, Nataliia/0000-0003-4680-8454															978-86-80300-01-6				2015							249	252																WOS:000387979700053

It is unknown what influences the population structuring of these chemotypes. Sediment cores from seven lakes in southern Norway allowed temporal reconstruction of chemotype diversity from sites where there is only fragmented historical information. Sediment DNA was amplified using primers designed to specify the chemotype variations found within the cyanopeptoline ociB gene cluster. Findings indicate that of the seven lakes studied, only two lakes had Planktothrix populations containing all four of the most common Norwegian chemotypes. We used principal component analysis and Kendall tau analysis to investigate the ability of monitoring data to predict chemotype diversity, and to identify possible biotic or abiotic barriers to chemotype dispersal. The best predictor was a negative relationship between number of chemotypes present in a lake and the concentration of chlorophyll a in the top 0-4 m. At low chlorophyll a concentrations, light penetration is typically deeper, which could allow light tolerant Planktothrix to move deeper into the colder waters. Recent research findings have suggested this allows for a window of opportunity for Planktothrix to escape parasitism. With this added cold, light-constrained niche, more chemotypes might find refuge. The resulting increase in chemotype diversity within Planktothrix populations could present a greater defense against parasitism when conditions varied, such as by seasonal light changes.																			2296-701X						2015	3								104	10.3389/fevo.2015.00104	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2015.00104													WOS:000485318800112

In this study, three typical wetland ecosystems (city secondary wetland, artificial wetland (paddy soil), and lake-wetland) in a subtropical mon-soon climate zone were selected as research objects. We simulated the decomposition process of soil organic matter under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. CO2 and CH4 emission fluxes, as well as other indicators such as soil organic carbon (SOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N), and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) were measured during laboratory culture. SUVA(254) was established as an index to represent the aromatic degree of DOC. Experimental results showed that According to the wetland hydrology-type classification, the cumulative CO2 emission from seasonal waterlogged wetlands (2457-3505 ugCO(2)/g) was significantly higher than that from perennial water soil (1124-1576 ugCO(2)/g) and soil without water (1226-1414 ugCO(2)/g). The amount of CH4 emitted from paddy soils under anaerobic condition (25.1-28.1 ugCH(4)/g) was higher than that from the other two types of wetlands (0.35-2.97 ugCH(4)/g). Moreover, the oxide rate was correspondingly higher. Compared with CO2 emission, CH4 flux was minimal. Most organic matter was anaerobically oxidized under anaerobic condition. The CO2 emission rate exhibited a significant positive correlation with SOC and TN contents. The effect of the content and structure of DOC was also analyzed. CO2 emission rate was reciprocally correlated with the humification degree of DOC under aerobic conditions, but this correlation was weak under anaerobic conditions. CH4 emission rate was also proportional to the CO2 emission rate and SOC content.					he, yun/JMB-6362-2023														1018-4619	1610-2304					2015	24	9A					2879	2887																WOS:000363072300002

Various types of association of coal and oil shale can be found in one basin, for instance, the coal can act as the roof or floor or interlayer of the oil shale, etc. The most crucial factor for the formation of oil shale is stratification and seasonal blooming of lower plankton, while the final formation of the coal still needs a hypoxia restored deposition environment. We take Huangxian and Fushun basins as typical examples to study the coal and oil shale sedimentary mechanisms controlled by the boundary fault. We found that the sedimentary mechanisms are different in different stages during the process of basin evolution. In the early stage, the association of coal and oil shale with thinner layers can be found. In the late part of early stage, thick layer coal seams and oil shale can be formed because of the relative stable faults. In the middle stage, thicker oil shale can be formed in deep lake and thicker coal seams can be formed in the lacustrine shore. In the late stage of basin evolution, the association of thickest coal seams and oil shale can be formed as the stable tectonic environment. Compared with the depression basin, more active fault and short cycle subsidence controlled by the episodic tectonic movements are the obvious characteristics. Higher rate of tectonic subsidence and a vast difference between sedimentary (peat-bearing) supply rate and accommodation space change rate are in favor of forming oil shale, and slower rate of tectonic subsidence is favor of forming coal. The study found that faulted structures obviously control the development, thickness and distribution characteristics of oil shale and coal. As mentioned above, the episodic tectonic movement of continental rift basin controls the types and filling and evolution of deposits.

Five levels of angling effort and catch at the 35 lakes were simulated, and effort varied from 3,278 to 68,741 h and catch varied from 1,737 to 50,525 fish over the duration of the season. Access-access creel surveys had an average of 32% relative error and roving-access surveys had an average of 17% relative error in estimates of aggregate (i.e., at all 35 lakes) angling effort and catch when one creel surveyor was used. Estimates were relatively robust to temporal and spatial changes in patterns of effort and catch rate over the duration of the season. Relative error was inversely related to the amount of angling effort, catch, and creel surveyors. Roving-access surveys outperformed access-access surveys at all levels of sampling effort. Bias and relative error of estimates of angling effort and catch were greater at the individual-lake scale than when estimates were derived for all 35 lakes. Results of this study suggest that on-site surveys can provide relatively accurate estimates of angling effort and catch at as many as 35 lakes with minimal sampling effort.																			0275-5947	1548-8675					2015	35	6					1152	1163		10.1080/02755947.2015.1088490	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2015.1088490													WOS:000368622800008

Dietary Habits and Distribution of Some Fish Species in the Pansipit River-Lake Taal Connection, Luzon Island, Philippines	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												The interface between lakes and their outlet rivers is an interesting research site for fish community dynamics because it is immediately exposed to disturbances in lake ecosystems. In this paper, observations on the species composition, dietary habits and distribution of fish in the upstream area of Pansipit River - sole outlet of Lake Taal, were presented Fish samples comprised of juvenile fish from 12 species, including four that were introduced These non-native species were more abundant than native fish caught. Dietary analyses suggest that non-native fish have a wider dietary breadth compared to native fish and may be one reason why introduced fish populations have exceeded native fish populations in the area. Fish activity varied depending on time of day in certain sub-sites and these fishes aggregated in intermittent deep pools when water depth is uniformly low in the river during the dry season. These suggest that fish abundance in the area is associated with river water depth and other environmental factors. Overall, the study stresses the need for more in-depth research in Pansipit River given its importance as a migratory path and its potential as a refugia for the riverine fish community.					; Briones, Jonathan Carlo/KHV-7571-2024; Papa, Rey Donne/AES-4252-2022	Briones, Jonathan Carlo/0000-0003-1129-4000; 													0119-1144						2015	18	2					1	9																WOS:000367696800001

As nitrate (NO3-) concentration changes in fresh waters have been used to describe biogeochemical and hydrological processes in and between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, we monitored nitrate (NO3-) concentrations on the river Ledava and its associated reservoir Ledavsko jezero bi-weekly between June 2013 and January 2014. The results showed the importance of continuous and simultaneous water monitoring of the river and its associated reservoir to indicate processes and parameters which influence NO3- dynamics in reservoir. Significant correlations were found between precipitation, discharge and nitrate concentrations. The prevailing influence ofriverine inflow to the reservoir and the loose correlation between nitrate concentration and discharge in the reservoir indicate that river inflow is subjected to biogeochemical processes within the reservoir relative to season and hydraulic retention time as the latter increases with low flow. Through an analysis of data this study shows that nitrate concentration changes in the reservoir are strongly dependent on riverine inflow, season dependent processes and reservoir operation regime.

The city, which previously provided only chlorination for their surface water sources added filtration in addition to chlorination. To assess whether Cryptosporidium infections rates declined following filtration, we tested serological responses to 15/17-kDa and 27-kDa Cryptosporidium antigens among 107 community college students 1 month before and 225 students 5 months after filtration. Results suggest that levels of Cryptosporidium infections did not decline following water filtration. However, seasonal changes in other exposures may have confounded the findings. Swimming in a lake, stream or public pool and drinking untreated water from a lake or stream predicted a more intense response to one or both markers. Residence in the city, not drinking city tap water or drinking bottled water, gender, travel or exposure to pets, young pets, diapers or a household child in day care were not found to be predictive of more or less intense serological responses for either the 15/17-kDa and 27-kDa antigen.																			0950-2688					AUG	2000	125	1					87	92		10.1017/S0950268899004148	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0950268899004148								11057963					WOS:000090109000012

Extreme seasonal water-level changes and hydraulic modeling of deep, high-altitude, glacial-carved, Himalayan lakes	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Himalayan lakes represent critical water resources, culturally important waterbodies, and potential hazards. Some of these lakes experience dramatic water-level changes, responding to seasonal monsoon rains and post-monsoonal draining. To address the paucity of direct observations of hydrology in retreating mountain glacial systems, we describe a field program in a series of high altitude lakes in Sagarmatha National Park, adjacent to Ngozumba, the largest glacier in Nepal. In situ observations find extreme (>12 m) seasonal water-level changes in a 60-m deep lateral-moraine-dammed lake (lacking surface outflow), during a 16-month period, equivalent to a 5 x 10(6) m(3) volume change annually. The water column thermal structure was also monitored over the same period. A hydraulic model is constructed, validated against observed water levels, and used to estimate hydraulic conductivities of the moraine soils damming the lake and improves our understanding of this complex hydrological system. Our findings indicate that lake level compared to the damming glacier surface height is the key criterion for large lake fluctuations, while lakes lying below the glacier surface, regulated by surface outflow, possess only minor seasonal water-level fluctuations. Thus, lakes adjacent to glaciers may exhibit very different filling/draining dynamics based on presence/ absence of surface outflows and elevation relative to retreating glaciers, and consequently may have very different fates in the next few decades as the climate warms.																			2045-2322					JUL 20	2023	13	1							11705	10.1038/s41598-023-37667-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-37667-z								37474526					WOS:001034058100066

Waterfowl populations decline with nutrient reduction and increase with nutrient restoration: 20 years of adaptive management at a Ramsar-listed wastewater treatment plant	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus are typically considered detrimental to wetland values, but waterfowl can be numerous on nutrient-rich wetlands. Waterfowl were counted three to six times per year on nine treatment lagoons and associated wetlands (2,025 ha) at the Western Treatment Plant (south-east Australia) from 2000, to help maintain ecological values of this Ramsar-listed wetland as well as treating sewage for a large city (Melbourne). Up to 185,000 waterfowl were counted, varying with season, continental rainfall and lagoon operation. Nutrient levels were reduced on Lake Borrie lagoon in 2005 (as part of an Environmental Improvement Program) and restored in 2015. Waterfowl declined on Lake Borrie lagoon from 2005 when it received treated effluent not raw sewage, and increased in 2015 when it received partially treated sewage. This pattern was highly significant for total waterfowl and most species and guilds at Lake Borrie but was not replicated on other lagoons. Modelling revealed positive relationships between waterfowl numbers and nutrient concentrations, including ammonia and nitrite, to moderate levels. This shows that with careful management nutrient enrichment can have positive benefits, allowing artificial wetlands such as wastewater treatment plants to support high densities of waterbirds and the food webs that sustain them.					; Menkhorst, Peter/HGC-5722-2022	Loyn, Richard/0000-0002-7337-0518; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2023	850	19					4127	4147		10.1007/s10750-023-05265-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-023-05265-9		JUL 2023											WOS:001032078700003
J	PATTERSON, G; WILSON, KK				PATTERSON, G; WILSON, KK			THE INFLUENCE OF THE DIEL CLIMATIC CYCLE ON THE DEPTH-TIME DISTRIBUTION OF PHYTOPLANKTON AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN A SHALLOW EQUATORIAL LAKE (LAKE BARINGO, KENYA)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lake Baringo is a shallow equatorial lake. This paper reports a diel study of the depth-time distribution of phytoplankton and photosynthesis at one location in Lake Baringo on 10 March 1989. The water column shows a pattern of diurnal stratification probably accentuated by the high turbidity of the water and therefore rapid attenuation of solar energy. This stratified pattern breaks down at night due to atmospheric cooling and the regular onset of winds in the early evening. The phytoplankton is dominated by Microcystis aeruginosa with some associated epiphytes. It concentrates in the narrow euphotic zone during the diurnal period of stratification due to buoyancy of the Microcystis; evening breakdown of the thermocline results in the phytoplankton being mixed throughout the water column. A series of measurements of photosynthesis throughout the diurnal period gives an areal rate of 3.8 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1). The relationship between this value and the level of fish exploitation in Lake Baringo is discussed. The diel cycle in Lake Baringo is interpreted as dominating over any seasonal limnological cycle in the lake.																			0018-8158					MAY 5	1995	304	1					1	8		10.1007/BF02530698	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02530698													WOS:A1995RD41500001
J	VINCENT, WF; HOWARDWILLIAMS, C				VINCENT, WF; HOWARDWILLIAMS, C			NITRATE-RICH INLAND WATERS OF THE ROSS ICE SHELF REGION, ANTARCTICA	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Nutrient and major ion concentrations were measured in surface water samples from lakes, ponds and streams at sites 30-320 km south of McMurdo Sound: the Darwin Glacier region (79.7-80.0-degrees-S), Pyramid Trough in the southern Dry Valleys (78.2-degrees-S), and the McMurdo Ice Shelf ablation zone (77.8-78.4-degrees-S). These aquatic environments ranged from dilute meltwaters (conductivity < 0.05 mS cm-1) to concentrated brines (> 50 mS cm-1). The lowest nitrate concentrations were recorded at the sites closest to the seasonally open waters of the Ross Sea. Much higher values (100-142000 mg NO3--Nm-3) were recorded at sites further south. These observations support the hypothesis that NO3-precipitation over Antarctica is of stratospheric rather than coastal marine origin. The nitrogen-rich waters contained chloride and nitrate in the ratio 5.45 g Cl : 1 g N (C.V. = 8.4%) which is within the range for Antarctic snow, and indicative of nitrate enrichment by freeze concentration processes. Cyanobacterial mats were conspicuous elements of the biota across the full range of salinities, and were usually dominated by oscillatoriacean species. Nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria and diatoms were also represented in these benthic microbial communities at the more northern sites, but were absent from all samples from the Darwin Glacier region.

The youngest mature male was age 7 with a standard length (SL) of 172.0 mm, and the youngest mature female was age 8 with a SL of 194.0 mm. The L(50)s Of SL and age at first maturity were respectively 250.32 mm and age 9 for males and 224.71 mm and age 8 for females. The gonadosomatic index (GSI) significantly changed with seasons for mature individuals but not for immature individuals. GSIs of mature females at stages IV and V of ovary development increased with SL and reached a maximum value at the SL range from 370 mm to 390 mm; the GSIs of mature males were negatively correlated with SL. The breeding season lasted from early April to early August. Egg size did not significantly change with SL but increased with the delay of spawning. The individual absolute fecundity varied from 1,341 to 28,002 eggs (mean 12,607+/-7,349), and the individual relative fecundity varied from 6.4 to 42.0 eggs.g(-1) (mean 25.5+/-9.7). The individual fecundity increased with total body weight; it also increased with SL for those of SL less than 370 mm.

Radios were retained for a mean of 40 days (0123 d; 73 adult birds radio-tagged). Comparisons of daily habitat use were made for birds in the morning, day, evening, and night. Most birds showed strong evidence of selective habitat use. Adults preferred the terrestrial vegetation (88%), and avoided the lake and wetlands during the day. At night, 63% of the birds selected the lake and wetlands. Nocturnal habitat use differed significantly between the non-breeding and breeding seasons, while the lake and wetland habitats were used more frequently during the non-breeding season. Most individuals showed strong site fidelity during the study, but habitat selection varied between individuals. Mean home range size was 9.78 ha (SE +/- 2.6) using the fixed kernel estimator (95% kernel; 15 birds, each with > 25 locations). The average minimum convex polygon size was 24 ha (SE +/- 5.6). The mean distance traveled between tracking locations was 178 in (SE +/- 30.5), with travel distances between points ranging tip to 1,649 in. Tracking duration varied from 31-121 days per bird (mean tracking duration 75 days).																			1524-4695					JUN	2004	27	2					183	192		10.1675/1524-4695(2004)027[0183:HUAHRO]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/1524-4695(2004)027[0183:HUAHRO]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000222000900009

Young ayu born in Lake Biwa were used as the experimental fish. In 1991, the experiment was started one month before the usual spawning season using ayu with gonadosomatic index (GSI) of 8.0% in male and 9.0% of female, but in 1992 entirely immature ayu with GSI below than 0.1% in both sexes were used. They were fed three different test diets: i.e., 0.1% tryptophan (TRP), 0.1% p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA; depleter of serotonin) diet or control. In the group fed the diet containing TRP, the peak of serum testosterone level and timing of spermiation were advanced in males and the final maturation for females was accelerated. Whereas, in ayu fed the diet with PCPA, suppression of serum testosterone levels and the delay in the timing of spermiation were noted in males, and in females lowering of serum estradiol-17 beta and the delay in the final maturation were observed. Thus, it is estimated that dietary TRP is involved in the maturation, being intermediated by serotonin. Moreover, these findings indicate the possibility that fish maturation can be controlled by not only injection or implanting of sexual hormones but also by oral administration of TRP, one of essential amino acid in fish.																			0919-9268					OCT	1996	62	5					776	782		10.2331/fishsci.62.776	http://dx.doi.org/10.2331/fishsci.62.776													WOS:A1996VX44900020
J	LESACK, LFW				LESACK, LFW			SEEPAGE EXCHANGE IN AN AMAZON FLOODPLAIN LAKE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Exchange of water between the lake and the surrounding groundwater system was computed for a permanent lake on the central Amazon floodplain (Lake Calado) from an empirical seepage model incorporating 240 direct measurements of seepage from the lakebed and seasonal changes in lake stage and morphometry. Seepage rates varied with the daily rate of change in stage height and inversely with depth of the lakebed from the water surface. Since the hypsometric characteristics of the lake are well known, overall seepage for the 1983-1984 water year was estimated by integrating the product of seepage rate per unit area for a given rate of stage change and depth of lakebed with the representative area of lakebed at a given depth as each varied over the annual cycle, then integrating the daily rates of seepage over time. The volume of seepage outflow over the rising-water period (4 x 10(6) m(3)) is plausible if the rate of groundwater flow is constrained by the hydraulic conductivities expected for the soils. The 10-m annual change in water level and the potential movement of floodwaters into deeply weathered tropical soils, beyond the silt and clay deposits immediately adjacent to the main-stem river channel, represent conditions that are particularly conducive to seepage exchange and are representative of a significant number of lakes on the Amazon floodplain.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	1995	40	3					598	609		10.4319/lo.1995.40.3.0598	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1995.40.3.0598													WOS:A1995RE86200017

Distal fluvial to lacustrine/palustrine carbonate facies of the El-Ris Formation (Late Miocene?) at the Bahariya Depression, Western Desert, Egypt: Depositional model and controls	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												This article aims to discuss the distal fluvial to lacustrine/palustrine carbonate facies of the El-Ris Formation (Late Miocene?) in the Bahariya Depression (Western Desert, Egypt), in terms of their depositional evolution and factors (base-level, climate, tectonics) controlling deposition. The El-Ris Formation disconformably overlies the Lower Cenomanian Bahariya Formation. It is up to 11 m thick, and includes siliciclastic facies, followed upward by carbonate facies. The siliciclastic facies consist of greenish-white, fine-grained calcareous sandstones interbedded with subordinate yellowish-brown mudrocks having insects ichnofossils reflecting deposition in a distal fluvial distributary system. The carbonate facies include the fossiliferous (mostly ostracods and a few dispersed gastropods, Lanistes carinatus,) fine crystalline lacustrine/palustrine carbonates, and calcretes-dolocretes. The lacustrine/palustrine beds are grey to pale-yellow colored massive dolomitic beds, with exposure features, reflecting deposition in a shallow, low-gradient (marginal) lake with frequent base-level changes. Calcretesdolocretes are nodular to massive orange beds, developed at the expense of siliciclastic facies, that formed a fringe between the distal alluvial and central lacustrine-palustrine environments. Palustrine carbonate and duricrust (calcrete/dolocrete) facies increase progressively toward the top of the studied rock unit. The development of silica nodules in the palustrine facies is a result of intense evaporation just above the water table. Silica could have been released by silicate dissolution from the host alluvial deposits into the groundwater. 813C and 818O data indicate a hydrologically closed palustrine/lacustrine environment fed by meteoric waters, that originally precipitated calcite. Progressive evaporation of freshwater in this closed system led to dolomitization. The upward increase of carbonates in the El-Ris Formation reflects a progressive decrease of a terrigenous clastic supply in the source area and a dominance of carbonate development in the study area. During the deposition of the El-Ris Formation, the climate had marked more arid seasons with fewer intermittent humid periods. Also, the tectonic influence cannot be ruled out, since tectonic instability led to the creation of the basin depression and subsequent accommodation space that made the deposition of the El-Ris Formation.

In this area, the hydrological pattern begins with the flood from July to October, that is the main change in environmental condition. The flood is followed by a dry period from November to March; then the rainy season resumes from April with numerous and intense storms. Chlorophyll-a concentrations ranged from 5.0 to 27.4 mug l(-1) in mesotrophic Brobo reservoir and from 15.1 to 123.0 mug l(-1) in eutrophic Nambengue reservoir. Despite their different trophic states, phytoplankton production varied between 0.2 and 1.8 g C m(-2) d(-1) in both reservoirs. Both Chlorophyceae and Cyanobacteria largely dominated the phytoplankton communities. Opportunist species (mainly Chlorophyceae), with medium sized cells (10-15 mum equivalent spherical diameter, ESD), were observed during the flood. Slow growing/slow sinking species, with relatively large cells (> 15 pm ESD, mainly Cyanobacteria and Chlorophyceae), were present during the dry season. Small species (< 10 mum ESD), dominated by Chlorophyceae and Cyanobacteria were abundant during the rainy season. At this late stage of the hydrological year, N-2 fixing Cyanobacteria like Anabaena and Anabaenopsis were also present. Eight functional associations (H 1, J, K, L-M, N, P, S 1, X 1) from the thirty-one proposed by REYNOLDs et al. (2002) were outlined in the two systems surveyed; these functional groups were representative of warm, shallow, turbid, nutrient-enriched and frequently mixed habitats. A large part of the biomass was composed of cells hardly matching the needs of superior consumers, in size as well as in shape. These conditions could explain the inefficient transfer of biomass within the pelagic food web, resulting in trophic dead end and contributing to the eutrophication of the sites.																			0003-9136					MAR	2003	156	4					511	534		10.1127/0003-9136/2003/0156-0511	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2003/0156-0511													WOS:000182598500006
J	Kazantseva, TI				Kazantseva, TI			Model of energy budget of a shallow highly eutrophic lake	ZHURNAL OBSHCHEI BIOLOGII												A model of energy budget of Lake Bolshoi Okunenok ecosystem was based on the data received during field studies from May through November 1986. The model takes into account 36 components including dissolved organic matter, bacteria, phytoplankton, zooplankton, meiobenthos, macrobenthos, fish, suspended and sediment detritus. The growing season has been divided into 16 intervals according to the number of observations. The balance equation for each live component describes the change in its biomass for a time interval between two successive sampling dates. The change is considered as a balance of energy input with assimilation or feeding, and energy loss due to respiration, excretion, predation, natural mortality, fishery catchment or and emergence of imago insects. For non-live components we estimate an increase and a decrease in their mass due to the activity of living organisms, as well as organic matter exchange between water and sediments. Seasonal value of balance elements for each component are equal to sums of appropriate interval value. Comparison of energy flows through different links of a trophic web has shown that the role of a bacterial-detrital link was extremely important in Lake Bolshoi Okunenok for the growth season of 1986. Detritus constituted 58% of seasonal diet of non-predatory zooplankton, 39% of diet of predatory zooplankton, 50% of diet of planktivorous fish (fry of whitefish) and 92% of diet of benthivorous fish (fry of carp). The contribution of bacteria to the total seasonal decomposition amounted to 46%. Approximately 57% of the forage phytoplankton production, 86% of non-predatory benthos production, and 23-38% of the other trophic groups production were consumed by all grazers. "Coefficient of energy transformation" is proposed. It is calculated as: CET(s, k) = P-s(k)/P-k, where P-s(k) is production of consumers "s", built due to consumption of source "k"; P-k is production of source "k" itself. In Lake Bolshoi Okunenok only 14% of energy built by phytoplankton were accumulated in organic matter of zooplankton due to direct consumption.

The chemical parameters comprised Mn(II), particulate Mn, and oxygen concentrations and the processes included in the calculations were the Mn(II) flux from the sediment, Mn(II) oxidation, and particulate Mn removal from the water column. Field data from Greifensee obtained in 1988 and 1989 were used to determine the validity of the model and to estimate the rate constant values for the processes. Optimal values of the rate constants were determined by comparison of simulated results with field data and were in general agreement with literature values. The Mn(II) flux from the sediment exhibited similar seasonal variations in 1988 and 1989. The results show that it is possible to model the Mn cycle in a dynamic system and highlight the necessity of accurately determining the rate laws of the important processes and their relationships to the oxygen content of the waters.

In this study, Xiaofu Lake, a typical RTUL lake with high anthropogenic interference, was used as the study area. Monitoring data from 2018 to 2020 were used to analyze the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentrations with meteorological, hydrodynamic, and nutrient factors. Correlation and regression analyses were used to identify the relationship between the factors influencing eutrophication and the Chl-a. The MIKE21 model is used to simulate changes in water quality indicators. The study determined the relationship between river water quality and environmental factors and explored the causes of eutrophication in the water bodies of Xiaofu Lake. The results showed that from 2018 to 2020, the water quality showed seasonal variation and differences in spatial distribution. Except for total nitrogen, which remained at a high level (average 8.23 mg/L), other water qualities remained between classes II and IV. The proportions of mild, moderate, and severe eutrophication in the study area were 25%, 69%, and 6%, respectively. Indicators that were highly correlated with water eutrophication were turbidity, water temperature, total phosphorus, and permanganate index. The contribution of water temperature, ammonia nitrogen, and permanganate index to eutrophication was 30.5%, 22.6%, and 20.9%, respectively. The high proportion of sewage in the source of recharge water is one of the reasons for the deterioration of water quality. In addition, the change in water eutrophication was closely related to the gate operation in the region. Practitioner Points There are differences between river-type urban landscape (RTUL) lakes and natural lakes, and the conditions that cause eutrophication are different.RTUL are subject to strong human interference and rely on water transfer and gate scheduling to maintain water quantity.The high proportion of sewage treatment plant tailwater in upstream water is the main reason for the long-term pollution of RTUL.The indicators highly correlated with water eutrophication are turbidity, water temperature, total phosphorus, and permanganate index.					; zhen, wang/KBA-3844-2024	Jia, Ruipeng/0009-0003-9215-5228; 													1061-4303	1554-7531				JUL	2023	95	7							e10906	10.1002/wer.10906	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wer.10906								37353223					WOS:001024933500001

Seasonal effect on fatty acid composition in phospholipid classes and triacylglycerols of male Capoeta umbla	GRASAS Y ACEITES												The seasonal changes in muscle tissue, total lipids and fatty acid composition of phospholipids (PL), triacylglycerol (TAG), and phospholipid classes of male Capoeta umbla were investigated in this study. Phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidylserine (PS) were identified as the major phospholipids (PLs) in the muscle tissue (PS). Triacylglycerols showed high contents of MUFA, 14:0, 16:1n-7, 18:1n-9, 18:2n-6, and 18:3n-3; while phospholipids presented high contents of AA, DHA, and 18:0. Myristic acid, 16:1n-7, 18: 1n-9, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), linoleic acid (18:2n-6), and linolenic acid (18:3n-3) were shown to be present in larger concentrations in TAG than in PL classes. In PL classes, 16:0, 18:0, arachidonic acid (20: 4n-6) (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (20:5n-3), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (22:6n-3) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (Sigma PUFA) were higher than the TAG fraction. The fatty acid composition of total lipid and lipid classes (TAG and PL) were affected by the seasonal variations and lipid fraction.					kaya, Hacer/AAG-4788-2021; kaçar, semra/H-3928-2015	kacar, semra/0000-0002-9869-9045													0017-3495	1988-4214				JUL-SEP	2023	74	3							e521	10.3989/gya.0452221	http://dx.doi.org/10.3989/gya.0452221													WOS:001152588300011

In this study, we analysed hydrological responses to transitions in land use/cover and climate impacts within Lake Chilwa Basin in Malawi, using the soil and water assessment tools (SWAT). Results show that deforestation and cropland expansion largely characterized the basin, particularly in the 2000s decade. SWAT model proved highly effective in analyzing impacts of environmental changes, with indicators such as Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (Ens), Per cent bias (PBIAS) and ratio of root mean square error to measured standard deviation (RSR) presenting satisfactory values of; 0.88, 0.86; - 11.6%, - 19.8% and 0.34, 0.37 after calibration and validation, respectively. Comparison of exceedance probability between periods provided evidence of increasing runoff of up to 11% and subsequent declining baseflows linked to deforestation; irrespective of climate influence which portrayed a decrease-increase-decrease decadal impact on streamflow. The study further shows that forest vegetation tended to escalate evapotranspiration (ET), although the forest role of reducing runoff and enhancing groundwater recharge outweighed the ET effect. Since most watersheds in the basin remain significantly deforested, the threat of increased runoff leading to flooding and declining dry-seasonal river flows is certain.					; Ngongondo, Cosmo/LBH-8357-2024; Monjerezi, Maurice/HHR-9470-2022	Monjerezi, Maurice/0000-0003-1136-0653; Ngongondo, Cosmo/0000-0003-3282-1260; 													2190-5487	2190-5495				JUL	2023	13	7							161	10.1007/s13201-023-01965-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13201-023-01965-8													WOS:001018270800001

Samples were bought within local markets from 2012 to 2017 at the end of the dry season. Results showed that mercury concentrations fluctuated between years and within species, except in the Caranx sexfasciatus, which showed no significant differences (Kruskall-Wallis, p-value > 0.05, df = 5) and an average concentration of 0.371 +/- 0.162 mu g g(-1) DW. Arsenic was found in high concentrations across species and years and varied widely in C. sexfasciatus, the lowest value being 0.32 +/- 0.01 mu g g(-1) DW in 2012 and the highest was 5.63 +/- 1.89 mu g g(-1) DW in 2017. The highest nickel concentrations were found in 2016 across four of the six species. The fish samples displayed very low cadmium and lead concentrations throughout the study. In addition, the potential human health risk due to fish consumption was assessed. This showed that mercury is the only one of the five metals present in concentrations high enough to individually pose a potential hazard, the only metal likely to be accumulated beyond a safe concentration in Kendari. Chanos chanos never posed a toxicological risk based on the results of this research.

H.; Brown, Erik T.; Brown, Robert			Sedimentological and geochemical characterization of a varved sediment record from the northern Neotropics	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Annually resolved sedimentological records (including annual varves) can be used to develop precise chronologies for key climatic and tectonic events. Varved records, however, are most common in high latitude lakes, resulting in a spatial bias with respect to annually resolved records in tropical regions. Here we report on the sedimentology of two sediment cores from Lake Izabal, eastern Guatemala, that contain a well-preserved thinly laminated section spanning ca. 2200 years of the mid-Holocene. We integrate radiocarbon age-depth modeling, sedimentological observations, laminae counting, & mu;X-ray fluorescence scanning, and multivariate statistical analyses to constrain the nature and chronology of the laminations. Our sedimentological and geochemical results suggest that the alternating clastic (dark) and biogenic (light) laminae couplets were deposited annually. Dark laminae are characterized by an abundance of detrital grains, organic detritus, total organic carbon, and terrigenic elements, and most likely formed during times of increased discharge during the rainy season. In contrast, light laminae are characterized by a decrease in detrital grains and total organic carbon, and an increase in biogenic silica constituents, and were likely deposited at times of increased lake productivity during the dry season. We compare a floating varve chronology that spans ca. 2200 years with three radiocarbon-based age-depth models. Consistency between the varve chronology and one of the models partially supports the annual character of the laminated section in Lake Izabal. This laminated section, one of the first annually resolved sedimentological records from Central America, can help explore mid-Holocene hydroclimate variability and regional tectonic processes in this understudied region.					; Zimmerman, Susan/A-3351-2013	, Robert Brown/0009-0006-0109-2367; Brown, Erik T/0000-0001-7154-2729; Zimmerman, Susan/0000-0002-1320-1878; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				OCT	2023	70	3					205	223		10.1007/s10933-023-00292-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-023-00292-x		JUN 2023											WOS:001017505000001

Gonadal sexual dimorphism was identifiable in all specimens. Throughout the sampling period, a notably female-biased sex ratio (proportions of males: females = 0.43 : 1) was observed. Ages of fish, based on otolith daily increment counts, were 43-116 days during the warmer period (WP, March to October) and 44-121 days during the colder period (CP, November to February) for females (13.1-31.1 mm SL), 35-92 (WP) and 48-84 (CP) days for males (12.0-25.5 mm SL). Growth patterns (regressed by logistic growth equations) in the WP and CP revealed faster growth of both females and males in the WP than in the CP, females growing larger and living longer than males. The size of females at sexual maturation was estimated as greater than ca. 20 mm SL in the WP and ca. 23.0 mm SL in the CP. The age at reproductive size and maximum ages recorded showed R. rubrodorsalis to be progenetic with a short lifespan, allowing approximately three successive generations per year. The ratio of mature to immature females was greater during the WP, being clearly correlated with the extension of day length. The ratio of male occurrence also tended to increase with increasing day length during the WP. Feeding incidence rates (%) were high (>90 % throughout the sampling period), gut contents comprising mainly unidentifiable detritus followed by zooplankton, aquatic/terrestrial insects, algae and insect eggs, indicating that R. rubrodorsalis has an omnivorous feeding habit.																			0936-9902					DEC	2014	25	3					277	287																WOS:000348624500008

Feeding ecology of the slaty-backed gull (Larus schistisagus) on Kuril'skoe Lake (southern Kamchatka Peninsula)	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												Data on the feeding of the slaty-backed gull (Larus schistisagus) nesting at the largest Asian red salmon spawning site-Kuril'skoe Lake (southern Kamchatka)-are analyzed. The seasonal dynamics of the qualitative composition of the diet of nesting slaty-backed gulls was determined. The data on the diet obtained for the lake and coastal nesting populations are compared. Typical colonies of slaty-backed gulls are situated no farther than 3 km from the sea. The birds use the following foraging strategies: (1) foraging near the colony; (2) Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus) preference; and (3) feeding in the littoral zone. Red salmon is the basic component of the gull trophic chain in the lake ecosystem. The seasonal changes in the typical foraging strategies of slaty-backed gulls observed on Kuril'skoe Lake depended on the state of food reserves. Foraging flights of gulls for the red salmon did not exceed 5 km, whereas the use of littoral food was minimal. In addition, red salmon gurry was also the mass food for gulls, which was collected at a distance of approximately 40 km from the colony.

Fish exhibited a high interindividual variablity in pollutant concentrations. Since the accumulation of such persistent contaminants is obtained from food, the cc-occurrence of dietary differentiation leading to the contaminant interindividual variability was suspected. delta N-15 and delta C-13 were used for assessing trophic position and food source differences among Arctic char. The low ranges of delta N-15 and delta C-13 could not explain the interindividual variability in pollutant concentrations. The lack of relation between delta N-15 and contaminant concentration did not suggest a trophic level biomagnification of PCB, DDE, and Hg. Lake Geneva spatial variability in pollutants may be an important factor of variability within the Arctic char population. The bioaccumulation pattern occurring for Hg was not apparent for PCB and DDE. Organochlorines are hydrophobic contaminants, and their bioaccumulation pattern may be masked by seasonal variations in fish lipid content.

We calculated size spectra for the planktonic community of Lake Ciso. Data from 3 yr were used to analyze seasonal patterns of size distribution. The average spectrum showed peaks of biomass at 0.5-0.7, 4, 15, 32, 64, 85, and 200-mu-m of equivalent spherical diameter. These peaks corresponded to the dominant organisms in the lake: heterotrophic bacteria, purple phototrophic bacteria, Cryptomonas phaseolus, small ciliates including Coleps hirtus, large ciliates, rotifers including Anuraeopsis fissa, and copepods. The peak at 4-mu-m was the largest (3 or more times the biomass of the others). We used these data to test the utility of the size spectral approach to describe seasonal changes in the lake. Both linear and polynomial equations were fitted to the normalized spectra. Although the slope of the linear fit did not show any seasonal trend, the second-order coefficient of the polynomial fit presented a clear pattern that made it a useful index of the degree of procaryotic dominance. The lake alternated between anaerobic conditions during mixing, when procaryotes dominated and polynomial fits were best, and stratification, when polynomial and linear curves fit equally well.					; Pedros-Alio, Carlos/H-1222-2011; Gasol, Josep/B-1709-2008; Pedrós-Alió, Carlos/H-1222-2011; Gasol, Josep M/B-1709-2008	Guerrero, Ricardo/0000-0001-5019-9933; Pedros-Alio, Carlos/0000-0003-1009-4277; Gasol, Josep M/0000-0001-5238-2387													0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	1991	36	5					860	872		10.4319/lo.1991.36.5.0860	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1991.36.5.0860													WOS:A1991GP59400003

However, little attention has been given to the turnover of methanotrophic communities across wet and dry periods in riparian wetlands. Here, by sequencing the pmoA gene, we investigated the turnover of soil methanotrophic communities across wet and dry periods in typical riparian wetlands that experience intensive agricultural practices. The results demonstrated that the methanotrophic abundance and diversity were significantly higher in the wet period than in the dry period, probably owing to the climatic seasonal succession and associated variation in soil edaphic factors. The cooccurrence patterns of the interspecies association analysis demonstrated that the key ecological clusters (i.e., Mod#1, Mod#2, Mod#4, Mod#5) showed contrasting correlations with soil edaphic properties between wet and dry periods. The linear regression slope of the relationships between the relative abundance of Mod#1 and the carbon to nitrogen ratio was higher in the wet period than in the dry period, whereas the linear regression slope of the relationships between the relative abundance of Mod#2 and soil nitrogen content (i.e., dissolved organic nitrogen, nitrate, and total nitrogen) was higher in the dry period than in the wet period. Moreover, Stegen's null model combined with phylogenetic group-based assembly analysis demonstrated that the methanotrophic community exhibited a higher proportion of drift (55.0%) and a lower contribution of dispersal limitation (24.5%) in the wet period than in the dry period (43.8% and 35.7%, respectively). Overall, these findings demonstrate that the turnover of methanotrophic communities across wet and dry periods were soil edaphic factors and climate dependent.

J	Clayton, JL; Menendez, R				Clayton, JL; Menendez, R			Macroinvertebrate responses to mitigative liming of Dogway Fork, West Virginia	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Dogway Fork, West Virginia, is a second-order stream affected by acid precipitation. One goal of the Acid Precipitation Mitigation Program was to determine if the composition or population levels of benthic macroinvertebrates were affected by limestone neutralization of the acidic waters (pH 4.5). Two techniques were used to determine any effects: seasonal Surber samples and in situ bioassays with selected genera. Prior to treatment, macroinvertebrate densities were low but represented a diverse group of acid-tolerant taxa. During treatment, fewer macroinvertebrates were collected in the treated segment than in the untreated control. This appears to be a result of a number of factors, including substrate, flows, drift, fish predation, accumulation of limestone fines, and changes in water chemistry. Bioassays suggest that the limestone fines were not directly detrimental to the organisms but may have limited available habitat in the mixing zone. Limestone treatment affected the species composition of Dogway Fork. During four years of treatment, several new acid-sensitive taxa were collected in the treated segment. Data suggest that, with continued treatment, populations of these taxa can be expected to increase.																			1061-2971					SEP	1996	4	3					234	246		10.1111/j.1526-100X.1996.tb00176.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-100X.1996.tb00176.x													WOS:A1996VJ21600004

In general, PL can result in convection in local region when it is a heat source in nighttime of warm season. However, at around noon on 4 May 2020 (PL is a cold source), a convection was triggered about 20 km west of PL, and rapidly enhanced and resulted in lightning when approaching PL, and then quickly weak-ened and disappeared after entering the main body of PL. In order to explore the convection formation, several obser-vational data and the Weather Research and Forecasting model were applied in this study. Results show that when the convection approaches PL, its rapid enhancement is induced by PL, and after entering the main body of PL, its quick weakening is also resulted from PL. However, the initiation of the convection is mainly induced by the local topogra-phy west of PL under a favorable large-scale background. Mechanism analysis indicates that the strong low-level con-vergence near the west shore of PL associated with lake-land breeze is responsible for the rapid enhancement of the convection, and the low-level divergence over the main body of PL associated with the lake-land breeze and the in-crease of the low-level stability induced by cooling of PL jointly result in the quick weakening of the convection. The prevailing southerly wind in low level passes through the local topography (Meiling Mountain) west of PL, and is divided into southwesterly wind (flow around Meiling) and southerly wind (flow over Meiling), and they converge in the north of Meiling, triggering the convection. This study is not only important to deepen the understanding of PL affecting regional weather, but also helpful for improving the refined forecasting of convection near PL.					黄, 安宁/K-7473-2019; wu, shanshan/KYQ-2366-2024														0048-9697	1879-1026				SEP 15	2023	891								164659	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164659	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164659		JUN 2023						37279811					WOS:001027270700001

Status of diversity, abundance and seasonal variations of gill net catches of cichlids in Lake Bosumtwi, Ghana	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												The cichlids in Lake Bosumtwi are under increasing pressure with a recent build-up in local fishing pressure. This study was conducted to assess the status and seasonal catch rates of fish species using gillnets over a two-year period. Four species and one introduced fish belonging to the Cichlidae family were encountered in the study. Coptodon discolor (Gunther, 1903) was the most abundant species, making up 75.5% of the total fish caught (100.1 kg). Tilapia busumana (Gunther, 1903) was the least abundant species, representing only 0.6% of biomass. Catch per unit effort was significantly affected by seasonality; however, species diversity, richness and evenness were not influenced by seasonal variations. The highest catch rates (975.62 g net(-1) night(-1)) were recorded in the minor wet season (August to November). No statistical differences were detected in the diversity indices estimated for all three seasons of study. The key physico-chemical parameters (conductivity, salinity, temperature and pH) measured were within the tolerance range for tilapia survival and growth, with the exception of dissolved oxygen that decreased below 3 mg l(-1) during the lake's deep mixing events in August. Overall, physico-chemical factors explained 75% of fish catches, with salinity levels correlating significantly with catch per unit effort.

The land use model predicts that when Silver Lake was a high-rank resource patch, Paleoindians optimally decreased inter-basin mobility as part of a wetland stable strategy (WSS); conversely, when Silver Lake was a low-rank resource patch, Paleoindians optimally increased inter-basin mobility using a wetland transient strategy (WTS). Specific land use expectations are developed in 500-year timesteps for the period 14.0-9.0 ka based on yearly and seasonal variations in the productivity of Silver Lake's wetland habitat. Data limitations with the fine-grained version of the model led us to test a simplified version that supports the hypothesis that Paleoindians selected the optimal land use solution, a WTS, when Silver Lake was a low-rank wetlands resource patch during the terminal Pleistocene/Early Holocene (TP/EH) and more recent groups a WSS when patch rank improved after the Early Holocene. Though the simplified model's conclusion that Paleoindians employed a WTS during the TP/EH fits the available archaeological evidence at Silver Lake and broader Great Basin/Mojave Desert, it is a static interpretation that implies Paleoindians used a single land use strategy during the several thousand-year TP/EH. This is unrealistic because pluvial lakes were dynamic water bodies that fluctuated through time and directly influenced the extent of and caloric returns from the available wetland habitat. Despite the current inability to test the fine-grained model, which we think would reveal temporal and seasonal variations in Paleoindian land use, not considering or integrating such factors into land use models misses opportunities to better understand the myriad decisions Paleoindians made under ever changing resource structure conditions.

J	Leyden, BW				Leyden, BW			Evidence of the Younger Dryas in Central America	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Three sites provide records that address whether the Younger Dryas was manifest in Central America. Marine records from Barbados and the Cariaco Basin an discussed, as well as possible climatic forcing mechanisms. Sequences from montane La Chonta Bog, Costa Rica, and lowland Lake Quexil, Guatemala, record a temperature decline of 1.5-2.5 degrees C dated between 11,070-10,400 C-14 years BP and ca. 12,000-10,300 C-14 years BP, respectively. The record from Lake La Yeguada, Panama, does not include cooling, although significant reorganization of local a communities occurred during the Younger Dryas chronozone. Colder tropical SSTs throughout deglaciation contributed to sub-regional climatic variation, more intense monsoonal activity, and cooler air temperatures. However, the temperature reversals are not associated with the coldest tropical SSTs which occurred during meltwater pulses. The temperature reversals appear to be a response to extra-tropical conditions, presumably in the North Atlantic, which suggests that Younger Dryas cooling extended as far south as Costa Rica. In Panama, monsoonal conditions may have blocked cooler temperatures. Precipitation continued to increase throughout deglaciation due to strong forcing by seasonal solar insolation in Central America while desiccation events occurred to the north and south.																			0277-3791						1995	14	9					833	839		10.1016/0277-3791(95)00065-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0277-3791(95)00065-8													WOS:A1995UH76700004

The plant was operated for 2 years at a filtration rate of 170 m/d and the surface water of Lake Biwa was employed as an influent, 2-Methylisoborneol (MIB) produced by Oscillatoria tenuis was the main cause of the musty odor, In the season of natural musty odor generation, total MIB concentration and the insoluble to total MIB concentration ratio in the influent varied to a large extent, but removal efficiencies of MIB by the filter were about 60 to 80%. Out of the season of natural musty odor, reagent MIB was added to the influent and the removal efficiencies obtained were about 70 to 80%. In addition to MIB, color, turbidity, Mn, NH4-N and KMnO4 consumption value were also effectively removed by the biological filter. Using the effluent from the filter, jar tests for powdered activated carbon treatment and coagulation-sedimentation treatment were conducted. From the results, the biological filter treatment seemed to effectively decrease the powdered activated carbon consumption even in cases where powdered activated carbon additions might be needed. No ill effect on congulation-sedimentation treatment was seen and the required coagulant dosage was less in water after biological filter treatment.																			0273-1223						1995	31	11					229	235		10.1016/0273-1223(95)00481-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0273-1223(95)00481-2													WOS:A1995RW01400035

Kuqaia has a distribution across the middle northern latitudes of Pangaea and is restricted to Lower to lower Middle Jurassic strata. Morphological characters support Kuqaia being the ephippia (resting egg/embryo cases) of Cladocera (Crustacea: Branchiopoda), and a probable early stem-group taxon of the Daphnia lineage. The paleoecology of the small planktonic crustaceans indicate purely fresh-water environments, such as lakes or ponds, all occurrences being in continental deposits, and the Kuqaia specimens possibly represent dry-season resting eggs. Chemical analyses of these and similar fossils, and of extant invertebrate eggs and egg cases are recommended to improve resolution of the biological affiliations of such mesofossil groups.					; Vajda, Vivi/N-7693-2018	, Jungang/0000-0002-4448-2756; 														1932-6203				JUN 7	2023	18	6							e0282247	10.1371/journal.pone.0282247	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0282247								37285340					WOS:001004871900004

In a field experiment soil nutrient availability, air temperature, light intensity and clipping regime were manipulated. (2) After three growing seasons, NPK fertilization more than doubled the total biomass per unit area of tussock. The increase was due mainly to higher tiller density, although tiller size also increased. A factorial fertilization experiment indicated that N was the most strongly limiting element. (3) Fertilization by NPK also increased the total content of N and P. At the start of each growing season the effect was most noticeable as increased nutrient concentrations in fertilized plants, particularly in storage tissues such as stems. However, by the time of peak biomass in August, the N and P concentrations in fertilized plants were generally no different from controls, having been diluted by greater seasonal growth in the fertilized plants than in the controls. (4) The growth of fertilized plants continued longer into the growing season than in the controls, reflecting the greater time required to reach the same minimum nutrient concentrations as the controls. (5) Increases in air temperature and decreases in irradiance had no long-term effect on total biomass or total nutrient content, although they did affect biomass and nutrient allocation. There was no interaction between these environmental factors and fertilization. (6) Clipping at 10-day intervals for one growing season reduced peak-season biomass by two-thirds, but it reduced the total content of N and P by only about one-fourth. Nutrient concentrations were extremely high in clipped plants, suggesting that even under extreme ''stress'', nutrient acquisition and retention has a very high priority. (7) We conclude that the seasonal peak in whole plant E. vaginatum biomass is closely regulated by whole-plant nutrient content. The amount of growth achieved per unit area of ground within a growing season (i.e. net production) is regulated mainly by nutrient reserves at the start of the year and by uptake after mid-July. Carbon supply does not limit the total amount of seasonal growth, but it may affect the rate at which the seasonal peak biomass is reached.					; Chapin, F/AAZ-3931-2020	Chapin III, F Stuart/0000-0002-2558-9910; 													0022-0477	1365-2745				MAR	1986	74	1					257	278		10.2307/2260362	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2260362													WOS:A1986A813800018

Mercury Contamination of an Introduced Generalist Fish of Intermediate Trophic Level	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Mercury contamination is a global issue because mercury concentrations in aquatic systems are influenced by both natural and anthropogenic pathways. Here, liver and muscle total mercury (THg) concentrations in black crappie Pomoxis nigromaculatus from three boreal lakes in southeastern Manitoba, Canada, were related to age, morphology and physiological traits to better understand the dynamics of mercury accumulation in an introduced generalist fish species. These THg concentrations were then compared to black crappie mercury concentrations in other Canadian water bodies and to mercury concentrations in other freshwater fishes in southeastern Manitoba. Age and size had strong positive correlations (P < 0.001, r >= 0.60) with muscle mercury concentrations. No evidence of acute point source contamination or physiological impairment in black crappie was found in the study area. Analysis of liver THg revealed the possible impacts of seasonal and ontogenetic differences in diet on exposure. Furthermore, THg analysis of liver and muscle tissue showed how generalist foraging may curb the progressively greater mercury exposure and resultant physiological consequences expected from ontogenetic diet shifts in black crappie. Although there appeared to be temporally varied levels of mercury exposure (i.e., liver THg) by sex, there was no sex effect observed in long-term mercury accumulation in the muscle. Black crappie bioaccumulated less mercury at age than primary piscivore species in the region. These results will help foster a better understanding of mercury biomagnification within a region impacted by legacy mercury.

J	Fraser, GS				Fraser, G. S.			Post-fledging Parental Care in Tree-nesting Double-crested Cormorants (Nannopterum auritum)	WATERBIRDS												Post-fledging parental care occurs in a wide range of colonial waterbird species but data on the behavior are limited. The behavior is hypothesized to contribute towards offspring survivorship, but opportunities for post-fledging parental care are constrained for migratory species. Two datasets were used to examine the behavior in a Great Lakes tree-nesting Double-crested Cormorant (Nannopterum auritum) colony: annual monitoring of nest success, and focal observations of successful nests. For eight nesting seasons (2012-2019) a total of 631 sample nests were tracked for nest success, fledge date, number of chicks fledged, and post-fledging adult attendance at the nest site. During the post-fledging period, 52.2% of successful nests (n = 425) had adult attendance. Fledge date was a predictor of post-fledging adult attendance (earlier nests more likely to have the behavior) but not number of chicks fledged or year of observation. Post-fledging adult attendance was estimated to average 15.9 days in length. Focal observations confirmed that fledglings visited a nest and were fed if a parent was present (10/11 times). These findings confirmed post-fledging parental care in tree-nesting Double-crested Cormorants, but late nesting birds have reduced opportunity to provision after fledging.

J	Li, WQ; Gao, B; Gong, HL; Chen, BB				Li, Wenqi; Gao, Bo; Gong, Huili; Chen, Beibei			Construction of High Spatiotemporal Continuity Surface Water Bodies Dataset in the Haihe River Basin	WATER												Surface water bodies exhibit high dynamic variability on seasonal and interannual scales, and high spatiotemporal resolution water bodies extent data are crucial for studying surface water bodies' evolution. Existing surface water bodies datasets are mainly based on optical data acquisition, which has the advantages of long temporal coverage and convenience but is susceptible to cloud contamination, leading to low spatiotemporal continuity. Although microwave remote sensing data are not affected by clouds, early SAR acquisition and short temporal coverage limit its use. Therefore, existing surface water bodies datasets face the problem of insufficient spatiotemporal resolution or low continuity. This research integrates Sentinel-2 optical data and Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations to reconstruct the surface water bodies dataset with a 6-day and 10-meter spatiotemporal resolution. Then, the proposed method introduces a spatiotemporal correlation model and predicts the land cover (water or land) of Sentinel-2 cloudy pixels, which improves the spatiotemporal continuity of the reconstructed surface water bodies dataset further. Based on the proposed method, we construct the Haihe River Water Dataset (HRWD) from 2016 to 2020 with a 6-day and 10-meter spatiotemporal resolution. Compared with the European Commission's Joint Research Centre's (JRC's) Global Surface Water Explorer and Global Surface Water Extent Dataset (GSWED), the HRWD shows a rational accuracy (e.g., the overall accuracy of the HRWD is more than 93%) and a better spatiotemporal continuity, which provide an improved performance in identifying and monitoring surface water bodies in the Haihe River Basin. This indicates that the proposed method can improve the spatiotemporal continuity of surface water body mapping and meet the needs of accurate and long-term quantitative observation of the distribution of large-scale and high spatiotemporal continuity surface water bodies.

The analyzed problems include the seasonal and daily dynamics of river flow in the warm season, the concentrations of some dissolved substances in different types of water, as well as the role of channel widenings, supra-permafrost water, and aufeises in flow formation. Various types of relationships between water discharges and the concentrations of some dissolved substances are described under varying hydrothermal conditions. The role of nonfreezing lake-like channel widenings (bochags) in the regulation of freshet flow of water and dissolved matter is evaluated. The efficiency of the automated digital registration of the level, temperature, and specific electric conductance of water with a high time resolution at hydrological gages is discussed, especially, as applied to the rapid processes in a river.					; Marta, Ksenofontova/D-3589-2014; Lebedeva, Liudmila/J-6959-2016; Shamov, Vladimir/A-5507-2011; Efremov, Victor/V-7513-2017; Pavlova, Nadezhda/W-2163-2018	Ksenofontova, Marta/0000-0003-1084-5149; Lebedeva, Liudmila/0000-0002-7498-9902; Shamov, Vladimir/0000-0001-9310-1836; Pavlova, Nadezhda/0000-0001-5473-7778													0097-8078	1608-344X				JUN	2023	50	3					379	391		10.1134/S0097807823030120	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0097807823030120													WOS:000998492300004

The Infestation of Snails of the Genus Bithynia with Cercariae of the Trematodes of the Family Opisthorchiidae in Water Bodies of the Ob River Basin (Tomsk Oblast, Russia)	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA												Gastropods of the family Bithyniidae are common inhabitants of freshwater reservoirs of Western Siberia. They make up to 16% of the biomass of gastropods in the ecosystems of the south of Western Siberia. In Bithynid snails from the water bodies of this region, 33 species of parthenite trematodes of 15 families were found, of which the greatest medical importance is established in the parasites of the hepatobiliary system of the trematode of the Opisthorchiidae family. The liver fluke Opisthorchis felineus (Rivolta, 1884) is the causative agent of a dangerous zooanthroponosis - opisthorchiasis. In Western Siberia, in the basins of the Ob and Irtysh rivers, there is a powerful natural focus of opisthorchiasis. The study of the first intermediate hosts and their infestation with O. felineus cercariae is a necessary component in the assessment of the epidemiological situation and in the prevention of opisthorchiasis. It is important to understand the dynamics of opisthorchia infestation of the first intermediate hosts and to analyse the factors influencing their infestation. This work is aimed to study the infection of gastropods of the family Bithyniidae with opisthorchid cercariae, and especially Opisthorchis felineus in the middle Ob basin. The material for the study was collected along the banks of floodplain lakes and the channel of the Ob River basin. For two seasons of 2021-2022, snails of the genus Bithynia (2987 specimens) of two species B. troshelii (Paasch, 1842) (1558 specimens), B. tentaculata (Linnaeus, 1758) (1429 specimens) were collected. Detection and separation of cercariae was carried out by compression, using light microscopy, isolated cercariae were fixed in 70% ethanol to clarify their systematic status. Cercariae were identified by morphological features. Morphological identification of cercariae of the family Opisthorchiidae was confirmed by molecular genetic methods - PCR diagnostics based on a genetic marker. As a result of our research, two species of snails of the genus Bithynia (B. tentaculata and B. troschelii) were identified, their average abundance was 60.1 ind. m-2. In general, no differences in the number of two species of snails in water bodies were found during the period of research. Trematode cercariae were found in 108 snails specimens; only 17 snails contained O. felineus. The general extensiveness of the invasion of snails of the genus Bithynia by trematode cercariae accounted for 3.62%, B. tentaculata - 3.98%, and B. troschelii - 3.27%. Extensiveness of invasion in the two species of snails in general in water bodies varies significantly, as well as the observed differences in the level of infection over the years of observation (Fisher test, p < 0.05). Extensiveness of invasion of snails B. troschelii by cercariae O. felineus was 1.09% as a whole, varying in different reservoirs. The most infected with O. felineus were snails from flowing water bodies (rivers, channels), less infected in lakes that do not have an annual connection with the river, and not infected in continental lakes (Fisher test, p < 0.05). The study of the seasonal dynamics of infection of snails showed that in samples from May to mid-June, no infected snails were noted in any of the studied water bodies, snails with cercariae were noted only from the second half of June and in July. Thus, the snails Bithynia troschelii, which are the first intermediate hosts of the trematodes Opisthorchis felineus, live in the basin of the middle Ob. The number of snails varies from 3 to 110 ind. m-2 depending on the reservoir. In general, the prevalence of invasion of snails by O. felineus cercariae is low, in different water bodies it varies from 0% to 14.3%. Infestation depends on the type of reservoir, season, and year of observation.

J	Lentz, KA; Dunson, WA				Lentz, KA; Dunson, WA			Distinguishing characteristics of temporary pond habitat of endangered northeastern bulrush, Scirpus ancistrochaetus	WETLANDS												Habitat characteristics of wetlands that contain the federally endangered sedge, Scirpus ancistrochaetus, were investigated in a one-point-in-time held survey. Sixteen adjacent seasonal ponds, four of which supported populations of S. ancistrochaetus, were sampled for 26 habitat variables. Using only five of these variables, we were able to separate ponds with and without S. ancistrochaetus in a linear discriminant analysis. These five variables are wetland area, percent cover of overlying forest canopy, soil percent organic matter, soil exchangeable [Na], and water [H-]. Ponds containing S. ancistrochaetus had higher soil organic matter content, higher soil [Na], greater area, lower water [H+], and lower percent forest canopy cover compared to ponds that did not support this species. This information can be used toward understanding factors that control the distribution of this species and also toward evaluating possible habitat fur reintroduction of this endangered species.						, Kendra Cipollini/0009-0007-2307-7843													0277-5212	1943-6246				MAR	1999	19	1					162	167		10.1007/BF03161745	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03161745													WOS:000079409700018
J	Haberyan, KA; Umana, G; Collado, C; Horn, SP				Haberyan, KA; Umana, G; Collado, C; Horn, SP			Observations on the plankton of some Costa Rican lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We sampled 30 lakes in Costa Rica in the wet season (July-August) of 1991 for phytoplankton (with integrated and whole water samples), and 17 for zooplankton (with net tows). Taxa of plankton and community richness were poorly related to geography, morphology, chemistry, and other biota. Neither the zooplankton nor the phytoplankton appeared to influence the composition of the other, and neither were apparently influenced by the presence of fish. Phytoplankton richness reflected primarily sampling method, but also tended to decrease with elevation and with Secchi disk depth, and tended to increase with pH and alkalinity. Chlorophytes were the most abundant division in 14 lakes; these lakes tended to be unstratified, turbid, and located at higher elevation. Diatoms were common in 4 of the 7 lakes with elevated silica (over 30 ppm). Each lake showed at least a 3 : 1 dominance by copepods, cladocera, or insect larvae. Copepods dominated 7 of the 17 lakes, most of which were shallow, turbid, and had low alkalinity. CIadocera dominated 7 lakes that were typically deeper and located at low- to mid-elevations. Insect larvae dominated two small, turbid lakes.					; Horn, Sally/B-1918-2013	Horn, Sally/0000-0002-0575-3664; 													0018-8158					SEP 15	1995	312	2					75	85		10.1007/BF00020763	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00020763													WOS:A1995TL93500001
J	RESH, VH; ROSENBERG, DM				RESH, VH; ROSENBERG, DM			SPATIAL TEMPORAL VARIABILITY AND THE STUDY OF AQUATIC INSECTS	CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST												Spatial and temporal variability are essential considerations in the study of aquatic insects. Traditionally, these two sources of variability are treated separately; however they should be considered together because they occur concurrently in natural systems. To illustrate this interaction, we constructed two-way variability tables in which spatial (habitat, reach or zone, system, intersystem) and temporal (within a day, within a season, within a year, year to year) scales were ordered on separate axes, and examples of concurrent spatial and temporal variability were entered at the intersects of the scales. We examined three aspects of aquatic insect life histories in lotic and lentic waters using such tables: emergence, feeding and growth, and movements and migrations. It proved easier to find examples for the stream tables than for the lake tables, perhaps because of greater spatial and temporal variability in lotic than lentic waters. Also, more papers have been published on stream than on lake insects over the last decade or so. Spatial and temporal scales at which lotic and lentic research is done were determined by examining the recent contents of five key journals (.apprxeq. 500 articles). Research on aquatic insects appears generally to be done at relatively long temporal scales, but at smaller spatial and shorter temporal scales in lotic than lentic systms. Perusal of the literature to find examples of concurrent spatial and temporal variability revealed the prevalence of a "mean-values" approach to data analysis, in which investigators "homogenize" data to reduce spatial and temporal variability. However, it is this spatial and temoral variability that often provides an explanation of factors causing the patterns observed. A ''variance" approach, in which data are disaggregated and fluctuations or extremes are considered, may be far more informative and may elucidate underlying mechanisms.																			0008-347X	1918-3240				NOV	1989	121	11					941	963		10.4039/Ent121941-11	http://dx.doi.org/10.4039/Ent121941-11													WOS:A1989CC75100003
J	Ignatieva, NV				Ignatieva, NV			Distribution and release of sedimentary phosphorus in Lake Ladoga	HYDROBIOLOGIA					1st International Lake Ladoga Symposium on Ecological Problems of Lake Ladoga	NOV 22-26, 1993	ST PETERSBURG, RUSSIA	Univ Joensuu, Finland, Russian Acad Sci, Inst Limnol				Sedimentary phosphorus fractions and phosphorus release from the sediments were studied in Lake Ladoga at altogether 46 sampling sites, representing the full range of sediment types encountered in the lake. Determination of P fractions and physico-chemical analyses were made of surface sediment cores (10-20 cm long, each sampled at 3-4 levels) and in the overlying water. The range of total phosphorus per dry weight of sediment was 0.2-3.3 mg g(-1), and that of inorganic P 0.1-2.5 mg g(-1). The levels of interstitial soluble phosphorus, range 2-613 mu g l(-1) for total P and 1-315 mu g l(-1) for inorganic P, were higher than those of dissolved P concentrations in the overlying water. Diffusive fluxes of phosphate from sediment to the overlying water were estimated using three independent methods. The estimated range was 4-914 mu g P m(-2) d(-1); the mean value for the whole bottom area, 0.1 mg P m(-2) d(-1), is lower than previously published estimates. The estimated annual contribution of sedimentary inorganic P flux to Lake Ladoga water is equal to 620 tons of P per year, which amounts to more than 10% of the estimated external P load into the lake. 68% of the total diffusive flux emanates from deep water sediments, which are not exposed to seasonal variation of conditions. In deep lakes, such as Lake Ladoga, phosphorus release from the sediments is controlled primarily by diffusive mechanisms. Wave action and currents as well as bioturbation are probably of importance mainly in shallow near-shore areas. Phosphorus release by gas ebullition and macrophytes is considered negligible.																			0018-8158					APR 12	1996	322	1-3					129	136		10.1007/BF00031817	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00031817													WOS:A1996UT84700021

A.; Karthick, Balasubramanian			Holocene climate dynamics and ecological responses in Kaas Plateau, Western Ghats, India: Evidence from lacustrine deposits	QUATERNARY SCIENCE ADVANCES												The Kaas lake is one of the unique sedimentary basins in the Northern region of the Western Ghats escarpment of India and preserves paleoclimate signals of the Holocene in its cover sequence over the lateritic basement. The signatures preserved in the lacustrine deposits, such as pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, diatoms, and geochemistry of the sediments, were decoded and used to reconstruct the Holocene environmental changes of the Kaas Plateau in the Western Ghats. The main stages in the lake's evolution indicate the following: (1) low nutrient level and strongly changeable water levels in the early Holocene, (2) persistence of the oligotrophic state of the lake up to the last 2000 yr, and (3) strong cultural eutrophication of the lake in the recent period (c. 1000 years). The localized depression or a seasonal-lake favoured freshwater accumulation since 8.0 kyr BP and was probably dried sometimes after 2.0 kyr BP. A late Holocene peak of planktonic diatom and high organic recovery at the top level in the recent past (c. 1000 years) represents an event of eutrophication, possibly due to human impact. Being a seasonal lake, the plateau surface allowed clay accumulation with an extremely slow rate of 2.5 cm/10 kyr. Diatoms, pollen, and non-pollen palynomorphs together showed periodic fluctuations in lake hy-drology, which was probably in response to climate-controlled vegetation on the Kaas Plateau. The diatom and sediment anomalies point to an ecological shift towards the mid-Holocene, supporting the hypothesis of increased Southwest Monsoons during the early Holocene around 8.0 kyr BP and the relative weakening of Northeast Monsoon after 2.5 kyr BP.					; Thacker, Mital/JBS-7367-2023; Balasubramanian, Karthick/P-5763-2014	Karthick, Balasubramanian/0000-0003-4066-2458; 													2666-0334					JUL	2023	11								100087	10.1016/j.qsa.2023.100087	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.qsa.2023.100087		MAY 2023											WOS:001012884800001
J	Peng, C; Li, PP				Peng, Chao; Li, Pingping			Abiotic and Biotic Effects on Microbial Diversity of Small Water Bodies in and around Towns	SUSTAINABILITY												Microbial communities play very important roles in pollutant treatment and absorption and material and energy cycling in wetlands. Among different wetland types, wetlands in and around towns are the most closely related to human life, but how human activities affect microbes in small water bodies has received little attention. In this study, nine small water bodies of three different landscape types were chosen in the Lishui District of Nanjing City, China. The microbial community characteristics of four different seasons were revealed by metagenomics in 2021, and the possible effects of abiotic and biological factors such as the effects of alien organisms on microbial communities were analyzed. The results showed significant differences in microbial community structure in different seasons and habitats. Abiotic and biological factors jointly affected the microbial communities, and the influence of water quality was greater than that of the habitat type and biological factors. This study shows that in addition to the water quality, the wetland biome structure, especially the abundance of alien species, may have an impact on microbial communities. The results emphasize that human activities such as land use and the introduction of alien species have significant impacts on the ecosystem structure and function.

Initially haplochromine cichlids formed the main food item for the Nile perch. Despite their decline, haplochromines still formed the major part of its diet in 1986. After the virtually complete disappearance of the haplochromines in 1987 and 1988, the benthic shrimp Caridina nilotica, the pelagic cyprinid, Rastrineobola argentea and juvenile Nile perch became the main food of Nile perch. Twenty-four trawl sessions were conducted to determine the relative quantities of respective prey taken. When present, Caridina is the major prey, mainly taken by day. If absent, juvenile Nile perch constitute the main part of the diet. Seasonal differences in diet composition probably reflect seasonal fluctuations in the abundance of the main prey species.																			0018-8158					APR 10	1992	232	1					79	83		10.1007/BF00014615	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00014615													WOS:A1992JA10300012

Substantial release of radionuclides to the water column has been documented at this site. Solid phase Pb-210 profiles do not match the expected input history, suggesting that the radionuclide may be undergoing redistribution. High levels of the radionuclides were measured in pore waters, consistent with partition coefficients in the range from 10(3) to 10(4). The high pore water activities, apparent redistribution pattern, and the documented release of Pb-210 from these sediments to the water column, all point to the possible importance of pore water diffusion as a Pb-210 transport mechanism. The distribution of Pb-210 in these sediments was successfully modeled using a combination of sediment burial and pore water diffusion without the need to invoke particle reworking. Theoretical analysis supports the idea that in some cases large dating errors can result if diffusive redistribution of Pb-210 is neglected.

J	CATTANEO, A				CATTANEO, A			PERIPHYTON IN LAKES OF DIFFERENT TROPHY	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												In a study of 10 lakes in the Eastern Townships (Quebec [Canada]) periphyton biomass correlated less well with total P (TP) concentration in the water than did phytoplankton biomass. The relationship with TP was improved somewhat when periphyton biomass was estimated as cell volume rather than as chlorophyll or organic material. When the community was divided among various groups according to taxa, life form, and size, only the biomasses of greens, filamentous algae, and algae exceeding 10000 .mu.m were correlated with TP. The biomass of the smaller algae, which are more readily grazed by benthos, was about the same in all lakes whereas nuisance forms increased significantly with P enrichment. At more eutrophic sites, maximal periphyton biomasses were observed in midsummer, coinciding with peak recreational use of lakes, whereas at the other sites, maxima appeared earlier in the season.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				FEB	1987	44	2					296	303		10.1139/f87-038	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f87-038													WOS:A1987G352800006
J	MITTELBACH, GG				MITTELBACH, GG			PREDATION AND RESOURCE PARTITIONING IN 2 SUNFISHES (CENTRARCHIDAE)	ECOLOGY												The diet and habitat use of 2 congeneric sunfishes are examined in light of the effects of size-specific predation risk and foraging efficiency. Large bluegills (Lepomis macrochirus) and pumpkinseeds (L. gibbosus) (> 75 mm SL) exhibited distinct diet and habitat separation in 3 small Michigan [USA] lakes. Bluegills foraged primarily on open-water zooplankton (Daphnia), while pumpkinseeds specialized on vegetation-dwelling gastropods. These differences in resource use by large fish were directly related to differences in their functional morphology and foraging ability. In laboratory feeding experiments, pumpkinseeds had significantly lower prey handling times for gastropods than did bluegills. The bluegill was the more efficient of the 2 spp. when feeding on zooplankton (Daphnia). In contrast to the large fish, the diets and habitat use of small bluegills and pumpkinseeds (.ltoreq. 75 mm SL [standard length]) were quite similar. Small fish of both species foraged predominantly in the vegetation, and 76-91% of their average seasonal diet was vegetation-dwelling prey (nongastropods). This increase in shared resources among small fish was due to 2 factors as follows: piscivorous fish restrict small size-classes to the vegetation where they are less vulnerable; small pumpkinseeds are unable to feed effectively on snails, the adult resource in the vegetation. Laboratory comparisons of the foraging rate of small bluegills and pumpkinseeds on vegetation-dwelling prey, and field measures of the growth rate of each species while occupying the vegetation, indicate that the 2 spp. are nearly equal competitors in the juvenile habitat. The 2 spp. were not in equal abundance across the study lakes; the ratio of bluegills to pumpkinseeds ranged from 25:1 to 1:1. The pattern in species abundance was directly related to the availability of adult resources (snails and zooplankton) in each of the lakes, suggesting that the volume of the competitive refuge experienced by each species at larger sizes is the predominant factor controlling their relative numbers.

Two methods, microscopy and chemotaxonomy, were used to determine the taxonomical composition of autotrophs. Both methods identified diatoms, Chlorophyta, and Cyanobacteria as the dominant groups across the lakes. Considerable congruence of the taxonomical methods was found for diatoms and Chlorophyta, however results for Cyanobacteria showed poor correlation. The differences in periphyton features among the lakes were mostly explained by the lake age and trophy. Moreover, high amounts of overwintering biomass show that periphyton development is not established "de novo" each year but its current stage is a cumulative result of previous years. Beside the lake age and trophy, limnological characteristics such as Si or Mg2+ also affect periphyton taxonomical composition. No correlation of periphytic C:N:P molar ratios with lake water nitrogen and phosphorus, suggests role of additional process to the nutrient uptake, likely internal nutrient recycling in periphyton. These findings are essential in predicting further succession in the examined post-mining lakes and serve as a model for newly formed lakes. As more lakes will be formed within the post-mining recultivation in the short horizon, our study contributes to their successful management.

HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL												The current geostationary satellite images have a time resolution of minutes. It is not clear how useful they are for detecting diurnal and seasonal changes. We tested this by comparing lake surface temperatures (LSTs) from Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) images with in situ measurements in Lake Kasumigaura, Japan, for one year. LST products of the Sentinel-3 satellites were also compared. We found that instantaneous LSTs can be estimated with an root mean square difference (RMSE) of 0.6 degrees C. A large amount of data (N = 10(2)-10(3)) is available for each month, but N differs greatly in the range of 216-2771. A good agreement (RMSE of 0.9 degrees C) was found between monthly mean LSTs from Himawari-8 and in situ measurements, and it is better than the RMSE of 1.2-1.7 degrees C found for the Sentinel-3 LST products. The diurnal change detection was more difficult due to insufficient data numbers around noon. Practical remedies for this issue are suggested.

The annual values of loading for TP and TN were mostly not higher than 1.0 and 15.0 g m(-2) lake area, respectively and rather low compared to other river-lake systems in the lakeland region. However, these values as well as nutrient in-lake retention decreased in 1997-1998 (warm and dry years) compared with 1978 and 1996, together with the decrease in discharge and exchange rate of lake water. In selected cases the retention of TP and TKN became negative which means that the lake functioned as the source of nutrients for downstream fragments of the system. The retention of nitrate-nitrogen was usually positive - lakes remained effective sites for its removal (denitrification). The possible changes in functioning of small catchments and chains of shallow, eutrophic lakes under the conditions of global warming are discussed.																			1505-2249						2002	50	4					459	474																WOS:000180144900004

Vertical and horizontal distribution of European whitefish and population density were assessed with hydroacoustic methods. Whitefish were sampled for analysis of stomach contents and growth data. Laboratory experiments were conducted to quantify the relationship between turbidity and feeding activity at different zooplankton concentrations. Whitefish showed clear avoidance in horizontal and vertical directions of areas with high turbidity. Vertical displacement of whitefish into deeper water layers, obviously caused by turbidity, leads to worse feeding conditions for whitefish. This effect is the result of poor visual conditions on the one hand and lower prey density on the other. This pattern was found in the laboratory where declines in ration were related to increased turbidity. Cladocerans, the preferred prey of the whitefish, mainly inhabit the epilimnion of Lake Ammersee. During periods of elevated turbidity, caused by high flows of the main tributary, the stomachs of whitefish were found to be nearly empty. Depending on the intensity and frequency of turbidity events, feeding may stop for several weeks during the growing season. In addition to the effects of oligotrophication and density-dependent factors, this is an important reason for the comparatively poor growth of Lake Ammersee whitefish.																			0071-1128		3-510-47059-1				2002	57						265	275																WOS:000180355400023
J	Rybak, J				Rybak, J			Seasonal and long-term export rates of nutrients with surface runoff in the river Jorka catchment basin (Masurian Lakeland, Poland)	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												In the Masurian Lakeland a medium size catchment basin of the Jorka river-lake system (about 65 km(2)) was studied intensively in 1996-1998 (April- October) and compared with the data from the late 1970s. Nutrients (TP, TKN, N-NO3) and chlorides were monitored in 15 short lakeshore streams draining small subcatchments that differed in land use. The annual and monthly concentration values of nutrients were measured as well as the annual load in kg ha(-1) year(-1). The data indicate that in a mosaic, hilly region the export rates from the diversified small catchments of both TP and TN tend to be low, lower than in other, non-mosaic areas; the values of export rates are mainly dependent on the discharge in the subcatchments: that is why the values for 1998 and/or 1997 were usually lower than for other years. There is a tendency to lower concentration for nutrients (including chlorides) and export rates in the subcatchments objected to low impact of agriculture (forest, wetland) than in the subcatchments dominated by cropland. Extremely high values were found for a few catchments with cropland, additionally polluted by sewage disposal in the vicinity.																			1505-2249						2002	50	4					439	458																WOS:000180144900003

Highest humidity was experienced in the region prior to ca. 6500 yr BP, before the semi-deciduous forest formations became widespread in the region. From ca. 5000 yr BP, the forests around Lake Victoria were mainly of semidecideous character with increasing abundance of celtis associated with Holoptelea grandis, mixed with some Guineo-Congolian elements such as Tetrorchidium. The period ca. 4100 to ca. 3000 yr BP shows a progressive decline of the semideciduous forest formations and the establishment of open vegetation with Capparidaceae and Gramineae attesting to a dry climate. After ca. 3000 yr BP, the pollen data particulary that from high altitude, evidence an amelioration of climate. The dry montane forest with Podocarpus and Juniperus procera underwent significant extension which reached a maximum at ca. 1700 yr BP. At low altitude, the extension of the semideciduous forests in relation to this improvement of climate, is evidenced mainly until ca. 2200 yr BP. During this sub-humid climatic phase, either the amount of precipitation was inadequate or the dry season was too long for a large development of evergreen forests in the Lake Victoria region. Pollen data from this core and from the other cores in the region indicates that the increase in rainfall during this period was larger and lasted for a longer duration in the high altitude sites than at low attitude. From ca, 1700 yr BP, the significant decrease in the abundance of the pollen of the regional taxa indicates a decline of the Juniperus-Podocarpus dry montane forest or a reduction in precipitation at high altitude. During this dry period, both the montane and the semideciduous forests decline at the profit of the open grass dominated formations: open woodlands and probably savannas.																					1-4020-0772-8				2002	12						509	523																WOS:000179074600021

Young females reached sexual maturity at a weight of 26.3 g and a length of 67.2 mm. The annual cyclic changes in weight and histological composition of the ovaries showed that R. epeirotica has a single reproductive period each year. Weight changes of the oviducts followed those shown by the ovaries. A continuous change in the percentage and diameter size of the ovarian follicles through the annual cycle was found. Clutch size ranged from 600 to 2900 ova of 1.3 to 1.6 mm egg diameter. Ovarian weight, clutch size and ovum size were positively correlated to body weight. The weights of fat body and liver had a peak in August and November respectively and they both were reduced considerably during hibernation.																			0173-5373	1568-5381					2002	23	3					269	280		10.1163/15685380260449153	http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15685380260449153													WOS:000179247800003

Cd was lost rapidly from the water column to sediments. Sediment cores (1987-1993) document increasing (from <1 to >5 mg . kg dry mass(-1)) sediment Cd concentration over time, sediment storage accounting for 90-95% of added Cd. Sedimentation of Cd occurred in both depositional and erosional sediment zones. Sandy sediments at shallow sites, despite having low sediment Cd concentrations, were important sinks for Cd because of their great mass per unit area. Progressive transport of Cd into the mixed sediment layer (8-10 cm thick, mixing in a decade or more) at deep sites was another important sink. Selective extractions suggest weak surface adsorption of Cd to Mn and Fe oxyhydroxides in periphyton and sedimenting particles, with high K-d Bottom sediments have lower K-d, although Cd tends to be associated with more strongly bound organic or sulfide fractions. This may indicate loss of easily mobilized Cd from bottom sediment during diagenesis. Because Cd is readily released from fresh sediment, we hypothesize that recycling of sediment Cd to the water column will slow the recovery of Lake 382 to premanipulation conditions.																			0706-652X					AUG	1996	53	8					1888	1902		10.1139/cjfas-53-8-1888	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-53-8-1888													WOS:A1996VX38300022

Athalassic saline lakes, such as these, are believed to be extremely rare in arctic regions. All three study lakes exhibited a gradual shoreline retreat over the season (28 May to 22 August 1992) due to evaporative water loss. As the season progressed, the saline lake exhibited a marked increase in conductivity and salinity, similar to changes observed for inland salt lakes in more southern regions. The seasonal changes in water chemistry were less pronounced in the subsaline and freshwater lakes. The periphytic diatom populations of the saline lake closely tracked changes in the lake's salinity, exhibiting a successional shift from taxa with low salt tolerances (e.g., Nitzschia cf. commutata and N. cf. palea) to those with high salt tolerances (e.g., Amphora acutiuscula) over the study period. Periphytic diatoms in the subsaline and freshwater lakes also exhibited marked successional changes, shifting to almost complete dominance by a single species (Cocconeis placentula and Achnanthes minutissima respectively), but these shifts were not related to lake water salinity alone.

The upper part of this stratigraphic unit records deposition within prevailing shallow lake conditions. Well-developed sequences crop out near Jiyuan, western Henan Province, central China. Six sedimentary facies clustered into two facies assemblages were recognized in the lacustrine section. Facies assemblage 1 consists of stacked coarsening-upward sequences composed, from base to top, of organic-rich shales (facies E, type I), laminated siltstones (facies A) and current-rippled laminated sandstones (facies B). Units of assemblage 1 record progradation of small mouth-bar deltas within a perennial open lacustrine system under temperate and humid conditions. Facies assemblage 2 lacks a clear vertical pattern and consists of interbedded fine-grained carbonates and siltstones (facies C); deformed and wave-reworked sandstones (facies D); organic-rich shales (facies E, type II) and clayey mudstones (facies F). The assemblage also represents a perennial, hydrologically-open, shallow lacustrine system, but characterized by strong seasonal climatic control. Water stratification probably occurred in several periods of the lake history. Pangaean megamonsoonal influence is envisaged to explain the strong seasonality imprint evidenced toward the upper part of the Tanzhuang lacustrine column.					xianghong, zhang/JRY-8704-2023														0921-2728					FEB	1994	11	1					41	65		10.1007/BF00683270	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00683270													WOS:000208333600005
J	POLLARD, D; SCHULZ, M				POLLARD, D; SCHULZ, M			A MODEL FOR THE POTENTIAL LOCATIONS OF TRIASSIC EVAPORITE BASINS DRIVEN BY PALEOCLIMATIC GCM SIMULATIONS	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												A simple model of evaporite basins is driven by seasonal meteorological forcing from general circulation model (GCM) simulations of the Triassic climate. The basin model bridges the gap between the GCM meteorology and (some of) the physical processes involved in evaporite deposition that are not included in the GCM. It serves as an explicit objective link between the large-scale GCM results and the small-scale occurrences of a particular climate proxy. The model consists of a single column of saline lake water at each GCM grid point. Negative annual precipitation minus evaporation at the lake surface is interpreted as a necessary condition for the formation of Triassic evaporite deposits. Good agreement is found between observed and predicted evaporite sites in the Carnian, (225 Ma), with less agreement in the Scythian (245 Ma). We suggest that some of the disagreements may be due to the lack of small-scale topography and the lack of ocean dynamics in the GCM. The basic approach of using secondary land-surface models in conjunction with GCM meteorology could also be profitable for other paleoclimatic proxies such as coal, bauxites and karsts. We briefly discuss the importance of more objective methods for validating model maps against observed proxy distributions, the desirability of predicting both necessary and sufficient conditions for proxy formation, and uncertainties due to spatially incomplete geologic sampling.

Seasonal starch allocation of starry stonewort (Nitellopsis obtusa) growing in lake Koronis, MN	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Starry stonewort (Nitellopsis obtusa) (Desvaux in Loiseleur) J. Groves is an invasive macro alga that can take over entire water columns and outcompete native species. Previous research has quantified seasonal life history and phenology but there is no research quantifying carbohydrate allocation. The current study utilized samples harvested from Lake Koronis, Minnesota, USA from 2020 and 2021 to quantify starch allocation patterns in N. obtusa. Starch was quantified using the amylase/amyloglucosidase method. Starch data were compared to light transmittance (%), pH and water temperature (degrees C) via mixed procedures models in SAS. Seasonal average low and high points of starch storage were observed to be June (3.3%) and April (9.9%) for thalli biomass then June (41.7%) and November (54.6%) for bulbils. In regard to allocation patterns, above ground thalli reallocates carbohydrate stores to the below ground rhizoids in May. Carbohydrates are then transported to bulbils from July through September as rhizoid starch decreases and the bulbil starch increases. Ultimately, the carbohydrates are converted to starch and stored in bulbils (21.0-73.7%). In its invaded range, bulbils are important for energy store, vegetative reproduction and spread, as well as temporal distribution. These bulbils spread easily, spread rapidly, can store a lot of energy (73% starch), and are a major concern for the invasion of N. obtusa. Water temperature and light availability were shown to negatively influence starch content of thalli. These findings suggest that in the invaded range, N. obtusa is capable of accumulating large amounts of starch later into the growing season. The energy reserves may give N. obtusa a competitive advantage over native species by allowing a longer growing season resulting in the production of more vegetative propagules and greater longevity in the environments it invades.

J	Schloesser, DW				Schloesser, DW			Distribution and seasonal abundance of trematode parasites (Trematoda: Allocreadiidae: Crepidostomum spp.) in burrowing-mayfly nymphs (Ephemeroptera: Ephemeridae: Hexagenia spp.) from connecting rivers of the Laurentian Great Lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Burrowing-mayfly nymphs such as Hexagenia spp. have been used extensively in North America and Europe as a biomonitoring tool to indicate mesotrophic water quality, yet infestation by associated parasites has not been well documented. We performed laboratory analysis of archived samples of Hexagenia spp. nymphs collected in 1985 and 1986 to provide base-line data on the distribution (1985) and seasonal infestation (1986) of the trematode parasite Crepidostomum spp. in Hexagenia spp. nymphs in connecting rivers between Lakes Superior and Erie of the Laurentian Great Lakes. In May and June 1985, frequency of occurrence of metacercariae was widely distributed throughout the connecting rivers (63% of 203 stations with nymphs), except in areas where nymph densities were relatively low (i.e., <= 69 nymphs/m(2)). Distribution was probably underestimated in the present study because of low probability (mean = 31%, range 0-57%) of detecting infestation in a small number of collected nymphs (<= 10) at nymph densities <= 69/m(2). In 1986, seasonal infestation between April and October occurred in 3.3% (627) of 18696 nymphs. Overall prevalence, mean intensity, and mean abundance of parasites at one station in the St. Marys River indicate parasite transmission occurred between June and September. This period of transmission is dependent on the life-cycle of the parasite. In addition, the life-cycle of Hexagenia spp. determines which annual cohort of nymphs is infested and therefore, the duration of infestation. Although, no impacts of infestation on Hexagenia spp. nymphs were observed in the present study, infestation intensities were high enough (>= 25 metacercariae per nymph) at one station in the St. Marys River to potentially cause tissue damage in a high proportion (53%) of infested nymphs.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT 1	2005	548						177	189		10.1007/s10750-005-4755-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-4755-4													WOS:000232760900016

To facilitate tracking the impacts of anthropogenic emissions on air quality, acidic deposition, and surface water quality, the National Atmospheric Deposition Program, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, and Adirondack Lake Survey Corporation have been monitoring ambient sulfur dioxide and aerosol sulfate levels, and anion and cation concentrations in wet deposition and lake water over the past few decades. In this paper, we discuss the seasonality and year-to-year variability, and illustrate some of the complexities in estimating temporal trends in these data. The periods of analysis extended through 2000, beginning in 1991 for the ambient air quality data, 1978 for the wet deposition data, and 1982 for the lake water quality data. While the lake water SO42- concentrations appear to be decreasing gradually, the air concentration data appear to have changed abruptly in the 1990s and the precipitation-weighted concentrations exhibited both gradual and sharp decreases during the same period.

Catch composition in terms of species representation and mass was compared over time and depth (10, 30, 50, 75, 100 and 125 m). The average catch per unit effort was calculated per species and depth. Haplochromine cichlids dominated the catches at every depth, making up 75 to 92% of the biomass. The remainder was made almost exclusively of catfishes. Despite catching more than 140 species in the trawls, 60 to 80% of the catches consisted of ten or fewer species, including three catfishes. About twenty species accounted for 90 to 95% of the catches at any depth, suggesting that many species are uncommon or rare. Previous authors reported dramatic changes in species composition at 50 in in the southwest arm. Data presented here suggest that this might be due to a change in the nature of the substratum at 50 m. The greatest diversity of species is in shallow waters, but the highest catches in terms of biomass were recorded between 50 and 125 m and peaked at 75 and 100 m. As catches in the deep waters were dominated by fishes with favorable life history, characteristics and which are large relative to species in the shallow waters (though the largest species of cichlid occur in the shallow water, the catches are dominated by small species), it is recommended that the possibility for increased exploitation of the SWA deep demersal stocks should be explored by encouraging controlled development of a demersal commercial fishery in the SWA.					; Duponchelle, Fabrice/K-1998-2016	DUPONCHELLE, Fabrice/0000-0003-0497-2264; 													0380-1330						2003	29			2			216	231		10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70550-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70550-4													WOS:000221126800017
