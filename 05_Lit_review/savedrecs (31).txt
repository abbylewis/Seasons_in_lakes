Introduced northern pike consumption of salmonids in Southcentral Alaska	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												The impacts of introduced northern pike (Esox lucius) on salmonid populations have attracted much attention because salmonids are popular subsistence, sport and commercial fish. Concern over the predatory effects of introduced pike on salmonids is especially high in Southcentral Alaska, where pike were illegally introduced to the Susitna River basin in the 1950s. We used pike abundance, growth, and diet estimates and bioenergetics models to characterise the realised and potential consumptive impacts that introduced pike (age 2 and older) have on salmonids in Alexander Creek, a tributary to the Susitna River. We found that juvenile salmonids were the dominant prey item in pike diets and that pike could consume up to 1.10 metric tons (realised consumption) and 1.66 metric tons (potential consumption) of juvenile salmonids in a summer. Age 3-4 pike had the highest per capita consumption of juvenile salmonids, and age 2 and age 3-4 pike had the highest overall consumption of juvenile salmonid biomass. Using historical data on Chinook salmon and pike potential consumption of juvenile salmonids, we found that pike consumption of juvenile salmonids may lead to collapsed salmon stocks in Alexander Creek. Taken together, our results indicate that pike consume a substantial biomass of juvenile salmonids in Alexander Creek and that coexistence of pike and salmon is unlikely without management actions to reduce or eliminate introduced pike.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				OCT	2015	24	4					519	531		10.1111/eff.12164	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12164													WOS:000361010500003

In this study, an assessment on lake water quality was carried out in Lake Heviz and its effluent, to provide valuable information about the present lake water quality in the winter season. In Heviz, the thermal lake has an economic, geological and medical significance, and plays an important role in the tourism industry. Monitoring the quality of water resources - where thermal waters are present - is of primary importance. The chemical composition of geothermal waters often differs markedly from surface waters. The direct drainage of used geothermal waters getting into freshwaters is usually not authorized, so the excess thermal water of Lake Heviz dilutes in the outflow effluent. A principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to explore the surface water quality dataset. Three sampling points were chosen from the effluent characterized by different water temperatures. The study took place between 9th December, 2019 and 16th March, 2020. There were 9 sampling times to measure conductivity, pH, biological and chemical oxygen demand, total organic carbon, ammonium-, phosphate-, sulphate concentration at the same sampling time. The highest water quality values were determined in the third sampling point of the outflow effluent, where the water temperature was the lowest. Temperature is an important factor in the aquatic environment since it affects directly or indirectly the aquatic flora and fauna. This study is important in providing comprehensive information on water quality for decision makers in particular the thermal waters and valuable reference for international researchers.

It flows through Harbin city with 66 km long, locating in the northern China with a longer winter time. This paper aimed to study concentration distributions, stability, risk assessment, and source apportionment of heavy metals including chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and nickel (Ni) in 11 selected sections of the Songhua River Harbin region. Results showed that Cr, Cd, Pb, Hg, and As exceeded their respective geochemical background values in sediments of most monitoring sections. Compared with other important rivers and lakes in China, Cr, Hg, Cd, and As pollutions in surface sediments were above medium level. Further analysis of chemical speciation indicated that Cr and As in surface sediments were relatively stable while Pb and Cd were easily bioavailable. Correlation analysis revealed sources of these metals except As might be identical. Pollution levels and ecological risks of heavy metals in surface sediments presented higher in the mainstream region (45 degrees 47.0' N similar to 45 degrees 53.3' N, 126 degrees 37.0' E similar to 126 degrees 42.1' E). Source apportionment found Hejiagou and Ashi River were the main contributors to metal pollution of this region. Thus, anthropogenic activities along the Hejiagou and Ashi River should be restricted in order to protect the Songhua River Harbin region from metal contamination.

Here we examine a negatively buoyant plume entering Lake Superior from the Ontonagon River during late March 2000. Because of small temperature related density differences, the sediment load carried by the river made an appreciable contribution to the plume-edge density field and significantly impacted plume-edge dynamics. Particle-related density gradients were responsible for roughly one-third of the geostrophic velocity shear at the plume edge. As a result of the small width (50 m) of the Ontonagon River mouth, the emerging river water was not deflected by rotational effects. Its movement appeared to have been primarily controlled by the wind-driven coastal current. Our analysis indicates that the frequent reversals of this current should effectively limit the plume's alongshore extent and may result in a continuous coastal band of turbid water extending alongshore in either direction from the river mouth.

It also left a time-stratigraphic marker in western El Salvador and adjacent Guatemala-the Ilopango Tierra Blanca Joven, or TBJ tephra. Mineral suites and major element abundances identify a silicic volcanic ash in cores from Lago de Yojoa, Honduras, as Ilopango TBJ. This extends its reported range more than 150 kin to the northeast. Analyses of glass from the TBJ tephra from the Chalchuapa archaeological site, El Salvador, and from Lago de Yojoa, Honduras, establish the first major element reference fingerprint for the TBJ tepbra. The Lago de Yojoa cores also hold two previously undated trachyandesitic tephra layers originating from the nearby Lake Yojoa Volcanic Field.

Female host sex-biased parasitism with the rodent stomach nematode Mastophorus muris in wild bank voles (Myodes glareolus)	PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH												Abundance and prevalence of helminth infections often differ between host sexes, and are usually biased in favor of males. Relatively few cases of female-biased parasitism have been reported. We sampled bank voles in three woodland sites in N.E. Poland over 11 years at 3-4-year intervals, and assessed their parasite burdens. Prevalence and abundance of the stomach nematode Mastophorus muris were consistently higher among females. Among adult female bank voles from the two sites that showed the highest prevalence with M. muris, both prevalence and abundance were significantly higher in lactating bank voles, but not pregnant animals, and the effect of lactation was evident in both sites, in all four surveys, and in both age classes. Although the magnitude of the effect of lactation varied between years, it was not confounded by any significant interactions with other factors. We hypothesize that mature and reproductively active female bank voles are subject to higher exposure compared with males of similar age, as a consequence of the increased content of invertebrates in their diet, including the intermediate hosts of M. muris, required to meet the higher increased energy and protein demands of nursing litters throughout the summer months.					; Behnke-Borowczyk, Jolanta/ABI-7276-2020; Behnke, Jerzy/L-6176-2015; Grzybek, Maciej/D-7395-2013	Bajer, Anna/0000-0001-6199-8458; Behnke-Borowczyk, Jolanta/0000-0003-2085-038X; Grzybek, Maciej/0000-0002-8780-0304													0932-0113	1432-1955				FEB	2015	114	2					523	533		10.1007/s00436-014-4214-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-014-4214-0								25395256					WOS:000348566000018

Little research has examined in situ microplastic ingestion by dreissenid mussels, or the relationship between microplastics and chemical contaminants. We measured microplastics and chemical contaminants in mussel tissue from Milwaukee Harbor (Lake Michigan, United States) harvested from reference locations and sites influenced by wastewater effluent and urban river discharge. Mussels were deployed in cages in the summer of 2018, retrieved after 30 and 60 days, sorted by size class, and analyzed for microplastics and body burdens of three classes of contaminants: alkylphenols, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and petroleum biomarkers. Microplastics in mussels were higher in the largest mussels at the wastewater-adjacent site after 30 days deployment. However, there was no distinction among sites for microplastics in smaller mussels, and no differences among sites after 60 days of deployment. Microplastics and chemical contaminants in mussels were not correlated. Microplastics have a diversity of intrinsic and extrinsic factors which influence their ingestion, retention, and egestion by mussels, and which vary relative to chemicals. While dreissenid mussels may not serve as plastic pollution biomonitors like they can for chemical contaminants, microplastics in dreissenid mussels are widespread, variable, and have unknown effects on physiology, mussel-mediated ecosystem processes, and lake food webs. These data will inform our understanding of the spatial distribution of microplastics in urban freshwaters, the role of dreissenid mussels in plastic budgets, and models for the fate of plastic pollution.

A possible mechanism underlying this phenomenon is higher mobility of large-bodied predators, which allows broad spatial scale foraging across habitats. If top predators foraging flexibly across habitats display an enhanced capacity for mobility, they should have increased blood circulation requirements compared with other organisms in a food web. Blood circulation capacity can be estimated from the relative size of the heart ventricle, the muscle mass that powers the cardiac pump. We sampled wild teleost fish in a freshwater lake food web to investigate the relationship between relative heart ventricle size and individual measures of trophic position, energy channel use (littoral versus pelagic), and foraging flexibility (coupling) estimated from N-15 and C-13 stable isotope signatures. The results showed that relative ventricle size is associated with increased relative trophic position and decreased use of littoral carbon across species, but not within species, in this system. The foraging flexibility required for coupling was not associated with heart ventricle size.

'Tough Love': Richard Pound, David D'Alessandro, and the Salt Lake City Olympics Bid Scandal	SPORT IN HISTORY												In late 1998, the IOC was gripped in a state of crisis by allegations that the Salt Lake City bid committee used cash, college scholarships and other benefits to entice some IOC members to support the city in its ultimately successful quest to host the 2002 Olympic Winter Games. An engaged international media flayed the IOC relentlessly through to March 1999 until the organization expelled a number of its members who had contravened its rules. The IOC's recovery operation took a calendar year, and eventually encompassed fifty reform measures to its Olympic Charter. This paper explores the efforts of (then) IOC Vice-President and Marketing Commission Chairman Richard Pound to manage discussions with anxious CEOs of the IOC's major corporate sponsors. Pound dedicated much time to dialogue with the most vociferous, and critical, of the CEOs, John Hancock's David D'Alessandro. We examined archival and newspapers sources to assess the key roles Pound and D'Alessandro played in the IOC's efforts to confront the crisis. Pound's credibility with the sponsors and media served the IOC well, while D'Alessandro's strident criticism afforded the IOC leadership no opportunity to back away from meaningful reform.																			1746-0263	1746-0271					2006	26	1					64	90		10.1080/17460260600661257	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17460260600661257													WOS:000212750100004

In this paper, a detailed three-dimensional (3-D) investigation of the current and thermal structures during the upwelling event was conducted using in situ observations, remote sensing products, and the results of a long-term numerical simulation. A 3-D finite-volume coupled ice-ocean model tailored for the Laurentian Great Lakes was employed for this purpose. The model was validated with temperature observations at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration buoys and mooring data from 2010. The upwelling event observed in satellite imagery and at a mooring station was reproduced by the model, showing a cooling of as much as 10 degrees C in August 2010 along the northwestern coast. The relationship between the alongshore wind and the offshore thermocline displacement (upwelling front) derived in theoretical work (Csanady, 1977, ) was used to calculate upwelling front movement offshore and found to be in in close agreement with model prediction. A significant correlation between alongshore wind stress and lake temperature change in the upwelling zone was found with a correlation coefficient of -0.87. A simple linear heat balance model explained most of variability in temperature.					; Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/AAA-5852-2021	Kessler, James/0000-0001-8643-7569; Wang, Jia/0000-0003-4154-9721; Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/0000-0001-5466-6332; Beletsky, Dmitry/0000-0003-4532-0588; Austin, Jay/0000-0002-3580-1794; Bai, Peng/0000-0003-0313-2829													2169-9275	2169-9291				MAY	2021	126	5							e2020JC016512	10.1029/2020JC016512	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JC016512													WOS:000654462400045

Therefore, it makes sense to process captured data locally at IoT edge node to avoid latency. In Edge Computing, the Gateway stores data and perform computations along with traffic aggregation and routing. While Edge analytics allows pre-processing and filtering of the data closer to where it's being created but the data which falls within normal range can be stored in low cost IoT storage and abnormal readings will be sent to Data Lake or in-memory database. Edge Computing will boost traditional Cloud computing model with service nodes placed at the network edges. It will help traditional data center cloud models by reducing latency and increased bandwidth. In future computation and data processing power will slowly shift towards edge devices like sensors, drones, driverless cars etc. Playing augmented reality, 3D video games, content-based video analysis is a challenge on mobile phone due to limited processing power and battery life. Realtime analysis of massive sensor data is needed in industries like manufacturing, mining, transportation to detect anomalies and send alerts. Therefore, Edge Computing and Cloud computing are likely to follow more of a hybrid approach and complement each other. This paper talks about Edge computing architecture, computational offloading approaches, Edge Computing challenges and benefits etc.					Singh, Sachchidanand/AAD-5365-2020																978-1-5090-6593-6				2017							49	53																WOS:000452167100009

Physical and temporal factors controlling the development of near-surface ground ice at Illisarvik, western Arctic coast, Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Near-surface permafrost was sampled in summer 2010 at 26 sites in the Illisarvik drained-lake basin and nine sites in the surrounding tundra on Richards Island, NWT, to investigate the growth of segregated near-surface ground ice. Permafrost and ground ice have developed in the lake basin since drainage in 1978. The lake bed soils are predominantly silts of varying moisture and organic-matter contents, with sandier soils near the lake margins. Excess-ice contents in the basin were also variable, and ice enrichment was observed to a maximum depth of 60 cm below the 2010 permafrost table. Shrub-covered, wet areas had the highest mean excess-ice content in the top 50 cm of permafrost (10%), while grassy, dryer areas (4%) and poorly vegetated marginal areas (<1%) were less enriched with ice. Site wetness was the most important variable associated with near-surface excess-ice content in the lake basin. Silt content was a secondary variable. Mean excessice content in the top 50 cm of permafrost at tundra sites (25%) was much greater than in the basin, with ice enrichment to greater depths, likely a result of the time available for permafrost aggradation since the early Holocene climatic optimum.

The growth, coverage and nutrient content of the three plants were studied, and chemical analyses were performed according to standard methods. The maximum standing crops measured for each plant were 1.9, 18.2 and 3.3 kg m(-2), respectively, and their average nutrient concentrations were 2.1, 1.2 and 1.7 g P kg(-1) and 12.1, 11.7 and 10.1 g N kg(-1), respectively. A multiple harvest of Iris pseudacorus revealed that the removal of nutrients could be increased up to 50% for N and 100% for P compared with a single harvest. Biomass decomposition assays showed high values for five-day biochemical oxygen demand (115-207 mg O-2 g(-1), depending on the plant and its age) and a substantial release of phosphorus, up to 100% of that contained in the biomass, highlighting the need to remove the litter fall. This study provides key aspects for vegetation selection and management (planting and harvesting) in a novel application of constructed wetlands to enhance water quality and biodiversity.

According to the chemical data, in the summer of 2019, the content of nutrients in the water was, relatively, not high; the content of heavy metals was very low. Twenty-seven species were found in zooplankton. The average abundance of zooplankton was 988.8 thousand ind./m(3)with a biomass of 1.52 g/m(3). Rotifera dominated. Cladocera sub-dominated. The Shannon index values were 2.31 bit/ind. and 2.57 bit/mg; the values of Clarke's W-statistics and Delta-Shannon were negative. The abundance of zooplankton increased more than nine times, but the average individual mass of an organism decreased from 0.0112 to 0.0016 mg over the past decade. Despite the relatively low content of nutrients, the structure of zooplankton demonstrated that the nutritional load on Lake Borovoe is currently close to critical. Statistical mapping of the data and redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that the primary source of lake pollution is the village of Borovoe and sanatoriums located on the southeast and northwest coasts.					; Krupa, Elena/I-7537-2019	Krupa, Elena/0000-0001-9401-0258; Yakovleva, Natalya/0000-0003-1101-9543; Sadvakasov, Erlan/0000-0003-1576-8250														2073-4441				SEP	2020	12	9							2580	10.3390/w12092580	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12092580													WOS:000580547700001

The number of yellow perch per gill net remained low even after over 59,000 adult perch were stocked in 1994. However, the number of bluegill collected per hour of night electrofishing increased from <20 prior to 1997 (when 102,800 25-50 mm bluegills were stocked) and has typically been <40 since then. The mean number of common carp collected per gill net remained low in all years and protection of northern pike greater than or equal to710 mm. with a maximum length limit may have aided in controlling carp recruitment. Bioenergetic modeling revealed that the 2001 northern pike population consumed between 49,000 and 77,000 yellow perch, suggesting that these predators can substantially reduce perch abundance.					; Willis, David/D-3400-2009	Paukert, Craig/0000-0002-9369-8545; 													0270-5060					MAR	2003	18	1					13	24		10.1080/02705060.2003.9663947	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2003.9663947													WOS:000181291800002

This is the first scientific sample from a landlocked charr population from Svalbard. We found a very prominent modal group of large, old and sexually adult fish of both sexes. Their length ranged from 15 to 62 cm, but 92% of the fish were longer than 40 cm and 62% of them fell in the 45 to 54 cm interval. The age range was 7 to 31 years, but 93% were 14 years or older and represented 18 year-classes. The length-at-age of the charr seemed to increase steadily until they reached the size and age of the modal group. The growth rate decreased sharply after that. The mortality rates within the age span of the modal group seemed to be low. The ages at first spawning for most of the charr in the sample were between 7 and 9 years and spawning cycles of two years were indicated.																			0800-0395					DEC	1997	16	2					85	92		10.1111/j.1751-8369.1997.tb00250.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-8369.1997.tb00250.x													WOS:000072138000002

DOCUMENTATION OF A SUDDEN KARSTIC LAKE DRAINAGE EVENT IN THE SHULGAN RIVER VALLEY (SOUTHERN URAL, RUSSIA)	JOURNAL OF CAVE AND KARST STUDIES												This article presents hydrological, hydrogeochemical, and mineralogical features of karstic lakes located in the basin of the disappearing, karstic Shulgan River (southern Ural, Russia). The lakes are currently isolated from karstic channels by bottom sediments; for several decades, their levels were relatively stable. We document a case of a "breakthrough" drainage event (occurring approximately once every 50 years), which occurred in 2021-2022 and the subsequent recovery of one of the lakes, Lake Ygyshma. Thanks to hydrological monitoring at the Goluboe Ozero spring and in the Shulgan-Tash Cave, it was possible to record the time of the breakthrough and the time of lake water transit, confirming the hydrogeological connection between lakes and the underground Shulgan River. This paper proposes a conceptual model of the evolution of isolated karstic lakes and the formation of the unconventional (for epigenic carbonate karst) hydrogeochemical characteristics in them (enrichment with metals, gases, etc.).

Biological Pump Control of the Fate and Distribution of Hydrophobic Organic Pollutants in Water and Plankton	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The goal of this study was to experimentally assess the coupling between primary producer biomass dynamics and the distribution and fate of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in a lake pelagic ecosystem. This was done by following the short-term evolution of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations in water and biota (phytoplankton and zooplankton) and the variability of bioconcentration (BCF), biomagnification (BMF), and bioaccumulation (BAF) factors during the development of a typical spring ecological progression in which the phytoplankton bloom is followed by a peak in the zooplankton abundance. The bulk of compounds with log K-ow > 6.5 in the lake epilimnion was mainly associated with primary producer biomass. The phytoplankton biological pump was a major driver of POP export from the epilimnion, causing the decline of dissolved-phase concentrations. The BCF of phytoplankton for the more hydrophobic PCBs showed minima during the period of biomass climax. The concentration in the zooplankton of all selected PCBs sharply declined from March to May, with BAFs having minima in the post algal bloom phase. Biomagnification occurred during the pre algal bloom and algal bloom phases but appeared to be absent during the post algal bloom. This study highlights the occurrence of a prompt and complex response in the fate and distribution of POPs to dynamic biogeochemical control. Within the frame of the ecological succession, phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass dynamics produced bioaccumulation metrics varying over 1-2 orders of magnitude in the time frame of a few weeks and resulted in reduced trophic web exposure.					; Nizzetto, Luca/B-6059-2019; Dachs, Jordi/LOU-0520-2024; Pomati, Francesco/G-2367-2010; Bettinetti, Roberta/AAD-7072-2019; Jones, Kevin/F-4296-2014; li, jun/C-4943-2012; Li, Jun/C-4943-2012	Borga, Katrine/0000-0002-8103-3263; Nizzetto, Luca/0000-0003-1400-657X; Bettinetti, Roberta/0000-0001-7481-6190; Dachs, Jordi/0000-0002-4237-169X; Jones, Kevin Christopher/0000-0001-7108-9776; Li, Jun/0000-0002-3637-1642													0013-936X	1520-5851				MAR 20	2012	46	6					3204	3211		10.1021/es204176q	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es204176q								22313235					WOS:000301630200023

However, solar energy penetration in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and its capital Sarajevo, is not in line with the possibilities. Furthermore, the Sarajevo Canton is extremely polluted during the winter months because of the use of unacceptable heating fuel. The aim of this paper is to introduce photovoltaic power systems use in heating electrification system. In this paper AQI is calculated based on historical data and the hybrid model EMD-SARIMA for air pollution and a solar production forecast is presented. The methodology was tested in the Sarajevo Canton, taking into account 35,000 households. In order to ensure clean air, renewable electric energy use for household heating should be implemented. The widespread use of inefficient individual heating systems characterized by inefficient and expensive use of firewood and the use of coal in individual furnaces in populated areas are the main problems of internal and urban air pollution in Sarajevo Canton. In order to reduce energy poverty in Sarajevo Canton, the use of a floating photovoltaic power plant located on Lake Jablanica with a capacity of 30 MW and the solar prosumers with capacity of 115 MW to provide the 196 GWh necessary for heating electrification of 35,000 households is implemented in this paper. Finally, based on correlation between AQI forecast and solar production it was calculated that the values of the AQI, considering the application of solar energy during 150 days (five months) in one heating season, have significantly decreased. Also renewable energy sources have a very important role in reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions into the atmosphere and reducing urban pollution. With this approach, households would be heated by renewable electricity, which would make Sarajevo a cleaner, smarter city.

J	WARREN, CR				WARREN, CR			TERMINAL ENVIRONMENT, TOPOGRAPHIC CONTROL AND FLUCTUATIONS OF WEST GREENLAND GLACIERS	BOREAS												Glaciers are commonly regarded as sensitive indicators of climatic change, but iceberg calving can partially decouple glacier oscillations from climatic forcing. Recent fluctuations (1942-85) of 72 West Greenland outlet glaciers were studied using aerial photographs, and nine of them examined in the field. Despite similar climatic forcing, variable glacier behaviour is apparent. Eighty-four percent of the land-terminating glaciers have been retreating or stable during the period, whereas more than half the tidewater and lake terminating glaciers have been advancing. The calving glaciers exhibit much greater variability in frontal behaviour. Patterns of change suggest that the land-terminating glaciers are controlled dominantly by variations in summer temperature, but that calving dynamics have caused the tidewater and lake-calving glaciers to respond to climatic change in non-linear ways. Dynamic and response contrasts are apparent between freshwater and tidewater glaciers. Trough geometry is of great significance in controlling the nature and magnitude of frontal change of calving glaciers; in particular, topographic 'pinning points' represent potentially stable locations within the fjord at which stillstands almost invariably occur, irrespective of climatic change or regional trends.

Study focus: To date, there has been no research in the KDR that investigates the interconnections among thermal stratification (ThS), water quality, and nutrients, based on field measurements. This study explored the temporal trend of ThS in the KDR and its interrelationship with water quality parameters based on data measured from 2005-2006. New hydrological insights for the region: The results showed that a noticeable ThS in the KDR starts in late April and continues until early December. The strongest ThS occurs during late summer when the water temperature difference between the surface and bottom layers in the reservoir exceeds 18 degrees C. As a result of external forces that generally intensify in December, vertical water circulation occurs, and by January and February there is a minimal temperature gradient between the surface and bottom layers. During ThS, dissolved oxygen (DO) is strongly confined by the metalimnion and does not penetrate into the hypolimnion. However, even during late December to February, there is a large difference between DO concentration in the surface and bottom layers, which indicates limited mixing. Ammonium increasing and nitrate decreasing with depth was observed, likely due to denitrification (in the bottom layers) and nitrification (in the surface layers), respectively. The results of the present study provide new information on the spatio-temporal variation of water quality in large reservoirs, which is important for stakeholders with concerns related to lake and reservoir eutrophication and water quality issues.					; Rabiee Abyaneh, Maryam/D-3021-2019; Berndtsson, Ronny/C-7449-2015	Berndtsson, Ronny/0000-0003-1473-0138; Rabiee Abyaneh, Maryam/0000-0003-3951-9785; 														2214-5818				OCT	2018	19						279	286		10.1016/j.ejrh.2018.10.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2018.10.003													WOS:000451164000019

Custom-designed VNIR spectrometer systems, UAVSpec and UAVSpec2, mounted onboard a helicopter, were used for the measurements. We show that broadleaved and coniferous forests react to changes in water supply differently: the relative change of the NIR reflectance was equally about 10-15% in all stands, while the change of visible reflectance of coniferous stands exceeded that of broadleaved stands. The smallest change was observed for broadleaved stands in the red reflectance, i.e. chlorophyll absorption bands. Based on our results, we conclude that the change of stand reflectance caused by weather conditions, such as drought, should be taken into account in the estimation of the optical properties of the atmosphere, needed in the atmospheric correction of optical satellite images. A widely used correction method directly benefiting from our results for boreo-nemoral forests is the dark object method.

In the coastal waters of British Columbia, Canada, the virus has been detected for 20 yr with many occurrences of mass mortalities among populations of Pacific herring Clupea pallasii (Valenciennes) and sardine Sardinops sagax as well as detections among cultured Atlantic Salmo salar and Chinook Oncorhynchus tshawytscha salmon. We compared nucleotide sequence of the full glycoprotein (G) gene coding region (1524 nt) of 63 VHSV isolates sampled during its recorded presence from 1993 to 2011 from 6 species and a total of 29 sites. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all isolates fell into sub-lineage IVa within the major VHSV genetic group IV. Of the 63 virus isolates, there were 42 unique sequences, each of which was ephemeral, being repeatedly detected at most only 1 yr after its initial detection. Multiple sequence types were revealed during single viral outbreak events, and genetic heterogeneity was observed within isolates from individual fish. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis revealed a close genetic linkage between VHSV isolates obtained from pelagic finfish species and farmed salmonids, providing evidence for virus transmission from wild to farmed fish.

J	Andersen, ST				Andersen, Svend Th.			History of the terrestrial environment in the Quaternary of Denmark	BULLETIN OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF DENMARK												Changes in the environment backward in time can be reconstructed by measurement of geophysical, geochemical or palaeolontological paramenters in sediment columns. Changes in the elemental spheres of the environment are forced by changes in insolation and by mutual interactions. The glacial-interglacial cycles are provoked by minima and maxima in insolation and reflect changes in biosphere and geosphere. The last summer insolation maximum in the Northern Hemisphere coincides with the beginning of the Holocene. Decreasing insolation affected the altitudes of the glacial equilibrium line and the tree line in Norway, and air humidity in Denmark. The reestablishment of deciduous woodland coincided with the temperature maximum. The introduction of agriculture caused increasing deforestation, especially in densely populated areas, where the agricultural exploitation expanded with increasing precipitation. The environment was increasingly affected by man up towards present time. The natural climate development may be changed by air pollution. Air pollution due to industrialisation is registered by increased deposition of airborne particles on bogs and in lakes, and pollution of aquatic environments by increased adduction of nutritional elements to freshwater lakes.																			0011-6297						1994	41		2				219	228																WOS:000204234900011

The effects of a sudden injection of anoxic bottom water into surface waters are well known, as well as the degradation of phytoplankton blooms and the release of phytoplankton toxins. However, in this study we report on a new, climate-related cause of fish kills in a shallow lake. We observed that a long period of drought in a hot summer followed by heavy rain resulted in a large input of labile organic matter. This was followed by a condition of whole-lake anoxia and fish kill in the lake basin receiving the input, while the second basin, immediately downstream, was left unaffected. To test the causal relationship between these events, an oxygen model calculated that respiration had increased by 230% following the organic input and caused whole-lake nocturnal anoxia for four days despite unaltered daytime photosynthesis. One year after the fish kill, roach and bream had migrated from the downstream lake basin and re-established dense populations, while large predatory perch and pike remained very few. This imbalance in the fish food webs may last for several years and in turn increase predation on zooplankton and release phytoplankton from grazing control.The prolonged effects of fish kills on fish and lake community structure demand further research, as weather-induced anoxia can be expected to become more common.

Multivariate statistical techniques using a wide range of chemical variables successfully reconstructed the late Holocene history of the Fish Lake watershed. Factor analysis identified six geomorphic mechanisms controlling the formation of sediments. Cluster analysis produced a grouping of core segments and discriminant analysis confirmed that 100% of the samples were correctly classified. The results indicated that the environmental history of the Fish Lake watershed in the past 6500 years can be divided into five phases. These are 6500-5700 years BP, 5700-1700 years BP, 1700-1000 years BP, 1000-600 years BP and 600 years BP to the present. In the Fish Lake watershed, during its time as a terrestrial system, the interactions of erosion, weathering, leaching, soil development, vegetation succession and climatic change have shaped the surrounding landscape as well as determined the evolution of the lake.

Within the stratigraphy of the cave three different volcanic ash layers occur (layer G, Fa and C-II). They are located in the middle section of the Mousterian (layer G), in between the Mousterian and Uluzzian layers (layer Fa) and on top of the Uluzzian horizons (layer C-II). The three tephra layers were chemically fingerprinted and correlated to well-known and precisely dated widespread Late Pleistocene tephra markers. Specifically, layer G, Fa and C-II were correlated to the X-6 (108.7 +/- 0.9 ka), Y-6 (45.5 +/- 1.0 ka) and Campanian Ignimbrite (39.85 +/- 0.14 ka), respectively. These findings provide robust chronological points allowing to conclude that: (i) the Mousterian occupation of the cave took place after the fall of the sea level following the MIS 5e high-stand; (ii) the Mousterian-Uluzzian boundary can be dated to 45.5 +/- 1.0 ka and climatostratigraphically firmly placed at the transition between the Greenland Inter-stadial 12 (GI12)-Greenland Stadial 12 (GS12); (iii) the Uluzzian lasted for at least five millennial spanning the GS12-GI9 period and ended at beginning of the Heinrich Event 4.

Snow-mediated ptarmigan browsing and shrub expansion in arctic Alaska	ECOSCIENCE												Large, late-winter ptarmigan migrations heavily impact the shoot, plant, and patch architecture of shrubs that remain above the snow surface. Ptarmigan browsing on arctic shrubs was assessed in the vicinity of Toolik Lake, on the north side of the Brooks Range in Alaska. Data were collected in early May 2007, at maximum snow depth, after the bulk of the ptarmigan migration had passed through the area. In an area of tall shrubs, half of the buds on Salix alaxensis were browsed by ptarmigan. Three percent of the buds that were buried beneath the snow were browsed, 90% of the buds that were less than 30 cm above the maximum snow level were browsed, and 45% of the buds above that height were browsed. Ptarmigan browsing was found to be a major height limiter for tall shrubs, thereby controlling shrub architecture by brooming stems at the snow surface and inducing stump shoots. These results were qualitatively extrapolated by photographing shrub morphology over a region approximately 300 km wide across a series of north-flowing arctic rivers with headwaters in the Brooks Range. Ptarmigan "hedging" of shrub patches, and shrub growth under a warmer climate, are opposing forces mediated by snow distribution.

SPACE TECHNOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL FORUM-STAIF 2004	AIP Conference Proceedings				Space Technology and Applications International Forum (STAIF 2004)	FEB 08-11, 2004	Albuquerque, NM	Boeing Co, Gen Autom, Lockheed Martin, Los Alamos Natl Lab, Northrop Grumman Space Technol, Sandia Natl Labs, US DOE				The foremost question for Martian exploration is where to find environments favorable for pre-biotic chemistry or the growth of primitive life. Hydrothermal systems are the most sought after targets because terrestrial life probably originated in such systems, while lake deposits provide another good environment for preservation of clues to astrobiological processes. Craters can be filled with surface water from outflow channels and valley networks to form lakes with accompanying sedimentation. The great depth of impact craters, up to several kilometers relative to the surrounding terrain, can also result in a source of water for lakes and hydrothermal systems from local aquifers. Therefore, large craters may represent giant Petri dishes culturing preexisting life on Mars and promoting biogeochemical processes. Landing sites must be identified in craters where processes, such as erosion, or excavation by later cratering events has provided access to the buried lake sediments and impact melt deposits.

J	REYNOLDSON, TB; HAMILTON, AL				REYNOLDSON, TB; HAMILTON, AL			HISTORIC CHANGES IN POPULATIONS OF BURROWING MAYFLIES (HEXAGENIA-LIMBATA) FROM LAKE ERIE BASED ON SEDIMENT TUSK PROFILES	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												One of the most dramatic recorded changes in benthic invertebrate community structure due to eutrophication was the elimination of the burrowing mayfly, Hexagenia limbata, from the western basin of Lake Erie. This was a catastrophic event occurring as a result of two periods of anoxia in the summers of 1953 and 1955. From the examination of sediment cores, the changes in historic populations of Hexagenia have been reconstructed from enumeration of mandibular tusks. The changes in the numbers of tusks found in the sediment cores from the western basin of Lake Erie agree well with known historic events but suggest that numbers found in the earliest field samples represent a considerable increase over historic populations. Cores taken from the central basin suggest that Hexagenia was formerly only found in a band around the shore, and populations never occurred in the offshore waters. It is suggested that this is strong evidence for the occurrence of brief periods of anoxia in the central basin of Lake Erie prior to cultural eutrophication.

To thrive in alkaline environments, alkaliphiles require special adaptations. This adaptation may have evolved metabolites which can be useful for biotechnological processes or other applications. In fact, certain metabolites are found unique to alkaliphiles or are effectively produced by alkaliphiles. This probably aroused the interest in metabolites of alkaliphiles. During recent years, many alkaliphilic microbes have been isolated, especially in countries having alkaline environments, like soda lakes. Even if the number of such isolated alkaliphiles is large, their metabolites have not yet been extensively analyzed and exploited. This is expected to come in the years ahead. So far, the focus of interests in metabolites from alkaliphiles falls into categories such as organic acids, ingredients for foodstuffs and cosmetics, antibiotics, and substances which modify properties of other materials used in industry. This chapter deals with biotechnologically important metabolites of alkaliphiles including compatible solutes, biosurfactants, siderophores, carotenoids, exopolysaccharides, and antimicrobial agents. It also covers the promising potential of alkaliphiles as sources of bioplastic raw materials. Moreover, an overview of the patent literature related to alkaliphiles is highlighted.																			0724-6145	1616-8542	978-3-030-49736-1; 978-3-030-49735-4				2020	172						157	193		10.1007/10_2019_96	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/10_2019_96	10.1007/978-3-030-49736-1							31240347					WOS:000610736800006

Lyngbya wollei in western Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We report on the emergence of the potentially toxic filamentous cyanobacterium, Lyngbya wollei as a nuisance species in western Lake Erie. The first indication of heavy L. wollei growth along the lake bottom occurred in September 2006, when a storm deposited large mats of L. wollei in coves along the south shore of Maumee Bay. These mats remained intact over winter and new growth was observed along the margins in April 2007. Mats ranged in thickness from 0.2 to 1.2 m and we estimated that one 100-m stretch of shoreline along the southern shore of Maumee Bay was covered with approximately 200 metric tons of L. wollei. Nearshore surveys conducted in July 2008 revealed greatest benthic L. wollei biomass (591 g/m(2)+/-361 g/m(2) fresh weight) in Maumee Bay at depth contours between 1.5 and 3.5 m corresponding to benthic irradiance of approximately 4.0-0.05% of surface irradiance and sand/crushed dreissenid mussel shell-type substrate. A shoreline survey indicated a generally decreasing prevalence of shoreline L. wollei mats with distance from Maumee Bay. Surveys of nearshore benthic areas outside of Maumee Bay revealed substantial L. wollei beds north along the Michigan shoreline, but very little L wollei growth to the east along the Ohio shoreline.

Paleohydrological evidence from a 30-year resolution Holocene biomarker δD record from Moossee, Switzerland	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The hydrological cycle intensifies under global warming, causing humid areas to become wetter. However, rising temperatures also amplify seasonal ecosystem dryness, complicating the link between temperature and hydroclimate. Such divergent mechanisms challenge generalizations like 'warm and wet' in paleoclimatology on a global scale. On a regional scale, knowledge about evapotranspiration in response to past warming and cooling is still limited, but highly relevant to understand future hydroclimate. Here, we analyse the hydrogen isotope composition (delta D) of aquatic and terrestrial biomarkers in varved sediments from Moossee, Switzerland, covering the past 7300 years at a temporal resolution of 30 years. Based on a dual biomarker approach, we reconstruct evapotranspiration at Moossee. Our data suggests that cool and wet conditions repeatedly favored rising lake levels and advancing glaciers in the Alps but lowered treelines, e.g. at the onset of the Neoglacial, dated to -5.5 cal ka BP. In contrast, warmer periods like the Mid Holocene or the Roman Warm Period were associated with dryness. Short-term hydrological fluctuations are partly explained by volcanic and solar forcings. Aside from an increased risk of strong convective rainfall and floods, paleohydrology provides robust evidence that an intensified hydrological cycle under global warming will substantially favor summer drought in Central Europe.

J	Andrabi, SH; Malik, A				Andrabi, Syed Humarah; Malik, Abdul			Variation in bacterial flora with nickel and in vitro analysis of the phytotoxic and genotoxic potential and oxidative stress induced by the lake sediments	TOXICOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY												Present study aims to evaluate the quality of freshwater lake sediments for physico-chemical parameters, inorganic and organic contaminants, variation in bacterial populations in different seasons as well as evaluating their biological effects through phytotoxic (Vigna radiata), and mutagenic (Ames Salmonella tester strains) assessments. Sediment samples contained potentially toxic elements (Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni and Zn) and organic pollutants including pharmaceutical drugs (spironolactone and kendomycin), phenylpropanes (2,4-di-tert-butylphenol), personal care items (17-pentatriacontene), aromatic hydrocarbons (1,7-diisopropyl naphthalene), and insecticides (chlorpyrifos). These pollutants are considered to be toxic to the biological system. Total aerobic heterotrophic counts ranged from 5.53 +/- 0.2 x 105 to 27.60 +/- 0.64 x 105 CFU/ml during summer. In view of the detrimental impact of contaminants, V. radiata seeds germinated at varying concentrations of sediment extract, showed reduced seedling vigor index, radicle and plumule length. Root tips of V. radiata seeds revealed oxidative damage. Solvent (hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate) extracted sediments induced mutagenicity in Ames Salmonella tester strains, with TA98 being the most sensitive. Sediment extract of chloroform revealed the maximum mutagenic potential compared to hexane and ethyl acetate. These findings highlight the ecological and genotoxic risk impact of sediment pollution, stressing the need for monitoring and prevention.																			0277-2248	1029-0486				AUG 9	2025	107	7					1247	1266		10.1080/02772248.2025.2521752	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02772248.2025.2521752													WOS:001517336700001

According to the first axis of Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA), 52% of the relationships between species and five most influential environmental variables with 36.2% of variances were explained. Although the first four variables, air temperature, water temperature, pH, and electrical conductivity had significant influence (P < 0.05) on species composition, the effect of dissolved oxygen (P = 0.47) was relatively low. Spearman correlation analyses indicated that some species had weak to strong positive correlation with electrical conductivity, whereas some others had a significant negative correlation with pH and redox potential. Only two species (Herpetocypris chevreuxi and Ilyocypris inermis) had strong correlation to the habitat type (P < 0.05). Unweighted Pair-Group Method using Arithmetic averages (UPGMA) clustered species into four groups based on their occurrences. Species with cosmopolitan characteristics displayed higher tolerances to environmental variables than noncosmopolitans or rare species. Indeed, four cosmopolitan species (Heterocypris incongruens, I. bradyi, Candona neglecta, and C. candida) had high Environmental Tolerance Index (ETI) values for at least six different environmental variables. Thus, cosmopolitans are highly adaptable within a wide range of environmental conditions and geographical distribution.

It is mostly gavel-bed, it is flashy, experiences frequent flooding and often causes trouble for the local communities as far as spring floods are concerned. At the mouth of the Lososina River there is one of the biggest Polish Carpathian artificial lakes-the Zywiecki Water Reservoir (ZWR). Since the Lososina. River transports mostly gravel as the bed load to the ZWR, in the early seventies it was partly canalized, especially in places where it passes the inhabited areas. The situation of the Lososina River before and after the engineering works is compared. Features such as changes in cross-section geometry, slope, granulometry and bed load transport balance were compared using archives and present-day studies. For the purpose of the study, old engineering projects and reports were used to find out the difference in the Lososina River behaviour.					; Słowik-Opoka, Ewa/AGS-3206-2022	Slowik-Opoka, Ewa/0000-0003-4829-9200; 													0144-7815						2004		288					326	331																WOS:000224836100040

Characterisation of freshwater and marine cyanobacteria in the Hokianga region, Northland, New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Lake Omapere, Northland, New Zealand, contributes significant inputs of freshwater to Hokianga Harbour, and is subject to toxic cyanobacterial blooms. During summer 2004, ADDA-ELISA analysis indicated microcystins were present in Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) in Hokianga Harbour, leading to farm closures. Once the bloom had abated, continued detection of low microcystin levels suggested toxin production may be from cyanobacteria in the harbour not the lake. In this study, 20 cyanobacterial strains were isolated from Lake Omapere, its outflow and Hokianga Harbour. Morphological and molecular data identified diverse cyanobacterial species (15 Oscillatoriales and five Nostocales), including close relatives of toxin producers. Genes associated with toxin production were not detected in any strains and their cellular extracts were not toxic to Artemia salina larvae. An in vitro feeding trial of Pacific oysters with a microcystin-producing Microcystis aeruginosa strain (CAWBG16) was undertaken. No microcystins were detected in the shellfish using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.					; Orlovich, David/L-8581-2013	Summerfield, Tina/0000-0003-1878-7019; Orlovich, David/0000-0002-9266-2188													0028-8330	1175-8805				JUN	2014	48	2					177	193		10.1080/00288330.2013.854814	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.2013.854814													WOS:000337582000003
J	MARTIN, NV				MARTIN, NV			SIGNIFICANCE OF FOOD HABITS IN BIOLOGY EXPLOITATION AND MANAGEMENT OF ALGONQUIN PARK ONTARIO LAKE TROUT	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Algonquin Park lake trout may be piscivorous or planktonivorous depending on the available food supply in the summer months. Plankton-feeding lake trout grow more slowly, do not reach as great a size or age as fish-feeders and mature at a smaller size and younger age. Trout transferred from a plankton-feeding to a fish-feeding population grow at a faster rate and extend their life span. Fisheries in planktonivorous populations return larger numbers of smaller and younger fish to the angler. A higher percentage of mature fish occurs in these fisheries. The catch is dependent on fewer year classes and year class strength is more variable. Yields in numbers-per-acre is higher in plankton-feeding populations but is comparable with fish-feeding populations in terms of pounds-per-acre. The implications of these findings in such management practices as size limits, catch limits and quotas, lake closures, and forage fish introductions are discussed.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1966	95	4					415	+		10.1577/1548-8659(1966)95[415:TSOFHI]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1966)95[415:TSOFHI]2.0.CO;2													WOS:A19668416400011

This can have implications for the water quality and ecological functioning of aquatic systems. We deployed three spectroradiometer WISPstations at three sites in Europe (Italy, Estonia, and Lithuania/Russia) to measure chlorophyll-a at high frequency. A heatwave in July 2019 occurred with record daily maximum temperatures over 40 degrees C in parts of Europe. The effects of the resulting storm that ended the heatwave were more discernable than the heatwave itself. Following the storm, chlorophyll-a concentrations increased markedly in two of the lakes and remained high for the duration of the summer while at one site concentrations increased linearly. Heatwaves and subsequent storms appeared to play an important role in structuring the phenology of the primary producers, with wider implications for lake functioning. Chlorophyll-a peaked in early September, after which a wind event dissipated concentrations until calmer conditions returned. Synoptic coordinated high frequency monitoring needs to be advanced in Europe as part of water management policy and to improve knowledge on the implications of climate change. Lakes, as dynamic ecosystems with fast moving species-succession, provide a prism to observe the scale of future change.

Human health may also be affected. To combat this threat the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Convention for Ballast Water and Sediments (BWMC) came into force in September 2017. U.S. Federal and IMO ballast water standards for discharged organisms stipulate discharge limits for different size classes of organisms. Several studies including recent trials aboard Great Lakes freighters have shown that many phytoplankton found in ballast water do not fall into the regulated 10-50 mu M size class. Such issues illustrate the need for new methods of assessing microorganism populations that will supersede laborious microscopy requiring rare technical expertise. Recent progress has been made in the use of DNA (deoxyribose nucleic acid)-based methods as a means of identifying the appearance of invasive species in aquatic environments. A significant advance has been the development of high throughput sequencing (HTS), which has expanded DNA barcoding, relating to an individual organism, into second generation sequencing (metabarcoding), capable of mapping whole populations of organisms in an environmental sample. Several recent studies of HTS in ships' ballast water, have shown that the technique has the capacity for detecting potentially harmful taxonomic groups and is capable of differentiating among water from different sources. The current study was undertaken to investigate the suitability (or otherwise) of HTS as a tool for ballast water management. Possible applications include improved risk assessment relating to invasive species. Feasibility for indicative testing for ballast water treatment efficacy was also addressed. However, pending analysis of treated samples, the current study was confined to a comparison of HTS and microscope counts in untreated samples. A correlation of visual and molecular taxonomic assignments of microorganisms found in the ballast water from different ports and during different seasons indicated that such a comparison was best conducted at Family level, although Principal Components Analysis showed that the two methods differed qualitatively among major taxonomic groups.

A negative correlation was recorded between the annual biomass production and the mean daily photon flux densities in an experimental setup in which the photon flux densities were experimentally manipulated (four different levels of artificial shading) and the photoperiod was relatively unaffected. At the lowest mean photon flux density, the maximum total biomass was reached earlier in the growing season (end of June) than at the other photon flux densities (mid-August). Tuber production started at the same time in all conditions (mid-June). The number of tubers produced per gram ash-free dry weight of above-ground biomass was highest for the conditions with the lowest mean daily photon flux density. However, the total number of tubers per square metre recorded at the end of the growing season was highest for the control (no artificial shading). It is concluded that tuber initiation occurs under long-day conditions and is not controlled by mean daily photon flux densities. Tuber growth is clearly related to differences in daily photosynthetic periods. Tubers compete with above-ground biomass for photosynthate. At the highest level of shading, the photosynthetic tissue was ultimately unable to sustain tuber growth and, as a consequence, net growth of the vegetation ceased. Regarding tuber numbers of P. pectinatus in late summer, it is concluded that the size of the tuber bank was negatively affected by shade in the experiments.																			0304-3770					FEB	1991	39	1-2					121	129		10.1016/0304-3770(91)90027-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(91)90027-3													WOS:A1991FC98500011
J	Liu, H; Zheng, L; Jiang, L; Liao, MW				Liu, Hai; Zheng, Liang; Jiang, Liang; Liao, Mingwei			Forty-year water body changes in Poyang Lake and the ecological impacts based on Landsat and HJ-1 A/B observations	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												With global warming and aggravation due to human activities, many lakes on Earth are facing a series of worsening environmental problems, such as shrinking areas and declining water quality. Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China, an important wetland in the world and the largest migratory bird habitat in Asia. The ecological environment of the lake has a widespread influence and has attracted international attention. It is necessary to use long-term frequent satellite observations to investigate the Poyang Lake due to its high-frequency fluctuations characteristics. However, most remote sensing data cover only a short period of time, which cannot reflect the long-term change to the Poyang Lake water, no satellite mission currently fits such requirements. Based on HJ-1A/B and Landsat data from 1989 to 2018, the dynamic changes in water quantity in Poyang Lake are monitored in this paper, and the influencing factors and ecological impacts of the changes are analyzed. The results show that in terms of the water area change trend, on the annual scale, the annual mean values of water area and water volume exhibit overall decreasing trends. The water area was the largest in 1998 at 4068.33 km(2) and smallest in 2014 at 899.68 km(2); the water volume was largest in 1992 at 25,810 million m(3) and smallest in 2014 at 5880 million m(3). On the monthly scale, the water area was the smallest in January, largest in July, and showed an increasing trend from January to July; subsequently, a decreasing trend was observed from August to January. The water volume was smallest in February, largest in July, and showed an increasing trend from February to July; then, a decreasing trend was observed from August to February. The water volume of Poyang Lake is affected by seasonal changes in precipitation, and the correlation coefficient between monthly precipitation and monthly water volume is 0.603 (P < 0.05). In summer, the water volume is affected by the water level in the Yangtze River; the construction of the Three Gorges Dam in the Yangtze River caused a prolonged duration of the low water period and an advanced low water period, which are also important factors affecting the water volume change. In terms of the impact of water volume on ecology, the relationship between water volume and NH3-N concentration is obvious, with a correlation coefficient of - 0.679 (P < 0.01). A large water volume will increase the lake water level, reduce the habitats for migratory birds, and provide food to fewer migratory birds.

Food habits of a small Florida black bear population in an endangered ecosystem	URSUS												The Highlands-Glades subpopulation (HGS) of Florida, USA, black bears (Ursus americanus floridanus) is small, genetically depauperate, and resides primarily within the endangered Lake Wales Ridge ecosystem, which has lost >85% of native habitat to land development. Habitat loss can reduce availability of critical natural foods and cause bears to increase reliance on anthropogenic foods (i.e., human-sourced); lands supporting the HGS are expected to lose >50% of remaining Florida black bear habitat in coming decades. We used scat analysis to describe seasonal food habits, investigate potential dietary responses to food shortages, and inform habitat conservation and human bear conflict management. Florida black bears in the HGS mostly relied on native soft and hard mast and invertebrates, which are all available in endangered scrub habitat communities. Corn dispensed at hunter-operated feeding stations was a dominant food item in scats; and other alternative foods, such as citrus fruit and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), were found in summer-collected scats when soft mast should have been prevailing. Results indicate bears may respond to soft mast shortages caused by mast failures or habitat loss by consuming anthropogenic foods (e.g., corn, deer chow, citrus fruit, and garbage), which could increase human bear conflicts. Florida carpenter ants (Camponotus floridanus) appeared to provide a reliable compensatory food during such shortages, but they are arboreal and largely dependent on imperiled bear habitat for proliferation. We strongly suggest remnant scrub and other communities rich in soft and hard mast-producing flora be targeted for acquisition and protection to ensure persistence of Florida black bears in this diverse ecosystem. We also suggest non-lethal actions to mitigate bear habituation to anthropogenic foods be implemented to minimize human bear conflicts and prevent unnecessary losses to the already small HGS. Our study should be repeated to investigate whether dietary shifts occur in response to impending habitat loss and to further inform population conservation, habitat protection, and conflict management.					; Murphy, Sean/AAM-4692-2021	Murphy, Sean/0000-0002-9404-8878; 													1537-6176	1938-5439					2017	28	1					92	104		10.2192/URSU-D-16-00031.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2192/URSU-D-16-00031.1													WOS:000409564500008

Eugene; Morrison, Wendy; Mendenhall, Warren			Nutrient Limitation on Phytoplankton Growth in the Upper Barataria Basin, Louisiana: Microcosm Bioassays	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												The Davis Pond Diversion (DPD) was constructed to divert Mississippi River (MR) water into the Barataria Basin to reduce the salinity in support of wetland restoration on the Louisiana coast. To assess the phytoplankton nutrient limitation in adjacent water systems and potential impacts of DPD, 12 seasonal nutrient-phytoplankton bioassay experiments were conducted from October 2003 to July 2004 using the natural phytoplankton assemblages from freshwater and brackish-water lakes, Cataouatche and Salvador, LA (USA), which receive Mississippi River water from the DPD, and from a nearby freshwater lake, Lac des Allemands, that does not. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and silicate (Si) were added with different combinations at Redfield ratios in 10-l microcosms. Nitrogen was found to be the sole or primary limiting nutrient in all 12 experiments. N and P colimitations were found in seven of 12 experiments, but N was always the stronger limiting factor. P limitation was never observed to be the sole limiting nutrient. The results showed that a low concentration of P and a relatively high concentration of N do not necessarily indicate only P limitation in these lakes. Lake Cataouatche and Lake Salvador were dominated by centric diatoms, and Anabaena spp. were detected at high levels, particularly in summer. Lac des Allemands was generally dominated by N-fixing Anabaena spp. and other cyanobacteria, and their biomass responded significantly to N addition but not to P addition, indicating that nitrogen fixation in Lac des Allemands may be inhibited by other factors such as iron. Our bioassay results demonstrate that whether a water body is N- or P-limited is the consequence of the nutrient status and not the salinity regime. The results suggest that the addition of nutrient-rich waters via diversions of Mississippi River water into these lakes might increase the frequency of algal blooms, including noxious and toxic freshwater cyanobacteria.					; Turner, Robert/GQA-6087-2022	Rabalais, Nancy N./0000-0002-1514-837X; 													1559-2723	1559-2731				SEP	2009	32	5					958	974		10.1007/s12237-009-9174-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-009-9174-8													WOS:000268901500011

To gain a clearer understanding of the factors that affect river phytoplankton, the present study examined phytoplankton biomass and composition in relationship with physical and chemical parameters assessed in detail by preparing self-organising maps using functional groups and morpho-functional groups. Total nitrogen along with water residence time showed to be the best predictor to determine phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll a. Phytoplankton diversity increased with higher water discharge, but it had the consequence of diluting algae and decreasing biomass. Bacillariophyceae and Chlorophyceae species dominated the phytoplankton assemblages in all rivers. Diatoms predominated in rivers with shorter residence time. Dominant diatom codons of functional groups were C, D and TB while morpho-functional groups were represented by only diatom group VI. As residence time increased, the proportion of chlorococcalean green algae, represented by functional group codon T and morpho-functional group IV grew in summer. Since potamoplankton is dominated by diatoms, functional groups with its fine partition of diatom codons proved to be excellent descriptor of the potamoplankton. Application of morpho-functional groups originally developed from the lake data, showed to be limiting because of the predominating presence of only one diatom group.

Here we present the dating and environmental proxy results from a 35 m long core (A-WL10ZK-1) collected from the Ulan Buh Desert (UBD), along with supplemental data from four other cores. The UBD is one of the main desert dune fields in China and our results indicate the UBD has undergone complex evolution during the late Quaternary. Most of the present UBD was covered by a Jilantai-Hetao Mega-paleolake lasting until similar to 90 ka ago. A sandy desert environment prevailed throughout the UBD during the last glacial period and early Holocene. A wetland environment characterized by the formation of numerous interdunal ponds in the northern UBD occurred at similar to 8-7 ka, although a dune field persisted in the southern UBD. The modern UBD landscape formed after these wetlands dried up. During the last 2000 years, eolian sand from the Badain Jaran Desert has invaded the northern UBD, while farming and overgrazing resulted in the formation of the eastern UBD. We suggest that the formation of UBD landforms is related to the disintegration of the megalake Jilantai-Hetao and to summer monsoon changes during the last glaciation and Holocene.

A recycling of inorganic nutrients via phototrophic bacteria also appears to be relevant in other lakes with anoxic bottom waters.

To properly manage water resources and mitigate drought disasters, it is important to understand the long-term characteristics of drought and its possible link with large-scale climate indices. Based on the monthly meteorological data of 41 meteorological stations in Poyang Lake Basin from 1958 to 2017, the spatiotemporal variations of drought were investigated using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) methods and the modified Mann-Kendall (MMK) trend test were used to explore the spatiotemporal characteristics and trends of drought. Furthermore, to reveal possible links between drought variations and large-scale climate indices in Poyang Lake Basin, the relationships between SPEI and large-scale climate indices, such as North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Arctic Oscillation (AO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) were examined using cross-wavelet transform. The results showed that the SPEI in Poyang Lake Basin exhibited relatively stable quasi-periodic oscillation, with approximate quasi-3-year and quasi-6-year periods at the inter-annual scale and quasi-15-year and quasi-30-year periods at the inter-decadal scale from 1958 to 2017. Moreover, the Poyang Lake Basin experienced an insignificantly wetter trend as a whole at the annual and seasonal scales during the period of 1958-2017, except for spring, which had a drought trend. The special characteristics of the trend variations were markedly different in the basin. The areas in which drought was most likely to occur were mainly located in the Poyang Lake region, northwest and south of the basin, respectively. Furthermore, relationships between the drought and six climate indices showed that the drought exhibited a significant temporal correlation with five climate indices at restricted intervals, except for IOD. The dominant influences of the large-scale climate indices on the drought evolutions shifted in the Poyang Lake Basin during 1958-2017, from the NAO, Nino 3.4, and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) before the late 1960s and early 1970s, to the AO and PDO during the 1980s, then to the NAO, AO and SOI after the early 2000s. The NAO, AO and SOI exerted a significant influence on the drought events in the basin. The results of this study will benefit regional water resource management, agriculture production, and ecosystem protection in the Poyang Lake Basin.

In the years 2008-2009, analyses were carried out for seasonal changes in the quantity and composition of bacterioplankton in the lake examined, which is of high significance to the tourism and fishing industries and is located in the vicinity of an area subjected to reclamation after a pesticide dump. Bacterioplankton composition was assayed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation technique for the contribution of major groups of the Bacteria domain: Inot sign-, beta- and gamma-Proteobacteria, Cytophaga-Flavobacterium and Actinobacteria as well as bacteria capable of degrading pesticides in an aquatic environment-Pseudomonas spp. Seasonal patterns of the total number of bacteria were determined by direct counting of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-stained cells. The percentage of the detected Eubacteria (EUB 338 probe) relative to all the DAPI-stained bacteria in Lake SzelA...g Wielki ranged from 46% to 63%. Bacteria capable of degrading pesticides in an aquatic environment-Pseudomonas spp.-were identified with a highly specific probe PEA 998. The highest mean values of this parameter reached 5.1%. In the spring, Pseudomonas spp. bacteria accounted for up to 80% of all Gamma-Proteobacteria microbes. The study showed that the qualitative and quantitative changes in the bacterioplankton of the lake can be characterised by tendencies which are typical of a eutrophic water reservoir. However, a higher contribution of microorganisms capable of degrading sparingly degradable, toxic compounds and pesticides was determined in bacterioplankton from the PD-contaminated lake, as compared to microbial communities of a lake not contaminated with pesticides.

This study aims: (i) to assess the performance capabilities of a new and relatively more advantageous model, namely, Hydrological Predictions for the Environment (HYPE), that simulates stream flow and nutrient load in agricultural areas by using a multi-site and multi-objective parameter calibration method and (ii) to investigate the temporal and spatial variations of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorous (TP) concentrations and loads with crop rotation by using the model for the first time. A parameter estimation tool (PEST) was used to calibrate parameters. Results show that the parameters related to the effective soil porosity were highly sensitive to hydrological modeling. N balance was largely controlled by soil denitrification processes. P balance was influenced by the sedimentation rate and production/decay of P in rivers and lakes. The model reproduced the temporal and spatial variations of discharge and TN/TP relatively well in both calibration (2006-2008) and validation (2009-2010) periods. Among the obtained data, the lowest Nash-Suttclife efficiency of discharge, daily TN load, and daily TP load were 0.74, 0.51, and 0.54, respectively. The seasonal variations of daily TN concentrations in the entire simulation period were insufficient, indicated that crop rotation changed the timing and amount of N output. Monthly TN and TP simulation yields revealed that nutrient outputs were abundant in summer in terms of the corresponding discharge. The area-weighted TN and TP load annual yields in five years showed that nutrient loads were extremely high along Hong and Ru rivers, especially in agricultural lands.

We used the deep time domain electromagnetic (TDEM) geophysical system, Cycle-5M, which provides the maximum exploration capability, to depths similar to 1.5-2 km below land surface.

In deeper aquifers, brackish and saline groundwater bodies exist, which originated from lakes and lagoons that existed at the Dead Sea Rift valley during the Pleistocene and Pliocene, respectively. It was found that within carbonate formations, fresh groundwater (C < 10(3) ppm total dissolved solids (TDS)) is characterized by a resistivity of more than 15 Omega m, brackish groundwater (10(3)< C < 10(4) ppm TDS) is characterized by 5-15 Omega m, saline groundwater (10(4)< C < 10(5) ppm TDS) is characterized by 0.5-5 Omega m, and brine (10(5)< C ppm TDS) is characterized by less than 0.5 Omega m.																			0043-1397					DEC 4	2008	44	12							W12404	10.1029/2007WR006459	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007WR006459													WOS:000261478500001

Images were acquired before and during the surge, between November 1992 and October 1993. Terrain-corrected and co-registered imagery was used to measure the propagation of the surge front. Surface undulations interpreted to be evidence of accelerated flow, indicating surge initiation in late winter, were observed in the 26 March 1993 image. From 19 May to 25 August 1993, the mean propagation velocity of the surge front was 90 in d(-1). The surge reached the terminus shortly after 25 August 1993. The central area of the calving terminus then advanced into proglacial Vitus Lake at a mean rate of 19 in d(-1) between 9 August and 18 October 1993. Feature matching was used to measure discrete velocity vectors between 9 August and 13 September; the vectors were kriged onto a uniform grid and used to compute the principal strain rates.

Evaporation suppression from open water surface using various floating covers with consideration of water ecology	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												In arid and semi-arid regions, up to 50% of water reservoirs' capacity is lost by evaporation. Physical floating covers suppress evaporation mainly by intercepting solar radiation. Seasonal comparisons between different physical floating covers in dissimilar environments and their influences on water ecology have not been investigated. Two class-A pan experiments in outdoor settings have been conducted to investigate the influence of various floating covers that vary in color, shape, and coverage percentage (CP) on evaporation suppression efficiency (ESE), with considering water ecology by determining microalgae growth as a bio-indicator. The effect of white, black, and multicolor (mixture) balls, (91% CP) on evaporation rate (ER), ESE, surface water temperature (SWT), and microalgae growth was investigated for nine months, in two locations, i.e., Damanhour and E. Awinat, representing northern and southern Egypt, respectively. Additionally, the performance of white foam-sheet at CP of 91% (F-91%CP) and 100% (F-100%CP), plastic-sheet at CP of 91% (P-91%CP), and 100% (P-100% CP), and white balls (91%CP) were investigated for three weeks. Results showed that floating balls reduced ER (especially in summer months) in both locations with white balls having the greatest effect. In E. Awinat, the 9-month average saved-water depth was 5.17, 4.43, and 4.58 mm d(-1) for white, black, and multicolor balls, respectively. The corresponding values in Damanhour were 3.02, 2.63, and 2.73 mm d(-1). Using the floating covers, the ESE ranged from 27.0% (P-91%CP) to 96.0% (P-100%-CP and F-100%CP). The SWT of the covered water surface was significantly colder than the control in the morning and mid-day for all covers, except the plastic-sheet. However, by evening, the control was the coldest treatment. The full coverage of the water surface (P-100%CP and F-100%CP) reduced evaporation by 96.0%, but inhibited microalgae growth, while the partial coverage, i.e., white balls and F-91%CP, decreased evaporation by 62.18 and 60.6%, respectively, without detrimental effects on microalgae growth. In conclusion, when water ecology is not a concern, i.e., on-farm irrigation reservoir, then full coverage by plastic or foam sheets attains maximum ESE. However, in multipurpose reservoirs, ecological considerations are vital, therefore white-balls or F-91%CP are recommended. Further studies in real reservoirs are needed, besides investigating the durability and stability of the used covers.					; Abdallah, Ahmed/AAY-3305-2021; Shalaby, Maram/AAX-2834-2021	Abdallah, Ahmed/0000-0001-5633-9255; Shalaby, Maram/0000-0003-2020-2251													0022-1694	1879-2707				JUL	2021	598								126482	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126482	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126482		MAY 2021											WOS:000661813200197

In this paper, we present preliminary results of the application of this method to a drying evaporation pan, located in a Mediterranean wetland, during a two-month summer period. Results seem consistent with few atmospheric vapour data based on the assumption of isotopic equilibrium with precipitation, but we observed a shift between pan-derived A and the composition of vapour samples collected by cold trapping. These results suggest that further investigations are necessary to evaluate the effect of diurnal variations of atmospheric conditions on the applicability of the pan-evaporation method, and on the representative of grab atmospheric samples. We also propose a sensitivity analysis for evaluating the impact of the different measured components on A calculation, and show an improvement in the method efficiency as the pan is drying.					; Sonzogni, Corinne/AAG-5816-2019; Cartapanis, Olivier/AAM-9779-2021	Radakovitch, Olivier/0000-0003-2281-9298; Vallet-Coulomb, Christine/0000-0001-5898-1516; Cartapanis, olivier/0000-0001-8542-6884													1025-6016	1477-2639					2010	46	1					37	48	PII 918809173	10.1080/10256010903388238	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10256010903388238								20099185					WOS:000275532900004

In the OFAs peat mining water is purified conducting it across a natural mire of a given size. DOM plays an important role in the transport and reduction of organic matter, Fe and P in OFAs. The retention of Fe in filtrates, dissolved organic P and to some extent also DOM in the OFA under low flow conditions in summer is probably promoted by the high Fe content of the highest apparent molecular (HAMW) weight DOM in the peat mining water. On the other hand, the originally low Fe content of the DOM in the HAMW fraction may be one reason for the generally low reductions in these water quality parameters achieved during flood periods.																			0003-9136					OCT	1995	134	4					547	560																WOS:A1995TE86900009

These changes included reduced Ca2+ Concentrations, diminished depletion of DIC and alkalinity in the upper waters in the summer, and a shift to higher pH values. Results of analyses from sediment trap collections before and after closure of the facility indicate approximately 3-fold reductions in particulate inorganic carbon (PIC), and suspended solids deposition have occurred as a result of the closure. Despite these changes, the water column remains oversaturated with respect to the solubility of CaCO3. Moreover, there was no apparent relationship between the degree of CaCO3 saturation and PIC deposition. Changes in the extent of CaCO3 precipitation have altered the acid-base chemistry of the lake which, in turn, affects prevailing pollution problems associated with inputs of domestic waste, such as NH3 toxicity.

Long-term monitoring data on water quality from Sete Cidades and Furnas lakes (Sao Miguel island) were analyzed in order to address that the success of the ongoing policy reverses their eutrophic status. Sete Cidades lake (4.46 km(2)), made by two branches (so-called Green and Blue lakes), has a water volume equal to 58 x 10(6) m(3) and a depth in the range between 24 and 28.5 m. Furnas lake (1.87 km(2)) has a volume equal to 14 x 10(6) m(3) and a maximum depth of 15 m. In Sete Cidades lake mean water temperature and pH range respectively between 13.4 degrees C to 17.7 degrees C and 7.04 to 8.06. Instead, mean temperature in Lake Furnas ranges between 16.6 degrees C and 17.2 degrees C, with a pH between 7.36 and 7.84. Mean water conductivity shows that both lakes correspond to very diluted waters, with values between 98.1 and 136.5 mu S/cm. Water chemistry is influenced by the monomictic character of the lakes, as anoxic environment in the hypolimnion due to O-2 consumption during the summer, when stratification prevents mixing along the water column, explains sharp increase in TP, TN, N-ammoniacal, Mn and Fe. Major-ion content is rather constant along time, with some seasonal fluctuations, despite a decrease in SO4 observed in Sete Cidades lake which is suggested to be a result of runoff diversion, a result also shown by the decrease of the molal ratio TN/TP in both studied lakes. Nevertheless, the application of the trophic state index (TSITP) does not suggest an improvement in what concerns trophic status, which is explained by the internal P-loading, a source that have to be managed by environmental authorities in the near future in order to revert eutrophication.

Temporal changes and depth wise variations in pit pond hydrochemistry contaminated with industrial effluents with special emphasis on metal distribution in water-sediment system	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												The investigation showed pronounced temporal and vertical variations of pit lake-water chemistry contaminated with industrial effluents. An intermixing layer of few meters at a depth of 5-8 m usually separates an upper oxic epilimnion with alkaline pH from deeper sub-oxic/anoxic zone with relatively lower pH. Metal concentrations were in higher magnitude at anoxic zone in comparison to surface layer. Most of the parameters including metals showed higher concentrations during summer, while least concentrations were observed during monsoon. In shallow sediments, metals were mainly in insoluble-residual form, while redox metals were fractionated as oxihydroxide-reducible form. Geoaccumulation of metals in bottom sediments were Fe > Cr > Pb > Cu > Cd > Mn > Zn. Toxicity assessment showed that pit pond water is highly contaminated (C-d = 7.52) and moderate pollution load (PLI = 2.272) in shallow sediments, with metal evaluation index (HEI) value of 11.08 and 15.91 respectively.

In this study, we used seven chemical destaining reagents to treat samples of subfossil black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) trees from two lakes in the eastern Canadian boreal forest. We subsequently compared latewood BI (LBI) and delta BI (DBI) time series along with conventional maximum latewood density (MXD) measured from the stained and destained samples. Results showed that the stain of our samples is most likely caused by post-sampling oxidation of dissolved ferrous iron in lake sediments that penetrated into wood. Three reagents (ascorbic acid, sodium ascorbate, and sodium dithionite all mixed with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) could remove >90% of Fe. However, even for the best chemical protocol, a discrepancy of about +2 degrees C compared to MXD data remained in the LBI-based temperature reconstruction due to incomplete destaining. On the contrary, the simple mathematical delta correction, DBI, was unaffected by the Fe stain and showed very similar results compared to MXD data (r>0.82) from annual to centennial timescales over the past similar to 360 years. This study underlines the difficulty of completely destaining lake subfossil samples while confirming the robustness of the DBI approach. DBI data measured from stained LSTs can be used to perform robust millennial temperature reconstructions.

Here we present a 13,000-yr record from Sumxi Co (western Tibet), constructed from both lake-core and shoreline studies, which shows that conditions in the early-middle Holocene were warmer and wetter than at present. These results confirm model predictions of an intensified monsoon over the region at approximately 9,000 yr BP, owing to an orbitally induced increase in summer insolation 7,8. We also find evidence for warm, humid pulses at approximately 12,500 and approximately 10,000 yr BP, in phase with the steps of the last deglaciation, and for a. return to cold, dry conditions at approximately 11-10,000 yr BP, none of which can be explained by orbital variations.

Overall, there is little difference in the total area of drylands from the preindustrial period; global drylands are 8% wetter than during the preindustrial period as measured by an aridity index; and 16% of preindustrial drylands convert to a wetter climate subtype, double the sum of zones that are replaced by a drier category. Considerable variations are present among regions with major contractions of each dryland subtype from northern Africa to South Asia and the main expansions of arid, semiarid, and dry subhumid climates in southern hemisphere continents. The difference in precipitation is the leading factor of the aforementioned changes. The second factor is the altered potential evapotranspiration as mainly induced by relative humidity, which contributes to additional aridity changes in a same direction as precipitation does. The collective effects of precipitation and relative humidity account for more than 80% of the dryland variations. In comparison, the simulated aridity change is in reasonable agreement with reconstructions, while there are model-data discrepancies for Australia and uncertainties across proxies for southern Africa.

Shasta Dam has a temperature control device that enables managers to provide cold discharge temperatures to the river that are required for downstream Chinook salmon spawning and rearing. An added stress to water temperature management is prolonged drought and associated high air temperatures. California experienced its worst drought in a century from 2012 to 2015, and these conditions may provide insight into future reservoir conditions, as climate change predictions suggest that droughts will be more frequent and intense. In this study, a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model of Shasta Reservoir was used to simulate: (1) alternative reservoir operations during 2015 aimed at sustaining the volume of cold water in the reservoir to provide downstream cold water habitat during the critical time for endangered winter-run Chinook salmon egg incubation; and (2) reservoir temperature conditions under potential climate change scenarios. Results suggest that, with climate change, water managers at Shasta Reservoir may have increasing difficulty maintaining adequate cold pool volume in the reservoir through November, and even extreme reductions in reservoir outflows may not be enough to mitigate this result.

Light-trapping of larval and juvenile northern pike, Esox lucius, from Lake Davis, California Spring 2003	CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME												For the purpose of developing new management options for removal of young-of-the-year northern pike, Esox lucius, from Lake Davis, Plumes County, California, light-trapping was conducted using Plexiglas quatri-foil light-traps. Traps were deployed in a known pike spawning area to determine if emerging northern pike would respond photo-taxically and enter traps. Light-trapping efforts were spread over a 1-month developmental period. A total of 21 pike was caught using the light-traps in 7 total nights of trapping from 24 April 2003 to 24 May 2003. Light-trapped pike seemed to begin responding at a time frame of development just after yolk absorption ceased and predation was required. Light-trapped pike averaged 13.3 mm total length (TL). Traps used either battery-powered Kril (TM) ramps, or Cyalume photochemical lightsticks as attractants. Neither light source attracted a reasonable catch rate of pike to warrant this procedure in the Lake Davis management Plan.																			0008-1078					SUM	2006	92	3					149	155																WOS:000239144900004

Of a total of 102 samplings, the WHO limit for N in potable water (10.0 mg .cntdot. l-1) was exceeded by only 1 sample (23 mg .cntdot. l-1) from a pig farm. Most samples had nitrate levels in the range 0.1-5.0 mg .cntdot. l-1. An inverse relationship between nitrate concentration and distance from the shore of the lake was found for the northwestern section of the lake''s catchment. Levels of nitrate-N increased from 0.5 mg .cntdot. l-1 at 8.1-10.0 km from the lake''s shore to 2.0 mg .cntdot. l-1 at 0.1-2.0 km from the lake''s shore. Current farming practices around Lake Rotorua are contributing to the levels of nitrate in the local groundwater.

WATER LOSS BY EVAPORATION FROM PARTIALLY COVERED WATER BODIES	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MECHANICAL ENGINEERING CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION, 2011, VOL 1					ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition (IMECE)	NOV 11-17, 2011	Denver, CO	Amer Soc Mech Engn				Fresh water is a very precious commodity in most parts of the world; and much of it is held in lakes and reservoirs. Yet significant amount of this water is continuously lost due to evaporation, especially during hot seasons. One way to reduce this loss is to cover the water surface. However, due to its often large size, it is not practical to cover it totally. Furthermore, environmental considerations (like access to the water for water birds, not turning the water bodies into "hot soup", etc.) would render such attempt at total cover very undesirable. Instead, it is proposed here to partially cover these water bodies with floating covers which are of manageable size and easy to manufacture. They are supported by floats and leave an air gap (for environmental reasons) above the water surface. In this work, the covers are of hexagonal shape; and when used they together cover about 60% of the water surface area. Measurements have been conducted in situ of day-time evaporation levels from covered and uncovered water tanks, along with weather data (wind speed and direction, air temperature, solar radiation, and humidity) during a summer season (excluding rainy days) at a Sydney suburb. Results have shown that depending on the weather, reduction of evaporation in the range of 5 - 30% has been achieved with the covers. Results from this work also helps with understanding the evaporation process from lakes and reservoir, and the design of better covers.																					978-0-7918-5487-7				2012							591	596																WOS:000325040500065

This has resulted in corresponding improvements of the water quality in some acid sensitive small lakes of southern Finland. Among the fish of these lakes, the first signs of recovery were recorded in the early 1990s, when the European perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) started to reproduce in some sparse populations. Since then, the reproduction of perch has been successful in several years. The appearance of strong year-classes in lakes earlier almost empty of fish indicates recovery. This development has resulted in increased population densities, decreased mean sizes of fish and decreased growth rates. In a more acid sensitive species, roach (Rutilus rutilus (L.)), no clear indications of recovery have been recorded this far. However, schools of small roach (age 1+) were observed in the summer of 1998 in two acidic lakes that were inhabited by sparse roach populations during 1985-1995.																			0049-6979					AUG-SEP	2001	130	1-4	3				1373	1378		10.1023/A:1013919720914	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1013919720914													WOS:000172012000077

Since that initial observation similar events have been noted in Lakes Michigan, Erie and Ontario with imagery from LANDSAT, SKYLAB and NOAA satellites. By the use of LANDSAT multispectral data together with NOAA thermal IR data, it was observed that whiting occurs several meters below the lake surface in relatively warm water. It is most vividly displayed during and after periods of upwelling. As the epilimnetic waters become supersaturated with Ca2+ ions during summer, a triggering mechanism (presumably biological or physical) initiates the whiting, which may continue for several months. At present, the effects on the biota of the euphotic zone when this milky cloud is present in the upper layers are poorly understood.

Behavioral thermoregulation by adult Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in estuary and freshwater habitats prior to spawning	FISHERY BULLETIN												The movements of maturing Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) from marine waters into rivers pose challenges for their physiology, especially in basins affected by human structures and increasing temperatures. This study determined the thermal regimes experienced by maturing Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) entering the Lake Washington basin in western Washington through navigational locks and a ship canal and migrating through the lake to spawning grounds. Chinook salmon entered in mid-summer, when temperatures were warmest, but often moved back into the cool, marine waters of Puget Sound before travelling quickly through the ship canal and into Lake Washington. In Lake Washington, they swam above and below the thermocline and made little use of the available thermal refuge in deep water before ascending rivers to spawn. The migration timing and tactics of Chinook salmon indicate a greater tolerance for warm water than that of sympatric sockeye salmon (O. nerka, documented in an independent study), but in each species the ability to exploit thermal refuges may be essential for their survival in the face of the increasing temperatures seen in this basin in the past decades and those that are likely to continue rising in the future.																			0090-0656	1937-4518					2019	117	3					258	271		10.7755/FB.117.3.12	http://dx.doi.org/10.7755/FB.117.3.12													WOS:000486313200012

Here we evaluate the impacts of wildfire smoke on phosphorus (P) biogeochemical cycling in a temperate watershed in the Finger Lakes Region of Central New York located downwind from record setting Canadian forest fires during the summer of 2023. Daily sampling of stream and rainwaters was conducted over the 2 month smoke period, generating a robust geochemical dataset. Stream dissolved P showed high sensitivity to smoke events, attaining concentrations 2-3 x greater than the pre-smoke period. Subsequent rain events after smoke deposition were identified as a potentially important factor in magnitude and timing of dissolved P responses. These findings demonstrate the capacity for wildfire smoke to trigger rapid, observable changes to stream P chemistry. Smoke transported from the record setting Canadian wildfires in 2023 triggered two- to threefold increases in dissolved phosphorus levels in streams in the Fingers Lake region, New York, according to daily measurements in an actively monitored watershed.					; fernandez, nicole/JOK-5120-2023	Jamison, Hunter/0000-0003-3608-3605; Gold, Zoe/0009-0009-8033-0344; Fernandez, Nicole/0000-0003-0052-4042														2662-4435				OCT 4	2024	5	1							562	10.1038/s43247-024-01732-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s43247-024-01732-w													WOS:001326052700002

The hypothesis that local climatic temperature affects the wintering behavior of Greater Flamingos was tested. Data were collected for a period of 3days in March and 10days in April using focal animal analysis. Each day was divided into four periods (7-8 a.m., 10-11 a.m., 1-2 p.m., and 4-5 p.m.). Activity patterns included characters like feeding, resting, flying, walking, preening, aggression, and alert. Results showed that feeding was the major activity for adults (51.06%) and juveniles (56.51%). Juveniles spent more time (t=-2.02, p<0.05) feeding than adults. There was a highly significant difference (t=3.20, p<0.01) in alert between adults and juveniles across time periods. Adults spent more time alert (8.3%) than juveniles (4.49%). Only aggression and alert in adults and walking and alert in juveniles was found significantly correlated to change with temperature. The findings of the present study highlighted the need of in-depth eco-ethological study of Greater Flamingo and hydrology of wetland.

These oligomictic lakes are experiencing a decrease in the frequency of winter full turnover and an intensification of stability. As a result, hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations are decreasing and nutrients are accumulating in bottom water, with effects on the whole ecosystem functioning. Forecasting the future evolution of the mixing pattern is relevant to assess if a reduction in GHG releases would be able to revert such processes. The study focuses on Lake Maggiore, for which the thermal structure evolution under climate change in the 2016-2085 period was assessed through numerical simulations, performed with the General Lake Model (GLM). Different prospects of regional air temperature rise were considered, given by the Swiss Climate Change Scenarios CH2011. Multiple realisations were performed for each scenario to obtain robust statistical predictions, adopting random series of meteorological data produced with the Vector-Autoregressive Weather Generator (VG). Results show that a reversion in the increasing thermal stability would be possible only if global GHG emissions started to be reduced by similar to 2020, allowing an equilibrium mixing regime to be restored by the end of the twenty-first century. Otherwise, persistent lack of complete-mixing, severe water warming and extensive effects on water quality are to be expected for the centuries to come. These projections can be extended to the other lakes in the subalpine district.					; ROGORA, MICHELA/B-9237-2008; ROGORA, MICHELA/IZD-8951-2023; Sibilla, Stefano/AAI-9155-2020; Dresti, Claudia/ITT-6857-2023; Fenocchi, Andrea/ITT-9012-2023; Ciampittiello, Marzia/AAY-1694-2020	SIBILLA, STEFANO/0000-0002-5541-6949; ROGORA, MICHELA/0000-0003-3515-0220; Fenocchi, Andrea/0000-0001-6898-6433; Dresti, Claudia/0000-0002-0666-1278; Ciampittiello, Marzia/0000-0001-6403-0493; 													0930-7575	1432-0894				NOV	2018	51	9-10					3521	3536		10.1007/s00382-018-4094-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-018-4094-6													WOS:000447366100020

NO3- was usually the most abundant (0.2-19.3 .mu.g-atoms N .cntdot. l-1), NH4+ occasionally reached similar concentrations (< 0.05-16.4 .mu.g-atoms N .cntdot. l-1), and urea-N was always present in low concentrations (< 0.5-1.5 .mu.g-atoms N .cntdot. l-1). NO3- dominated the total nitrogenous nutrient pool during spring (> 90% .SIGMA.N as NO3-) when Peridinium cinctum was dominant, but at all times phytoplankton showed preferential NH4+ uptake. The Peridinium bloom periods were characterized by the highest specific uptake and transport rates for NH4+. Turnover times throughout the study ranged from 21-> 7000 h for NO3-, 1-630 h for NH4+, and 5-> 560 h for urea-N. Patterns of preferential utilization for NO3-, NH4+, and urea-N were similar to those reported for Chesapeake Bay [USA] plankton. Midday uptake rates for NO3-, NH4+ and urea-N were all higher under natural light than in darkness.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1982	27	4					673	680		10.4319/lo.1982.27.4.0673	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1982.27.4.0673													WOS:A1982NY08300007

Humic acids (HAs) actively interact with organic and inorganic components of lake sediments. This interaction depends on the molecular structure and elemental composition of HAs. The presented research focuses on the investigation of the composition and molecular structure of humic acids isolated from lakes located in the Lena Delta in the Russian Arctic. The findings of the research are needed to estimate the potential capacity of humic acids to bind microelements, particularly toxic metals, in stable compounds. Surface sediment samples (0-10 cm) were collected from 8 lakes by Van Veen grab during the summer period of the "Expedition LENA 2019". We analyzed elemental composition of the HAs samples. The results showed that the studied HAs of lake sediments are characterized by low nitrogen content and prevalence of aliphatic fragments in their molecular structure. Furthermore, it was found that the studied humic acids are less mature, showing mineralization processes dominant over humification, and have relatively low potential to complexation compared with soils of the Lena Delta as well as lake sediments of territories with more boreal climate conditions.					; Fedorova, Irina/N-3436-2013; Guzeva, Alina/ABG-2528-2020	Guzeva, Alina/0000-0002-9501-1698; 													0138-0338	2081-8262					2021	42	3					173	191		10.24425/ppr.2021.137142	http://dx.doi.org/10.24425/ppr.2021.137142													WOS:000692870100002

Modern halolites (halite oolites) in the Tuz Golu, Turkey	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Halite oolites (halolites) and pisoids (halopisoids) precipitate yearly (in summer) in the brine conduits of the saltpans in the Tuz Golu saline lake (Central Anatolia, Turkey). These hatolites are well rounded and spherical, ranging between 0.7 and 2 cm in size. They are composed of coarse-grained halite crystals as the nucleus, and by concentric halite laminae with a radial fabric as the cortex. The cortex is subdivided into inner, middle, and outer zones, each zone showing different mineralogical and morphological features. These features include the presence of. organic matter particles, native sulphur globules, gypsum-anhydrite-calcite laminae, quartz-chlorite-celestite-then-nonatrite laminae, submicroscopic halite crystals, and microborings, cavities and corrosion-like structures. Our observations in the Tuz Golu saltpan environment and in the halolite fabrics suggest that (1) an intermittent supply of heavy brines from the saline lake into the saltpan conduits, which occur under agitated conditions during pumping operations, is the main genetic reason for the halolite formation: and that (2) physical, chemical and biological factors exert a significant influence on the mineralogical-textural complexity of the cortex.

The results showed that jumpers' steady flight position was almost completed within 0.5 s. The most significant correlation with the length of the jump was found in the angle between the skis and body (r =.714, p <= .001 at 1.1 s after the take-off). This particular phase seemed to be important because the ski angle of attack was also related to the jumping distance at the same phase. Although the more upright ski position relative to flight path resulted in longer jumping distance, the winner of the competition had significantly lower ski position as compared to the other good jumpers. This may be due to the high altitude (> 2000 m) of the ski jumping stadium in this competition. Because of the low air density, the aerodynamic forces were also low and this probably caused less skilful jumpers to lean too much forward at this phase. Maintenance of speed seemed to be emphasized in this particular competition. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

G.; Shcherba, A., V			Features of the Interannual and Seasonal Dynamics of the Ecological State of Salt Lakes under the Arid Climate of Crimea	ARID ECOSYSTEMS												Unique lakes of various genesis are found on the Crimean Peninsula, which have a high recreational and balneological potential. They are under a significant anthropogenic load, which, along with the arid climate, leads to negative consequences for the ecosystems and even to the loss of biological and hydro-mineral resources. More than this, the closely located water bodies can differ significantly due to differences in human activities. Lake Moinaki on the western outskirts of Yevpatoria is divided by a sand barrier into two reservoirs, Moinaki-1 (larger) and Moinaki-2 (smaller). The aim of this work was to study some physicochemical parameters of water (temperature, pH, oxygen content, salinity, and redox potential, Eh) and Artemia population (Artemia salina (L, 1758)) in these water bodies in 2018-2020. The seasonal dynamics of the studied parameters has been characterized by an increase in salinity and Eh in summer resulted from an increase in air and water temperature and its intense evaporation. Simultaneously, a decrease in oxygen content and as well as in pH levels has been observed. The identified features were more pronounced in Moinaki-2 than in Moinaki-1. Artemia cysts were found in both reservoirs, while nauplii and adults were found only in Moinaki-2 in 2020, after drying and subsequent restoration of the hydrological regime of the water body.

It is surrounded by local agricultural activities and one seasonal river is terminated to it. Due to recent years the aquatic life of Zarivar Lake was under serious threat. Water quality study is one of the substantial measures that could be carried out since water quantity has been subjected to drought and low precipitation. Field study was planned in structured regular sampling stations in two straight routes and 24 samples in aggregation. Hypoxia potential investigation in closed shallow water body via current standards was done. Results of analysis demonstrate the potential of hypoxia in closed shallow water body. Significant effects of geological characteristics in hypoxia potential in figure out due to matrix analysis. Comparison of the results with the long-term data on water quality led the conclusion toward a suggestion on the effects of water catchments' activities during land use and land cover (LU/LC) changes over the years. Sources of nutrients associated biological parameters and macro indicators like submerged plants continue to verify and strengthen the relationship between the nitrogen loads of the LU/LC changes. The additional findings support the new hypoxia potential indicator in Zarivar Lake.					; Darban, Ahmad/JJE-4111-2023	partani, sadegh/0000-0002-5712-371X; 															978-0-7844-8059-5				2017							511	518																WOS:000405216400047

The direct and most noticeable result of karstification is a special morphology that makes karst regions quite different from any other non-karstic region. One of the most representative geomorphic forms characteristic of karst regions is the sinkhole. The aim of this paper is to present the background information and the results of a study of sinkholes in the Dasht-e Arzhan polje, southwestern Iran, which is tectonically controlled. In order to understand the mechanism of sinkhole formation and the relationship to adjacent springs and lake water down-gradient, a comprehensive tectonic and hydrogeologic study was conducted along with geochemical analysis and salt tracer studies. Sinkholes are important points of recharge/discharge in karst aquifers. The establishment of the National Karst Research Center demonstrates that the recognition of sinkholes and karst phenomenon is vital knowledge in the analysis of geologic hazards related to the collapse of dams and other civil engineering problems in Iran.																					90-5410-867-3				1997							509	514																WOS:A1997BH94W00066

Sedimentation rates based on Pb-210 activity profiles are far too low, mainly due to the deposition of 'aged' sediment, i.e, sediment eroded elsewhere inside the basin and not fully enriched with Pb-210 at th, moment of deposition. Also, specific adsorption to the finest sediment components, mixing, winnowing, and mobilization of the caesium have affected the lead and caesium profiles. Field experiments on mussel plots showed that mussels deposit 5-10 cm of fine-grained sediment during the summer. This biodeposition about equals the settling from flocculation in the water column. Micro-fabric microscope studies revealed that pellets do not dominate the sediments, indicating that some of the pellets are broken down or resuspended.																			0272-7714					FEB	1995	40	2					195	217		10.1016/S0272-7714(05)80005-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0272-7714(05)80005-8													WOS:A1995QK54400005

Wide variation in counts was observed in both types of barracks on different days. At the end of the study, open plates were found to be a poor method of air sampling because stray irradiation at 5-ft. level induced at 19% reduction in counts.

First, in 2003-2004, we trapped for H. cyanoguttatus in Lake Pontchartrain (an oligohaline estuary) to determine if this freshwater species occurred in estuarine habitats. Our goal was to test the prediction that H. cyanoguttatus used estuarine corridors to disperse. Second, we sampled and compared 16 GNOMA sites before and after the 2005 hurricanes to determine how H. cyanoguttatus populations responded. Finally, we monitored H. cyanoguttatus populations monthly over two years (2006-2007) at six sites within the GNOMA to determine if numbers continued to increase after the hurricanes. We confirmed that H. cyanoguttatus: 1) does occur in estuarine habitats (0 to 8 psu), 2) effectively survived the 2005 hurricanes, 3) has increased significantly from 2006 to 2007 at three of six GNOMA sites, 4) is currently found more often in urban sites, and 5) persisted through the atypically cold winter of 2009/2010.																			1528-7092	1938-5412				DEC	2011	10	4					673	686		10.1656/058.010.0407	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/058.010.0407													WOS:000306607500007

Dry steppe dominated the lake basin from ca. 11,000 to 8000 cal yr BP, suggesting a warm and dry climate. Grasses and birch forests expanded 8000 to 6400 cal yr BP, implying a remarkable increase in the monsoon precipitation. From 6400 to 4400 cal yr BP, the climate became cooler and drier. Chenopodiaceae dominated the interval from 4400 to 3350 cal yr BP, marking extremely dry condition. Artemisia recovered 3350-2050 cal yr BP, denoting an amelioration of climatic conditions. Both temperature and precipitation decreased 2050 to 1000 cal yr BP as indicated by decreased Artemisia and the development of pine forests. During the last 1000 yr, human activities might have had a significant influence on the environment of the lake region. We suggest that the East Asian summer monsoon did not become intensified until 8000 cal yr BP due to the existence of remnant ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere. Changes in the monsoon precipitation on millennial to centennial scales would be related to ocean-atmosphere interactions in the tropical Pacific. (C) 2009 University of Washington.

In this study, the musty odor and its main causative compounds in the Huangpu River source water were confirmed through a yearly investigation using flavor profile analysis combined with HSPME-GC-MS analysis. The investigation showed that 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) with a concentration level between 28.6 and 71.0 ng/L was responsible for the musty odor in summer from July to September. Microscopic observation confirmed with the cloning results showed that Phormidium spp., which accounted for 80%-95% of the algal cell density, was the microorganisms responsible for the production of 2-MIB and the estimated 2-MIB yield was 0.022 pg/cell. Results from a wide-area sampling campaign in the Huangpu River watershed showed that, other than the large tributaries receiving water from Tai Lake, several small creeks close to the intake may have contributed most of the 2-MIB and the Phormidium spp. to the Huangpu River source water. This study provides methodology for the investigation of odor causing compounds and microorganisms in river-type source water, and the result will be useful for water quality control in both source water and drinking water.

The results of the study showed that P in the sediments mainly consisted of inorganic phosphorus (IP) and that IP mainly consisted of non-apatite phosphorus (NAIP). The horizontal and temporal distributions of the P fractions were different from each other, but the vertical distribution was similar, which indicated a trend of stabilization after falling. The content of total phosphorus (TP), IP, organic phosphorus (OP), NAIP, apatite phosphorus (AP), and bio-available phosphorus (BAP) in the sediments during the three seasons ranged from 193.85 to 1664.05 mg.kg(-1), 126.90 to 1127.70 mg.kg(-1), 43.74 to 669.29 mg.kg(-1), 57.62 to 937.07 mg.kg(-1), 32.58 to 250.71 mg.kg(-1), and 41.06 to 871.82 mg.kg(-1), respectively. NAIP contents in the sediments accounted for more than 50% of TP. Using an analysis from three aspects, the eutrophication risk index (ERI) could be used to assess the potential release of P in the sediments, and there was a high release risk of P in the sediments in the Shanmei reservoir.					wang, ruoshi/OLQ-6008-2025														0954-2299	2047-6523				OCT 19	2017	29	1					170	178		10.1080/09542299.2017.1392261	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09542299.2017.1392261													WOS:000423054600001

The importance of surrogate habitats in lowland river floodplains for fish community composition	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												P>Floodplain borrow pits created during dike construction for flood protection along regulated lowland rivers are suggested as convenient surrogate habitats for fish communities where natural floodplain features have been lost. Fish community structure and reproduction success in three borrow pits located in the channelised floodplain of the River Dyje, Czech Republic were studied over 3 years. Short-term floods supported the spawning of phytophilic and phyto-lithophilic species; batch spawners capitalised on late summer flood conditions. The highest species richness of 0+ juvenile fishes occurred at sites with extended periods of flooding, at least for 2 months. Flooded vegetation was inhabited mainly by juvenile cyprinids, while 0+ percids were distributed evenly along the littoral zone. Shoreline remained bare even during higher water levels before complete inundation because of the steep banks, and therefore fish were not able to benefit from higher water levels. Borrow pits appear to function as a substitute habitat for fish and their reproduction, but only if they are properly constructed with shallow areas providing appropriate nursing conditions for 0+ fish growth and survival.					; ONDRACKOVA, Marketa/G-1479-2014; Jurajda, Pavel/F-9647-2014; Ondrackova, Marketa/G-1479-2014	Jurajda, Pavel/0000-0002-4651-0415; ONDRACKOVA, Marketa/0000-0003-0933-806X; 													0969-997X	1365-2400				DEC	2009	16	6					468	477		10.1111/j.1365-2400.2009.00698.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2400.2009.00698.x													WOS:000271781800005

We fertilized a naturally oligotrophic lake (Lake 303) in the Experimental Lakes Area, northwestern Ontario [Canada], with nitrogen and phosphorus over two summers and examined the subsequent recovery using mass balance and large in situ mesocosms. While large amounts of ammonium and smaller amounts of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) were released from the lake''s aerobic sediments during the first year of recovery, phosphorus input from the sediments was not detectable during the same period. Chlorophyll a concentration closely tracked total phosphorus concentration, and both returned to prefertilization levels within 1 yr. In contrast, ammonium, nitrate, DIC, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) needed almost 2 yr to reach baseline levels, and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) even longer. The results show that different elements may recover at different rates and that the release of stored pools of nitrogen and carbon in the sediments plays a major role in delaying the recovery of these elements.

The study found that 1) Wuhan City rainstorm waterlogging occurred during the summer months, mostly in June and July, accounting for 90% of the total waterlogging; 2) Waterlogging generally occurred along the rivers and lakes near low-lying areas; 3) The longest continuous waterlogging time was greater than 10 h and the deepest water depth was 2 m; 4) The greater the cumulative rainfall over 24 h, 12 h, 6 h, or 3 h, the more severe the waterlogging was; 5) The thresholds of continuous 24 h rainfall of mild, moderate, and severe waterlogging in Wuhan City were 123, 163, and 196 mm, respectively, while 12 h cumulative rainfall thresholds were 86, 145, and 187 mm, respectively. The 6 h cumulative rainfall thresholds were 68, 113, and 135 mm, respectively, and 3 h cumulative rainfall thresholds were 40, 74, and 94 mm, respectively. If the city's drainage capacity increases, the cumulative rainfall of waterlogging warning indicators will also need to be adjusted.																			1755-1307						2017	82								012048	10.1088/1755-1315/82/1/012048	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/82/1/012048													WOS:000439411400048

Phosphorus concentrations in a Florida Everglades water conservation area before and after El Nino events in the dry season	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The Florida Everglades depends on both seasonal hydroperiods and low nutrient loading. This study investigated phosphorus concentrations in a 237,000-ha wetland complex in the Greater Florida Everglades known as Water Conservation Area 3A (WCA-3A). WCA-3A is south and downstream of Lake Okeechobee and most of the agricultural activity in the Everglades region, but immediately north and upstream of the Everglades National Park. The original goal of the study was to investigate if this water conservation area was serving as a phosphorus sink during a 9-month period (October 2015 to June 2016) that normally would have bracketed the dry winter season of south Florida. The beginning of 2016 brought several unexpected polar fronts with high rainfall, an unusual weather pattern in subtropical Florida later confirmed to have been caused by an El Nino condition in the Pacific Ocean. Samples taken at the beginning of the dry season (October through December 2015 during pre-El Nino conditions) showed low phosphorus concentrations. In April and June 2016 during post-El Nino conditions, monthly average total phosphorus concentrations averaged 7.1-7.2 ppb total phosphorus in inflow region of WCA-3A, significantly higher (P = 0.030 and 0.045) than 3.0 and to 2.6 ppb in the wetland's outflow region. The wetland was found to be a sink of phosphorus with a 47% decrease in total phosphorus from north to south during this post- El Nino time. If future additional wetlands and water quality strategies are not in place to mitigate fluxes of phosphorus during future climate variations such as this El Nino condition, this wetland complex may take on an even greater role of protecting the water quality of the downstream Everglades National Park.

J	Kovats, ZE; Ciborowski, JJH; Corkum, LD				Kovats, ZE; Ciborowski, JJH; Corkum, LD			Inland dispersal of adult aquatic insects	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Adult caddisflies (Trichoptera) and mayflies (Ephemeroptera) were light-trapped on summer evenings along the Detroit River and Lake St. Clair, near Windsor, Ontario, Canada. Light traps were located at the shore and at increasing distances inland up to 5 km, and were operated simultaneously for 2 h following sunset. Catches of five species of caddisflies of the family Hydropsychidae (Cheumatopsyche campyla, Cheumatopsyche speciosa, Hydropsyche hageni, Hydropsyche phalerata, Macrostemum zebratum) and the mayfly Hexagenia (Ephemeridae) were used to examine inland distribution. 2. Inland dispersal was limited: catches of caddisflies declined at a greater than exponential rate with increasing distance from shore. Mean dispersal distance from the shoreline ranged from 650 to 1845 m. Smaller caddisfly species dispersed shorter distances than larger caddisflies and Hexagenia. 3. Inland distribution of adult caddisflies exhibited considerable interspecific variation: distribution was inconsistent among trials for Hexagenia, possibly owing to timing of collections in relation to periods of: peak emergence. 4. Sex ratios of caddisflies were female biased at most sites. No consistent bias was observed for Hexagenia. Different inland distribution patterns were observed for males and females. The differences appeared to reflect species-specific reproductive strategies.

This diversity is manifested, among others, by the occurrence of geosites of special cognitive, educational, and tourist value. This article aimed to list out such sites and their expert assessment using point valuation and triangulation methods. The authors described and assessed a total of 44 geosites, which were rock outcrops, including travertine outcrops, fragments of river valleys, lakes, caves, waterfalls, mineral water springs, peat bogs, landslides, viewpoints, and others. Of all the assessed geosites, the best values of the final valuation coefficient were obtained by the Oravske hradn & eacute; bralo outcrop, the Dreven & iacute;k outcrop, the Strednica viewpoint, and the Spissky hradny vrch outcrop. The authors believe that the promotion of geotourism and geosites in the Sub-Tatra region can contribute to greater dispersion of tourists and minimise the phenomenon of overtourism in the High Tatra Mts.

These sediments proved to be valuable proxies of climatic changes and their origin is discussed. The influences of grain size, organic matter absorption and Fe-Mn oxides on REE composition were determined to not be significant. The dominant source of sediments was ascertained to be the weathered granite residues from the catchment, enriched in light rare earth elements (LREE). Intensified East Asian summer monsoon(EASM) resulted in intensive chemical weathering, leading to enhanced REE and LREE fractionations in the weathered residues; this caused the increase in REE and LREE, and decrease in heavy rare earth element(HREE) fractionation degrees in the sediment. Therefore, our results indicate that changes in LREE/HREE, (La/Yb)N, (La/Sm)N) and (Gd/Yb)N, the proxies of REE, LREE, and HREE fractionations, can serve as proxies of regional climate-induced chemical weathering and thus serve to constrain EASM changes.

However, these sports resources haven't been reasonably explored and utilized. There still exist such main problems as the insufficient excavation, the superficial exploration, the non-prominent exploration, the insufficient integration of resources and the shortage of compound talents in sports tourism. Based on the survey of the types and features, the current situation and the present problems of exploration on sports tourism resources in South Sichuan, this thesis proposes that the excavation and planning of sports tourism should be enhanced, the features should be prominent to build Boutique, the regional cooperation should be reinforced to integrate advantages, and the compound talents in sports tourism should be quickly trained to further explore the sports tourism resources.																			1867-5662		978-3-642-25537-3				2011	119						241	248																WOS:000303072600035

Sorption-Diffusion Model of 137Cs Uptake by a Water Body Bottom in Estimations of Water Contamination	RADIOCHEMISTRY												For a sample including 22 lakes, the Cs-137 concentrations in water were determined by the sorption-diffusion model. The 137Cs levels in waters of lakes of the Kola Peninsula and Karelian Isthmus are satisfactorily described by the suggested model at the distribution coefficient K-d of 4000 L kg(-1) and diffusion coefficient D of 1.0 x 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1) for 2-4-year exposure. For mid-latitude lakes, the ranges of K-d and D of Cs-137 were 6000-1200 L kg(-1) and 1.0 x 10(-7)-0.2 x 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1), respectively. The Cs-137 concentration in water is determined by the major contribution of silts, which are characterized by high K-d of Cs-137 and by large thickness of sediments on the bottom of lake hollows, to the watter-bottom sorption system. After 2-year exposure of "Chernobyl" Cs-137 in lakes, its inventory in water relative to the amount that fell out in 1986 did not exceed 14% for deep lakes and 2-3.6% for shallow lakes.

J	Karlsson, H; Emanuelsson, M; Segerström, U				Karlsson, Hanna; Emanuelsson, Marie; Segerstrom, Ulf			The history of a farm-shieling system in the central Swedish forest region	VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY												The local vegetation history of three sites in the forested region of central Sweden was studied. These sites were the forest village site A"ngersjo and the two nearby shieling sites, Gammelvallen and A-jingsvallen. The aim of the study was to elucidate the relationship between the establishment of the farm and of the shielings. The results indicate that agriculture began in the area in the Roman Iron Age or Migration period. There is evidence of contemporaneous human activity in the village of A"ngersjo and the shieling at A-jingsvallen, suggesting the development of a farm-shieling system. We suggest that permanent farms and shielings were established concurrently as a local system, and that one of the main reasons was to demonstrate that the territory between the farm and the shieling was a potential resource area belonging to the farm. The problems of using pollen to differentiate between a shieling and a farm are also evaluated and it is concluded that multiple sites as well as a multidisciplinary approach is essential in order to be able to address such complex problems as the emergence of the farm-shieling system.																			0939-6314	1617-6278				MAR	2010	19	2					103	119		10.1007/s00334-009-0231-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-009-0231-9													WOS:000274044800003

Impacts of manure management practices on stream microbial loading into Conesus Lake, NY	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The microbiology of stream water has a seasonal component that results from both biogeochemical and anthropogenic processes. Analysis of nonevent conditions in streams entering Conesus Lake, NY (USA), indicated that total coliform, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus spp. levels peak in the summer in all streams, independent of the agricultural use in the stream sub-watershed. Prior to implementation of management practices, E coli in water draining Graywood Gully, a sub-watershed with 74% of the land in agriculture, reached as high as 2806 CFU/100 mL, exceeding the 235 CFU/100 mL EPA Designated Bathing Beach Standard (EPA-DBBS). In contrast, North McMillan Creek, a sub-watershed with <13% of its land in had E. coli maxima generally near or below the EPA-DBBS. Graywood Gully at times had a higher agriculture, microbial loading than North McMillan Creek, a sub-watershed 48 times larger in surface area. Over a 5-year study period, there was a major decrease in bacterial loading during nonevent conditions at Graywood Gully, especially after manure management practices were implemented, while bacterial loading was constant or increased in streams draining three other sub-watersheds. E. coli levels dropped more than 10 fold to levels well below the EPA-DBBS while the yearly maximum for Enterococcus dropped by a factor 2.5. Similarly, exceedency curves for both E. coli and Enterococcus also showed improvement since there were fewer days during which minimum standards were exceeded. Even so, Graywood Gully at times continued to be a major contributor of E. coli to Conesus Lake. if wildlife represents a significant source of indicator bacteria to Graywood Gully as has been reported, stream remediation, management efforts and compliance criteria will need to be adjusted accordingly.

Combined with the day-to-day human activities the climatic changes heavily affect the environment. In particular, a global temperature increase accompanied by a number of anthropogenic chemicals falling within the freshwater ecosystem results in a dramatic enhancement of the overall stress for most aquatic organisms. This leads to a significant shift in the species inventory and potential breakdown of the water ecosystem with severe consequences for local economies and water supply. In order to understand and predict the influence of climatic changes on the physiological and biochemical processes that take place in living aquatic organisms we explore the application of optical spectroscopy for monitoring and quantitative assessment of antioxidant enzymes activity in benthic amphipods of Lake Baikal. We demonstrate that the changes of the enzymes activity in Baikal amphipods undergoing thermal and/or hypoxia stress can be observed and documented by UV and optical spectroscopy both in vivo and in vitro.

J	Pakzad, HR; Fayazi, F				Pakzad, Hamid R.; Fayazi, Farajollah			Sedimentology and stratigraphic sequence of the Gavkhoni playa lake, SE Esfahan, Iran	CARBONATES AND EVAPORITES												The Gavkhoni playa lake is surrounded by alluvial fan deposits to the north, south and east and the Varzaneh aeolian sand field to the west. Four major sub-environments including: sand flat/saline sand flat, sand beach, mud flat/saline mud flat and salt pan and seven major facies can be recognized in this playa lake. Sand flat results from transportation of sand by wind from the adjacent sand dunes. The mud flat reflects rapid deposition on a lower flood plain during wet, shortly after sheet floods. The saline mud flat and salt pan is as a result of three stages: flooding, evaporation and desiccation. After flooding, when the shallow ephemeral take becomes concentrated by evaporation, saline mud flat is formed and finally the formation of salt pan starts. Regarding the sub-environments it is supposed that climatic changes played an important role in sedimentation. During periods of increased run off, sedimentation of alluvial/fluvial occurred and water table was raised at the playa lake. During periods of reduced run-off and falling water table, the saline mud flat and salt pan were formed and wind erosion of alluvial deposits resulted in formation of sand dune and sand flat.

Furthermore, we identified several APPs, including water temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, pH, phosphate, total phosphorus, trophic level index (TLI), nitrate, ammonia nitrogen, and total nitrogen, that significantly influenced PEC structures. Specifically, we found that Stephanodiscus hantzschii, Simocephalus serrulatus, Cryptomonas sp.

We apply a Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) model to constrain the uncertainties associated with sediment fingerprinting of atmospheric dust in the Sistan region on the Iran-Afghanistan border, one of the world's dustiest places. 57 dust samples were collected from the rooftop of the Zabol Department of Environmental Protection during a summer dusty period from June to October 2014, in addition to 31 surface soil samples collected from potential sources nearby, including cultivated land (n = 8), uncultivated rangeland (n = 7), and two dry lakes: Hamoun Puzak (n = 10) and Hamoun Saberi (n = 6). Dust and soil samples were analyzed for 24 tracers including 16 geochemical elements and 8 water-soluble ions, Five optimum composite fingerprints (Fe, Sr, Mn, Cr and Pb) were selected for discriminating sources by a two-stage statistical process involving a Kruskal-Wallis test and stepwise discriminant function analysis (DFA). Uncertainty ranges for source contributions of dust determined by the GLUE model showed that the dry lake Hamoun Puzak is the dominant source for all dust samples from Zabol and cultivated land is a secondary source. We found marked spatial variance in the importance of regional dry lake beds as dust sources, and temporal persistence in dust emissions from Hamoun Puzak, despite very large areas of adjacent lake beds drying during the study period. Aeolian sediment fingerprinting studies can benefit considerably from the constraints provided by modelling frameworks, such as GLUE, for quantifying the uncertainty in dust provenance data.

Whilst significantly reducing the risk of microcystin exposure, there is little data describing the levels of these toxins present in cyanobacterial blooms. This study focused on the quantitative LC-MS/MS analysis of microcystins in freshwater samples, collected across England during 2016 and found to contain potentially toxin-producing cyanobacteria. More than 50% of samples contained quantifiable concentrations of microcystins, with approximately 13% exceeding the WHO medium health threshold of 20 g/L. Toxic samples were confirmed over a nine-month period, with a clear increase in toxins during late summer, but with no apparent geographical patterns. No statistical relationships were found between total toxin concentrations and environmental parameters. Complex toxin profiles were determined and profile clusters were unrelated to cyanobacterial species, although a dominance of MC-RR was determined in water samples from sites associated with lower rainfall. 100% of samples with toxins above the 20 g/L limit contained cell densities above 20,000 cells/mL or cyanobacterial scum, showing the current regime is suitable for public health. Conversely, with only 18% of cell density threshold samples having total microcystins above 20 g/L, there is the potential for reactive water closures to unnecessarily impact upon the socio-economics of the local population. In the future, routine analysis of bloom samples by LC-MS/MS would provide a beneficial confirmatory approach to the current microscopic assessment, aiding both public health and the needs of water users and industry.

The site environment consists of extant wetlands and paleo-wetland deposits found in depressions between sand dunes derived from the Yarlung Tsangpo floodplain. Constraining C-14 dates from wetland vegetation and shell from one site fall between ca. 6600-2600 cal. yr B.P., while a second site is dated 3400-1200 cal. yr B.P. A significant and variable C-14 reservoir effectup to 1400 C-14 yrlimits these ranges to terminus post quem constraints. The in situ artifacts are supplemented by surface collections fully characterizing raw material and typological variability for each site. Raw material found at Zhongba is chert and chalcedony likely sourced from Cretaceous bedrock near the site. Typologically, microblades are nongeometric and are derived from conical and wedge-shaped cores similar to those identified in the Qinghai Lake Basin and the Chang Tang Nature Reserve of similar or greater age. The later occupation period at Zhongba is broadly contemporaneous with sites on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau containing bronze and iron artifacts, indicating microlithic technology remained an important tool-making strategy in western Tibet late into the protohistoric period.					; Olsen, John/AAB-6653-2022	Hudson, Adam/0000-0002-3387-9838; 													0883-6353	1520-6548				JAN	2014	29	1					33	46		10.1002/gea.21459	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/gea.21459													WOS:000328459800003

Ecological impact of transhumance on the trophic state of alpine lakes in Gran Paradiso National Park	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												Transhumance - the summer transfer of livestock to highland pastures is a traditional practice in the European Alps and is considered an integral part of the mountain ecosystem. Mountain lakes are generally oligotrophic systems and are particularly sensitive to the nutrient input caused by livestock. The aim of the present study was to quantify the impact of livestock grazing on the trophic state of high-altitude lakes in an area where transhumance is a traditional practice (Gran Paradiso National Park, Western Italian Alps), taking into account its dual value of ecosystem component and potential threat to lakes' trophic status. The impact of flocks and herds grazing was estimated on sensitive parameters related to the trophic state of alpine lakes: water transparency, nutrient content, bacterial load and chlorophyll-a concentration. Transhumance produced a significant increase in the trophic state of lakes with high grazing pressure, but little or no effect was found at soft-impacted lakes. Even though heavy-impacted lakes represent a minority of the studied lakes (three out of twenty), we indicated conservation measures such as fencing, wastewater treatment and livestock exclosure to be tested in Gran Paradiso National Park.

We investigated the role of microbial source tracking (MST) as a complement to routine beach monitoring at Chicago beaches. In summer 2016, water samples from nine Chicago beaches were analyzed for E. coli by culture and enterococci by qPCR. A total of 195 archived samples were then tested for human (HF183/BacR287, HumM2), canine (DG3, DG37), and avian (GFD) microbial source tracking (MST) markers. Associations between MST and general fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) measures were evaluated and stratified based on wet and dry weather definitions. Among the 195 samples, HF183/BacR287 was quantifiable in 4%, HumM2 in 1%, DG3 in 6%, DG37 in 2%, and GFD in 23%. The one beach with a dog area was far more likely to have DG3 present in the quantifiable range than other beaches. Exceedance of general FIB BAVs increased the odds of human, dog and avian marker detection. MST marker weighted-average fecal scores for DG3 was 2.4 times, DG37 was 2.1 times, and GFD was 1.6 times higher during wet compared to dry weather conditions. HF183/BacR287 weighted-average fecal scores were not associated with precipitation. Associations between FIB BAV exceedance and MST marker detection were generally stronger in wet weather. Incorporating MST testing into routine beach water monitoring can provide information that beach managers can use when developing protection plans for beaches not impacted by point sources.

A seasonally modulated earthquake swarm near Maupin, Oregon	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL												From December 2006 to November 2011, the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network (PNSN) reported 467 earthquakes in a swarm 60 km east of Mt Hood near the town of Maupin, Oregon. The swarm included 20 M-D a parts per thousand yen 3.0 events, which account for over 80 per cent of the cumulative seismic moment release of the sequence. Relocation of 45 M-D a parts per thousand yen 2.5 earthquakes and moment tensor analysis of nine 3.3 a parts per thousand currency sign M-w a parts per thousand currency sign 3.9 earthquakes reveals right-lateral strike-slip motion on a north-northwest trending, 70A degrees west dipping, 1 km(2) active fault patch at about 17 km depth. The swarm started at the southern end of the patch and migrated to the northwest at an average rate of 1-2 m d(-1) during the first 18 months. Event migration was interrupted briefly in late 2007 when the swarm encountered a 10A degrees fault bend acting as geometrical barrier. The slow migration rate suggests a pore pressure diffusion process. We speculate that the swarm was triggered by flow into the fault zone from upwards-migrating, subduction-derived fluids. Superimposed on the swarm is seasonal modulation of seismicity, with the highest rates in spring, which coincides with the maximum snow load in the nearby Cascade Mountains. The resulting surface load variation of about 4 x 10(11) N km(-1) arc length causes 1 cm annual vertical displacements at GPS sites in the Cascades and appears sufficient to modulate seismicity by varying normal stresses at the fault and fluid flow rates into the fault zone.

We developed algorithms to discriminate potentially toxic cyanobacterial blooms from other harmless phytoplankton blooms and to extract relative phycocyanin abundances from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) satellite data. Lee's quasi-analytical algorithm Was used to calculate total absorption and backscatter from the 250 m, 500 m and 1 km bands of MODIS scenes. A non-negative least square algorithm was then utilized to discern relative concentrations of Chlorophyta (green algae), phycocyanin-rich Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae), and colored dissolved organic matter and suspended sediments combined in lake waters using published absorption spectra for these components. MODIS-derived cyanobacterial concentrations and/or bloom distributions from 10 scenes acquired in the summers of 2004 and 2005 were successfully verified against contemporaneous calibrated measurements of pigments that were acquired from measurements made using continuous fluorimetric measurements of surface water (1 m depth) from six cruises, and three additional cyanobacterial blooms reported in the scientific literature between 2002 and 2006. These results demonstrate that this methodology could be used to develop a cost-effective practical screening method for rapid detection and warning of potentially toxic cyanobacterial blooms in the lower Great Lakes.

Piping Plover Habitat Selection and Nest Success on Natural, Managed, and Engineered Sandbars	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Loss of breeding habitat and nest predation have contributed to the decline of many shorebird species. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) initiated a piping plover (Charadrius melodus) habitat creation and augmentation program on the Missouri River in the summer of 2004. The USACE increased unvegetated sandbar habitat by depositing dredged material (engineered sandbars) and by clearing vegetation from existing sandbars (managed sandbars). We evaluated the effects of this increase in nesting and foraging habitat on habitat selection and nest daily survival rate (DSR) of piping plovers on Lewis and Clark Lake and the Gavins Point Reach of the Missouri River from 2005 to 2007 (n = 623 nests). Piping plovers selected engineered sandbars more often than expected based on area and selected natural and managed habitats less than expected based on area. Daily survival rate on engineered sandbars was significantly higher than on natural or managed sandbars (log odds: 2.50, 95% CI: 1.05-5.94). Thus, plovers' habitat selection may have increased their nesting success. Our results suggest that habitat augmentation may stave off declines in piping plover populations limited by insufficient habitat and low nesting success.

In this paper, considering the time-lag effect of landscape index on crane population, the Landsat satellite images of Poyang Lake wetland in 19 winter periods from 2001 to 2019 were selected. The land-use types of the images were classified by support vector machine to acquire the landscape pattern index. In addition, the Pearson test was adopted to examine the correlation between crane population dynamics and landscape pattern index during overwintering. Finally, the regression model of the crane population was obtained by multivariate linear regression analysis. The results showed that the landscape index had a delayed impact on the crane population, which was significantly correlated with the crane population in the following five years. This effect on different crane population was disparate. The number of siberian cranes and white-naped crane populations showed a downward trend, while that of hooded cranes and common crane populations showed an upward trend. Furthermore, the landscape index affects the crane population to a certain extent, but the landscape pattern has diverse effects on different crane populations. It is suggested that corresponding protection measures be taken for different crane pop-ulations to provide a better habitat for cranes in Poyang Lake.					; Li, Pengfei/H-9093-2019	Gao, Xiang/0000-0003-2442-1662; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				MAY	2023	149								110183	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110183	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110183		MAR 2023											WOS:000967684900001

Data were collected through structured interview schedule from 150 respondents from fishermen community between July and September 2020. It was found that 34.7% of the respondents fall in to the age group of 41-50 years and 56.0% were married. Majority of the respondents were illiterate (61.3%) and over half of the respondents (59.3%) earned monthly Rs.1000-5000. The study also explored that 93.3% of the respondents lived in their owned houses. The family size of fishing community was usually consisted of 7-10 members and 51.3% of them lived in a joint family system. However, most of them (54.66%) were dependent on river/ canal water as drinking source and 59.3% were having dry latrine. It may be concluded that the fishermen community in the study area was the disadvantaged group of the society. Government, NGOs and respective stakeholders should come forward to take proper and necessary steps to improve their living conditions.																			2311-729X	2311-3111				DEC	2021	9	3							93205															WOS:000754637400006

CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												Historically, seed banks conferred resilience to Laurentian Great Lakes coastal wetlands by providing propagules of many species to replace invasive plants, such as Typha x glauca Godr. After flooding, the seed bank could allow recovery of wetland composition and structure as the water levels fall. Using the seedling emergence method to estimate seed density, species and guild richness, and floristic quality, we evaluated the resilience of five wetlands along the western coast of Green Bay, Lake Michigan by comparing seed bank attributes in areas invaded by Typha to those of neighboring uninvaded areas and to attributes of the extant vegetation. Resilience decreased from north to south among the five wetlands, mirroring a gradient of decreasing water quality. The invasive Lythrum salicaria L. dominated the seed bank of all five wetlands despite low relative abundance in the extant vegetation. The resilience of Green Bay coastal wetlands is threatened by the overwhelming presence of L.asalicaria in the seed bank. Because the seed bank holds a wetland's potential to be renewed by the natural hydrological cycle, seed bank assessment should be a routine measure of wetland resilience.																			0008-4026					DEC	2006	84	12					1882	U16		10.1139/B06-100	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/B06-100													WOS:000244858700012

Maximum potential dispersal in the Assiniboine, Little Saskatchewan, Souris, and Rat rivers has been realized due to the presence of dams. Absence of Stonecats upstream of these dams suggests that the records of the species in Manitoba in the 1920s are erroneous, and instead supports a more recent invasion coinciding with the first authenticated record in 1969. Collection records of the species from the United States portion of the Red River support the theory of natural invasion from the upper Mississippi River drainage to the headwaters of the Red River drainage at Lake Traverse during high spring meltwater conditions. Further range extensions in the Hudson Bay drainage may occur in Lake Winnipeg and the rivers flowing into it. This may be limited by the minimum water temperature at which Stonecats will spawn.																			0008-3550					APR-JUN	1998	112	2					217	224																WOS:000075085600005

Time-lapse camera observations of gas piston activity at Pu'u 'O'o, Kilauea volcano, Hawai'i	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												Gas pistoning is a type of eruptive behavior described first at KA << lauea volcano and characterized by the (commonly) cyclic rise and fall of the lava surface within a volcanic vent or lava lake. Though recognized for decades, its cause continues to be debated, and determining why and when it occurs has important implications for understanding vesiculation and outgassing processes at basaltic volcanoes. Here, we describe gas piston activity that occurred at the Pu'u 'AOE'Ai cone, in KA << lauea's east rift zone, during June 2006. Direct, detailed measurements of lava level, made from time-lapse camera images captured at close range, show that the gas pistons during the study period lasted from 2 to 60 min, had volumes ranging from 14 to 104 m(3), displayed a slowing rise rate of the lava surface, and had an average gas release duration of 49 s. Our data are inconsistent with gas pistoning models that invoke gas slug rise or a dynamic pressure balance but are compatible with models which appeal to gas accumulation and loss near the top of the lava column, possibly through the generation and collapse of a foam layer.																			0258-8900	1432-0819				DEC	2012	74	10					2353	2362		10.1007/s00445-012-0667-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00445-012-0667-0													WOS:000312060000010

The size and developmental stage of larvae in the littoral and pelagic zones were compared to assess the suitability of these habitats for larval development and to analyse the possible movement of larvae between zones. In all study lakes, the distribution of European whitefish larvae was restricted primarily to the littoral zone, whereas the distribution of vendace larvae was more variable: in certain lakes, most of the larvae spent their first weeks in the littoral zone, whereas in other lakes, a large proportion of the larvae utilized the pelagic zone or were more evenly distributed between both zones. The littoral-pelagic distribution of newly-hatched coregonid larvae seems to depend on the spawning depth of the fish. The growth of vendace larvae in the pelagic zone seems similar to that in the littoral zone, and the pelagic zone appears to be a suitable nursery area for vendace larvae. In contrast, pelagic European whitefish larvae shifted to the littoral zone soon after hatching.					; Helminen, Harri/HZJ-8267-2023; Sarvala, Jouko/J-8962-2019; Karjalainen, Juha/B-4079-2015	Huuskonen, Hannu/0000-0001-5609-768X; Marjomaki, Timo J./0000-0002-0563-3099; Karjalainen, Juha/0000-0001-9302-1174													0071-1128		3-510-47059-1				2002	57						367	382																WOS:000180355400031

There is concern that fish communities in these wetlands may be isolated from adjacent waters. However, Little data are available with which to evaluate possible Isolation. We conducted a study that examined spring length frequencies, age structure, and growth of white crappie (Pomoxis annularis) populations in 3 diked wetlands and 2 undiked, adjacent areas. If populations are not isolated then differences in population parameters between the two types of systems should not be evident. White crappies were collected in April-May 1987 using trap nets. Length frequencies of white crappies were not similar between diked wetlands and adjacent areas, and mean lengths were significantly less in the diked wetlands. Populations were not comprised of similar age classes in the 5 systems. White crappies in diked wetlands grew significantly slower than their conspecifics in the undiked areas. These data indicate that white crappies in diked wetlands are isolated from populations in undiked areas even though up to 75% of water in diked wetlands can be exchanged each year.																			0030-0950					SEP	1997	97	4					72	77																WOS:000074982500002
J	Saeed, SH; Hassan, SY				Saeed, Saeed Hassan; Hassan, Sabah Yousif			Determination of Radon, Uranium and Other Radioactive Isotopes' Concentration in Different Types of Natural Water in Nenava Governorate	JORDAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS												Radon (222Rn) is a naturally occurring radioactive gas with a half-life of 3.82 days, released from the normal decay of the elements uranium, thorium and radium in rocks and soil. It is an invisible, colourless, odourless and chemically inert gas and has no taste. Radon is fairly soluble in water and organic solvents and seeps up through the ground and diffuses into the air. It dissolves into ground water and surface water and can be released into the air when water is used. Radon is also present outdoors and indoors, but it is normally found at very low levels in outdoor air and in water from rivers and lakes. Water represents the most important source for life and forms up (70-75)% of the total body weight. While 70% of the world's surface is covered by water, only 0.3 % of the total water resources on earth is drinkable and suitable for daily use. Human race provides its water from surface water and ground water. Ground water is more radioactive than surface water, since it passes through rock and soil formations, dissolving many compounds, minerals and radioactive substances. Naturally occurring radioactive material in groundwater (springs and wells) mainly comes from the uranium decay series with major members of concern for human health being U-238 and U-234, Ra-226, Rn-222 and Pb-210. The concentrations of the radionuclides may vary over a wide range, depending on the bedrock in which the aquifer is located as well as the water parameters such as pH, Eh and alkalinity. Radon decays into solid radioactive elements called radon daughters or radon progeny, such as 218Po, 214Po, 214Bi and Pb-214. These daughters can attach to dust and other particles and can be breathed into the lungs. As radon and radon progeny in the air decay, they give off alpha particles, a form of high-energy radiation. When inhaled, these radioactive particles can damage the DNA inside the body's cells and also damage the cells that line the lung. Long-term exposure to radon can lead to lung cancer, the only cancer proven to be associated with inhaling radon. There has been a suggestion of increased risk of leukemia associated with radon exposure in adults and children. The contribution to the mean effective dose equivalent from inhalation of Rn-222 and its shortlived decay products Po-218, Po-214, Bi-214 and Pb-214 is estimated to be about 50% of the total effective dose equivalent from natural radiation sources. The presence of Rn-222 in the environment and ground waters is associated mainly with trace amounts of uranium and its immediate parent, radium (Ra-226), in rocks and soil. Radon can easily lose from water when it is agitated; for example, when river or other water sources flow over rocks or are moved by wind. Natural water and drinking water may contain varying levels of radioactivity. It is therefore important to determine the radon and the radium levels as well as other radionuclides' levels in water for public health and radiation protection. This paper presents results of radon (Rn-222), radium (Ra-226), uranium (U-238), Bismuth (Bi-214) and potassium (K-40) concentrations in underground water (springs and wells), surface water (from rivers and lakes), drinking water from different sources as well as rain water in Nenava governorate in Iraq. Thirty four (34) samples of natural waters were brought from different sources: projects of tapwater, underground wells, pure and mineral springs, as well as rain water in Nenava governerate. Long-term technique for alpha particles emission with solid state nuclear track detector (SSNTD) CR-39 and short-term technique for gamma spectroscopy with high purity germanium detectors (HPGe) have been used to determine the concentrations of radon (Rn-222), uranium (U-238) and other radioactive isotopes, such as radium (Ra-226), bismuth (Bi-214) and potassium (K-40) in the water samples. The solid state detector CR-39 was exposed to water samples for 95 days within the period from 23/12/2003 to 5/4/2004, except that for rain water sample the period of exposure was from 25/1 to 30/4/2004, to measure the concentrations of radon, radium and uranium in the water samples through alpha particles' emission, while multi-channel analyzer was used to determine the concentrations of potassium and uranium through gamma-ray emission from these samples. The results showed concentrations between (0.838-1.758) Bq. L-1 for radon (Rn-222) with high value in rain water. Uranium (U-234) concentration has ranged between (67-142) ppb and (73.2-138.3) ppb using SSNTD and HPGe techniques, respectively, and these values are lower than the maximum allowed concentration of dissolved uranium in drinking water which is about 9000 ppm. Concerning radium (Ra-226), its level ranged between (2.29-4.8)*10(-5) ppb, while the concentration of potassium (K-40) was (6.525-10.125) Bq. L-1 and that of bismuth (Bi-214) was (5.179 -9.446) Bq. L-1. The annual effective dose of radon was calculated, and it ranged between (4.40-9.24) mu sv. y(-1) in case of ingestion and (2.30-4.82) mu sv. y(-1) in case of inhalation. These values are regarded less in comparison with the allowed normal limit which is about 0.1 msv. y(-1) for drinking water. In general, the concentrations of radon in natural waters are less than the maximum allowed limit which is about 18 Bq. L-1, and there will be no risk on the human being life.

J	IRWIN, ER; BETTOLI, PW				IRWIN, ER; BETTOLI, PW			INTRODUCED CLUPEIDS IN A SOUTHERN RESERVOIR - MORE EVIDENCE FOR SYSTEM-SPECIFIC REPRODUCTIVE STYLES	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Latitudinal trends in reproductive characteristics are evident for some species of Clupeidae. However, selection for life history styles may operate at the population level. The reproductive cycles of alewife Alosa pseudaharengus and threadfin shad Dorosoma petenense in Dale Hollow Reservoir, Tennessee, were monitored over two spawning seasons on the basis of a gonadosomatic index (GSI). Inshore movements normally associated with spawning migrations were monitored using gill nets in spring 1989. GSI values peaked for both species at least one month earlier in 1989 than in 1988 due to warmer water temperatures earlier in the year. Highest GSI values for female alewife occurred each year when surface water temperatures were about 20 degrees C; threadfin shad GSI values peaked at temperatures of 22 degrees-26 degrees C. Trends in male GSI values in both species were similar to those in females. Alewives were not abundant in warm (> 22 degrees C), shallow water after I May 1989, but alewife GSI values remained high after this date, suggesting that elevated inshore temperatures limited alewife reproduction. All aspects of alewife reproduction were comparable to other populations of alewife but did not follow latitudinal trends. Threadfin shad reproductive characteristics were similar to other published accounts. We suggest that thermal regimes and reservoir trophic status are important factors for clupeid reproduction and population-level analysis is suggested when considering reproductive styles. Further, our ability to predict the ecology of introduced species in freshwater systems is impaired when species considered have not coevolved or evolved in marine environments.																			0378-1909					FEB	1995	42	2					151	159		10.1007/BF00001993	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00001993													WOS:A1995QJ80800005

Analysis of water stable isotopes fingerprinting to inform conservation management: Lake Urema Wetland System, Mozambique	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												The present study focusses on the analysis of water stable isotopes to contribute to understanding the hydrology of the Lake Urema wetland system in central Mozambique towards conservation management. Lake Urema Wetland is located in the Gorongosa National Park at the southernmost extent of the East African Rift System and is situated entirely within the Urema catchment. Of particular concern to the park's management is the understanding of hydrological processes as these may trigger transformations of ecosystems, habitat losses and wildlife migrations. Concerns over the Lake Urema wetland's drying up and the trapping of sediments in the floodplain have been raised for some time by conservationists. Water samples were collected for stable water isotope analyses during the wet and the dry seasons for the period 2006-2010 from springs, boreholes, rivers, and Lake Urema. In addition monthly composite precipitation was collected at two rain gauges. The results show that Lake Urema is maintained throughout the dry season merely from water generated during the wet season. It receives water from wet season precipitation and the runoff generated from this precipitation. The water source areas of the lake are the Gorongosa Mountain and the Barue Basement geomorphological units. Consequently, the source of the sediments which have been trapped into the lake and the floodplain has to be identified in these two catchment areas and urgent action is required to rescue the lake. This water body constitutes a groundwater buffer system which supports a unique wetland landscape. The annual inundations' processes leading to the recharge-drainage cycle in the floodplain are most sensitive to the deposition of sediments, changing hydraulic gradients, and reducing wet season inflows and increasing drainage rates.

Ecosystem Responses to Partial Harvesting in Eastern Boreal Mixedwood Stands	FORESTS												Partial harvesting has been proposed as a key aspect to implementing ecosystem management in the Canadian boreal forest. We report on a replicated experiment located in boreal mixedwoods of Northwestern Quebec. In the winter of 2000-2001, two partial harvesting treatments, one using a dispersed pattern, and a second, which created a (400 m(2)) gap pattern, were applied to a 90-year-old aspen-dominated mixed stand. The design also included a clear cut and a control. Over the course of the following eight years, live tree, coarse woody debris, regeneration and ground beetles were inventoried at variable intervals. Our results indicate that all harvesting treatments created conditions favorable to balsam fir (Abies balsamea) sapling growth and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) sapling recruitment. However, balsam fir and trembling aspen regeneration and ground beetles response to gap cuts were closer to patterns observed in clear cuts than in dispersed harvesting. The underlying reasons for these differing patterns can be linked to factors associated with the contrasting light regimes created by the two partial harvesting treatments. The study confirms that partially harvesting is an ecologically sound approach in boreal mixedwoods and could contribute to maintaining the distribution of stand ages at the landscape level.					; Celentano, Danielle/NLN-6715-2025; Bose, Arun/AAJ-9711-2021	Camargo Celentano Augusto, Danielle/0000-0003-4888-3693; KANTI BOSE, ARUN/0000-0001-8581-1651														1999-4907				JUN	2013	4	2					364	385		10.3390/f4020364	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f4020364													WOS:000320773200010

How Ice Composition Controls Radiatively Driven Convection Under Lake Ice	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Light transmission through the ice cover of lakes can heat near-surface waters and result in radiatively driven convection (RDC), a prominent source of under-ice water motion in spring. We investigate the impact of ice composition on the under-ice water column using fully resolved two-dimensional numerical simulations of the water that account for light attenuation by both ice and water. Increasing the amount of opaque white ice (relative to that of transparent black ice) decreases thermal forcing of the water and delays Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities and convective mixing. Other key environmental factors include the attenuation length scale of light and initial stratification of the water column. We determine whether and when (a) the water column first becomes unstable and (b) RDC is initiated. Notably, RDC is delayed by a period of growth of a gravitationally unstable layer. These findings have implications for the cycling of nutrients and gases, and wider ecosystem dynamics.

Assessment of invasive aquatic plant dynamics in the Lake Burullus wetland complex integrating remote sensing techniques	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The spread of invasive aquatic species in canals and wetlands poses significant challenges, including reduced water availability, disruption of native biodiversity, and obstruction of irrigation infrastructure. This study examines the distribution and environmental associations of two prominent invasive species Pontederia crassipes and Pistia stratiotes within the Lake Burullus wetland in Egypt. Field surveys were conducted to assess plant morphology and abundance, alongside measurements of water quality parameters including dissolved oxygen (DO), phosphate (PO4-P), ammonium (NH4-N), nitrite (NO2-N), nitrate (NO3-N), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), turbidity, and oxidizable organic matter (OOM). Remote sensing data, particularly the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), were used to monitor the spatial and seasonal dynamics of Pontederia in the Elshaklouba drain. The findings indicated that plant abundance was associated with specific water quality variables; however causality could not be determined due to the observational design of the study. NDVI analysis confirmed increased Pontederia densities during the summer months, consistent with field observations. The study also documented local management practices, primarily mechanical removal and the use of physical barriers, and briefly compared these with biological and integrated control strategies reported in recent literature. Additionally, the potential application of these species in phytoremediation and bioenergy applications is discussed, underscoring their dual role as both ecological threats and potential resources.

At present, however, the quantitative evaluation of temperature changes at multi-centennial-tomillennial timescales remains not well understood. In this study, we provide a high-quality mean annual temperature record for the past 2000 years based on branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) in a well-dated sediment core retrieved from Lake Poyang in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Our results show an overall pre-industrial cooling trend in the Poyang Lake region, with clear temperature changes associated with the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and Little Ice Age (LIA), consistent with local, regional, and global records. The centennial to millennial temperature fluctuations, particularly the pronounced cooling at approximately 1500 CE, generally agrees with changes in total solar irradiance, supporting the importance of solar activity in affecting pre-industrial temperature changes. Further comparisons with other biomarker-based quantitative temperature reconstructions revealed that the temperature offset between the MWP and LIA increased with latitude and elevation, suggesting that centennial-scale temperature fluctuations were amplified at higher elevations and latitudes during the past two millennia.

In the current study, different methods on how to assess the siltation status of different reservoir types are represented by including the availability of previous data. Four different techniques are described by means of detailed case studies, including topographic differencing as the most widely used method. Examples of sub-bottom profiling, dynamic free-fall penetrometer measurements, and long sediment coring also are presented. The methods are explained through the application of each technique under varying conditions. The aim of the current study was to assess the advantages and disadvantages of each method and to discuss each methods applicability, depending on the reservoir type, sediment characteristics, and sediment thickness. Based on the case studies and literature an overview table of available techniques for sediment detection was created including a qualitative estimation of the strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, a decision path is presented to choose the most promising technique dependent on the individual situation of a reservoir. With this review, sediment-related decisions are supported for dam operators and authorities as well as dredging companies.

Sakari; Valiranta, Minna; Weckstrom, Jan			Comparison of quantitative Holocene temperature reconstructions using multiple proxies from a northern boreal lake	HOLOCENE												Four biotic proxies (plant macrofossils, pollen, chironomids and diatoms) are employed to quantitatively reconstruct variations in mean July air temperatures (T-jul) at Lake Loitsana (northern Finland) during the Holocene. The aim is to evaluate the robustness and biases in these temperature reconstructions and to compare the timing of highest T-jul in the individual reconstructions. The reconstructed T-jul values are evaluated in relation to local-scale/site-specific processes associated with the Holocene lake development at Loitsana as these factors have been shown to significantly influence the fossil assemblages found in the Lake Loitsana sediments. While pollen-based temperatures follow the classical trend of gradually increasing early-Holocene T-jul with a mid-Holocene maximum, the aquatic/wetland assemblages reconstruct higher-than-present T-jul already during the early Holocene, that is, at the peak of summer insolation. The relatively low early-Holocene July temperatures recorded by the pollen are the result of site-specific factors possibly combined with a delayed response of the terrestrial ecosystem compared with the aquatic ecosystem. Our study shows that all reconstructions are influenced at least to some extent by local factors. This finding stresses the need to evaluate quantitatively reconstructed climate values against local lake development and highlights the benefit of using multi-proxy data in Holocene climate reconstructions.

The country's water resources are now seriously degraded. A high percentage of water abstractions are unauthorized. Some rivers have dried up during low-flow periods, and conflicts have broken out between groups of water users. Forest excisions and clearance lead to greater upstream use of water during dry periods, more variable flows, and higher sediment loads. Dams and pans silt up and coastal industries are affected. Groundwater is also being exploited unsustainably beneath Nairobi and possibly other urban areas. Urban sewage is discharged directly into water bodies because many sewage treatment plants are either not working or only partly working, and most industrial effluent is not treated before it is discharged. Agricultural chemicals (including banned pesticides) continue to reach rivers and lakes. Nutrient pollution of Lake Victoria from the atmosphere and rivers is now so advanced that about 20 percent of the Lake's volume is uninhabitable by most fish species.																			1726-5878		978-0-8213-6518-2; 978-0-8213-6517-5				2006		69					43	63				10.1596/978-0-8213-6517-5												WOS:000307360200005

Given imminent climate changes, it is crucial to catalogue these habitats in order to provide baseline data for future monitoring and biological surveys. The lacustrine systems of Clearwater Mesa, a previously unexplored part of James Ross Island, north-eastern Antarctic Peninsula, are described here. We conducted basic geomorphological and limnological surveys over three Antarctic summers (2009-16) to characterize landscape evolution, infer the origin of lake basins and assess the variability in their water chemistry. Stable shallow lakes, formed in depressions between lava tumuli following the last deglaciation, were found to dominate the volcanic mesa, although several peripheral lakes in ice-proximal settings appear to have formed recently as a result of post-Neoglacial ice recession. We found large heterogeneity in conductivity (similar to 10-7000 mu S cm(-1)), despite the lithologically uniform substrate. This variability was shown to be related to lake type, basin type (open vs closed), meltwater source and proximity to the coast. Inter-annual differences were attributed to changes in sea spray influx and snow accumulation driven by variable weather conditions. Overall, the ion composition of lakes suggested that sea spray was the dominant source of ions, followed by the weathering of bedrock.					; Kohler, Tyler J./I-5472-2016; Nedbalova, Linda/D-2792-2009; Kohler, Tyler Joe/IUO-5352-2023; Roman, Matěj/AAN-4194-2020; Nyvlt, Daniel/D-5708-2011; Lecomte, Karina/KHD-3796-2024; Nyvlt, Daniel/J-6504-2019; Elster, Josef/B-1031-2008; Kopacek, Jiri/A-7373-2014; Kopalová, Kateřina/M-6207-2017	Vignoni, Paula/0000-0002-9681-4986; Kopacek, Jiri/0000-0002-4409-4032; Roman, Matej/0000-0003-4741-5169; LECOMTE, KARINA LETICIA/0000-0001-6901-0918; Kohler, Tyler J./0000-0001-5137-4844; Nedbalova, Linda/0000-0003-1800-714X; Nyvlt, Daniel/0000-0002-6876-490X; Elster, Josef/0000-0002-4535-5636; 													0954-1020	1365-2079				AUG	2019	31	4					169	188	PII S0954102019000178	10.1017/S0954102019000178	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954102019000178													WOS:000478614300001

In order to improve water quality, restoration programs are implemented, including numerous methods. Intense nutrient cycling resulting from detrimental role of sediments impede obtaining of clear water state. One of the restoration methods proposed in recent years was Effective Microorganisms (EM), i.e. the set of microorganisms aiming at the inhibition of harmful bacteria through competitive exclusion. This approach was introduced in shallow Konin Lake(Western Poland), suffering from severe cyanobacterial water blooms. Prior to the treatment, protective action was conducted i.e. the elimination of external nutrient loads with backwater from the river. Changes in water chemistry, phytoplankton structure and macrophytes distribution were noted during the 5-year studies (2011-2015), covering the treatment (2013-2015) as well as two previous years. Oscillatoriacean cyanobacteria were most abundant in (2011-2012), while Nostocales in summer 2014-2015, as a result of decreased phosphorus but increased nitrogen concentrations. Slight increase in Cladoceran zooplankton was observed, but none in submerged macrophytes due to low water transparency. EM application initiated positive changes in the ecosystem by means of excessive organic matter decomposition and increased diversity of phytoplankton, nevertheless cyanobacteria blooms were still present due to high nutrient content.

Suspended matter content of the lake is 10-200 mg dry matter .cntdot. l-1, which originates predominantly from the constantly stirred up sediment and biogenic calcium carbonate precipitating during algal photosynthesis. The algal content has greatly increased recently but the composition of suspended matter content could not change fundamentally for the great amount of mineral components. Composition, size distribution and seasonal dynamics of suspended materials were investigated for a whole year. Parallel with what the intestinal contents of 1300 D. cucullata Sars individuals were also studied. The greatest part of suspended materials belonged to the 0.01-10.00 .mu.m fraction, 50% of which was HCl-soluble crystalline mineral matter. The ratio between mineral granules and bacterium cells was 4-5 to 1 and that between granules and suspended algal cells 100-300 to 1. Even more granules fell to each dead organic particle. D. cucullata is a prodigious ballast feeder, an automatic consumer of granules. The intestinal contents were very poor in digestible materials. The algae (Coelosphaerium, Cyclotella, Coelastrum) were recovered in almost undamaged condition from the gut contents. It is likely that Rhodomonas, Cryptomonas, Chrysidalis, Chlamydomonas and other green algae and bacteria < 20 .mu.m and difficult to detect represented the actual food. It is also imaginable that after precipitation the dissolved organic materials of lake water also form an important nutrient source for the filter-feeding organisms.																			0003-9136						1984	101	4					531	553																WOS:A1984TQ05300005

Bacterial Communities in Concrete Reflect Its Composite Nature and Change with Weathering	MSYSTEMS												Concrete is an extreme but common environment and is home to microbial communities adapted to alkaline, saline, and oligotrophic conditions. Microbes inside the concrete that makes up buildings or roads have received little attention despite their ubiquity and capacity to interact with the concrete. Because concrete is a composite of materials which have their own microbial communities, we hypothesized that the microbial communities of concrete reflect those of the concrete components and that these communities change as the concrete ages. Here, we used a 16S amplicon study to show how microbial communities change over 2 years of outdoor weathering in two sets of concrete cylinders, one prone to the concrete-degrading alkali-silica reaction (ASR) and the other having the risk of the ASR mitigated. After identifying and removing taxa that were likely laboratory or reagent contaminants, we found that precursor materials, particularly the large aggregate (gravel), were the probable source of similar to 50 to 60% of the bacteria observed in the first cylinders from each series. Overall, community diversity decreased over 2 years, with temporarily increased diversity in warmer summer months. We found that most of the concrete microbiome was composed of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria, although community composition changed seasonally and over multiyear time scales and was likely influenced by environmental deposition. Although the community composition between the two series was not significantly different overall, several taxa, including Arcobacter, Modestobacter, Salinicoccus, Rheinheimera, Lawsonella, and Bryobacter, appear to be associated with ASR. IMPORTANCE Concrete is the most-used building material in the world and a biologically extreme environment, with a microbiome composed of bacteria that likely come from concrete precursor materials, aerosols, and environmental deposition. These microbes, though seeded from a variety of materials, are all subject to desiccation, heating, starvation, high salinity, and very high pH. Microbes that survive and even thrive under these conditions can potentially either degrade concrete or contribute to its repair. Thus, understanding which microbes survive in concrete, under what conditions, and for how long has potential implications for biorepair of concrete. Further, methodological pipelines for analyzing concrete microbial communities can be applied to concrete from a variety of structures or with different types of damage to identify bioindicator species that can be used for structural health monitoring and service life prediction.					; Kiledal, Anders/KEJ-5871-2024; Keffer, Jessica/ABC-1636-2020	Maresca, Julia/0000-0002-3955-1585; Keffer, Jessica/0000-0002-0302-3588; Kiledal, Anders/0000-0003-4565-2187; 														2379-5077				MAY-JUN	2021	6	3							e01153-20	10.1128/mSystems.01153-20	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/mSystems.01153-20								33947799					WOS:000648693300009

Effects of cyanobacterial-driven pH increases on sediment nutrient fluxes and coupled nitrification-denitrification in a shallow fresh water estuary	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Summer cyanobacterial blooms caused an elevation in pH (9 to similar to 10.5) that lasted for weeks in the shallow and tidal-fresh region of the Sassafras River, a tributary of Chesapeake Bay (USA). Elevated pH promoted desorption of sedimentary inorganic phosphorus and facilitated conversion of ammonium (NH4+) to ammonia (NH3). In this study, we investigated pH effects on exchangeable NH4+ desorption, pore water diffusion and the flux rates of NH4+, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and nitrate (NO3-), nitrification, denitrification, and oxygen consumption. Elevated pH enhanced desorption of exchangeable NH4+ through NH3 formation from both pore water and adsorbed NH4+ pools. Progressive penetration of high pH from the overlying water into sediment promoted the mobility of SRP and the release of total ammonium (NH4+ and NH3) into the pore water. At elevated pH levels, high sediment-water effluxes of SRP and total ammonium were associated with reduction of nitrification, denitrification and oxygen consumption rates. Alkaline pH and the toxicity of NH3 may inhibit nitrification in the thin aerobic zone, simultaneously constraining coupled nitrification-denitrification with limited NO3- supply and high pH penetration into the anaerobic zone. Geochemical feedbacks to pH elevation, such as enhancement of dissolved nutrient effluxes and reduction in N-2 loss via denitrification, may enhance the persistence of cyanobacterial blooms in shallow water ecosystems.

In this paper a detailed geochemical and mineralogical record of these changes is presented from a distal alluvial fan sedimentary sequence in the northern Weihe Basin. We established that, in addition to glacial-interglacial variation, there are three distinctly different units deposited over the past 1 m.y. These units are the result of variations in the overall tectonic regime in the northern Weihe Basin. Fine-grained detrital minerals were predominantly delivered during colder climatic periods, whereas evaporative minerals were dominantly deposited during the warmer, interglacial periods, probably as a result of strong seasonal contrast. This compositional variation demonstrates the importance of climate control on hinterland erosion, surface runoff, chemical weathering and evaporation. Al-normalized ratios of indicative major elements relative to average loess composition, indicate important variations in sedimentary processes, mostly related to sediment flux. Si-enrichment is an index for past flooding events, while Fe enrichment, just like K and Ti, reflects influx of clays. In contrast, Ca and Mn are strongly enriched throughout the core, associated with the authigenic precipitation of carbonates, especially during interglacial periods. The lower (similar to 1000-690 ka) and upper (similar to 330-0 ka) units of the core are characterized by relative intense and frequent flooding, which coincided with extensive ponding in the study area. In the middle unit (similar to 690-330 ka) increased salinity levels caused by evaporation, as reflected in the high Sr/Ca ratio and dolomite abundance, led to increased carbonate precipitation. Simultaneously, the increased influx of fine sediments indicates increased clay production in the source area as a result of a more intense summer monsoon strength after 600 ka.

Documented impacts of invasive zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) and spiny water fleas (Bythotrephes cederstromii; hereafter Bythotrephes) on native fishes are variable and context dependent across locations and time periods. Here, we use a hierarchical Bayesian analysis of a 35-year dataset on two fish species from 9 lakes to demonstrate that early life growth of ecologically important fishes are influenced by these aquatic invasive species. Walleye (Sander vitreus) in their first year of life grew more slowly in the presence of either invader after correcting for temperature (measured by degree days), and were on average 12 or 14% smaller at the end of their first summer following invasion by Bythotrephes or zebra mussels, respectively. Yellow perch (Perca flavescens) growth was less affected by invasion. Yellow perch on average grew more slowly in their first year of life following invasion by zebra mussels, although this effect was not statistically distinguishable from zero. Early life growth of both walleye and yellow perch was less tightly coupled to degree days in invaded systems, as demonstrated by increased variance surrounding the degree day-length relationship. Smaller first-year size is related to walleye survival and recruitment to later life stages and has important implications for lake food webs and fisheries management. Future research quantifying effects of zebra mussels and Bythotrephes on other population-level processes and across a wider gradient of lake types is needed to understand the mechanisms driving observed changes in walleye growth.

The highways are severely threatened by rockfalls or landslide events after the 2017 Ms 7.0 Jiuzhaigou earthquake. Field survey (September 14-18th, 2017, May 15-20th, 2018, and September 9-17th, 2018), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and satellite image identified high-relief rockfalls and road construction rockfalls or landslides along the highway. Rockfall hazard is qualitatively evaluated using block count, velocity, and flying height through a 3D rockfall simulation at local and regional scales. Rockfall risk is quantitatively assessed with rockfall event probability, propagation probability, spatial probability, and vulnerability for different block volume classes. Approximately 21.5%, 20.5%, and 5.3% of the road mileage was found to be subject to an unacceptable (UA) risk class for vehicles along S301, Z120, and Z128 highways, respectively. Approximately 20.1% and 3.3% of the road mileage belong to the UA risk class for tourists along Z120 and Z128 highways, respectively. Results highlighted that high-relief rockfall events were intensively located at K50 to K55 (Guanmenzi to Ganheba) and K70 to K72 (Jiudaoguai to Shangsizhai Village) road mileages along S301 highway and KZ18 to KZ22 (Five Flower Lake to Arrow Bamboo Lake) road mileages, KZ30 (Swan Lake to Virgin Forests), and KY10.5 kilometers in Jiuzhai Valley. Rockfalls in these locations were classified under the UA risk class and medium to very high hazard index. Road construction rockfalls were located at K67 (Jiuzhai Paradise) and K75-K76 kilometers along S301 highway and KZ12 to KZ14 (Rhino Lake to Nuorilang Waterfall), KZ16.5 to KZ17.5 (Golden Bell Lake), KY5 (Lower Seasonal Lake), and KY14 (Upper Seasonal Lake) kilometers along Z120 and Z128 highway in Jiuzhai Valley. Rockfalls in these areas were within a reasonable practicable risk to UA risk class and very low to medium hazard index. Finally, defensive measures, including flexible nets, concrete walls, and artificial tunnels, could be selected appropriately on the basis of the rockfall hazard index and risk class. This study revealed the integration between qualitative rockfall hazard assessment and quantitative rockfall risk assessment, which is crucial in studying rockfall prevention and mitigation.					; XU, JIANXIANG/HCH-2510-2022; Li, Xiaomin/A-4674-2015; SUN, Chunwei/KMA-7711-2024	Ling, Sixiang/0000-0001-9697-1212; Sun, Chunwei/0000-0003-4449-2855; 													1672-6316	1993-0321				JUN	2019	16	6					1318	1335		10.1007/s11629-018-5355-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-018-5355-x													WOS:000471607300008

Ecology of purple sulfur bacteria in the highly stratified meromictic Lake Shunet (Siberia, Khakassia) in 2002-2009	MICROBIOLOGY												Phototrophic sulfur bacteria form dense accumulations in the chemocline zones of stratified lakes where light reaches the sulfide-containing layers of water. Many works are dedicated to the ecophysiology of these microorganisms in meromictic lakes. However, the role of these microorganisms in the trophic network of these ecosystems, the ways of biomass utilization, and the contribution to the turnover of biogenic elements have so far been insufficiently understood. This work deals with the analysis of many years' seasonal dynamics of the biomass of purple sulfur bacteria and the physicochemical conditions of their environment in Lake Shunet (Siberia, Khakassia, Russia), unraveling the causes of their anomalous development in the chemocline of this lake, as well as the comparative analysis of such type of ecosystems. Lake Shunet is characterized by markedly pronounced stratification and the high density of purple sulfur bacteria (PSB) in the chemocline, which is comparable to that of Lake Mahoney (Canada) where the number of PSB is the greatest among those known in the world. It was shown that, in the period 2002-2009, the total amount of bacterio-chlorophyll a in the water column of Lake Shunet increased and did not correlate with the seasonal variations in temperature and illumination in the chemocline. It was established that PSB cells in the purple layer experienced the effect of self-shading. The sedimentation rate of purple sulfur bacteria in Lake Shunet was low due to the pronounced density gradient in the chemocline zone. Thus, the high number of PSB in the chemocline was due to the combination of strong illumination, a high sulfide concentration, and a high water density gradient, which was responsible for stable stratification and contributed to the accumulation of the cells in a narrow layer. The data obtained could be useful for the paleoreconstruction of climatically deter-mined changes in the level of the lake and its periods of meromixis by the presence of carotenoids and bacte-riochlorophylls in the bottom sediments.

J	Hlevca, B; Howell, ET; Valipour, R; Madani, M				Hlevca, Bogdan; Howell, Edward Todd; Valipour, Reza; Madani, Mohammad			Modeling nearshore-offshore water exchange in Lake Ontario	PLOS ONE												The water quality and resources of Lake Ontario's nearshore ecosystem undergo heightened stress, particularly along the northwest shoreline. Hydrodynamic processes linking the distinct nearshore and offshore trophic structures play a crucial role in transporting nutrient-loaded water along and across the shore. Despite the pivotal connection between algae growth and the development of nuisance proportions, the scales over which these processes operate remain poorly understood. This study delves into the exchange dynamics between nearshore and offshore areas of Lake Ontario throughout 2018, employing a validated three-dimensional numerical model. A virtual passive age tracer is utilized to discern horizontal mixing time scales between nearshore regions of the lake (water depth < 30 m) and offshore locations. The dispersal pattern, as revealed by a passive tracer released from eight points around the model lake's perimeter, indicates more extensive diffusion in late summer when lake-wide stratification is established, compared to the mixed period. Coastal upwelling events, leading to intrusions of hypolimnetic waters, significantly contribute to net cross-shore transport, with the most pronounced effects observed in May and June when the offshore thermocline is shallow. In the northern part of the lake, dispersal predominantly occurs alongshore, mirroring the prevailing cyclonic (counterclockwise) coastal circulation during the stratified season. This pattern is a consequence of a 45% increase in upwelling events compared to three decades ago. In the northwestern and southern sectors of the lake, elevated cross-shore mixing is attributed to geomorphology-induced cross-basin currents.					; Valipour, Reza/AAZ-7695-2020	Madani, Mohammad/0000-0002-5847-8555; Hlevca, Bogdan/0000-0001-6636-4139													1932-6203					JAN 8	2025	20	1							e0298702	10.1371/journal.pone.0298702	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0298702								39775252					WOS:001392936300042

Modelling the influence of invasive mussels on phosphorus cycling in Lake Michigan	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Invasive dreissenid mussels have successfully established dense population at nearshore and mid-depth regions, and significantly altered the ecosystem and food web dynamics in Lake Michigan. In this work, we used a high resolution hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model to evaluate how these extensively colonized benthic mussels will affect the dynamics of phosphorus cycling In Lake Michigan. Model results demonstrated the important role of mussels in re-engineering of phosphorus cycling, with their filtering and excretion activities causing increasing lake-wide ratio of dissolved (DP) and particulate (PP) phosphorus. The diffusive flux at the bottom of mid-depth site was significantly enhanced compared to the sedimentation due to the benthic mussels, with an average effective flux 12.1 times greater than the passive setting, which was consistent with the field observations. Nearshore-offshore phosphorus transport displayed substantial spatial and temporal variabilities, and the nearshore was identified as an overall source/sink of PP/DP to the offshore region. The simulation results with mussels revealed that the mussel could effectively reduce the PP transport to the offshore region, potentially risking the pelagic fish abundance. This study provides key quantitative estimates for the impact of benthic mussels on vertical PP delivery and lake-wide nearshore offshore phosphorus transport, and could inform potential ecosystem management strategies of Lake Michigan and other dreissenid mussel invaded lakes.

However, this work is often complicated by a lack of detailed information on species distribution and habitat features and tends to ignore the impact of scale and landscape features. Here, we tracked 11 Oriental White Storks (Ciconia boyciana) with GPS loggers during their wintering period at Poyang Lake and divided the tracking data into two parts (foraging and roosting states) according to the distribution of activity over the course of a day. Then, a three-step multiscale and multistate approach was employed to model habitat selection characteristics: (1) first, we minimized the search range of the scale for these two states based on daily movement characteristics; (2) second, we identified the optimized scale of each candidate variable; and (3) third, we fit a multiscale, multivariable habitat selection model in relation to natural features, human disturbance and especially landscape composition and configuration. Our findings reveal that habitat selection of the storks varied with spatial scale and that these scaling relationships were not consistent across different habitat requirements (foraging or roosting) and environmental features. Landscape configuration was a more powerful predictor for storks' foraging habitat selection, while roosting was more sensitive to landscape composition. Incorporating high-precision spatiotemporal satellite tracking data and landscape features derived from satellite images from the same periods into a multiscale habitat selection model can greatly improve the understanding of species-environmental relationships and guide efficient recovery planning and legislation.</p>					Li, Jinya/N-2990-2014															2072-4292				NOV	2021	13	21							4397	10.3390/rs13214397	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13214397													WOS:000718475100001

The task of preventing and controlling winter ice damage in the Yellow River is severe, and it is significant to explore the applicability of different ice thickness estimation methods in this region. There is a lack of inversion studies on the thickness of the Yellow River ice. In this study, a typical reach of the Yellow River was selected as the research area. Based on the measured ice thickness data for many years, the applications of river ice thickness estimation models based on remote sensing and air temperature were explored respectively in this area. The results show that the VV polarized backscatter coefficient of Sentinel-1 SAR data has the highest correlation with the measured ice thickness, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.702. SAR ice thickness inversion results are helpful to identify ice jam location. The simulation accuracy of the air temperature model for ice thickness is better than that of the SAR model. Long-term air temperature-based ice thickness estimates show the maximum ice thickness in the study area is thinning at a rate of -0.7 cm a decade.					; Zhang, Yuan/AAX-6334-2021; luo, hongchun/LWH-7042-2024	Liu, Bin/0009-0004-9336-2816; Zhai, Yongguang/0000-0002-6241-6947													1939-1404	2151-1535					2023	16						5645	5659		10.1109/JSTARS.2023.3285229	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2023.3285229													WOS:001022072400003

Variation in native micro-predator abundance explains recruitment of a mobile invasive fish, the common carp, in a naturally unstable environment	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Why certain species of fish become invasive is poorly understood and a key obstacle to restoring many of the world's ecosystems. In this study we tested whether variation in biotic resistance exerted by native predators might explain the reproductive success of the common carp, a large and fecund invasive species that typically spawns in outlying and unstable shallow habitat. An initial three-year study of the relative abundance of young-of-year (YOY) carp in interconnected lakes in the Upper Mississippi River Basin discovered that YOY carp are only found in shallow waters that experience winter hypoxia (winterkill) and have low densities of the native egg-predators that otherwise dominate these locales. A follow-up experiment tested if native fish predation on carp eggs could explain this distribution. It found that while carp eggs survived in winterkill lakes, they only survived in non-winterkill lakes when protected by a mesh that excluded fish. Large numbers of carp eggs were found in the stomachs of native fish inhabiting lakes that did not winterkill. We conclude that common carp, and likely many other highly mobile and fecund invasive fish, have evolved life histories to avoid egg predators and can become invasive when they are absent.

During the last (Pinedale) glaciation, the northern Yellowstone outlet glacier flowed out of Yellowstone Park and down the Yellowstone River Valley into the Paradise Valley. The field trip will traverse the following Pinedale glacial sequence: (1) deposition of the Eightmile terminal moraines and outwash 16.5 +/- 1.4 Be-10 ka in the Paradise Valley; (2) glacial recession of similar to 8 km and deposition of the Chico moraines and outwash 16.1 +/- 1.7 Be-10 ka; (3) glacial recession of 45 km to near the northern Yellowstone boundary and moraine deposition during the Deckard Flats readjustment 14.2 +/- 1.2 Be-10 ka; and (4) glacial recession of similar to 37 km and deposition of the Junction Butte moraines 15.2 +/- 1.3 Be-10 ka (this age is a little too old based on the stratigraphic sequence). Yellowstone's northern range of sagebrush-grasslands and bison, elk, wolf, and bear inhabitants is founded on glacial moraines, sub-glacial till, and outwash deposited during the last glaciation. Floods released from glacially dammed lakes and a landslide-dammed lake punctuate this record. The glacial geologic reconstruction was evaluated by calculation of basal shear stress, and yielded the following values for flow pattern in plan view: strongly converging-1.21 +/- 0.12 bars (n = 15); nearly uniform-1.04 +/- 0.16 bars (n = 11); and strongly diverging-0.84 +/- 0.14 bars (n = 16). Reconstructed mass balance yielded accumulation and ablation each of similar to 3 km(3)/yr, with glacial movement near the equilibrium line altitude dominated by basal sliding. Pollen and charcoal records from three lakes in northern Yellowstone provide information on the postglacial vegetation and fire history. Following glacial retreat, sparsely vegetated landscapes were colonized first by spruce parkland and then by closed subalpine forests. Regional fire activity increased significantly with the development of closed subalpine forests as a result of increased fuel biomass and warmer summers. Warm dry conditions prevailed at low elevations during the early Holocene, as indicated by the presence of steppe and open mixed conifer forest. At the same time, closed subalpine forests with low fire frequency were present at higher elevations, suggesting relatively wet summer conditions. Douglas fir populations expanded throughout northern Yellowstone in the middle Holocene as a result of effectively drier conditions than before, and a decline of mesophytic plant taxa during the late Holocene imply continued drying, even though fire frequency decreased in recent millennia.																			2333-0937		978-0-8137-0037-3				2014	37						189	203		10.1130/2014.0037(09)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2014.0037(09)	10.1130/9780813700373												WOS:000340463900010
J	Chen, J; Xie, P				Chen, J; Xie, P			Seasonal dynamics of the hepatotoxic microcystins in various organs of four freshwater bivalves from the large eutrophic Lake Taihu of subtropical China and the risk to human consumption	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY												So far, little is known on the distribution of hepatotoxic microcystin (MC) in various organs of bivalves, and there is no study on MC accumulation in bivalves from Chinese waters. Distribution pattern and seasonal dynamics of MC-LR, -YR and -RR in various organs (hepatopancreas, intestine, visceral mass, gill, foot, and rest) of four edible freshwater mussels (Anodonta woodiana, Hyriopsis cumingii, Cristaria plicata, and Lamprotula leai) were studied monthly during Oct. 2003-Sep. 2004 in Lake Taihu with toxic cyanobacterial blooms in the summer. Qualitative and quantitative determinations of MCs in the organs were done by LC-MS and HPLC. The major toxins were present in the hepatopancreas (45.5-55.4%), followed by visceral mass with substantial amount of gonad (27.6-35.5%), whereas gill and foot were the least (1.8-5.1%). The maximum MC contents in the hepatopancreas, intestine, visceral mass, gill, foot, and rest were 38.48, 20.65, 1.70, 0.64, 0.58, and 0.61 mu g/g DW, respectively. There were rather good positive correlation in MC contents between intestines and hepatopancreas of the four bivalves (r = 0.75-0.97, p < 0.05). There appeared to be positive correlations between the maximum MC content in the hepatopancreas and the delta C-13 (r = 0.919) or delta N-15 (r = 0.878) of the foot, indicating that the different MC content in the hepatopancreas might be due to different food ingestion. A glutathione (GSH) conjugate of MC-LR was also detected in the foot sample of C. plicata. Among the foot samples analyzed, 54% were above the provisional WHO tolerable daily intake (TDI) level, and the mean daily intakes from the four bivalves were 8-23.5 times the TDI value when the bivalves are eaten as a whole, suggesting the high risk of consuming bivalves in Lake Taihu.

J	Schmid, H; Bauer, F; Stich, HB				Schmid, H; Bauer, F; Stich, HB			Determination of algal biomass with HPLC pigment analysis from lakes of different trophic state in comparison to microscopically measured biomass	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method is presented with which a direct determination of the phytoplankton biomass is possible. By correlating over 100 samples investigated with HPLC as well as microscopically, it has been shown that phytoplankton biomass is described very accurately by determining the concentration of accessory pigments. In contrast to earlier studies, we made a direct correlation of marker pigments with biovolume and did not consider the ratio of marker pigment to chlorophyll a. Determination of the dominating class in each lake succeeded with correlation coefficients > 0.90, and even 0.96 against total biovolume. Because of the large number of samples, statistical proof indicates that algal marker pigments are better indicators for phytoplankton biomass than chlorophyll a. This HPLC method is ideal for large-scale monitoring because of its suitability for routine analysis and its extensive sample throughput. The procedure is applicable to different natural waters, from oligotrophic to highly eutrophic. Because of the simultaneously performed analysis of chlorophyll a, the succession of existing data is ensured.																			0142-7873					SEP	1998	20	9					1651	1661		10.1093/plankt/20.9.1651	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/20.9.1651													WOS:000076186400001
J	Yu, G; Ye, LT; Liu, ZY; Xue, B				Yu, Ge; Ye, Liangtao; Liu, Zhengyu; Xue, Bin			Interpreting the lake-status record of the East Asian monsoon using a hydrological model	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The East Asian monsoon (EAM) has experienced significant changes over the past 10,000 years that influenced East Asian agricultural development. However, the magnitude and extent of the EAM precipitation fluctuations at 6 ka remain unresolved, owing to uncertainty in individual lake records and substantial variations in the expansion limits in simulations of the mid-Holocene EAM precipitation. Here we present an approach based on multiple lake-level records using the "1D lake level-2D lake area-3D catchment hydrology" model to reconstruct the precipitation patterns in northern China, and to further quantify the extent of the EAM precipitation expansion in the mid-Holocene relative to today. The precipitation reconstructions suggest an similar to 550-1100 km northward expansion and an similar to 530-840 km westward migration of the EAM at 6 ka. At that time, the EAM precipitation domain covered over 6 million square kilometers. Thus, this approach mitigates the uncertainty and arbitrariness of reconstructions of the limit of the EAM precipitation fields and provides a benchmark for future climate modeling studies.

Scott; Heiri, Oliver; Perez-Martinez, Carmen			Ecosystem Responses to Climate-Related Changes in a Mediterranean Alpine Environment Over the Last ∼180Years	ECOSYSTEMS												The effect of recent climatic warming is significant in the Mediterranean region, especially in high-mountain areas. This study uses multiple sedimentary proxies from Rio Seco Lake, a remote alpine lake in the Sierra Nevada, southeastern Spain, to reconstruct recent environmental and ecological changes in the lake and catchment. Two main climatic periods can be distinguished during the past 180years: Period One (1820 to similar to 1920s) characterized by colder and wetter conditions than the more recent Period Two (similar to 1920s to the present), characterized by warmer and drier conditions. Independent proxies such as subfossil chironomid assemblages, n-alkane indices, pollen data and/or spectrally inferred chlorophyll-a concentrations indicate a longer ice-cover period, colder water temperature and more pronounced accumulation of snow in the catchment during Period One than in Period Two, likely producing water stress for catchment plant growth because of the low rate of ice melting in Period One. As temperature increases and precipitation decreases from the 1920s onwards, a wider development of wetland plants is observed, which is associated with the longer warm season that contributed to snow and ice melting in the catchment. This continuing temperature rise and precipitation decrease over the past 60-years by similar to 0.24 degrees C per decade and -0.92mm/y, respectively, lead to an important increase in chlorophyll-a and changes in lake biotic assemblages. Major chironomid community structure changes to warmer water taxa were recorded, resulting in a 2 degrees C increase in mean July air temperature inferred by chironomids from similar to 1950 onwards. An inferred increase in primary production for the past few decades is consistent with higher temperatures, while wider development of wetland plants is associated with longer warm season. The coherence between independent environmental proxies, each associated with distinct mechanistic linkages to climatic shifts, strengthens our interpretations of a recent warming trend and an intensification of summer drought in this high-mountain area leading to distinct changes in the lake and its catchment. The impact of this climate change on the summits of Sierra Nevada and its influence transcends its geographical limits because these systems provide ecosystem services to a vast area.

The evaluation was done on three furrows in each of the four farm plots. Field capacity, permanent wilting point and bulk density of the four plots were determined in the laboratory. We monitored furrow inflow rate, cutoff time and soil moisture content in the plots over a period of about 4 weeks.This monitoring was done during both periods of water availability and water scarcity. Our results show that on average 58% (range 42-77%) of the applied irrigation water in this scheme can be considered beneficial for crop growth. The results also show that soil moisture content at farm plots at the canal head sections was always between soil saturation level and permanent wilting point. For farm plots along the middle and tail sections of the main canal, soil water content would even fall below the permanent wilting point. This was caused by the absence of a water allocation system to ensure equity, and by large, channel seepage losses along the unlined main canal. To improve irrigation efficiency therefore, rehabilitation of the physical infrastructure of the scheme, more equitable irrigation water distribution in the scheme and improvement in on-farm irrigation water management are needed.

Growth-grazing differences increased with trophic conditions, averaging 0.08 for the water column in the meso-oligotrophic nothern bay and 0.56 in the eutrophic southern bay for the summers of 1986, 1987, and 1988. Eutrophic conditions produced dominance of growth by large-size cyanobacteria and low grazing rates by microcrustaceans. Small and occasionally negative growth-grazing differences in the meso-oligotrophic region were associated with dominance of larger cladocerans and calanoid copepods and small algal species. Phytoplankton growth rates in the northern bay averaged about 28% those of the eutrophic region. A unimodal phytoplankton growth response to increased grazing was observed in the northern bay, suggesting variation in positive (growth stimulating) and negative (grazing losses) effects of zooplankton on the phytoplankton.																			0706-652X					JAN	1991	48	1					116	122		10.1139/f91-016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f91-016													WOS:A1991ET78100016

High-resolution remote sensing, especially aerial datasets, offers valuable insights into current permafrost characteristics and thaw dynamics. Here, we present a new dataset of very high resolution orthomosaics, point clouds, and digital surface models that we acquired over permafrost landscapes in northwestern Canada and northern and northwestern Alaska for the purpose of better understanding the impacts of climate change on permafrost landscapes. The imagery was collected with the Modular Aerial Camera System (MACS) during aerial campaigns conducted by the Alfred Wegener Institute in the summers of 2018, 2019, and 2021. The MACS was specifically developed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) for operation under challenging light conditions in polar environments. It features cameras in the optical and the near-infrared wavelengths with up to a 16 MP resolution. We processed the images to four-band (blue-green-red-near-infrared) orthomosaics and digital surface models with spatial resolutions of 7 to 20 cm as well as 3D point clouds with point densities of up to 41 points m(-2). The dataset collection features 102 subprojects from 35 target regions (1.4-161.1 km(2) in size). Project sizes range from 4.8 to 336 GB. In total, 3.17 TB were published. The horizontal precision of the datasets is in the range of 1-2 px and vertical precision is better than 0.10 m. The datasets are not radiometrically calibrated. Overall, these very high resolution images and point clouds provide significant opportunities for mapping permafrost landforms and generating detailed training datasets for machine learning, can serve as a baseline for change detection for thermokarst and thermo-erosion processes, and help with upscaling of field measurements to lower-resolution satellite observations. The dataset is available on the PANGAEA repository at 10.1594/PANGAEA.961577.

The analyses show that high Sr concentration, high TOC content, high C/N ratio and enriched delta C-13 of lake sediments corresponded to stronger chemical weathering, high productivity, high lake level and warmer/wetter climate and vice versa. As revealed by the variations of these proxies, the climatic evolution during this period can be divided into five stages and several substages. These are a cold/dry stage before 10140 cal years BP, a transition stage from 10140 to 8560 cal years BP, an optimum stage (warm/wet) from 8560 to 5750 cal years BP, a cool/dry stage from 5750 to 4000 cal years BP, a transition stage from 4000 to 3000 cal years BP and a drying-up stage after 3000 cal years BP. These changes are presumably reflections of variations in Indian monsoon intensity which, according to that interpretation, should have been enhanced from 8560 cal years BP, slightly weakened after 5750 cal years BP, and gradually diminished since 3000 cal years BP in this region.

J	Murchie, KJ; Power, M				Murchie, KJ; Power, M			Growth- and feeding-related isotopic dilution and enrichment patterns in young-of-the-year yellow perch (Perca flavescens)	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Isotopic signatures (delta(15)N and delta(13)C) from young-of-the-year (YOY) yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were collected over the initial 4 month summer growing period from three separate and distinctive sites in northern Alberta, Canada. Data were analysed to test the hypotheses that there are within- and among-population differences in the patterns of isotopic delta(15)N and delta(13)C change over the growing season, and that observed isotopic dilution and/or enrichment patterns were influenced by site-specific physical and chemical factors. 2. Increases in delta(15)N relative to spawned egg masses were observed in immediate posthatch (emergent) YOY and attributed to enrichment associated with the assimilation of yolk during embryonic development. 3. Posthatch dilution of YOY delta(15)N signatures associated with ontogenetic dietary shifts from yolk to exogenous feeding and zooplanktivory to benthivory occurred at all sites and was associated at most sites with a concomitant increase in delta(13)C. 4. The rate and pattern of delta(15)N dilution and delta(13)C enrichment observed for the study populations varied between and within sites and depended on maternal trophic status and timing of ontogenetic dietary shifts, as determined by prey availability and site-specific biogeochemical factors. 5. Comparisons of isotopic dilution patterns among species, using results from this study and literature-derived values, indicated that dilution rates and patterns are species dependent and may vary in relation to key life-history events. 6. Seasonal and spatial isotopic variability among populations and between species complicates field sampling. In particular, the connectivity to site-specific conditions found here suggests that for locally resident juvenile fishes, spatial, as well as temporal variability must be included in isotopic sampling programmes designed to characterise littoral zone foodweb relationships.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				JAN	2004	49	1					41	54		10.1046/j.1365-2426.2003.01163.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2426.2003.01163.x													WOS:000187405500004

Members of Tetralycosa are halotolerant, exclusively inhabiting saline environments such as coastal beaches, and mound springs, clay pans and salt lakes in the Australian interior. A phylogenetic analysis of the genus identified a monophyletic clade of eight species that live permanently on the barren surface of salt lakes suggesting a single radiation into this extremely inhospitable habitat. Some of these Tetralycosa species are currently known from single salt lakes only and with increasing disturbances of these systems by mining, agriculture and recreational use, research effort should be increased to study their ecology and conservation status.

This study examines the synergistic impacts of these stressors on water quality dynamics and their implications for porpoise conservation from 2012 to 2020 which reveal significant seasonal hydrological fluctuations, with summer precipitation peaking at 288.67 mm and evaporation rates reaching 406.3 mm in 2020, intensifying ecological instability. Nutrient pollution emerged as a critical threat, with total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations escalating to 4.95 mg/L and 0.106 mg/L, respectively, indicating heightened eutrophication risks driven by agricultural runoff and urbanization. Strong correlations between TN and TP (r = 0.289-0.472) highlight interconnected pollution pathways, while trace element bioaccumulation in porpoise tissues notably arsenic in blubber (0.8 mg/kg) and cadmium in kidneys (1.0 mg/kg) exceeded marine mammal toxicity thresholds, posing significant health risks. These findings underscore how climate-altered hydrology exacerbates contaminant mobilization, creating compound stressors for this endangered cetacean. We propose integrated strategies for nutrient reduction creating thermal refuge and pollution controls to support Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This multidisciplinary framework advances freshwater ecosystem resilience in an era of concurrent climatic and anthropogenic pressures, offering actionable insights for global biodiversity conservation.

High levels of genetic structure in the Australian freshwater fish, Ambassis macleayi	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												The genetic structure of the freshwater fish Ambassis macleayi Castelnau 1878 was explored across the tropical catchments of the Gulf of Carpentaria Basin, northern Australia. The Gulf of Carpentaria provides a unique opportunity to explore simultaneously contemporary and historical gene flow resulting from unique climatic patterns and historical connectivity among catchments via a freshwater lake that existed during lower sea levels. The control region of the mtDNA genome and 4 microsatellite loci were used to detect significant genetic structure among and within catchments. Within catchments, genetic structure suggested that dispersal of A. macleayi is restricted, despite high levels of connectivity during summer monsoonal events. Among catchments, divergence appeared to be deeper than what would be predicted based on the last opportunity for connectivity via the lake of Carpentaria (similar to 10,000 years before present [ybp]). Overall, these results have important implications for A. macleayi and other members of this genus. If individuals are not proficient dispersers, recolonization after disturbance will be limited. Because of historical isolation among catchments, each catchment harbors unique genetic diversity that should be conserved independently.					; hughes, jane/C-5321-2008	Huey, Joel/0000-0001-7108-0552; Baker, Andrew/0000-0001-8825-1522; 													0887-3593					SEP	2010	29	3					1148	1160		10.1899/09-093.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1899/09-093.1													WOS:000280692400029
J	GEHRKEN, U				GEHRKEN, U			DIAPAUSE TERMINATION IN EGGS OF THE STONEFLY ARCYNOPTERYX-COMPACTA (MCLACHLAND) IN RELATION TO DEHYDRATION AND COLD HARDINESS	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY												In the alpine regions of Southern Norway, eggs of the stonefly Arcynopteryx compacta are oviposited in small streams and lake outlets. During ice enclosure, eggs avoid freezing by supercooling and lose about two-thirds of their water content by shrinkage due to osmotic outflux of body water. The eggs enter diapause in autumn at an early stage of embryogenesis. The termination of diapause in 50-55% of eggs kept at 3.degree. C for 3 or 6 months, arises from the effect of chilling on diapause development. The dehydration, however, serves as a diapause-terminating cue. For water contents down to 41%, the termination of diapause seems directly correlated with the degree of dehydration. Treatments with juvenile hormone were also effective in terminating diapause. The termination may therefore be linked to a temporary elevation in juvenile hormone titre by dehydration. Fully hydrated eggs supercool to about -26.5.degree. C, and withstand ice enclosure for 3 days at -22.degree. C. The elevation of supercooling point, water content and depletion of thermal hysteresis-producing proteins correspond with the initiation of postdiapause development. Also ice-enclosure for 3 days at -15 and -18.degree. C proved fatal at this embryonic stage. The loss of cold hardiness could not be related to termination of diapause per se. Eggs remained cold hardy at 3.degree. C as long as the postdiapause development was prevented during the thermally controlled quiescence. The physiological and biochemical mechanisms which underlie adaptation to cold, however, are specific for an early stage of embryogenesis.																			0022-1910	1879-1611					1989	35	5					377	385		10.1016/0022-1910(89)90111-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1910(89)90111-X													WOS:A1989U552300004
J	INGRAM, TI				INGRAM, TI			A PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION INTO THE BACTERIOLOGICAL WATER-QUALITY PROBLEMS OF STONELICK-LAKE-STATE-PARK, OHIO	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH												Fecal coliform bacteria present in lake bathing waters pose a health problem to exposed individuals. Stonelick Lake State Park, located in Clermont County, Ohio, experienced high levels of fecal coliform bacteria in its bathing waters during the summer of 1990. An advisory was posted when the fecal coliform bacteria levels reached a geometric mean greater than 200 colonies per 100 milliliters. Stonelick Lake was impounded in the early 1950s. Sources of fecal coliform pollution in the 14,242-acre watershed include malfunctioning on-site sewage systems, livestock operations and the park's wastewater lagoon. The Clermont County General Health District initiated weekly sampling of the lake and its tributaries. Regression analyses showed correlations between the bathing water and inflow from two major tributaries (r=. 72) and between the bathing water and the park's wastewater lagoon (r=.80). Recommendations to abate the pollution include repair of the park's wastewater lagoon and malfunctioning on-site septic systems, and better management of livestock waste and soil erosion.																			0022-0892					APR	1993	55	6					19	23																WOS:A1993KW39800005

Influence of prey condition and incubation method on mortality, growth and metabolic rate during early life history in lake sturgeon,Acipenser fulvescens	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												Environmental conditions during early life can have a profound impact on developmental trajectory and ultimately ecological fitness of individuals. Therefore, from a conservation perspective it is vital to understand the longer-term implications of early phenotypic development on survival. In this study, we examined the effects of temperature (maintained at 16 degrees C or ambient river temperature), prey condition (live or dead Artemia) and incubation method (tumbling jar or natural hatching over substrate) on the routine or standard metabolic rate (RMR, SMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR), factorial aerobic scope, energy density (ED), whole body triglyceride concentration (TG), growth and mortality rate of age-0 lake sturgeon. Our results demonstrated that fish fed live artemia had significantly lower ED, growth and high mortality rates than those fed dead artemia at 32 days post-fertilisation (dpf) (p < .001). However, at 133 dpf fish fed live artemia showed higher MMR and no difference in ED, TG and growth rate compared to those fed dead prey during early life history. The present study showed that inclusion of live prey at the onset of exogenous feeding may be considered to promote a more natural phenotypic development in larval lake sturgeon.					; Yoon, Gwangseok/AAH-4714-2021	Yoon, Gwangseok/0000-0001-5557-8692; 													0175-8659	1439-0426				DEC	2020	36	6					759	767		10.1111/jai.14115	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jai.14115		SEP 2020											WOS:000573339700001

Effects of River Capture and Sediment Flux on the Evolution of Plateaus: Insights From Numerical Modeling and River Profile Analysis in the Upper Blue Nile Catchment	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												The Ethiopian Highlands, with up to 1,500-m-deep canyons surrounded by low relief plateau surfaces, are one of the most spectacular examples of transient fluvial landscapes on Earth. We analyze river profiles extracted from a 90m digital elevation model of the upper Blue Nile catchment and identify 116 major knickpoints on 137 river profiles. We use 1-D river profile models to simulate three potential mechanisms for knickpoint formation: plateau uplift, capture of large lakes or internal drainage on the plateau surface, and sediment-flux-dependent river incision with a low sediment flux from the plateau surface. We define a normalized upstream knickpoint propagation distance, (kpj), and demonstrate that the erosion models predict different distributions of this metric in transient profiles following plateau uplift. Model knickpoints resulting from the scenario of plateau uplift or common base-level fall using the stream-power model display similar upstream propagation distance in space. The results of the same scenario modeled with the sediment-flux-dependent incision model show upstream knickpoint propagation distance proportional to catchment area. Perturbations to these trends result from drainage capture. Comparing the model results with observed (kpj) values of knickpoints and field observations, we recognize effects characteristic of the sediment-flux-dependent incision model. However, most profiles are best explained by the systematic transfer of drainage area from the plateau to the surrounding rivers. We propose a new model of landscape evolution for the upper Blue Nile catchment dominated by discrete events of capture of drainage area from the plateau.

These datasets play an important role in developing countries. This study evaluated two reanalyses, CMORPH and SM2RAIN-ASCAT over Maharlu Lake, a semi-arid region in Iran. The results showed that these two near-time datasets do not have accurate data over this basin. However, the probability of detection (POD), critical success index (CSI), and false alarm ratio (FAR) statistics showed acceptable accuracy in the detection of precipitation. The coefficient of determination and root mean square error statistics have unacceptable accuracy over this area. The monthly changes in each of the indices showed that the CMORPH database had more errors in the spring months, but in other months the error rate was improved. SM2RAIN-ASCAT had better accuracy over this area relative to CMORPH. The estimation of the total accuracy of the data showed that these two satellite databases were not capable of estimating precipitation in the area.

J	Zhao, C; Li, XQ; Zhou, XY; Zhao, KL; Yang, Q				Zhao Chao; Li XiaoQiang; Zhou XinYing; Zhao KeLiang; Yang Qing			Holocene vegetation succession and responses to climate change in the northern sector of Northeast China	SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES												Sediment pollen samples from the Huola Basin in the northern sector of northeast China, and surface pollen samples from its environs, were analyzed to reconstruct accurately the historical response of vegetation to climate change since 9100 cal yr BP. Pollen analysis of the Huola Section indicates that vegetation experienced a transformation from early-mid Holocene warm-cold mixed vegetation to late Holocene cold-temperate vegetation. From 9100 to 6000 cal yr BP, the study area was warmer and moister than at present, developing Corylus, Carpinus, Pinus, Picea, Betula and Larix-dominated forests. Two cooling events at 6000-5000 and 3500-2500 cal yr BP led to a decrease in Corylus, Carpinus and other warmth-loving vegetation, whereas cold temperate forests composed of Larix and Betula expanded. After 2500 cal yr BP, Larix and Betula dominated cold-temperate vegetated landscapes. The Holocene warm period in NE China (9100-6000 cal yr BP) suggests that such warming could have resulted in a strengthening of the influence from East Asian Summer Monsoon on northernmost NE China and would have benefited the development of warm-temperate forest vegetation and an improved plant load, which also provides the similarity model for the possible global warming in the future.

Compound-specific carbon isotope records for the vascular plant leaf wax hydrocarbons, the C-23-C-33 n-alkanes, and for the algal hydrocarbons, the C-23 and C-25 n-alkenes and a C-30 cyclobotryococcatriene, all show a shift of circa +3parts per thousand in delta C-13 values from MIS 3 to the end of MIS 2, followed by a rapid return to lighter values. This shift (from -32 to -29parts per thousand) for the n-alkanes and n-alkenes most likely derives from bicarbonate utilization by aquatic plants in the lake, rather than increased C-4 photosynthesis. Thus, both pollen data and hydrocarbon data appear to reveal a rise and fall in the contributions of submerged and/or floating plants during MIS 2. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We estimated mean summer concentrations of several trophic level indicators including piscivores, planktivores, zooplankton, phytoplankton, and total phosphorus, and we then investigated the relationships between these variables. Both data sets yielded similar long-term and short-term trends. The long-term mean annual trends were that (1) the relationships between concentrations of planktivores and zooplankton (including daphnids) were always negative, (2) the relationships between concentrations of zooplankton and various measures of phytoplankton abundance were unpredictable and never statistically significant, and (3) the relationships between total phosphorus and various measures of phytoplankton abundance were always positive. Over short periods, the data from both lakes showed periodic, strong top-down relationships between concentrations of zooplankton (especially large Daphnia) and chlorophyll a, but these events were unpredictable and were seldom related to piscivore abundance.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				AUG	1992	49	8					1588	1596		10.1139/f92-177	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f92-177													WOS:A1992JP08800009

A single filtration at 1 pore size did not separate all heterotrophic microorganisms from photosynthetic algae. It was possible to calculate microbial assimilation of PDOC if filters of several pore sizes were used simultaneously in combination with an independent estimate of heterotrophic activity in each size class. Microbial net assimilation of algal PDOC in the epilimnion in summer (about 2 .mu.g C.cntdot.l-1.cntdot.day) was of a magnitude comparable to that of total bacterial production (4-8 .mu.g.cntdot.l-1.cntdot.day) as estimated by the 35SO4 technique. This comparison suggests that PDOC is an important source of C for planktonic microbes. The amount of PDOC measured in the water is smaller than the amount actually released by phytoplankton because microbes metabolize PDOC rapidly. Failure to account for microbial utilization could lead to a serious underestimate of gross PDOC during measurements of primary production.

A series of settling column tests (SCT) was carried out on the raw water taken from two influents of the lake to evaluate the sedimentation efficiency and P removal using two types of settling tests, discrete particle sedimentation (DPS) and flocculent particle sedimentation (FPS). In particular, the variation in the PSD and the P removal efficiency was traced to determine the impact of rain on the P treatment characteristics for three periods: the summer rainy period and before and after the rainy season. The PSD of the trapped sediments had increased in the rainy season, with a decrease after the rainy season. Based on the SCT results of the suspended solids, a longer sedimentation time for the DPS in the dry season was required than in the rainy season, whereas the sedimentation times for the FPS were not much different for the three periods. However, the clarifying velocity of the total phosphorus concentration was slower than the suspended solid concentration for both DPS and FPS, which suggest the particles containing phosphorus settled much more slowly than typical particles in both tests. The findings of this study will be important information in determining whether to add a coagulation process in the design of a sedimentation basin for the removal of phosphorus to be constructed for eutrophication and removal of lakes.

The terminal Huangqihai Lake is located at the northern margin of the modern East Asian summer monsoon and sensitive to climate change. We present here a sedimentary section from Huangqihai lake basin which comprises lacustrine and fluvial deposits and is about 8-9 m above the present lake level. Quartz optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating was employed to construct the chronology of the section. Based on the OSL chronology and the sedimentological and granulometric analysis, we conclude that (1) the Huangqihai Lake experienced a humid climate during the early part of the Holocene (from c. 10.2 +/- 1.0 to 6.7 +/- 0.7 ka) with a persistent and stable high lake level; (2) the lake level began to decline indicating aridification between 8.7 +/- 0.8 ka and 6.7 +/- 0.7 ka, and the climate was drier and deteriorating, and the lake was turned into a playa for most of the time. In summary, the climate showed a general drying trend from the early Holocene to the late Holocene.

J	Kirtsideli, IY				Kirtsideli, IY			Changes in micromycetes' communities under shifts of environmental conditions in some soils of the Levinson-Lessing lake region (Taimyr peninsula)	MIKOLOGIYA I FITOPATOLOGIYA												Micromycete communities in some plant cenosess of Taimyr peninsula tundras were investigated at different vegetation periods. Our study of micromycetes in vicinity of the Levinsson-Lessin lake demonstrated that extreme environmental conditions lead to the low CFU values and declining in species diversity of soil micromycetes. This result in increased similarity of the micromycete complexes in various plant coenosess because of the restricted numbers of fungal species that form them. Changes in plant communities cause the structural variations of the fungal complexes but do not influence typical species composition. Only variations in random species composition can be detected. Differences in microlandscape characters are responsible for essential variation in numbers but not in content of soil micromycete complexes. Increasing temperature in spring and subsequent phenological changes lead to increase in micromycete activity but again not the CFU numbers. Quantitative dynamics of fungal species seem to depend bn their life strategies in soil, while temporary variations in species content in soil were not observed in each particular community. Only fluctuations in numbers of concrete species were observed.					kirtsideli, irina/J-7830-2013														0026-3648						1999	33	3					179	187																WOS:000082159100006

The conditions of growth involved a gradient of shading. As an analysis of the debris revealed a low pH, the soil in all pots was kept at a pH of 5.5. The best growing seedlings were in the most shaded areas in pots filled with plant debris and the worst growth was in sandy soil in full sunlight. We have measured the concentration of phenolic compounds, which was found to be highest in dying plants in sandy soils in full sunlight, and lowest in shaded areas in pots filled with debris.																									2000	267						230	233																WOS:000088358100050

The general three-element structure of loose cover in the glacial valley of Engteri Creek was established: moraine occurs in the lower part; proluvial deposits, in the middle; and covering deluvial deposits, on top. The sequence of postglacial evolution of slope processes was revealed. In the Atlantic (7245-5895years ago), proluvial flows were the most active: they reached far beyond the slopes and covered moraine. Later, in the Subboreal, surface erosion intensified. The sedimentation rates in Dzhul'etta Lake were calculated. The glacial peak revealed in bottom sediments falls into the period of 19 410-13 880 years ago, with the smallest sedimentation rate, 6.3 cm/1000 years, which is lower compared to the underlying and overlying layers by a factor of two to three.																			1028-334X	1531-8354				DEC	2018	483	1					1458	1462		10.1134/S1028334X18110077	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1028334X18110077													WOS:000453745300019

Based on the field work of investigation and referring to the literature concerned, the present study concludes that the Zhengjiashan landslide is of type I mechanical failure. The Zhengjiashan landslide is triggered by the forceful dynamic shock of the "5.12" Wenchuan Earthquake. Over 2 million cubes slid at high speed caused by shattered and tension rock mass shearing the leading edge of the locking-up area, and rushed the school and farmhouses in the leading-edge body, causing 33 deaths including 12 students, 2 teachers and 19 farmers. It was, then, blocked by the opposite mountain mass when entering into the Ziku River and formed a barrier lake after the concussion and accumulation. The landslip is a typical earthquake-triggered tension-shearing landslide, characterized by high-speed slide-falling with strong dynamic force that can grow into smooth slide bed near the causative fault and bedding fault.

The sedimentary facies change from the lacustrine Kalimati Formation to the deltaic Sunakothi Formation in the southern and central Kathmandu basin, and the abrupt and prominent increase of phytoliths Bambusoideae and Pediastrum, and contemporaneous decrease of sponge spicule and charcoal grains around 48 and 38 ka support the lowering of water level at these times. According to the pollen analysis, both events occurred under rather warm and wet climate, thus supporting that they were triggered by tectonic cause and not by climate change. The first event might be linked to a possible occurrence of a large earthquake with an epicenter in the vicinity of the Paleo-Kathmandu Lake. The occurrence of a mega landslide in Langtang area close to the north of the Kathmandu Valley producing pseudotachylite dated at 51 +/- 13 ka could be linked to this earthquake. Finally, the water was completely drained out from the remnant lake at the central part of the Kathmandu basin by ca. 12 ka.																			1880-5981					FEB 27	2016	68								31	10.1186/s40623-016-0413-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40623-016-0413-5													WOS:000370938100001

Mean diel variability of surface energy fluxes over Manso Reservoir	INLAND WATERS												Mean diel cycle of latent (E), sensible (H), net longwave (Lw(net)), net shortwave (S-w), and net surface heat flux balance (S) were estimated from hourly meteorological and subsurface water temperature time series acquired for similar to 1 month during mid-austral autumn by a buoy system in a large tropical reservoir in Brazil. E and H were in phase and had their maximum (E = 163 Wm(-2); H = 39 Wm(-2)) at early morning and minimum (E = 112 Wm(-2); H = 6 Wm(-2)) midafter-noon, resulting in Bowen ratios of 0.24 and 0.06, respectively. Heat loss by evaporation therefore dominates over sensible heat used to warm surface atmosphere. Atmospheric instability was present almost all the time, increasing latent and sensible heat flux exchange coefficients by similar to 50% over their neutral values (from 1.4 x 10(-3) to 2.2 x 10(-3)). Mean Lwnet varied from 76 at late afternoon to 89 Wm(-2) at early morning, indicating its importance in the overall surface heat flux balance. All 3 fluxes (E, H, and Lw(net)) were positive (reservoir losing energy) throughout the day. The integrated daily average net energy budget S (net short wave radiation minus E+H+Lw(net)) was similar to-60 Wm(-2); nighttime energy loss exceeded daytime gain, with consequent cooling of the reservoir. A mean temperature drop of about -0.1 degrees C d(-1) was obtained by fitting a linear trend line to observed daily mean surface temperatures. In a qualitative way, diel time variations of surface water temperature were consistent to the time variability of S, indicating the dominant role of the surface heat budget in modulating surface layer temperatures of the reservoir.

Bernhart			The geological history of Geysir, Iceland: a tephrochronological approach to the dating of sinter	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY												The vertical succession through the discharge apron of Geysir, up to 3.5 m thick, is formed of five lithological units, A-E. Units A, B, C, and E are formed of siliceous sinters whereas Unit D is a brown ash bed. Tephra grains in units C, D, and E came from Katla, Hekla, and Veioivotn. Katla tephra in Unit D has been largely altered to palagonite. Integration of tephrochronological ages, historical records, and geological and geomorphological relationships shows that the Geysir succession developed in four main phases. During Phase I, c. 10 000-4000 years ago, laminated sinters formed from hot spring waters. Phase II, initiated c. 3300 years ago, saw the termination of sinter formation and blanketing of the area with tephra from Katla and Hekla. Phase III, c. 3000-900 years ago, represented by the boundary between units D and E, was characterized by weathering and little sinter deposition. Phase IV was initiated with the (re)birth of Geysir 800-900 years ago. Sinter deposited from the discharged waters has, however, been largely confined to the southern part of the discharge apron. Only limited opal-A precipitation has occurred since 1916 because of a decline in Geysir's eruptions.

Encompassing two lakes, the transboundary Prespa basin is covered by three Ramsar sites. The lakes host significant endemism and internationally important breeding and wintering waterbirds. For over 30 years, the Society for the Protection of Prespa (SPP), a locally based NGO representing an international constituency, has successfully used the obligations, goals and objectives laid out by the Ramsar Convention. The SPP has led broader alliances, implementing and coordinating conservation action, initially on the Greek side and later at basin level, through an integrated ecosystem approach, multiparticipatory decision-making processes and transboundary collaboration. It has achieved substantial benefits for waterbird populations, especially pelicans, engaged in community-based resource management approaches and drawn support, mainly from international donors, to achieve progress in the wise use of the wetland. The established decision-making mechanisms in Greek Prespa, the long-term monitoring data on the wetland ecosystem and the operation of transboundary collaboration networks are also expected to contribute towards addressing ongoing challenges, such as eutrophication and adaptation to climate change.

Nutrient capture in an Iowa farm pond: Insights from high-frequency observations	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Shallow constructed ponds are abundant landscape features in the midwestern United States, suggested as an edge of field best management practice (BMP) in voluntary nutrient reduction strategies. The efficacy of such features is highly uncertain, however, and previous studies have lacked sufficient temporal resolution to determine N and P removals during critical periods of transport. We utilized high-frequency in-situ measurements and flow-weighted grab sampling to determine water and nutrient budgets for a typical constructed "farm pond" in central Iowa situated within the Iowa Southern Drift Plain. Our monitoring approach yielded insight into in-stream nitrogen processing and the relative importance of transport-vs. supply-limited N delivery. Diel patterns in NO3-N observed during early Spring, prior to canopy closure, revealed that in-stream primary production and NO3-N assimilation can influence downstream N delivery in a stream with nitrate pollution (mean annual NO3-N of nearly 5 mg/L). Analysis of discharge-concentration hysteresis for NO3-N showed a shift from transport to supply limitation for NO3-N delivery over the growing season, influenced by antecedent moisture, with wet antecedent conditions leading to supply limitation. Significant NO3-N removal (64% of 19.8 kg/ha inputs) occurred within the 4.2 ha pond (230 ha watershed), but total N removal was much lower (36% removal of 22.3 kg/ha inputs). The lower total N removal highlights the importance of both particulate N and dissolved organic N and ammonia export to the N budgets of hypereutrophic small ponds. Total P removal in the pond was only 8% of 2.3 kg/ha inputs, likely due to internal loading of recent and legacy sedimentary P within the pond. High-flow events dominated N and P inputs, during which removal efficacy of the pond was significantly diminished. Poor process performance during critical moments may partially explain lower than expected water quality improvements post-BMP implementation. Accordingly, shifting hydroclimatic regimes (e.g., frequency of intense rainfall events) will impact the efficacy of small ponds and other edge of field BMPs for nutrient reduction.

A biophysical model of Lake Erie walleye (Sander vitreus) explains interannual variations in recruitment	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We used a three-dimensional coupled hydrodynamic-ecological model to investigate how lake currents can affect walleye (Sander vitreus) recruitment in western Lake Erie. Four years were selected based on a fall recruitment index: two high recruitment years (i.e., 1996 and 1999) and two low recruitment years (i.e., 1995 and 1998). During the low recruitment years, the model predicted that (i) walleye spawning grounds experienced destructive bottom currents capable of dislodging eggs from suitable habitats (reefs) to unsuitable habitats (i. e., muddy bottom), and (ii) the majority of newly hatched larvae were transported away from the known suitable nursery grounds at the start of their first feeding. Conversely, during two high recruitment years, predicted bottom currents at the spawning grounds were relatively weak, and the predicted movement of newly hatched larvae was toward suitable nursery grounds. Thus, low disturbance-based egg mortality and a temporal and spatial match between walleye first feeding larvae and their food resources were predicted for the two high recruitment years, and high egg mortality plus a mismatch of larvae with their food resources was predicted for the two low recruitment years. In general, mild westerly or southwesterly winds during the spawning-nursery period should favour walleye recruitment in the lake.					; Shuter, Brian/A-3991-2008	Roseman, Edward/0000-0002-5315-9838; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				JAN	2009	66	1					114	125		10.1139/F08-188	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F08-188													WOS:000264957200011

A comprehensive understanding of internal feedback mechanisms is crucial for regulating nutrients in these lakes. A five-year study was conducted on the diatom community and environment in Lake Fuxian, China's largest deep freshwater lake, which is becoming eutrophic. The results indicate a shift in the diatom community from a stable state dominated by a single species to a rapid seasonal fluctuation, and there is a significant increase in diatom biomass. Specifically, stable stratification and low nutrient concentrations are limiting the growth of diatom biomass and maintaining the dominance of Cyclotella. Nutrients in the hypolimnion were replenished in the epilimnion during the extreme cold of winter, triggering a shift in the diatom community. This shift may imply that future climate change will exacerbate the positive feedback of hypoxia-nutrient release of algal blooms, potentially triggering a regime shift in the ecosystem of the entire lake. This study underscores the fact that climate change alters the internal feedback mechanisms of deep lakes, reducing ecosystem stability, and provides a scientific basis for further clarification of protection measures for deep lakes. Our study analyzed a five-year ecological transition in a deep lake by seasonal sampling, which used diatoms as indicators. The study found that long-term warming and occasional extreme events profoundly altered the internal recycling mechanisms of the deep lake, which ultimately led to plankton community proliferation and regime shifts. The results suggest that future climate change may trigger dramatic regime shifts across more and more deep lakes at a global level, whose ecological security is under serious threat.image					zhu, kexin/KUF-3366-2024; Xing, Peng/E-9238-2016; Zhao, Yu/GXZ-9087-2022	Zhao, Yu/0000-0001-5443-9324; 													2045-7758					JUL	2024	14	7							e70052	10.1002/ece3.70052	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.70052								39050663					WOS:001275106500001

Chironomid record of Late Quaternary climatic and environmental changes from two sites in Central Asia (Tuva Republic, Russia) - local, regional or global causes?	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Sediment cores from two mountain lakes (Lake Grusha at 2413 m a.s.l. and Ak-Khol at 2204 m a.s.l.) situated in the Tuva Republic (southern Siberia, Russia), just north of Mongolia, were studied for chironomid fossils in order to infer post-glacial climatic changes and to investigate responses of the lake ecosystems to these changes. The results show that chironomids are responding both to temperature and to changing lake depth, which is regarded as a sensitive proxy of regional effective moisture. The post-glacial history of this mountain region in Central Asia can be divided into seven successive climatic phases: the progressive warming during the last glacial-interglacial transition (ca 15.8-14.6 cal kyr BP), the warm and moist Bolling-Allerod-like interval (ca 14.6-13.1 cal kyr BP), the cool and dry Younger Dryas-like event (ca 13.1-12.1 cal kyr BP), warmer and wetter conditions during ca 12.1-8.5 cal kyr BP, a warm and dry phase ca 8.5-5.9 cal kyr BP, cold and wet conditions during ca 5.9-1.8 cal kyr BP, as well as cold and dry climate within the last 1800 years. The chironomid records reveal patterns of climatic variability during the Late-glacial and Holocene, which can be correlated with abrupt climatic events in the North Atlantic and the Asian monsoon-dominated regimes. Apparently, the water balance of the studied lakes is controlled by the interrelation between the dominant westerly system and the changing influence of the summer monsoon, as well as the influence of alpine glacier meltwater supply. It is possible that monsoon tracks could have reached the southwest Tuva, resulting in an increase in precipitation at ca 14.6-13.1 and ca 12.1-8.5cal kyr BP, whereas cyclonic westerlies from the North Atlantic were likely responsible for considerable moisture transport accompanying the global Neoglacial cooling at ca 5.9-1.8 cal kyr BP. These events suggest the changes of the regional pattern of atmospheric circulation, which could be in turn induced by the global climatic shifts. Some discrepancies compared with other reconstructions from Central Asia may be associated with regional (spatial) differences between the changing predominant circulation mechanisms and with local differences in uplift and descent of air masses within the complicated mountain landscape. In this paper, we also discuss the possibilities and perspectives for using chironomids in reconstructions of past temperatures and climate-induced changes in water depth of lakes in Central Asia.

A new genus of small amnicoline snails, Colligyrus, is proposed for Hydrobia greggi Pilsbry, 1935, together with a new species from the Harney Lake basin of Oregon. This group is strongly differentiated from other amnicolines by a unique female genitalic groundplan. New records are provided for three species of Fluminicola, and two new congeners are described from the northwest Great Basin, both of which had previously been confused with F. turbiniformis (Tryon, 1865). A new genus of cochliopine snails, Eremopyrgus, is erected for a new species from Steptoe Valley, Nevada. Eremopyrgus is distinguished from other cochliopines by unique aspects of its glandular penial lobes and other genitalic features. New records are provided for two species of Tryonia, and a new congener is described from thermal springs in central Nevada Several new records of Pristinicola hemphilli (Pilsbry, 1890) from the extreme northwest Great Basin are provided.																			0042-3211					OCT 1	1999	42	4					306	337																WOS:000083040300002

Reservoirs in central Texas have been more recently invaded by zebra mussels and these populations represent the southernmost edge of this species' current distribution in North America. The purpose of this study was to examine the distribution and population dynamics (recruitment and mortality) of zebra mussels in Canyon Lake and the effect of high temperatures and low dissolved oxygen on mortality of zebra mussels in three different Central Texas lakes (Canyon, Belton, and Stillhouse Hollow). Recruitment, both larval densities and juvenile settlement, varied with temperature within and between years. The highest settlement rate and lower mortality were associated with lower temperatures (e.g., year or lake with lowest number of days >= 30 degrees C), whereas hypoxia likely caused high mortality at greater depths in Lake Belton. Although higher summer temperatures seem to limit zebra mussels, their population has continued to increase and expand in Canyon Lake since the initial invasion, but at considerably lower densities than higher latitude populations This study improves our understanding of factors driving and limiting zebra mussel population dynamics in low latitude lakes, which will help to inform management decisions.

The empirical relationship between nutrient loading (total phosphorus) and phytoplankton standing stock (chlorophyll a) in lakes was described about 30 years ago(3) and is central for managing surface water quality. The efficiency with which biomass and energy are transferred through the food web and sustain the production of higher trophic levels (such as fish) declines with nutrient loading and system productivity(4,5), but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we show that in seston (fine particles in water) during summer, specific omega3-polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega3-PUFAs), which are important for zooplankton(6-10), are significantly correlated to the trophic status of the lake. The omega3-PUFAs octadecatetraenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid, but not alpha-linolenic acid, decrease on a double-logarithmic scale with increasing total phosphorus. By combining the empirical relationship between EPA-to-carbon content and total phosphorus with functional models relating EPA-to-carbon content to the growth and egg production of daphnids(8), we predict secondary production for this key consumer. Thus, the decreasing efficiency in energy transfer with increasing lake productivity can be explained by differences in omega3-PUFA-associated food quality at the plant-animal interface.					; Brett, Michael/A-2066-2010	Park, Sangkyu/0000-0003-3049-0728; Brett, Michael/0000-0002-8796-9863; 													0028-0836					JAN 1	2004	427	6969					69	72		10.1038/nature02210	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature02210								14702086					WOS:000187710000035

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY												Three strains of facultatively aerobic, moderately thermophilic bacteria were isolated from terrestrial hot springs in Baikal Lake region and Kamchatka (Russia). Cells of the new isolates were cocci reproducing by binary fission. The temperature range for growth was between 20 and 56 degrees C and the pH range for growth from pH 4.5 to 8.5, with optimal growth at 47-50 degrees C and pH 7.0-7.5. The organisms were chemoheterotrophs preferring sugars and polysaccharides as growth substrates. 168 rRNA gene sequences of strains 2842, 2813 and 2918Kr were nearly identical (99.7-100% similarity) and indicated that the strains belonged to the phylum Planctomycetes. The phylogenetically closest cultivated relatives were Algisphaera agarilytica 06SJR6-2(T). and Phycisphaera mikurensis FYK2301M01(T) with 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values of 82.4 and 80.3%, respectively. The novel strains differed from them by higher growth temperature, sensitivity to NaCl concentration above 3.0% and by their cellular fatty acids profile. On the basis of phylogenetic and physiological data, strains 2842(T), 2813 and 2918Kr represent a novel genus and species for which we propose the name Tepidisphaera mucosa sp. nov. The type strain is 2842(T) (=VKM B-2832(T)=JCM 19875(T)).

A novel cross-satellite based assessment of the spatio-temporal development of a cyanobacterial hatinful algal bloom	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												As the frequency of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) become more common in recreational lakes and water supply reservoirs, demand for rapid detection and temporal monitoring will be imminent for effective management. The goal of this study was to demonstrate a novel and potentially operational cross satellite based protocol for synoptic monitoring of rapidly evolving and increasingly common CyanoHABs in inland waters. The analysis involved a novel way to cross-calibrate a chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) detection model for the Landsat-8 OLI sensor from the relationship between the normalized difference chlorophyll index and the floating algal index derived from Sentinel-2A on a coinciding overpass date during the summer CyanoHAB bloom in Utah Lake. This aided in the construction of a time-series phenology of the Utah Lake CyanoHAB event. Spatio-temporal cyanobacterial density maps from both Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 sensors revealed that the bloom started in the first week of July 2016 (July 3rd, mean cell count: 9163 cells/ma reached peak in mid July (July 15th, mean cell count: 108176 cells/ma and reduced in August (August 24th, mean cell count: 9145 cells/Ina Analysis of physical and meteorological factors suggested a complex interaction between landscape processes (high surface runoff), climatic conditions (high temperature, high rainfall followed by negligible rainfall, stable wind), and water quality (low water level, high Chl-a) which created a supportive environment for triggering these blooms in Utah Lake. This cross satellite based monitoring methods can be a great tool for regular monitoring and will reduce the budget cost for monitoring and predicting CyanoHABs in large lakes.					; Kumar, Abhishek/I-4691-2019; Mishra, Deepak/Q-1250-2018	kumar, abhishek/0000-0002-6022-3068; Page, Benjamin/0000-0002-9871-2406; Mishra, Deepak/0000-0001-8192-7681; Kumar, Abhishek/0000-0002-0956-1766													1569-8432	1872-826X				APR	2018	66						69	81		10.1016/j.jag.2017.11.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2017.11.003													WOS:000423650500007

Here we document the first longitudinal movement of this aquatic invader in the Allegheny River, Pennsylvania. During spring 2013 we collected samples from the tailrace of Kinzua Dam to the confluence of Oil Creek, Oil City Pennsylvania, a distance of 100 km. The spiny water flea was present along 24 km of the sampled reach, comprising from 10 to 30% of the total zooplankton assemblage. In addition we collected two species of Daphnia, the dominant taxon, and Leptodora kindtii. All three developmental stages of the spiny water flea were present in samples collected (Instars I, II, and III). This study presents one of the first documented expansions of this species from an impoundment to downstream riverine reaches. Its presence warrants further monitoring and appropriate strategies to curb its spread and to investigate its potential impact on the lotic food web.																			2242-1300					JUN	2014	3	2					89	95		10.3391/bir.2014.3.2.06	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/bir.2014.3.2.06													WOS:000372413900006

Antibodies Against Foot-and-mouth Disease (FMD) Virus in African Buffalos (Syncerus caffer) in Selected National Parks in Uganda (2001-2003)	TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES												P>In East Africa, the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus (FMDV) isolates have over time included serotypes O, A, C, Southern African Territories (SAT) 1 and SAT 2, mainly from livestock. SAT 3 has only been isolated in a few cases and only in African buffalos (Syncerus caffer). To investigate the presence of antibodies against FMDV serotypes in wildlife in Uganda, serological studies were performed on buffalo serum samples collected between 2001 and 2003. Thirty-eight samples from African buffalos collected from Lake Mburo, Kidepo Valley, Murchison Falls and Queen Elizabeth National Parks were screened using Ceditest (R) FMDV NS to detect antibodies against FMDV non-structural proteins (NSP). The seroprevalence of antibodies against non-structural proteins was 74%. To characterize FMDV antibodies, samples were selected and titrated using serotype-specific solid phase blocking enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISAs).

J	Li, MF; Li, YL				Li, Mengfan; Li, Yunliang			On the Hydrodynamic Behavior of the Changed River-Lake Relationship in a Large Floodplain System, Poyang Lake (China)	WATER												Poyang lake floodplains are hydrologically complex and dynamic systems which exhibit dramatic intra-annual wetting and drying. The flow regime of the Yangtze River was previously known to play an important role in affecting Poyang Lake and its extremely productive floodplains (river-lake relationship). The recent severe declines and recessions in the lake are closely linked to the changed river-lake relationship, resulting in significant hydrological, ecological, and economic problems. This study aims to examine the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the floodplain hydrodynamic behaviors with respect to impacts of the changed river-lake relationship, characterized by the lake water level, inundation area, and inundation duration based on a floodplain hydrodynamic model of Poyang Lake, and to further quantify the severity of dryness recently endured since 2000. Simulation results show that, in general, the current modified river-lake relationship is more likely to affect the hydrological seasonality of the floodplain system since 2000, relative to the flooding and drying cycles during past decades (1953-2000). The present hydrodynamic behaviors suffered significant change due to the greatest interference from the altered river-lake relationship, particularly for the falling period in October. On average, the floodplain water level and inundation duration decreased by 6 m and 12 days during October, respectively. Additionally, the highest monthly shrinkage rate in floodplain inundation shifted from the period of October-November to September-October, with the mean inundation area decreasing by around 50%, demonstrating an advanced and prolonged dry condition. The spatial responses of the hydrodynamics in the low-slope floodplains are most likely to be affected by the dynamic river-lake relationship, as expected. This study assessed the effects of the altered river-lake relationship on the hydrological regime of the Poyang Lake floodplains in terms of spatiotemporal distributions and changing processes for the periodic inundated behavior, which can support the relevant study of the subsequent ecological effects on the wetlands.					; Li, Mengfan/JDM-5034-2023	Li, Yunliang/0000-0002-0708-9138; 														2073-4441				MAR	2020	12	3							626	10.3390/w12030626	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12030626													WOS:000529249500011

Locating and characterising groundwater storage areas within an alpine watershed using time-lapse gravity, GPR and seismic refraction methods	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Unconsolidated sediments in alpine watersheds can store glacier melt and snowmelt as groundwater, which helps sustain flow in mountain rivers during dry periods. However, the amount and distribution of groundwater storage in rugged alpine terrain is not well understood, hindering our ability to predict the rate and timing of groundwater discharge into alpine streams. We show how non-invasive time-lapse microgravity surveys can be used to gauge the spatial distribution of groundwater storage changes within a large (ca 1500 x 1000?m) morainetalus field of the Lake O'Hara alpine watershed of the Canadian Rockies. Additional ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and seismic refraction surveys provide complementary information on subsurface bedrock topography and reveal the location of a major northwestsoutheast trending depression that likely controls groundwater flow to an alpine lake contiguous with the morainetalus field. Repeat relative gravity measurements made on a network of 80 gravity stations over and around the morainetalus field during the summers of 2009 and 2010 reveal gravity changes of up to 25 mu gal. Although the small gravity changes associated with groundwater flowing out of storage areas are noisy, significant changes are evident on the eastern side of the morainetalus field.

This reduction measure turned out to have decreased the loading only by a factor of two. A conceptual model was constructed based on laboratory measurements to describe phosphorus flow in the lake ecosystem for the summer of 1987. The role of zooplankton and fish was more important in phosphorus recycling than diffusion at the sediment-water interface. The input and output of phosphorus of the lake were at equilibrium and therefore, further reduction in external loading was needed for recovery. The results of the conceptual model agreed well with the output of the mathematical model PCLOOS. Additional measures such as dredging, flushing, chemomanipulation, or biomanipulation would be ineffective at the present level of external loading. Only a significant further reduction in external input will restore Lake Loosdrecht's water quality over a long period of time.																			0018-8158					MAY 15	1992	233	1-3					95	104		10.1007/BF00016099	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00016099													WOS:A1992JD64800011
J	Patterson, L; Cooper, DJ				Patterson, Lindsay; Cooper, David J.			The use of hydrologic and ecological indicators for the restoration of drainage ditches and water diversions in a mountain fen, cascade range, California	WETLANDS												An intact hydrologic regime and the presence of peat forming vegetation are critical for the persistence of fen wetlands. Fen restoration projects often focus on reestablishing water tables near the soil surface, with little effort directed toward identifying, historic hydrologic regimes, hydrologic modifications, and the sources of degradation. We used inconsistencies in the modern hydrologic regime and historic hydrologic indicators present in the soil seedbank, vegetation, and organic soil composition to identify areas of Drakesbad Meadow, a mountain fen in Lassen Volcanic National Park, California, that had been degraded. A network of ground-water monitoring wells and piezometers were used to identify the hydrologic regime of the 4.7-ha site. The presence of thick organic soils in sites with deep late summer water tables, inconsistencies between species present in the seedbank and the existing vegetation, and the presence of dry meadow species such as Poapratensis and Hordeum brachyantherum in areas with organic soils were used to determine that 2.4 ha of the site was degraded. A drainage ditch within the fen and diversions of the fen's water supply caused by a road outside of the fen were identified as the source of hydrologic modification and degradation. These were restored by blocking the flow of water in the main drainage ditch and by installing a series of channels to allow water to cross the road. Reconnecting flow beneath the road resulted in raising the summer water table from 80 cm below the soil surface to less than 10 cm in areas downslope of the road. The addition of five sheet-metal dams perpendicular to flow in the main drainage ditch resulted in raising the water table to within 10 to 20 cm of the soil surface in areas adjacent to and down gradient of the ditch. Before restoration, average late August water table levels across the entire site were 30 cm below the soil surface, while average post-restoration water table levels were 19 cm. below the soil surface. One year following hydrologic restoration, the percent canopy cover of species indicative of uplands and wet meadows, but not fens including Deschampsia cespitosa, Hordeum brachyantherum, and Poa pratensis decreased compared with pre-restoration years, while the cover of the peat-forming species Carex utriculata, Scirpus microcarpus, and Carex simulata increased. It is clear from our study that fens in this region will not persist under drought-like conditions created by water diversions, yet well-designed restoration projects can be used to restore modified hydrologic regimes and peat-forming vegetation necessary for the persistence of fen wetlands.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				JUN	2007	27	2					290	304		10.1672/0277-5212(2007)27[290:TUOHAE]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/0277-5212(2007)27[290:TUOHAE]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000247423000009

The results come from a long-term study of Siemianowka Dam Reservoir, located on the upper Narew River (NE Poland). From April to October 2007, 132 alga taxa were identified, including 32 Trachelomonas taxa, 23 of which are new for the reservoir; of those, three are first records for Poland: T. armata (Ehrenberg) Stein var. heterospina Swirenko, T. atomaria Skvortzov var. minor Hortobagi and T. minima Drezepolski. One variety, T. curta var. pappilata Wolowski, is described as new for science. The ultrastructural details of Trachelomonas species are illustrated. The highest number of Trachelomonas taxa was recorded in August in the shore zone of the reservoir. At the end of summer 2007, the conspicuous development of P. agardhii (Gomont) Anagnostidis et Komarek, caused a rapid decrease of Trachelomonas biomass due to lower water transparency and the oxygen concentration. In addition, a decline in the Trachelomonas taxa and biomass was associated with a decrease of water temperature. The negative impact of extracellular microcystin on the Trachelomonas development requires further study.					; Grabowska, Magdalena/E-2079-2018	Wolowski, Konrad/0000-0001-8298-7731; 													0003-4088	2100-000X					2014	50	1					49	57		10.1051/limn/2013070	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2013070													WOS:000333071600005
J	Buhay, WM; Wolfe, BB; Schwalb, A				Buhay, William M.; Wolfe, Brent B.; Schwalb, Antje			Lakewater paleothermometry from Deep Lake, Minnesota during the deglacial-Holocene transition from combined δ18O analyses of authigenic carbonate and aquatic cellulose	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Carbonate, cellulose, and bulk organic isotope data from varved sediments of Deep Lake (Minnesota) provide a record of paleohydrologic and paleoclimatic change during the deglacial-Holocene transition from 12,000 to 7500 cal BP. Deep Lake became enriched in O-18 in response to increased influence of maritime tropical moisture from the Gulf of Mexico between 12 000 and 9500 cal BP culminating in regional expansion of Pinus and Quercus, and then again as a result of increased aridity with the establishment of more zonal circulation and prairie vegetation by 8500 cal BP. Summer lake water temperatures simultaneously increased during the deglacial-Holocene transition, as suggested by decoupling of carbonate delta O-18 and cellulose-inferred lake water delta O-18 values between 11,000 and 9500 cal BP, and then declined briefly around 8600 cal BP, possibly in response to the cooling event associated with the final drainage of Glacial Lakes Agassiz and Ojibway into the Labrador Sea. Although the carbonate-cellulose paleothermometer generated unrealistically high values, these can readily be explained by imposing kinetic effects that occur during rapid carbonate precipitation and conservative estimates of a seasonal lag effect in the synthesis of cellulose with respect to carbonate. These new results suggest that climatic variations during the deglacial-Holocene transition in northwestern Minnesota were driven mainly by changes in large- scale atmospheric circulation and that Lake Agassiz played a comparatively minor role except during its final drainage.

Elemental composition of small pelagic fishes in three East African lakes: Implications for nutritional security	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Micronutrient deficiencies and food insecurity constitute major threats to human health across Africa. With decreasing availability of large-bodied fishes (>20 cm), strategies have developed to target small pelagic fish (SPF) species (<20 cm total length) to improve the food availability; yet little is known regarding their nutri-tional content. Three species of SPFs -Engraulicypris bredoi (muziri), Brycinus nurse (ragoogi) and Rastrineobola argentea (mukene) -were collected from lakes Albert, Victoria, and Nabugabo in Uganda, East Africa. The content of essential elements (Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, P, Se, and Zn) and non-essential, potentially toxic elements (Cd and Pb) were measured and compared in fishes across landing sites within lakes Victoria (R. argentea) and Albert (B. nurse, E. bredoi) and between lakes (R. argentea). Rastrineobola argentea was the most nutritious of the fishes examined, although some variation was present in their elemental concentration among landing sites. Overall, all three species contain high levels of essential nutrients and fall within a safe range for non-essential, toxic ele-ments based on current consumption habits. These SPFs can play an important role in addressing nutritional deficiencies in Uganda, and effort should be made to increase the availability, accessibility, and consumption of these under-utilized small fishes.

A Practical Approach to Developing Climate Change Scenarios for Water Quality Models	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												Climate model output is often downscaled to grids of moderately high spatial resolution (similar to 4-6-km grid cells). Such projections have been used in numerous hydrological impact assessment studies at watershed scales. However, relatively few studies have been conducted to assess the impact of climate change on the hydrodynamics and water quality in lakes and reservoirs. A potential barrier to such assessments is the need for meteorological variables at subdaily time scales that are downscaled to in situ observations to which lake and reservoir water quality models have been calibrated and validated. In this study, we describe a generalizable procedure that utilizes gridded downscaled data; applies a secondary bias-correction procedure using equidistance quantile mapping to map projections to station-based observations; and implements temporal disaggregation models to generate point-scale hourly air and dewpoint temperature, wind speed, and solar radiation for use in water quality models. The proposed approach is demonstrated for six locations within New York State: four within watersheds of the New York City water supply system and two at nearby National Weather Service stations. Disaggregation models developed using observations reproduced hourly data well at all locations, with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency greater than 0.9 for air temperature and dewpoint, 0.4-0.6 for wind speed, and 0.7-0.9 for solar radiation.					; Abatzoglou, John/C-7635-2012	Gelda, Rakesh/0000-0002-4741-5989; Mukundan, Rajith/0000-0003-4374-8935; 													1525-755X	1525-7541				JUN	2019	20	6					1197	1211		10.1175/JHM-D-18-0213.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-18-0213.1													WOS:000471114900001

In this study, 60 water samples were collected from various water sources that include bore wells, hand pumps and lakes of Srinagar City. Among them, 45 samples were taken from groundwater with depths ranging from 6 to - 126 m and the rest of the 15 samples were collected from surface sources like lakes, rivers and tap water. A gamma radiation survey of the area was carried out prior to collection of water samples, using a gamma radiation detector. A scintillation-based detector was utilized to measure radon, while as LED fluorimetry was employed to assess uranium in water samples. The average uranium concentration was found to be 2.63 mu g L-1 with a maximum value of 15.28 mu g L-1 which is less than the globally accepted permissible level of 30 mu g L-1. (222)Radon concentration varied from 0.2 to 38.5 Bq L-1 with an average value of 8.9 Bq L-1. The radon concentration in 19 groundwater samples (32% of total sites) exceeded the permissible limits of 11 Bq L-1 set by USEPA. This information could be of vital importance to health professionals in Kashmir who are researching on the incidence of lung cancers in the region given the fact that radon is the second leading cause of lung cancers after smoking worldwide.

As the second important macronutrient, phosphorus (P) fundamentally mediates the crop adaptability to climate change. An overview on previous work on crop P acquisition and soil P dynamics in responses to elevated CO2 and temperature would be critical for further advancing our knowledge on P cycling under climate change and its management to maintain agroecosystem sustainability. This review focuses on the effects of elevated CO2 and temperature on root morphology, root exudation, and associated biochemical properties in the rhizosphere in relevant to crop P acquisition and soil P availability. Studies indicate that elevated CO2 and temperature could increase P uptake of crops, such as rice and soybean when crops are grown within the range of optimal growth temperature. Elevated CO2 and temperature not only alter root exudates and changes the activity of soil enzymes and microbes the in rhizosphere environment, but also directly influence soil chemical and biochemical processes and thus the bioavailability of P. It is worth to focus on P-solubilizing microbial community composition, and microbial function on soil P mobilization in the rhizosphere of crops grown under climate change.

M.; Brookes, Justin D.; Jeppesen, Erik			Inflow-modulated inputs of dissolved organic matter fuel carbon dioxide emissions from a large hyper-eutrophic lake	WATER RESEARCH												Terrestrial dissolved organic matter (DOM) is potentially reactive and, upon entering lake ecosystems, can be readily degraded to low-molecular-weight organic matter and dissolved CO2. However, to date, there has been limited research on the links between long-term variation in the composition of DOM and CO2 emissions from lakes. Lake Taihu is a large, shallow, and hyper-eutrophic lake where DOM composition is strongly influenced by inputs from the rivers draining cultivated and urbanized landscapes. This study aims to investigate the impact of water chemistry and DOM characteristics, modulated by inflow-discharge dynamics, on the variability of pCO2 in Lake Taihu. Based on long-term seasonal observations from 2000 to 2022, we estimated the annual areal average CO2 flux (FCO2) to be 470 +/- 107 gCO2 m-2 yr-1 corresponding to a summed flux of 1.1 +/- 0.3 TgCO2 yr-1 from the lake. Elevated levels of FCO2 were found in 2004-2007, and across the dataset, the highest FCO2 was often observed in February and the lowest in August, corresponding with higher algal uptake in summer. Northwestern inflowing riverine DOM, consisting of both soil leachate and rapidly degradable domestic wastewater along with the input of riverine CO2 itself, explained the elevated FCO2 in the northwestern lake regions. Ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) can resolve the composition of DOM at the molecular level, revealing that CO2 concentrations vary with the relative abundance of terrestrially derived condensed aromatics. Incubation experiments further confirmed the link between the degradation of biologically labile DOM and aerobic CO2 production. We conclude that riverine organic matter inputs and subsequent degradation, modulated by inflow discharge, play a key role in shaping CO2 emissions from Lake Taihu over the past two decades.

J	Buchheim, HJP; Brand, LR; Goodwin, HT				Buchheim, HJP; Brand, LR; Goodwin, HT			Lacustrine to fluvial floodplain deposition in the Eocene Bridger Formation	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The depositional systems and sedimentology of lithofacies sequences in the Bridger Formation (unit B) are described. A lithofacies association is determined and includes from base to top: limestone, claystone, thin bedded sandstone and siltstone, and a cross-bedded sandstone facies. The limestone facies is generally composed of a dense resistant limestone that may contain fossil plant impressions, tufa and/or stromatolites, gastropods, bivalves, and other fossils. The claystone facies contains abundant fossil turtles, gar, crocodiles, gastropods and plants. Desiccation cracks, plant roots and soil features are lacking. Extremely abundant turtles may occur in this facies, sometimes associated with abundant coalified plant fragments. The thin bedded sandstone and siltstone facies is composed of silty clay to medium sand. At a few localities it grades laterally into medium- to course-grained sandstone channels up to 3 m thick. Fossil turtles are present, but are much less abundant than in the claystone facies. The cross-bedded sandstone facies is composed of thick, laterally extensive channel sandstones associated laterally with silty claystone beds. The lithofacies association is interpreted as a shallowing upward sequence. It started with a basal limestone facies. deposited in a widespread, shallow, carbonate-precipitating lake. The lake was rapidly filled by episodic volcaniclastic deposition, delivered via air-fall and/or prograding fluvial-deltaic systems. Deltaic deposition may have been similar to the infilling of the northern portion of Lake Turkana in Africa by the Omo River Delta. The claystone facies is interpreted as a short-lived fluvial-lacustrine system that prograded out over the limestone facies and/or was deposited as air-fall ash into the entire lake. The sharp upper contact of the limestone facies with the claystone facies suggests that an abrupt paleoenvironmental change may have taken place with a large influx of volcaniclastics. An organic-rich unit, the organic turtle bed within the Black Mountain turtle layer (a claystone facies), contains abundant plant material and turtles and is interpreted as representing an episodic depositional event, probably storm related. As volcaniclastic deposition continued to dominate the system, the thin bedded sandstone and siltstone facies sequence was deposited. It is interpreted as distributary and crevasse splay sheet sands uniformly deposited (laterally correlative) over large areas. This depositional system was ultimately replaced by a well-established, fluvial floodplain environment with large fluvial channels representing major meandering rivers. Development of the succeeding lake system occurred when siliciclastic deposition significantly slowed relative to the rate of basin subsidence. Deposition in the Bridger Formation, unit B, suggests a delicate balance between a closely interacting lacustrine and fluvial system. Although fluvial processes and elastic sedimentation dominated depositional patterns, lacustrine depositional regimes frequently returned. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

We surveyed 43 coastal Lake Ontario wetlands for muskrat houses during winter 2014, and compared zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression models to evaluate effects of wetland and surrounding landscape characteristics on the presence and abundance of muskrat houses. The most informative models were those indicating whether the wetland had an open connection to Lake Ontario. Connection to the lake, which exposed wetlands to the water regulation regime of the Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River system, had a negative influence on muskrat house abundance. Muskrats appeared to be absent from 56% of the surveyed wetlands, and houses occurred at a mean density of 0.27 houses/ha, which was lower than the mean density observed in previous studies. Mean muskrat house density was higher in wetlands without a connection to Lake Ontario (1.04 houses/ha), and muskrats were more prevalent in these wetlands (78%). The apparent low abundance of muskrats in the Lake Ontario study area is concerning, since muskrats are commonly recognized as "ecosystem engineers", and consequently, the loss of muskrats has the potential to affect both the biotic and the abiotic wetland characteristics.					; Bowman, Jeff/B-4147-2009; Greenhorn, Janet/HTT-3835-2023	Sadowski, Carrie/0000-0002-3323-6824; Bowman, Jeff/0000-0002-1892-4469; 													0277-5212	1943-6246				APR	2017	37	2					339	349		10.1007/s13157-016-0874-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-016-0874-0													WOS:000399236500013

These landforms lead to variations in topography in the relatively flat coastal plain. These variations in topography, while small, lead to large variations in soil moisture, which have a Substantial impact on carbon, water, and energy fluxes in these systems. in this Study, we hypothesize that the spatial patterns of soil moisture control variations in vegetation production, and hence remotely sensed greenness. We investigate the relationship between soil moisture and a remotely sensed measure of vegetation greenness, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Soil moisture was measured in the Summer of 2000 in the fetch of all eddy flux tower (0.5 km(2) footprint), and NDVI data were collected using an aerial digital multispectral camera system. Results indicate that the relationship between soil moisture and NDVI was significant in areas dominated by high-centered polygons and troughs, and where the general slope of the terrain promoted the redistribution of soil moisture. However, in areas with little to no relief, the correlation between soil Moisture and NDVI was not significant.

J	Painter, B				Painter, Brett			Protection of groundwater dependent ecosystems in Canterbury, New Zealand: the Targeted Stream Augmentation Project	SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												In Canterbury, New Zealand, native aquatic species habitat has significantly declined over the last century due primarily to land use change and climatic influences. The Canterbury Water Management Strategy (CWMS) aims to improve such habitat while also meeting other economic, environmental, social and cultural objectives. The focus of this paper will be on the Targeted Stream Augmentation (TSA) Project in the Selwyn-Waihora Zone in Canterbury. The semi-arid climate, significant demand for irrigation water and the up-gradient aquifer pressure provided by a coastal lake provide significant aquifer management challenges in this zone. In response to these challenges the local CWMS committee recommended that managed aquifer recharge trials to improve groundwater dependent ecosystems start in a highly targeted manner before gradually increasing the distance from recharge site to the target spring/s. A highly targeted pilot trial has shown the flow, temperature and nutrient concentration benefits for the target surface ecosystem. The implementation of two larger scale concepts combining surface and groundwater ecosystem benefits is now progressing. Lessons learned to date include the importance of keeping engagement processes ahead of technical assessments, and the benefits of high level scoping assessments before committing to detailed investigations and pilot projects.																			2363-5037	2363-5045				JUN	2018	4	2			SI		291	300		10.1007/s40899-017-0188-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40899-017-0188-2													WOS:000461218000013
J	Barney, RL				Barney, RL			The distribution of the fresh-water sheepshead, Aplodinotus grunniens Rafinesque, in respect to the glacial history of North America	ECOLOGY												From a study of the present distribution of the fish and of the Pleistocene history of the North American continent it appears that the species originated in the Gulf of Mexico some time prior to the last gla.ciation. The migrating fish established itself in the Rio Usumacinto of Central America, the Rio Grande, and the Mississippi River. In the latter, northward migration carried the species into the Pleistocene Great Lakes and Lake Agassiz through their discharge outlets. These outlets were destroyed and the fish became land-locked in the lakes. The species is accordingly found today in Lake Winnipeg (the dwindled Lake Agassiz), in the Great Lakes, and in their tributaries. Migration in glacial or recent time has established the fish in the St. Lawrence, the Champlain, and the Ottawa River basins. Support for the glacial distribution lies in the absence of the fish from the Mississippi River above the Falls of St. Anthony. This part of the Mississippi is post-glacial.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1926	7						351	364		10.2307/1929317	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1929317													WOS:000200148000033

Subalpine spruce-fir forests colonized the Zoige Basin during the interglacials and interstadials, implying warm and wet climate conditions. Alpine periglacial desert or dry desert may have existed during the penultimate glacial and the last glacial maxima, respectively. Alpine sedge meadow dominated the landscape during MIS 4. The MIS 3 is punctuated by a number of stadials similar to those documented in the Guliya and GISP2 ice cores, as indicated by repeated rise and fall of subalpine spruce-fir forests. Our pollen record reveals a regional climate history similar to those from the neighboring sites, including the Arabian Sea and the Guliya ice core, and thus supports the notion that the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau acts as an important link between climatic events in the North Atlantic realm and the Asian monsoon domain.

Antarctic lake phytoplankton and bacteria from near-surface waters exhibit high sensitivity to climate-driven disturbance	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs), Antarctica, represent a cold, desert ecosystem poised on the threshold of melting and freezing water. The MDVs have experienced dramatic signs of climatic change, most notably a warm austral summer in 2001-2002 that caused widespread flooding, partial ice cover loss and lake level rise. To understand the impact of these climatic disturbances on lake microbial communities, we simulated lake level rise and ice-cover loss by transplanting dialysis-bagged communities from selected depths to other locations in the water column or to an open water perimeter moat. Bacteria and eukaryote communities residing in the surface waters (5 m) exhibited shifts in community composition when exposed to either disturbance, while microbial communities from below the surface were largely unaffected by the transplant. We also observed an accumulation of labile dissolved organic carbon in the transplanted surface communities. In addition, there were taxa-specific sensitivities: cryptophytes and Actinobacteria were highly sensitive particularly to the moat transplant, while chlorophytes and several bacterial taxa increased in relative abundance or were unaffected. Our results reveal that future climate-driven disturbances will likely undermine the stability and productivity of MDV lake phytoplankton and bacterial communities in the surface waters of this extreme environment.

J	Friday, M; Haxton, T				Friday, Mike; Haxton, Tim			Evaluating the effects of controlled flows on historical spawning site access, reproduction and recruitment of lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens spawn at the base of Kakabeka Falls, a 39 m waterfall on the Kaministiquia River, a tributary to Lake Superior. Access to this historical spawning site can be restricted or delayed due to hydroelectric flow fluctuations that coincide with the A. fulvescens spawning season. The objectives of this study were to determine (a) the necessary flow conditions that facilitate spawning site access; (b) quantity and duration of flow required for successful spawning and dispersal of larvae; and (c) evaluate recruitment of juvenile A. fulvescens in relation to flow. A. fulvescens spawning migrations were tracked using a stationary telemetry receiver that logged the movements of 166 A. fulvescens fitted with radio-transmitters. Unrestricted access to the spawning site was facilitated when spawning flow was controlled at 23 m(3) s(-1) in 2004 and 17 m(3) s(-1) in 2006. Fluctuating (0.5-8.5 m(3) s(-1)) and delayed spawning flows resulted in restricted and delayed access to the spawning site. Flow duration for successful egg incubation, hatch and larval dispersal was determined by sampling larvae using drift nets and quantified using cumulative temperature units (CTU). Over 10 years, 10,083 larvae were captured between 31 May and 20 July with 97% of the drift occurring prior to 30 June. From the date of first spawning to the end of larval dispersal took an average of 38.6 days, and the mean CTU value was 398.6. In general, a minimum flow of approximately 14.5 m(3) s(-1) from the date of initial spawning to the accumulation of c. 400 CTU ensured successful hatch and larval dispersal. During the timeframe of this study, recruitment was variable. This study described the complex and variable reproductive life history of A. fulvescens and defined spawning flow requirements ecologically, which can be used to develop operational provisions at hydropower facilities to ensure successful reproduction.					; Haxton, Tim/H-7857-2019	Friday, Mike/0000-0002-6042-5962; Haxton, Tim/0000-0002-9767-3986													0022-1112	1095-8649				DEC	2021	99	6					1940	1957		10.1111/jfb.14900	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.14900		SEP 2021						34480342					WOS:000700320800001

Molecular epidemiology of Schistosoma mansoni in Uganda: DNA barcoding reveals substantial genetic diversity within Lake Albert and Lake Victoria populations	PARASITOLOGY												Representative samples of Ugandan Schistosoma mansoni from Lake Albert and Lake Victoria were examined using DNA barcoding, sequence analysis of two partially overlapping regions - ASMIT (396 bp) & MORGAN (617 bp) - of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase Subunit I (cox1). The Victorian sample exhibited greater nucleotide diversity, 1.4% us. 1.0%, and a significant Population partition appeared as barcodes did not cross-over between lakes. With one exception, Lake Albert populations were more mixed by sampled location, while those from Lake Victoria appeared more secluded. Using statistical parsimony, barcode ASMIT 1 Was putatively ancestral to all others and analysis of MORGAN cox1 confirmed population diversity. All samples fell into two of five well-resolved lineages; sub-lineages therein broadly partitioning by lake. It seems that barcode ASMIT 1 (and close variants) was likely widely dispersed throughout the Nilotic environment but later diversified in situ, and in parallel, within Lake Albert and Lake Victoria. The genetic uniformity of Ugandan S. mansoni can no longer be assumed, which might better explain known epidemiological heterogeneities. While it appears plausible that locally evolved heritable traits could spread through most of the Lake Albert populations, it seems unlikely they could quickly homogenise into Lake Victoria or amongst populations therein.

P.; Juyal, Navin			A 1000-year history of large floods in the Upper Ganga catchment, central Himalaya, India	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Determining the frequency, magnitude and causes of large floods over long periods in the flood-prone Himalaya is important for estimating the likelihood of future floods. A thousand year record (with some information from 2600 years ago) of the frequency and some estimates of velocities and discharges of large floods has been reconstructed in the Upper Ganga catchment, India, using written reports, lithostratigraphy and sedimentology, and dated by optical and radiocarbon methods. In the Upper Ganga catchment rainfall triggers large landslides that dam rivers and release large amounts of water when they burst, thereby amplifying the effects of rainfall. The large floods in the catchment may be the result of landslide dam bursts rather than glacial lake bursts, and these are likely to continue and possibly worsen as the monsoon intensifies over the next century. However preliminary information suggests that the recent devastating flood of June 2013 was the result of heavy rainfall not landslide dam bursts. The frequency record is non-random and shows a high frequency between AD 1000 and AD 1300 (omitting uncertainties), then a low frequency until a cluster of floods occurred about 200 years ago, then increased frequency. This temporal pattern is like but not identical with that in Peninsular India, and both appear to be the result of variations in the monsoon. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Climate and vegetation changes during the Lateglacial and early-middle Holocene at Lake Ledro (southern Alps, Italy)	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Adding to the on-going debate regarding vegetation recolonisation (more particularly the timing) in Europe and climate change since the Lateglacial, this study investigates a long sediment core (LL081) from Lake Ledro (652ma.s.l., southern Alps, Italy). Environmental changes were reconstructed using multiproxy analysis (pollen-based vegetation and climate reconstruction, lake levels, magnetic susceptibility and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements) recorded climate and land-use changes during the Lateglacial and early-middle Holocene. The well-dated and high-resolution pollen record of Lake Ledro is compared with vegetation records from the southern and northern Alps to trace the history of tree species distribution. An altitudedependent progressive time delay of the first continuous occurrence of Abies (fir) and of the Larix (larch) development has been observed since the Lateglacial in the southern Alps. This pattern suggests that the mid-altitude Lake Ledro area was not a refuge and that trees originated from lowlands or hilly areas (e.g. Euganean Hills) in northern Italy. Preboreal oscillations (ca. 11 000 cal BP), Boreal oscillations (ca. 10 200, 9300 cal BP) and the 8.2 kyr cold event suggest a centennial-scale climate forcing in the studied area. Picea (spruce) expansion occurred preferentially around 10 200 and 8200 cal BP in the south-eastern Alps, and therefore reflects the long-lasting cumulative effects of successive boreal and the 8.2 kyr cold event. The extension of Abies is contemporaneous with the 8.2 kyr event, but its development in the southern Alps benefits from the wettest interval 8200-7300 cal BP evidenced in high lake levels, flood activity and pollen-based climate reconstructions. Since ca. 7500 cal BP, a weak signal of pollen-based anthropogenic activities suggest weak human impact. The period between ca. 5700 and ca. 4100 cal BP is considered as a transition period to colder and wetter conditions (particularly during summers) that favoured a dense beech (Fagus) forest development which in return caused a distinctive yew (Taxus) decline.We conclude that climate was the dominant factor controlling vegetation changes and erosion processes during the early and middle Holocene (up to ca. 4100 cal BP).

J	MacIntyre, S; Sickman, JO; Goldthwait, SA; Kling, GW				MacIntyre, S; Sickman, JO; Goldthwait, SA; Kling, GW			Physical pathways of nutrient supply in a small, ultraoligotrophic arctic lake during summer stratification	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												During the ice-free period in the Arctic, the thermal structure and mixing dynamics of small lakes change with the passing of air masses. In Toolik Lake, Alaska, stable warm air masses during the ice-free season were associated with lake warming, daily winds were maximally 4-7 m s(-1) for less than 12 h duration, lake numbers (L-N) varied daily between 2 and 80, and values of the coefficient of vertical eddy diffusivity ranged from molecular to 10(-6) m(2) s(-1). For the 3-week warming period following ice-off, vertical mixing, which occurred primarily near the lake's sloping boundaries, supplied inorganic nitrogen only to phytoplankton in the chlorophyll maxima and only at rates sufficient to support 10-22% of their daily needs. In the upper water Column, chlorophyll concentrations and primary productivity decreased by a factor of three relative to the maximum at ice-off. In contrast, during transitions between warm and cold air masses or the converse, wind speeds exceeded 5 m s(-1) for over 1 d and L-N decreased to values of 3 or lower for periods of 1-2 d. In consequence, turbulence increased by one to two orders of magnitude, dispersing the chlorophyll maximum into multiple layers and increasing solute concentrations in hypolimnetic waters. Increased precipitation accompanied cold air masses, and in one case stream discharge of similar to 30 times base flow led initially to an overflow and subsequently to a metalimnetic intrusion with loading of inorganic nitrogen 10 times the daily needs of phytoplankton. Overall, the frequency with which frontal systems moved through the region determined the temporal variance in nutrient supply. Spatial variability within the lake was generated by the degree of penetration of incoming streams and the vertical layering of intrusions. These temporal events and the layers induced are hot spots of activity important for sustaining growth in oligotrophic lakes.

The record is not homogeneous in that the correlation level varies quite strongly over time. The period between 1910 and 1050 shows completely uncorrelated behaviour. In the most recent 40 years the correlation is found to be strongest in the region just south of the Great Lakes in the states of Illinois, Iowa, and Indiana. Correlation maps are presented that show the degree of association for the corn yield in those 41 states for which records are available. For the entire record the highest correlations occur with the sea-surface temperature anomalies appearing after the corn is harvested in September to February of the following year. Since corn yields are a proxy for summer agricultural drought in the central part of the USA, the droughts during the period 1910 to 1950 must have had some other cause.																			0899-8418					DEC	1990	10	8					819	828																WOS:A1990EP97300003

In addition, screening of enzymatic activities, heavy metal tolerance and antagonistic potential against phytopathogenic fungi were tested. A total of 74 bacterial isolates were screened and phylogenetically characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results showed a heterogeneous group of microorganisms falling within two major phyla, 52 strains belonging to Firmicutes (70.2%) and 22 strains (30.8%) of gamma-Proteobacteria. In terms of main genera present, the isolates were belonging to Bacillus, Halobacillus, Lentibacillus, Oceanobacillus, Paraliobacillus, Planomicrobium, Salicola, Terribacillus, Thalassobacillus, Salibacterium, Salinicoccus, Virgibacillus, Halomonas, Halovibrio, and Idiomarina. Most of the enzymes producers were related to Bacillus, Halobacillus, and Virgibacillus genera and mainly active at 10% of growing salt concentrations. Furthermore, amylase, esterase, gelatinase, and nuclease activities ranked in the first place within the common hydrolytic enzymes. Overall, the isolates showed high minimal inhibitory concentration values (MIC) for Ni2+ and Cu2+ (0.625 to 5 mM) compared to Cd2+ (0.1 to 2 mM) and Zn2+ (0.156 to 2 mM). Moreover, ten isolated strains belonging to Bacillus, Virgibacillus and Halomonas genera, displayed high activity against the pathogenic fungi (Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium oxyporum, F.verticillioides and Phytophthora capsici). This study on halophilic bacteria of unexplored saline niches provides potential sources of biocatalysts and novel bioactive metabolites as well as promising candidates of biocontrol agents and eco-friendly tools for heavy metal bioremediation.					; Gonzalez-Paredes, Ana/AAY-8429-2020; MENASRIA, Taha/J-2476-2014; benhadj, mabrouka/AGC-7601-2022; Menasria, Taha/J-2476-2014; BENAMMAR, LEYLA/AGE-5927-2022; BENAMMAR, Leyla/AGE-5927-2022; Aguilera, Margarita/M-8238-2013	Benhadj, Mabrouka/0000-0003-3694-6423; Menasria, Taha/0000-0003-4925-6165; BENAMMAR, Leyla/0000-0002-0852-8737; Gonzalez Paredes, Ana/0000-0002-3504-0841; Aguilera, Margarita/0000-0002-3204-9787													0959-3993	1573-0972				SEP	2019	35	9							132	10.1007/s11274-019-2705-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-019-2705-y								31432260					WOS:000482390800002

A collection of approximate to 75 accessions has been assembled. From those selections approximate to 3500 plants have been propagated in a commercial nursery and are being distributed to grower-cooperators and nurseries for evaluation. Two foundation trials have been established in central Florida, one at the University of Florida, IFAS, Citrus Research and Education Center (CREC), Lake Alfred and another at Water Conserv II, Winter Garden. The initial effort showed that all the pomegranate selections were easy to propagate and in the field, nursery plants in 1-gal containers grown on a citrus-based irrigation and nutritional program reached heights of 4 to 5 ft in 1 year with a healthy appearance. The plants at Water Conserv fruited after 1 year with many selections producing 15 to 35 fruit. Cercospora leaf spot caused some leaf drop and other unknown pests and/or diseases affected fruit development. An herbicide study using containerized `Parfyanka' plants grown in sand soil showed unacceptable phytotoxicity to label rate applications of indaziflam, diuron, and norflurazon, but the injury from pendimethalin and simazine was <= 10%.																			0886-7283						2011	124						33	40																WOS:000692113200010

Cultural Sources of Strength and Resilience: A Case Study of Holistic Wellness Boxes for COVID-19 Response in Indigenous Communities	FRONTIERS IN SOCIOLOGY												The COVID-19 pandemic has had disproportionately severe impacts on Indigenous peoples in the United States compared to non-Indigenous populations. In addition to the threat of viral infection, COVID-19 poses increased risk for psychosocial stress that may widen already existing physical, mental, and behavioral health inequities experienced by Indigenous communities. In recognition of the impact of COVID-19 related psychosocial stressors on our tribal community partners, the Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health Great Lakes Hub began sending holistic wellness boxes to our community partners in 11 tribal communities in the Midwestern United States and Canada in summer of 2020. Designed specifically to draw on culturally relevant sources of strength and resilience, these boxes contained a variety of items to support mental, emotional, cultural, and physical wellbeing. Feedback from recipients suggest that these wellness boxes provided a unique form of COVID-19 relief. Additional Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health offices have begun to adapt wellness boxes for the cultural context of their regions. This case study describes the conceptualization, creation, and contents of these wellness boxes and orients this intervention within a reflection on foundations of community-based participatory research, holistic relief, and drawing on cultural strengths in responding to COVID-19.

Helicopter-borne radar imaging of snow cover on and around glaciers in Alaska	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY												During spring 2013, we performed 500 MHz, helicopter-borne impulsive ground-penetrating radar surveys of several glaciers and glacier forelands in south-central Alaska, USA. These surveys were designed to obtain spatially distributed measurements of snow accumulation spanning a broad range of continental and maritime climatic zones. Visual assessment of radar images shows that data quality varied with the terrains and was optimal for snow that covered smooth glacier ice and firn, smooth debris-covered areas and moraines, freshwater lake and river ice, tundra, and taiga. Conversely, returns from the base of the snowpack were unrecognizable over rough debris-covered glacier termini, icefalls and some high-altitude accumulation basins. Optimal flying speed was 15-20 m s(-1) (30-40 kt). At these speeds, which are two to three times faster than previously reported for such surveys, we could still identify snow-depth data with confidence, at a point spacing of similar to 1.5-2.0 m. Data quality on glaciers decreased with increased air speed, though useful echoes from the base of the snowpack were still obtained at 40-45 m s(-1) (87 kt; data point spacing of 6-8 m). Similar high-speed surveys over non-glacial terrains were unsuccessful, as basal reflections were no longer recognizable.

Two main phases were discerned using sedimentary features, delta C-13, delta N-15, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (N), C/N and cluster analysis of pollen data, temporally synchronized with radiocarbon age dating. The data indicates the presence of a lagoon system surrounded by a tidal plain colonized by mangroves and its sedimentary organic matter sourced from C-4 plants between similar to 8050 and similar to 7115 cal yr BP. However, during the mid- and late-Holocene the mangroves shrank and freshwater vegetation expanded (C-3 plants), probably, due to a marine regression. During this phase, the development of a lacustrine environment was followed by the colonization of herbs, trees and shrubs. The continuous sediment infilling into the lake allowed the expansion of a herbaceous plain as seen today. This geomorphologic and vegetation evolution is in agreement with the mid-Holocene RSL maximum above present RSL and subsequent fall to the present time. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We used digital camera (i.e., PhenoCam) to monitor the phenology of forest (i.e., 2 sites with one being closer to a lake) and grassland (i.e., 1 site) ecosystems in the Badain Jaran Desert, China. The vegetation phenology was quantified using vegetation indices calculated from the red, green, and blue digital numbers in images obtained by the PhenoCams. Additionally, various meteorological variables were continuously measured, and gross primary production (GPP) was obtained using the eddy covariance technique at the grassland site. The difference between the phenological periods extracted from the PhenoCam images and the artificial visual method was small (<= 6 days), indicating that the digital camera can effectively obtain desert vegetation phenology. The key meteorological factors affecting changes in the vegetation indices were identified, with temperature being the most important factor (i.e., correlation coefficients = 0.4-0.8 and p-value < 0.001 for all three study sites). Although precipitation showed weak correlation with the vegetation index (correlation coefficient = 0.18-0.14, p-value < 0.01), rapid increases in the vegetation index were observed in response to precipitation events. Vegetation indices were strongly correlated with GPP variations at the grassland, and the strongest correlation was observed in the green-up stage (correlation coefficient = 0.67 to 0.85, p-value < 0.001). The highest GPP lagged about 1 month behind the peak in the vegetation indices in summer (June-August). Our results can markedly improve the knowledge of desert ecosystem processes and aid in assessing the influence of future climate changes in drylands.

Fluxes of PCBs at all but one location prone to significant sediment resuspension peaked in the late-1960s/early-19905, before declining thereafter. Input fluxes of HBCDs at all sites increased from first emergence in the mid-1960s.Thereafier, fluxes peaked in the late-1980s/early-2000s, before declining through to the present, except at the most urban site where HBCD fluxes are still increasing. Trends of PBDEs predominant in the Penta-BDE and Octa-BDE formulations vary between sites. While at some locations, fluxes peaked in the late-1990s/early-2000s; at others, fluxes are still increasing. This suggests the full impact of EU restrictions on these formulations has yet to be fell. Fluxes of BDE-209 have yet to peak at all except one location, suggesting little discernible environmental response to recent EU restrictions on the Deca-BDE product. Strikingly, fluxes of BDE-209 in the most recent core slices either exceed or approach peak fluxes of Sigma PCBs, implying substantial UK use of Deca-BDE. Excepting HBCDs, inventories of our target contaminants correlated significantly with local population density, implying substantial urban sources. (C) 2015 Elsevier BA,. All rights reserved.

Assessment of Some Heavy Metal Residues in Fish Muscles Collected From Kitchiner Drain and Burullus Lake in Kafrelsheikh Governorate, Egypt.	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE												The current study was conducted to investigate the bioaccumulation of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd),iron (Fe) and chromium (Cr) in the muscle tissues of Tilapia, Catfish, Sea bream and Sea bass fishes collected in Autumn (2023) from Kitchener Drain and Burullus Lake, Kafrelsheikh Governorate, Egypt. For this purpose, a total of 120 muscle samples, 60 of Tilapia and Catfish (30, each) from three different areas in Kitchener Drain in the Nile river (10, each). And 60 of Sea bream and Sea bass (30, each) from three different areas in Burullus Lake (10, each) were analyzed for the heavy metals mentioned above in order to assess the health risk. Our results revealed that Fe and Cr levels in all analyzed fish samples from different areas were less than the maximum permissible limit. While Pb and Cd residues in all analyzed fish samples from all different areas were higher than the maximum permissible limit. Results showed that the highest mean levels of all tested heavy metals were recorded in southern area of Kitchener Drain and eastern area of Burullus Lake with respect to all metals. The dangerous residues for human health were shown in the following order with referring to their heights above the maximum permissible limits: Cd>Pb> Fe> Cr. In conclusion, Kitchener Drain and Burullus Lake are considered a hazardous source for lead and cadmium in fish muscles.																			1110-0222	2357-089X				DEC	2025	56	13			SI		57	654		10.21608/ejvs.2025.374047.2775	http://dx.doi.org/10.21608/ejvs.2025.374047.2775													WOS:001543388400001

The first stage, until about the mid 1980s, was characterized by intense volcanic-hydrothermal activity, high (above 40 degrees C) temperature, high salinity (up to 40 g/l) and an increase in the level (and volume) of the lake. During the second stage, which lasted 25-30 years, since the mid-1980s until the mid-2000s, the lake cooled down, until freezing in winter, the mineralization decreased (up to 1.6 g/l), and the volume of the lake remained almost constant. After the mid-2000s until present, there is a period of activation of the Maly Semyachik volcano, which is expressed in an increase in temperature, mineralization and a sharp increase in the volume of the crater lake. The water balance of the lake and the input and composition of the thermal acid chloride solution are estimated based on the analysis of changes in chemical and physical parameters over time, using a box model.

Spatial and seasonal occurrence of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) in fish influenced by snowmelt and municipal effluent discharge	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In the present study we examined spatial and seasonal trends in the levels of a wide suite of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) in brown trout (Salmo trutta) and mottled sculpin (Coitus bairdii) in East Canyon Creek, Utah, USA, an effluent-dominated stream during summer months. Fish samples were collected from four sampling sites, including one reference site upstream, and three sites at incremental distances downstream of the effluent discharge over multiple seasons. The samples were analyzed for 218 lipophilic contaminants, including pesticides and their metabolites, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and polybrominated Biphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and other flame retardants. Some PAHs, pesticides and their metabolites, PCBs, PBDEs and other flame retardants were measured in mottled sculpin (11 analytes) and brown trout (17 analytes). Hexachlorobenzene (HCB), p,p'-DDE, BDE-47 and triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) were the most frequently detected contaminants in mottled sculpin and brown trout, while BDE-47 and p,p'-DDE were measured at the highest concentrations, reaching up to 73 and 19 ng/g wet weight, respectively. Our results indicated that snowmelt did not alter accumulation of the examined lipophilic contaminants, and no consistent seasonal differences were observed in their accumulation. A spatial pattern was observed for PBDE congeners, where lowest levels were measured in fish tissues from a reference site, and highest concentrations were measured in fish collected downstream of the effluent discharge, indicating that municipal effluent discharge contributes to the elevated PBDE levels in fish residing in this effluent-dominated stream. We further calculated screening level consumption risks following United Stales Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) methods, and identified the importance of considering discharge gradients in effluent-dominated systems during bioaccumulation assessments.					; Brooks, Bryan/B-2612-2010; Salamova, Amina/L-6567-2014	Burket, S.

In the southern Alps, the high-altitude Lake Petit (Mercantour Massif, France; 2200 a.s.l.) offers pollen and diatom-rich sediments covering the last 4800 years. A multi-proxy analysis recently revealed a detrital pulse around 4200 cal BP due to increasing erosion in the lake catchment. The involvement of a rapid climate change leading to increasing runoff and soil erosion was proposed. Here, in order to clarify this hypothesis, we measured the oxygen isotope composition of diatom silica frustules (delta O-18(diatom)) from the same sedimentary core. Diatoms were analysed by laser fluorination isotope ratio mass spectrometry after an inert gas flow dehydration. We additionally enhanced the accuracy of the age-depth model using the Bacon R package. The delta O-18(diatom) record allows us to identify a 500-year time lapse, from 4400 to 3900 cal BP, where delta O-18(diatom) reached its highest values (> 31 parts per thousand). delta O-18(diatom) was about 3 parts per thousand higher than the modern values and the shifts at 4400 and 3900 cal BP were of similar amplitude as the seasonal delta O-18(diatom) shifts occurring today. This period of high delta O-18(diatom) values can be explained by the intensification of O-18-enriched Mediterranean precipitation events feeding the lake during the ice-free season. This agrees with other records from the southern Alps suggesting runoff intensification around 4200 cal BP. Possible changes in other climatic parameters may have played a concomitant role, including a decrease in the contribution of O-18-depleted Atlantic winter precipitation to the lake water due to snow deficit. Data recording the 4.2 ka BP event in the northwestern Mediterranean area are still sparse. In the Lake Petit watershed, the 4.2 ka BP event translated into a change in precipitation regime from 4400 to 3900 cal BP. This record contributes to the recent efforts to characterize and investigate the geographical extent of the 4.2 ka BP event in the Mediterranean area.

J	Bakker, ES; Hilt, S				Bakker, Elisabeth S.; Hilt, Sabine			Impact of water-level fluctuations on cyanobacterial blooms: options for management	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Climate change can promote harmful cyanobacteria blooms in eutrophic waters through increased droughts or flooding. In this paper, we explore how water-level fluctuations affect the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms, and based on the observations from case studies, we discuss the options and pitfalls to use water-level fluctuations for lake and reservoir management. A drawdown in summer causes an increase in retention time and increased water column nutrient concentrations and temperature of shallow water layers, which may lead to severe cyanobacterial blooms. This effect can potentially be counteracted by the positive response of submerged macrophytes, which compete for nutrients with cyanobacteria, with a higher chance of cyanobacterial blooms under eutrophic conditions. The balance between dominance by submerged macrophytes or cyanobacteria is temperature sensitive with stronger positive effects of drawdown as inhibition of cyanobacterial blooms expected in colder climates. Complete drying out reduces the amount of cyanobacteria in the water column after refilling, with lower water nutrient concentrations, lower fish biomass, lower abundance of cyanobacteria, higher transparency, and higher cover of submerged plants compared to lakes and reservoirs that did not dry out. Water-level rise as response to flooding has contrasting effects on the abundance of cyanobacteria depending on water quality. We conclude that water-level fluctuation management has potential to mitigate cyanobacterial blooms. However, the success will depend strongly on ecosystem properties, including morphometry, sediment type, water retention time, quality of inlet water, presence of submerged vegetation or propagules, abundance of fish, and climate.

Predation of smelt on vendace larvae: experimental and field studies	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Lake HoytiAinen in eastern Finland has suffered from a prolonged vendace Coregonus albula (L.) recession during the last two decades. The present study examined the capacity of smelt Osmerus eperlanus (L.) to prey on vendace larvae as well as the diet of smelt in Lake HoytiAinen to reveal its possible predation on vendace larvae. The larvae were observed to be most vulnerable to smelt > 100 mm (TL) predation at a total length of 13 mm. In Lake HoytiAinen, the diet of smelt was clearly dominated by zooplankton and no vendace larvae were found in the stomachs, probably due to small size of the smelt and low abundance of the larvae. Spawning time of smelt and larval period of coregonids overlap in spring and an observed decrease in feeding activity of smelt during spawning time may provide a temporal refuge against predation. Although smelt has been found to intensively predate on coregonid larvae in other lakes, it does not play an important role in maintaining the present low-density state of vendace in Lake HoytiAinen.

LAKE TROUT, SALVELINUS-NAMAYCUSH	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												During the summer of 1954, 1.5-year-old, hatchery-raised lake trout, S. namaycush, were subjected to 15 minutes of severe muscular exercise at the trout hatchery at Summerland, B. C. Following exercise, fish were allowed to recover for various intervals up to 24 hours. Blood samples were taken and analyzed. The hemoglobin levels did not change significantly, the blood glucose increased significantly during the 2d hour of recovery. Except for dips at the 6th and 12th hours, this high level of glucose persisted to the end of 24 hours. The blood level of lactic acid increased 7-fold immediately following exercise and continued to increase during the first two hours of recovery. The lactic acid level declined rapidly between the 2d and 6th hours. The initial low unexercised level was reached by the end of 24 hours. The hemoglobin and lactic acid changes were very similar to those noted for Kamloops trout, Salmo gairdneri.																									1957	14	4					645	649		10.1139/f57-023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f57-023													WOS:A1957WW49500010

Previous studies of such lakes have rarely focused on the within-lake spatiotemporal variability, which is critical for generating representative whole-lake fluxes, and better understanding and constrain large-scale emissions. To address this issue, we determined the variability of CH4 fluxes and CH4 concentrations in two small shallow (<= 150 cm) lakes in Central Europe biweekly over almost 2 years. We found that both lakes were a source of CH4, mainly by ebullition. At the shallower Lake Heideweiher, which temporarily dried out, the average flux was 7.2 mmol m(-2) d(-1), the average flux from Lake Windsborn that never dried out, was 3.5 mmol m(-2) d(-1). The spatial differences (between and within lakes) were most strongly related to sediment C-content and quality, which in turn was linked to depth or distance to shore. The highest fluxes occurred in the central parts of both lakes. The temporal variability of the fluxes was primarily correlated with sediment temperature and degree of drying measured as the time since drying up. The whole-lake estimates were dominated by low water periods and the warm summer months. Overall, we show that short-term and small-scale measurements cannot account for the high variability of CH4 fluxes from small lakes, and that reliable large-scale assessments need to consider such spatiotemporal variability.					; Knorr, Klaus-Holger/B-8321-2008	Bastviken, David/0000-0003-0038-2152; Praetzel, Leandra/0000-0003-0401-5245; Knorr, Klaus-Holger/0000-0003-4175-0214													0024-3590	1939-5590				JUN	2021	66	6					2455	2469		10.1002/lno.11764	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11764		MAY 2021											WOS:000647183000001

Sediment/soil samples in Caohai lake, Guizhou Province, China and adjacent upland lakeshore were collected. The abundances of total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), TOC:TN, TOC: total phosphorus (TP), and TN:TP in the lake sediments were significantly higher than those in the surrounding lakeshore soils. 42.86% of the surface sediments exhibited TOC and TN concentrations above the severe effect level, whereas all selected TP concentrations fell between the lowest effect and severe effect levels. Sediment-bound TOC and TN were mainly derived from the endogenous residues, while TP was primary deposited in the form of inorganic phosphorus. Targeted measures should be implemented to reduce the levels of sediment-bound TOC and TN in Caohai Lake.																			2039-9898	2281-4485					2026	71						29	36		10.60923/issn.2281-4485/22419	http://dx.doi.org/10.60923/issn.2281-4485/22419													WOS:001592992400001

The lake is extremely rich in suspended glacial flour in summer (glacier melting season). Measurements were taken from June 2004 to October 2005 from 1.2 mu m filtered samples. OC concentration remained extremely low throughout the year (below I mg C L-1). MBTH carbohydrate concentration was very low in the lake (0.06-0.43 mg C L-1 1) and in the two tributary rivers (0.06-0.25 ing C L-1 1). Lake carbohydrate concentration only correlated with phytoplanktonic biomass at the onset of the productivity period. The results suggest that differences in MBTH concentration may sometimes reflect differences in the nature of the carbohydrates rather than differences in carbon concentration. Extensive fibril formation was evidenced by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations. ROM concentration in the lake was also very low (0.1-0.2 mg C L-1). Significant variation in ROM riverine input was due to either annual occurrences (snow melting) or irregular episodes (floods). Melting snow was responsible for about 30% of the lake's annual ROM input. One box mass balance calculations showed that about 25% of ROM was lost within the lake. Evidence gleaned from TEM and STXM (scanning transmission X-ray microscopy) observations clearly indicates that this is mainly caused by ROM sedimentation after association with inorganic colloids.

The chronology is continuous from 88AD to 2008AD. This time series has been analysed with respect to its possible use for climate reconstruction. Correlations with climatic data showed strong dependence between MXD of growth rings and temperature of April, May, June, July, August and September and a weaker, negative dependence with precipitation of May and September. For solar radiation a positive relationship was noted for April, July, August and September. Light rings were frequently observed within the analysed samples and the climate of years with light rings was examined. Mean monthly temperatures in January, June, August, September and October, averaged during light ring years, were cooler than during years without light rings. Precipitation was also significantly reduced in March during light ring years. In turn, solar radiation during light ring years has significantly lowered values in February and August. The occurrence of light rings was often positively related to strong volcanic events. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

The main aim of the current study is to assess the microplastic ingestion by aquatic organisms across diverse trophic levels. To achieve this objective, zooplankton, mussels (Anodonta anatina), and fish (Carassius gibelio) were collected from the highly polluted Susurluk River Basin in Turkiye. The size distribution encompassed 160.8 & PLUSMN; 56.9 & mu;m for the prevailing zooplankton, 6.9 & PLUSMN; 2.2 cm for mussel, and 20.4 & PLUSMN; 3.1 cm for fish, respectively. While no microplastic ingestion was observed among zooplankton, the finding highlights the influence of body-size and pollution on microplastic ingestion. In contrast, A. anatina and C. gibelio contained 617 and 792 microplastic particles, respectively. Predominantly, fibers emerged as the most prevalent microplastic type across trophic levels (except zooplankton) followed by films. Notably, only fish exhibited fragments within their gastrointestinal tract. A substantial correlation emerged between microplastic abundance and mussel size and weight, but no such correlation manifested for fish. The study also revealed a positive link between microplastic count and turbidity (phosphate and high Chl a level), impacting mussel ingestion capacity due to the variability in the food availability and potential shifts in feeding preferences. Conversely, no distinct pattern emerged for fish concerning water quality parameters and ingested microplastics. Consequently, our study underscores diverse microplastic uptake patterns in freshwater ecosystems, with a predominant frequency of microplastics falling with the 0.3 mm-3.0 mm range, emphasizing the significance of size-selective uptake by organisms.

Total organic carbon and authigenic carbonate in two independently analyzed and dated cores indicate (1) relative stability and aridity during the glacial interval, (2) small variations during the BOlling-AllerOd and the Younger Dryas intervals, (3) comparatively abrupt change at the late Pleistocene/Holocene transition, and (4) relatively high variability during a wet early Holocene. Taken together, the data suggest that a climate threshold exists for penetration of Asian monsoon rainfall onto the Tibetan Plateau, a threshold that was crossed at the beginning of the Holocene. Conceptually, the threshold simply may be related to the topographic barrier that the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau presents to the landward penetration of the monsoon, or it may be related to nonlinearities in the climate system itself, such as sudden shifts in the configuration of the Westerly jet stream. Different mechanisms for producing a threshold are not mutually exclusive and may have combined to affect the dynamics of the Asian monsoon. In any case, the threshold is related to the presence of the Tibetan Plateau, which has a profound influence on the Asia monsoon system.

J	Spencer, CN; Potter, DS; Bukantis, RT; Stanford, JA				Spencer, CN; Potter, DS; Bukantis, RT; Stanford, JA			Impact of predation by Mysis relicta on zooplankton in Flathead Lake, Montana, USA	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												We documented major changes in the zooplankton community of Flathead Lake following the appearance of Mysis relicta. The three common cladocerans found in the lake decreased in abundance, most notably Daphnia longiremis which virtually disappeared from the lake. Copepods were also affected by M.relicta, especially Diacyclops thomasi which decreased in abundance by an order of magnitude. The only macrozooplankton species which seemed to benefit from the presence of M.relicta was Leptodiaptomus ashlandi. The varied responses of dominant zooplankton species appeared to be the result of a combination of factors. Laboratory feeding studies indicate that M.relicta preferred Cladocera over Copepoda, with the following order of feeding preference: Bosmina longirostris > D, longiremis > Daphnia thorata > L. ashlandi > D. thomasi. The two zooplankton species which declined most following the appearance of M.relicta showed the greatest degree of habitat overlap with M.relicta. Daphnia longiremis and D. thomasi, together with M. relicta, are cold stenotherms and were concentrated in the hypolimnion during the summer. Finally, another trait shared by D. longiremis and D. thomasi was the absence of a diapause stage, which made them vulnerable to predation by M.relicta throughout the year.																			0142-7873					JAN	1999	21	1					51	64		10.1093/plankt/21.1.51	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/21.1.51													WOS:000078342800004

Multimodal-TERESA, a 210Pb-based radiometric dating model for recent sediments under largely varying rates of supply	QUATERNARY GEOCHRONOLOGY												Lead-210 from natural atmospheric fallout is widely used in multidisciplinary studies for dating recent sediments. In anthropogenically-impacted and/or high energy systems the Pb-210 flux onto the sediments may show non-random temporal variability, leading to the failure of classical dating models. The problem of how identifying and dating such cases remained unsolved, and it is the goal of the present work. Empirical evidences from varved sediments prove that initial activity concentrations of excess Pb-210 (Pb-210(exc)) and sediment accumulation rates (SARs) show large and independent temporal variability. M-TERESA model describes such variability by using multimodal frequency distributions and decodes the chronology from the Pb-210(exc) versus mass depth profile. The new model can solve scenarios with largely varying rates of supply, which fall beyond the limits of the piecewise versions of the classical models. Its use is demonstrated with some complex Pb-210(exc) profiles from varved sediments and synthetic cores for which an alternative and complete reconstruction of palaeofluxes and SARs is possible. The paper is supported by a wide set of supplementary material, including numerical codes for applying TERESA. The proposed methods are also useful for improving the reliability of routinely applications of the Pb-210-based radiometric dating of recent sediments.

Is zooplankton an indicator of the water trophic level in dam reservoirs?	OCEANOLOGICAL AND HYDROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES												The trophic state of ten dam reservoirs was assessed using a zooplankton community. In order to determine the trophic state of dam reservoirs, we used indices calculated on the basis of density and species structure of Rotifera and Crustacea communities. Samples were collected once during summer 2012 in ten dam reservoirs. The largest numbers of zooplankton taxa were found in a lowland high meso-eutrophic dam reservoir (Koronowski) and the lowest ones in a submontane low eutrophic dam reservoir (Lubachowski). The trophic state was determined for the investigated dam reservoirs. In the case of the Rotifera community, the percentage of the tecta form in the Keratella cochlearis population and the proportion of high-trophic species in the total species density were the best indices to describe the water trophic status. In the case of the crustacean community, the best indices were the density of Crustacea and the biomass of Cyclopoida. The high value of all indices calculated on the basis of density and species structure of Rotifera and Crustacea was determined for Zygmunt August Lake, whose trophic status was defined as highly eutrophic to polytrophic. Our study has shown that zooplankton could be a good ecosystem indicator of the water trophic level in dam reservoirs.

Whole-lake effects of invasive crayfish (Orconectes spp.) and the potential for restoration	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Effects of invasive species are often extrapolated to whole systems based on small-scale, short-term, and (or) single-system studies. For example, previous laboratory studies and in-lake cage experiments suggest that invasive crayfish Orconectes rusticus and O. propinquus reduce macrophyte and snail abundance in north temperate lakes, and snapshot lake surveys provide supporting evidence. Still, these impacts have not been demonstrated in multiple whole lakes over time. Thus, in summer of 2003, we resurveyed benthic invertebrates and macrophytes in lakes originally surveyed by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources in the late 1930s. Our multilake survey supports the macrophyte results from small-scale and comparative studies: macrophyte species richness and abundance declined significantly in invaded lakes relative to uninvaded lakes. We next conducted a laboratory seed-bank study to examine the potential for macrophyte restoration in a lake occupied by rusty crayfish for at least 15 years. Only two macrophyte species (Najas flexilis and Chara spp.) germinated from sediments from the invaded lake compared with eight species from reference sediments. This suggests that invaded lakes may have depauperate seed banks and that restoration of invaded macrophyte communities may require manual planting, even if crayfish could be removed.

This has largely gone unnoticed in global carbon budgets. My aim was to quantify the CO2 emanating from freshwater from 66 degrees N to 47 degrees S latitudes via in situ bacterial respiration (BR). I determined BR (n = 326) as a function of water temperature. Freshwater is emitting CO2 at a rate of 58.5 Pg C y(-1) (six times that of fossil fuel burning). Most is emitted from the Northern Hemisphere. This is because the high northern summer temperatures coincide with most of the world's freshwater. Diffuse DOC sources, for example dust, may be driving high freshwater BR. However, many sources remain elusive and not individually quantified in the literature. We must include freshwater CO2 emissions in climate models. Identifying, quantifying and managing freshwater's diffuse sources of Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) will hopefully provide us with another opportunity to change our current climate trajectory.																				2296-665X				JUN 6	2022	10								904955	10.3389/fenvs.2022.904955	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.904955													WOS:000813305000001

Using a statistical technique that compares patterns or trends that are not uni-directional, the lakes were grouped into 18 subsets or clusters, each with between 2 and 11 lakes that had similar trends. These temporal trends were strongly correlated with several climate indices, notably the Arctic Oscillation Index (AOI) measured in the autumn. and the annual North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI). Because these clusters of lakes were spatially dispersed, they could not be compared directly with trends in wet S deposition, because S deposition varied substantially between lakes within each cluster. However, the average trend in SO42- concentration was evaluated in each of 10 regions of Norway that were defined previously on the basis of pollution load, meteorological variables and biogeography. Although these regions did not match the statistically-selected clusters of lakes with equal trends very closely there were similar, strong correlations between climate indices (the AOI and NAOI) and the 10 average SO42- trends. although there were even stronger relationships with average wet S deposition in the regions. When subsets of lakes with coherent SO42- trends were selected from within each of the 10 regions, both wet S deposition and the climate indices were strongly correlated with those SO42- trends. Hence, lakes in Norway respond to changes in wet S deposition and are influenced by large-scale, i.e. global, climate signals. Future evaluation of recovery of lakes affected by acid deposition must therefore consider the confounding effects of climate and potential climate change.

This includes an explanation of how ice masses are formed from snow, which falls and settles in an accumulation zone, hardens into firn snow and consequently glacial ice, and then flows downward and across the equilibrium line into an ablation zone, where it melts. The mechanics of how ice masses move are outlined, as well as the occurrence of surges and the formation of crevasses, ogives, and moulins. The effects of subglacial, geothermal and volcanic activity on glaciers are also explained, particularly the formation of ice cauldrons and ice-dammed lakes, along with the reasons for the phenomenon of outburst floods, or jokulhlaups, from glaciers. The landforms resulting from glacial movements and fluvial processes are also defined, e.g. moraines, canyons, and gravel outwash plains.																					978-94-6239-207-6; 978-94-6239-206-9				2017	2						3	37		10.2991/978-94-6239-207-6_1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2991/978-94-6239-207-6_1	10.2991/978-94-6239-207-6												WOS:000400347800004

K.; Singh, Tejpal			Examining the glacial lake dynamics in a warming climate and GLOF modelling in parts of Chandra basin, Himachal Pradesh, India	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The presented study reports applicability of Lake Detection Algorithm (LDA) for an automated extraction of glacial lakes over a large geographical region and dynamics of Samudra Tapu and Gepang Gath glacial lakes. The areal extent of lake boundary extracted through LDA and areal extent of manually interpreted lake boundary exhibit a remarkable agreement (R-2-0.99). Glacial lake dynamics is assessed in terms of areal and volumetric expansion for two selected glacial lakes from 1979 to 2017, i.e. Samudra Tapu (0.95 km(2)), and Gepang Gath (0.67 km(2)). They show volumetric expansion from 8.52 x 10(6) m(3) (1979) to 80.34 x 10(6) m(3) (2017) and 2.04 x 10(6) m(3) (1979) to 32.44 x 10(6) m(3) (2017) respectively. Statistical analysis (Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope) of climate data indicates rise in mean annual temperature (0.021 degrees C yr(-1); 1961-2015) and fall in annual precipitation (-2.74 mm yr(-1); 1951-2015) at different confidence intervals. Further Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) is modelled using empirical relationship and Simplified Dam Breach Model (SMPDBK). The SMPDBK demonstrates discharge of 3866.52 and 2100.90 m(3) s(-1) reaching Chhatru and Sissu village posing threat to life and property. The study also exhibits that glacial shrinkage under the influence of climate change causes expansion of glacial lakes. This expansion is expected to intensify catastrophic GLOF and resultant fatalities and destruction in the downstream region. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Evaluating efficiencies and cost-effectiveness of best management practices in improving agricultural water quality using integrated SWAT and cost evaluation tool	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Agricultural conservation practices, or agricultural best management practices (BMPs), can reduce nutrient loading and help address harmful algal blooms (HABs). HABs in the western basin of Lake Erie, which are largely caused by phosphorus losses from the Maumee River watershed, are critical in the recent years. In this study, a new BMP cost tool was developed. Then the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and the new BMP cost tool were integrated to explore efficiencies and cost-effectiveness of BMPs in an agricultural catchment of the Maumee River watershed with various scenarios. The scenarios included individual BMPs applied in 100% of suitable areas, individual BMPs targeting Dissolved Reactive Phosphorus (DRP) and Total Phosphorus (TP) critical areas, and BMPs implemented in series. In addition, a cost-effective approach for the selections and placements of BMPs in agricultural watersheds was developed as an alternative to running complex optimization tools that are not applicable to large watersheds. The cost-effective approach applied BMPs based on cost-effectiveness rankings starting from the most cost-effective one. Results showed that: (1) BMPs implemented in series, which reduced pollutant loads more than individual BMPs, were not as cost-effective as some individual BMPs; (2) among all scenarios, filter strips targeting DRP/TP critical areas were the most cost-effective in reducing yearly/spring DRP/TP losses; (3) to obtain the watershed management plan goal of reducing March-July DRP/TP losses by 40%, implementing BMPs one by one in critical areas based on the cost-effectiveness rankings of individual BMPs in DRP/TP critical areas was the most cost-effective; and (4) the simulation results, modeling tools, and cost-effective approach can help create agricultural BMP strategies to cost-efficiently improve water quality.

Decreased Mortality of Lake Michigan Chinook Salmon after Bacterial Kidney Disease Challenge: Evidence for Pathogen-Driven Selection?	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC ANIMAL HEALTH												In the late 1960s, Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha from the Green River, Washington, were successfully introduced into Lake Michigan. During spring from 1988 to 1992, large fish die-off's affecting Chinook salmon Occurred in the take. Multiple ecological factors probably contributed to the severity of the fish kills, but the only disease agent found regularly was Renibacterium salmoninarum, the causative agent of bacterial kidney disease. In this study, survival after challenge by R. salmoninarum was compared between two Chinook salmon stocks: a Lake Michigan stock from Wisconsin (WI) and the progenitor stock from the Green River. We found that the WI stock had significantly greater survival than the Green River stock. Next, the WI and Green River stocks were exposed to the marine Pathogen Listonella anguillarum (formerly Vibrio anguillarum), one of the causative agents of vibriosis; survival after this challenge was significantly poorer for the WI stock than for the Green River stock. A close genetic relationship between the Green River and WI stocks was confirmed by analyzing 13 microsatellite loci. These results collectively suggest that disease susceptibility of Lake Michigan Chinook salmon has diverged from that of the source population, possibly in response to pathogen-driven selection.

This study combines chironomid assemblages with sedimentological, mineralogical and geochemical data of a short sediment core (37.5 cm) from the high-altitude (>4,733 m asl), saline (9 g L-1) and shallow (similar to 5 m water depth) Shen Co, located in the southern part of the central Tibetan Plateau. The predominantly littoral, species-poor (10 chironomid morphotypes) chironomid assemblages are dominated by salt-tolerant taxa, that are highly sensitive to lake level fluctuations and macrophyte vegetation dynamics, making them ideally suited for tracking lake level changes over time. Results indicate a period (from ca. 1830 to 1921 CE) of drier conditions with low runoff and high evaporation rates in the Shen Co catchment, as indicated by a dominance of low-Mg calcite and dolomite and increased Ca/Fe and Sr/Rb ratios. This resulted in a decline in lake levels, an increase in salinity and the periodic occurrence of desiccation events at the sampling site. The first chironomid morphotype to appear after the dry period is Aericotopus indet. morphotype incurvatus, which indicate still low (<2 m) but rising lake levels after 1921 CE due to increasing runoff and a lower evaporation/precipitation ratio, as reflected by coarser grain size, higher quartz content and increased TN, TOC and Al/Si ratios. A replacement of A. indet. morphotype incurvatus by Procladius is observed as lake level rise continued after 1950 CE. The highest lake level is proposed for the period since 2006 CE. From 1955 to 1960 CE and from 2011 to 2018 CE, the presence of the phytophilic taxon Psectrocladius sordidellus-type supported abundant macrophyte growth. These changes are consistent with climate reconstructions from the northern and central Tibetan Plateau, indicating warmer and wetter climate conditions since the beginning of the 20th century, which have led to an increase in lake level in a number of Tibetan lakes. Our study specifically highlights 1920 and 1950 as years with enhanced precipitation. This can be attributed to strong overlapping multidecadal cycles of Westerlies and monsoon systems. This study demonstrates the significance of studying small, shallow lakes, as they frequently contain aquatic communities that respond more rapidly to the changes in the lake system. In addition, this study expands our understanding of the ecology of Tibetan chironomid morphotypes, highlighting this group's potential as paleolimnological proxies for investigating past environmental and climatic changes.

Sediment Melt-Migration Dynamics in Perennial Antarctic Lake Ice	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												We examined sediment melt-migration dynamics in the ice cover of Lake Fryxell, Taylor Valley, McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, using a combination of laboratory experiments, field observations, and modeling. The specific objectives were to determine the thermal conditions required for sediment melt and how sediment migration rates vary with meteorological forcings and ice microstructure. These characteristics are relevant to the influence of climate change on lake ice structure and ecosystem processes in polar regions. Sediment began melting through laboratory ice at -2 degrees C in simulated summer conditions, with warmer ice producing faster melt rates. An energy balance model, supported by our laboratory experiments, demonstrated that subsurface sediment can melt down to an equilibrium depth of similar to 2 m in two years. Field experiments and modeling revealed that surficial sediment melts at about half the rate of subsurface sediment because of heat losses to shallow, cold ice and the cold, dry atmosphere. Gravity flow of sediment along grain boundaries was pronounced in laboratory ice warmer than -1 degrees C. This mechanism produced a flux of 0.1 g m(-2) hr(-1), a significant value relative to published benthic sedimentation rates for these lakes indicating an important sediment sorting mechanism.																			1523-0430	1938-4246				FEB	2010	42	1					57	66		10.1657/1938-4246-42.1.57	http://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1938-4246-42.1.57													WOS:000275560500006

However, these traditional setups fall short when it comes to efficiently managing graph data, particularly those conforming to the Labeled Property Graph (LPG) model. To address this gap, this paper introduces GraphAr, a specialized storage scheme designed to enhance existing data lakes for efficient graph data management. Leveraging the strengths of Parquet, GraphAr captures LPG semantics precisely and facilitates graph-specific operations such as neighbor retrieval and label filtering. Through innovative data organization, encoding, and decoding techniques, GraphAr dramatically improves performance. Our evaluations reveal that GraphAr outperforms conventional Parquet and Acero-based methods, achieving an average speedup of 4452x for neighbor retrieval, 14.8x for label filtering, and 29.5x for end-to-end workloads. These findings highlight GraphAr's potential to extend the utility of data lakes by enabling efficient graph data management.																			2150-8097					NOV	2024	18	3					530	543		10.14778/3712221.3712223	http://dx.doi.org/10.14778/3712221.3712223													WOS:001491902000002

Walleyes and white bass were collected in fall gillnetting surveys from 1980 to 1995. A general linear model was constructed to determine the least-squares means of walleye and white bass W(r)s by length category and year. Contrast statements were used to test for significant differences in the annual W(r)s of walleye and white bass population length categories before and after the establishment of alewives. The annual mean W(r)s of walleyes of stock to quality (S-Q), quality to preferred (Q-P), and preferred to memorable (P-M) lengths and Q-P-length white bass increased significantly, whereas that of S-Q-length and P-M-length white bass decreased significantly after 1988.

Agricultural phosphorus balance trends in Ontario, Michigan and Ohio. Can. J. Soil Sci. 91: 437-442. Agriculture is one of the sources of phosphorus (P) that feeds into Lake Erie, impacting water quality. A substantial proportion of the agriculture in Ontario, Michigan and Ohio falls in the Lake Erie drainage basin. We examine trends in the balance of the major inputs and outputs of P to the soils of this region. Only a few decades ago, recommended rates of P application for optimum crop nutrition amounted to considerably more P than crops removed. In recent years, actual P applications have come much closer to balancing removals, while crop yields have increased. This trend has positive implications for both crop productivity and water quality. The P balance serves as an appropriate performance indicator for P management reflecting both economic and environmental aspects of sustainability. Depending on assumptions regarding the recoverability of manure and the current implementation of reduced-P feeding strategies in the livestock industry, estimates of the P balance for the region in 2008 range from a surplus equivalent to 1% of crop removal to a deficit amounting to 23% of the amount of P removed by crops.

We have compared four different perch populations from the northern part of the Gulf of Bothnia (Umea, Sweden), representing two anadromous populations, one lake population and one brackish sea population. The lake is isolated from the Gulf of Bothnia due to elevation of shorelines during the last 100 years. This short time of isolation provides an opportunity to study the very early stages of population differentiation. Genetic differentiation of populations was analysed using mtDNA D-loop sequence polymorphism and RAPD's. Both the mtDNA and the RAPD data revealed highest level of genetic differentiation between the reproductive behavioural forms from around Umea. Furthermore, AMOVA and Chi-square analyses of the mtDNA haplotypes revealed relatively high level of differentiation of the lake perch population given the short time of isolation.

Continuous water pCO(2), pCH(4), and pO(2) measurements were gathered to estimate gas fluxes in one temperate reservoir (Riviere-des-Prairies) and two boreal reservoirs (Eastmain-1 and Robert-Bourassa) in Quebec, and in four boreal reservoirs (Grand Rapids, Jenpeg, Kettle, and McArthur Falls) in Manitoba, Canada. Mean daily CO2 fluxes ranged between 7 and 14 mmolCO(2) . m(-2) . d(-1) in Manitoba and between 15 and 55 mmolCO(2) . m(-2) . d(-1) in Quebec. Summertime episodes of water undersaturation in CO2 were observed at Jenpeg, Kettle, and McArthur, suggesting higher productivities of these systems compared to the other systems studied. Mean daily CH4 fluxes ranged between 0 and 69 mu molCH(4) . m(-2) . d(-1) in Manitoba and between 9 and 48 mu molCH(4) . m(-2) . d(-1) in Quebec. Comparisons of results obtained in the Eastmain-1 area using automated monitors, floating chambers or dissolved gas analyses over multiple-station field campaigns demonstrated that a continuous GHG monitor at a single sampling station provided representative and robust results.

J	TONN, WM				TONN, WM			DENSITY COMPENSATION IN UMBRA-PERCA FISH ASSEMBLAGES OF NORTHERN WISCONSIN LAKES	ECOLOGY												Small, shallow seepage lakes in northern Wisconsin that have both low winter O2 concentrations and low pH possess depauperate fish assemblages containing primarily or exclusively central mudminnows, U. limi and yellow perch, Perca flavescens. Six times during 3 yr the total densities of fish in 5 lakes were determied by mark-recapture and catch-per-effort methods. The richness of the fish assemblages in these lakes varied from 1-3 spp. in a nested pattern. While seasonal variations in density occurred within and among lakes due to variations of growth, mortality, and recruitment, total densities overall were independent of species richness. This pattern, called complete density compensation, suggests that total densities are expressions of the lake''s similar abilities to support fish and that the species interact rather than being independent. An intense negative correlation between perch and mudminnow densities was found, suggesting a strong interspecific population dominance of perch over mudminnows. There was also indirect evidence that both competition (exploitation and interference) and predation by perch regulate mudminnow populations when the species co-occur. Because these assemblages were unpredictably variable in time and space, conclusions from single censuses would have been unreliable. An exercise simulating single seasonal censuses from each richness class showed that less than 1/2 of such single censuses would have produced the pattern of complete compensation that was observed in the field study. The relative importance of the factors that determine community structure, or even the factors themselves, can differ not only from assemblage to assemblage at any one time, but even from season to season or year to year within a single assemblage.

J	BONAN, GB				BONAN, GB			SENSITIVITY OF A GCM SIMULATION TO INCLUSION OF INLAND WATER SURFACES	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												A land surface model that includes a subgrid parameterization for inland water (lake, swamp, marsh) was coupled to a modified version of the NCAR CCM2. The coupled model was run for 5 yr with and without inland water subgrid points to determine the importance of inland water for global climate simulation. In July, the inclusion of these water bodies resulted in a spatially consistent signal in which high inland water regions were 2 degrees-3 degrees C cooler, had increased latent heat flux (10-45 W m(-2)), and decreased sensible heat flux (5-30 W m(-2)) compared to the simulation without these water bodies. These changes were statistically significant in the lake region of northwest Canada, the Great Lakes region of North America, the swamp and marsh region of the Siberian lowlands, and the lake region of East Africa, but were not significantly different in the swamp and marsh region of Finland and northwest Russia. The effect on Northern Hemisphere January air temperature was difficult to interpret due to large interannual variability. In tropical lake regions (East Africa), the response to lakes was less in the rainy season (January) than in the dry season (July). Precipitation was unchanged in both months except for the Great Lakes region where precipitation increased in January. These changes in temperature, precipitation, and surface fluxes were consistent with mesoscale modeling studies of the effects of lakes on climate and tended to bring the model closer to observations. In particular, the summer cooling in North America helped reduce a large warm temperature bias in the model, but did not eliminate the bias. The lakes had little effect on atmospheric moisture, radiation, or zonal circulation.

Niche compression intensifies competition between reintroduced American martens (Martes americana) and fishers (Pekania pennanti)	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY												Carnivores exhibit strong interspecific competition and partition niche axes to minimize agonistic interactions. Niche partitioning, though, is contingent upon resource heterogeneity, and recent landscape homogenization may limit the abilities of carnivores to partition niche space. The negative fitness consequences associated with niche overlap may be particularly problematic for repatriating carnivores, and could delay the recovery of rare or endangered species. American martens (Martes americana) and fishers (Pekania pennanti) are the most commonly translocated carnivores in North America and both were reintroduced to a highly modified landscape in Wisconsin, United States. To date, fishers have flourished while martens remain endangered. To assess the role of competition in marten recovery, we used a combination of occupancy modeling, point pattern analyses, and stable isotope analyses to assess 5 coexistence mechanisms: spatial segregation, dietary segregation, temporal avoidance, and differential use of habitat and snow features. Over 7 years, we observed consistently high fisher occupancy and consistently low marten occupancy. Moreover, martens and fishers overlapped in their use of space and time, and neither exhibited habitat preferences. Isotopic analyses revealed complete dietary overlap, with martens falling entirely within the isotopic niche of fishers. Deep, uncompressed snow, however, had a negative effect on fisher activity. We propose that extensive landscape homogenization has resulted in niche compression and that marten recovery has been limited by increased competition with fishers. Restoration programs often overlook competitive interactions, but our results emphasize the importance of interspecific competition for recovering carnivore populations and highlight the challenge of reconstructing carnivore communities in increasingly homogenized landscapes.

Based on the preferred habitat and appearance, we hypothesized that Chara species may use bicarbonate efficiently for photosynthesis accompanied by calcification. We measured photosynthesis and calcification in incubation experiments of 3-18 h duration with seven species of Chara by quantifying changes in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), oxygen, alkalinity and calcium. All Chara-species used bicarbonate efficiently according to: 1) an unaltered photosynthetic rate between pH 7.5 and 8.5 and a modest decline at pH 9.5, and 2) their ability to drive pH above 10 and deplete CO2 below 0.1 mu M. Calcification measured by the parallel loss of bicarbonate and dissolved calcium to precipitated calcium carbonate increased markedly with rising pH, resulting in additional consumption of DIC and a falling molar quotient of oxygen release to DIC consumption from 1.61 at pH 7.5 to 0.68 at pH 9.5. The stoichiometry of alkalinity and calcium loss relative to oxygen production at pH 9.5 was in accordance with simultaneous calcification and photosynthetic assimilation, which buffers pH rise. Our findings support that Chara species are efficient bicarbonate users and calcifying organisms. Through calcification, Chara species maintain photosynthesis at high pH and can form dense stands in oligotrophic hardwater lakes and ponds.					; Borum, Jens/K-5167-2014; Baastrup-Spohr, Lars/K-4696-2014	Martinsen, Kenneth Thoro/0000-0001-8064-513X; Kristensen, Emil/0000-0001-6717-2921; Baastrup-Spohr, Lars/0000-0001-8382-984X; Kragh, Theis/0000-0002-9760-2571													0304-3770	1879-1522				OCT	2018	149						46	51		10.1016/j.aquabot.2018.05.005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2018.05.005													WOS:000439400000007

Spatial and temporal diversity of microcystins and microcystin-producing genotypes in Oneida Lake, NY	HARMFUL ALGAE												Oneida Lake is a shallow, eutrophic lake with a well-established cyanobacterial population with reported toxic blooms containing hepatotoxic microcystins (MC). Peak bloom events from the summers of 2002 and 2003 were analyzed to determine the principal cyanobacterial genera containing microcystin synthetase (mcy) genes. Sequence analysis of a partial mcyA amplicon targeting Microcystis, Anabaena and Planktothrix sp. indicated that Microcystis sp. was the dominant mcy genotype. This Microcystis clade was split into two distinct sub-clades. Bloom events contained members of both sub-clades with the higher MC concentrations found when both sub-clades were present in near equal proportions. The proportion of Microcystis containing the mcyD gene ranged from 0 to 37% of the total Microcystis population as determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR). The total concentration of Microcystis containing mcyD genes was linearly related to the concentration of MCs (r(2) = 0.63). The relationship between mcy genotype and physiochemical variables was examined to determine the factor(s) controlling the periodicity in MC production in Oneida Lake. Multivariate statistical analyses, used to correlate the continuous-response variables, revealed a strong relationship between chlorophyll a, MCs and total Microcystis. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Timing of Yellow Perch Otolith Annulus Formation and Relationship between Fish and Otolith Lengths	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We estimated the timing of annulus formation and the relationship between otolith radius length (whole view) and total length (TL) in yellow perch Perca flavescens from South Dakota lakes. Marginal increment analysis indicated that a single opaque band is formed during the summer months and that the timing of annulus formation varies with fish age. The lowest marginal increment measurements (i.e., those suggesting that annulus formation was recently completed) were most likely to occur in July, but at Waubay Lake the lowest increment for some cohorts was observed in August. Fish of age 4 or less were more likely to complete annulus formation during June. Personnel responsible for aging otoliths need to be aware of the differential timing of annulus formation. Significant relationships were observed between yellow perch TL and otolith radius length for 49 populations. Nearly all (98%) of the regression intercepts were negative. Back-calculated TLs were estimated from otolith annulus measurements using the direct proportion method and compared with the TLs previously measured for three populations. The back-calculated TL estimates were similar to the previously observed TLs, suggesting that the direct proportion method can be used to back-calculate TLs from yellow perch otoliths.																			0275-5947						2012	32	2					239	248		10.1080/02755947.2012.672364	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2012.672364													WOS:000303601100005

This macrophyte species appeared for the first time in the lake in 2004, lasted approximately three months and was considered as a temporary habitat The chironomid community was very abundant in the stands of this macrophyte species, which developed at three sues The recorded species belong to three subfamilies Chironominae (Chironomini and Tanytarsini, Orthocladinnae and Tanypodinae Species composition varied in time, though Orthocladinnae with their representative Cricotopus sylvestris gr dominated throughout the enure sampling period, accounting for approx 60% of the total community However, the presence of this species group experienced a marked drop to only 10% in September when Chironomini larvulae and Paratanytarsus sp prevailed. Furthermore, the share of Endochironomus albipennis (Meigen 1830) in relation to other species was also consistently higher.

J	van den Hoff, J; Bell, E				van den Hoff, John; Bell, Elanor			The ciliate Mesodinium rubrum and its cryptophyte prey in Antarctic aquatic environments	POLAR BIOLOGY												For growth, the mixotrophic ciliate Mesodinium rubrum sequesters organelles from ingested prey. Feeding in the field is poorly known; however, isolates of an Antarctic M. rubrum strain are maintained in culture on a diet of Teleaulex/Plagioselmis/Geminigera-like cryptophytes, suggesting that cryptophyte presence may be an important factor controlling M. rubrum distribution and abundance in nature. We augmented field surveys with published findings to establish the distribution of both M. rubrum and a Geminigera-like cryptophyte in a range of East Antarctic aquatic environments. We also studied their overwinter abundances in Ace Lake to determine whether a predator-prey relationship existed between the two species in this natural enclosed ecosystem. The ciliate and the cryptophyte co-occurred in the majority of sites sampled which ranged widely in salinity (2.2-150 aEuro degrees) and temperature (-3.0-16 A degrees C). We observed a cyclic relationship in species abundances in Ace Lake, implying population growth for M. rubrum responded to changed cryptophyte abundance. Mesodinium rubrum likely exerts top-down pressure on cryptophyte abundances in natural enclosed ecosystems especially under low-light winter conditions. The ciliate can be considered an apex predator in highly truncated food webs.																			0722-4060	1432-2056				AUG	2015	38	8					1305	1310		10.1007/s00300-015-1686-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00300-015-1686-z													WOS:000358041600019

At present the dam impounds 17 million cubic meters of water in Lake Sarez. Flood volume and discharge estimates were made for several landslide generated floods that could overtop the dam. For landslide volumes of 200, 500, and 1,000 million cubic meters, estimated overtopping flood volumes were 2, 22, and 87 million cubic meters of water, respectively. Estimated peak discharge at the dam for these three flood scenarios were 57,000, 490,000, and 1,580,000 m(3)/s, based on triangular hydrographs of 70-, 90-, and 110-s durations, respectively. Flood-routing simulations were made for the three landslide-induced overtopping floods over a 530-km reach of the Bartang and Panj Rivers below the Usoi dam. A one-dimensional flow model using a Riemann numerical solution technique was selected for the analysis. For the 87 million cubic meter volume overtopping flood scenario, the peak flows were approximately 1, 100, 800, and 550 m(3)/s at locations 50, 100, and 150 km downstream of the dam respectively.

Images of stars and sparks in May Anthropological and ontological testimonies	CESKA LITERATURA												The article explores the role played by the motif of stars and sparks in the first to third songs of Macha's poem May. Stars appear in the first canto, both in reference to stars whose light is going out and in the form of sparks (the reflection of starlight) playing on the waves of the lake. In the second canto, the extinct (dead) star that is falling forever through dark space connotes human life exposed to nothingness. If the sparks on the lake are characterised as 'lost light', then, it is said, man is unable to determine which spark is a reflection of which star, and is thereby also unable to reveal the source of the light and of earthly beauty. Humans are thus unable to discern whether earthly beauty and earthly life really have any supernatural (transcendent) source.

Resonance of the '4.2ka event' and terminations of global civilizations during the Holocene, in the palaeoclimate records around PT Tso Lake, Eastern Himalaya	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Climate driven changes have impacted various civilizations and have major influence on human population globally. Remote regions such as the Himalaya also archived these climatic events in various proxies. The Eastern Himalaya region has recorded the Holocene climate change events in numerous proxy records. A multi-proxy record of the early to late-mid Holocene climate change from the catchment of PankangTeng Tso (PT Tso) Lake at an altitude of 3935 m asl in the Tawang district of Arunachal Pradesh was studied. A 90 cm sediment profile showed a synchronous pattern of Holocene climate changes in the palynological, environmental magnetic and carbon isotope data recorded. Dominant cold-humid conditions at 4625 cal yr BP followed by a cold-dry period was documented in the proxy data. The vegetation vis-a-vis climate varied throughout the Holocene and cold-dry conditions along with sub-alpine vegetation prevailed in the region around the "4.2ka event". Human activities and environmental changes in the Tawang district during the Holocene probably impacted the vegetation during this significant period of the development and demise of major global civilizations.					; Laskar, Amzad/K-5125-2019	Mehrotra, Nivedita/0000-0003-3735-2838; Laskar, Amzad/0000-0003-1875-8314; Shah, Santosh K./0000-0002-1635-5936													1040-6182	1873-4553				FEB 25	2019	507				SI		206	216		10.1016/j.quaint.2018.09.027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2018.09.027													WOS:000464516500020

Hydroclimate change in the Garhwal Himalaya, India at 4200 yr BP coincident with the contraction of the Indus civilization	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												High-resolution analysis of a 3.80 m sediment core recovered from Deoria Tal, a mid-elevation lake located at 2393 m a.s.l. in the Garhwal Himalaya, documents long-term and abrupt hydroclimate fluctuations in northern India during the mid- to late Holocene. The sediment chronology, based on ten C-14 dates, indicates the core spans 5200 years. Non-destructive, radiological imaging approaches (X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray imaging, and CT scans) were used to assess the response of the lake system to changing hydroclimatic conditions. Variations in elemental concentrations and sediment density evidenced notable hydroclimate change episodes centered at 4850, 4200, and 3100 cal yr BP. Elevated detrital input, greater sediment density, decreased lake ventilation, and lower autochthonous productivity reflects lake deepening between 4350 and 4200 cal yr BP. An abrupt shift in elemental concentrations and sediment density indicated the onset of lake drawdown at 4200 cal yr BP and a negative hydroclimate anomaly between 4200 and 4050 cal yr BP. Lower detrital flux, decreased sediment density, increased oxygenation, and higher autochthonous productivity, reflects a reduction in lake volume between 3200 and 3100 cal yr BP. The potential link between abrupt climate change at 4200 cal yr BP and the contraction of the Indus civilization is explored.

However, the current understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns and driving factors of ARGs in waterdiversion lakes is still seriously insufficient. In the present study, we investigated antibiotic resistome in the main regulation and storage hubs, namely Nansi Lake and Dongping Lake, of the eastern part of the South-to-North Water Diversion project in Shandong Province (China) using a metagenomic-based approach. A total of 653 ARG subtypes belonging to 25 ARG types were detected with a total abundance of 0.125-0.390 copies/cell, with the dominance of bacitracin, multidrug, and macrolide-lincosamide streptogramin resistance genes. The ARG compositions were sensitive to seasonal variation and also interfered by artificial regulation structures along the way. Human pathogenic bacteria such as Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter lwoffii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, along with the multidrug resistance genes they carried, were the focus of risk control in the two studied lakes, especially in summer. Plasmids were the key mobile genetic elements (MGEs) driving the horizontal gene transfer of ARGs, especially multidrug and sulfonamide resistance genes. The null model revealed that stochastic process was the main driver of ecological drift for ARGs in the lakes. The partial least squares structural equation model further determined that seasonal changes of pH and temperature drove a shift in the bacterial community, which in turn shaped the profile of ARGs by altering the composition of MGEs, antibacterial biocide- and metalresistance genes (BMGs), and virulence factor genes (VFGs). Our results highlighted the importance of seasonal factors in determining the water transfer period. These findings can aid in a deeper understanding of the spatiotemporal variations of ARGs in lakes and their driving factors, offering a scientific basis for antibiotic resistance management.

In this study, lake surface sediment and water samples were collected from 33 terminal lakes in Western China to evaluate controls on the oxygen isotopic composition of lacustrine authigenic carbonates (delta O-18(carb)) and its spatial distribution. Our results show that water oxygen isotopic composition (delta O-18(water)) rather than lake summer water temperature (T-water), is the main determinant of delta O-18(carb), irrespective of whether oxygen isotope equilibrium is achieved. There are significant linear correlations between delta O-18(carb) and elevation, as well as that between delta O-18(carb) and latitude for lakes located on the Tibetan Plateau. In Western China, the spatial distribution of delta O-18(carb) is consistent with that of delta O-18(water), and is ultimately controlled by the isotopic composition of local precipitation (delta O-18(precipitation)) that depends on the source of water vapor. Therefore, changes in delta O-18(carb) can be predominantly interpreted as variations of delta O-18(water), which in turn represent changes in delta O-18(precipitation) for paleoclimate reconstructions in this region, and may be relevant to studies of other areas.																			2045-2322					OCT 1	2020	10	1							16370	10.1038/s41598-020-73422-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-73422-4								33005002					WOS:000577143400133

MODIS albedo data and the Great Lakes ice cover fraction dataset over the Laurentian Great Lakes were used to calibrate and validate a new parameterization of the lake albedo accounting for a partial ice cover fraction. The developments were validated for the phenology of the ice cover of 200 lakes of various sizes reported in the Global Lake and River Phenology Database. The results are in better agreement with the observations for all lake size categories, with the largest and deepest lakes showing more significant error reductions in the duration of the ice cover period up to 18 d.

We expanded the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model developed for a small Mediterranean catchment to quantify the potential effects of various climate and land use change scenarios on catchment hydrology as well as the trophic state of a new kind of waterbody, a limno-reservoir (Pareja Limno-reservoir), created for environmental and recreational purposes. We also checked for the possible synergistic effects of changes in climate and land use on water flow and nutrient exports from the catchment. Simulations showed a noticeable impact of climate change in the river flow regime and consequently the water level of the limno-reservoir, especially during summer, complicating the fulfillment of its purposes. Most of the scenarios also predicted a deterioration of trophic conditions in the limno-reservoir. Fertilization and soil erosion were the main factors affecting nitrate and total phosphorus concentrations. Combined climate and land use change scenarios showed noticeable synergistic effects on nutrients exports, relative to running the scenarios individually. While the impact of fertilization on nitrate export is projected to be reduced with warming in most cases, an additional 13% increase in the total phosphorus export is expected in the worst-case combined scenario compared to the sum of individual scenarios. Our model framework may help water managers to assess and manage how these multiple environmental stressors interact and ultimately affect aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The reason for this interference was not identified but it was dramatically reduced by heating the collection columns to 80 degrees C. Atmospheric Hg samples are currently being collected using Au-coated silica sand traps from atop 48 ft. aluminum sampling towers using an unattended and automated sampling and data recording system. We currently have approximately a two year record of TGM, beginning in the summer of 1992, for the Lake Barco Site, located in central Florida approximately 30 miles east of Gainesville, FL. The records at the south Florida sites are shorter, ranging from one month at Andytown to 16 months at both Fort Myers and Fakahatchee Strand. Average TGM concentrations (ng/m(3)) for 3 to 6 day integrated samples at the various sites are: Lake Barco, 1.59 +/- 0.58 (n=78); Fort Myers, 1.59 +/- 0.40 (n=42), Fakahatchee Strand, 1.42 +/- 0.41 (n=30); Tamiami Trail 1.46 +/- 0.80 (n=27); Everglades National Park 3.11 +/- 1.52 (n=13); and Andy Town, 1.78 +/- 0.62 (n=3). The mean Hg concentration for all the sites is 1.64 +/- 0.76 ng/m(3) (n = 191).					; Landing, William/KBA-8522-2024	Gill, Gary/0000-0002-4969-1581; 													0049-6979					FEB	1995	80	1-4					235	244		10.1007/BF01189673	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01189673													WOS:A1995RM44200028

FISHES												The effects of climate warming and eutrophication on aquatic organisms are well established, but we lack a deep understanding of the selective mechanisms of fish communities towards eutrophication and warming in tandem. The aim of the study was to identify fish traits that were positively related to eutrophication and ongoing warming. The research was conducted for 19 years in the Dnipro River channel and floodplain water system of the "Dnipro-Orylskiy" Nature Reserve. Both categorical and continuous fish traits were considered. The study area is characterized by a more intense warming trend than the average for Europe, which reflects an increase in the maximum summer air temperature. At the same time, the concentration of chlorophyll-a had a monotonic tendency to decrease during the study period. Phytophilic, limnophilic, and freshwater fish species are increasing in abundance, while rheophilic and lithophilic fish are decreasing due to global warming. Fish species with greater vulnerability and resilience have selective advantages in terms of global warming. Pelagic fish species are the most resistant to eutrophication, while benthopelagic and phytolithophilic fish species are the most sensitive. Brackish-water demersal self-settled species of marine origin have a competitive advantage over other native freshwater species in the face of increasing symptoms of eutrophication and a warming climate.

A two-dimensional hydrodynamic CE-QUAL-W2 model was configured for the Pangduo Reservoir to better understand the thermal structure and diurnal variation inside the reservoir under the local climate and hydrological conditions on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Observation data were used to verify the model, and the results showed that the average error of the 6 profile measured monthly from August to December 2016 was 0.1 degrees C, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 0.173 degrees C. The water temperature from August 2016 to September 2017 was simulated by inputting measured data as model inputs. The results revealed that the reservoir of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau was a typical dimictic reservoir and the water mixed vertically at the end of March and the end of October. During the heating period, thermal stratification occurred, with strong diurnal variation in the epilimnion. The mean variance of the diurnal water temperature was 0.10 within a 5 m water depth but 0.04 in the whole water column. The mixing mode of inflow changed from undercurrent, horizontal-invaded flow and surface layer flow in one day. In winter, the diurnal variation was weak due to the thermal protection of the ice cover, while the mean variance of diurnal water temperature was 0.00 within both 5 m and the whole water column. Compared to reservoirs in areas with low altitude but the same latitude, significant differences occurred between the temperature structure of the low-altitude reservoir and the Pangduo Reservoir (P<0.01). The Pangduo Reservoir presented a shorter stratification period and weaker stratification stability, and the annual average SI value was 26.4 kg/m(2), which was only 7.5% that of the low-altitude reservoir. The seasonal changes in the net heat flux received by the surface layers determined the seasonal cycle of stratification and mixing in reservoirs. This study provided a scientific understanding of the thermal changes in stratified reservoirs under the special geographical and meteorological conditions on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Moreover, this model can serve as a reference for adaptive management of similar dimictic reservoirs in cold and high-altitude areas.

Eduard			Nesting behavior and breeding success of Hoatzins	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												Hoatzins (Opisthocomus hoazin) are the only member of the family Opisthocomidae and are found only in forests in the Amazon and Orinoco river basin of South America. Although locally common in riparian habitats, information about their natural history is based almost exclusively on observations from gallery forests in the "llanos" (savannahs) of Venezuela. We investigated the nesting activities of Hoatzins in a primary rainforest in Amazonian Ecuador from 1995 to 2000. At our study site, Hoatzins live and breed in the inundated forests that surround lakes and river channels. Egg laying occurred from February to July and from September to November, but always peaked in April, May, and June. The mean clutch size was 2.4 +/- 1.1 eggs (N = 291; range = 1-7), but 51% of all clutches contained two eggs. The mean duration of the incubation period was 32 +/- 1.5 d (N = 20) and, overall, 17% of Hoatzin nests fledged at least one young. The main cause of nest failure was predation, with birds and snakes being the most frequent predators. Hoatzin reproduction was closely linked to the rainy season, and such timing may be influenced by increased food availability (high water levels cause leaf fall and the subsequent growth of new leaves coincides with the beginning of the feeding period of the young) and reduced risk of nest predation by mammalian predators when water levels are high. Our results indicate that the breeding biology of Hoatzins in tropical rainforest habitat, including small clutch sizes and low annual reproductive success, is similar to that of tropical passerines and provides further support for the existence of typical life history characteristics for tropical birds.

Being "sandwiched" between predators and resources, they are sensitive to changes in the environment. It has been proposed that the proportion of calanoids of total copepod abundance or biomass could be a valuable indicator of eutrophication. We investigated relationships between environmental factors and the abundance, biomass and size of calanoid and cyclopoid copepods as well as their proportions in summer in 68 Danish freshwater lakes (587 lake years) with contrasting nutrient levels and pH. When lake pH was < 6.0, mean lake depth and trophic state were the most important factors and calanoids completely dominated the copepod community. In shallow lakes with a mean depth < 2.5 m and with pH > 6.0, the proportion of calanoids in terms of biomass decreased substantially with increasing phosphorus and chlorophyll a concentrations but stayed around 50% at > 2.5 m depth irrespective of nutrient level. Time series of the lakes, recovering from eutrophication, confirmed this multi-lake pattern although the trajectory varied from lake to lake. We conclude that the proportion of calanoids in terms of biomass might be a valuable indicator of trophic state in shallow but not deep lakes and only when pH > 6.					; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019; Lauridsen, Torben/JAX-3118-2023; Sondergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019; Søndergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019; Jeppesen, Erik/A-4463-2012	Lauridsen, Torben/0000-0003-0139-2395; Sondergaard, Martin/0000-0002-1514-0482; Jeppesen, Erik/0000-0002-0542-369X													1386-2588	1573-5125				DEC	2021	55	4			SI		1241	1252		10.1007/s10452-021-09877-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-021-09877-y		JUN 2021											WOS:000661053400001

The tracer particles used in the field were: (1) 0.51 mum fluorescent microspheres, and (2) fluorescently labelled bacteria (FLB). A third type of tracer particle, natural [methyl-H-3]-thymidine-labelled bacteria (< 1.2 mum), were used as a radiotracer in a laboratory experiment. The uptake of the first two tracer-particle types was measured by microscopic examination of the rotifer guts. In the third case, the uptake of radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The rate of uptake of the microspheres decreased 10 min after the start of the experiment, probably because the gut passage time was exceeded. Using a 5 min feeding time, the rate of uptake of microspheres was higher than that of the FLB, though the variation in the uptake in both cases was high. The ingestion rates and CRs of bacteria by F. longiseta based on the fluorescent tracers were: microspheres, 5115 bact.ind-1 h-1 and 0.368 mul ind-1 h-1; FLB, 2252 bact.ind-1 h-1 and 0.162 mul ind-1 h-1. The mean CR using the thymidine-labelled natural bacteria and a 10 min feeding time was 0.179 mul ind-1 h-1. Thus, the CR based on the microsphere method was twice as high as for the other two methods.

A recovery period started in 2004 due to intense precipitation, which increased water levels in the lake. Seasonal and spatial variations of the relative abundance, population density, population structure and biomass of the zebra mussel and the relative abundance of the amphipod Chelicorophium curvispinum were monitored in the period of 2003-2005 at four different shoreline sections and in two different portions (on the bottom and near the surface portion of the rip-rap) of Lake Balaton. Along with these studies, a quantitative survey of mussel larvae found in the plankton and of the abundance of mussel feeding diving ducks were made. As a consequence of the water level fall, on the dried part of the stony littoral, numerous zebra mussel druses perished. Following the dry period in early 2004, the relative abundance of the mussel on the bottom stones was smaller than in 2003 and the bottom community was dominated by C. curvispinum. By the end of 2004 and during 2005, the water level returned to normal and the surfaces of the reinundated stones were conducive to the successful colonization of zebra mussels. Hence, they returned as the dominant fauna in 2005. The stones near the surface might provide a new substrate for the recruitment of zebra mussels, probably offering more suitable substrata for the settlement in 2005 than in 2003. Therefore, the new substrata available in 2005 may have encouraged better and more rapid zebra mussel colonization than before. Zebra mussels may be better competitors for new space than C. curvispinum. A minor change of water-level fluctuation in 2005 and the reduction in population size of the mussel feeding waterfowl could have contributed to the intensive spread of zebra mussel by 2005.					; Balogh, Csilla/N-7542-2019	Balogh, Csilla/0000-0002-5171-7680; 													0018-8158					NOV	2008	613						57	69		10.1007/s10750-008-9472-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9472-3													WOS:000258401000007

Tethered mobility and riparian resource exploitation among Neolithic hunters and herders in the Galana River basin, Kenyan coastal lowlands	ENVIRONMENTAL ARCHAEOLOGY												Human activity along the Galana River inside Tsavo National Park, Kenya extends from 6000 years BP until at least 1300 years BP. This time period in East Africa predates and includes the Pastoral Neolithic - geographically and temporally linked early cattle-herding cultures comprised of autonomous communities with loose cultural connections to one another. Data from some sites located in the Great Rift Valley, Lake Victoria Basin and Central Kenyan Highlands indicate that after 3000 years BP, residential mobility patterns increased and pastoralists adopted a strong dependence on maintaining and culling herds of domesticated animals. This pattern is not borne out in Tsavo, where artefact analyses indicate that people had restricted mobility and relied primarily on exploitation of an endoaquatic resource base. This study hypothesises that subdecadal periodicity in El Nino/Southern Oscillation index (ENSO) along with a general trend toward aridification of East African landscapes provided the environmental backdrop for a subsistence regime focused primarily within riparian environments of the Coastal Lowlands region.					; Wright, David/H-3311-2019	Wright, David K./0000-0003-1704-0423; 													1461-4103	1749-6314				APR	2007	12	1					25	47		10.1179/174963107x172732	http://dx.doi.org/10.1179/174963107x172732													WOS:000208881900002

In this paper emphasis is put on the NOPEX experiences with respect to the spatial integration of fluxes of momentum, heat, humidity and CO2 over the mosaic of forest, agricultural land, lakes and mires that make up the southern part of the NOPEX area. It is found that the forest dominates both the regional momentum and heat fluxes but in very different ways. Furthermore, results from a NOPEX experiment in the northern zone of the boreal forest in Finnish Lapland highlights the very unique processes associated with the energy exchange within a forest in wintertime. The interaction of the forest canopy with sunshine provides a considerable energy source, particularly at low solar angles. A considerable improvement in model simulations of fluxes and surface temperature was achieved when this effect and the heat storage of the canopy were taken into account.

The moment magnitude of the event was reported as 6.8. This paper documents reconnaissance findings performed immediately after the event. Investigated sites namely, Lake Hazar shores, Karakaya Dam Reservoir-Euphrates River shores, Malatya-Battalgazi district and its villages, and Elazig Downtown are predicted to be shaken by rock peak ground acceleration, PGA(VS30=1100 m/s), levels of 0.12-0.42 g, 0.05-0.11 g, 0.05 g, and 0.08 g respectively. The documented geotechnical field performances vary from widespread liquefaction-induced sand boils and lateral spreading, to no signs of surface manifestations of permanent ground deformations or soil liquefaction. In Battalgazi district and Elazig Downtown, the foundation performances vary from no signs of permanent ground deformations to 1-3 cm settlements, and 1-2 cm lateral movements. Additionally, the hydraulic structures inspected are estimated to be shaken by PGA(VS30=1100 m/s) levels of 0.03-0.23 g. Other than a minor longitudinal cracking along a limited section along the crest of a homogeneous earthfill dam, no apparent signs of permanent ground deformations were reported. Last but not least, a number of rock falls were mapped, based on back analyses of which probable peak ground velocities at these rockfall sites were speculated.

Climate Change Effects on Runoff, Catchment Phosphorus Loading and Lake Ecological State, and Potential Adaptations	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Climate change may have profound effects on phosphorus (P) transport in streams and on take eutrophication. Phosphorus loading from land to streams is expected to increase in northern temperate coastal regions due to higher winter rainfall and to a decline in warm temperate and and climates. Model results suggest a 3.3 to 16.5% increase within the next 100 yr in the P loading of Danish streams depending on soil type and region. In takes, higher eutrophication can be expected, reinforced by temperature-mediated higher P release from the sediment. Furthermore, a shift in fish community structure toward small and abundant plankti-benthivorous fish enhances predator control of zooplankton, resulting in higher phytoplankton biomass. Data from Danish lakes indicate increased chlorophyll a and phytoplankion biomass, higher dominance of dinophytes and cyanobacteria (most notably of nitrogen fixing forms), but lower abundance of diatoms and chrysophytes, reduced size of copepods and cladocerans, and a tendency to reduced zooplankton biomass and zooplankton:phytoplankton biomass ratio when lakes warm. Higher P concentrations are also seen in warm and lakes despite reduced external loading due to increased evapotranspiration and reduced inflow. Therefore, the critical loading for good ecological state in lakes has to be lowered in a future warmer climate. This calls for adaptation measures, which in the northern temperate zone should include improved P cycling in agriculture, reduced loading from point sources, and (re)-establishment of wetlands and riparian buffer zones. In the arid Southern Europe, restrictions on human use of water are also needed, not least on irrigation.					; Sondergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019; Søndergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019; özen, arda/ABH-2224-2020; Lauridsen, Torben/JAX-3118-2023; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019; beklioglu, meryem/ABA-1630-2020; kronvang, brian/I-7715-2013; Olesen, Jørgen/Y-2857-2019; Jeppesen, Erik/A-4463-2012	Lauridsen, Torben/0000-0003-0139-2395; Sondergaard, Martin/0000-0002-1514-0482; Olesen, Jorgen E./0000-0002-6639-1273; Andersen, Hans Estrup/0000-0003-2465-583X; Jeppesen, Erik/0000-0002-0542-369X													0047-2425	1537-2537				SEP-OCT	2009	38	5					1930	1941		10.2134/jeq2008.0113	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2008.0113								19704137					WOS:000269627400018
J	MERO, F; SIMON, E				MERO, F; SIMON, E			THE SIMULATION OF CHLORIDE INFLOWS INTO LAKE KINNERET	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												It is necessary to operate Lake Kinneret in the future according to revised policies. This has required development of a tool which permits a forecast of the effect of the revised operating rules on the quality and quantity of available water for direct consumption from the lake. For this purpose, a combined daily water and chloride inflow simulation model, M8KNRT, was developed. This paper presents a description of the model, which is based on the inverse relationship between water inflows to Lake Kinneret from saline springs and ground water, and their chloride contribution to the lake. This concept, implying that fresh aquifer heads and discharges regulate the brine fluxes, is the most important feature of the M8KNRT model. The excellent results achieved following calibration of the model based on simulation of water and chloride inflows to Lake Kinneret, and on chloride concentrations in the lake confirm its validity for use in future forecasts under different operating conditions within the lake watershed. The model is structured in general form, allowing it to be applied to any other lake with similar problems.																			0022-1694					OCT	1992	138	3-4					345	360		10.1016/0022-1694(92)90125-F	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(92)90125-F													WOS:A1992JW46700002

Molecular tests revealed the presence of the DNA of an unknown fish herpesvirus. Three genes encoding the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, major capsid protein and ATPase subunit of terminase were amplified and sequenced from the alloherpesviral genome. The gene sequences of the viruses obtained from the two different fish species shared 94.4% nucleotide sequence identity (98.1% amino acid sequence identity), suggesting that they belong to the same virus species. Phylogenetic analysis based on the DNA polymerase (and the concatenated sequences of the amplified genes, as well) implied that the detected virus belongs to the genus Cyprinivirus within the family Alloherpesviridae. The sequences of the novel alloherpesvirus diverge from those of the five cyprinivirus species described previously, so it putatively represents the sixth virus species in the genus.

J	Benzie, JAH; Hodges, AMA				Benzie, JAH; Hodges, AMA			Daphnia obtusa Kurz, 1874 emend Scourfield, 1942 from Australia	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Specimens of Daphnia found in Lake Burley Griffin in December 1994 (austral summer), were taken into laboratory culture where males and ephippial females were generated. All the key morphological features of the females, males and ephippia (resting eggs) fitted those described for Daphnia obtusa Kurz, 1874 emend Scourfield, 1942 not yet recorded from Australia. There were major differences between the specimens from Lake Burley Griffin and descriptions of D, jollyi, the only other species from the subgenus Daphnia in Australia which has a fringe of long setae in the mid-region of the ventral margin of the carapace. In addition, D. jollyi is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. The discovery of D. obtusa does not provide evidence for the existence of this taxon in Australia since the breakup of Gondwana in the Cretaceous. Its discovery in an artificial lake opened in 1964, and which has been extensively sampled without detection of this species over the last 10-20 years, suggests a recent introduction from overseas.

THE EFFECT OF LANDSCAPE PATTERN IN RESPONSE TO ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE CHANGE IN XIAOXING'ANLING, HEILONGJIANG PROVINCE, CHINA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Wetlands play an important role in conserving water sources, regulating climate, and protecting biodiversity and have extremely high ecological value. However, global natural wetlands are rapidly degrading. Therefore, protecting wetlands is of strategic importance for ensuring ecological and environmental security. Based on the Landsat remote sensing images from 1975 to 2015 and the monthly meteorological data during the same periods, this study analyzed the landscape pattern change and explored the relationship with climate change and wetland change in Xiaoxing'anling, using the methods of landscape ecology and mathematical statistics. The results showed that the degree of landscape fragmentation was unused land < water area < forest land < urban land < cultivated land < wetland and the number of patches had increasing trend. The wetlands were mainly converted into cultivated land and the wetland areas have significantly degraded in the past 40 years in Xiaoxing'anling. The change of landscape diversity had a close correlation with annual precipitation and average summer precipitation. This study provides a theoretical basis for regional wetland protection.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2019	17	6					15419	15429		10.15666/aeer/1706_1541915429	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1706_1541915429													WOS:000505251300189

Vegetation and Land use Impact on Water Loss Rate in Playas of the Southern High Plains, USA	WETLANDS												Playa wetlands in the Southern High Plains provide services such as stormwater storage, groundwater recharge, and biodiversity provisioning. However, watershed erosion has negatively impacted these services. Previously, we demonstrated that water loss rate was influenced by land use variables such as watershed cultivation (tilled index) and playa volume loss (hydric soil defined wetland volume). Because non-anthropogenic water loss in playas is limited to evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration processes, our objective was to determine the impact of wetland vegetation characteristics and land use variables on water loss rate in playa wetlands. We recorded water levels of 70 playas through the summers of 2003 and 2004 and determined the relationship between water loss rate and predictive variables including local playa characteristics, vegetation (structure and cover of functional groups), bi-weekly starting water levels, and watershed soil texture. Playa volume loss was a positive predictor of water loss rate, suggesting infiltration may be greater in playas with more sediment. Water loss rate was lower in playas in the fine-textured zone, but was not influenced by wetland vegetation. To complete quantification of the hydrologic budget of playa wetlands, future studies should focus on the influence of sedimentation on infiltration and recharge.					; Tsai, Jo-Szu/C-6576-2009	Tsai, Jo-Szu/0000-0002-9936-7333; 													0277-5212	1943-6246				DEC	2010	30	6					1107	1116		10.1007/s13157-010-0117-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-010-0117-8													WOS:000285095400010

The importance of groundwater flow to the formation of modern thrombolitic microbialites	GEOBIOLOGY												Modern microbialites are often located within groundwater discharge zones, yet the role of groundwater in microbialite accretion has yet to be resolved. To understand relationships between groundwater, microbialites, and associated microbial communities, we quantified and characterized groundwater flow and chemistry in active thrombolitic microbialites in Lake Clifton, Western Australia, and compared these observations to inactive thrombolites and lakebed sediments. Groundwater flows upward through an interconnected network of pores within the microstructure of active thrombolites, discharging directly from thrombolite heads into the lake. This upwelling groundwater is fresher than lake water and is hypothesized to support microbial mat growth by reducing salinity and providing limiting nutrients in an osmotically stressful and oligotrophic habitat. This is in contrast to inactive thrombolites that show no evidence of microbial mat colonization and are infiltrated by hypersaline lake water. Groundwater discharge through active thrombolites contrasts with the surrounding lakebed, where hypersaline lake water flows downward through sandy sediments at very low rates. Based on an appreciation for the role of microorganisms in thrombolite accretion, our findings suggest conditions favorable to thrombolite formation still exist in certain locations of Lake Clifton despite increasing lake water salinity. This study is the first to characterize groundwater flow rates, paths, and chemistry within a microbialite-forming environment and provides new insight into how groundwater can support microbial mats believed to contribute to microbialite formation in modern and ancient environments.

Magnetotactic bacteria from Pavilion Lake, British Columbia	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Pavilion Lake is a slightly alkaline, freshwater lake located in British Columbia, Canada (50 degrees 51'N, 121 degrees 44'W). It is known for unusual organosedimentary structures, called microbialites that are found along the lake basin. These deposits are complex associations of fossilized microbial communities and detrital- or chemical-sedimentary rocks. During the summer, a sediment sample was collected from near the lake's shore, approximately 25-50 cm below the water surface. Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) were isolated from this sample using a simple magnetic enrichment protocol. The MTB isolated from Pavilion Lake belonged to the Alphaproteobacteria class as determined by nucleotide sequences of 16S rRNA genes. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the bacteria were spirillum-shaped and contained a single chain of cuboctahedral-shaped magnetite (Fe3O4) crystals that were approximately 40 nm in diameter. This discovery of MTB in Pavilion Lake offers an opportunity to better understand the diversity of MTB habitats, the geobiological function of MTB in unique freshwater ecosystems, and search for magnetofossils contained within the lake's microbialites.					; Lower, Steven/A-2440-2008	Oestreicher, Zachery/0000-0001-5887-653X; Lower, Steven/0000-0001-9796-0830; Lower, Brian/0000-0002-2581-548X; 													1664-302X					DEC 20	2013	4								406	10.3389/fmicb.2013.00406	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2013.00406								24391636					WOS:000331555600001

Regulated Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometry Detectible Elements in Utah Lake: Characterization and Discussion	WATER												During the 2021 (n = 15) and 2022 (n = 13) summers, we measured the total and dissolved (<0.45 mu m) concentration of 25 elements in Utah Lake using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) with detection limits in the order of a few parts-per-billion (ppb). This resulted in 1400 measurements, which is a unique dataset in terms of sensitivity and temporal resolution. Regulated elements are not commonly measured at the ppb-level; thus, these data provide insight into both the behavior and existence of these elements in an aquatic environment and have implications for both the management and regulation of the lake. Utah regulates twelve of these elements. While ICP-OES has ppb-level sensitivity, it is not the approved regulatory analysis method for these elements. All regulations are for dissolved concentrations, except aluminum (Al) and phosphorus (P), which are for total recovery. We found total Al above the allowable concentration, but dissolved concentrations were well below allowable concentrations. We attribute high total concentrations to suspended clays. This suggests that regulatory methods should be reviewed for lakes with a high suspended-solid content. Dissolved copper (Cu) concentrations were below regulatory levels in 2021, but some samples were above regulatory levels in 2022. This could be related to the use of Cu-based algaecide treatments, or from other sources. Lead (Pb) data were inconclusive; dissolved Pb concentrations were well below the acute (1 h average) limit, but the chronic concentration limit (4 h average) was below the ICP-OES minimal detection limit. Arsenic (As) concentrations exhibited a seasonal trend that we attribute to groundwater inflows-they were below regulatory levels for aquatic environments but around the levels for drinking water. This ppb-level study with high temporal resolution provides insight into regulated elements in Utah Lake previously not available due to the high sensitivity of the method and measurements of both total and dissolved concentrations.

In Yunnan Province of south-eastern China major lakes and their catchments such as Dian Lake basin in the vicinity of the Provincial capital Kunming were also preferred for early settlements. Here we reconstructed hydrological conditions of the lake and parts of its catchment in combination with early human occupation during the last 6 cal. ka BP and focused on the Dian culture (Bronze Age) and succeeding Han Dynasty. We mainly used sediment composition in the lake and on land to infer transportation processes related to climate controlled hydrological variations and combined them with past human occupation in response to groundwater fluctuations and resulting settlements and land use. Our results show that Dian Lake experienced several low lake level stages between 4.5 and 1.0 cal. ka BP (negative hydrological balance) due to deteriorated monsoon climate impact, but also indicate high-frequency flood-drought events. Lowered groundwater levels enabled human cultures to settle at low-terrain sites during the late Neolithic, Bronze Age (Dian culture), and early Chinese empires. Different from other regions in eastern Asia the local cultures adapted to climate deterioration and made use of extended arable land and intensified harvest of aquatic gastropods.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				AUG	2020	587								124932	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124932	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124932													WOS:000568819100016

Yet, it is poorly known how humans have influenced fire regimes prior to active wildfire suppression. Among the last 250 years, the human contribution to the global increase in fire occurrence during the mid-19th century is especially unclear, as data sources are limited. Here, we test the extent to which forest management has driven fire regime shifts in a temperate forest landscape. We combine multiple fire proxies (macroscopic charcoal and fire-related biomarkers) derived from highly resolved lake sediments (i.e., 3-5 years per sample), and apply a new statistical approach to classify source area- and temperature-specific fire regimes (biomass burnt, fire episodes). We compare these records with independent climate and vegetation reconstructions. We find two prominent fire regime shifts during the 19th and 20th centuries, driven by an adaptive socio-ecological cycle in human forest management. Although individual fire episodes were triggered mainly by arson (as described in historical documents) during dry summers, the biomass burnt increased unintentionally during the mid-19th century due to the plantation of flammable, fast-growing pine tree monocultures needed for industrialization. State forest management reacted with active fire management and suppression during the 20th century. However, pine cover has been increasing since the 1990s and climate projections predict increasingly dry conditions, suggesting a renewed need for adaptations to reduce the increasing fire risk.

Habitats colonized by non-native flowering rush Butomus umbellatus (Linnaeus, 1753) in the Niagara River, USA	AQUATIC INVASIONS												During the summer of 2012, we first observed non-native flowering rush Butomus umbellatus (Linnaeus, 1753) in the upper Niagara River, NY, USA, where this species had previously been undocumented. In a 2013 study, Butomus was present at 33 of 161 (20%) submersed nearshore (<= 3 m) sites surveyed. It was the species of greatest biomass at 27% of the sites where it was collected, and was observed growing at depths > 3 m. Butomus was disproportionately prevalent in the upper observed ranges of water depth and velocity. Butomus was also closely associated with coarse substrates, differing from canopy-forming species but not other linear-leaved species. Emergence of Butomus from the sediment generally occurred from late-May to early-June, with peak coverage and height occurring in mid-to late-July. Coverage was generally minimal by mid-September. Rhizome bulbil production occurred on specimens as small as 25 cm in length and was first observed in mid-August when water temperatures were about 22.5 degrees C. Although we did not investigate the ploidy status of Butomus in the Niagara River, the presence of these vegetative reproductive structures is consistent with reports of genetically diploid Butomus populations in North America. No linear correlations between the biomasses of Butomus and other species were detected, although the data suggest a possible limiting effect on the biomasses of other species in dense Butomus stands. Even if emergent Butomus was eradicated from shorelines and wetlands, submersed areas would likely act as a refuge from which Butomus could continue to distribute viable bulbils and rhizome fragments into the nearshore. Submersed Butomus is a potential ecosystem engineer because it can colonize barren areas with coarse substrates, reach high densities, and grow to a considerable height in the water column. Subsequently, deposition and retention of fine sediments may occur, potentially allowing other species to expand into previously unsuitable areas.																			1798-6540	1818-5487				OCT	2016	11	4					369	380		10.3391/ai.2016.11.4.03	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/ai.2016.11.4.03													WOS:000385925200003

A preliminary study of the stratigraphic context of these tracks indicates that they were made by gregarious subadult or adult dinosaurs that frequented lake basin settings subject to a cyclic depositional regime and periodic ash fall. Bird and theropod dinosaur tracks also occur in the sequence. Mapped sites reveal between 4 and 14 regularly spaced, ornithopod trackways suggestive of herding behavior. One site reveals an 84 m-long trackway, the longest on record for an ornithopod. Only one site reveals parallel sauropod trackways indicating three animals of equal size traveling eastwards with an inter-trackway spacing of about 2.25-2.5 m. The footprints show well preserved pes claw impressions, slightly wide gauge and largemanus/pes ratios ( low heteropody). The sedimentological and ichnofaunal sequences share some similarities with the famous Jindong successions 50 km to the east, but they also differ significantly in age and ichnofaunal composition.																			1042-0940						2012	19	1-2			SI		105	114		10.1080/10420940.2011.625793	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10420940.2011.625793													WOS:000303566700012

The data were collected at 664 sites at 23 different water types such as springs, streams, rivers, canals, ditches, lakes, and pools in The Netherlands. By training the CPN, the sampling sites were classified into five groups and the classification was mainly related to pollution status and habitat type of the sampling sites. By visualizing environmental variables and diversity indices on the map of the trained model, the relationships between variables were evaluated. The trained CPN serves as a 'look-up table' for finding the corresponding values between environmental variables and community indices. The output of the model fitted SH and SR well showing a high accuracy of the prediction (r > 0.90 and 0.67 for learning and testing process, respectively) for both SH and SR. Finally, the results of this study, which uses the capability of the CPN for patterning and predicting ecological data, suggest that the CPN can be effectively used as a tool for assessing ecological status and predicting water quality of target ecosystems.

In Lake Vilar, Chromatium spp. was dominant (up to 92% of the microbial biovolume). In Lake Ciso, the predominant microorganisms were Chromatium spp. (up to 71%) and another purple sulfur bacterium forming aggregates (20%). The bacterial layer could be divided according to the physiological state of the cells into a top part of maximal specific activity, a peak of maximal abundance, and a bottom part of inactive cells. The bacteria in the peak were predominantly limited by light; sulfide, phosphate, and acetate were not limiting in the middle of the day. The light limitation started at the depth having the maximal concentration of cells; the top of the layer appeared to be sulfide-limited. Specific contents of photopigments, elemental sulfur, and reserve polymers decreased from the top to the bottom of the bacterial layer. These phenomena point to the crucial role of light in the development of layers of phototrophic bacteria in stratified lakes.

One of the main threats resulting from human impact is eutrophication due to agriculture, catchment urbanization and recreational use. In this paper, changes in the water chemistry and transformation of biocoenoses of one of the largest Polish SLI, Lake Jeleri, over the past 30 years are presented. The lake is located within the borders of a city, and a significant part of its catchment is under agriculture and recreation use. The physicochemical (concentration of nutrients, organic matter, electrical conductivity, oxygen saturation and water pH) and biological parameters (macrophytes and phytoplankton) were measured in summer 1991, 2004, 2013 and 2018. Since the beginning of the 1990s, a gradual increase in the trophy of the lake has been observed as indicated by increased nutrient availability, deterioration of oxygen conditions and a decrease in water transparency. The alterations of water chemistry induce biological transformations, in particular, an increase in phytoplankton abundance (4-fold increase of biomass in epilimnion) as well as a gradual reduction in the range of the phytolittoral (from 10 to 6 m), a decrease in the frequency of isoetids, Lobelia dortmanna and Isoetes lacustris, and expansion of plant species characteristic for eutrophy.					; Rosinska, Joanna/J-2864-2012	Szelag-Wasielewska, Elzbieta/0000-0002-7542-6490; Piotrowicz, Ryszard/0000-0001-7890-0840; Borowiak, Dariusz/0000-0002-3823-1176; Rosinska, Joanna/0000-0002-8443-7546; Klimaszyk, Piotr/0000-0003-2847-1106														2073-4441				APR	2020	12	4							945	10.3390/w12040945	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12040945													WOS:000539527500022

We examined mayfly assemblage taxonomy, functional feeding groups and microhabitat preferences in two contrasting lotic Dinaric karst catchments, one pristine and one anthropogenically impacted. At monthly intervals over a one-year period, all major microhabitats (i.e. dominated by boulders, cobbles, sand, silt, mosses, or angiosperms) were sampled at sites spanning springs, upper, middle and lower river reaches, and tufa barriers. In both catchments, mayfly species richness was comparable among microhabitats, while mayfly abundance was highest on mosses and lowest on silt. NMDS ordination did not group assemblages according to microhabitat type, which may reflect the greater influence of physical and chemical water properties. In both catchments and all microhabitats, mayfly assemblages were dominated by grazers/scrapers at upstream sites and by detritivores at downstream sites. Active filter feeders were more abundant in microhabitats with silt substrates and lower current velocities. This study demonstrated that certain mayfly species strongly preferred a specific microhabitat type, reflecting their water current preferences and feeding strategies, while other species shifted between microhabitats, likely in search of food resources and shelter. The results emphasize the importance of habitat heterogeneity in supporting diverse communities in karst rivers.

Twenty-eight modern samples collected in moss polsters from 800 and 5400 m a.s.l. are used for palynological analysis. Our results indicate that palynological assemblages and indicator species from moss polsters can reflect the vertical distribution of vegetation belts. Abies, Picea and Pinus pollen from the upper forests and shrub meadow elements (Ericaceae, Cyperaceae and Polygonum) show strong abilities to be transported upward, whereas pollen (e.g. Macaranga, Alnus and Rutaceae) and spore (e.g. Athyrium, Cyatheaceae, Dicranopteris, Pteris) taxa from the lower evergreen forests show weak abilities to be transported upward. An unusual finding is that Tsuga pollen from the lower coniferous forest tends to be transported downslope, probably due to the intense spring rainfall and associated surface runoff in the study area. Due to its potential impact on the geographic range shifts of plants, pollen dispersal may be an additional factor to be considered in studies of vegetation change in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, such as the projection of Abies or Picea treeline under climate warming. Furthermore, the redundancy analysis shows that precipitation and wind speed are the main factors influencing pollen distribution in the study area.					; huang, lei/GQP-8739-2022; Zhu, Liping/J-9352-2019; Wang, Junbo/IVH-8446-2023	Zhu, Liping/0000-0002-4234-8748; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2023	154								110867	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110867	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110867		AUG 2023											WOS:001069033600001

Input and occurrence in rivers and lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The complexing agents benzotriazole (BT) and tolyltriazole (TT) are not only widely applied as anticorrosives, e. g., in aircraft deicer and anti-icer fluid (ADAF), but they are also used for so-called silver protection in dishwasher detergents. Due to their low biodegradability and limited sorption tendency, BT and TT are only partly removed in wastewater treatment. Residual concentrations of BT and TT were determined in ambient surface waters in Switzerland including 7 rivers which have distinct water flows and receive treated wastewater effluents at various dilution ratios. A maximum BT concentration of 6.3 mu g/L was found in the Glatt River, and a maximum mass flow of 277 kg BT per week was observed in the Rhine River. In most cases, TT was about a factor 5-10 less abundant. During winter 2003/4, BT mass flows at 2 locations in the lower stretch of the Glatt River clearly indicated the input from nearby Zurich airport, where BT was applied as an anticorrosive ADAF component. BT concentrations measured in the three lakes Greifensee, Lake Zurich, and Lake Geneva were approximately 1.2, 0.1-0.4, and 0.2 mu g/L, respectively. The observed environmental occurrences indicate that BT and TT are ubiquitous contaminants in the aquatic environment and that they belong to the most abundant individual water pollutants.

Diet and growth of northern pike in the absence of prey fishes: Initial consequences for persisting in disturbance-prone lakes	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The northern pike Esox lucius is a renowned piscivore, but will prey opportunistically on invertebrates (e.g., in small lakes of boreal Alberta, where winterkill can unexpectedly reduce or eliminate prey fishes). We emulated such a disturbance by stocking a fishless lake with northern pike and then monitored their diet and growth over two summers. Stomach content analysis revealed that stocked adults responded to the sudden absence of prey fishes by specializing on energy-rich leeches (families Glossiphomidae and Erpobdellidae), whereas juvenile offspring consumed a broader mix of invertebrates. Stable isotope analysis supported these results and indicated a relatively rapid drop in the trophic position of stocked adults. Compared with growth of northern pike in regional lakes containing prey fishes, growth of adults in the experimental lake was apparently compromised by a diet of invertebrates but growth of juveniles was high. Although long-term dynamics of northern pike in these disturbance-prone lakes are undocumented, our results suggest that northern pike are capable of adapting rapidly to the absence of prey fishes; however, such a diet imposes a trophic bottleneck that can lead to stunting.

Fourteen marine alga layers were deposited in the beach with an altitude of 2.80 m, and one diatom layer deposited in the ancient lake on the terrace with an altitude of 6.84 m. A radiocarbon age of 695 +/- 70 aBP was obtained for the modem marine alga, and the age was used in correction for the carbon reservoir effect of the marine alga.

J	Pe-Piper, G				Pe-Piper, G			Mode of occurrence, chemical variation and genesis of mordenite and associated zeolites from the Morden area, Nova Scotia, Canada	CANADIAN MINERALOGIST												Selected zoned and homogeneous amygdales and veins of zeolite from the earliest Jurassic North Mountain Basalt, in Nova Scoria, have been examined in thin section and by SEM, XRD and electron-microprobe analysis. Zoned sequences of zeolites in amygdales and veins in the North Mountain basalt show a succession of clinoptilolite-Na --> mordenite --> heulandite, clinoptilolite-Ca, or epistilbite --> stilbite, barrerite, or stellerite, and are interpreted as developing under falling temperatures. Locally, fractures within zeolites have been filled with smectite and at least three different Mg-Fe-Na-aluminosilicates. Barite, Cu, Ni and Au precipitates occur throughout some zoned amygdales. The high temperatures required for the precipitation of labradorite and mordenite, the repetitive zonation in some amygdales, and the occurrence of metal precipitates all suggest an origin for the zeolites by active hydrothermal circulation, not by burial metamorphism as implied by previous authors. Formation of mordenite was favored by hydrothermal circulation of alkaline lake waters and extraction of Na from underlying evaporites of the Blomidon Formation.																			0008-4476					OCT	2000	38		5				1215	1232		10.2113/gscanmin.38.5.1215	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/gscanmin.38.5.1215													WOS:000166016200011

Stock-recruitment dynamics of a freshwater clupeid	FISHERIES RESEARCH												The clupeid gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum is often the most abundant fish species in North American reservoirs, and this dominance can have cascading trophic effects on entire fish assemblages. Accordingly, a key aspect of managing reservoir fish assemblages involves controlling gizzard shad densities. We used a 33-year time series to evaluate the relative importance of parental stock density, winter temperature, and water regime on recruitment of age-0 gizzard shad in a large reservoir. Recruitment modeled with a Ricker-type curve increased with the size of the adult stock, peaked, and then decreased at high stock densities. This over-compensatory stock-recruitment relationship was made more dynamic by fluctuations in inflow, with recruitment increasing in years of high inflow, however there was no temperature effect at the latitude of the study site. The influence of stock size on recruitment was roughly twice as high as the influence of inflow. This study is the first to report stock-recruitment relationships for a clupeid species in a reservoir and concurs with analyses of marine fishes that have shown that most clupeids exhibit compensatory or over-compensatory patterns in their stock-recruitment relationships.					norris, david/IWU-9151-2023	Faucheux, Nicky/0000-0002-5489-3268; Miranda, Leandro/0000-0002-2138-7924													0165-7836	1872-6763				JAN	2020	221								105378	10.1016/j.fishres.2019.105378	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2019.105378													WOS:000496874700013

They are one of the most productive environments and cradles for biological diversity. They are considered as wealth of carbon storage and provide a potential sink for global atmospheric carbon, but the role of the wetlands in carbon sequestration storage has been under estimated. The recent increase in the atmospheric carbon dioxide has led to growing concern among the public and scientific community to identify the potential of various ecosystem to sequester more carbon. There is growing interest among researchers to adhere to the Kyoto Protocol to stabilize the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide and global warming through managing wetland restoration and conservation projects to exploit the carbon sequestration potential. The objective of the present study is to assess the soil organic carbon (SOC) in different sites of Loktak Lake to estimate the carbon stock and provide their potential of carbon sequestration capacity. The result from the analysis of SOC density ranges from 0.70kg/m(2) to 6.57kg/m(2) at a depth of 0 ... 10 cm and density varies during the season with maximum SOC of 5.18kg/m(2) during post monsoon and 3.19kg/m(2) during winter. The total carbon sequestration potential of the Loktak Lake is 204181 tones year(-1). The outcome from the study will help in formulation of efficient strategies to mitigate the increase in carbon dioxide and reduction of the GHG emissions from wetlands in the Indo-Burma (Myanmar) Biodiversity Hotspot.

The redescription includes data on the habitat, abundance, morphology, infraciliature, and ultrastructure. Ascobius lentus was rediscovered in high numbers on artificial substrate in the eutrophic lake "Alte Kiesgrube" near Grietherbusch, Germany, during the summer months. The genus is characterized by a simple, lying, flat lorica without flaps or chambers, short, broad and flexible peristomial wings, a paroral kinety closely apposed to the adoral zone of membranelles (AZM), a compact macronucleus, and a spatulate or broadened holdfast organelle. Ascobius lentus is the type species and the only so far described freshwater species of the genus. It differs from marine species especially by its highly vacuolated anterior part; the network of vacuoles is probably an osmoregulatory oganelle. The macronucleus of A. lentus is surrounded by a filamentous network that has not yet been described in other folliculinid species. In summary, Ascobius has a unique combination of morphological and ultrastructural features which justifies, at the present state of knowledge, its classification in a separate genus.

Most lakes in northern Maine had three to seven minnow species, constituting 40-80% of species in each lake. Lakes in New Jersey, southern New York, and southern New England rarely had minnows, other than golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas). Lakes in the Adirondacks and the remainder of northern New England had intermediate numbers. We examined minnow native ranges and autecology and evaluated species richness related to littoral predators and human disturbance. Sample data suggested alteration in the minnow assemblages over much of the region. The most consistent factor related to minnow species richness was the presence of littoral predators. Median number of minnow species was two in lakes lacking predators and zero in lakes with predators. Non-native predators, especially Micropterus spp., have been introduced throughout the Northeast; 69% of the sampled lakes had non-native predators. In the absence of predators, minnow species declined with increased human activity in the watershed and along lake shorelines. Only in northern Maine did lake minnow assemblages seem relatively intact.																			0706-652X					JUL	1997	54	7					1593	1607		10.1139/cjfas-54-7-1593	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-54-7-1593													WOS:A1997XW70100015

However, the northwest of the AP showed a cooling from 2000 to 2015, which had local consequences with an increase in snow accumulation and a deceleration in the loss of mass from glaciers. In this paper, we studied the effects of increased snow accumulation in the permafrost thermal regime in two boreholes (PG1 and PG2) in Livingston Island, South Shetlands Archipelago, from 2009 to 2015. The two boreholes located c. 300 m apart but at similar elevation showed different snow accumulation, with PG2 becoming completely covered with snow all year long, while the other remained mostly snow free during the summer. The analysis of the thermal regimes and of the estimated soil surface energy exchange during the study period showed the effects of snow insulation in reducing the active layer thickness. These effects were especially relevant in PG2, which transitioned from a subaerial to a subnival regime. There, permafrost aggraded from below, with the active layer completely disappearing and the efficiency of thermal insulation by the snowpack prevailing in the thermal regime. This situation may be used as an analogue for the transition from a periglacial to a subglacial environment in longer periods of cooling in the paleoenvironmental record.

Most research has targeted outcrops or moderately to deeply buried MTDs and, therefore, the petrophysical properties of near-seafloor MTDs, and their influence in the trapping and release of shallow fluids, is poorly studied. Here, we investigate shallow MTDs in Lake Villarrica (Chile) by combining sub-bottom profiles, free-fall penetrometer data, pore pressure dissipation tests and geotechnical properties of sediment cores. Low undrained shear strength under a surficial MTD indicates underconsolidation caused by sudden loading and rapid sealing. Larger, buried MTDs show acoustic signatures of free gas at their base, indicating effective sealing. This is supported by degassing core gaps just below MTDs and by excess pore pressure ratios c. 30-70% within MTDs. Acoustic windows below rafted blocks suggest local fluid escape. MTDs exhibit elevated undrained shear strength and reduced porosity compared to surrounding sediments, but are comparable to upslope source sequences. This suggests that MTD sealing capacity in Villarrica relates to the apparently overconsolidated nature of the slope sequence, leaving a minor role for shear densification. This study shows that shallow MTDs can form a relatively rapid seal for fluid migration, locally degraded by rafted blocks.

They are extremely abundant and diverse in South America, where the oldest otophysans and siluriforms occur. We restudied two putative catfish species from the early Eocene lacustrine Tufolitas Laguna del Hunco of northwestern Patagonia, Argentina, concluding that Arius argentinus Dolgopol, 1941, is a junior synonym of Bachmannia chubutensis Dolgopol, 1941. Phylogenetic analyses were performed to show the relationships of B. chubutensis, which appears as the sister group of Diplomystes. Bachmannia chubutensis is one of the most primitive catfishes known and we based on it a new family. The family is clearly diagnosed by the presence of a anterior ventrolateral expansion of cleithrum, short maxilla with two rows of teeth, double-headed autopalatine, accessory tooth plates, very huge teeth, supraoccipital process long and acute, first and fifth vertebrae not joined to complex vertebra, neural arch of fifth and sixth vertebrae very well developed, enlarged supraneural 5, suture between ceratohyal and epihyal without interdigitations, suture between contralateral cleithra and coracoids without interdigitations, six hypurals.

J	Gao, J				Gao, Jay			Bathymetric mapping by means of remote sensing: methods, accuracy and limitations	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT												Bathymetry has been traditionally charted via shipboard echo sounding. Alhough able to generate accurate depth measurements at points or along transects, this method is constrained by its high operating cost, inefficiency, and inapplicability to shallow waters. By comparison, remote sensing methods offer more flexible, efficient and cost-effective means of mapping bathymetry over broad areas. Remote sensing of bathymetry falls into two broad categories: non-imaging and imaging methods. The non-imaging method (as typified by LIDAR) is able to produce accurate bathymetric information over clear waters at a depth up to 70 m. However, this method is limited by the coarse bathymetric sampling interval and high cost. The imaging method can be implemented either analytically or empirically, or by a combination of both. Analytical or semi-analytical implementation is based on the manner of light transmission in water. It requires inputs of a number of parameters related to the properties of the atmosphere, water column, and bottom material. Thus, it is rather complex and difficult to use. By comparison, empirical implementation is much simpler and requires the input of fewer parameters. Both implementations can produce fine-detailed bathymetric maps over extensive turbid coastal and inland lake waters quickly, even though concurrent depth samples are essential. The detectable depth is usually limited to 20 m. The accuracy of the retrieved bathymetry varies with water depth, with the accuracy substantially lower at a depth beyond 12 m. Other influential factors include water turbidity and bottom materials, as well as image properties.																			0309-1333	1477-0296				FEB	2009	33	1					103	116		10.1177/0309133309105657	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0309133309105657													WOS:000267087900006

Paleoclimate records derived from ice cores, lakes, and marine sedimentary archives illustrate rapid changes in the atmosphere-cryosphere-ocean system. Several proxy records and two data-model comparison studies simulate Atlantic meridional overturning circulation during the last deglaciation and millennial-scale temperature oscillations during the last glacial cycle and thereby provide new perspectives on the mechanisms controlling abrupt climate changes. Two hypotheses are presented to explain deep Southern Ocean carbon storage, the rapid increase of the atmospheric carbon dioxide, and retreat of sea ice in the Antarctic Ocean during the last deglaciation. A synthesis of two Holocene climate events at approximately 5.2 ka and 4.2 ka highlights the potential of a rapid response to climate forcing in tropical systems through the hydrological cycle. Both events appear contemporaneous with the collapse of ancient civilizations in low-latitude regions where roughly half of Earth's population lives today.

HYDROBIOLOGIA												Understanding the dynamics of phytoplankton assemblages in various and variable aquatic ecosystems is of paramount importance, given the strategic supporting services offered by these organisms. Such knowledge is implicitly based on the analysis of the realized niche of the different populations, i.e. of the sets of conditions within which populations show a positive growth. The range of phytoplankton morphological traits variability is evolutionarily selected to maximize the ecological performance of species while they are entrained in the spectrum of turbulent flows. In addition, most phytoplankton species exhibit high morphological plasticity that can further optimize their performance under reduced environmental variability. Although this plasticity is well known, it is seldom considered in phytoplankton studies. Morphological analysis could therefore be used as a tool to estimate the environmental variability within which a species can persist and, ultimately, the niche width of phytoplankton populations. This opinion paper tries to answer the questions: to what extent can the morphological variability of phytoplankton offer a synthesis of the environmental variability of aquatic ecosystems?. Do the morphological traits contain sufficient information to describe the width of the realized niche of phytoplankton species? What can we do to fill eventual gaps in our knowledge?

Interaction among morphological, trophic and genetic groups in the rapidly radiating Salvelinus fishes from Lake Kronotskoe	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY												Adaptive radiation in fishes entering novel post-glacial lakes ubiquitously gives rise to a set of typical forms specializing under the pressure of the same ecological gradients. The world's most diverse flock of salmonids from Lake Kronotskoe (Kamchatka, N-E Asia) serves as a good model to study evolutionary divergence modes. Eight forms with different feeding types and habitat preferences are known to originate from Salvelinus malma. To determine the phasing of the flock radiation we analyzed morphometry, muscle isotope content, parasite fauna abundance and microsatellite DNA polymorphism in the sympatric forms inhabiting the lake. We found that seven out of eight morphologically independent forms can be distinguished by a stable feeding niche through comparing the stomach content, isotopic status and parasite fauna abundance. Five eco-morphs were found to be genetically independent, while three other morphs fell into one cluster without any significant restriction of the gene flow among the members. Partitioning of the resources in pelagic-benthic, epilimnetic-deepwater and lacustrine-riverine environments leads to divergence of the most genetically and morphologically distant forms. Smaller genetic and morphometric distances were found for the form pairs diverged along one or two of these gradients. The divergence of the last three eco-morphs in feeding tactics within the coastal zone is not associated with differentiation in microsatellite polymorphism suggesting a more recent and/or subtle specialization within this environment.

Modeling Population Dynamics and Fish Consumption of a Managed Double-Crested Cormorant Colony in Minnesota	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The recovery of the double-crested cormorant Phalacrocorax auritus throughout North America has led to increased human-cormorant competition over fishery resources and has forced managers to evaluate cormorant effects and consider management alternatives at local and broader scales. We present a method for modeling local double-crested cormorant populations under varying levels of culling intensity based on a colony managed at Leech Lake, Minnesota, during 2005-2011. In this case study, the cormorant colony was evaluated under no, moderate, and intensive control rates and compared with the observed population response. Cormorant diets for fledged (adults and subadults) and nestling cormorants were described during 2004-2007 and 2010. Annual fish consumption and 95% confidence intervals were estimated from 1992 to 2011 using a bioenergetics model and Monte Carlo methods. Total feeding effort and fish consumption has been reduced by nearly 90% since cormorant control began in 2005 (consumption reduced from 20.01kg/ha in 2004 to 1.98kg/ha in 2011) and by 46-73% annually, depending on the number of birds arriving each spring and the applied culling intensity. Averaged across all years and periods, fledged cormorants consumed 0.75kg<bold></bold>bird(-1)<bold></bold>d(-1) and nestlings consumed 0.45kg<bold></bold>bird(-1)<bold></bold>d(-1). Respectively, average fledged and nestling diets were comprised of Yellow Perch Perca flavescens (61.0% and 77.4%), Coregonus spp. (12.3% and 9.4%), minnows Notropis spp. (9.9% and 2.2%), Trout-perch Percopsis omiscomaycus (4.1% and 0.4%), and Walleye Sander vitreus (4.6% and 3.6%), though considerable seasonal and temporal variability was observed. The bioenergetics model used to estimate total fish consumption was sensitive to this variability, which was strongly associated with the dynamics of the population of Cisco Coregonus artedi. Some fish population and fishery statistics were described by changes in cormorant predation pressure, but these relationships were compromised by other concurrent management activities.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				DEC 1	2013	33	6					1283	1300		10.1080/02755947.2013.839972	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2013.839972													WOS:000328602500023
J	Hepburn, S				Hepburn, Sharon			Shades of Darkness: Silence, Risk and Fear among Tourists and Nepalis during Nepal's Civil War	JOURNEYS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRAVEL AND TRAVEL WRITING												The conflict between the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) and the Nepalese state, from 1996 until 2006, resulted in thousands of "disappeared" and dead Nepalis, and, especially after 9/11, a sharp decline in tourism in Nepal. Yet the tourists who came had good journeys. Based on ethnographic research, this article explores how these two worlds-of tourism, and the darkness of war, variously experienced-coexisted in the winter of 2002 in the lakeside resort of Pokhara. The article describes how the culture of silence that emerged during the war permeated interactions between Nepalis and visitors, and that there are shades of darkness as well as shades of fear. Situations are not black and white and people's experiences are contingent on contexts and backgrounds that are diverse and complex. Complementing studies of dark tourism, that is tourism about darkness, this is a study of tourism in darkness.																			1465-2609	1752-2358				JUL	2010	11	1					133	155		10.3167/jys.2010.110107	http://dx.doi.org/10.3167/jys.2010.110107													WOS:000213455500007

A hydrochemical and isotopic synoptic sampling program in January 2006 is used to characterize hydrogeology, hydrology, and water quality of the area. Samples were collected from the summit and southern side of Kilimanjaro and the Moshi region (Tanzania). Sample sources included four glaciers, seven groundwater wells, 12 rivers, 10 springs, precipitation, and a lake. Analyses included major ion chemistry, stable isotopes of water (O-18 and D); in addition, seven samples were analyzed for tritium. The samples generally have good water quality with the exception of three samples with elevated fluoride concentrations (> 3 mg/L) and elevated nitrate concentrations (> 2.5 mg/L NO3 as N). There is a strong elevation control on stable isotopes, with an apparent elevation effect of - 0.1 aEuro degrees delta O-18 per 100 m rise in elevation (R (2) = 0.79). The results, including the tritium values, show that the hydrogeologic system is comprised of both local and regional flow systems, and that regional rivers are receiving significant inflow from shallow groundwater, and at very high elevations the hydrologic system is derived from groundwater, precipitation, and glacial melt water.

Upon mission completion, the AUV has to be recovered autonomously through the same ice hole. The autonomous control method for this recovery process is of paramount importance. This paper demonstrates two innovative control strategies: remote homing control and proximal ice hole recovery control, based on an AUV's near-ice dynamics model. For remote homing control, a velocity vector synthesis approach was implemented to design heading guidance, combining velocity, heading, and depth controllers to accomplish the path-tracking control of an AUV. During proximal recovery maneuvers, a PID controller actuates vertical and lateral tunnel thrusters and the aft thruster to achieve precise horizontal alignment relative to the ice holes. Based on the "Wukong 1000" AUV, the control method was validated in the Songhua Lake under the winter ice conditions in Jilin Province, North China, at the beginning of 2024.																					979-8-3315-3748-7; 979-8-3315-3747-0				2025										10.1109/OCEANS58557.2025.11104615	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS58557.2025.11104615													WOS:001565320000226

MONITORING OF Bufo bufo PRE-REPRODUCTION MIGRATION IN AREAS OF THE LOWER DANUBE REGION	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												In March April 2013 there were carried out periodical field investigations in Isaccea Luncavita and Luncavita Cetatuia (the Tulcea county, Romania) areas in order to assess the current status of the Bufo bufo populations in areas located at the northern limit of the distribution of the species on the Dobrogean mainland. The biggest number of adults was recorded at Cetatuia, where several hundreds of specimens use as reproduction sites three small artificial lakes. In the areas located between Isaccea and Luncavita (more precisely, between the Revarsarea and Rachelu villages) there probably are several, small-sized spawning-pools scattered along the reed-dominated marshes bordering the southern shore of the lakes in the Danube valley. During the study there was also assessed the impact of vehicles on the local populations of Bufo bufo in areas where the wintering sites and breeding sites are separated by road with different intensity of car circulation.																			1311-5065						2014	15	2					478	487																WOS:000339362500009

The mean volume of the reservoir was 4% of full storage capacity. Water temperatures ranged from 14-degrees-C to 27-degrees-C. Due to inorganic suspensoids, the euphotic zone averaged 2.6 m. An anaerobic zone developed each summer. The nitrogen, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and silica concentrations did not display a seasonal pattern, but the latter two nutrients declined over the study. The dominant phytoplankton group was the cryptophytes while the zooplankton population was dominated by crustaceans. Chlorophyll a concentrations ranged from 1.1 to 27 mg m-3 and were positively correlated to silica and SRP concentrations and inversely with NH4-N concentrations. Primary production ranged from 22.6 to 375 mgC m-2 h-1; changes in A(max) were positively correlated to silica and SRP concentrations. Total zooplankton dry weight biomass varied from < 0.5 to > 4 mg l-1. Annual zooplankton (secondary) production was 8 to approximately 15 gC m-3 a-1; both primary and secondary production were greatest in the first 12 months of study and remained at low levels for the remainder, similar to the trends for silica and SRP. The data indicate that the reservoir shifted from eutrophic to mesotrophic during the study, typical of events in new reservoirs, and that changes in the plankton populations were largely the result of changing nutrient concentrations.																			0018-8158					JUL 24	1992	237	1					47	60		10.1007/BF00008427	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008427													WOS:A1992JM30900006

The preliminary results show isotopic fractionation of chlorine in salt lake brine during salt precipitation, The variation of the delta(37)Cl value in these salt lakes is mainly associated with brine evaporation and halite precipitation and with the hydrochemistry of the input water. The chlorine isotopic composition may reflect the degree of evaporation of the salt lake brine and may be used to distinguish brines that are in equilibrium with precipitating salts and brines that have dissolved earlier evaporates.

Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and optical metrics of DOM provide clues as to the sources and processes affecting the DOM pool. Herein we provide the first broad-scale characterisation of DOM from Patagonian lakes across a strong west-east precipitation gradient. Fifty-eight lakes from Northern Patagonia (Argentina and Chile) plus six lakes from the Antarctic Peninsula were sampled during summer 2000-01. Six DOM metrics were evaluated: DOC absorbance at 254nm (a(254)) and 350nm (a(350)), DOC-specific absorbance at 254nm (a(254)/DOC) and 350nm (a(350)/DOC) and spectral slope between 275 and 295nm (S275-295). The DOM of Chilean maritime lakes and shallow (<15m) Andean lakes exhibited terrestrial signatures and a pattern of variation consistent with their occurrence across the longitudinal precipitation gradient (i.e. S275-295 increased, whereas a(350)/DOC decreased from west to east). The contribution of allochthonous DOM was smaller in deep (>15m) Andean lakes, which is consistent with their longer water retention time. Steppe lakes, mostly from endorheic basins, made up the most heterogeneous group with regard to DOM characteristics.

Ninety percent of the perennial native vegetation has been cleared and replaced by annual cereal crops and pasture. Consequently, groundwater has risen and much of the region is affected by dryland salinity. River geomorphology and water quality have been severely impacted by land clearing, anthropogenic patterns of land use, and secondary salinization. The objectives of this study were to determine patterns of distribution of aquatic macroinvertebrates in the region, and to identify environmental variables influencing these patterns. Aquatic macroinvertebrates were sampled at 176 river sites during spring 1997 and a range of environmental data were collected at each site Eighty-one families were collected, with the fauna being dominated by insects. At the family level, macroinvertebrate communities were homogeneous and depauperate, and consisted of families that tolerated a broad range of environmental conditions. The fauna was particularly resilient to high salinities, with some families tolerating salinities orders of magnitude greater than previously reported for lotic waters. The most significant environmental factors influencing the distribution of aquatic invertebrates were rainfall, salinity, land use, and instream habitat.

The History of Air Quality in Utah: A Narrative Review	SUSTAINABILITY												Utah has a rich history related to air pollution; however, it is not widely known or documented. This is despite air quality being a top issue of public concern for the state's urban residents and acute episodes that feature some of the world's worst short-term particulate matter exposure. As we discuss in this narrative review, the relationship between air pollution and the state's residents has changed over time, as fuel sources shifted from wood to coal to petroleum and natural gas. Air pollution rose in prominence as a public issue in the 1880s as Utah's urban areas grew. Since then, scientific advances have increased the understanding of air quality impacts on human health, groups of concerned citizens worked to raise public awareness, policy makers enacted legislation to improve air quality, and courts upheld rights to clean air. Utah's air quality future holds challenges and opportunities and can serve as useful case for other urbanizing regions struggling with air quality concerns. Population growth and changing climate will exacerbate current air quality trends, but economically viable clean energy technologies can be deployed to reduce air pollution, bringing substantial public health and economic benefits to the state's residents and other settings with similar public health concerns.					; Mitchell, Logan/A-5481-2011	Zajchowski, Chris A.B./0000-0002-9909-2624; Mitchell, Logan/0000-0002-8749-954X														2071-1050				AUG	2022	14	15							9653	10.3390/su14159653	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14159653													WOS:000840227600001

Two polar hydrometeorological drifters, known as Zeno (R) ice stations, were deployed during CHINARE 2003. A new type of high-resolution Snow and Ice Mass Balance Arrays, known as SIMBA buoys, were deployed during CHINARE 2014. Data from those buoys were applied to investigate the thickness of sea ice and snow in the CHINARE domain. A simple approach was applied to estimate the average snow thickness on the basis of Zeno (R) temperature data. Snow and ice thicknesses were also derived from vertical temperature profile data based on the SIMBA buoys. A one-dimensional snow and ice thermodynamic model (HIGHTSI) was applied to calculate the snow and ice thickness along the buoy drift trajectories. The model forcing was based on forecasts and analyses of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The Zeno (R) buoys drifted in a confined area during 2003-2004. The snow thickness modelled applying HIGHTSI was consistent with results based on Zeno (R) buoy data. The SIMBA buoys drifted from 81.1 degrees N, 157.4 degrees W to 73.5 degrees N, 134.9 degrees W in 15 months during 2014-2015. The total ice thickness increased from an initial August 2014 value of 1.97 m to a maximum value of 2.45 m before the onset of snow melt in May 2015; the last observation was approximately 1 m in late November 2015. The ice thickness based on HIGHTSI agreed with SIMBA measurements, in particular when the seasonal variation of oceanic heat flux was taken into account, but the modelled snow thickness differed from the observed one. Sea ice thickness derived from SIMBA data was reasonably good in cold conditions, but challenges remain in both snow and ice thickness in summer.

All nutrients were accumulated rapidly by shoots in the spring. Some of the N and P came from belowground storage; but K, Ca, and Na were extracted entirely from the soil. Nutrients were immobilized in shoot tissues for different periods of time. K content declined as rapidly as it had accumulated, and there was no evidence of belowground storage. N and P content also declined, though not as rapidly. Approximately 45% of the N and P lost from the shoots was translocated to the rhizomes and stored. Ca and Na were conserved in shoot tissues until the shoots died. In the decomposing litter, K and Na content declined, P and Ca content remained relatively constant, but N content increased. Over the full year of production and decomposition, this T. glauca stand accumulated Ca and N, maintained P levels, and lost K and Na.																			0304-3770	1879-1522					1983	16	1					75	89		10.1016/0304-3770(83)90053-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(83)90053-0													WOS:A1983QV53400007

In the western United States it is a species of special concern where population densities in some rivers and streams are very large (similar to 300,000 per m(2)) and considerable ecological effects of its presence have been reported. Much less about the effects of this species is known in the Great Lakes, where the snail was found in Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River in 1991. Here we report the occurrence of the snail in Lake Erie. Two P. antipodarum were collected in 18 in deep water (sampling range 5-18 m) in Lake Erie off shore of Presque Isle State Park near Erie, Pennsylvania in the summer of 2005 and others were collected off of Sturgeon Point in Lake Erie (sampling range 5-20 m) south of Buffalo, NY and in the central basin of Lake Erie (18 m) in 2006. This finding demonstrates that this species continues to expand its range in the Great Lakes. The range expansion increases the likelihood that it may become established in rivers and streams emptying into the Great Lakes where higher densities and greater ecological damage may result.

J	Redihan, EE				Redihan, Erin E.			The Gerald R. Ford Administration and the Olympic Movement: Political Games	SPORT HISTORY REVIEW												This article looks at the ways in which the Gerald Ford administration involved itself in the United States Olympic program. Though short in tenure, Ford's administration dealt with four Olympic-related issues and acted in the best interest of the US Olympic Movement in each case: the creation of the President's Commission on Olympic Sports, funding for the 1980 Lake Placid Winter Games, the revocation of Radio Free Europe's press credentials in Innsbruck, and the status of the Republic of China's team in Montreal. It argues that Ford understood the distinction between presidential support for the Games and too much presidential interference in the Olympic Movement and that his administration always acted appropriately. Though often overshadowed by his successor Jimmy Carter's outright interference in American sporting diplomacy, Ford's legacy regarding American amateur sport and particularly the Olympic Games should be positive.																			1087-1659	1543-2947				MAY	2019	50	1					54	74		10.1123/shr.2017-0044	http://dx.doi.org/10.1123/shr.2017-0044													WOS:000468355000004
J	GOFF, F; GARDNER, JN				GOFF, F; GARDNER, JN			EVOLUTION OF A MINERALIZED GEOTHERMAL SYSTEM, VALLES CALDERA, NEW-MEXICO	ECONOMIC GEOLOGY AND THE BULLETIN OF THE SOCIETY OF ECONOMIC GEOLOGISTS												The 20-km-diam Valles caldera formed at 1.13 Ma and had continuous postcaldera rhyolitic eruptions until 0.13 Ma. Hot springs and fumaroles are surface manifestations of a hydrothermal reservoir (210 degrees-300 degrees C; 2-10 X 10(3) mg/kg Cl) that is most extensive in fractured, caldera fill tuffs and associated sedimentary rocks, located in specific structural zones. Fluids are composed of deeply circulating water of (primarily) meteoric origin that have a mean residence time in the reservoir of 3 to 10 k.y. The only component of clearly magmatic origin is anomalous He-3 although it is possible that some magmatic water, carbon, and sulfur is contributed to present hydrothermal fluids. Host rocks show intense isotopic exchange with hydrothermal fluids. Alteration assemblages are controlled by temperature, permeability, fluid composition, host-rock type, and depth. A generalized distribution from top to bottom of the system consists of argillic, phyllic, propylitic, and calc-silicate assemblages. Typical alteration minerals in phyllic and propylitic zones are quartz, calcite, illite, chlorite, epidote, and pyrite, whereas common vein minerals consist of the above minerals plus fluorite, adularia, and wairakite. Argentiferous pyrite, pyrargyrite, molybdenite, sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite, stibnite, barite, and tetradymite (?) have been found at various depths in the Valles system. Fluid inclusion studies show that these mineral assemblages formed from liquid water (0-5.5 wt % NaCl equiv) at temperatures ranging from 175 degrees to 310 degrees C, depending on location in the system. Fluid inclusion studies also show that the top of the liquid-dominated zone has descended, leaving behind a low-pressure vapor cap. Dating of spring deposits, core samples of vein minerals, and altered host rocks by K-Ar, U-Th, U-U, and paleomagnetic methods indicates that the hydrothermal system was created at about 1.0 Ma and has been continuously active to the present. However, these dates in combination with geologic and fluid inclusion evidence suggest that the vapor zone formed at about 0.5 Ma, after a breach of the southwest caldera wall drained widespread intracaldera lakes and lowered the hydraulic head on the hydrothermal reservoir. Although petrologic and geophysical evidence indicates that residual pockets of melt still reside in the pluton beneath the caldera, the size of the hydrothermal system has shrunk since initial formation. Thus, the Valles caldera contains a mature hydrothermal system that remains hot, that contains a classic geothermal configuration, and that displays many analogies to epithermal mineral deposits exposed in older volcanic environments.																			0361-0128					DEC	1994	89	8					1803	1832																WOS:A1994QK97300009

Yet, they have important ecological functions and societies are reliant on their surface waters for their lives and livelihoods. It is essential to monitor and understand the dynamics of these lakes to assess past, present, and future water resource changes. In this paper, we present an innovative approach to unravel the sediment and water balance of Lac Wegnia, a small ungauged lake in Mali near the capital of Bamako. The approach uses optical remote sensing data to identify the shoreline positions over a period of 22 years (2000-2021) and then attributes water surface heights (WSHs) to each observation using the lake bathymetry. We then present a novel methodology to identify and quantitatively analyze deposition and erosion patterns at lakeshores and in lake beds. The method therefore represents a significant advancement over previous attempts to remotely monitor lakes in the West African drylands, since it considers not only changes in water depth to explain recent declining trends in lake areas, but also changes in the storage capacity. At Lac Wegnia, we recognize silting at the tributaries to the lake, but overall, erosion processes are dominant and threaten the persistence of the lake because of progressive erosion through the natural levee at the lake outlet. This factor contributes 66%+/- 18% to the decreasing WSH trend, while 34%+/- 18 % of the dry-season lake level changes are explained by increasing evaporation from the lake and by possibly falling groundwater tables. Due to the decreasing reservoir capacity of the lake, WSHs are declining even in the wet season in spite of positive rainfall patterns.

However, the specific effects of DO stratification on N speciation and transformation behaviors in different water layers are still poorly understood. Here, we reported that DO stratification remarkably influenced N species and transformation pathways in different water columns by high frequency sampling during summers in Longjing Lake, China. Results showed that DO stratification in the lake created three water layers: epilimnion (1-3m), oxycline (4-11m), and hypolimnion (12-20m). In the epilimnion, N speciation was mainly controlled by phytoplankton assimilation and organic N dominated in this layer. Oxycline was the major place for N transformations and had the most notable N removal capacity (714kgN from June to August). In the hypolimnion, NH4+ was the major N species, and sediment release contributed nearly 85% hypolimnetic NH4+. Furthermore, approximately 8kg of dissolved N2O was also accumulated in the hypolimnion, contributing similar to 70% of N2O in the whole lake. Overall, our results indicated that DO stratification caused the shifts in N speciation and transformation behaviors among different water columns, which may have a great implication for lake managements for providing separated protection strategies from different water depths.					; CHEN, YI/AAQ-2848-2021	Su, Xiaoxuan/0000-0001-6965-7084; Chen, Yi/0000-0002-8298-0350; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2019	26	3					2898	2907		10.1007/s11356-018-3716-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-3716-1								30499088					WOS:000456198400073

DSWEmod - The Production of High-Frequency Surface Water Map Composites from Daily MODIS Images	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Optical satellite imagery is commonly used for monitoring surface water dynamics, but clouds and cloud shadows present challenges in assembling complete water time series. To test whether the daily revisit rate of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery can reduce cloud obstruction and improve high-frequency surface water mapping, we compared map results derived from Landsat (30-m) and MODIS (250-m) data across the state of California for 2003-2019. We adapted the Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWE) model in Google Earth Engine to generate surface water map composites from MODIS imagery every 5, 10, 15, and 30 days, and compared products to monthly Landsat-based DSWE maps. Results for DSWEmod (DSWE MODIS) in California suggest that more than 5% data loss (cloud obstruction, etc.) was present in only 2% of the 15-day time series, as compared to 32% of the monthly Landsat DSWE time series. The five-day DSWEmod composites averaged 8.4% obscuration in the winter months. Area estimates derived from cloud-filtered MODIS and Landsat monthly products have the highest linear correlations compared to streamgage discharge records, suggesting that monthly scale analyses best explain the relationship between surface water area and general streamflow dynamics. Shorter-interval DSWEmod products have lower correlations but utility for understanding the timing of surface water peaks and past flood events.

Morphological and organogenic development, growth rates, and biometric relationships were studied during the sequential developmental stages. The most obvious feature of day 0 juveniles was a mobile foot. Adult morphology was apparent after 60days, and the inner organs were well formed. Annuli were deposited on the shell's surface in winter. Males and females became sexually mature at approximately 750days. Early increases in shell size were rapid (0-180days), whereas between 180 and 750days, growth rate became slower and stable. The relationship between length (L, mm) and age (t, days) from 0 to 60days was logistic: L=21.98/[1+e(-0.067(t-65.131))] (R-2=0.955), while the relationship fitted in von Bertalanffy growth equation from 60 to 750days: L=58.417[1-e(-0.015(t-46.782))] (R-2=0.906). The relationship between length and width was negative allometric, but the relationships between length and height and between width and height were positive allometric. The results can provide a useful basis for further study on A. woodiana and its population restoration through artificial cultivation.

In the summer of 2012, dead tadpoles and adults of the European common frog Rana temporaria were reported in alpine lakes in the southwestern Alps (Mercantour National Park, France). A preliminary investigation using molecular diagnostic techniques identified a Ranavirus as the potential pathogenic agent. Three mortality events were recorded in the park, and samples were collected. The amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis was not detected in any of the dead adult and juvenile frogs sampled (n = 16) whereas all specimens were positive for a Ranavirus. The genome sequence of this Ranavirus was identical to previously published sequences of the common midwife toad virus (CMTV), a Ranavirus that has been associated with amphibian mortalities throughout Europe. We cultured virus from the organs of the dead common frogs and infecting adult male common frogs collected in another alpine region where no frog mortality had been observed. The experimentally infected frogs suffered 100% mortality (n = 10). The alpine die-off is the first CMTV outbreak associated with mass mortality in wild amphibians in France. We describe the lesions observed and summarize amphibian populations affected by Ranaviruses in Europe. In addition, we discuss the ecologic specificities of mountain amphibians that may contribute to increasing their risk of exposure to and transmission of Ranaviruses.

"It's All French Over There": My Quest for Franco-Ontarians around Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS												As an Ohio-based (U.S.) French instructor and francophile, I explored Ontario (Canada) in search of Franco-Ontarian communities. Eager to understand their position within larger anglophone-dominant spheres -- positions that are unique from neighboring Francophone communities of Quebec-- I traveled to such communities. An international border divides Lake Erie, thus making Ontario a polity bordering Ohio. Inspired by a provincial-government map documenting communities of Francophone communities, I took advantage of a winter break to wander via automobile. Finding little public evidence of French, I was often told to venture "over there". This adventure led me to important discoveries about the perceptions of minority linguistic communities amongst anglophone Ontarians, which become clearer through Foucault's concept of heterotopia and Bronfenbrenner's ecological model. This quest for Franco-Ontarians made me revisit my own cultural assumptions. Findings encourage more nuanced understandings of the nature of minority linguistic communities and the ways in which they are represented.																			2162-3104	2166-3750					2023	13	4					280	289																WOS:001156410800020

These events can completely block the trash rack and unexpectedly shut down the intake facility. The blockages of intake trash racks occur in cold weather and under water, making them difficult to observe and measure. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models provide a valuable method of understanding the operating conditions and phenomena that occur inside the water intake with different blockage percentages. Hot flow is simulated to be injected into the water intake to against the frazil ice formation. Simulation results include the flow velocity, mass flow rate and the water temperature distribution. The injected flow includes hot water and steam bubbles. It is concluded that hot water injection can only heat the water flow below the trash rack, but steam bubble injection rises throughout the geometry and produces turbulences along the bubble paths.

Evaluating the impacts of climate change and crop land use change on streamflow, nitrates and phosphorus: A modeling study in Bavaria	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: Bavaria, Germany. Study focus: The Altmuhl River is prone to nutrient inputs from agricultural activities. Quantifying nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations due to potential futurechanges in the watershed is necessary for managing water quality and adhering to water policy directives. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to provide stakeholders with support in determining the impacts of climate change (CC) in combination with crop land use change (LUC) scenarios on streamflow, NO3--N and TP to the 2050 time horizon. The CC simulations stemmed from RCMs and the LUC scenarios were developed with stakeholders. New hydrological insights for the region: When CC was combined with LUC, mean annual NO3--N loads increased 3-fold, and TP loads 8-fold, compared to the CC simulations alone. Nutrient loads were higher in several months due to the future increased annual precipitation plus the additional fertilizer input in the land use scenarios. The maize areas above the Altmuhl Lake contributed greatly to TP loads, while winter wheat areas mainly contributed to NO3--N loads. When CC was combined with LUC, the in-stream nutrient concentrations exceeded ministerial guidelines of 11 mg TP/L and 0.05 mg NO3--N/L every month at the outlet. CC simulations combined with LUC scenarios demonstrated non-linear dynamics whereby the direction and the magnitude of impacts were not predictable from the individual changes alone.

Comparison with the original description revealed that the present trichodinid morphometry coincides with the minimal ranges of the original population and might be attributed to the new host and habitat. Scanning electron observations showed firm junctions of denticles through the fairly developed central parts. A new described character of this genus was clearly visible in the ray structure.

OCCURRENCE CHARACTERISTICS OF STEPHANODISCUS AND SYNEDRA IN RELATION TO WATER TEMPERATURE AND CONCENTRATIONS OF NUTRIENTs DURING SPRING DIATOM BLOOM IN LAKE PALDANG, KOREA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Physicochemistry was measured weekly from 2014-2017 at sites PD1, PD2, and PD3 in Lake Paldang, Korea. The effects of temperature and nutrients on the growth of the freshwater diatoms Stephanodiscus and Synedra were determined. PD2 had higher water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and conductivity than PD3. Total phosphorus and nitrogen at PD2 were the highest (0.038 mg/L and 2.181 mg/L, respectively). However, PD3 had more silicon (1.396 mg/L) than PD2 (1.027 mg/L). Stephanodiscus and Synedra bloomed mainly between March and May. At all three sites, Stephanodiscus was detected at 1.2-22.7 degrees C and its density was the highest at 6.7 degrees C. Synedra was detected at 1.2-32.8 degrees C and its density was the highest at 13-15 degrees C. Stephanodiscus and Synedra proliferated when TP was >= 0.020 mg/L and <= 0.020 mg/L, respectively, and Si was <= 0.4 mg/L and >= 0.4 mg/L, respectively. Therefore, temperature, phosphorus and silicon significantly influenced diatom growth.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2020	18	4					5135	5147		10.15666/aeer/1804_51355147	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1804_51355147													WOS:000572421000014

Fe coupled inactivation of P in sediments is an important factor which affects internal P release in freshwater lakes. In this study, two in-situ high-resolution diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) techniques, Zr-Oxide DGT and ZrO-Chelex DGT, were used to investigate the release characteristics of P from sediments in a large freshwater lake (Dongting Lake, China; area of 2691 km(2)) experiencing a regional summer algal bloom. Two-dimensional distributions of labile P in sediments were imaged with the ZrOxide DGT without destruction of the original structure of the sediment layer at four sites of the lake. The concentration of DGT-labile P in the sediments, ranging from 0.007 to 0.206 mg L-1, was highly heterogeneous across the profiles. The values of apparent diffusion flux (F-d) and release flux (F-r) of P varied between-0.027-0.197 mg m(-2) d(-1), and 0.037-0.332 mg m(-2) d(-1), respectively. Labile P showed a high and positive correlation (p < 0.01) with labile Fe(II) in the profiles, providing high-resolution evidence for the key role of Fe-redox cycling in labile P variation in sediments.

The value of the high Aswan Dam to the Egyptian economy	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS					7th International Conference of the European-Society-for-Ecological-Economics - Integrating Natural and Social Sciences for Sustainability	JUN 05-08, 2007	Leipzig, GERMANY					The High Aswan Dam converted a variable and uncertain flow of Nile river water into a predictable and controllable water supply stored in Lake Nasser. We use a computable general equilibrium model of the Egyptian economy to estimate the economic impact of the High Aswan Dam. We compare the actual 1997 economy to the 1997 economy as it would have been if historical pre-dam Nile flows (drawn from a 72 year portrait) had applied (i.e., the Dam had not been built). The steady water supply sustained by the High Aswan Dam increased transport productivity, and year round availability of predictable and adequate water sustained a shift towards more valuable summer crops. These static effects are worth EGP 4.9 billion. Investments in transport and agriculture increased as a consequence; these investments, assuming that Egypt is a small open economy, added another EGP 1.1 billion to the value of the Dam. The risk premium on the reduced variability is estimated to be EGP 1.1 billion for a modest risk aversion, and perhaps EGP 4.4 billion for a high risk aversion. The total gain of EGP 7.1 billion to 10.3 EGP billion equals 2.7% to 4.0% of annual GDP in 1997. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

To provide basic information for the conservation of Greater White-fronted Geese in Japan, this study investigated factors associated with the distribution of the species by using data from the nationwide waterfowl survey. The geese were observed in 88 grid cells (about 10 km x 10 km) in 2008-2012. The maximum entropy approach was adopted to model the distribution using presence-only data. Explanatory variables were the proportion of rice field area, urban area, and lake area; distance to lakes; and maximum snow depth. Spatial filters were also included in the model to account for spatial autocorrelation. Habitat suitability for the geese was high in areas with a high proportion of rice fields, having a certain proportion of urban area and lake area and less snow. Consequently, the suitable habitats tended to be distributed on the plains along the Sea of Japan and Pacific coasts. This study represents the first step towards habitat management and restoration of Greater White-fronted Geese in Japan.					; Moriguchi, Sachiko/M-1117-2019; Amano, Tatsuya/E-7367-2010	Moriguchi, Sachiko/0000-0002-2389-6722; Amano, Tatsuya/0000-0001-6576-3410													1347-0558					DEC	2013	12	2					117	125		10.2326/osj.12.117	http://dx.doi.org/10.2326/osj.12.117													WOS:000330926400005

Mean annual temperatures at the top of permafrost were several degrees warmer in thaw slumps (-0.1 degrees C to -2.2 degrees C) than beneath adjacent undisturbed tundra (-6.1 degrees C to -6.7 degrees C). Simulations using a two-dimensional thermal model showed that the thermal disturbance caused by thaw slumping adjacent to tundra lakes can lead to rapid near-surface lateral talik expansion. Talik growth into ice-rich materials is likely to cause lake-bottom subsidence and rejuvenation of shoreline slumping. The observed association of thaw slumps with tundra lakes, the absence of active slumps on the shores of drained lakes where permafrost is aggradational and depressions in the lake bottom adjacent to thaw slumps provide empirical evidence that thermal disturbance, talik enlargement and thawing of subadjacent ice-rich permafrost can drive the polycyclic behaviour (initiation and growth of slump within an area previously affected by slumping) of lakeside thaw slumps.

Micro-benthic crustacean communities in tundra lakes of North-East European Russia	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												We studied micro-benthic copepods and cladocerans in the bottom substrates of 12 lakes in the Bol'shezemel'skaya tundra in North-East European Russia during the summer. About 30 species of Cladocera and 28 species and subspecies of Copepoda were found. The majority of the micro-crustaceans are palaearctic or northern palaearctic. But the harpacticoid fauna of the western part of the studied region had specific European features, and three species of the harpacticoid fauna in the eastern part of the region were Siberian. It is therefore a boundary territory for two zoogeographical regions, the arctic and subarctic zones. Acidophilic (Arcticocamptus arcticus (Lilljeborg 1902)) and halophilic (Microsetella norvegica (Boeck 1864)) harpacticoid species were found in the lakes of the eastern part of Bol'shezemel'skaya tundra. On basis of their way of locomotion we distinguished five ecological groups and on basis of their feeding habits four ecological groups of micro-crustaceans. Groups with a similar way of locomotion were likely distributed over the studied water bodies. Habitat (inshore versus offshore), substrate particle size and substrate hardness were of paramount importance for the species distribution.

J	FERRIS, JM; TYLER, PA				FERRIS, JM; TYLER, PA			THE EFFECTS OF INFLOW AND OUTFLOW ON THE SEASONAL BEHAVIOR OF A STRATIFIED RESERVOIR IN TEMPERATE AUSTRALIA - A 20 YEAR ANALYSIS	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Twenty years of thermal and oxygen data for the deepest part of a temperate impoundment are described in relation to the effects of seasonally and interannually unpredictable inflows. Lake Burragorang has a warm monomictic thermal cycle with a short (1 - 2 month) holomictic period which is modified in about 50 % of years by cold, stabilizing inflows that prevent the development of a physically and chemically homogeneous water column. Although similar behaviour has been considered to be a form of temporary meromixis, we argue that this is inappropriate when the advective stabilization involves upward displacement of the existing hypolimnion and the isolation of the most recently influent water which is initially well oxygenated. During thermal stratification, the hypolimnetic oxygen concentration declines at an average rate of approximately 0.58 mgl-1(5.1 % saturation) month-1 to a minimum of from 0 to 3.8 mg l-1 (0 - 35 % saturation). Adjusted for temperature, this rate falls below the median rate reported for 21 European and North American lakes. In the period 1961 to 1980, hypolimnetic anoxia was recorded only once, following floods which brought very turbid water into the lake. The hypolimnetic oxygen minimum is frequently observed to form at some distance above the lake bottom and this is tentatively ascribed to the effects of the withdrawal current associated with the fixed-level hydroelectric power offtake. The descriptive account given here clearly indicates the contribution of inflows and outflows to the year to year variation of thermal and oxygen stratification in Lake Burragorang and underlines the importance of long term data collection as a means of understanding the extent of that variation.																			0003-9136					DEC	1992	126	2					129	162																WOS:A1992KD31200001

J	Bremle, G; Larsson, P				Bremle, G; Larsson, P			PCB in Eman river ecosystem	AMBIO												Atmospheric deposition is one source of persistent pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) in aquatic environments. Other point sources can also contribute to the PCB loadings in the water. In Eman river, in southeast Sweden, contaminated sediment was a source of PCB, the largest deposits of it being found in a small lake Lake Jarnsjon) connected with the river the sediment contained about 400 kg of PCB. The concentrations of PCB in the water and in the fish were more elevated downstream from the lake than at upstream sites. Jarnsjon was cleaned-up by dredging in 1993 and 1994. The dredged sediment, estimated to contain over 95% of the PCB in the lake, was deposited in a landfill. Monitoring carried on for 2-years following completion of the remediation showed thereto be a decrease in the PCB concentration in the water of the lake. The PCB was found to vary seasonally with water discharge and with temperature. The PCB concentration was highest at low water discharge and high temperature. Both the levels of PCB and the variations in these levels approached those found at an upstream location. Upstream precipitation was found to be the main source of PCB during high water discharge, desorption from the sediment prevailing under conditions of law water discharge. In the summer of 1996, nearly 2 years after remediation had been completed, an investigation of the PCB concentrations in the fish of the river system was conducted. This investigation was a repetition of one made in 1991, prior to remediation. It showed that after remediation the concentration of PCB in l-yr old fish in Lake Jarnsjon had been halved.																			0044-7447	1654-7209				AUG	1998	27	5					384	392																WOS:000077814700003
J	CORNETT, RJ				CORNETT, RJ			PREDICTING CHANGES IN HYPOLIMNETIC OXYGEN CONCENTRATIONS WITH PHOSPHORUS RETENTION, TEMPERATURE, AND MORPHOMETRY	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A statistical analysis of the rate of change in oxygen concentrations (VOD, mg O2 m-3 d-1) in 1-m-thick strata in the hypolimnia of 29 lakes suggests that these rates can be predicted from a knowledge of the annual retention of phosphorus by the lake sediments, the mean summer temperature of the stratum, and the morphometry of the stratum. VOD values increased as temperature and phosphorus retention increased. Rates were inversely proportional to the ratio of the volume of the stratum divided by the area of sediments that are contiguous to the stratum. The statistical model was tested by measuring VOD values in an independent group of 12 lakes. Predictions agreed well with the measured values. An analysis of the combined data explained 91% of the variance in VOD values. The regression correctly predicted the vertical variation in VOD values in lakes that exhibited negative heterograde, orthograde, and clinograde oxygen profiles. After further testing, this model should provide a method of predicting changes in oxygen concentrations in lakes that are subject to perturbations such as changes in temperature or nutrient loading.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	1989	34	7					1359	1366		10.4319/lo.1989.34.7.1359	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1989.34.7.1359													WOS:A1989CH69800023

Acoustic data were collected during daytime by using a Simrad EY60 echosounder with 70- and 120-kHz split beam transducers. Afterward, the undesirable data were eliminated, data transformation was carried out, the semivariogram models were statistically compared and filtered and subsequently OK was performed. The goodness of fit of OK was also assessed with the determination coefficient (R2), mean error (ME), and root mean square error (RMSE). The exponential model was the most suitable semivariogram model for the data, and the goodness of fit of OK was good (R2 = 0.8986, Pearson's r = 0.9481). The distribution pattern of fishery resources is probably less distributed from north to south and from east to west, which is consistent with the findings in the Summer between 1998 and 1999.

J	Tokano, T				Tokano, Tetsuya			Simulation of tides in hydrocarbon lakes on Saturn's moon Titan	OCEAN DYNAMICS												Numerous hydrocarbon lakes have recently been detected on Saturn's largest moon Titan, representing the only known large bodies of liquids on a planetary surface outside the Earth. In the context of comparative oceanography, tides and tidal currents in two representative lakes on Titan (Kraken Mare and Ontario Lacus) are simulated by a three-dimensional baroclinic ocean circulation model. Since the tide-generating force on Titan is an order of magnitude larger than on Earth and the gravitational acceleration is small, tides and currents are substantially larger than in Earth's lakes and are more comparable with those in Earth's oceans. The predicted maximum tidal range in Kraken Mare is 4 m. The tidal wave propagates around the basin of Kraken Mare, while a nearly standing tidal wave is excited in Ontario Lacus. Titan's rotation is too slow to affect the tidal flow in any Titan's lake. The tidal current velocity in Kraken Mare amounts to a few centimeters per second except in the vicinity of a narrow strait, where it is enhanced by an order of magnitude. In summer, when the lake is stratified, internal tides can develop. Seiches cannot be caused by tide. In the largest lakes, atmospheric tide may cause additional lake surface displacements.																			1616-7341	1616-7228				AUG	2010	60	4					803	817		10.1007/s10236-010-0285-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10236-010-0285-3													WOS:000280728400003

The possible formation of a discontinuity layer was studied. Beside the measurements of physical and chemical water parameters the quantitative estimation of the microorganisms taking part in the transformation of inorganic and organic materials was performed. Although the greatest depth of the former river course is just 5 m, a summer stratification was typical as was proved by in-situ measurements and laboratory analyses: an anaerobic water body was formed under 2-2.5 m depth. The discontinuity layer was clearly proved by an intensive peak in the chlorophyll level, the sulphate-sulphide chemocline, an abrupt dropping of the water-temperature, etc. Interesting was also the dominance of phototrophs again in the deeper anoxic water masses, near the bottom.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV 15	2003	506	1-3					37	44																WOS:000188455600006

Geoffrey			Variability in periphyton community and biomass over 37 years in Lake Tahoe (CA-NV)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Nuisance periphyton blooms are occurring in oligotrophic lakes worldwide, but few lakes have documented changes in biomass through periphyton monitoring. For decades periphyton has caused concern about oligotrophic Lake Tahoe's nearshore water quality. To determine whether eulittoral periphyton increased in Lake Tahoe, measures of biomass and dominant communities at 0.5 m below lake level have been monitored regularly at nine shoreline sites starting in 1982, with up to 54 additional sites monitored annually at peak biomass. Lake-wide, this metric of periphyton biomass has not increased since monitoring began. Biomass decreased at many sites and increased at one. Periphyton biomass peaked in March and was low in the summer lake-wide. The northern and western shores had higher biomass than the eastern and southern shores. Biomass varied with lake level. High biomass occurred at sites regardless of urban development levels. As increasing periphyton at Lake Tahoe was first cited in scientific literature in the 1960s, it is possible that periphyton increased prior to our monitoring program. A dearth of published long-term monitoring data from oligotrophic lakes with reported periphyton blooms makes it difficult to determine the extent of this issue worldwide. Long-term nearshore monitoring is crucial for tracking and understanding periphyton blooms.

Towards a global interpretation of dual nitrate isotopes in surface waters	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY X												Modern anthropogenic activities have significantly increased nitrate (NO3-) concentrations in surface waters. Stable isotopes (delta N-15 and delta O-18) in NO3- offer a tool to deconvolute some of the human-made changes in the nitrogen cycle. They are often graphically illustrated on a template designed to identify different sources of NO3- and denitrification. In the two decades since this template was developed, delta N-1(5)- and delta O-1(8)-NO3- have been measured in a variety of ecosystems and through the nitrogen cycle. However, its interpretation is often fuzzy or complex. This default is no longer helpful because it does not describe surface water ecosystems well and biases researchers towards denitrification as the NO3- removal pathway, even in well oxygenated systems where denitrification is likely to have little to no influence on the nitrogen cycle. We propose a different scheme to encourage a better understanding of the nitrogen cycle and interpretation of NO3- isotopes. We use a mechanistic understanding of NO3- formation to place bounds on the oxygen isotope axis and provide a means to adjust for different environmental water isotope values, so data from multiple sites and times of year can be appropriately compared. We demonstrate that any interpretation of our example datasets (Canada, Kenya, United Kingdom) show clear evidence of denitrification or a mixture of NO3- sources simply because many data points fall outside of arbitrary boxes which cannot be supported once the range of potential delta O-1(8)-NO(3)(- )values has been considered.					; Gooddy, Daren/A-7442-2013	Venkiteswaran, Jason J./0000-0002-6574-7071; Gooddy, Daren/0000-0002-6015-1332														2589-9155				JUL	2019	4								100037	10.1016/j.hydroa.2019.100037	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hydroa.2019.100037													WOS:000658513800005
J	DeJonge, VN				DeJonge, VN			High remaining productivity in the Dutch western Wadden Sea despite decreasing nutrient inputs from riverine sources	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Annual primary production data for the western Dutch Wadden Sea between the mid 1960s and 1986 have more than tripled, when compared with 1950, the increase appears more than tenfold. There are indications that the increase in primary production of the phytoplankton over that period has been fuelled by the phosphate loading from Lake IJssel, a Rhine tributary, This also suggests that, on an annual basis, the primary production in the western Dutch Wadden Sea over the period 1950 to 1986 was mainly limited by phosphate. Despite a significant decrease in the phosphorus loads since the early 1980s, the primary production in recent years remained higher than expected based on the emission reduction. This unexpectedly high primary production of phytoplankton might have been caused by a series of other changes in inputs, including the influence of the influx from the English Channel. Clear conclusions, however, are at present not possible due to the complex influence of nutrients, irradiance, mixing and water circulation on the phytoplankton dynamics.

Sedimentary analysis and magnetic properties of Lake Anonima, Vega Island	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												During the summer Lake Anonima experiences important changes in salinity and lake level fluctuations. Physicochemical data and field observations indicate that evaporative processes are dominant and that the water inflow is mainly provided by snow meltwater and streams. A multiproxy analysis of data from lake bottom sediments suggests that the main surface stream located south-west of the lake controls the clastic input and the spatial variation of sediment composition. Through an integrated analysis (magnetic, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies) magnetite and greigite minerals were identified in these lake sediments. Such ferrimagnetic minerals have ultra-fine grain sizes (< 0.1 mu m). Magnetic parameters and non-magnetic variables analysed by multivariate statistics reveal significant differences between silt facies (e.g. mass-specific susceptibility. chi = 109.6 x 10(-8)m(3)kg(-1), remanent coercivity H-cr = 49.2mT and total organic carbon (TOC) = 1.11%) and sand facies (e.g.. = 82.1 x 10(-8)m(3)kg(-1), Hcr = 44.7mT and TOC = 0.70%), and four recent depositional sub-environments were identified and characterized in Lake Anonima. This multiparameter analysis contributes to the understanding of present-day lacustrine dynamic and sedimentary processes. Lake Anonima may provide a useful analogue for the interpretation of other lacustrine basins in the Antarctic region.					; Iraizoz Barrios, Ana/GWC-8382-2022; Chaparro, Marcos/O-9042-2019; Lecomte, Karina/KHD-3796-2024	Chaparro, Marcos/0000-0003-2832-2151; Cordoba, Francisco E./0000-0001-8341-4951; LECOMTE, KARINA LETICIA/0000-0001-6901-0918; Uran, Gimena Mariel/0000-0001-9571-1291; Bohnel, Harald/0000-0002-3833-225X; Gargiulo, Jose Daniel/0000-0002-8285-3634; Chaparro, Mauro A.E./0009-0005-5983-8398													0954-1020	1365-2079				OCT	2017	29	5					429	444		10.1017/S0954102017000116	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954102017000116													WOS:000412678800006

This article proposes a hyperspectral image classification method using the PSO-SVM model to achieve information extraction and temporal feature analysis of the Poyang Lake wetland. The research results indicate that: (1) PSO-SVM successfully completed the parameter optimization process and the classification performance of the SVM model. (2) Wetlands only saw minor changes throughout the course of the three-year period from 2017 to 2019, mostly as a result of cloud cover during satellite images. Additional changes in characteristic kinds occur with winter. Every year, the courses of dry river basins change. It is anticipated that the suggested PSO-SVM model will be able to offer enough reference viewpoints for monitoring and analyzing changes in wetland information.																					979-8-3503-9147-3; 979-8-3503-9146-6				2024							42	46		10.1109/OGC62429.2024.10738738	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/OGC62429.2024.10738738													WOS:001411832000009

The MaxEnt model is widely used in species habitat suitability modeling. In order to investigate the habitat status of the black-necked crane in the Zoige grassland wetland ecological function area, this study evaluated the habitat suitability of the black-necked crane using the MaxEnt model with 152 occurrence records and 13 environmental variables. Based on the Akaike information criterion corrected for the small sample size, the best optimal parameter combination (feature class LQPHT, regularization multiplier 3.0) was selected. The results show that the Maxent model had good accuracy with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.895. Distance to roads, average summer precipitation, distance to lakes, and altitude are the dominant environmental variables affecting the potential distribution of black-necked cranes, with the contribution rates of 31.6%, 29.8%, 14.3%, and 8.2%, respectively. The suitable habitat area of black-necked cranes is mainly distributed in and around the Zoige Wetland National Nature Reserve, accounting for 46.49% of the Zoige Grassland Wetland National Key Ecological Function Zone. The potential distribution area has a tendency to spread to Hongyuan County in the south of the functional zone, and the unsuitable habitat is mainly distributed in the high-altitude area in the southwest of the functional zone. This study recommends focusing on the distribution area of black-necked cranes around Zoige Wetland National Nature Reserve and Hongyuan County to improve conservation strategies and strengthen protection efforts.

THE MIGRATORY FATTENING OF THE BARN SWALLOW HIRUNDO RUSTICA IN HUNGARY	ACTA ZOOLOGICA ACADEMIAE SCIENTIARUM HUNGARICAE												Studies conducted within the framework of the EURING Swallow Project in the Mediterranean area pointed out that the fattening of Barn Swallows is dependent on the distance they need to cover to pass over ecological barriers, such as sea and desert via their migration route. Our study was conducted at inland sites and we analysed the data in comparison to results previously obtained in the western Mediterraneum. Barn Swallows were captured at two roosting sites in Hungary: Ocsa peat bog and Izsak, at Lake Kolon between 2000-2002 with tape-luring set up each day one and a half hours before sunset. During the study period 7000 adult and 36000 juvenile Barn Swallows were caught. Wing length, 3rd primary length, tail length, body mass and fat score were measured for all adults and for the first 100 juveniles birds each night. Based on the dynamics of fat accumulation the study period was separated to a post-breeding, a transitional and a pre-migratory phase. The observed pattern between years and sites were similar, and there were recaptures during the same autumn between the two roosting sites (60 km from each other) to north and to south direction as well. Our results can not exclude one of the two alternative hypotheses on Barn Swallow migration strategy that is: (1) Barn Swallows build up their fat reserves in Hungary and afterwards they maintain it while slowly reaching the ecological barriers, and (2) Barn Swallows capable of a non-stop migration from Hungary to the southern edge of the Sahara. Efforts to find important refuelling sites in the eastern Mediterranean are needed to support any of the hypotheses.

Mercury concentrations in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) from five South Carolina reservoirs	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Mercury concentrations in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) bass were compared among five reservoirs in South Carolina. Three of these reservoirs (Lake Russell, Lake Thurmond, and Lake Marion) are accessible to the public and two (L-Lake and Par Pond) are located on the U.S. Department of Energy's Savannah River Site (SRS), which is closed to public access. Age-adjusted mercury concentrations were significantly higher in SRS bass compared to the offsite reservoirs. In addition, mercury concentrations were significantly higher in bass from Par Pond compared to L-Lake and in bass from Lakes Russell and Thurmond compared to Lake Marion. No mercury concentrations in excess of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration action level (1.0 mg.kg(-1)) were found in any bass from the public-accessible reservoirs. However, the majority of fish from these reservoirs had mercury concentrations that fall into or exceed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency consumption category of "no more than one per week". In addition, most fish from these reservoirs had mercury levels in excess of those believed to be detrimental to sensitive avian species.

J	Puckridge, JT; Walker, KF; Costelloe, JF				Puckridge, JT; Walker, KF; Costelloe, JF			Hydrological persistence and the ecology of dryland rivers	REGULATED RIVERS-RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT												The flow regime of Cooper Creek, central Australia, is subject to a summer-monsoonal climate and aseasonal cycles associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Analysis of a 48-year hydrograph indicates that floods tend to occur in clusters associated with La Nina episodes. The influence of ENSO is apparent in lagged correlations between discharge and values of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), and in measures of coherency derived from cross-spectrum analysis. Hydrological persistence is indicated by partial auto-correlations between floods in successive years. In a cluster of five floods over 1987-1991, cumulative effects were apparent in wetland habitat areas, in water temperature and transparency, and in the recruitment patterns of five fish species: Nematalosa erebi (Clupeidae), Hypseleotris klunzingeri (Gobiidae), Melanotaenia splendida tatei (Melanotaeniidae), Retropinna semoni (Retropinnidae) and Gambusia holbrooki (Poeciliidae). During serial floods, native fish appear to have a recruitment advantage over the exotic Gambusia. Hydrological persistence and its ecological correlates warrant consideration in research, planning and management, particularly in regard to the water resources of arid and semi-arid regions.

Quantifying the wetland water balance: A new isotope-based approach that includes precipitation and infiltration	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Stable isotopes have been used to quantify lake and wetland pond water loss to evaporation by applying the modified Craig and Gordon (1965) model. This model and its derivatives employ simplifying assumptions that ignore the additions of precipitation and infiltration outputs and assume evaporation is the only loss term over the prediction period. Here we develop a coupled water and isotope mass-balance model to account for precipitation additions. Our model uses physical and isotopic observations to quantify pond evaporation and infiltration losses over the ice-free period. We tested and applied the model to four wetland ponds at the St Denis National Wildlife Research Area, Saskatchewan Canada, where we have long-term datasets. Modeled infiltration rates from the ponds ranged between 0.99 and 9.2 mm/d and open water evaporation rates ranged between 0.88 and 2.8 mm/d. Both were consistent with independent estimates. Infiltration amounts were highest in the ephemeral ponds (that dry out within days or weeks of the spring melt period). In these ponds, infiltration exceeded evaporation. In permanent ponds, that is ponds that do not dry out; evaporation exceeded infiltration. Evaporation amounts were most substantial for permanent ponds that were not sheltered by topography or riparian vegetation. Overall, our coupled water and isotope mass-balance model combined with physical and isotope observations was able to quantify the spatially and temporally variable evaporation and infiltration fluxes within and between ponds.

J	LaBounty, JF				LaBounty, James F.			Secchi transparency of Boulder Basin, Lake Mead, Arizona-Nevada: 1990-2007	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Over 5,500 individual Secchi readings were taken from Boulder Basin of Lake Mead, Nevada-Arizona, between July 1990 and December 2007. Annual and seasonal patterns are plainly displayed by these data. Variations in Secchi depth measurements are both spatial and temporal. Peak water transparency >15 m generally occurs in April and March and at sampling locations along the thalweg of the Colorado River channel in the Outer portion of Boulder Basin. Transparency steadily decreases toward the tributary inflow into Las Vegas Bay. Transparency in open water of Las Vegas Bay ranges from <1 m during the growing season to 5-7 m in winter. These differences are generally driven by varying algal production which decreases in a cline from Las Vegas Bay to the Outer Basin. Entrainment of small sediment particles from the urban inflow also influences water transparency. Steady lowering of the reservoir during the 2000 to 2007 drought exacerbated the influence of turbidity due to entrainment of former lake bottom sediments into the epilimnion. However, the strongest statistical relationships with decreasing Secchi transparency are with chlorophyll a (ch1-a) and total phosphorus (TP). The patterns and relationships presented establish the nature of Boulder Basin's water clarity to 2008 that will be useful in light of imminent and future alterations of the aquatic ecosystem by both anthropogenic and nonanthropogenic factors. Perhaps the largest change will occur due to the recent introduction of the quagga mussel (Dresseina rostriformis bugensis). After discovery in January 2007, the mussel population has been increasing rapidly. The data sets in this presentation form the basis of conditions in Boulder Basin prior to the introduction of quagga mussels.																			1040-2381						2008	24	3					207	218		10.1080/07438140809354062	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140809354062													WOS:000269666500001

We conducted a 3-month mesocosm study to investigate the responses of phytoplankton, zooplankton and Vallisneria spinulosa to different N loading patterns using weekly and monthly additions of in total 14 g N m(-2) month(-1) during the first 2 months. The monthly additions led to higher phytoplankton chlorophyll a and total phytoplankton biomass than at ambient conditions as well as lower leaf biomass and a smaller ramet number of V. spinulosa. Moreover, the biomass of cyanobacteria was higher during summer (August) in the monthly treatments than those with weekly or no additions. However, the biomass of plankton and macrophytes did not differ among the N treatments at the end of the experiment, 1 month after the termination of N addition. We conclude that by stimulating the growth of phytoplankton (cyanobacteria) and reducing the growth of submerged macrophytes, short-term extreme N loading may have significant effects on shallow nutrient-rich lakes and that the lakes may show fast recovery if they are not close to the threshold of a regime shift from a clear to a turbid state.

Understanding its phosphorus budget and the corresponding limitations for research are fundamental to lake management. We have therefore systematically analyzed publications and publicly available datasets regarding Dianchi P pollution since the year 1960 to explore the anthropogenic perturbation on phosphorus budget dynamics. Results show that current exogenous loading (> 600 tons .a(-1)) remains significant; inflow rivers and drainage pipes around the lakeshore are the main pathways (accounting for around 80% of loading). Besides shifts in the spatial-temporal pattern of exogenous loading, artificial treatments have also reshaped P removal patterns; consequently, only a small amount of P can be removed through lake outflows (<20%, around 140 tons .a(-1)). Although a reduction has been observed in exogenous P loading over the past decade, endogenous P loading has significantly increased, of which P flux via sediment release alone approximates more than 180 tons .a(-1) in 2017. Generally, P budget improvements have been due to artificial treatments such as the Niulan River water diversion project, shifting directions on tail water emissions, and sediment dredging projects. However, these treatments also introduce negative consequences and therefore require further caution. The reuse of "waste P" via treatments has especially become a challenge. To date, exogenous loading via atmospheric dry deposition, wintering birds, water diversion, degradation in geological phosphorus-rich regions and endogenous P cycling fluxes, etc., need further study. Here, suggestions for corresponding research are given. It is suggested that the restoration of spontaneous "P balance" in the Dianchi system, and the modification of the regional urban development strategy should present issues facing plateau freshwater lakes in SW China which need to be addressed. Moreover, synthesized analyses and machine learning processes are new attempts worth promoting to other lakes where monitoring data is incomplete.

Evidence for the major role of benthic cysts in providing the inoculum for subsequent growth is given from morphological and quantitative studies over 2 contrasting years of cyst production, 1980 and 1981. For both years there were 2 distinct phases of population increase in the plankton. Low winter densities were followed by rapid rates of increase during Feb. and March at the same time as empty cysts appeared in the sediment. These changes occurred when water temperatures rose from .apprx. 3.degree.-5.degree. C. After near-stationary periods in April and May 1980 and April to June 1981 there followed phases of exponential growth, but at appreciably slower rates of population increase than during recruitment from excystment. That excystment was the major contributor to the rapid vernal increase of planktonic cells is supported by the observation in the plankton to high percentages of preceratium (recently excysted) cells and young vegetative cells with carbohydrate in their posterior halves. Moreover, a calculation of growth rate in situ, from the phasing of cell division when water temperatures were .apprx. 8.degree. C, indicated that vegetative growth was very slow relative to the earlier observed rate of increase. Growth rates in culture at temperatures below 10.degree. C were also very slow. Instead of the usual encystment in 1980 there was an early mass mortality of cells. This failure to form cysts did not prevent recruitment from benthic cysts in 1981 due to the large reservoir of viable cysts in the sediment from earlier years.																			0007-1617						1983	18	1					47	59		10.1080/00071618300650061	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00071618300650061													WOS:A1983QH63900006
J	Hall, RI; Leavitt, PR; Smol, JP; Zirnhelt, N				Hall, RI; Leavitt, PR; Smol, JP; Zirnhelt, N			Comparison of diatoms, fossil pigments and historical records as measures of lake eutrophication	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Analysis of fossil diatoms and pigments was used to examine the effects of land-management practises on the trophic status of Williams Lake, a eutrophic lake in central British Columbia, Canada. Published weighted-average (WA) models were used to infer changes in total phosphorus concentration (TP) during the past 200 years. 2. Diatom-inferred TP (DI-TP) was compared to 20 years of direct chemical TP measurements to determine the accuracy of diatom-TP models in inferring mean summer TP in Williams Lake. Plant pigments were measured using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to quantify historical changes in gross algal community composition and abundance and to evaluate further diatom-TP inferences. 3. Palaeolimnological analyses showed that Williams Lake has been productive throughout the last 200 years. Diatoms characteristic of alkaline, eutrophic conditions were continuously present c. 1765-1990 AD. Carotenoids from filamentous cyanobacteria (myxoxanthophyll, aphanizophyll) were regularly present in Williams Lake sediments, although cryptophytes (alloxanthin), diatoms (diatoxanthin), chlorophytes (lutein-zeaxanthin b-phorbins), and siliceous algae (diatoms, chrysophytes) or dinoflagellates (fucoxanthin) were also important components of past algal communities. Terrestrial disturbance (railway and road constructions, cattle ranching) increased lake production, but resulted in relatively little permanent environmental change. 4. Comparison of DI-TP with measured TP (1972-91) showed that inferences from simple WA models were similar to average summer TP (39.1 vs. 35.2 mu g TP l(-1)). Inferences resulting from data manipulations that down-weighted eutrophic lakes (outlier elimination, bootstrapping) or diatom species (square-root transformation, tolerance-weighting) were weakly and negatively correlated with measured TP, introduced bias into inference models, or underestimated measured TP. These patterns suggest that, when using diatom-TP models developed from sparsely populated regions, accurate palaeoecological inferences for TP in eutrophic lakes should avoid data manipulations which down-weight the most productive sites and taxa. 5. Comparison of DI-TP and fossil-inferred algal abundance during the past 200 years suggested that changes in nutrient inputs accounted for relatively little variation in past algal abundance. Although past changes in total algal biomass (as p-carotene) and DI-TP were broadly similar, the two variables were not significantly correlated (alpha = 0.05). In contrast, changes in DI-TP were significantly correlated with mean concentrations of diatom-specific carotenoids (diatoxanthin), although the explanatory power was low (r(2) = 0.16). These patterns suggest that the DI-TP model reflects more closely environmental conditions in Williams Lake during periods of diatom growth, and not necessarily those when total algal biomass is greatest.

Lake water concentrations of total P (TP) have increased since the 1990s but were not correlated with catchment inputs, which showed no trend.The characteristics of internal loading of P have changed since the mid-1990s, with an earlier and larger mass of P released from the sediments each summer. Catchment inputs of total oxidised N (NOx) decreased from the peak value of 10,186T/yr in 1995 to 5,396T/yr in 2011, coinciding with a reduction in lake water concentrations. External inputs and lake concentrations of NOx were highly correlated (R=0.88). Water temperature increased approximately 1C and was a predictor of variation in chl-a from 1974 to 2012. After the peak chl-a concentration in 1993, dissolved inorganic N (DIN) also became an important predictor, accounting for almost half of the 44% variance explained by a hierarchical partition model. Decreasing log (DIN:TP) ratios suggest that N limitation of chl-a has become more important in the lake recently.																			0791-7945	2009-003X					2021	121B	1					47	60		10.3318/BIOE.2021.04	http://dx.doi.org/10.3318/BIOE.2021.04													WOS:000668750600005
J	Shi, W; Wang, MH; Li, JS				Shi, Wei; Wang, Menghua; Li, Junsheng			Water property in high-altitude Qinghai Lake in China	SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING												Qinghai Lake in China, which is located at an altitude of 3260 m, is the highest inland lake among the 50 largest lakes in the world. Therefore, satellite measurement of water quality is the most important and feasible tool for routinely assessing the water property and its variations in Qinghai Lake. We derive the normalized water-leaving radiance spectra nL(w)(lambda) in Qinghai Lake from measurements of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), after accurately computing the top-of-atmosphere Rayleigh radiances in the satellite Level-1 to Level-2 ocean color data processing. Satellite-derived nL(w)(lambda) spectra, chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, and the water diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm, K-d(490), in the period of 2012-2018 are used to evaluate and understand the dynamics of water properties in Qinghai Lake. Results show that VIIRS-measured nL(w)(lambda) spectra match quite well with the in situ data, e.g., the mean and median ratios of the VIIRS-derived and in situ-measured nL(w)(lambda) at 443 nm are 0.9741 and 0.9898, respectively. Enhanced nL(w)(lambda) at 486 nm and 551 nm can be observed from satellite-derived nL(w)(lambda) spectra for the entire lake. VIIRS-derived nL(w)(lambda) spectra show significant seasonal cycles. High nL(w)(lambda) values occur in July while low values occur in April. Results also show the seasonal and interannual changes of Chl-a and K-d(490) in Qinghai Lake. Low Chl-a and K-d(490) are normally observed in April, and they typically peak in the early summer. Peculiarly, however, anomaly high values in Chl-a and K-d(490) occurred in June 2016. The analysis of empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) shows the dominant modes for Chla and K-d(490) are interannual modes that account for about 79.1% and 31.5% of the their total variances, respectively. The second EOF mode for Chl-a and K-d(490) shows the seasonal changes, and contributes to about 6.1% and 14.0% of their respective total variances.

An experimental apparatus of a new thrust flow transducer based on particle phase properties is proposed in this paper. The pull force on a traction cable produced by the floating ball in a fluid can be measured by our experimental apparatus. Then the forces produced on the rigid floating ball are used to calculate the fluid thrust. Finally, the flow velocity can be obtained using an empirical formulation between the fluid velocity and the thrust on the floating ball. Such a designed thrust flow transducer is simple and low cost and can be used not only for measuring the surface velocity of rivers, water channels, lakes, and oceans, but also for automatic measurements of water velocity, including of frazil slush that is under the ice sheet in rivers, water channels, lakes, and oceans in freezing conditions.																			0090-3973	1945-7553				NOV	2013	41	6					894	897		10.1520/JTE20120365	http://dx.doi.org/10.1520/JTE20120365													WOS:000327414700006

The special regulation required anglers to harvest the first 25 crappie, regardless of size, with no catch-and-release or culling. Anglers (364 parties, 750 anglers) seeking crappie were asked questions regarding their awareness, their acceptance and how they learned of the regulation during access point creel surveys, December through February, 1991-92 and 1992-93. A majority of the parties were aware (98.6%) and in favor (94.5%) of the regulation. The TPWD Texas Fishing Guide, local newspaper articles, and word-of-mouth were most often cited as the source of information. This study justifies efforts to educate the public regarding fishery management practices.																									1994							447	452																WOS:A1994BJ69M00054

Saving threatened plant species: Reintroduction of Hill's thistle (Cirsium hillii. (Canby) Fernald) to its natural habitat	PLOS ONE												Hill's thistle (Cirsium hillii (Canby) Fernald) is a perennial plant endemic to the Great Lakes region of North America. Hill's thistle is listed as threatened in Ontario and Canada where it is found in globally rare alvar habitats. The main objective of this study was ex-situ conservation of Hill's thistle using in vitro culture techniques and reintroduction of micropropagated plants back to their natural habitat in Bruce Peninsula National Park, Ontario, Canada. Two out of twenty-nine available seeds were successfully germinated under in vitro condition. An efficient micropropagation protocol was optimized with 100% survival during acclimatization of plantlets in the greenhouse. Three hundred micropropagated plants were reintroduced to twelve different sites within Bruce Peninsula National Park in June and July 2017. Plants were monitored for survival, rosette growth, and flowering on all sites from 2017-2019. After four months of planting, 67 to 99% of the plants were alive in different sites and 90 to 99% of them survived over winter. In the following years, shoot regeneration and flowering were observed on most sites. This study further confirms the benefit of plant tissue culture techniques to ensure revival of Hill's thistle ecological biodiversity through the reintroduction of micropropagated plants. This approach consisting of the components of conservation, propagation, and reintroduction (CPR) may potentially serve as a model for saving and enriching other species at risk.

In the fall of 2009, this lake experienced its first bloom of the dinoflagellate Heterocapsa circularisquama, which selectively kills bivalve mollusks. This species has been detected exclusively in southwestern Japan. The completely unexpected outbreak of H. circularisquama in the northern region is believed to have been caused by the contamination of purchased seedlings with this species. The water quality and nutrient data collected by our group from July through October over the past 10 years revealed that the environment of Lake Kamo has not changed significantly. However, in the open water around Sado Island, where Lake Kamo is located, the water temperature has increased by 1.80 degrees C in the last 100 years, which is equivalent to 2-3-fold the world average. This has resulted in a rise in the sea level, which is expected to further deteriorate the water exchange between Lake Kamo and the open sea and low dissolved oxygen in the bottom layer of the Lake and the associated dissolution of nutrients from the bottom sediment. Therefore, seawater exchange has become insufficient and the lake has become nutrient rich, making it prone to the establishment of microorganisms, such as H. circularisquama, once they have been introduced. We developed a method to mitigate the damage caused by the bloom by spraying sediments containing the H. circularisquama RNA virus (HcRNAV), which infects H. circularisquama. After similar to 10 years of performing various verification tests, including field trials, this method was used at the Lake in 2019. During the 2019 H. circularisquama growth season, a small amount of sediment containing HcRNAV was sprayed on the lake three times, which resulted in a decrease in H. circularisquama and an increase in HcRNAV, indicating that this method is effective in diminishing the bloom.																			2167-8359					MAY 11	2023	11								e14813	10.7717/peerj.14813	http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.14813								37193035					WOS:000996408100005

A review of the effects of Bythotrephes longimanus and calcium decline on zooplankton communities - can interactive effects be predicted?	ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS												Anthropogenic stressors including acid deposition, invasive species, and calcium (Ca) decline have produced widespread damage to Canadian Shield lakes, especially to their zooplankton communities. Here, we review current knowledge on the individual effects on zooplankton by the non-indigenous predator Bythotrephes longimanus and Ca decline; we identify knowledge gaps in this literature and examine the likely interactive impacts of Bythotrephes invasions and Ca decline on zooplankton. The negative impacts of Bythotrephes longimanus on zooplankton communities are well known, whereas current understanding of the effects of declining Ca on zooplankton is restricted to Daphnia spp.; hence, there is a large knowledge gap on how declining Ca may affect zooplankton communities in general. The co-occurring impacts of Bythotrephes and declining Ca have rarely been studied at the species level, and we expect daphniids, particularly Daphnia retrocurva and Daphnia pulicaria, to be the most sensitive to both stressors. We also expect a synergistic negative interaction on cladocerans in lakes with both stressors, leaving a community dominated by Holopedium glacialis and (or) copepods. Our predictions form testable hypotheses but since species and ecosystem response to multiple stressors are difficult to predict, we may actually see ecological surprises in Canadian Shield lakes as Bythotrephes continues to spread and Ca levels continue to fall.

For PCR, DNA extracted from water samples was tested for presence of V. cholerae and genes coding for selected virulence factors. Vibrio cholerae non-O1/non-O139 was routinely isolated by culture from all three lakes; whereas V. cholerae O1 and O139 were not. Water samples collected during the summer months from Lisi Lake and Kumisi Lake were positive for both V. cholerae and V. cholerae ctxA, tcpA, zot, ompU and toxR by PCR. Water samples collected during the same period from both Lisi and Kumisi Lake were also positive for V. cholerae serogroup O1 by DFA. All of the samples were negative for V. cholerae serotype O139. The results of this study provide evidence for an environmental presence of toxigenic V. cholerae O1, which may represent a potential source of illness as these lakes serve as recreational water in Tbilisi, Georgia.					; Janelidze, Nino/LDF-3821-2024	Tediashvili, Marina/0000-0003-4035-4746; Janelidze, Nino/0000-0001-5417-7512; 													1758-2229					FEB	2010	2	1			SI		2	6		10.1111/j.1758-2229.2009.00073.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1758-2229.2009.00073.x								23765992					WOS:000279431900001
J	Beimel, S; Suari, Y; Gabbay, F				Beimel, Stav; Suari, Yair; Gabbay, Freddy			Improving Weather Forecasts for Sailing Events Using a Combination of a Numerical Forecast Model and Machine Learning Postprocessing	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												Accurate predictions of wind and other weather phenomena are essential for making informed strategic and tactical decisions in sailing. Sailors worldwide utilize current state-of-the-art forecasts, yet such forecasts are often insufficient because they do not offer the high temporal and geographic resolution required by sailors. This paper examines wind forecasting in competitive sailing and demonstrates that traditional wind forecasts can be improved for sailing events by using an integration of traditional numerical modeling and machine learning (ML) methods. Our primary objective is to provide practical and more precise wind forecasts that will give sailors a competitive edge. As a case study, we demonstrate the capabilities of our proposed methods to improve wind forecasting at Lake Kinneret, a popular sailing site. The lake wind pattern is highly influenced by the area's topographic features and is characterized by unique local and mesoscale phenomena at different times of the day. In this research, we simulate the Kinneret wind during the summers of 2015-2021 in up to one-kilometer resolution using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) atmospheric model. The results are used as input for convolutional neural network (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) ML models to postprocess and improve the WRF model accuracy. These advanced ML models are trained using training datasets based on the WRF data as well as real data measured by the meteorological service, and subsequently, a validation process of the trained ML model is performed on unseen datasets against site-specific meteorological service observations. Through our experimental analysis, we demonstrate the limitations of the WRF model. It uncovers notable biases in wind direction and velocity, particularly a persistent northern bias in direction and an overestimation of wind strength. Despite its inherent limitations, this study demonstrates that the integration of ML models can potentially improve wind forecasting due to the remarkable prediction accuracy rate achieved by the CNN model, surpassing 95%, while achieving partial success for the MLP model. Furthermore, a successful CNN-based preliminary forecast was effectively generated, suggesting its potential contribution to the future development of a user-friendly tool for sailors.					; Gabbay, Freddy/OHR-2653-2025	Gabbay, Freddy/0000-0002-6549-7957; Suari, Yair/0000-0002-7632-2423														2076-3417				APR	2024	14	7							2950	10.3390/app14072950	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app14072950													WOS:001201097400001

Freshwater ecosystems around the world have been investigated for the distribution of cyanobacteria and their toxins and the effects they have on the ecosystems. Similar research was performed on the Fehervarcsurgo reservoir in Hungary during 2018. Cyanobacteria were present and blooming, and the highest abundance was recorded in July (2,822,000 cells/mL). The species present were Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, Microcystis flos-aquae, Microcystis wesenbergii, Cuspidothrix issatschenkoi, Dolichospermum flos-aquae, and Snowella litoralis. In July and September, the microcystin encoding gene mcyE and the saxitoxin encoding gene sxtG were amplified in the biomass samples. While a low concentration of microcystin-RR was found in one water sample from July, analyses of Abramis brama and Carassius gibelio caught from the reservoir did not show the presence of the investigated microcystins in the fish tissue. However, several histopathological changes, predominantly in gills and kidneys, were observed in the fish, and the damage was more severe during May and especially July, which coincides with the increase in cyanobacterial biomass during the summer months. Cyanobacteria may thus have adverse effects in this ecosystem.					; Kitanović, Nevena/AAM-3141-2021; Marinovic, Zoran/AAH-3677-2019; Meriluoto, Jussi/A-5309-2008; Tokodi, Nada/X-2635-2019	Dulic, Tamara/0000-0001-8296-1638; Drobac Backovic, Damjana/0000-0002-5500-0038; Simic, Snezana B./0000-0003-3273-2858; Svircev, Zorica/0000-0001-8355-7661; Lujic, Jelena/0000-0003-2488-7403; Dordevic, Nevena/0000-0003-1272-7349; Meriluoto, Jussi/0000-0002-6300-301X; Tokodi, Nada/0000-0002-9365-8770; Kitanovic, Nevena/0000-0003-4090-1260													0167-6369	1573-2959				SEP	2021	193	9							554	10.1007/s10661-021-09324-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09324-3								34357469					WOS:000692315700002
J	Retallack, GJ				Retallack, Gregory J.			The oldest known paleosol profiles on Earth: 3.46 Ga Panorama Formation, Western Australia	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Subaerial volcanic flank and floodplain facies of the 3.46 Ga Panorama Formation have been recognized on the basis of trough cross-bedded sandstones, lapilli tuffs, and abundant nodularized barite sand crystals, like those noted in other Archean non-marine facies. These barite-nodular layers are interpreted as alluvial paleosols for the following reasons. They show different degree of bedding disruption scaled to nodule size beneath a sharp upper boundary, like desert soil profiles. They show multiple generations of cracking, clay skins, and up-profile destruction of feldspar and rock fragments, compatible with weathering of labile constituents of the parent material. Loss of alkali and alkaline earth elements and phosphorus up profile are also features of chemical weathering. Geochemical mass balance calculations (tau analysis) shows that the profiles lost mass and labile elements, unlike unaltered sediments and tuffs. Rare earth element analysis also shows light rare earth retention as in weathering, as opposed to sedimentation or hydrothermal alteration. Barite of nodules in the paleosols is mobilized to concentration under very acidic conditions (pH < 3) and is very stable under less acidic conditions. These Archean alluvial paleosols may have formed by acid sulfate weathering by sulfuric acid, rather than the currently more common hydrolysis by carbonic acid. This archaic system of widespread acid sulfate weathering has since been marginalized to a few playa lakes, deep water tables, and sulfur springs.

J	Shuval, HI				Shuval, HI			Are the conflicts between Israel and her neighbors over the waters of the Jordan River Basin an obstacle to peace? Israel-Syria as a case study	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION					7th International Conference of the Israel-Society-for-Ecology-and-Environmental-Quality-Sciences	JUN 13-18, 1999	JERUSALEM, ISRAEL	Israel Soc Ecol & Environm Qual Sci, Int Water Assoc, Int Water Resources Assoc, Int Assoc Water Law				Are the conflicts over water resources between Syria, Lebanon and Israel who share the transboundary waters of the Jordan River Basin a major obstacle to the peace process? The Syrians and Lebanese have in the past claimed as their own all of the sources of the Jordan River which arise in their territory. International water law provides a strong legal basis to assure the water rights and continued use of water by a downstream riparian, such as Syria's use of the Euphrates which arises in Turkey and similarly, Israel's use of the Jordan River, based on prior use in an international river basin. This paper will evaluate the water security implications for Israel of a possible peace agreement with Syria and Lebanon which would involve Israel forgoing the continued use of those amounts of water from the Jordan River that were approved by the Israel Government under the so-called Johnston Plan of 1956 - 35 million m(3)/yr. for Lebanon from the Hasbani Springs and 42 mm(3)/yr. from the Banias Springs and Jordan River for Syria. The maximum replacement cost for that amount of water by desalination of seawater may be about $0.70/m(3) or, some $56,000,000 per year. This is not a great amount of money as part of the price for peace. The paper also shows that Israel does not have to hold on to the entire area of the Golan Heights to assure its water security and that a 1-3 km water security zone along the Syrian side of the international border under joint and international inspection can be an effective water security measure to assure inspection, monitoring and control of all the sources of the Jordan River and Lake Kinneret vital to Israel's water security. The scare stories published by some groups in Israel, that Syria could, after a peace agreement is signed, covertly divert essentially all of Israel's water resources derived from the sources of the Jordan River or 30% of the country's water supply are highly unrealistic. Such major works could not go undetected and Syria and the world recognize that such an act would be viewed as a causus belli and as an act of war by Israel. In an era of peace, development of the shared water resources of the Jordan and continuous water systems in a program of regional cooperation can bring benefits to all of the partners on the Jordan River Basin.																			0049-6979					OCT	2000	123	1-4					605	630		10.1023/A:1005285504188	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1005285504188													WOS:000089881000048
J	Nishri, A; Herman, G; Shlichter, M				Nishri, A; Herman, G; Shlichter, M			The response of the sedimentological regime in Lake Kinneret to lower lake levels	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The surface level of Lake Kinneret is regulated to remain between -209 m and -213 m msl. During the stratified period, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), ammonium (NH4+) and dissolved sulphide (H2S) accumulate in the hypolimnion. The concentration of these solutes, which are direct and indirect products of the decomposition of organic matter, increase considerably in summers with lower lake levels. A numerical model describing depth-averaged hypolimnion and epilimnion current velocities for high and low lake levels was adapted for Lake Kinneret. Simulated hypolimnetic currents were shown to be stronger for low lake levels as a result of the fact that low lake levels are characterized by a thinner hypolimnion while the thickness of the epilimnion remains unchanged. We suggest that the stronger hypolimnetic currents have the following consequences: 1. turbulence is induced, 2. the enhanced turbulence results in higher resuspension, 3. because SO4= is available to bacteria on resuspended particles, mineralization rates are enhanced, and 4. focusing of fine sediments and associated organic matter to the pelagic zone is enhanced.																			0018-8158					NOV 15	1996	339	1-3					149	160		10.1007/BF00008923	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008923													WOS:A1996WC90400018

Younger Dryas silty sediments at the base of the core are characterized by low diversity of aquatic organisms. The transition to the Holocene is indicated by a sharp change from silt to clay-gyttja. The migration and expansion of trees at lower elevations between 10200 and 8500 C-14-yr BP, along with higher diversities and concentrations of aquatic organisms and the decreased proportion of north-alpine diatoms, point to rapidly rising summer temperatures. After 6500 C-14-yr BP the expansion of Pinus mugo in the catchment coincides with signs of natural eutrophication as recorded by an increase of planktonic diatoms. In the late Holocene ( 4000-0 C-14-yr BP) Pinus peuce and Abies are reduced and Picea expands. Cereal grains and disturbance indicators suggest late-Holocene human modification of the vegetation.																			0921-2728					JUL	2003	30	1					95	111		10.1023/A:1024746818627	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1024746818627													WOS:000184172900006

However, little is known about the attitudes and preferences of channel catfish anglers. We used data from the 1995 Kansas Licensed Angler Survey to evaluate the variation among channel catfish, crappie Pomoxis spp., largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, and walleye Stizostedion vitreum anglers with respect to when, where, and how they fish. Anglers were grouped into categories based on their response to which species they preferred to catch. Channel catfish anglers had lower gross annual income and had completed less education than other angler types. In addition, channel catfish anglers fished more during summer months and at night than crappie, largemouth bass, and walleye anglers. Channel catfish anglers were less likely to use a boat than other angler types, and indicated that shore fishing opportunities were important. Identifying diversity among anglers allows managers to make more informed management decisions regarding resource availability and demand. For example, maintaining fishing access points for shore fishing and not closing lakes to fishing after dark should benefit channel catfish anglers in Kansas.																			0892-2284		1-888569-19-0				1999	24						427	433																WOS:000086864000039

We used this protocol as a measure of responsiveness of the adrenocortical cells to acute stress in general and for comparison with gender and across seasons. In both sexes the adrenocortical response to stress was reduced in January (at Fairbanks, 64 degrees N) and maximal when birds were breeding in June at Toolik Lake (69 degrees N). The elevation of circulating corticosterone following capture and handling in breeding males at Barrow (71 degrees N) was significantly less than in breeding males at Toolik Lake. There were also considerable variations among individuals in the intensity of the adrenocortical responses, particularly in the maximum levels of corticosterone attained. This individual variation correlated significantly with fat score and/or body mass in both sexes only in breeding birds at Barrow. This difference may be explained by generally lower, and thus reduced variability in body fat and mass in birds sampled in the warmer climate of Toolik Lake. A similar trend was seen in non-breeding birds, but this was not significant. Additionally, in January, baseline cortisterone levels in males were correlated with body mass, although this relationship did not hold when both sexes were considered. Body mass and fat score in winter were similar to those of redpolls sampled at Barrow in June. These data suggest that redpolls may be able to adjust their responsiveness to acute stresses in relation to fat stores. Those with greater fat depots had reduced responsiveness to stress.

J	Cortés, A; MacIntyre, S; Sadro, S				Cortes, Alicia; MacIntyre, Sally; Sadro, Steven			Flowpath and retention of snowmelt in an ice-covered arctic lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The extent to which snowmelt flowing into ice-covered lakes spreads horizontally and mixes vertically influences retention of solutes derived from the landscape. To quantify these transport processes and retention, we combine time series temperature and specific conductance measurements in Toolik Lake (Alaska) and its major inflow, with measurements of discharge and meteorology, and profiles of specific conductance, temperature, fluorescence, chlorophyll a, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in spring of 3 yr. During early snowmelt, the concentration of DOC in the stream was 750 mu M, twice that in the lake. During slow melt (discharge (Q)< 4 m(3) s(-1)), the incoming solute-rich intrusion spread lakewide below the ice. During melt with Q > 6 m(3) s(-1), the incoming water partially flushed the inlet basin and the more dilute water flowed over the original intrusion with a preferential flowpath to the outlet. Penetrative convection was restricted by the increased density gradients from the incoming plume and initially constrained to shallow mixing zones associated with the step changes in density. As ice thickness decreased to less than 1 m, heating caused density instabilities at the base of the intrusions that mixed solutes similar to 10 m vertically, contributing to retention. Near-surface layers enriched with DOC persisted for similar to 10 d during a rapid melt and for over 3 weeks when the melt was slow. Retention, of order 10-20%, also depended on the rapidity of melt and magnitude of discharge.					; Sadro, Steven/AGC-7944-2022	Sadro, Steven/0000-0002-6416-3840; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	2017	62	5					2023	2044		10.1002/lno.10549	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10549													WOS:000410726500015

Evaluation of the ornithogenic influence on the trophic state of East Mediterranean wetland ecosystem using trend analysis	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The Great Rift Valley portion of the East African-Eurasian Migratory Flyway is extremely important globally because of the numbers (>500 million) and diversity of seasonal traveling birds. The construction of the Agmon wetland (1.1 km(2)) in the Hula Valley, Israel in 1994 and a change in crop type and rotation has attracted increasing number of Eurasian cranes (Grus grus) to winter in the wetland (>40,000 in 2014). The birds are fed in an area of 100 ha and roost during the night in the wetland for protection from predators. Feeding practices have yielded an eco-tourism bonanza with over 400,000 visitors annually. However, this practice may have negative impacts on the trophic state of the wetland. We performed trend analyses using monthly means of selected constituents collected from mid-1994 to 2014. The temporal distribution of TN and TP concentrations in the inlets did not change with time. The concentrations of TN and TP in the outlet increased significantly during the earlier monitoring period. Kendall-Theil regression showed that TP concentrations in the outlet increased significantly from a monthly mean of 180 mu g L-1 in 2010 to a monthly mean of 260 mu g L-1 in 2014. Similarly, the results of chlorophyll a concentrations in the outlet showed a sharp upturn in the latter part of the series from a mean of 66 mg L-1 in 2010 to a mean of 122 mg L-1 in 2014. The concurrent increase of TP and chlorophyll a, the two most important parameters affecting a waterbody trophic index coincided with the observed increase in the number of roosting cranes in the wetland. Hence, we assume that the continued increases in TP concentrations could transform the wetland from a mild eutrophic to a permanent hypereutrophic state. Reducing the number of roosting cranes may prevent this from happening. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Holloway, S				Holloway, S			Safety of the underground disposal of carbon dioxide	ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT					3rd International Conference on Carbon Dioxide Removal (ICCDR-3)	SEP 09-11, 1996	CAMBRIDGE, MA					The risks associated with the transport and injection of carbon dioxide are reasonably well understood and already borne in the USA. There is a remote possibility that CO2 disposed of underground could leak from a storage reservoir, either through an unidentified migration pathway or as the result of a well failure. The kind of threat that this might represent may be judged by comparison with naturally occurring volcanic CO2 emissions. Diffuse CO2 emissions through the soil or via carbonated springs in volcanic areas do not appear to represent a threat as long as the CO2 is able to disperse into the atmosphere. However, when CO2 is able to build up in enclosed spaces it poses a definite threat. Large CO2 clouds associated with sudden emissions from volcanic vents or craters also pose a lethal threat. However, there appears to be little analogy between such events and any possible leak from a storage reservoir via a natural unidentified migration pathway. Modelling of the development, migration and subsequent dispersal of any CO2 cloud which might arise from a well failure is recommended.

J	Chandran, A; Mazumder, A				Chandran, A.; Mazumder, A.			Investigation on the temporal variation and source tracking of faecal bacteria in a forest dominated watershed (Comox Lake), British Columbia, Canada	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY												Aims: The aims of this study were to investigate the temporal variation in Escherichia coli density and its sources at the drinking water intake of Comox Lake for a period of 3 years (2011-2013). Methods and Results: Density of E. coli was assessed by standard membrane filtration method. Source tracking of E. coli were done by using BOX-A1Rbased rep-PCR DNA fingerprinting method. Over the years, the mean E. coli density ranged from nondetectable to 9.8 CFU 100 ml(-1). The density of E. coli in each of the years did not show any significant difference (P > 0.05); however, a comparatively higher density was observed during the fall. Wildlife was (64.28%, 153/238) identified as the major contributing source of E. coli, followed by human (18.06%, 43/238) and unknown sources (17.64%, 42/238). Although the sources were varied by year and season, over all, the predominant contributing sources were black bear, human, unknown, elk, horse and gull. Conclusions: The findings of this investigation identified the multiple animal sources contributing faecal bacteria into the drinking water intake of Comox Lake and their varying temporal occurrence. Significance and Impact of the Study: The results of this study can reliably inform the authorities about the most vulnerable period (season) of faecal bacterial loading and their potential sources in the lake for improving risk assessment and pollution mitigation.																			1364-5072	1365-2672				DEC	2015	119	6					1718	1728		10.1111/jam.12969	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.12969								26456882					WOS:000367685800024

Although its water temperatures often exceed 40A degrees C, a particular lineage of 'dwarf' tilapia, Alcolapia grahami, has evolved remarkable adaptations to survive in this hostile environment. Magadi tilapia exists in small fragmented populations in isolated lagoons within Lake Magadi and its satellite Lake, Little Magadi. In spite of the potential this tilapia holds for understanding evolutionary processes in stressful environments, few genetic studies have focused on this species. We examined the genetic diversity and spatial genetic relationships of Magadi tilapia populations using microsatellite and mitochondrial markers. High levels of genetic variation were found to be supporting the hypothesis that A. grahami populations represent remnants of a much larger fish population that inhabited paleo-lake Orolonga. In contrast to previous studies, we found a well-supported genetic structure of A. grahami consisting of three differentiated genetic clusters (a) Little Magadi, (b) Fish Spring Lagoon and (c) Rest of Magadi. Given the importance of this species to the Magadi ecosystem and its potential evolutionary significance, the three genetic clusters should be considered as separate gene pools and conservation strategies aimed at protecting the species based on these clusters are recommended.

Mass-based N and P concentrations during summer (from June to September) in both species were rather higher than those of British, European and American wetland species. However, both N- and P-limitations were found in both species during the sampling period. It has been found that transitional strategy between CS and C strategies (C/CS) was common for the two species, whilst T. latifolia individuals in Cernek Lake exhibited CS strategy. N resorption was incomplete in Cernek and Uzun Lakes in both species. P resorption was complete in Uzun Lake for both species, whereas P resorption was intermediate in Cernek Lake, but more proficient for T. latifolia.

Results showed regular unimodal n-alkanes distribution in range of C-16-C-33 with strong predominance of odd-numbered n-alkanes, maximizing at C-29. The delta N-15 for SON were uniformly low, ranging from -6.7 parts per thousand to 3.8 parts per thousand and C/N ratios ranged from 6.6 to 10.0, suggesting that most of organic matter was influenced by terrestrial characteristics of the watershed. The delta C-13 for C-27 to C-31 n-alkanes and for SOC varied from -32.9 parts per thousand to -26.6 parts per thousand and -23.4 parts per thousand to -21.6 parts per thousand, respectively, falling within the range of corresponding n-alkanes in leaves mainly from C-3 land plants. The values of C/N, CPI, OEP, ACL and C-27/C-31 exhibit similar temporal changes with the primary production, showing enhanced eutrophication resulted from increased anthropogenic activities in Shijiu lake from 1852 to 2010.

One weak point has been that very few gravity observations have been available over Lake Vanern, Sweden's largest lake. During the extremely cold winters 2010 and 2011, the ice became sufficiently thick to make ice observation of gravity. The main purpose of this paper is to present the 2011 ice gravity campaign, summarise the experiences made and investigate how much the new ice observations improve the computed quasigeoid model in the area. This is investigated under the assumption that a modern Earth Gravitational Model based on GRACE and GOCE is used. It is found that new ice measurements improve the quasigeoid with a RMS of about 2-3 cm in and around the lake with a maximum improvement of 7 cm.																			0939-9585		978-3-319-10837-7; 978-3-319-10836-0				2014	141						171	177		10.1007/978-3-319-10837-7_22	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-10837-7_22													WOS:000358612900022

Lake Telmen is a saline (presently 4 g l(-1)) closed-basin lake and is therefore sensitive to changes in effective moisture balance. Between 7110 and 6260 cal yr ago, conditions in the Lake Telmen region were hyperarid and a small saline (approximately 20 g l(-1)) lake was present. Increased effective moisture balance but still arid conditions prevailed between 6260 and 4390 cal yr ago. Since 4390 cal yr ago, generally more humid conditions prevailed in the Lake Telmen region. As the lake deepened, a hypoxic hypolimnion became established below a well-developed summer thermocline resulting in varved sediment accumulation since 4390 cal yr ago. Between about 27 10 and 1260 cal yr ago, a greater than present-day effective moisture balance is recorded by a series of four lake highstand terraces. Sedimentologic profiles from lacustrine cores suggest an increase in effective moisture during the past approximately 680 cal yr. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The data provide a Holocene record of vegetation and fire in an area where few records exist. Swamp initiation at Big Willum began prior to 8000 cal. BP, with swamp-like conditions maintained until 2200 cal. BP, after which it became a permanent deep water body, reaching its present day extent between 600-400 cal. BP. From 7000-1200 cal. BP the surrounding woodland was essentially stable. Fire is present throughout the record, with only one period of pronounced burning outside of the historic period, at around 1000 cal. BP, leading to a slightly more open understorey/woodland. The hydrological change at 2200 cal. BP that led to Big Willum becoming a more permanent water body overlaps with the end of the most intensive period of shell mound formation and the commencement of earth mound building at nearby Wathayn. This is suggestive that change in, or diversification of mound types may in part be linked to environmental transformations in the late Holocene. One possibility is that greater water security allowed for increasing and more permanent exploitation of inland locations.					; Rowe, Cassandra/M-6009-2015	Stevenson, Janelle/0000-0001-9640-7275; Rowe, Cassandra/0000-0001-8938-5733													0312-2417	2470-0363				JUN	2015		80					17	31																WOS:000356203200003

In recent decades, a number of non-native fish species have been introduced into the lake intentionally or accidentally while human-accelerated eutrophication has been occurring. In this study, we provided a whole-lake assessment of species composition and abundance of the accidentally-introduced fishes, and described the spatial variability of invasive small fish community in relation to eight physicochemical environmental factors. Fish were sampled quantitatively at 30 sites throughout the lake with multiple mesh-sized gillnets in the autumn of 2008. A total of 2,050 individuals from seven non-native small fish species were captured. Thin sharpbelly Toxabramis swinhonis and piper halfbeak Hyporhamphus intermedius were recognized as dominant species, followed by barcheek goby Rhinogobius giurinus, topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva and redfin culter Culterichthys erythropterus, according to their abundance and occurrence. Principal component analysis (PCA) suggested that the fish community structure in the northern part was distinct from those in the middle and southern parts of the lake, corresponding to the increase of lake eutrophic level from south to north. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that redfin culter, piper halfbeak and thin sharpbelly were positively related to nutrient variables (total phosphorus, total nitrogen), while topmouth gudgeon and barcheek goby were associated with relatively higher secchi depth and lower nutrition level. Water depth seemed to have moderately negative influence on spatial distribution of all the fish species. Regression tree analysis was applied to visualize decision rules for the prediction of fish abundances (CPUE, ind/fishing pass/h) from key environment variables, and explained 51.5-69.0 % of the total variance of response values. The details of these findings are beneficial to understanding the establishment of invasive fish in degraded environment, and to developing suitable conservation strategies for the restoration and management of fish resources in Lake Dianchi as well as the other lakes of Yunnan Plateau.

Although critical to aquatic ecosystems, marine snow can potentially compromise underwater computer vision tasks. This works begins with a survey of techniques for overcoming such issues. Since many recent techniques rely on machine learning, which in turn relies on large amounts of training data, we also survey current approaches at generating such data. After discussing opportunities in existing approaches, we present novel solutions for simulation, isolation, and removal of marine snow in both images and video. Unlike other approaches, we focus on simulating marine snow in industrial scenarios with moving cameras and photorealistic discoloration, lens distortion, and motion blur typical in imagery collected by underwater robots. To remove the marine snow, we use only synthetic data, including a new dataset that we share online, to train a convolutional autoencoder extended to consider temporal information in consecutive video frames. Experiments are then conducted on two real datasets one collected by an autonomous underwater vehicle in a shallow lake and the other by a remotely-operated vehicle in the deep sea.

This study establishes the long term and regional patterns of abundance at breeding and feeding localities, which might in tum be related to diet. Birds were regularly observed and counted at a variety of feeding sites, and some aspects of their breeding success and fledgling diet evaluated at the largest N.Ireland breeding colony. Numbers of breeding birds increased dramatically over a period of eight years but recently show signs of declining. There is likely to be a dynamic relationship between populations of a tapeworm (Ligula intestinalis L.), the numbers of roach (Rutilus rutilus [L.]) and cormorant populations feeding at Lough Neagh, the largest lake in the British Isles. While roach are not a major component in the diet of fledglings, the large numbers of cormorants feeding at the perimeter of L. Neagh suggest that changes in roach populations will affect birds most acutely during or following the winter. We suggest that this might result in a reduction in the proportion of the population volunteering to breed in the subsequent season, but require further data. The longer term effects of one fish species on cormorant populations are unlikely to be critical, since these birds are highly opportunist. In other habitats cormorant numbers are either very stable (estuary) or variable (river) depending on the seasonal and annual availability of their prey. There is no evidence for a systematic seasonal shift in habitat, as suggested by other studies.																			0018-8158					APR 1	1994	279						91	100		10.1007/BF00027844	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00027844													WOS:A1994NK39900010

A 4000-year record of hydrologic variability from the Olympic Mountains, Washington, USA	HOLOCENE												Sedimentological and geochemical analyses of gravity and piston cores retrieved from Lake Quinault, Washington, reveal an similar to 4000-year flood-dominated depositional record. Individual flood event layers are identified by combining core stratigraphy, sedimentology, and the ratio of incoherent to coherently scattered x-ray radiation (inc/coh) from mu XRF (x-ray fluorescence) core scans. The inc/coh time series is used as a proxy for sediment grain size and, in combination with radiocarbon-anchored core age-depth models, enables the reconstruction of late-Holocene hydrologic variability for the Quinault River catchment. Decadal to centennial variability in inc/coh is interpreted to reflect trends in ocean-atmosphere teleconnections favorable for the formation of land-falling atmospheric rivers along the Pacific Ocean flank of the Olympic Mountains. Such processes likely modulate the rate of flooding and may explain notable increases in the frequency of flood event layers observed during the periods 2350-2450 cal. yr BP and the most recent century (AD 1910-2010). Understanding past hydrologic variability has important implications for the landscape and ecosystem response of Olympic Mountain catchments to future climate warming.

J	Edgett, KS; Christensen, PR				Edgett, KS; Christensen, PR			Rocks and aeolian features in the Mars Pathfinder landing site region: Viking infrared thermal mapper observations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS												Albedo, rock abundance, and thermal inertia derived from Viking infrared thermal mapper observations provide information about the surface materials within the Mars Pathfinder landing ellipse in Ares Vallis. Relative to the rest of Mars, the site has an intermediate albedo (0.19-0.23), intermediate-to-high bulk thermal inertia (410-540 J m(-2) s(-0.5) K-1), and high rock abundance (18-25%). At local scales the actual surface distribution of rocks might be heterogeneous, as on terrestrial catastrophic flood surfaces, where rocks tend to be concentrated on fluvially armored surfaces and/or bars. Albedo increases and thermal inertia decreases from the northeast to the southwest in the ellipse, owing to (interpreted) windblown dark sand from Acidalia Planitia. If Mars Pathfinder lands at the southwest end of the landing ellipse, the scene is likely to be the most similar to that of the Viking 1 lander; while a landing at the northeast end of the ellipse is most likely to provide a view that is different from the Viking sites because of low-albedo material. A landing at the center of the ellipse might put the spacecraft near one of two crater clusters that are interpreted to have dark sandy material in or on their ejecta. Aeolian activity during the 30-day Primary Mission might be limited because it is mid-northern summer, a time in which no historic dust storms have been seen in the region, and a season when regional winds should be weak relative to other times during the year.

Three of these impoundments are Lake Texoma, John H. Kerr Reservoir, and Santee Cooper Reservoir, whose natural recruitment is dependent on their tributary rivers. Historic management of these populations has required addressing issues of excess reproduction, excess harvest, and spawning flow alteration. Initial high abundance fostered a harvest oriented mind set among striped bass anglers in these reservoirs, which today can only be sustained on Lake Texoma. Supplemental stocking of both Kerr and Santee-Cooper reservoirs has been used to replace declines in natural recruitment. Mortality estimates suggest that reproductive overfishing may be the underlying cause of natural recruitment declines. Recent adjustments to harvest regulations at both Kerr and Santee-Cooper were required to increase the number of striped bass reaching reproductive age. Both management approaches reduce fishing mortality through reduced daily bag and higher size limits, but also recognize that high catch-and-release mortality makes length limits counterproductive during the summer.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-36-3				2013	80						413	430																WOS:000323292100025

The objectives of this study were to determine (1) the influence of stocking size on the relative survival of saugeyes, (2) changes in the black crappie population that were potentially associated with the saugeye introduction, and (3) the incidence of black crappies in the diet of saugeyes. Saugeyes were stocked at a total length of 3-4 cm in 1992 and 1993; survival was low. Larger, 14-25-cm saugeyes were stocked annually from 1994 to 1998, and survival was significantly greater. The larger fingerlings were able to survive and establish a population in the face of predation by and competition with black crappies. Black crappie growth rates increased significantly after the saugeye population was established. Before the saugeye introduction program, a 20-cm black crappie typically grew less than 25 mm over a year, but by 1999 this had increased to 70 mm. As a result, black crappie size structure increased significantly. Before the saugeye introduction, few black crappies exceeded 25 cm total length, whereas 25-cm and longer fish were common by 1998 and 1999. Saugeye food habits were monitored seasonally at Richmond Lake during 1998. Saugeyes in all length-groups consumed age-0 black crappies during all sampling periods except in early spring, when age-0 fishes were not yet available. Larger (>20 cm) black crappies were not observed in saugeye stomachs during our study. Thus, the saugeyes in Richmond Lake probably reduced the abundance and intraspecific competition of small black crappies, which resulted in increased growth and improved size structure for crappies.

Cation-exchange properties of pumice: Taking a sip from a volcanic cocktail	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY					7th International Conference on Methods and Applications of Radioanalytical Chemistry	APR 03-07, 2006	Kailua, HI					The search for the telltale signs of volcanic eruptions in easily dateable (biological) material like tree rings or spelcothems has been going on for a very long time. Even though the reactions of tree rings to cataclysmic events are fairly well understood, there has not been a satisfactory method to distinguish volcanic from other climatically active events. Recent findings of differing Ba-contents in soil and the unexpected mobility of Ba during volcanic eruptions strongly suggest that tephra changes the concentrations of trace elements in the surrounding topsoil. To better understand the mechanics of this enrichment, leaching experiments with volcanic ashes have been performed that show that pumice acts as a cation-exchanger. Neutron activation analysis (NAA) with its reasonably simple sample preparation and the possibility to distinguish volcanic ashes from contamination of solvents by using activated ashes offers a hands on approach to the problem above. Several samples of known composition of volcanic ashes have been activated and leached with different solvents and solutions, aiming to both recreate a realistic situation comparable to natural leaching due to rain fall and obtain quantifiable results.

Reservoir sedimentation:: 1D model of turbidity currents and delta deposits	RIVER FLOW 2006, VOLS 1 AND 2	Proceedings and Monographs in Engineering Water and Earth Sciences				International Conference on Fluvial Hydraulics	SEP 06-08, 2006	Lisbon, PORTUGAL					AID mathematical-numerical model simulating the flow and sediment deposition in a reservoir is presented. The flow is modeled using Saint-Venant equations discretized with a finite volume numerical scheme capable of dealing with transcritical flows. Evolution of coarse sediment deposits is accounted for by using a choice of four different available bedload relationships. Two of them are based on the surface grain-size distribution and include hiding effects. Modeling of fine sediment transport and deposition is accomplished by the simulation of a turbidity current, for which minor modifications to classical depth-averaged equations allow for a complete representation of the fine sediment fall velocity effect. The numerical scheme used for the flow is adapted and used for turbidity current modeling. The full model is tested in a real reservoir application. Results show that the model is able to reproduce the co-evolution of sediment deposits capturing all the unsteady effects, including the internal hydraulic jump development in the ponded turbidity current and its time evolution in response to variable boundary conditions.

These rivers flow through Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan. Because the upper reaches of the river are acidified by a caldera lake and basin, the river water contains aluminum in high concentration, together with iron and sulfate. The drainage area at the lower reaches is not acidified. Therefore, the acidified water of the river is neutralized by the alkalinity of water from the drainage area. The water at the mouth is neutral in pH, although about 1 mg/L of aluminum is detected. Heavy rainfall occurred in Autumn 1993, and many adult salmon were killed at the lower reaches of the river. This prompted study of the neutralization process of river water, the Al concentration change, and the influence of rainfall. Determination of Al found total Al concentration to be roughly constant at the mouth of the Noboribetsu River. However, the concentration of monomeric Al varied with pH, which varied according to rainfall and flow volume. Monomeric Al showed a minimum concentration of roughly pH 6.0. At pH of greater than 6.0, the presence of some kinds of polymeric Al is determined by filtration fraction. This suggests that the death of salmon is caused by monomeric Al when conditions are acidic. Liming test of the river water confirmed that the monomeric Al that was toxic under acidic conditions became non-toxic under alkaline conditions.																			0049-6979					AUG-SEP	2001	130	1-4	2				917	922		10.1023/A:1013863803262	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1013863803262													WOS:000172011900123
J	James, RT; Havens, K; Zhu, GW; Qin, BQ				James, R. Thomas; Havens, Karl; Zhu, Guangwei; Qin, Boqiang			Comparative analysis of nutrients, chlorophyll and transparency in two large shallow lakes (Lake Taihu, PR China and Lake Okeechobee, USA)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This article compares limnological attributes of two of the world's largest shallow lakes Lake Okeechobee in Florida, USA and Lake Taihu in P. R. China. Both the systems support an array of ecological and societal values including fish and wildlife habitat, public water supply, flood protection, and recreation. Both have extensive research programs, largely because of concern regarding the lakes' frequent cyanobacterial blooms. By evaluating these systems together, we compare and contrast properties that can generally advance the understanding and management of large shallow lowland lakes. Because of shallow depth, long fetch, and unconsolidated mud sediments, water chemistry, and transparency in both the lakes are strongly influenced by resuspended sediments that affect light and nutrient conditions. In the central region of both the lakes, where depth is the greatest, evaluation of limiting factors by a trophic state index approach indicates that light most often limits phytoplankton biomass. In contrast, the more sheltered shoreline areas of both the lakes display evidence of nitrogen (N) limitation, which also has been confirmed in nutrient assays conducted in earlier studies. This N limitation most likely is a result of excessive levels of phosphorus (P) that have developed in the lakes due to high external loads over recent decades and the currently high internal P recycling. Comparisons of these lakes show that Lake Taihu has higher N than, similar total phosphorus (TP) and similar light conditions to that of Lake Okeechobee, but less chlorophyll a (CHL). The latter may be as a result of lower winter temperatures in Lake Taihu (around 5 degrees C) compared to Lake Okeechobee (around 15 degrees C), which could reduce phytoplankton growth and abundance through the other seasons of the year. In these systems, the important role of light, temperature, and nutrients in algal bloom dynamics must be considered, especially due to possible adverse and unintended effects that might occur with projects such as sediment removal, and in the long term, in regard to buffering lake responses to external load reduction.

These metals are rapidly scavenged by the seston (suspended particulates) and have a rapid turnover rate in the water column. Factors that affect the distribution of dissolved trace metals include water depth, seston abundance, and biological processes. Higher concentrations are generally found in nearshore stations and especially near the urban centers and polluted river mouths. In summer, there is a marked depletion of Zn (and other bioactive metals) in the epilimnion of the offshore waters. The patchiness in the concentrations of the metals is attributed to spatial differences in the biological processes. With the exception of Cr, there is no systematic increase in concentration down the drainage basin from Lake Superior to Lake Ontario. Most of the Pb, Cd, and Zn loadings into the lakes are retained in the basin, but there is a significant export of dissolved Cu, Ni, and Cr via the St. Lawrence River.																			0013-936X					JAN	1996	30	1					178	187		10.1021/es950221i	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es950221i													WOS:A1996TN49700047
J	KRYLOV, PI				KRYLOV, PI			DENSITY-DEPENDENT PREDATION OF CHAOBORUS-FLAVICANS ON DAPHNIA-LONGISPINA IN A SMALL LAKE - THE EFFECT OF PREY SIZE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Functional response curves of fourth instar larvae of Chaoborus flavicans preying on two size classes of Daphnia longispina were examined throughout three summer seasons in a small forest lake. Data for each size class were fitted to Holling's disc equation. The parameters a' (attack rate) and T(h) (handling time) were calculated for each prey size from these curves. Attack rate was greater and handling time was shorter for small (0.77 mm) than for large (1.82 mm) Daphnia. In 1:1 mixture of these prey size classes the predation rates of Chaoborus on small Daphnia at prey densities above 20 l-1 were greater than predicted from the single size-class experiments. The observed predation rates on large Daphnia were lower than predicted at all prey densities. Since both single size-class and two size-class experiments were run during the same period of time the difference in observed and predicted predation rates could not be attributed to seasonal changes in prey preference of Chaoborus larvae. In experiments with a concentrated mixture of lake zooplankton (dominated by D. longispina) Chaoborus preference for Daphnia decreased as prey body size increased. There was no obvious correlation between selectivity coefficients and size-frequency distributions of Daphnia. When medium-sized Daphnia were omitted from calculations the preference of small over large prey did not differ significantly from the predictions of the single size-class model.																			0018-8158					SEP 18	1992	239	3					131	140		10.1007/BF00007670	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007670													WOS:A1992JN83900001

Migratory behavior was quantified repeatedly by 1300 and 21-2200 h sampling in the epilimnion. Population density and vertical distribution were estimated routinely at 1300 h and at 2200 h on selected dates. Males had greater night to day biomass differentials and ratios than females. The sexes showed comparable DVM participation (% of total biomass migrating) and amplitudes of migration (distance of ascent). Copepodids displayed higher participation, night/day ratios and amplitudes than younger copepods, but adult participation differed only from that of nauplii. Active participation in high amplitude ascents thus increased with age and was greatest in adult males. Such relative behaviors probably occur in most limnetic Diaptomus and the magnitude of ascent into the epilimnion may be associated with daytime vertical distribution.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1980	74	3					241	248		10.1007/BF00008757	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008757													WOS:A1980KM04900006

Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Open Surface Water in the Central Valley of California 2000-2011: Drought, Land Cover, and Waterbirds	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												We used Landsat satellite imagery to (1) quantify the distribution of open surface water across the Central Valley of California 2000-2011, (2) summarize spatio-temporal variation in open surface water during this time series, and (3) assess factors influencing open surface water, including drought and land cover type. We also applied the imagery to identify available habitat for waterbirds in agriculture. Our analyses indicated that between 2000 and 2011 open surface water has declined across the Central Valley during the months of July-October. On average, drought had a significant negative effect on open surface water in July, September, and October, though the magnitude and timing of the effect varied spatially. The negative impact of a drought year on open water was experienced immediately in the southern Central Valley; however, there was a oneyear time-lag effect in the northern Central Valley. The highest proportion of open surface water was on agricultural lands followed by lakes, rivers, and streams, yet the relative proportions varied spatially and across months. Our data were consistent with previous descriptions of waterbird habitat availability in post-harvest rice in the northern Central Valley. Tracking water distribution using satellites enables empirically based assessments of the impacts of changing water policy, land-use, drought, climate, and management on water resources.

Yet, long and high-resolution biogenic proxy records have not been available for the Indian summer monsoon (ISM), owing to the lack of well-dated and continuous sediment sequences. To investigate the ISM conditions since the middle and late Pleistocene, we here examined the oxygen and carbon isotopic compositions (delta O-18 and delta C-13) of the shells of two ostracod species (benthic Lineocypris jiangsuensis and nektobenthic Ilyocypris microspinata), carbonates smaller than < 63 <mu>m and bulk sediment from the upper part (ca. 274-64 ka) of a sediment core (HQ-2002) drilled from the central Heqing Basin located at the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. The concordant delta O-18 and delta C-13 variations among ostracod shells, < 63 <mu>m carbonates and bulk sediment indicate that they recorded the variations of the water compositions of the Heqing paleolake. Furthermore, the delta O-18 values are synchronized with those of stalagmites from Xiaobailong Cave in southwestern China and pace the ISM during the middle and late Pleistocene period, with both responding to precipitation. As a nektobenthic species, the delta O-18(ostr) values of I. microspinata shells are more sensitive to ISM precipitation than that of L. jiangsuensis shells. Meanwhile, the delta C-13(ostr) values of the I. microspinata shells are lower than those of the L. jiangsuensis shells, which were determined by the lake-water layers in which they lived, and their co-variations reveal lake productivity associated with ISM intensity. The delta O-18(ostr) and delta C-13(ostr) values for the shells of these two ostracod species indicate that the paleolake experienced a shallow-deep-shallow evolution of the lake-water level, pacing the ISM in the middle and late Pleistocene. The study highlights the sensitivity of the chemical compositions of ostracod shells to monsoon and lake productivity at glacial-interglacial cycles.

Melting snow provides water into dry summer months characteristic of the region's Mediterranean climate. As climate changes, understanding patterns of snowpack, snowmelt, and biological response is critical in this region of agricultural, recreational, and ecological value. Here we investigated the relationships between tree rings of montane conifer trees (Tsuga mertensiana, Abies magnifica, Abies concolor, Calocedrus decurrens, Juniperus occidentalis, and Pinus ponderosa) and regional climate indices with the goal of reconstructing April 1 snow-water equivalent (SWE) in the North Fork American River watershed of the Sierra Nevada. Chronologies were positively correlated with April 1 SWE of the year prior to ring formation. Temporal trends in correlation between tree-ring chronologies and climate indices indicate strengthening tree growth response to climate over time. We developed a skillful, nested reconstruction for April 1 SWE, 1661-2013. Variability of the reconstruction is within the envelope of 20th and 21st-century variability; however, the 2015 record low snowpack is unprecedented in the tree-ring record, as in results from previous studies. Future research should focus on integrating modern snow sensor data into paleoclimate research and understanding mechanistic linkages between snow and tree growth response.					; Lepley, Kai/HGB-9648-2022	Meko, David/0000-0002-5171-2724; Lepley, Kai/0000-0003-4737-1098; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				SEP	2020	30	9					1266	1278	0959683620919972	10.1177/0959683620919972	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683620919972		MAY 2020											WOS:000533971900001

The hidden hydrology of Groenvlei, a lacustrine wetland on the southern Cape coast of South Africa	WATER SA												Following Parsons' (2009) challenge of the hypothesis that Groenvlei is sustained by discharge from the underlying Table Mountain Group Aquifer, research was undertaken to better understand the hydrology of Groenvlei. Using a daily water balance model coupled to Darcian flow calculations it was possible to show that direct rainfall and evapotranspiration losses were the key hydrological drivers of the system, with groundwater playing an important but secondary role. It was found that Groenvlei is not endorheic and that S pan measurements are best upscaled to lake evaporation using coefficients offered by Midgley etal. (1994). The reed collar plays an important role in the functioning of the lake, but is dormant during winter. The outcome of the research demonstrated that sound conceptualisation using all available data, information and knowledge remains a critical aspect of any hydrological modelling. The improved understanding of the hydrology of Groenvlei is expected to facilitate a better understanding of the nine Ramsar wetlands located on similar, but more complicated, hydrogeological settings elsewhere on the South African coastline.																			0378-4738	1816-7950				JAN	2017	43	1					42	47		10.4314/wsa.v43i1.07	http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/wsa.v43i1.07													WOS:000396502100007

In this lake, C, acidophila uses NH4+ as the primary inorganic nitrogenous nutrient, since only trace amounts of other inorganic nitrogenous compounds are present. The delta(15)N values obtained for C. acidophila ranged from -7.8 to -3.4parts per thousand. during the study period. The lowest values occurred during periods characterized by high concentrations of NH4+ ( > 15 mumol l(-1)), and our results showed that delta(15)N values for C. acidophila were negatively correlated with concentrations of NH4+. The results suggest that this nutrient plays a major role in the variation of the delta(15)N value for this species.

The Benefits of Using a Network of Superconducting Gravimeters to Monitor and Study Active Volcanoes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												We present results from a mini-array of three iGrav superconducting gravimeters (SGs) at Mount Etna. This is the first network of SGs ever installed on an active volcano. Continuous gravity measurements at active volcanoes are mostly accomplished with spring gravimeters that can be operated even under harsh field conditions. Nevertheless, these instruments do not provide reliable continuous measurements over periods longer than a few days due to the instrumental drift and artifacts driven by ambient parameters. SGs are free from these instrumental effects and thus allow to track even small gravity changes (1-2Gal) over a wide range of time scales (minutes to months). However, SGs need host facilities with main electricity and a large installation surface, implying that they cannot be deployed in close proximity to the active structures of tall volcanoes. At Mount Etna the three iGrav SGs were installed at distances from the summit active craters ranging between 3.5 and 15km. Despite the relatively unfavorable position of the installation sites, we show that these instruments can detect meaningful (i.e., volcano-related) changes that would otherwise remain hidden, like, for example, the weak gravity signature (within a few Gal) of gas buildup at intermediate depth in the plumbing system of Etna, during noneruptive intervals. Our results prove that iGrav SGs are powerful tools to monitor and study active volcanoes and can provide unique information on the bulk processes driving volcanic activity.					; Carbone, Daniele/H-7649-2014; Cannavo', Flavio/H-4781-2019	Cannavo', Flavio/0000-0001-7550-8579; Greco, Filippo/0000-0002-0265-5073; Carbone, Daniele/0000-0003-2566-6290; 													2169-9313	2169-9356				APR	2019	124	4					4035	4050		10.1029/2018JB017204	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JB017204													WOS:000468912000044

Water bodies were grouped in four categories: humic lakes, clear oligotrophic lakes, beaver ponds and steppe shallow lakes, which differed in their nutrient and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) contents. We tested if microbial planktonic communities were different among lakes with dissimilar nutrient and DOC concentrations, analysing to what extent the known large-scale patterns of lake trophic structure applies to a diverse but localized set of lakes. We found that mixotrophs dominated over strict autotrophs in both humic and clear oligotrophic systems, whereas in eutrophic lakes autotrophy was a successful strategy. The functional phytoplankton approach also allowed the separation between oligotrophic (clear and humic) and eutrophic systems, with different functional groups. The lowest abundances of picoplankton were found in oligotrophic lakes, picoeukaryotes being more abundant than picocyanobacteria in beaver ponds and humic lakes. Our results show that in low nutrient environments, mixotrophic strategies thrive over strict autotrophs suggesting the paramount importance of the microbial loop when compared with high trophic status systems where the prevalence of autotrophy indicates that the energy flux depends on phytoplankton.					; Saad, Juan Francisco/KHY-4593-2024	Schiaffino, Maria Romina/0000-0002-9383-2003; O'Farrell, Ines/0000-0002-2236-2905; Saad, Juan Francisco/0000-0002-4482-8892													0142-7873	1464-3774				NOV-DEC	2013	35	6					1220	1233		10.1093/plankt/fbt075	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbt075													WOS:000326381800004

During the summer field seasons of the 63rd and 64th Russian Antarctic Expeditions (2017-2019), comprehensive hydrological, GPR and geodetic surveys were conducted in this area to ensure the safety of transport operations. The results of field measurements and calculations based on mathematical modeling of the breakthrough flood from the Lake are presented. The purpose of this study was to compare field observations and model calculations of the breakthrough flood and then to verify the existing model of Yu.B. Vinogradov on real data, since detailed observations of breakthrough floods of lakes of the Antarctic oases have not been previously carried out. The results of complex hydrological and geophysical investigations of LH73-Progress-Sibtorp lake system focused on areas where lake outburst are possible (snow-ice dams) made possible to formulate phenomenological model of the outburst process. It was emphasized that the lake water was discharged through a tunnel developed in the snow-ice dam, which subsequently evolved into a real riverbed. The maximum water discharge was formed approximately in 7.5 h after the start of the outflow, and it was estimated 5.4 m(3)s(-1) according to the in-situ measurements, and 4.94 m(3)s(-1) - by the model. The calculated volume of the flood is 76 320 m(3). The differences between the model and in-situ measurements are about 9% that can be explained by the fact that the time of water retention by the snow-ice dam is not considered in the model.					; Popov, Sergey/IYJ-2371-2023; Boronina, Alina/U-1830-2018; Cheterova, Antonina/N-1019-2013; Chetverova, Antonina/N-1019-2013	Grigoreva, Svetlana/0000-0002-8853-559X; Popov, Sergey/0000-0002-1830-8658; Prahina, Galina/0000-0003-3684-4638; Cheterova, Antonina/0000-0001-7461-3617; 													2076-6734	2412-3765					2020	60	4					613	622		10.31857/S2076673420040065	http://dx.doi.org/10.31857/S2076673420040065													WOS:000588489900012

During the fall all instars of M. edax were present in the water column. By early December, only CI-CIV instars were found.

No M. edax were found below 6 cm. By early March animals in the sediments emerged from dormancy and colonized the water column; CIV's and adult females predominated while CV's and adult males were present in small numbers. Dormancy of both juvenile and adult instars within one population is unusual among animal species. Life histories including multiple dormant stages may be more important for the adaptive evolution of cyclopoid copepods than calanoid copepods in freshwater habitats.																			0018-8158					JAN 31	1993	250	3					167	171		10.1007/BF00008587	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008587													WOS:A1993KP36300003

Here, we investigated anammox and denitrification potentials via the N-15 isotope pairing technique in the helium flushed bottom water (similar to 0.2 m above the sediment) of Sandusky Bay, Sandusky Subbasin, and Central Basin in Lake Erie in three consecutive summers (2010-2012). Potential rates of anammox (0-922 nM/day) and denitrification (1 to 355 nM/day) varied greatly among sampling sites during the 3 years we studied. The relative importance of anammox to total N-2 production potentially ranged from 0 to 100% and varied temporally and spatially. Our study represents one of the first efforts to measure potential activities of both anammox and denitrification in the water column of Lake Erie and our results indicate the Central Basin of Lake Erie is a hot spot for N removal through anammox and denitrification activities. Further, our data indicate that the water column, specifically hypolimnion, and the surface sediment of the Lake Erie Central Basin are comparatively important for microbially mediated N removal.

Lake-wide physical and biological trends associated with warming in Lake Baikal	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Eutrophication and warming of lakes are occurring globally. Lake Baikal, a large ancient lake composed of three basins, has recently experienced benthic eutrophication at local sites and lake warming in the south basin. Here, we look for signals of warming and pelagic eutrophication across the entire lake using physical and biological data collected at a subset of 79 stations sampled ca. annually (1977-2003) during the period of summer stratification. Lake-wide, surface waters warmed 2.0 degrees C; and, consistent with this warming, the abundance of two warm-water, cosmopolitan zooplankton taxa increased between two (pelagic cladocerans) and 12-fold (Cyclops kolensis). C kolensis increased throughout the lake, whereas cladocerans increased significantly only in the north basin. In contrast, abundance of the cold-water endemic copepod, Epischura baikalensis, that dominates the crustacean zooplankton community, did not change. With the exception of one coastal station in the north basin, there is no evidence of pelagic eutrophication. Although chlorophyll concentrations increased 46% lake-wide (0.82 to 1.20 mu g/L), the increasing trend was significant only in the south basin. Surprisingly, mean Secchi transparency increased by 1.4 m lake-wide across the 26-year time series with significant deepening of water transparency occurring in the central and north basins. This suggests a decline in productivity in the north and middle basins, but an increase in the south basin. Taken together, these findings suggest that physical and biological changes associated with warming have occurred in Lake Baikal, but wide-spread pelagic eutrophication in the lake's three basins has not.

The invasive cladoceran Cercopagis pengoi is a generalist predator capable of feeding on a variety of prey species of different sizes and escape abilities	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												We carried Out a comprehensive exploration of predation by the invasive predatory cladoceran Cercopagis pengoi in the laboratory. A range of potential prey was offered to the predator, including all major summer nearshore zooplankton taxa in Lake Michigan; we used prey in different concentrations from 5 to 100 ind. L(-1). We found that Cercopagis is a generalist capable to consume a variety of prey species, including small and large prey, and slowly and rapidly swimming prey. Consumption rates increased with concentration in several species, but did not saturate even at the highest concentration tested (40 or 100 ind. L(-1)). Cladocerans were consumed lit a higher rate than copepods. Cercopagis was able to catch and handle prey of nearly its own body size to prey about seventeen times smaller; however, it did not show any clear size preference within this range. In contrast to most indigenous Great Lakes zooplankton, Cercopagis can efficiently feed on veligers of the zebra Mussel, another invader from the Ponto-Caspian region.

Here we present a multiproxy analysis of a sedimentary sequence from Laguna Carmen (53 degrees S, 68 degrees W) which provides evidence of the progressive aridity and strengthening of the low-level Westerlies during the Late Holocene. We identified three prominent phases in the climatic record from Laguna Carmen: a cold and wet period between-4000 cal. BP and-2200 cal. BP, evidenced by a relative high lake level, periodic runoff into the lake, and oligohaline (mean: 2554 mu S/cm) salinities; a step-change towards warmer and drier conditions after-2200 cal. BP, reflected by limited runoff and oligo-mesohaline salinities (mean: 4799 mu S/cm); and finally, the establishment of modern semi-arid conditions some time after-1000 cal. BP, when the lake became a shallow lake that sometimes dried out during the summer. Our results coincide with paleoclimatic numerical models that suggest a progressive aridification of the southern Patagonian steppe since 6000 cal. BP due to stronger Westerlies and higher temperatures associated with changes in solar irradiance.

J	Kovác, M; Holcová, K; Nagymarosy, A				Kovác, M; Holcová, K; Nagymarosy, A			Paleogeography, paleobathymetry and relative sea-level changes in the Danube Basin and adjacent areas	GEOLOGICA CARPATHICA												The evolution of the Danube Basin is closely related to the extrusion of the Western Carpathian and Transdanubian Central Range lithospheric fragments from the East Alpine collision zone and to the Middle Miocene back-are extension, associated with the formation of the Pannonian Basin System. Deposits of the Eggenburgian marine transgression, reaching the Danube Basin broader area through the Alpine and Carpathian Foredeep, can be correlated with transgressive depositional system of the TB 2.1 cycle of Haq (1991). The transgressive sequence passes upwards into highstand, neritic to upper bathyal sedimentation. The Ottnangian marine and part of the anoxic and brackish sediments represent the falling stage deposition. The lowstand deposition which can be correlated with the TB 2.2 cycle of Haq (1991) appeared still in the Ottnangian, during the compressive tectonic event resulting in closure of smaller basins. Later, during the Karpatian, sedimentation of transgressive and highstand depositional systems took place, still on the present Danube Basin northern margin (Blatne Depression, Banovce Depression). The high energy environment of the basin attained deep neritic to upper bathyal depth. The angular discordance between the Karpatian and Badenian strata, very common absence of the Late Karpatian and Early Badenian deposits (proved by micropaleontological data), as well as the presence of sediments of this age in the Novohrad (Nograd) Basin and its equivalents in the Zeliezovce Depression (Danube Basin) suggest absence of the marine TB 2.3 cycle of Had (1991) in most of the territory. The whole area of the Danube Basin was flooded by the sea during the Middle to Late Badenian and Sarmatian. The sedimentation in the high energy environment of the neritic zone reflects two depositional cycles, which can be compared with the TB 2.4, TB 2.5 and TB 2.6 cycles of Haq (1991). The Badenian cycle started with the Middle Badenian rush transgression and highstand of the TB 2.4 cycle, followed by the Late Badenian higstand (SB type 2) and falling stage in the Bulimina-Bolivina Zone. The Sarmatian cycle started by a lowstand characterized by Ammonia rich assemblages on the Badenian-Sarmatian boundary and was followed by a transgression and highstand which can be correlated with the TB 2.6 cycle of Haq (1991). The Late Miocene shallow water high energy brackish to delta-lake sedimentation in the north and deep water high energy environment in the central and southern part represent equivalents of the TB 3 Haq (1991) cycles.

Ancient plant DNA reveals High Arctic greening during the Last Interglacial	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Summer warming is driving a greening trend across the Arctic, with the potential for large-scale amplification of climate change due to vegetation-related feedbacks [Pearson et al., Nat. Clim. Chang. (3), 673-677 (2013)]. Because observational records are sparse and temporally limited, past episodes of Arctic warming can help elucidate the magnitude of vegetation response to temperature change. The Last Interglacial ([LIG], 129,000 to 116,000 y ago) was the most recent episode of Arctic warming on par with predicted 21st century temperature change [Otto-Bliesner et al., Philos. Trans. A Math. Phys. Eng. Sci. (371), 20130097 (2013) and Post et al., Sci. Adv. (5), eaaw9883 (2019)]. However, high-latitude terrestrial records from this period are rare, so LIG vegetation distributions are incompletely known. Pollen-based vegetation reconstructions can be biased by long-distance pollen transport, further obscuring the paleoenvironmental record. Here, we present a LIG vegetation record based on ancient DNA in lake sediment and compare it with fossil pollen. Comprehensive plant community reconstructions through the last and current interglacial (the Holocene) on Baffin Island, Arctic Canada, reveal coherent climate-driven community shifts across both interglacials. Peak LIG warmth featured a similar to 400-km northward range shift of dwarf birch, a key woody shrub that is again expanding northward. Greening of the High Arctic-documented here by multiple proxies-likely represented a strong positive feedback on high-latitude LIG warming. Authenticated ancient DNA from this lake sediment also extends the useful preservation window for the technique and highlights the utility of combining traditional and molecular approaches for gleaning paleoenvironmental insights to better anticipate a warmer future.

J	Feng, ZX; Li, CY				Feng, Zhixuan; Li, Chunyan			Cold-front-induced flushing of the Louisiana Bays	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Water level variations were used to calculate cold-front-induced water exchange fluxes for three Louisiana bays. Twenty-nine cold fronts were identified from weather maps between September 2006 and April 2007. Cold front passages cause water to flush out of the bays, with large variability in volume fluxes. Due to the differences in water body area and basin geometry, the Atchafalaya/Vermilion Bays have exchange rates an order of magnitude higher than the Barataria Bay. We identified five largest flushing events which were all associated with migrating extra-tropical cyclones with frontal orientations perpendicular to the coastline, suggesting that wind direction is an important component in determining the flushing rate. Both alongshore and cross-shore winds play important roles in bay-shelf water exchange, and northwest winds appeared to be most effective in flushing the bays. Strong cold fronts may flush more than 40% of the bay waters out onto the continental shelf within a less than 40-hour period. An analytical model is applied for the cold front wind induced flushing process which reveals that the amplitudes of water level variations induced by alongshore and cross-shore winds have the same order of magnitude, indicating that they play almost equally important roles in driving the subtidal water level changes inside the bays.

Determination of Ice Thickness on Lakes and Canals Using Audio Sound	ACTA ACUSTICA UNITED WITH ACUSTICA												The objective of this study is to determine the thickness of ice on lakes and canals by analyzing the sound spectrum generated by dispersion of Lamb type waves propagating in ice. In winters when the lakes and canals freeze, it is important to know the thickness of the ice layer before setting foot on it. When a stone is thrown on the ice layer, a fluting sound can be heard. This is recorded for different thicknesses of ice and the sound spectrum is compared with the results simulated using a parameterized model created using plane wave theory for different thicknesses of ice. The frequencies of the reflected sound are then compared with the frequencies of musical instruments in order to assign different musical notes to different thicknesses of ice. It is found that the piano key E4 indicates the ice thickness safe for walking. Any higher key indicates an unsafe situation. The technique enables thickness estimation without the use of specialized equipment or time consuming drilling and may therefore be of practical value in the preservation of the lives of ice skaters and playing children.					; Declercq, Nico/R-4806-2019; Declercq, Nico/K-4526-2016	Shaw, Anurupa/0009-0002-7391-4957; Declercq, Nico/0000-0002-8721-8664													1610-1928	1861-9959				MAY-JUN	2015	101	3					484	493		10.3813/AAA.918845	http://dx.doi.org/10.3813/AAA.918845													WOS:000353869000007

Two-layer hydraulic exchange flow through the Burlington Ship Canal	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING												The exchange flow through the Burlington Ship Canal connecting Hamilton Harbour with Lake Ontario is investigated, using a two-layer internal hydraulics model. The summer exchange features an upper layer of polluted Harbour Water flowing from the harbour into the lake, whereas a lower layer of fresh Lake Ontario Water flowing from the lake into the harbour. We predict this exchange, taking into account the effects of both friction and barotropic forcing of multiple frequencies. Predictions of density interface and volume flux compare well with experimental and field data. The interface varies non-linearly with distance along the canal, with and without barotropic forcing. Our results indicate that the exchange flow is highly frictional. The barotropic forcing comprises oscillation modes of different frequency; these individual forcing modes cause the interface and layer velocities to fluctuate significantly in time, but their influence on the time average flows through the canal is minimal.

Their occurrence within the sedimentary sequences of lacustrine landforms can provide important evidence about palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic change. However, research using lake sediments in a geomorphological context to investigate climate change is limited. Here, we use newly discovered IWPs developed within lake sediment sequences to explore climate-related lake-level fluctuations in the Dali Lake region, a key area of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) system that drives Quaternary hydroclimate variability across East Asia. The IWPs penetrate down through clay-silt lake sediments and are overlain by coarser-fossiliferous, and finer-diatomaceous lake sediments. This configuration suggests IWP formation occurred within an area transitioning sequentially between subaqueous, subaerially exposed, and resubmerged lake margin setting. We employ the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and AMS radiocarbon dating methods to constrain ice-wedge activity timing. Results reveal ice wedge formation between 12.84 and 11.31 ka, corresponding to the globally significant Younger Dryas (YD) cold-climate event. The colder climate since 12.84 ka has led to a marked lake level decline, exposing shoreline areas, which subsequently became frozen, resulting in fissure development and ice infilling. Subsequently, the lake level increased, resulting in a minor highstand, with fossiliferous lake sediment accumulation over the ice wedges during 12.50 ka to 11.94 cal kyr BP. From 11.94 cal kyr BP to 11.31 ka, the lake level declined again, with concomitant ice wedge development. These three lake-level changes and their IWP characteristics reflect regional YD hydroclimatic variability. Wider research using high-resolution multi-proxy analysis of lake sediment cores suggests sustained cold-dry climate conditions during the YD. Our results, using the lake sediment-landform sequence, also suggests a cold climate (similar to 8.2 degrees C colder than today) but one that fluctuated between dry-humid-dry hydrological patterns during the YD. This study highlights the potential for using IWP affected lake sediment-landform sequences to improve understanding of landscape responses to YD climate variability in the EASM affected region.

To investigate the temporal and spatial distribution of total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) in LC and adjacent Cheonggye Bay (CB), water and sediment samples were collected five times from August 2009 to August 2010. In addition, fish samples were collected to examine Hg levels. The THg concentration in the unfiltered water of LC ranged from 1.6 to 5.0 ng/L and had a positive relationship with total suspended solids (TSS). This positive relation indicates that TSS is an important source of THg in LC. The MeHg levels were highest during August and ranged from 0.03 to 0.19 ng/L in unfiltered water and from 0.01 to 0.10 ng/L in filtered water. Both the THg and MeHg levels in the sediments were significantly correlated with the organic matter content of the sediments. Overlapping of the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of MeHg and %MeHg between the water column and sediments suggests that production and diffusion of MeHg from the sediment, particularly during warm summer, was the primary source of MeHg in the water column. In addition, higher THg and MeHg concentrations were found in catfish, a bottom-dweller fish. Thus, the higher THg and MeHg concentrations in LC compared to CB demonstrate that artificial lakes could be a significant site for Hg methylation and an additional source of MeHg to coastal seas.

Assessing the responses of aquatic macrophytes to the application of a lanthanum modified bentonite clay, at Loch Flemington, Scotland, UK	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Loch Flemington is a shallow lake of international conservation and scientific importance. In recent decades, its status has declined as a result of eutrophication and the establishment of non-native invasive aquatic macrophytes. As previous research had identified the lake bed sediments as an important source of phosphorus (P), the P-capping material Phoslock (R) was applied to improve water quality. This article documents the responses of the aquatic macrophyte community by comparing data collected between 1988 and 2011. Summer water-column total P concentrations decreased significantly and water clarity increased following treatment. Aquatic plant colonisation depth increased and plant coverage of the lake bed extended. However, the submerged vegetation remained dominated by the non-native Elodea canadensis Michx. Aquatic macrophyte community metrics indicated no significant change in trophic status. Species richness and the number of 'natural' eutrophic characteristic species remained broadly similar with no records of rare species of conservation interest. Loch Flemington is still classified as being in 'unfavourable no change' condition based on its aquatic macrophytes despite the water quality improvements. The implications of these results are discussed in relation to the future management of Loch Flemington and in the wider context of trying to improve our understanding of lake restoration processes.

J	Wiley, RW				Wiley, RW			Planting trout in wyoming high-elevation wilderness waters	FISHERIES												Trout planting in wilderness waters is being criticized as inappropriate. Most criticism focuses only on fish planting, ignoring other human activity in wilderness. People began to realize the consequences of past actions, like fish planting in wilderness waters, long after self-sustaining trout populations had established. As usual, some rushed to condemn the misguided actions of predecessors, deplore the results, and find ways to stop the intrusive fish planting, long after the sky had purportedly fallen. Wilderness management decisions, like those about fisheries management, are value judgments composed of trade-offs between opposing options. Options for the management of wilderness areas include (1) strict regulation of human activity to insure that the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man; (2) excluding fish planting because fish may significantly modify formerly fishless lake ecosystems but permitting other human pursuits such as hiking, camping, climbing, fire suppression, mining and livestock grazing; or (3) a judicious mix of all activities, including fishing and some fish planting. I prefer the last option because it allows a range of human activities, yet preserves wilderness attributes and addresses maintenance of biological diversity and ecosystem conservation.																			0363-2415					JAN	2003	28	1					22	27		10.1577/1548-8446(2003)28[22:PTIWHW]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8446(2003)28[22:PTIWHW]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000180394300008

Investigating fine particulate matter sources in Salt Lake City during persistent cold air pool events	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												During wintertime, Salt Lake City experiences periods of high-pressure atmospheric stagnation that leads to prolonged periods with stable atmospheric boundary layers (ABL) due to the unique orography of the region. These atmospheric conditions typically lead to persistent cold air pool (PCAP) events, where the stable ABL remains over several days, degrading air quality in the Salt Lake Valley. In this work, we applied novel source apportionment methods to identify sources that were the greatest contributors to elevated secondary PM2.5 concentrations during PCAP events in winter 2007. A source-oriented modeling approach that relies on emissions inventory data (i.e., source-specific data) was utilized for source characterization. A correction was applied to chemical transport model (CTM) outputs to improve the estimates of source contributions to secondary PM2.5 components (organic carbon, nitrate, sulfate, and ammonium). As a result, gasoline vehicles (25%), natural gas combustion (21%), and other sources (29%) were identified as the largest sources of nitrate, which was the dominant aerosol component during the PCAP periods ((NO3-](max) = 37.5 mu g m(-3)). Further, receptor-oriented source apportionment modeling was conducted using the chemical mass balance method with gas constraints (CMB-GC) with location-specific, mathematically optimized PM2.5 source profiles to examine the multi-year trend in PCAP pollution. These optimized profiles were enhanced by integrating the initial guess profiles with (FM results and observations. CMB-GC was applied for the period 2007-2015 at an urban monitor, and the use of seasonally varying optimized source profiles improved results by resolving more mass than when using static source profiles, increasing the predicted-observed PM2.5 mass ratio from 0.91 to 1.03. The averaged biomass burning impacts exhibited the most significant change, increasing from an average of 0.85 to 1.87 mu g m(-3) when using the static profiles and the optimized profiles, respectively. The static and optimized CMB-GC results were similar for secondary components but differed slightly for mobile impacts. Stratification of PCAP vs. non-PCAP CMB-GC source impacts revealed that the dominant sources of PM2.5 varied under the two meteorological conditions.

Syme] sampled from Nov. 1989 through Mar. 1990. Scanning electron microscopy was also used to determine the relationship between floral morphology and the freezing characteristics of the buds. Floral buds had multiple abrupt low-temperature exotherms (LTEs) and one or two broad LTEs in DTA tests. Abrupt LTEs from DTA were associated with apparent injury to the inflorescence in viability tests. The number of LTEs did not correspond to the number of racemes or flowers per bud, indicating that several flowers froze simultaneously. DTA experiments conducted in Dec. 1990 revealed that the broad exotherm detected between -14 and -20C in 'Danka' samples resulted from freezing of supercooled water in the outer nonliving region of the periderm of cane tissue attached to the bud.																			0003-1062					NOV	1991	116	6					1030	1034		10.21273/JASHS.116.6.1030	http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/JASHS.116.6.1030													WOS:A1991GQ44700022
J	Yang, YP; Ran, M; Sun, AZ				Yang, Yunpeng; Ran, Min; Sun, Aizhi			Pollen-recorded bioclimatic variations of the last ∼2000 years retrieved from Bayan Nuur in the western Mongolian Plateau	BOREAS												The palaeoclimatic variations during the past 2000 years in western Mongolia were reconstructed using a high-resolution pollen sequence obtained from Bayan Nuur. The pollen-based mean annual precipitation (MAP) from Bayan Nuur and the tree ring-based temperature anomalies from the nearby Altai Mountains exhibit a 'warm-dry' Roman Warm Period (RWP; 1900 to 1500 cal. a BP), a 'cool-wet' Dark Age Cold Period (DACP; 1500 to 1150 cal. a BP), a 'warm-dry' Medieval Warm Period (MWP; 1150 to 800 cal. a BP) and a 'cool-wet' Little Ice Age (LIA; 800 to 100 cal. a BP). Nevertheless, the Current Warm Period (CWP; since 100 cal. a BP) is an exception that fits a 'warm-wet' mode. A more detailed comparison between the pollen-based MAP curve and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index curve suggests that the higher-precipitation episodes generally corresponded with more negative NAO episodes. The chronological correspondence between the higher-precipitation episodes and the more negative NAO episodes means that more Atlantic storm tracks originated from the southern part of the North Atlantic Ocean and also from the Mediterranean Sea during negative NAO episodes. It implies that the precipitation variations during the past two millennia have been modulated primarily by NAO variations and negatively phased NAO settings contributed to more winter precipitation in Bayan Nuur basin.

All these fall under the category of optically complex waters (case 2), where water-leaving radiance is affected by optically active water constituents and bottom substrate. The present study estimates water quality parameters, viz. turbidity, suspended sediment concentration and chlorophyll in River Ganga in Buxar (Bihar), and Howrah (West Bengal) and Chilika lagoon (Odisha) using hyperspectral reflectance data of AVIRIS-NG. Concurrent ground-truth data of water samples were collected and simultaneous spectro-radiometer measurements were made in synchronous with the AVIRIS-NG flight over the study area. Semi-analytical simulation modelling followed by inversion and contextual image analysis-based methods were used for estimating the water quality parameters. Water turbidity maps were generated for both the study sites. Over Ganga river, water was relatively clear in Buxar (6.87-20 NTU, TSS 42-154 mg/l), while it was extremely turbid in Howrah (50-175 NTU, TSS 75-450 mg/l). In Chilika lagoon, water was more turbid in the northern sector, which may be due to the river input and resuspension from shallow bathymetry. The results suggest that the small-scale changes in turbidity due to point sources like river tributaries or sewerage discharges can be identified using hyperspectral data. The imaging spectroscopy data over water are a key source to find out potential locations of water contamination.					; Garg, Vaibhav/J-8066-2012; K, Abdul Hakeem/ABE-9036-2020	Dhote, Pankaj R./0000-0002-3483-0059; Gujrati, Ashwin/0000-0002-7810-741X; K, Abdul Hakeem/0000-0003-2330-1386													0011-3891					APR 10	2019	116	7					1172	1181		10.18520/cs/v116/i7/1172-1181	http://dx.doi.org/10.18520/cs/v116/i7/1172-1181													WOS:000463900200028
J	Gürlük, S; Rehber, E				Gürlük, S; Rehber, E			Evaluation of an integrated wetland management plan:: Case of Uluabat (Apollonia) Lake, Turkey	WETLANDS												Wetlands have global, regional, and local values in terms of hydrologic, biogeochemical, and ecological criteria. Especially in developing countries such as Turkey, a continued unsustainable development process, which degrades nature, has also been threatening wetlands. The main problem is the relationship between the stakeholders and local economic interests, which is often conflicting. International agreements such as the Ramsar Convention are key actions for solving these problems in terms of wise-use principles. In this study, Uluabat Integrated Wetland Management Plan, which was prepared under Ramsar principles, has been evaluated as a case study. Uluabat is one of the most important wetlands, not only because of its regional and local usage, but also its global merits such as serving as a wintering and feeding area for some endangered species. The investigated plan is important for Turkey as a pioneer study. It can be seen as a framework rather than a comprehensive plan. It needs not only some revision in its content but also some additional activities, such as monitoring and evaluation. Integrating it with a regional rural development project is needed in order to achieve proposed objectives.																			0277-5212					MAR	2006	26	1					258	264		10.1672/0277-5212(2006)26[258:EOAIWM]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/0277-5212(2006)26[258:EOAIWM]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000236603100022
J	Narita, T				Narita, T			Cocoon deposition of Rhyacodrilus hiemalis Ohtaka (Tubificidae) in Lake Biwa, Japan	HYDROBIOLOGIA					8th International Symposium on Aquatic Oligochaeta	JUL 18-22, 2000	BILBAO, SPAIN	Univ Basque Country, Dept Anim Biol & Genet				The breeding ecology of the tubificid worm Rhyacodrilus hiemalis was studied in Lake Biwa with special reference to timing and duration of cocoon deposition. number of eggs in a cocoon, and the substrate type and the position used for cocoon attachment. Cocoon deposition lasted from the beginning of January to the end of March. and peaked between mid-January and mid-February. Laboratory experiments showed that most R. hiemalis breed only once during their lifetime. In its natural habitat. most cocoons contained from 5 to 15 eggs (mean = 10.82, SD = 3.55, range = 0-33, n = 378), and the mean number of eggs per cocoon decreased as the deposition season progressed. The average number of eggs per cocoon of R. hiemalis is the greatest known among the tubificids. In Lake Biwa, R. hiemalis positioned its cocoons beneath the sediment. attached to the shell surface of bivalves and gastropods and to rock substrates, laboratory experiments showed that most cocoons were located less than 2 cm beneath the sediment surface. Under laboratory conditions, R. hiemalis produces a single cocoon during its lifetime. with a large number of eggs in midwinter, a period when potential predation on the eggs is supposed to be at its lowest during the year, in Lake Biwa. The site of cocoon attachment near the sediment surface guarantees a supply of well-oxygenated water. This may enhance embryonic development and shorten the embryonic stages, thereby achieving rapid preparing growth prior to summer aestivation and minimizing predation risk during the vulnerable early instar stages.																			0018-8158					NOV 1	2001	463						141	148		10.1023/A:1013151624179	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1013151624179													WOS:000173381100019

The view angle should be taken into account when retrieving land surface temperature (LST) from IRS4 data. This study aims at improving the mono-window algorithm for retrieving LST from 1RS4 data. Based on atmospheric radiative transfer simulations, a model for correcting the VZA effects on atmospheric transmittance is proposed. In addition, a generalized model for calculating the effective mean atmospheric temperature is developed. Validation with the simulated dataset based on standard atmospheric profiles reveals that the improved mono-window algorithm for IRS4 obtains high accuracy for LST retrieval, with the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) being 1.0 K and 1.1 K, respectively. Numerical experiment with the radiosonde profile acquired in Beijing in winter demonstrates that the improved mono-window algorithm exhibits excellent ability for LST retrieval, with MAE and RMSE being 0.6 K and 0.6 K, respectively. Further application in Qinghai Lake and comparison with the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST product suggest that the improved mono-window algorithm is applicable and feasible in actual conditions.

J	EINARSSON, A				EINARSSON, A			SETTLEMENT INTO BREEDING HABITATS BY BARROW GOLDENEYES BUCEPHALA-ISLANDICA - EVIDENCE FOR TEMPORARY OVERSATURATION OF PREFERRED HABITAT	ORNIS SCANDINAVICA												The paper describes spatio-temporal patterns of settlement into different habitats by territorial pairs of Barrow''s Goldeneye at Lake Myvatn and River Laxa, Iceland, in spring. Locally, a preference for a habitat, as relfected by timing and rate of settlement and final density of pairs, could be predicted by density of potential food. Settlement followed a pattern which suggested preferred habitats were saturated. In rich habitats numbers of territorial pairs increased to a peak but decreased again before egglaying commenced. This decline could not be accounted for by a decline in food supply or redistribution of pairs due to ice break-up. This suggests that the decline represents a final adjustment of density after the habitat has become temporarily overcrowded. Territories were classified as either inshore or offshore, the latter being more costly to defend, smaller, set up later and eventually abandoned. Density of potential food was similar in both types of territory but inshore birds spent a lower proportion of time foraging.																			0030-5693					MAR	1990	21	1					7	16		10.2307/3676373	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3676373													WOS:A1990DD24600002

Approximately 47% of the 544 infested hectares were harvested during the summer of 1990. We measured effects of one series of harvests in five separate locations in Lake Minnetonka. Plant relative growth rates were greater (p = 0.001) in 54 m(2) harvested plots than in adjacent reference plots. The increased growth rate did not result in harvested areas having greater canopy density or higher total shoot biomass than adjacent reference areas. Harvesting reduced total shoot biomass and plant abundance at the water surface for up to 6 weeks following harvest. Eurasian watermilfoil was the dominant plant in all areas, although its presence in an area was not correlated with high total shoot biomass in that area. Total shoot biomass was positively correlated with both water clarity and percentage of sediment organic matter and negatively correlated with the percentage of clay in the sediments.																			0146-6623					JUL	1994	32						56	60																WOS:A1994QD84700002

Reliance on lakes by salmon, trout and charr (Oncorhynchus, Salmo and Salvelinus): An evaluation of spawning habitats, rearing strategies and trophic polymorphisms	FISH AND FISHERIES												Salmonid fishes may reside within or migrate between stream and lake habitats, or undergo anadromous migrations between freshwater and the ocean. While the degree of anadromy of salmonids has been thoroughly compared, no analogous review has examined the degree of lake use. To assess the extent of reliance on lake habitat in this family, we considered 16 species of salmon, trout and charr from the genera Oncorhynchus, Salmo and Salvelinus, comparing their (a) use of lakes as spawning habitat, (b) rearing strategies in lakes, and (c) occurrence and diversity of lacustrine trophic polymorphism. In identifying the primary life-history patterns of each species and exploring the lesser-known lacustrine behaviours, we found that the extent of reliance on lakes exhibits a negative association with the degree of anadromy. Oncorhynchus rely least on lakes, Salmo to an intermediate level and Salvelinus the most, opposite of the general prevalence of anadromy among these genera. Lakes are critical to adfluvial and lake-resident salmonids, but they also support anadromous and fluvial life histories by providing spawning, rearing, overwintering and/or summer refuge habitat. Adfluviality, although a non-anadromous life history, consists of similar migration-related traits and behaviours as anadromy, including the parr-smolt transformation, sex-biased patterns of migration and residency, and the presence of precocious males. Lakes support life-history variants, reproductive ecotypes and trophic morphs unique to lacustrine habitat. Therefore, conservation of salmonids is dependent on maintaining the diversity and quality of their habitats, including lakes.

Yellowstone Lake Nanoarchaeota	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Considerable Nanoarchaeota novelty and diversity were encountered in Yellowstone Lake, Yellowstone National Park (YNP), where sampling targeted lake floor hydrothermal vent fluids, streamers and sediments associated with these vents, and in planktonic photic zones in three different regions of the lake. Significant homonucleotide repeats (HR) were observed in pyrosequence reads and in near full-length Sanger sequences, averaging 112 HR per 1349 bp clone and could confound diversity estimates derived from pyrosequencing, resulting in false nucleotide insertions or deletions (indels). However, Sanger sequencing of two different sets of PCR clones (110 bp, 1349 bp) demonstrated that at least some of these indels are real. The majority of the Nanoarchaeota PCR amplicons were vent associated; however, curiously, one relatively small Nanoarchaeota OTU (71 pyrosequencing reads) was only found in photic zone water samples obtained from a region of the lake furthest removed from the hydrothermal regions of the lake. Extensive pyrosequencing failed to demonstrate the presence of an lgnicoccus lineage in this lake, suggesting the Nanoarchaeota in this environment are associated with novel Archaea hosts. Defined phylogroups based on near full-length PCR clones document the significant Nanoarchaeota 16S rRNA gene diversity in this lake and firmly establish a terrestrial clade distinct from the marine Nanoarcheota as well as from other geographical locations.

Tale of Two Storms: Impact of Extreme Rain Events on the Biogeochemistry of Lake Superior	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Climate change is expected to profoundly affect the Great Lakes region of North America. An increase in intensity and frequency of rain events is anticipated to deliver more runoff and to increase riverine inputs to Lake Superior's ecosystem. The effects of these changes on key biogeochemical parameters were analyzed by coupling satellite data, water column sensor profiles, and discrete surface-water sampling after two 500-year flood events in the Lake Superior basin. This study provides both a spatial and a temporal sense of how plumes interacted within the ecosystem. We also determined the significant differences in water quality parameters for plume versus nonplume waters. These two plumes were important for delivery of nutrients, with variable transport of sediments and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Data from the 2012 storm event showed a significant input of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and CDOM to the system. In the 2016 storm event, carbon cycling parameters (acidity, total inorganic carbon, and dissolved organic carbon) and ammonia levels were elevated within the plume. In neither storm event was there a significant difference in chlorophyll a between plume and nonplume waters during our sampling cruises. These two plume events were similar in amount of precipitation, but their effect on the biogeochemistry of Lake Superior varied due to differences in the watersheds where the rain fell. The studied plume events were dynamic, changing with currents, winds, and the settling of suspended sediments.

We analyze 26 years of data on fish populations in the Hudson River to quantify changes associated with the zebra mussel invasion. Based on our measurements of changes in the lower food web, we predicted that populations of open-water fish species (e.g., Alosa spp.) would suffer and populations of littoral fish species (e.g., Centrarchidae) would prosper from the zebra mussel invasion. We found that the median decrease in abundance of open-water species was 28%, whereas the median increase in abundance of littoral species was 97%. Populations of open-water species shifted downriver away from the zebra mussel population, whereas those of littoral species shifted upriver. Median apparent growth rates fell by 17% among open-water species and rose by 12% in the single littoral species studied. Many of the observed changes were large and involved species of commercial or recreational importance (e.g., American shad (Alosa sapidissima), black basses (Micropterus spp.)). The influence of zebra mussels on fish should vary widely across ecosystems as a function of system morphology, factors that limit primary production, and diets of the fish species.

We established a permanent cell line from the heart of M. salmoides (MSH) that has been subcultured over 70 times and showed optimal growth at 27 degrees C using Medium 199 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. MSH cells consisted predominantly of fibroblast-like cells and their karyotypes revealed diploid numbers for most cells at passage 60 with 2n = 64. Sequencing of cytochrome oxidase I and 16S rRNA genes confirmed that MSH cells were derived from M. salmoides. The cell line was tested for Mycoplasma contamination and found to be negative. MSH cells were successfully transfected with a GFP reporter gene indicating that these cells can be utilized for gene expression studies. The MSH cells showed susceptibility to M. salmoides rhabdovirus (MSRV), Largemouth bass ranavirus (LMBV), Infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus(ISKNV), Spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV), Tilapia lake virus (TiLV) and Grass carp reovirus genotype I (GCRV-I) but were resistant to nervous necrosis virus (NNV). PCR assay and electron microscopy further confirmed that all the tested viruses except NNV can replicate in MSH cells. The replication efficiency of MSRV, LMBV, ISKNV, SVCV, TiLV and GCRV-I ranged from 10(7.24) to 10(8.82) TCID50/mL. In addition, type I interferon genes were induced with only NNV infection. In conclusion, we successfully generated an immortal cell line from the heart tissue of M. salmoides and the newly established MHS cell line was highly susceptible to many fish viruses that can be useful for future genetic, virological and immunological studies.

J	Chapelle, A; Lazure, P; Souchu, P				Chapelle, A; Lazure, P; Souchu, P			Modelling anoxia in the Thau lagoon (France).	OCEANOLOGICA ACTA												In summer, the Thau lagoon is often affected by anoxic outbreaks, which induce shellfish mortality. A 3D hydrodynamic model has been set up to simulate currents driven by the wind and the sea temperature. It has been coupled to a biochemical model including oxygen, organic matter and sulphides to reproduce the 'malaigue' event. Firstly the model has been applied to the 1997 anoxic crisis that broke out in the Meze area. It raises the importance of wind data and the impact of shellfish fanning structures that lower velocity currents. The model has also been applied to the 1982 and 1987 anoxic events, using historical data. The results point out that the 'malaigue' depends on the localization of the original flare up spots and the trophic status of the lagoon. Secondly, the model has been used to assess different modifications on locations of shellfish fanning areas in order to find the best way of reducing the anoxic crisis. The oxygen level could be improved by extending the distance between the shellfish areas and the coast or by reducing shellfish density.

A lack of observations beyond the last few decades inhibits a better mechanistic understanding of this process and thus a reliable prediction of future changes. Here we present past lake-water organic carbon trends inferred from sediment records across central Sweden that allow us to assess the observed increase on a centennial to millennial time scale. Our data show the recent increase in lake-water carbon but also that this increase was preceded by a landscape-wide, long-term decrease beginning already A. D. 1450-1600. Geochemical and biological proxies reveal that these dynamics coincided with an intensification of human catchment disturbance that decreased over the past century. Catchment disturbance was driven by the expansion and later cessation of widespread summer forest grazing and farming across central Scandinavia. Our findings demonstrate that early land use strongly affected past organic carbon dynamics and suggest that the influence of historical landscape utilization on contemporary changes in lake-water carbon levels has thus far been underestimated. We propose that past changes in land use are also a strong contributing factor in ongoing organic carbon trends in other regions that underwent similar comprehensive changes due to early cultivation and grazing over centuries to millennia.

A multi-proxy analysis of the Holocene humid phase from the United Arab Emirates and its implications for southeast Arabia's Neolithic populations	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												An early-to mid-Holocene humid phase has been identified in various Arabian geo-archives, although significant regional heterogeneity has been reported in the onset, duration and stability of this period. A multi-proxy lake and dune record from Wahalah in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) documents significant variations in hydrology, biological productivity and landscape stability during the first half of the Holocene. These data reveal that post-Last Glacial Maximum dune emplacement continued into the earliest part of the Holocene, with the onset of permanent lacustrine sedimentation at the site commencing similar to 8.5 ka cal. BP. A long-term shift towards more arid conditions is inferred between similar to 7.8 and 5.9 ka cal. BP, with intermittent flooding of the basin and distinct phases of instability throughout the catchment area. This transition is linked to the southwards migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and associated weakening of monsoon rains. A peak in landscape instability is recorded between similar to 5.9 and 5.3 ka cal. BP and is marked by a pronounced increase in regional dune emplacement. These variations are considered alongside the record of human settlement raising important questions about the interactions between population demographics, climate and environment in southeast Arabia during the Neolithic.

Quantifying water volumes of small lakes in the inner Aral Sea Basin, Central Asia, and their potential for reaching water and food security	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												In the inner Aral Sea Basin of Central Asia, numerous small lakes scattered over the irrigated landscape supply diverse ecosystem services for humans and nature. This study aimed to estimate the water volumes and assess the potentials of these small lakes for instance as irrigation reserve during the ever-recurring periods of water scarcity in the ecologically endangered Amudarya Delta. Bathymetric measurements gathered in the Khorezm region, Northwest Uzbekistan, permitted developing a statistical relationship between the surface and volume of the lakes. Landsat satellite data enabled for classifying the water bodies and hence deriving lake volumes over the study area. In 2002, the lakes stored similar to 0.032 km(3) water during the winter season, but similar to 0.057 km(3) during the main, 5-6 months spanning irrigation period. The area-wide increase in lake volumes during the irrigation period underlined the magnitude to which the currently practiced, inefficient use of irrigation water, produces excess water that in turn contributes to the existence of the small, mesotrophic lakes. Based on crop water requirements, calculations showed that the reuse of lake water may compensate for water-scarce situations, albeit to a certain extend only. An increased share (13 % above average) of water-intensive rice fields in the vicinity of the lakes substantiated that some lakes are already used in this way. It is argued that, in case of sufficient water quality, as indicated by other studies, more targeted exploration of such lake water can help simultaneously both, increasing food and water security of the households surrounding the lakes and safeguarding a supply to maintain different ecosystem functions. Integrated management of all water resources may reduce excess irrigation water supply to the region, which in turn may lessen the dependency of Central Asian downstream countries on transboundary water and supply water resources for the ecosystems in the river deltas.

J	CRESSA, C; LEWIS, WM				CRESSA, C; LEWIS, WM			ECOLOGICAL ENERGETICS OF CHAOBORUS IN A TROPICAL LAKE	OECOLOGIA												Ecological energetics of Chaoborus brasiliensis from Lake Valencia, Venezuela, were studied between February 1979 and February 1980. Direct measurements were made of the respiration rate, assimilation efficiency, and growth rate of all 4 larval instars and of the pupae. For the larval stages, respiration increased as the 0.67 power of body mass. Respiration rates of the larvae, when corrected for body size and temperature, were extraordinarily low by comparison with the rates for most aquatic insects. The respiration rates of pupae were 3 times as high as those of larvae the same size. Assimilation rates increased significantly with body size for the larvae and differed slightly but significantly among food types. Assimilation efficiencies fell within the expected range for carnivores. The growth efficiencies were exceptionally high for instars II-IV by comparison with other small aquatic organisms. High growth efficiency for Chaoborus brasiliensis, and possibly for Chaoborus generally, is explained by a very low maintenance cost and may be a significant explanation for the wide distribution and high degree of ecological success in this primary carnivore of plankton communities.

J	Lima, BEM; De Ros, LF				Moreira Lima, Bruno Eustaquio; De Ros, Luiz Fernando			Deposition, diagenetic and hydrothermal processes in the Aptian Pre-Salt lacustrine carbonate reservoirs of the northern Campos Basin, offshore Brazil	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The discovery of large oil accumulations in the rift and sag Pre-Salt sections of the Campos and Santos Basins has revived interest in the exploration of the lacustrine carbonate reservoirs in the Brazilian and African marginal basins. More than half of Brazilian oil production originates from the Pre-Salt reservoirs of these offshore basins. A study integrating systematic petrography, cathodoluminescence, scanning electron microscopy, microprobe and X-ray diffraction was performed on seven wells in the northern Campos Basin. This study highlights the major primary, diagenetic and hydrothermal features of the Pre-Salt succession, with the aim to improve our understanding of the factors that influence the porosity and permeability distribution in these important lacustrine carbonate reservoirs. The Pre-Salt deposits correspond to bioclastic grainstones and rudstones, syngenetic crusts of fascicular calcite, and intraclastic grainstones and rudstones of reworked crust fragments and calcite spherulites. Magnesian silicates are frequently associated with carbonate deposits. In the sag phase, stevensitic laminations constitute the substrate for the precipitation of calcite crusts and spherulites, which displace and replace the syngenetic magnesian clay deposits. In the rift section, stevensitic ooids are mixed with bioclasts or form ooidal arenites. Pre-Salt carbonate reservoirs have undergone a complex and heterogeneous diagenetic evolution. Eodiagenetic processes include the dissolution, neomorphism and cementation of bivalve bioclasts in the rift, as well as the dissolution of magnesian silicates and their replacement by calcite spherulites, silica and dolomite in the sag section. Burial alterations are commonly associated with hydrothermal fluids carried through faults and fracture systems. These fluids promote dolomitization, silicification, and dissolution at varying degrees and intensities. Eodiagenetic precipitation and dissolution owing to variations in the lake water chemistry and the episodic flow of hydrothermal fluids under burial conditions control the creation, redistribution, and obliteration of porosity in the Pre-Salt reservoirs.

These morphologies are from an evaporitic basin (the Makgadikgadi Basin) that is the remnant of an ancient Pleistocene lake and is currently part of the world's largest evaporitic system. The mounds in the Ntwetwe Pan are characterized by a layered structure and low relief (max. 5 m above the pan floor) and can be in excess of 2 km wide. The mounds consist mainly of loose (non-lithified) sand and silt with high moisture contents, even during the dry season. Geophysical investigations have shown that groundwater processes, particularly those related to the capillary fringe that rises and conveys moisture through the mounds, are factors that make mound sediments resistant to wind erosion. The inverted channels, identified in the southern part of the Ntwetwe Pan, are characterized by gentle reliefs and depressions, which depend upon the distribution of calcretes and indurated sediments. Large scale (up to 100 m wide) polygonal fractures localized at the front of the channels, disappear at the transition with the present-day pan floor. We consider that these particular mounds, within the Ntwetwe Pan, are remnants of the strandline of the paleo-Makgadikgadi Lake, and that the inverted channels represent distributary channels of a relict fan delta, formed by an ephemeral river, most likely the paleo-Boteti River, during a Lake Paleo-Makgadikgadi highstand stage. We consider that large scale (up to 100 m wide) polygonal fractures, located on the channel-mouth lobes, represent large-scale desiccation cracks formed by rapid water evaporation from delta deposits. The results of this investigation highlight the importance of the paleo-drainage system and its interactions with the water table and wind-deflation as main geomorphological factors within salt pan environments. The mounds in the Makgadikgadi pans also show strong geomorphic similarities to spring mounds on the surface of Mars, localized in equatorial layered deposits (ELDs). These ELDs mounds are considered to result from cyclical groundwater upwelling, evaporation and wind deflation. The geological processes that resulted in the formation of mounds within the Makgadikgadi pans may, therefore, help to explain how similar layered deposits formed on Mars and confirm existing theories.

Influence of reservoir water level fluctuations on sediment methylmercury concentrations downstream of the historical Black Butte mercury mine, OR	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Mercury (Hg) is a pollutant of global concern due to its ability to accumulate as methylmercury (MeHg) in biota. Mercury is methylated by anaerobic microorganisms such as sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) in water and sediment. Throughout North America, reservoirs tend to have elevated methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations compared to natural lakes and rivers. This impact is most pronounced in newly created reservoirs where methylation is fueled by the decomposition of flooded organic material, which can release Hg and enhance microbial activity. Much less is known about the longer-term water-level management impacts on Hg cycling in older reservoirs. The objective of our study was to understand the role of on-going water-level fluctuations on sediment MeHg concentrations and sulfur speciation within a reservoir 75 years after initial impoundment. The study was performed at the Cottage Grove Reservoir located 15 km downstream of the historical Black Butte Hg mine. For 8 months each year, the water level is lowered resulting in roughly half of the reservoir's sediment being exposed to the atmosphere. Water samples from the inflow, water-column, outflow, and sediment were collected seasonally over a year for total-Hg, MeHg, and several ancillary parameters. The results showed that conditions in the reservoir were favorable to methylation with a much higher % MeHg observed in the outflowing water (34%) compared to the inflow (7%) during the late-summer. An anoxic hypolimnion did not develop in the reservoir indicating that methylation was predominantly occurring in the sediments. In the sediments subjected to seasonal inundation, MeHg production was highest in the top 2 cm of the sediments and declined with depth. The seasonally inundated sediments also had significantly higher methylation activity than the permanently inundated area of the reservoir. Oxidizing conditions in the sediments during periods of exposure to air resulted in an increase in sulfate concentrations which likely stimulated SRB methylation following the raising of the water levels. In contrast, the sulfur in the permanently inundated sediments was all in a reduced form (sulfide) and sulfate remained below detection throughout the year. Overall, our results indicate that reservoir water level fluctuations can affect sediment redox conditions and enhance MeHg production. This process can result in a continued elevation of MeHg concentrations in older reservoirs after the initial impact of landscape flooding has subsided.

In Situ Production of Methylmercury within a Stream Channel in Northern California	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Natural stream ecosystems throughout the world are contaminated by methylmercury, a highly toxic compound that bioaccumulates and biomagnifies in aquatic food webs. Wetlands are widely recognized as hotspots for the production of methylmercury and are often assumed to be the main sources of this neurotoxin in downstream ecosystems. However, many streams lacking wetlands in their drainage basins (e.g., montane and semiarid regions in the western United States) have significant methylmercury contamination, and the sources of methylmercury in these streams remain largely unknown. In this study, we observed substantial production of methylmercury within a highly productive stream channel in northern California (South Fork Eel River) within a drainage basin lacking wetlands. We found that in situ methylmercury production is positively related to phosphorus removal and water temperature within the stream channel, supporting hypothesized biological mediation of in situ mercury transformation. Moreover, our data suggest that epiphytic microbial communities on a dominant filamentous alga (Cladophora glomerate) could play a role in in situ methylmercury production. Because peak in situ methylmercury production coincides with the period of the highest biological productivity during summer baseflow, methylmercury produced internally may be efficiently routed into local stream food webs. Our study provides strong evidence that stream channels, especially those associated with high primary productivity, can be important for regulating the bioavailability and toxicity of this global contaminant.

Despite abundant fossils available for detailed morphological analyses, little is known about the phylogenetic relationships of the fossil individuals to contemporary roe deer. We generated near-complete mitochondrial genomes for four roe deer remains from Northeastern China to explore the genetic connection of the ancient roe deer to the extant populations and to investigate the evolutionary history and population dynamics of this species. Phylogenetic analyses indicated the four ancient samples fall into three out of four different haplogroups of the Siberian roe deer. Haplogroup C, distributed throughout Eurasia, have existed in Northeastern China since at least the Late Pleistocene, while haplogroup A and D, found in the east of Lake Baikal, emerged in Northeastern China after the Mid Holocene. The Bayesian estimation suggested that the first split within the Siberian roe deer occurred approximately 0.34 million years ago (Ma). Moreover, Bayesian skyline plot analyses suggested that the Siberian roe deer had a population increase between 325 and 225 thousand years ago (Kya) and suffered a transient decline between 50 and 18 Kya. This study provides novel insights into the evolutionary history and population dynamics of the roe deer.					; Sheng, Guilian/O-2197-2013; Xiao, Bo/KBB-8047-2024	Kim, Kyung Seok/0000-0001-9683-0428; Westbury, Michael/0000-0003-0478-3930; Xiao, Bo/0000-0002-2640-923X; Sheng, Gui-Lian/0000-0003-2314-1650; Deng, Miaoxuan/0000-0002-6932-587X														2073-4425				JAN	2022	13	1							114	10.3390/genes13010114	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes13010114								35052455					WOS:000757644700001

The traditional field monitoring of lake ice requires a lot of manpower and material resources, and the timeliness is poor, so it is not suitable for long-term ice condition monitoring. Since 1960s, remote sensing image has been used because of its wide range, fast speed, low cost and so on. More and more widely used in all kinds of research, the long-term monitoring of lake ice can also use remote sensing monitoring. Based on the Landsat series of remote sensing data, the Neural Network Algorithm was used to study the remote sensing image of Namco lake in the lake ice segmentation.

During a survey of the myxosporean fauna of Lake Balaton fish, heart myxobolosis was found in the common bream, Abramis brama, with heavy infection of the ventricle and the bulbus arteriosus in some infected bream. Developing and mature plasmodia were mostly in the connective tissue of the subepicardium and subendocardium. Plasmodia developing in the subendocardium protruded into the lumen of the heart, while plasmodia developing in the subepicardium protruded over the epicardium forming large sausage-like outgrowths. Plasmodia with mature spores were found in the summer. The shape and size of the spores corresponded to those of the original description. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 18S rDNA sequence of M. dogieli showed that this species fit well in the genus Myxobolus.

The glacier in the Encierro valley, northern Chile, reached about 60% of its late-Pleistocene extent. The equilibrium line altitude ELA during this advance remained between 4250 and 4500 m which is above the modern 0 degrees C isotherm of the free atmosphere during summer. It is suggested that, given the specific climate at high elevations in the extremely arid Andes, a substantial increase in effective moisture is sufficient to explain this advance, whereas no significant temperature depression was needed. This compares favourably with the regional late-Holocene climatic history, when lake levels were higher and effective moisture greater than today between 3000 and 1800 BP. Judging from regional palaeodata, we suggest that this late-Holocene humid spell was most likely related to increased Westerly moisture sources from the Pacific.																			0959-6836					JUL	1998	8	4					473	479		10.1191/095968398677627864	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/095968398677627864													WOS:000075390900010

Truman Reservoir, Missouri	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Large-river fishes (e.g., sturgeons [Acipenseridae] and Paddlefish Polyodon spathula) that inhabit reservoir systems are potentially unable to sense environmental cues that elicit typical life history behaviors. These cues can be masked by altered hydrology and temperature regimes. In many reservoirs throughout North America, Paddlefish populations are potentially affected by these unnatural conditions. In an attempt to understand and identify the potential mechanisms that limit Paddlefish reproduction in reservoir systems, we selected Harry S. Truman Reservoir (Truman Lake), Missouri, as our study area of focus. This population is supplemented by stocking, and although anecdotal evidence of potential natural reproduction exists, spawning has never been documented. We implanted ultrasonic transmitters into 113 reproductively mature Paddlefish, and the movements of these fish were tracked over 2 years. Paddlefish migratory behavior was significantly related to water temperature and gauge height, and differences in movement behaviors existed between sexes. Spring aggregations were located in the riverine portion of the Osage River, and embryos and larvae were sampled in 2015 and 2016 near said aggregations. Using acoustic telemetry and egg mats, we acquired evidence suggesting that the Truman Lake Paddlefish are spawning. Our technique can likely be applied to determine spawning locations for Paddlefish inhabiting other large reservoirs.

Muskellunge Population Assessment in Two North-Central Minnesota Lakes Aided by Angler Participation	MUSKELLUNGE MANAGEMENT: FIFTY YEARS OF COOPERATION AMONG ANGLERS, SCIENTISTS, AND FISHERIES BIOLOGISTS	American Fisheries Society Symposium				Hugh C Becker Memorial Muskie Symposium: 50 Years of Cooperation - Anglers, Science and Management	MAR 13-15, 2016	Minnetonka, MN	Hugh C Becker Fdn, Muskies Inc, Amer Fisheries Soc, N Central Div, Esocid Tech Comm				A population assessment of Muskellunge Esox masquinongy in two connected north-central Minnesota lakes allowed evaluation of angler data when assessing various population metrics, including the residual effects of historical stocking efforts, as a nonlocal strain had been introduced into the native population during the 1970s. In 2012, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources sampled and marked Muskellunge using trap nets during the pre spawn and spawning periods and electrofishing during the postspawn period, while anglers collected data from fish caught during the 2012 open-water season. Anglers released all fish after collecting a scale for genetic analysis. Micro satellite DNA genotypes were used to differentiate individuals, thus identifying recaptures, and to estimate ancestry derived from the stocked strain. Anglers reported catching 16% of individuals marked by biologists. Of Muskellunge reported by anglers, 78% were from the lake where they were initially captured while 22% were reported in the lake opposite their initial capture. Postspawn movements suggeited that more individuals migrated from the lake characterized as having preferred spawning and nursery habitat to the lake characterized as having preferred summer habitat and prey. The age- and length-frequency distributions of fish captured by anglers and trap nets were similar, while electro-fishing sampled younger and smaller fish, likely because it occurred postspawn when many adults had moved off shore. The best estimate of adult population size was produced by a model incorporating fish length as a covariate. Density was estimated at 0.70 adults per ha or 1.92 adults per littoral ha. Higher percentages of nonlocal ancestry were associated with smaller maximum size potential (L.) in von Bertalanffy growth models. Our study described key population characteristics for a Muskellunge population while demonstrating that anglers could reliably collect several specific types of data that supplement data collected by management agencies.

Analyzing hydroclimatic changes during the late Holocene, as a modern warming analog, could provide key insights for forecasting water system responses to rising global temperatures. A general drying trend spanning the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age has been observed in both Yellow River and Mekong River Sourced Regions. However, the Yangtze River Source Region, which nearly covers half the Three-River Source Region, shows no conclusive evidence of this pattern, highlighting the urgency of further studies to resolve this spatial inconsistency. Here, with the assistance of proxies from organic carbon and carbonate contents, we used stable carbon and oxygen isotopes, and grain size distribution from a sedimentary core in Saiyong Co, to reconstruct regional hydroclimatic changes of the Yangtze River Source Region over the past 1700 years. Our new records reveal a regional aridity trend over the past millennium in the Yangtze River Source Region, consistent with records from surrounding regions. Specifically, Saiyong Co's hydroclimatic history is characterized by three distinct phases: relatively wet conditions from AD 200 to AD 1100, relatively dry conditions from AD 1100 to AD 1850, and a shift towards significantly wet conditions since AD 1850. By comparing these records with well-established climatic and tropical symbolic records, we probe the mechanism driving regional hydroclimatic changes across millennial trend and centennial timescales. The millennial drying trend can be largely attributed to the gradual weakening of the Indian Summer Monsoon, while centennial-scale hydroclimatic variations over the past millennium aligns with ENSO events. Since AD 1850, intensified monsoon precipitation and rising temperatures suggest a transition towards wetter conditions in the Yangtze River Source Region, a shift that demands further monitoring and investigation. These findings establish a vital baseline for evaluating climate change impacts on the Yangtze River Source Region's long-term ecological sustainability.						li, xiang zhong/0000-0003-3491-8824													0277-3791	1873-457X				OCT 1	2025	365								109483	10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109483	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109483													WOS:001514534400001

These were evaluated by measuring a large multicompartment dataset of PFAAs concentrations at coastal Livingston and Deception Islands (maritime Antarctica) during three austral summers. PFAAs were abundant in atmospheric-derived samples (aerosols, rain, snow), consistent with the importance of atmospheric deposition as an input of PFAAs to Antarctica. Such PFAAs deposition was unequivocally demonstrated by the occurrence of PFAAs in small Antarctic lakes. Several lines of evidence supported the relevant amplification of PFAAs concentrations in surface waters driven by snow scavenging of sea-spray aerosol-bound PFAAs followed by snow-melting. For example, vertical profiles showed higher PFAAs concentrations at lower-salinity surface seawaters, and PFAAs concentrations in snow were significantly higher than in seawater. The higher levels of PFAAs at Deception Island than at Livingston Island are consistent with the semi-enclosed nature of the bay. Concentrations of PFOS decreased from 2014 to 2018, consistent with observations in other oceans. The sink of PFAAs due to the biological pump, transfer to the food web, and losses due to sea-spray aerosols alone are unlikely to have driven the decrease in PFOS concentrations. An exploratory assessment of the potential sinks of PFAAs suggests that microbial degradation of perfluoroalkyl sulfonates should be a research priority for the evaluation of PFAAs persistence in the coming decade.

To assess factors controlling the sources and enrichment processes of P in Quaternary aquifers, 355 groundwater samples were collected in the Jianghan Plain of central Yangtze River Basin. In the phreatic aquifer, the total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) concentrations range from below detection limit (BDL) to 2.56mg/L, with 6.25% of samples exceeding 1 mg/L; in the confined aquifer, TDP concentrations range from BDL to 4.31 mg/L, with 22.18% of samples exceeding 1 mg/L. Factor analysis and correlationwere used to determine major factors controlling P enrichment in the groundwater. Elevated levels of P in the confined aquifer are related to reductive dissolution of P-rich Fe(III)-(hydr)oxides (FeOOH) as well as organic phosphorus (OP) mineralization. The SEDEX sequential extraction procedure was applied to core samples from two boreholes with high and low P levels in groundwater, respectively, to characterize phosphorus speciation in aquifer sediments. Bioavailable P, particularly exchangeable P, in sediments with high P groundwater are significantly higher than thosewith lowP groundwater. The content of Fe-bound P is higher than that of residual organic P (Res-OP) in sediments fromboth boreholes, indicating the greater contribution of reductive dissolution of P-rich FeOOH to geogenic P enrichment in groundwater than OP mineralization. Using the Redfield ratio, groundwater samples collected fromthe confined aquifer can be divided into three groups, with 65% of the samples falling into the group closely related to reduction of FeOOH. The present research provides newinsights into the enrichment of geogenic P in groundwater systems, which are not only applicable in the Jianghan Plain, but also to other similar alluvial aquifers in floodplains and delta regions worldwide.

J	LAST, WM				LAST, WM			SEDIMENTOLOGY OF PLAYA LAKES OF THE NORTHERN GREAT PLAINS	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The semi-arid plains of western Canada and northern USA contain a large number of saline and hypersaline lakes, with many of the shallow lakes exhibiting playa characteristics. For over 60 yr a number of these playas have provided a source of valuable industrial minerals. The modern sediments and sedimentary processes operating in selected playa basins located throughout the northern Great Plains region are studied. The playas generally occupy small, closed basins commonly having an elongate, riverine shape. Most of the brines are dominated by Na, Mg and SO42- ions; but examples of lakes rich in Cl- and HCO3- ions are also present. Significant variation in the brine chemistry can exist on a seasonal as well as a diurnal basis. The modern sediments of the playa consist of: very soluble salts of mainly Na and Mg sulfates and carbonates; sparingly soluble precipitates, including calcite, protodolomite, gypsum and mixed layer clays; detrital minerals consisting dominantly of quartz, carbonates, feldspars and clays; and organic matter. Much of the physical and mineralogical character of the playas is due to processes that are largely of a chemical nature and are associated with either evaporative concentration of the brines or groundwater discharge. The most significant processes include: cyclic flooding and desiccation of the playa surface, formation of salt crusts, efflorescent crusts, spring deposits, and intrasedimentary salts, formation of solution pits and chimneys, wind displacement of brines, and periodic detrital sedimentation by sheet flow and wind. These processes combine to create a very dynamic modern depositional environment. The establishment and prolonged maintenance of delicate physical and chemical equilibria have allowed the deposition of over 40 m of salt in some basins.

J	STAUFFER, TM				STAUFFER, TM			COLLECTING GEAR FOR LAKE TROUT EGGS AND FRY	PROGRESSIVE FISH-CULTURIST												Various types of gear for sampling eggs and fry of lake trout (S. namaycush) were tested in Lakes Superior and Michigan during 1973-1979. One type consisted of pails set in spawning substrate before lake trout spawned. Some were lifted soon after spawning to determine number of eggs deposited; others were left until spring when traps mounted atop the pails caught fry that hatched from eggs previously deposited in the pails. For collecting on lake trout spawning grounds, centrifugal pumps, which sucked up water and organisms from spawning substrate, were effective both for eggs and sac fry. Pyramidal wire-mesh traps, set on lake trout spawning areas, were very effective in catching fry in May and June. Plastic minnow traps also caught fry on spawning areas. Two versions of a 1.2-m beam trawl equipped with ticklers were moderately effective for fry on rough-bottomed spawning areas and on nearby smooth, hard bottom during May-July. A 5-m otter trawl, fished at night near spawning grounds, was effective for collecting fry on moderately smooth bottom in June and July.																			0033-0779						1981	43	4					186	193		10.1577/1548-8659(1981)43[186:CGFLTE]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1981)43[186:CGFLTE]2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1981MW83300005

The results from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) obtained from two summer sampling campaigns in 26 selected lakes and reservoirs demonstrated presence of the anaC gene, responsible for ATX production in 21 strains of the genus. They were found in three waterbodies sampled in 2018 (coastal lake Vaya, coastal reservoir Poroy, inland reservoir Sinyata Reka) and in four waterbodies sampled in 2019 (inland reservoirs Duvanli, Koprinka, Plachidol 2, Sinyata Reka). The detected genetic diversity generally corresponds to the observations conducted by conventional light microscopy, by which we distinguished three species of Cuspidothrix (Cuspidothrix issatschenkoi, Cuspidothrix elenkinii and Cuspidothrix tropicalis, the latter considered alien in the country). Eleven strains showed high similarity to two sequences of C. issatschenkoi available from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Ten other strains assembled in a group, which-in lack of available from NCBI genetic sequences-were presumed related to C. tropicalis and C. elenkinii after comparison with the results from light microscopy. Cuspidothrix strains found in Bulgarian waterbodies showed high genetic similarity to those isolated and sequenced from Asia (Japan, China) and Northern Europe (Norway, Finland).

Diurnal variation in the convection-driven vertical distribution of phytoplankton under ice and after ice-off in large Lake Onego (Russia)	INLAND WATERS												When sunlight penetrates the ice layer covering lakes in winter, it warms the top water layer and sets up convection, with several potentially contrasting effects on phytoplankton. While convective mixing keeps cells in suspension and prevents sedimentation losses, it may also transport phytoplankton well below the euphotic zone. We investigated diurnal variations in the vertical distribution of phytoplankton under ice and just after ice-off in Lake Onego (Russia), a lake with moderate to high colored dissolved organic carbon (CDOM) levels. We showed that diurnal variation in convection under ice restricts phytoplankton access to light in the morning hours to a narrow euphotic zone, whereas cells are mixed through a deep aphotic layer in the afternoon. After ice-off, low chlorophyll a was found on the open-water side of the thermal bar as convection distributed cells throughout the water column. By contrast, the inshore side had significantly higher concentrations of chlorophyll a (p<0.001) because the mixing depth brought about by diurnal microstratification was reduced, resulting in greater access to light in the afternoon. Overnight, convective cooling broke down microstratification, which redeveloped the next day. Our work highlights the importance of studying diurnal variation in light availability for photoautotrophic growth, both under ice and after ice-off in lakes characterized by high CDOM.

J	Zhang, YP				Zhang, YP			Life history of Hydatophylax intermedius (Trichoptera, Limnephilidae) in Hokkaido, northern Japan	AQUATIC INSECTS												The life history of Hydatophylax intermedius Schmid was studied in Shojin Creek and Bankei Lake, Sapporo, Hokkaido, northern Japan, from June 1993 to June 1994. This species was univoltine with a spring adult period. Larvae first occurred in early June, developed to fifth instar by September, and overwintered in the last instar. Cases were tubular and made of pieces of leaves and stems of aquatic plants and terrestrial leaves in early instar larvae, and fragments of bark and twigs of terrestrial debris, sometimes incorporating some mineral grains, in fifth instar larvae and pupae. Larvae chiefly lived among emergent water plants and submerged roots of terrestrial plants. Only males were collected by a black light trap and an extremely high ratio of males was collected by hand in the field, while nearly equal numbers of males and females emerged from lab-reared pupae. The initial and peak of emergence of males occurred 2-3 days earlier than those of females. Females deposited egg masses on stems and leaves of emergent aquatic plants 0-15 cm above water.																			0165-0424					OCT	1996	18	4					223	231		10.1080/01650429609361625	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01650429609361625													WOS:A1996VV48800003

These changes are reflected in the warming of the water column, the apparent deoxygenation of the epilimnion, and the accumulation of organic matter (OM), toxic sulfide, and ammonium in the anoxic hypolimnion. Since the early 1990s, the volume of anoxic water has increased as the chemocline has moved to the surface water layer. A trend toward enrichment of refractory dissolved organic car-bon (DOC) was observed in the anoxic hypolimnion, while a decreasing trend was observed in the oxic epilimnion in the spring DOC. At the same time, the most reactive surface-active fraction of DOC showed the opposite trend. In addition, there is evidence of accumulation of particulate organic carbon (POC) in the water column, followed by an increase in the fraction of POC in total organic carbon (TOC).On a multi-year scale (1996-2020), this work presents a unique time series of the dynamics of OM in the stratified ma-rine system, showing a significant change in its quantity and quality due to climate and environmental variability.DOC-normalized surfactant activity is shown to be a good indicator of environmental change.					; ciglenecki, irena/N-8792-2013	Matek, Antonija/0000-0002-2063-3417; Ciglenecki, Irena/0000-0002-1873-6193; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				MAR 20	2023	865								161076	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.161076	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.161076		JAN 2023						36565878					WOS:000915383200001

WATER												The management of water levels in wetlands is of great importance for the wetland ecosystem, including the conservation and revitalization of plants. However, the water level requirements (WLRs) of wetland plants have not been well investigated. In this study, Typha angustifolia was selected as an experimental plant species. Combining field investigation and simulation experiments, the relationship between the development status of this species and water level fluctuations (WLFs) in different life-history stages were analyzed. The results show that populations in the Yangtze floodplain, China, had two phenotypic forms 'tall' and 'short', and that these were distributed in lakes with intermittent or quasi-natural fluctuations and reservoir-like fluctuations, respectively. Lakes with high amplitude (>3.2 m) water fluctuations did not contain T. angustifolia. We investigated the distribution and growth of T. angustifolia in lakes of varying hydrology across the Yangtze floodplain, seeking to define its tolerance of water-level fluctuations and submergence at different stages in its life cycle. The upper tolerance limit of static submerged water depth was bounded by 1.5 times the height of plants in the seedling stage, and the upper tolerance limit of the submergence rate in the seedling stage was the average growth rate of seedling, 1.5 cm/d. The plant height had a positive linear correlation with amplitude and water depth from June to July. The autumn biomass was significantly negatively correlated with amplitude and water depth from January to May. This paper is perhaps the first case study on water level fluctuation requirements (WLFRs) of emergent macrophytes. It systematically assessed the WLFRs of T. angustifolia in each life-history stage, and established a comprehensive WLFR conceptual model. The results of this study could provide a quantitative operational basis for the protection and restoration of this species in Yangtze floodplain lakes.

Effects of Local Weather Variation on Water-column Stratification and Hypoxia in the Western, Sandusky, and Central Basins of Lake Erie	WATER												Hypoxia, low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations (<2 mg/L), has been a major issue in Lake Erie for decades. While much emphasis has been placed on biological factors, particularly algal blooms, contributing to hypolimnetic oxygen depletion, there has been little focus on the role of weather. For this study, we monitored water temperature and DO concentrations at sites in the western, central, and Sandusky basins in Lake Erie during June and July 2010-2012. We then compared trends in stratification and DO concentrations to weather patterns during that period. We found that during those three years, there was significant variation in weather patterns, particularly decreased ice coverage and increased storm events in 2012. These weather patterns corresponded to 2012 having the warmest water temperatures, some of the lowest DO concentrations, and a deeper and thinner hypolimnion (especially in the central basin) than the previous years. We found a relationship between weather and hypoxia, providing further evidence for why these basins are susceptible to low DO conditions during summer months. The role of weather in hypoxia is another indication that the lake is vulnerable to effects of climate change and should be considered in management strategies.

Sensitivity of mesoscale model urban boundary layer meteorology to the scale of urban representation	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Mesoscale modeling of the urban boundary layer requires careful parameterization of the surface due to its heterogeneous morphology. Model estimated meteorological quantities, including the surface energy budget and canopy layer variables, will respond accordingly to the scale of representation. This study examines the sensitivity of the surface energy balance, canopy layer and boundary layer meteorology to the scale of urban surface representation in a real urban area (Detroit-Windsor (USA-Canada)) during several dry, cloud-free summer periods. The model used is the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with its coupled single-layer urban canopy model. Some model verification is presented using measurements from the Border Air Quality and Meteorology Study (BAQS-Met) 2007 field campaign and additional sources. Case studies span from "neighborhood" (10 s similar to 308 m) to very coarse (120 s similar to 3.7 km) resolution. Small changes in scale can affect the classification of the surface, affecting both the local and grid-average meteorology. Results indicate high sensitivity in turbulent latent heat flux from the natural surface and sensible heat flux from the urban canopy. Small scale change is also shown to delay timing of a lake-breeze front passage and can affect the timing of local transition in static stability.																			1680-7316	1680-7324					2011	11	6					2951	2972		10.5194/acp-11-2951-2011	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-11-2951-2011													WOS:000288982300034

HAs were taken from bottom sediments of Lobelia Lake in Western Pomerania in Poland. Bottom sediments were sampled during summer stagnation from depths corresponding to three thermal zones of the lake: A - epilimnion (4.4 m), t(A) = 19.5 degrees C; B - metalimnion (8.0 m), t(B) = 14.8 degrees C; and, C - hypolimnion (49 m), t(C) = 6.0 degrees C. Sediments were also taken from 0 - 35 cm depth. In each zone, three distinctly separate layers differing in colour were observed. HAs were extracted with 0.1 M NaOH from each layer of sediment. The elemental composition of sediments was similar to fulvic acids (FAs) from soil, but N concentration in the HAs was twofold higher. IR spectra showed that HAs from the epilimnion zone differed markedly in chemical structure from HAs of other zones. Comparison of the thermic destruction effect of HAs showed that their energetic values increased with depth from the epilimnion to the hypolimnion zone.

Quantitatively, somatic growth differed in timing and extent among age-sex groups. One+ males and females grew mostly in June whereas 2+ males grew mainly in July; 2+ females grew from June through September. Two+ males grew less over the year than did the other age-sex groups. The qualitative characteristics of somatic growth were not influenced by sex or maturation. The timing of gonadal growth and the associated endogenous energy utilization differed between the sexes. One+ females did not mature. Testes grew in late summer (August). There was no impact of gonad development on somatic composition of 1+ males whereas 2+ males appeared to use visceral fat. Gonadal growth for 2+ females began in August and continued through March and presumably to spawning in April; somatic lipid was depleted during ovarian growth.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JUN	1989	46	6					989	994		10.1139/f89-128	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f89-128													WOS:A1989AA26400012

The project has set as its objective the creation of a small "tourist district" able to host and make different tourism businesses better express themselves. The initiatives of these companies are presently focused on an area of 300,000 m(2) of private property, occupied by two artificial lakes resulting from the reuse of disused quarries, but the project involves the territory requalification of over 90 ha of a highly degraded area. On the whole, the project provided for the construction of a BIO-PARK dedicated to welfare, culture and sustainable tourism, all included in a frame of particular natural value. The study area represents a portion of the campanian plain area included in the relevant area of Castel Volturno Municipality, near Caserta. This area falls within the perimeter of the area called "Lago Patria and neighbouring lakes" inside the SIN (Site of National Interest) Domitian Phlegrean and Agro Aversano Coast (Law n(o) 426/98).					; Calandrelli, Roberto/JUV-5471-2023; Calandrelli, Marina/AAX-6360-2020	CALANDRELLI, MARINAMAURA/0000-0001-7268-0939; Calandrelli, Roberto/0000-0002-7117-3457; 															978-3-319-09048-1; 978-3-319-09047-4				2015							1315	1319		10.1007/978-3-319-09048-1_251	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09048-1_251													WOS:000359015000251

Human-enhanced atmospheric nitrogen deposition has caused profound N:P imbalance in many remote oligotrophic lakes in which phosphorus has largely become limiting. These lakes offer an opportunity to investigate the relationship between the changes in plankton stoichiometry, productivity, and community structure occurring during nutrient fluctuations in P-limited conditions. We performed P (PO43-) and N (NH4+ or NO3-) pulse additions to the summer epilimnetic community of an ultraoligotrophic lake using self-filling similar to 100-L enclosures and analyzed the response to varying P availability, N:P imbalance, and N source. Seston C:N:P proportions remained fairly unchanged to P additions that were within the range of values seasonally found in the lake. However, the seston N:P ratio abruptly shifted and approached Redfield's proportions at P additions typical of mesotrophic conditions that provided non-limiting conditions. N surplus did not affect seston C:N:P proportions. The patterns of seston N:P stability and shift were similar for both N sources. In contrast, productivity was highly sensitive to low and medium P additions and decelerated at high P additions. Phytoplankton biomass dominated particulate organic matter. The autotrophic community differentiated almost linearly across the P gradient. Chrysophytes' dominance decreased, and diatoms and cryptophytes relative abundance increased. Nonetheless, the stoichiometry stability and non-linear shift involved large biomass proportions of the same species, which indicates that the bulk stoichiometry was related to similar physiological behavior of phylogenetically diverse organisms according to the biogeochemical context. The C:N:P seston stability in P-limited conditions-with loose coupling with productivity, nutrient supply ratios, and species dominance-and the sudden shift to Redfield proportions in P-repleted conditions suggest a complex regulation of P scarcity in planktonic communities that goes beyond immediate acclimation growth responses and might include alternative physiological and biogeochemical states.

J	Toda, K; Kuwahara, H; Ohira, SI				Toda, Kei; Kuwahara, Haruka; Ohira, Shin-Ichi			On-Site Measurement of Trace-Level Sulfide in Natural Waters by Vapor Generation and Microchannel Collection	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Aqueous sulfide plays an important role in the environment even at low concentrations. However, it is unstable, which means field samples cannot be transported to the laboratory for analysis without fixation. In this work, a novel method was developed to determine trace levels of sulfide on site. This method is based on vapor generation and collection in a special microchannel device followed by fluorescence measurement (VG-mu GAS). The microchannel scrubber gave a high enrichment factor, and a high sensitivity was achieved, which allowed measurement of nanomolar (nM) levels of sulfide. The theoretical approach to vapor generation for several compounds is discussed to evaluate the applicability of the method to these analytes, and compounds having a low Henry's law constant (<1 M atm(-1)) are suitable to measure by VG-mu GAS. Under optimized conditions, concentrations of 1.0-100 nM of sulfide could be measured. The sulfide contents of hot spring, aquarium, pond, and seawater were successfully measured by this method. Nanomolar levels of sulfide could be measured on site without loss of analyte, and results were obtained instantly in the field, both of which are advantageous for effective field surveys. The method was also applied to field measurements of aqueous sulfide in the Ariake Sea and Lake Baikal.

Herein, we provide new and numerical reconstructions for annual mean precipitation (PANN) and vegetation history over the last 18,000 years using high-resolution pollen data from Lakes Dalianhai and Qinghai on the northeastern QTP. Hitherto, five calibration techniques including weighted averaging, weighted average-partial least squares regression, modern analogue technique, locally weighted weighted averaging regression, and maximum likelihood were first employed to construct robust inference models and to produce reliable PANN estimates on the QTP. The biomization method was applied for reconstructing the vegetation dynamics. The study area was dominated by steppe and characterized with a highly variable, relatively dry climate at similar to 18,000-11,000 cal years B.P. PANN increased since the early Holocene, obtained a maximum at similar to 8000-3000 cal years B.P. with coniferous-temperate mixed forest as the dominant biome, and thereafter declined to present. The PANN reconstructions are broadly consistent with other proxy-based paleoclimatic records from the northeastern QTP and the northern region of monsoonal China. The possible mechanisms behind the precipitation changes may be tentatively attributed to the internal feedback processes of higher latitude (e.g., North Atlantic) and lower latitude (e.g., subtropical monsoon) competing climatic regimes, which are primarily modulated by solar energy output as the external driving force. These findings may provide important insights into understanding the future Asian precipitation dynamics under the projected global warming.

We investigate the circulation patterns causing extreme precipitation in SES and Mongolia, by examining the instability and moisture transport associated with potential vorticity (PV) dynamics during two time periods: 1982-1998 and 1999-2019. The EPE were characterized by an increase in instability within the precipitation area, which was compensated by stability around the area, with the East Asian summer monsoon transport being enhanced. PV in the subtropical regions and mid-latitudes has shown the amplification of positive and negative PV anomalies to the southeast and northwest of Lake Baikal, respectively. The PV contours for EPE have shapes of cyclonic wave breaking and cutoff low. EPE accompanied by wave breaking are characterized by strong redistribution areas, with extremely high and low stability and moisture. This can lead to the coexistence of floods and droughts, and in part was the driver of the earlier revealed "seesaw" precipitation mode over Mongolia and SES. We suggest a shift of extreme precipitation to the northwest has occurred, which was probably caused by the wave propagation change.					; Belan, Boris/A-6506-2014; Arshinov, Mikhail/A-5953-2014; Antokhina, Olga/A-5312-2014	Antokhin, Pavel/0000-0003-4064-5594; Gochakov, Aleksander/0000-0001-9909-9730; Antokhina, Olga/0000-0002-2120-3574; Zbirannik, Anna/0000-0001-7417-3068														2073-4433				MAR	2023	14	3							480	10.3390/atmos14030480	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos14030480													WOS:000955165200001

Furthermore, quantification of the biogenic impact on the biogeochemical Si cycle has attracted significant scientific interest since biological control has been suggested. Previous observations of seasonal variations in the dissolved Si isotopic pattern further imply that high-frequency riverine sampling during main hydrological events might provide important information about natural processes governing the fluvial biogeochemical Si cycle. Therefore, temporal variations in the isotopic composition of riverine dissolved Si were investigated for the Kalix River, Northern Sweden, the largest pristine river system in Europe, based on high-frequency sampling during a period of 25 weeks from early April to early October 2006. Temporal variations spanning 0.4 parts per thousand for delta Si-39 and 0.8 parts per thousand for delta Si-35 of dissolved Si in the Kalix River were observed during the period, suggesting that the riverine dissolved Si input to the oceans cannot be considered to have a constant Si isotopic composition on a short time scale. The results implicate biogeochemical Si-cycling via formation and dissolution of biogenic silica as processes significantly affecting the dissolved Si transport in boreal systems during April to early October. The Si budget in the river system appeared to be controlled by relative Si enrichment during high discharge events and relative Si depletions in the subarctic mountainous and lake dominated areas. The Si enrichments and depletions were accompanied by decreasing and increasing riverine delta Si-29 and delta Si-30, respectively. These isotope variations can be explained by release of plant derived silica, depleted in heavier Si isotopes, during the spring snowmelt. Further, increased volumetric contribution from the headwater and losses of dissolved Si due to biogenic silica formation by diatoms in the subarctic lakes at a later period are expected to be responsible for the preferential losses of lighter isotopes, as further verified by land cover analysis.

Temporal analysis of net fluvial methylmercury loading in a dystrophic and a clear water lake	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The concentration of methylmercury (MeHg) in aquatic ecosystems is the net result of the highly dynamic abiotic and biotic processes of mercury methylation and demethylation. In this study, we conduct an examination of the net fluvial loading of methyltnercury (MeHg(Net)=MeHg(Watershed)-MeHg(Lake) (outflow)) across a 3 year time frame in both a dystrophic lake and an oligotrophic lake. A significant portion of MeHg(Net) variance in both lakes could be attributed to a seasonal pattern (11.4%, p = 0.009; oligotrophic, and 27.0%, p < 0.0001; dystrophic) which in both cases, was most correlated with air temperature. The dystrophic lake appeared to be a net source of methylmercury (MeHg(Net)=-1.9 +/- 0.3 mg MeHg d(-1)) while the oligotrophic lake appeared to be a net sink (MeHg(Net) = 0.4 +/- 0.2 mg MeHg d(-1)), indicating that there was net methylation in the dystrophic lake and net demethylation in the oligotrophic lake. Higher MeHg loading to the lakes occurred during the summer and between seasons there was a difference in MeHgNet Of 1.1 +/- 0.3 mg MeHg d(-1) and 3.1 +/- 0.6 mg MeHg d(-1). Seasonal patterns of MeHg(Net) in the oligotrophic lake lagged behind the dystrophic lake by 39 days. The short term variation in MeHg(Net) was dominated by precipitation (t = 2.73. p = 0.008; dystrophic. t = 2.53. p = 0.017; oligotrophic). Crown Copyright (c) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Although it is obvious that fossil fuel combustion (presumably from automobile exhaust) is the dominant source for CO in Los Angeles, domestic wood burning in winter or some other non-fossil fuel sources may contribute as much as 17% CO to the atmospheric burden in some areas of Los Angeles.

C) selected by snapping turtles placed in a controlled aquatic thermal gradient. Body temperatures from eight adult snapping turtles in three different lakes in Algonquin Provincial Park were monitored by radiotelemetry during July and August 1987. Mean body temperature of all eight turtles over the study period was 22.7.degree. C, and mean temperature of every individual was well below the reported mean selected temperature for this species. The turtles did not maintain body temperatures near the available maximum environmental temperature. The mean body temperatures of the turtles were not significantly different among the three study lakes although these lakes had different physical characteristics. Similarly, there were no significant differences, among individual turtles, between air temperatures or operative environmental temperatures recorded concurrently with their body temperatures. Nevertheless, mean body temperatures differed significantly among individuals; foraging tactics, metabolic rates, and home range structure may account for these differences.

Berry			Patterns of hydrologic connectivity in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica: a synthesis of 20years of hydrologic data	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Streams in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs) of Antarctica moderate an important hydrologic and biogeochemical connection between upland alpine glaciers, valley-bottom soils, and lowland closed-basin lakes. Moreover, MDV streams are simple but dynamic systems ideal for studying interacting hydrologic and ecological dynamics. This work synthesizes 20years of hydrologic data, collected as part of the MDVs Long-Term Ecological Research project, to assess spatial and temporal dynamics of hydrologic connectivity between glaciers, streams, and lakes. Long-term records of stream discharge (Q), specific electrical conductance (EC), and water temperature (T) from 18 streams were analysed in order to quantify the magnitude, duration, and frequency of hydrologic connections over daily, annual, and inter-annual timescales. At a daily timescale, we observe predictable diurnal variations in Q, EC, and T. At an annual timescale, we observe longer streams to be more intermittent, warmer, and have higher median EC values, compared to shorter streams. Longer streams also behave chemostatically with respect to EC, whereas shorter streams are more strongly characterized by dilution. Inter-annually, we observe significant variability in annual runoff volumes, likely because of climatic variability over the 20 record years considered. Hydrologic connections at all timescales are vital to stream ecosystem structure and function. This synthesis of hydrologic connectivity in the MDVs provides a useful end-member template for assessing hydrologic connectivity in more structurally complex temperate watersheds.

Bhutan's complex, often high-altitude terrain and the severe impact of the Indian summer monsoon leads to a strong exposure of the countries' key economic sectors (agriculture, forestry, hydropower generation and tourism) to climatic changes. Climate change also threatens Bhutan's vast biodiversity and increases the likelihood of natural hazards (e.g. glacier lake outburst floods, flash floods, droughts and forest fires). A better understanding of Bhutan's climate and its variability, as well as observed and possible climate impacts, will help in improving the handling of regional social, economic and ecologic challenges not limited to the Himalayas. Only a few climatological studies exist for the eastern Himalayas. They mainly focus on adaptation to immediate threats by glacier lake outbursts. In contrast, this paper (1) investigates the average spatial and inner-annual diversity of the air temperature regime of Bhutan, based on local meteorological observations, (2) discusses past temperature variability, based on global datasets, and (3) relates effects of observed warming to water availability, hydropower development, natural hazards, forests, biodiversity, agriculture, human health and tourism in the Bhutan Himalayas.

Lipid biomarker analysis of cyanobacteria-dominated microbial mats in meltwater ponds on the McMurdo Ice Shelf, Antarctica	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The lipid biomarker composition of microbial mat communities from three meltwater ponds from the McMurdo Ice Shelf, Antarctica, was investigated for the first time. Hydrocarbons, ether-linked components, fatty acids (FAs), wax esters, hopanols and sterols from Fresh, Orange and Salt Ponds were analysed. The dominance of cyanobacteria and the presence of bacterial sulfate reducers were confirmed using signature FAs in all three mats. Wax ester analysis suggested the presence of Chloroflexus spp. The dominance of short chain hydrocarbons, wax esters and FAs indicated that microorganisms are the major source of organic matter in these meltwater ponds. A variety of sterols were present in different relative abundances. The greatest diversity of sterols was in Salt Pond, followed by Fresh Pond, which was attributed to differences in the present eukaryotic diversity. Lipid profiles of the three communities were similar despite the presence of a salinity gradient. Analysis of lipid biomarkers allowed the creation of profiles for these unique Antarctic cryo-ecosystems. This will assist in the comparison of present and past microbial communities and in the monitoring of Antarctic biodiversity in response to global climate change and other environmental perturbations.

Nevertheless, Eared Grebes are present continuously at Mono Lake for several months, reaching peak numbers of 750,000 in late fall, when they feed primarily by diving for brine shrimp (Artemia sp.). The birds do not drink fresh water during their stay at Mono Lake. Yet, data on blood chemistry, osmolality of food and gut contents, and salt gland weights and their hypertrophy show that the ingestion of salt is not a major physiological problem for Eared Grebes in hypersaline environments. They evidently meet their water requirements from the body fluids of their prey, which are more dilute than the lake water, and minimize salt intake by minimizing the amount of water that they ingest during feeding. Their large tongue, which fills the oral cavity, is important in achieving this result.																				1938-5129					1985	87	3					389	397		10.2307/1367221	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1367221													WOS:A1985ASK0900012

Like many estuaries worldwide, the PRE experiences summer hypoxia because of intense stratification and eutrophication. AD provides a potential solution for short-term hypoxia relief via the mixture of surface and bottom water, but its oxygenation efficacy relying on both local hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry is largely uncertain. Our simulations suggest that AD has extremely low oxygenation efficacy in the PRE during the hypoxia period. The estimated oxygen transfer efficiency (OTE), defined as the rate of oxygen transfer per unit of power needed for pumping, varies between -0.81 and +0.92 kg O2 kWh-1. This is an order of magnitude less than the previous estimate of 10-100 kg kWh-1 in closed lakes and fjords. Moreover, a negative OTE means that AD sometimes backfires and exacerbates hypoxia in the bottom water. The above results remain unchanged when different values of engineering parameters including downwelling rate and discharging depth are used. Extremely low oxygenation efficacy is attributed to strong subtidal advection in the estuary as well as the engineering side effects including reduced vertical diffusion. It is likely that oceanic oxygen loss could be avoided by transporting surface water into the ocean interior with a network of pipes. This idea, also termed geoengineered artificial downwelling, has been tested with some success in closed lakes or fjords, but its oxygenation efficacy in open coastal environments remains inconclusive. In this study, we construct a coupled physical-biogeochemical model to assess the oxygenation efficacy of AD in the PRE, which is a large estuarine system experiencing summer hypoxia because of stratification and eutrophication. Our simulations conducted over a large range of hydrodynamic conditions and engineering parameters suggest that in the PRE the oxygen transfer efficiency (OTE) measuring the oxygenation efficacy is an order of magnitude less than the estimates in closed lakes and fjords and even negative sometimes. Therefore, AD could not address estuarine hypoxia in an energy-efficient way. Extremely low estimated OTE is a consequence of a large trade-off between physical and biogeochemical processes. While AD improves oxygen content in bottom water by enhanced vertical advection below the pycnocline and less deposition of organic matter inside the pipe region, this improvement is largely canceled by strong subtidal advection and reduced vertical diffusion. Artificial downwelling that pumps surface water into the bottom might not be an energy-efficient way to address estuarine hypoxia The oxygenation efficacy is extremely low and an order of magnitude less than that in closed lakes and fjords Poor bottom water oxygenation is related to the subtidal advection effect and reduced vertical diffusion					Lu, Wenfang/AGA-0661-2022; Luo, Qihao/KYR-3897-2024; Lu, Wenfang/O-7140-2017	Lu, Wenfang/0000-0003-1303-9820													2169-9275	2169-9291				MAY	2024	129	5							e2023JC020655	10.1029/2023JC020655	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023JC020655													WOS:001219619800001

In many hot, arid environs, whole tire losses are more common than in moderate climates, and lead to the accumulation of additional tire material on road sides, which over time can be the source of secondary micro-tires. Other rubber containing material from cars such as mud-flaps and floor mats has been seen as an appreciable additional source of micro-rubber. Due to the lack of precipitation, it is expected that modes of micro-tire relocation are more limited in arid regions than in more moderate climates. This 2-year study examines the rubber/tire content from 34 sampling sites within the region of Al Ain, Eastern region of Abu Dhabi Emirate, United Arab Emirates. The samplings include road dust, soil along roadsides, storm water run-off samples and samples collected in Wadis (creek beds that seasonally carry water) and one artificial lake. The mean average number of micro-tires in road dust was found to be 44.4 +/- 40.6 micro-tires/g. In soil samples alongside the roads, it was 22.8 +/- 42.1 micro-tires/g. The mean average size of micro-tires for all 34 sampling sites was found to be 106.9 +/- 98.5 mu m. It could be seen that rubber/tire materials desiccate over time during the high temperatures of the Emirati summer, become hard, brittle and break into smaller pieces, resulting in secondary micro-tire particles. The study of run-offs showed that tire particles are swept into storm drains during larger, very infrequently occurring rain events. However, the predominant mode of micro-tire transport was found to be on road by physical contact with cars, off-road by a combination of physical contact with moving objects and air movement. Samples taken from an artificial lake and three Wadis within the confines of Al Ain have shown only few micro-tire particles, so that the dispersion of micro-tires is not as pervasive as had been expected prior to this study.

Although samplings were carried out in summer, long after the acid shock caused by snowmelt, some lakes were found to be acidic and 47% of them show alkalinity values of below 50 mueq l-1. Losses in alkalinity (acidification levels) were evaluated using a titration model with variable F-factor. Factor analysis shows that the main factors influencing water chemistry are related to rock weathering and nitrate uptake by vegetation. In watersheds containing carbonatic rocks the weathering of calcite is responsible for the most of the alkalinity production. We therefore focused on a set of 19 low-alkalinity lakes in the Maggia Valley lying in watersheds containing mainly acidic rocks. Results show that the weathering of silicate and calcite (present in small quantities, but highly soluble) and nitrate uptake account for most of the alkalinity production. Other watershed and in-lake processes may be important in some cases, but they never account for more than 27% of the alkalinity production in these lakes.					; Mosello, Rosario/ABA-4690-2021; Marchetto, Aldo/H-3258-2013	Mosello, Rosario/0000-0002-1873-0162; Marchetto, Aldo/0000-0002-1033-4114													0018-8158					FEB 4	1994	274	1-3					75	81		10.1007/BF00014629	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00014629													WOS:A1994MX84100010

The results of indicator species analysis, canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and boosted regression tree (BRT) analysis suggest that: 1) soil-surface pollen assemblages can differentiate between desert, steppe, meadow steppe, cool broadleaved forest, cool conifer forest, and temperate forest, but fail to differentiate between steppe and forest steppe; shrub and temperate forest; and temperate broadleaved forest, temperate mixed conifer-broadleaved forest, and eurythermic conifer forest; 2) pollen taxa, with low percentages but frequent occurrences, strongly indicate presence in the vegetation; 3) mean annual precipitation (MAP) is the most dominant variable influencing soil-surface pollen assemblages and the most promising climate variable for quantitative reconstructions. Weighted averaging partial least squares regression (WA-PLS), modern analogue technique (MAT), and boosted regression trees (BRT) were used to construct a series of pollen-climate calibration sets. WA-PLS and MAT outperform BRT under leave-one-out cross-validation. WA-PLS models are less susceptible to spatial auto-correlation than MAT models, making WA-PLS models generally the best choice. Our soil-surface pollen data will contribute to modern pollen data in eastern Asia.

J	Wærvågen, SB; Andersen, T				Waervagen, Svein Birger; Andersen, Tom			Seasonal quantitative dynamics and ecology of pelagic rotifers in an acidified boreal lake	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Lake Gjerstadvann is a dimictic. oligotrophia, slightly acidified boreal lake in southern Noway (northwest Europe). The planktonic rotifer community of this lake was studied quantitatively during one year hr order to investigate the impacts of the local environment and biotic interactions on seasonal succession and habitat selection. Pure suspension feeders (mainly Kemtella spp., Conochilus spp., and Kellicottia longispina) together with raptorial graspers or specialised feeders (mainly Poharthra spp., and Collotheca spp,) dominated the rotifer community over prolonged periods, whereas carnivorous/omnivorous species (mainly Asplanchnapriodonta) were extremely uncommon. Low bicarbonate buffering capacity resulted in a distinctive seasonal oscillating pH between 5.0 and 5.6, defining a special acid-transition lake category. The pH values were highest in the productive period during summer, and lowest during ice break-up coinciding with the peak reactive aluminium concentrations of 250-300 mu g L-1. As in typical Norwegian boreal perch lakes, the most abundant cladoceran was Bosmina longispina due to perch predation on the genus Daphnia. Rotifer community structure was significantly related to temperature and oxygen (P=0.001 and P=0.022), illustrating the important effects of the seasonal cycle and vertical density stratification. The most significant competition indicator species were B, longispina and Eudiapiomus gracilis (both with P=0.001). A variance partitioning indicated that 14% of the total community composition variance could only he explained by biotic interactions, while 19% of the variance could be attributed to environmental gradients. Of the variance, 23% could not be resolved between biotic interactions and environmental gradients, while a residual of 44% was not explainable by any of the variables. Acid conditions alone cannot account for all the observed changes in the rotifer community of this lake with low humic content, since resource limitation and food competition are also important factors shaping rotifer population dynamics and the community structure.																			1129-5767	1723-8633					2018	77	1					147	163		10.4081/jlimnol.2017.1685	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2017.1685													WOS:000432877400012
J	Smith, JR; Fuelberg, HE; Watson, AI				Smith, JR; Fuelberg, HE; Watson, AI			Warm season lightning distributions over the northern Gulf of Mexico coast and their relation to synoptic-scale and mesoscale environments	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												Cloud-to-ground lightning data from the National Lightning Detection Network are used to create a warm season (May-September) lightning climatology for the northern Gulf Of Mexico coast for the 14-yr period 1989-2002. Each day is placed into one of five flow regimes based on the orientation of the low-level flow with respect to the coastline. This determination is made using the vector mean 1000-700-hPa wind data at Lake Charles and Slidell, Louisiana. Flash densities are calculated for daily, hourly, and nocturnal periods. Spatial patterns of composite 24-h and nocturnal flash density indicate that lightning decreases in an east-to-west direction over the region. Flash densities for the 24-h period Lire greatest over land near the coast, with relative maxima located near Houston, Texas; Lake Charles, Baton Rouge, and New Orleans, Louisiana; Biloxi, Mississippi; and Mobile, Alabama. Flash densities during the nocturnal period are greatest over the coastal waters. Lightning across the northern Gulf coast is closely related to the prevailing low-level synoptic flow, which controls the sea breeze, the dominant forcing mechanism during the warm season. Southwest flow, the most unstable and humid of the five regimes, exhibits the most flashes. In this case, sea-breeze-induced convection is located slightly inland from the coast. Northeast now, the driest and most stable of the regimes, exhibits the least amount of lightning. The large-scale flow restricts the sea breeze to near the coastline. Geographic features and local mesoscale circulations are found to affect lightning across the region. Geographic features include lakes, bays, marshes, swamps, and coastline orientations. Thermal circulations associated with these features interact with the main sea breeze to produce complex lightning patterns over the area.																			0882-8156	1520-0434				AUG	2005	20	4					415	438		10.1175/WAF870.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/WAF870.1													WOS:000231910200002

This also affects deep lakes, including volcanic ones. Volcanic lakes in the Mediterranean area are of great importance for the local economy, but local human activities can threaten their rich biodiversity. As a European biodiversity hotspot and habitat of endemic species, the volcanic Lake Bracciano (Central Italy) is an ecosystem of primary conservation interest threatened by sharply falling water levels, particularly since 2017. It also plays a key role in human wellbeing by providing important ecosystem services including drinking water, fisheries and various recreational opportunities. Although the lake has historically been considered to enjoy good ecological status, various environmental problems, often amplified by water level changes, have arisen during the last two decades. Given this recent rapid evolution, the lake can be considered an example of a valuable ecosystem at risk as a result of increasing anthropogenic pressures. The aim of this review is to examine the changes that have affected the lake in the last 20 years, considerably reducing its capacity to provide ecosystem services, and to review existing and potential threats in order to better inform the management of such resources.					; Sporta Caputi, Simona/AAL-1803-2021; Rossi, David/L-1665-2019	Careddu, Giulio/0000-0002-7553-9161; Sporta Caputi, Simona/0000-0003-2878-6175; Rossi, David/0000-0002-9089-3257; Ventura, Matteo/0000-0001-5866-7631; 														2073-4441				MAY 22	2023	15	10							1959	10.3390/w15101959	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15101959													WOS:000998297600001

A clear dose-response for SRP binding by the modified clay was observed. A small amount of ammonium is released from PhoslockA (R). We found no effect of PhoslockA (R) on pH or oxygen saturation. Conductivity increased with the increasing concentration of PhoslockA (R). An application of PhoslockA (R) caused a transient increase of turbidity up to 211 NTU. However, due to rapid settlement, turbidity fell below 13 NTU (similar to 1 m Secchi depth), after 6 h. Phoslock(A (R)) addition caused a reduction in growth of all phytoplankton species tested that we attribute to the combined effects of light limitation, flocculation with the bentonite and binding of SRP to Phoslock(A (R)). We estimated the EC50 of Phoslock(A (R)) on the population growth of rotifer B. calyciflorus to be 0.15 g Phoslock(A (R)) l(-1). Overall, the results of our study indicate Phoslock(A (R)) seems to be suitable for field applications.

All the lakes are ultra-oligotrophic and ice covered for 9-11 months each year, resulting in a photosynthetically distinctive seasonal environment with uniformly low water temperatures. The benthic communities are dominated by thick cyanobacterial mats in the deeper parts of all but the few shallow brackish lakes. In these brackish lakes, the photosynthetically active mats are located in the lake margins as the deeper parts of these lakes are strongly anoxic under winter ice cover. In the more freshwater lakes, a depth-related zonation of mat type was observed, which showed pigment modifications to a substantial depth consistent with measured penetration of PAR and UV radiation, even under the extensive ice cover. The thick organic deposits and intact mat structure at depth suggest slow decomposition rates within the mats. The plankton are almost entirely microbial, with two forms of planktonic rotifer and the cladoceran, Daphniopsis studeri present in very low numbers. A desmid, Cosmarium, occurred in relatively large numbers in Heart Lake, a coastal system. The desmid group is very rare in continental Antarctica. Abundances of bacteria, heterotrophic and phototrophic nanoflagellates, and ciliates were consistently low. Microbial community diversity is low when compared to other sites in continental Antarctica (e.g. Dry Valleys) but broadly comparable to that of freshwater lakes in the nearby Vestfold Hills. The invertebrate grazer is present in such low numbers that food web structure can be considered to have a single trophic level based on the microbial loop. In view of the sparse autotrophic plankton and barren catchments, DOC supply to the microbial heterotrophs was probably derived in large part from the benthic mats rather than from planktonic photosynthetic exudates.																			0003-9136					JAN	1998	141	2					209	230																WOS:000072478700006
J	OERLEMANS, J				OERLEMANS, J			THE ROLE OF ICE SHEETS IN THE PLEISTOCENE CLIMATE	NORSK GEOLOGISK TIDSSKRIFT												Northern hemisphere ice sheets have played an important role in the climatic evolution of the Pleistocene. The characteristic time-scale of ice-sheet growth has the same order-of-magnitude as that for the orbital insolation variations. The interaction with the solid earth, the importance of the thermal conditions at the base of ice sheets and feedback on the climate system (albedo feedback, precipitation regime) make the cryospheric response to climatic forcing complicated. Feedback of surface elevation on the surface mass balance allows northern hemisphere ice sheets to grow southward when cooler summer conditions prevail. Rapid ice-sheet decay, as observed in the paleo-record, must have involved one or more powerful destabilizing mechanisms like low accumulation rates at subpolar latitudes, high ice velocities due to water-saturated sediment beds, and high calving rates in proglacial lakes and seas. In terms of radiactive forcing of the global climatic fluctuations in the Pleistocene, the effects of northern hemisphere ice sheets (albedo), varying concentration of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane) and direct effect of orbital changes (insolation) are of similar magnitude.

The expansion of the breeding distribution has coincided with the increase in the population size. The changes in the breeding distributions in Svalbard of brent geese Branta bernicla and pink-footed geese Anser brachtyrhynchus appear to have been small, although the knowledge of the total breeding distributions in Svalbard of these two species is incomplete. Some pre-breeding staging areas for geese in Svalbard have been located. South-facing, snow-free slopes in coastal regions of western Spitsbergen seem to be areas frequently used by geese before they reach their breeding localities. Post-breeding concentrations of geese have been found over most of the coastal regions of the archipelago. Most barnacle geese leave their nesting islands just after hatching and raise their goslings in coastal tundra areas rich in small lakes and lush vegetation. The largest numbers of barnacle geese during this period are found along the western coasts of Spitsbergen from Isfjorden to Sorkapp. The largest aggregations of brent geese have been recorded in coastal regions in northern and southeastern parts of the archipelago and at Sorkapp, whereas important post-breeding aggregations of pink-footed geese have been located in coastal regions in northern, central and southern parts of Spitsbergen, as well as in southeastern Svalbard. It is not known to what extent the geese fly to specific pre-migratory staging areas before they start their autumn migration from Svalbard. Recent satellite-telemetry studies indicate that such areas are used at least by parts of the populations.																			0369-5417		82-7666-154-8				1998		200					41	55																WOS:000080101300004

Shifts of demography and growth in limber pine forests of the Great Basin, USA, across 4000 yr of climate variability	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Annually dated tree-rings of 509 live and deadwood limber pine (Pinus flexilis) samples from the semi-arid Wassuk Range, Nevada, yielded a 3996-yr record extending from 1983 BC to AD 2013. Correlations of radial growth with climate were positive for water relations and negative for summer temperatures. Long-term trends of ring-width corresponded to climate variability documented from other proxies, including low growth during the Late Holocene Dry Period and Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and elevated growth during cool, wet periods of the Neoglacial and Little Ice Age. Spline fit of the data indicated that growth decrease in the last 20 years was second lowest on record, surpassed by lowest growth at 20 BCAD 150. Demographics of limber pine by aspect and elevation were not strongly related to long-term climate dynamics, except in the case of extirpations on all but north aspects at the end of the MCA. Pines occurred persistently on north aspects, where a continuous record existed to present. Elevation shifts were not obvious on any aspect, and no evidence existed for migration above current treeline. Non-climatic factors appear to interact with climate to make north slopes refugial for upland pines in semi-arid regions across four millennia.

J	JOHNSTON, TB; CARLINE, RF				JOHNSTON, TB; CARLINE, RF			EVALUATION OF 4 RAINBOW-TROUT - WARMWATER SPECIES FISHERIES IN SOUTHEASTERN OHIO	OHIO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												Four southeastern Ohio lakes that receive annual trout stockings were studied to determine the extent of available trout habitat in summer, presence or extent of overlap in habitat and diet between trout and native warmwater fishes, harvest of stocked trout, recreational benefits attributable to trout stockings and the geographic areas that benefited from this management program. The lakes had little or no trout habitat during midsummer. Trout and warmwater species occupied the same habitats, even after thermal stratification, but did not appear to eat the same prey. Very few carryover trout (stocked in previous years) were caught. Average annual return of stocked trout was 83%, 98% of the estimated harvest occurred within 7 wk after stocking. Trout did not grow significantly until after wk 7. The primary beneficiaries of the stocking program were anglers living within 32 km of the lakes. There appeared to be no economically feasible way to prolong the period of trout harvest nor to improve the trout fisheries.																			0030-0950						1982	82	4					201	211																WOS:A1982PK14700010

The Importance of Radiocarbon Dates and Tephra for Developing Chronologies of Holocene Environmental Changes from Lake Sediments, North Far East	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PACIFIC GEOLOGY												Developing continuous chronologies of paleoenvironmental change in northern areas of the Far East using C-14 can be problematic because of the low organic content in lake sediments. However, Holocene age-models can be supplemented by widespread tephra deposits reported in the Magadan region. The best documented of these tephras has been correlated to the KO tephra from southern Kamchatka dated to 7600 BP. Although a key chronostratigraphic marker, no detailed compendium of the distribution of this tephra and its associated 14C dates has been available from sites in the northern Far East. We provide such a summary. Known locally as the Elikchan tephra, lake cores indicate an ash fall that extended similar to 1800 km north of the Kamchatkan caldera with a similar to 500 km wide trajectory in the Magadan region. Other Holocene tephras preserved in lake sediments have poorer age control and possibly date to similar to 2500 BP, similar to 2700 BP and similar to 6000 BP. These ashes seem to be restricted to coastal or near-coastal sites. A single record of a similar to 25,000 BP tephra has also been documented similar to 100 km to the northeast of Magadan.

J	Jacobsen, L; Berg, S; Jepsen, N; Skov, C				Jacobsen, L; Berg, S; Jepsen, N; Skov, C			Does roach behaviour differ between shallow lakes of different environmental state?	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The diel activity levels and spatial distribution of roach Rutilus rutilus differed markedly between two shallow lakes of different environmental state. The movements of roach (12-25 cm L-T) with surgically implanted mini-radio transmitters, were monitored regularly during several 48 h tracking sessions in a clearwater and in a turbid lake. In both lakes, the roach in general were most active during dawn and dusk and least active during the night. Activity level in midsummer was lowest around noon in the clear lake and high around noon in the turbid lake. In summer, roach in the clear lake stayed passively in a restricted area of water lilies during the day and moved into the central part of the lake during the night. In the turbid lake, roach were dispersed all over the lake during the day and moved close to the shoreline at night. Predator: prey fish ratios did not differ in the two lakes, however the observed behaviour of roach in the clearwater lake may be explained by a larger predation pressure from fish and birds, both being favoured in the clear water.

J	Cooke, SL				Cooke, Sandra L.			A Comparison of Zooplankton Diel Vertical Distribution During Transparent and Turbid Conditions in a Natural Southern Appalachian Montane Lake	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												According to the transparency-regulator hypothesis (TRH), water transparency is the main driver of zooplankton diel vertical migration (DVM) because it influences ultraviolet radiation (UV) exposure and visual predation, which vary greatly over a diel period. I tested the TRH by examining zooplankton DVM and Secchi depth over 2 summers in Mountain Lake, VA, a unique natural lake where transparency and water level fluctuate substantially. Daytime mean depth and Secchi depth were positively correlated for Daphnia parvula, but this was not the case for other taxa. Zooplankton exhibited diurnal deficits (DDs; higher night densities compared to day), indicating that DVM does not account for all diel movement. DDs are sometimes attributed to light-mediated sampler avoidance or diel horizontal migration (DHM), but DDs did not increase with Secchi depth and DDs in littoral zones do not indicate DHM. Overall, these results suggest that factors other than transparency-perhaps predator densities-more strongly influence DVM in Mountain Lake.																			1092-6194	1938-5307				OCT	2019	26	4					785	806		10.1656/045.026.0409	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/045.026.0409													WOS:000502993400010

Experiments with subaerial landslides have shown that, depending on the slide characteristics, different wave types (Stokes, cnoidal or bore-like waves) are generated. Each of these wave types shows different wave height decay with increasing distance from the impact position. Furthermore, in very shallow water, the first impulse wave shows characteristic properties of a solitary wave. The nonlinear Fourier transform based on the Korteweg-deVries equation (KdV-NLFT) is a frequency-domain analysis method that decomposes shallow-water free-surface data into nonlinear cnoidal waves instead of linear sinusoidal waves. This method explicitly identifies solitons as spectral components within the given data. In this study, we apply the KdV-NLFT for the very first time to available 2D and 3D landslide-test data. The objective of the nonlinear decomposition is to identify the hidden nonlinear spectral structure of the impulse waves, including solitons. Furthermore, we analyze the determined solitons at different downstream positions from the impact point with respect to soliton propagation and modification. Finally, we draw conclusions for the prediction of the expected landslide-generated downstream solitons in the far-field.																			1793-4311	1793-7116				JUN	2018	12	2			SI				1840002	10.1142/S179343111840002X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S179343111840002X													WOS:000436164000003

A Coupled Modeling and Molecular Biology Approach to Microbial Source Tracking at Cowell Beach, Santa Cruz, CA, United States	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Consistently high levels of bacterial indicators of fecal pollution rank Cowell Beach as the most polluted beach in California. High levels of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), E. coli and enterococci, are measured throughout the summer, resulting in beach advisories with social and economic consequences. The source of FIB, however, is unknown. Speculations have been made that the wrack accumulating on the beach is a major source of FIB to the surf zone. The present study uses spatial and temporal sampling coupled with process-modeling to investigate potential FIB sources and the relative contributions of those sources. Temporal sampling showed consistently high FIB concentrations in the surf zone, sand, and wrack at Cowell Beach, and ruled out the storm drain, the river, the harbor, and the adjacent wharf as the sources of the high concentrations observed in the surf zone. Spatial sampling confirmed that the source of FIB to the beach is terrestrial rather than marine. Modeling results showed two dominant FIB sources to the surf zone: sand for enterococci and groundwater for E. coli. FIB from wrack represented a minor contribution to bacterial levels in the water. Molecular source tracking methods indicate the FIB at the beach is of human and bird origin. The microbial source tracking (MST) approach presented here provides a framework for future efforts.

Geographical information system (GIS)-computing of the glaciers' quantitative parameters allowed us to use various methods to evaluate the former equilibrium-line altitudes (ELAs) for the 10 largest glaciers. ELAs on reconstructed glaciers were calculated using four common methods: (1) the median elevation of glaciers (MEG), (2) the toe-to-headwall altitude ratio (THAR), (3) the accumulation area ratio (AAR), and (4) Gefer's method. The results suggest that the mean macroclimatic LGM "background" ELA for the area studied was about 1200 145 m above present sea level and the mean ELA depression relative to modem conditions was about I 100 m. Tentative estimates suggest that the reconstructed glaciers could have existed in a drier (about 1.5 times drier-than-present) environment if the mean summer air temperature was about 8-9 degreesC lower than present day.

Relationships Between Mercury Concentration in Young-of-the-Year Yellow Perch and Precipitation Depth, Water Level, and Temperature	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												This article identifies environmental factors that explain most of the dynamic year-to-year changes in mercury concentrations of young-of-year (YOY) yellow perch (Perca flavescens) in study reservoirs. Mercury concentrations in fish, collected each fall, were measured for 9years in four reservoirs in northeastern Minnesota. Three to 4years of data were also obtained for two natural lakes and one other reservoir. Average annual concentrations varied considerably from year to year with a mean change of 39% between consecutive years across all lakes. Those averages show a similar time trend for each lake over the years and suggest that important factors influencing mercury bioaccumulation change annually and are also experienced in common over the study region. Three factors satisfying that description are precipitation depth, water level, and average air temperature. This article reveals that all three have statistically significant correlations with observed mercury concentrations. Moreover, multiple regressions indicate that maximum water levels and average air temperatures explain most of the observed variations. Regressions employing precipitation depth and temperature are less significant.

Late Pleistocene to Early Holocene Sedimentary History of the Lake Bonneville Pilot Valley Embayment, Utah- Nevada, USA	LAKE BONNEVILLE: A SCIENTIFIC UPDATE	Developments in Earth Surface Processes											Multiple shallow-sediment cores were obtained from the Pilot Valley playa, the location of a Lake Bonneville sub-basin. Analyses of stratigraphy, ostracods, mineralogy, chemistry, total inorganic carbon, total organic carbon, and stable isotopes were performed to place these sediments into proper context with respect to the Lake Bonneville cycle. Results showed that the Pilot Valley playa contains a full sequence of Lake Bonneville deposits, in addition to sediments deposited before and after the Lake Bonneville cycle. Within the Bonneville marl is a sequence of algal-laminated mud. Five calibrated C-14 ages, ranging from 25.5 to 17.0 cal ka BP, determined from algae filaments in the laminated marl, in addition to its stratigraphic position near the base of the sequence, place it the early transgressive phase of Lake Bonneville. Oolitic sand occurring below the Bonneville marl indicates the existence of a shallow (< similar to 5 m), saline lake in the Pilot Valley embayment prior to the transgression of Lake Bonneville (similar to 32 k C-14 years). Analysis of sediments deposited during the late regressive phase of Lake Bonneville indicates the lake may have fallen to levels below the elevation of Pilot Valley prior to transgression of the Gilbert episode.																			0928-2025		978-0-444-63594-5; 978-0-444-63590-7				2016	20						184	220		10.1016/B978-0-444-63590-7.00010-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-63590-7.00010-X													WOS:000409050100012

We investigated the dynamics and causes of hypoxia using field measurements at two locations in the western basin during the late summer of 2017. Two hypoxic events (dissolved oxygen [DO] concentrations < 2 mg L-1) were recorded that were caused by upwelling of hypolimnetic water from the central basin of the lake following winds from the south and southwest. In this case, instantaneous stratification occurred when cool central basin water (i.e., 15.7 degrees C) intruded as a 2.5-m-thick layer above the bottom under the warm western basin waters (i.e., 23.9 degrees C). A third hypoxic event, which was associated with more typical thermal stratification from atmospheric warming, occurred during a calm and warm period near the end of the deployment. In this case, we observed a continuous decline in hypolimnetic DO from approximate to 8 to < 5 mg L-1, which likely declined to < 2 mg L-1 in 14 d using a one-dimensional model. Interbasin exchange flows generated instantaneous hypoxia multiple times within a year and were the dominate cause (63% of 11 cases) of hypoxia identified during August fishing trawls in the study area over the past 30 yr. Results of this work should help with the prediction and understanding of hypoxia in lakes with multiple basins, which will be informative for water quality and fisheries management.					; Jabbari, Aidin/Y-7296-2019	Ackerman, Josef/0000-0003-4550-490X; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	2019	64	5					2220	2236		10.1002/lno.11180	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11180													WOS:000485001400027

Sensitivity of a Remote Alpine System to the Stockholm and LRTAP Regulations in POP Emissions	ATMOSPHERE												Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) have been restricted and prohibited at national level for several decades now and since the 21st century at international level under the Stockholm Convention and the Convention of Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP). A high mountain lake sediment core was sampled in the Alps (Gossenkollesee) in summer 2010 and analyzed on POPs to examine whether the expected decreasing trends due to the implementation of the international Conventions could be observed. Higher POPs concentrations were observed in the sections corresponding to the period of large scale production and usage. p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDD showed maximum concentrations in the core sections corresponding to the 1970s. These concentrations decreased to more or less constant levels in the top sediments, which is in agreement with the timing of past usage and banning of this pesticide. On the other hand, PCBs and HCB peaked in 1980s and the concentrations fluctuated afterwards. These observed profiles suggest that the studied site is still under influence of primary or secondary emissions and that the regulations of the international Conventions have still not been noticed in this site.

Groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDE) also offer a wide spectrum of ecosystem services to populations; therefore, their identification and mapping, which is the focus of the present paper, is of high value to environmental policies; for example, WFD envisages protecting both water bodies and GDE. An ecosystem dependence index was applied to proceed with this task in the Azores archipelago, being estimated by adding the values of three partial variables (spring density; wetlands/lakes; river baseflow) over a 10 by 10 m(2) grid; with this methodology avoiding pitfalls due to lack of data. The results enabled the identification and mapping of five GDE, in Flores and Sao Miguel islands, supported by only three of the 28 groundwater bodies delimited in the Azores RBD. Those groundwater bodies are considered to have a good status according to the WFD requirements; thus, GDE, regardless of their typology, are not at risk of deterioration as a result of the interaction with groundwater. Nevertheless, other studies have shown that some GDE are in conflicting ecological areas and require specific management and protection measures, coupling land use and water resource planning.					; Andrade, César/O-4915-2018; Cruz, José/AHA-2232-2022; Andrade, Cesar/O-4915-2018; Coutinho, Rui/N-1883-2013	Cruz, Jose/0000-0002-6475-3824; Andrade, Cesar/0000-0002-5793-1987; Coutinho, Rui/0000-0002-4774-394X														2073-4441				APR	2022	14	7							1126	10.3390/w14071126	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14071126													WOS:000781823300001

Characteristics of sedimentary varve chronologies - A review	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We constructed a varve data base (VDB) to study the worldwide distribution of varved sediment records and the fidelity of their varve chronologies. Clusters of lakes with varved sediments exist in central North America, in the Canadian Arctic, and in northern and central Europe. Among the 108 sites included in the VDB, varved records are typically 200-500 cm long and cover a period of 1000-2000 years. Their varve chronologies are often based on counting of annual layers from fresh sediment surfaces and photographs or from epoxy embedded sediment blocks and thin sections. The VDB indicates that chronological errors associated with counting sedimentary varves fall generally between 1 and 3% but only 57% of published records are providing quantitative error estimations for their chronologies. With a careful documentation of varves and by applying radiometric dating methods to surface sediments as well as using historical events as time markers, there is the potential of having centennial-long varved records with a very precise age depth control. However, it is unrealistic to expect errors significantly below +/- 1% from several millennia long sections. We found no indication that varve chronologies would have been substantially more accurate and precise in some parts of the world than in others or statistically dependent on varve thickness or temporal extension of a varved sequence. According to the VDB, close to 90% of the published varve chronologies have been cross-checked with some independent dating methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Diffusive Convection under Rapidly Varying Conditions	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY												In most observations of diffusive convection in the ocean and in lakes, the characteristic diffusive staircases evolve over long time scales under quasi-stationary background conditions. In the Baltic Sea, however, diffusive staircases develop inside the flanks of intermittent intrusions that induce strong inverse temperature gradients over a vertical range of a few meters, varying on time scales of hours to days. Here, results are discussed from an extensive field campaign conducted in summer 2016 in the southern Baltic Sea, including temperature microstructure data from ocean gliders and an autonomous profiling platform. We find conditions favorable for diffusive instability in the vicinity of warm and cold intrusions with density ratios as small as R-p = 1.3. The staircases evolving under these conditions are characterized by a small number of steps (typically 1-4) with order 0.1-1-m thickness, temperature differences exceeding 1 K across individual diffusive interfaces, and exceptionally large diffusive heat fluxes of order 10 W m(-2). The standard heat flux parameterization of Kelley agrees within a factor of 2 with the directly observed interfacial heat fluxes, except for large fluxes at low R, which are strongly overestimated. The glider surveys reveal a surprisingly small lateral coherency of order 100 m of the staircase patterns, and a spreading of the diffusively unstable intrusions across isopycnals.

New evidence from and a for Eurasia	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We describe glaci-lacustrine sediments buried under thick tills in Folldalen, south-east Norway, a site located close to the former centre of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet. Thus, the location implies that the ice sheet had melted when the sediments were deposited. The exposed ground was occupied by arctic vegetation. The best age estimate from 20 quartz luminescence dates is 55.6 +/- 4.6 ka. Due to possible incomplete bleaching, an age in the younger part of the time range is most probable. We conclude that the Scandinavian Ice Sheet melted almost completely away early in Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3. Our review shows that the other Eurasian ice sheets also disappeared in that period. In north-western Germany, there were forests, containing warmth-demanding trees early in MIS 3, indicating a summer climate only slightly cooler than at present, thus supporting the evidence that the adjacent ice sheets had melted. The melting of the Eurasian ice sheets contributed to 50-100% of the sea-level rise from MIS 4 to MIS 3, implying that the much larger North American ice sheets did not melt much. In contrast, the Eurasian ice sheets contributed only about 30% to the sea-level drop from MIS 3 to MIS 2, meaning that the North American ice sheets during that period expanded strongly.

Myriapod divergence times differ between molecular clock and fossil evidence: U/Pb zircon ages of the earliest fossil millipede-bearing sediments and their significance	HISTORICAL BIOLOGY												Molecular clock calculations suggest a late Cambrian (similar to 500 Ma) divergence of myriapod classes.

Kerrera, with only extinct kampecarid myriapods from temporary playa lake deposits in a semi-arid intermontane basin is 425 Ma old. Ludlow, with kampecarid myriapods and the first trigonotarbid arachnids (with book lungs), from transported material in ripple troughs at the base of a semi-arid delta complex, is 420 Ma. Cowie, with the supposed earliest air-breathing millipede (with spiracles), from a temporary playa lake in an intermontane basin complex, is 414 Ma old. The more diverse land arthropod fauna of the Rhynie Chert hot spring deposit, also in an intermontane basin, is 407 Ma old. A rapid radiative evolution from simple intermontane lake margin communities through more evolved lowland communities took only about 20 Ma to reach complex forest grade communities by the Middle Devonian Givetian (about 385 million years).

It was hypothesized that such damming substantially impeded river incision into the plateau interior. Investigation on the large glacial-dammed lake at the entrance of Tsangpo gorge is critical for understanding this hypothesis. So far, the issues, such as age, lake surface elevation, and stages of this dammed lake, are still in debate. Our field survey of lacustrine deposits and loess distribution along the middle Yarlung Tsangpo River and its tributary, Nyang River, suggested that the lake surface elevation was at about 3180 m asl. The 23 quartz optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and 4 organic AMS C-14 ages all fall into the Last Glacial period (similar to 41-13 ka). The OSL and C-14 ages are in general agreement with each other where applicable. There might be only one long damming event because the ages of lacustrine deposits from 2970 to 3100 m asl are similar, and every lacustrine section is sustained for a long time. The estimated lake surface area was 1089 km(2), and the volume was similar to 170 km(3), which differ from previous estimations which suggested two-stage (about early Holocene and 1.5 ka) lakes, and the largest lake surface elevation reached 3500 m.

The vertical distribution of Thaumarchaeota in the water column of Lake Malawi inferred from core and intact polar tetraether lipids	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Several long paleoclimate records generated from Lake Malawi sediments rely on an assumption that the TEX86 paleothermometer reflects annual mean lake surface temperatures. Thaumarchaeota, the producers of the isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (iGDGT) lipids that are the basis of the TEX86 proxy, can occupy a wide range of habitats in the upper water column of lacustrine systems, so it is crucial to specifically constrain the ecology of Thaumarchaeota in Lake Malawi to properly interpret its sedimentary TEX86 record. To investigate the spatial and vertical distribution of Thaumarchaeotal iGDGT production in Lake Malawi, suspended particulate matter (SPM) was collected from the upper water column (>300 m) at three sites spanning the north, central, and south basins of the lake and analyzed for intact polar (IPL) and core (CL) iGDGT lipid abundances. Samples were collected in January during the austral summer when the lake is strongly stratified. Concentrations of the most labile IPL, hexose-phosphohexose (HPH)-crenarchaeol, were greatest just below the deep chlorophyll maximum at similar to 50 m water depth in the deeper north and central basins and similar to 30 m in the shallow south basin. Maximum CL concentrations occur below the maximum HPH-crenarchaeol concentrations and therefore possibly reflect the accumulation of recently produced IPL GDGT degradation products. If the export of CLs to the sediments is dominated by this CL pool, sedimentary TEX86 would reflect Thaumarchaeota living within the thermocline during the stratified season and therefore may have a cool bias rather than reflecting true surface water temperatures. An increase in abundances of GDGT-2, crenarchaeol isomer, and monohexose (MH)-crenarchaeol at similar to 150-200 m suggests that a secondary Thaumarchaeotal population, likely Group I.1b Thaumarchaeota, inhabits the subsurface water column near the anoxic-suboxic boundary. Total production of iGDGTs by this group appears to be much lower than the surface-dwelling Glade, but its imprint on sedimentary TEX86 is unknown. An analysis of iGDGT production in the water column throughout the annual cycle is needed to resolve the timing and magnitude of export of CLs to the sediments from these two Thaumarchaeotal populations.

J	Saylor, JR; Grizzard, NK				Saylor, JR; Grizzard, NK			The effect of surfactant monolayers on vortex rings formed from an impacting water drop	PHYSICS OF FLUIDS												The impact of a falling drop with a flat liquid surface can result in the formation of a subsurface vortex ring that penetrates a significant distance into the liquid bulk. Herein an experimental study of these vortex rings is presented for water drops striking a water surface. The effect of surfactant monolayers was investigated by measuring the vortex velocity for water surfaces that were free of surfactants, as well as surfaces covered with surfactant monolayers. A soluble and an insoluble monolayer were investigated, Triton X-100 and oleyl alcohol, respectively. Oleyl alcohol was investigated for concentrations ranging from 0 to 0.495 mug/cm(2), and Triton X-100 was investigated for concentrations ranging from 0 to 4.0 mg/L. For both surfactants the vortex velocity displayed a maximum at intermediate surfactant concentrations. In all cases the drop fluid was free of surfactants. A possible mechanism based on capillary wave damping is presented to explain these results. The relevance of this work to rain over lakes and oceans is discussed.

Structural control of englacial drainage systems in Himalayan debris-covered glaciers	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Englacial cave systems were mapped using speleological techniques in three debris-covered glaciers in the Khumbu Himal, Nepal. Detailed three-dimensional mapping of the cave systems and observations of relationships with structures in the surrounding ice show conduits formed by a mechanism directly analogous to speleogenesis in limestone karst. The highest, oldest parts of all passages developed along debris-filled crevasse traces with hydraulic conductivity in the range 10(-4) to 10(-5) m s(-1). Conduits form when these hydraulically efficient pathways bridge between areas with different hydraulic potential. They then evolve by grading (through head-ward migration of nick points and vertical incision) to local base level, often the surface of supraglacial lakes. Most supraglacial lakes on Himalayan glaciers are perched above the elevation of the terminal stream, and exist for a few years before draining through englacial conduits. As a result, near-surface drainage evolution is frequently interrupted by base-level fall, and conduits may record multiple phases of incision. Conduits commonly migrate laterally during incision, undermining higher levels of the ice and encouraging collapse. Voids can be created by fluvial processes and collapse of crevassed ice. The oft-noted resemblance of the surface morphology of debris-covered glaciers to karst landscapes thus extends to the subsurface, and karst hydrology provides a framework for understanding englacial drainage.

However, its evolution history and relationship with climate and tectonics are still elusive. Here we present detailed stratigraphic descriptions combined with total organic carbon content and weight ratio of organic carbon to total nitrogen records from fluvio-lacustrine sediments in the western Qaidam Basin to infer how the lake evolved during the late Pliocene-early Pleistocene. These data reveal a drying trend since 3.3 Ma, which we attribute to low latitude forcing and/or local tectonic activities. However, this trend was interrupted during 2.84-2.48 Ma, in which climate wetting was observed. We attribute the climate wetting during 2.84-2.48 Ma to intensified East Asian summer monsoon as is documented by the Chinese Loess Plateau records. Halite and gypsum content increased dramatically after 2.5 Ma, indicating the formation of salty lake in the western Qaidam Basin. These data improve our understanding of the detailed processes of Qaidam aridification and its potential forcing mechanisms.					; Su, Qingda/KIH-2636-2024; Heermance, Richard/JXY-5540-2024; Nie, Junsheng/E-5047-2010	Heermance, Richard/0000-0002-1417-9115; 														2296-6463				SEP 3	2021	9								736901	10.3389/feart.2021.736901	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2021.736901													WOS:000696703700001
J	Paul, AJ				Paul, Andrew J.			Environmental flows and recruitment of walleye (Sander vitreus) in the Peace-Athabasca Delta	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Age composition data from a commercial walleye (Sander vitreus) fishery in the Peace-Athabasca Delta were used to test the hypotheses that recruitment varied interannually and that recruitment was related to local hydrological conditions. Variable interannual recruitment was strongly supported over a null model of constant annual recruitment. Assuming recruitment strength was established in a walleye's first year of life, several a priori hypotheses relating recruitment to river discharge or lake levels were tested using an information-theoretic approach. The data best supported the hypothesis of a positive relationship between walleye recruitment and mean discharge in the Athabasca River during the fry rearing period (weeks 18-43). Approximately 25% of observed variability in annual recruitment could be explained by mean discharge during the fry period. However, the data could not fully rule out the alternate hypotheses that recruitment was related to mean discharge in the Athabasca River over the entire year or during winter. Several mechanisms are hypothesized to explain the positive relationship, including increased space in preferred open-water habitat or greater food production from nutrient inputs or wetted area. The observed correlation between river discharge and walleye recruitment can be used to help us understand water management planning on the Athabasca River.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				FEB	2013	70	2					307	315		10.1139/cjfas-2012-0279	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2012-0279													WOS:000316017500016

Here, we used stable isotope probing (SIP) techniques to identify the metabolically active aerobic methanotrophs in upper sediments (01 cm) from an arctic lake in northern Alaska sampled during ice-free summer conditions. The highest CH4 oxidation potential was observed in the upper sediment (01 cm depth) with 1.59 mu mol g wet weight-1 day-1 compared with the deeper sediment samples (13 cm, 35 cm and 510 cm), which exhibited CH4 oxidation potentials below 0.4 mu mol g wet weight-1 day-1. Both type I and type II methanotrophs were directly detected in the upper sediment total communities using targeted primer sets based on 16S rRNA genes. Sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and functional genes (pmoA and mxaF) in the 13C-DNA from the upper sediment indicated that type I methanotrophs, mainly Methylobacter, Methylosoma, Methylomonas and Methylovulum miyakonense, dominated the assimilation of CH4. Methylotrophs, including the genera Methylophilus and/or Methylotenera, were also abundant in the 13C-DNA. Our results show that a diverse microbial consortium acquired carbon from CH4 in the sediments of this arctic lake.					; HE, RUO/E-9165-2014; Tiedje, James/ABH-7937-2022	Wooller, Matthew/0000-0002-5065-4235; 													1462-2912	1462-2920				JUN	2012	14	6					1403	1419		10.1111/j.1462-2920.2012.02725.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2012.02725.x								22429394					WOS:000304866600005

A total of 28 definite breeding localities has been recorded in southern Africa. Breeding has occurred recently at at least 14 coastal localities between Swakopmund, Namibia, and Lake St Lucia, Natal, South Africa. Inland breeding has been recorded in recent years at Sua Pan, Botswana and Kalkfonteindam, Orange Free State, South Africa. Based on censuses conducted between 1980 and 1991, the southern African breeding population is estimated to be of the order of 500 pairs, 91% of which breed coastally and 89% breed on islands. Up to 290 pairs (58%) bred at Lake St Lucia. Seventyone per cent of the 1980-1991 breeding population falls within eight nature reserves. Conservation of the Caspian Tern in southern Africa requires protection at breeding localities, including commercial salt and soda ash extraction works, against the effects of changing water levels, human disturbance and predation. Pesticide levels of addled and abandoned eggs should be measured at selected breeding localities.																			0030-6525					SEP	1992	63	2-3					58	67		10.1080/00306525.1992.9633950	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00306525.1992.9633950													WOS:A1992KE01200002

CLIMATIC CHANGE												Recently, and perhaps most threatening, Lake Victoria water level has been receding at an alarming rate. A recent study suggested the possibility of the expanded hydroelectric power station in Uganda. However, since the lake receives 80% of its refill through direct rainfall and only 20% from the basin discharge, climatic contributions cannot be ignored, since the 80% water is directly dependant on it. It is therefore necessary to investigate climatic contribution to the declining Lake Victoria water level observed over a long period, i.e., 30 years. This contribution uses 30 years period anomalies for rainfall, river discharge and lake level changes of stations within Lake Victoria basin to analyse linear and cyclic trends of climate indicators in relation to Lake levels. Linear trend analysis using the Student's t test indicate a decreasing pattern in rainfall anomalies, with the slope being statistically similar to those of water levels at both Kisumu, Maziba and Jinja stations for the same period of time (1976-1999), thus showing a strong correlation. On the other hand, cyclic trend analysis using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) shows cyclic period of water level to coincide with those of droughts and rainfall. The strong relationship between climatic indicators of drought and rainfall on one-hand and lake levels on the other hand signifies the need to incorporate climate information in predicting, monitoring and managing lake level changes.

C and in a subsequent study the frost hardiness of 6-month-old seedlings of 190 experimental lines and 23 cultivars and ecotypes was determined at -12.degree. C. There were large differences among cultivars and lines in frost tolerance based on the pecentage of plants damaged and the percentage of leaves killed. The most frost-hardy were hte cultivars Podkowa and Undrom and ectoypes collected from Kaikoura and Nelson Lakes. There was no significant correlation between the percentage germination of cultivars at 4.degree. C and their subsequent frost hardiness. Large-leaved, erect cultivars tended to be more frost sensitive than small-leaved, prostrate cultivars. Frost-tolerant cultivars and lines tended to be acyanogenic. Selection for low winter growth did not incresase frost tolerance. However, lines derived from crosses between genotypes of cold-hardy line selected for rapid germination at 4.degree. C were more frost-hardy than lines from genotypes selected in a similar way that had been crossed with unselected Huia genotypes.

Before the 1950's, there were occasional investigations of plankton communities since 1896. We compared these data with the sedimentary record in two sediment cores. Then, the eutrophication history of Lake Constance was inferred from diatoms. The record of biogenic silica in the cores is discussed with respect to diatom biomass increase. Diatom assemblages in the sediment cores precisely reflected the pelagic diatom development for the period 1971-1992. Both sediment cores and the water samples have a high interannual variability of diatom assemblages. Below a sediment depth of 27 cm (AD 1920), more than 50% of the diatoms were partly corroded, and we limited the reconstruction of trophic state changes to the interval of 1920-1993. Oligotrophic conditions of Lake Constance were indicated by the dominance of various Cyclotella taxa from 1920 to 1940. Since 1939/1940, increasing abundance of Tabellaria fenestrata showed oligotrophic to mesotrophic conditions. Between 1953 and 1956, increasing Stephanodiscus hantzschii and disappearing Cyclotella indicated advanced eutrophication and total phosphorus values ranged between 8-10 mg m(-3) during turnover in late winter. Further eutrophication was shown by disappearing T. fenestrata and increasing S. minutulus in 1963. Maximum TP concentrations of 87 mg m(-3) occurred in 1979/80 and was accompanied by increasing abundances of Aulacoseira granulata. From 1986 to 1992, reoccurrence of Tabellaria fenestrata and Cyclotella indicate some recovery of Lake Constance. Biogenic silica and diatom abundances were similar among cores but indicate a 3-4 fold increase of diatom biomass only. This was far below the estimate of biomass increase from sedimentary pigment data (25 fold) and the estimate of phytoplankton data from the literature (70 fold).																			0921-2728					FEB	1999	21	2					171	192		10.1023/A:1008080922586	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008080922586													WOS:000080287800003
J	TREASURER, JW				TREASURER, JW			MEASUREMENT OF REGURGITATION IN FEEDING STUDIES OF PREDATORY FISHES	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Regurgiation of stomach contents in the predatory perch and pike captured in gill nets could be readily identified and occurrence measured. Stomachs following regurgitation, as opposed to true ''empty'' stomachs, were large, distended, with a thin wall and little internal ridging. The mean percentage of genuinely empty stomachs over a 22-month period in perch was 20-21% and in pike 7-10%. Regurgitation in perch was rare (< 9% stomachs), normally only partial and restricted to water temperatures > 21.degree. C: gill netting is therefore a legitimate means of sampling perch in food studies. In pike the sum of partial and complete regurgitation was important, with mean annual values in two lakes of 48 and 50%, and up to 84% in summer samples; it was related to water temperature (x) and described by the significant relationship y = 20.63 + x2.84, but was unrelated to fish length and gill net mesh size. Food studies of predatory fishes unsing gill nets as a capture method should take account of regurgitation. Further information is required on the extent of regurgitation when other sampling methods are used.

Despite recent progress in the understanding of Antarctic surface hydrology, potential influences on ice shelf stability as well as links to environmental drivers remain poorly constrained. In this study, we employ state-of-the-art machine learning on Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to provide new insight into the inter-annual and intra-annual evolution of surface hydrological features across six major Antarctic Peninsula and East Antarctic ice shelves. For the first time, we produce a high-resolution record of supraglacial lake extent dynamics for the period 2015-2021 at unprecedented 10m spatial resolution and bi-weekly temporal scale. Through synergetic use of optical and SAR data, we obtain a more complete mapping record also enabling the delineation of buried lakes. Our results for Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves reveal below-average meltwater ponding during most of melting seasons 2015-2018 and above-average meltwater ponding throughout summer 2019-2020 and early 2020-2021 considering years 2015-2021 as a reference period. Meltwater ponding on investigated East Antarctic ice shelves was far more variable, with above-average lake extents during most 2016-2019 melting seasons and below-average lake extents during 2020-2021, considering the reference interval 2016-2021. This study is the first to investigate relationships with climate drivers both spatially and temporally including time lag analysis. The results indicate that supraglacial lake formation in 2015-2021 is coupled to the complex interplay of local, regional and large-scale environmental drivers with similar driving factors over both ice sheet regions. In particular, varying air temperature, solar radiation and wind conditions influenced supraglacial lake formation over all six ice shelves despite strong local to regional discrepancies, as revealed through pixel-based correlation analysis. Furthermore, regional climatic conditions were shown to be influenced by Southern Hemisphere atmospheric modes showing large-scale impacts on the spatio-temporal evolution of supraglacial lakes as well as on above- or below-average meltwater ponding with respect to the period 2015-2021. Finally, the local glaciological setting, including melt-albedo feedbacks and the firn air content, was revealed to strongly influence supraglacial lake distribution. Recent increases in Antarctic Peninsula surface ponding point towards a further reduction in the firn air content, implying an increased risk for ponding and hydrofracture. In addition, lateral meltwater transport was observed over both Antarctic regions with similar implications for future ice shelf stability.

Threespine demonstrated great plasticity, with some morphological differences observed between stream catchments, mainly in ventral spine and dorsal spine length, pre-anus and preanal distances, fin depth, and ventral body width (represented in the basipterygium medial plate width). Developmentally, three groups of mensural characters were found: 18 characters best explained by a linear regression (isometric growth), 9 characters best explained by a quadratic equation (gradual allometry), and 8 characters best explained by a split-linear regression (mainly isometric growth, with an abrupt shift in proportional growth between 40 and 58 mm SL). However, these shifts did not appear associated with common ecological, physiological and/or behavioural functions. Compared with ninespine stickleback, threespine has a more robust body with stronger and more prominent spines, shorter tail, and eyes situated more backwards. Functional morphological indices suggest threespine to be a slower but more manoeuvrable swimmer than ninespine, which acquires a relatively more cruiser-form shape with reduced drag and more lift.

This water body is being constructed 15 years ago for water supply of the Tirana, capital city of Albania. The physical and chemical quality of water in this reservoir was determined and compared against universally accepted water quality standards. Water quality parameters relevant to the study area are discussed considering the ecosystem function and interrelationship among physical and chemical parameters with the biological ones. The water quality of traditional and modern reservoir was not significantly different except for a bed odour that occurs throughout of the summer. Due to the reservoirs life the eutrophication in the nowadays is not a major problem in the reservoir, but due to an intensive sedimentation rate it is predicted that will seriously affect the water body in the near future. Management strategies to improve the water use efficiency with particular reference to eutrophication are proposed. On the other hand it is recommended that an integrated approach following the IRBM criteria will be the best way of management and administration.

The emergence of an extant cichlid fish radiation from this (palaeo-) lake during the Middle Pleistocene indicates an ancient lake character. The early history of the system remains speculative, but it is established that lake extensions matching modern Lake Victoria in size have occurred during the Late Pleistocene. It has been assumed that the hydrographical dynamics chiefly depended on the inflow from the Okavango River and thus on ITCZ-controlled precipitation. Our studies, which focused the hydromorphological and palaeolimnological development of the Makgadikgadi Basin during the last 50 ka, suggest that from c. 46-16 ka it did not receive water from the Okavango River but from palaeo-rivers located in the northern and south-western catchment. A northward shift of the winter rainfall zone during the Last Glacial Maximum sustained a high lake level for a period of c. 6 ka. During Heinrich Event 1 (17-16 ka) the lake probably desiccated abruptly and completely. Higher lake levels, controlled by water from the Okavango river system, were reached again during the Holocene before the lake dried up in the middle of the last millennium.

J	Mori, T; Notsu, K				Mori, Toshiya; Notsu, Kenji			Temporal variation in chemical composition of the volcanic plume from Aso volcano, Japan, measured by remote FT-IR spectroscopy	GEOCHEMICAL JOURNAL												Remote measurements of chemical compositions of the Aso volcanic plume using an FT-IR spectral radiometer were carried out at the 1st crater of Mt. Nakadake, Aso volcano, Japan, for six times from 1996 to 2003. We have succeeded in detecting 6 volcanic gas species (SO2, HCl, HF, CO, CO2, COS) using the InSb detector. The equilibrium temperatures estimated from observed CO/CO2 ratios have remained high at more than 700 degrees C during the observation period. However, the temporal variation of the ratios between volcanic gas components showed significant scrubbing of HCl compared to other species by hydrothermal interaction in 1998. From the visual and FT-IR observations, we presume that SO2 flux from the volcano was lower in 1998 than in other years. This decrease in flux was not due to hydrothermal scrubbing of SO2 but was due to decrease in a total supply rate of gas from depth. This assumption is supported by relatively stable CO2/SO2 ratio which is probably reflecting stable gas chemistry at the gas source.

J	Schneider, J; Grosse, G; Wagner, D				Schneider, Julia; Grosse, Guido; Wagner, Dirk			Land cover classification of tundra environments in the Arctic Lena Delta based on Landsat 7 ETM+ data and its application for upscaling of methane emissions	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The Lena River Delta, situated in Northern Siberia (72.0-73.8 degrees N, 122.0-129.5 degrees E), is the largest Arctic delta and covers 29,000 km(2). Since natural deltas are characterised by complex geomorphological patterns and various types of ecosystems, high spatial resolution information on the distribution and extent of the delta environments is necessary for a spatial assessment and accurate quantification of biogeochemical processes as drivers for the emission of greenhouse gases from tundra soils. In this study, the first land cover classification for the entire Lena Delta based on Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) images was conducted and used for the quantification of methane emissions from the delta ecosystems on the regional scale. Nine land cover classes of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in the wetland dominated (72%) Lena Delta could be defined by this classification approach. The mean daily methane emission of the entire Lena Delta was calculated with 10.35 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1). Taking our multi-scale approach into account we find that the methane source strength of certain tundra wetland types is lower than calculated previously on coarser scales. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

As a consequence, there is an urgent need to implement effective conservation and habitat restoration measures in agricultural landscapes. Over the last 40-50 years, due to the cessation of traditional management practices, the majority of UK farmland ponds have become highly terres-trialised, resulting in major reductions in the diversity and abundance of aquatic plant and invertebrate assemblages. Recent research undertaken at farmland ponds in early summer, has shown restored open-canopy, macrophyte-dominated ponds support an increased abundance and diversity of farmland birds, compared to non-managed, overgrown ponds. Here, we expand on this previous research with a year-long field study to assess the implications of pond management for farmland birds by comparing bird diversity, abundance and activity at managed open-canopy ponds with those at unmanaged overgrown ponds. Driven strongly by pond management and connectivity to semi-natural landscape features such as hedgerows and woodland patches, bird abundance and species richness, as well as foraging and parental behaviour, were all significantly higher at managed open-canopy ponds. Further, a wider landscape analysis found that terrestrial land-use patterns in the vicinity of the ponds were not significant predictors of bird communities at the pond sites. In light of the numerous potential benefits to conservation-listed birds and other wildlife, we conclude that farmland pond management has been undervalued as a conservation measure to assist farmland birds. Consequently, we conclude that future agri-environment schemes, should more fully embrace farmland ponds.					; Axmacher, Jan/C-4412-2008; Axmacher, Jan Christoph/C-4412-2008	Lewis-Phillips, Jonathan/0000-0002-3070-8531; Axmacher, Jan Christoph/0000-0003-1406-928X													0167-8809	1873-2305				MAR 1	2019	273						130	140		10.1016/j.agee.2018.12.015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2018.12.015													WOS:000468248000013
J	KELLER, W; PITBLADO, JR				KELLER, W; PITBLADO, JR			CRUSTACEAN PLANKTON IN NORTHEASTERN ONTARIO LAKES SUBJECTED TO ACIDIC DEPOSITION	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												During the summer of 1981, crustacean plankton was sampled in 249 northeastern Ontario lakes, including a large proportion of acidic lakes. Species cluster analysis showed that a major species group containing Bosmina longirostris,Diaptomus minutus, Holopedium gibberum and Mesocyclops edax was common to most lakes. Two spp. subgroups most associated with more productive waters (Daphnia retrocurva, Diaptomus oregonensis, Tropocyclops prasinus mexicanus and Diaphanosoma sp.) and less productive waters (Daphnia longiremis, Cyclops scutifer, Daphnia galeata mendotae, Cyclops bicuspidatus thomasi, Eubosmina longispina and Epischura lacustris) in the study area were identified. Acidic lakes were characterized by reduced numbers of species related to declines in the importance of cyclopoids, Daphnidae, Leptodora kindtii and E. lacustris and high relative abundance of D. minutus. Stepwise multiple linear regression of physicochemical lake characteristics against percent composition of individual species failed to explain much of the variation in species proportions. Variables related to lake thermal structure were most frequently the primary correlates with species proportions in near-neutral lakes while in acidic lakes the best statistical predictors of species percent composition were most often variables directly related to lake acidity.

C.			Balance of carbon species combined with stable isotope ratios show critical switch towards bicarbonate uptake during cyanobacteria blooms	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Next to water quality deterioration, cyanobacteria blooms can affect turnover of aqueous carbon, including dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and particulate organic carbon (POC). We investigated interactions of these three phases and their stable isotopes in a freshwater pond with periodic cyanobacterial blooms over a period of 23 months. This helped to map turnover and sources of aqueous carbon before, during, and after bloom events. During bloom events POC isotope values (delta C-13(POC)) increased up to -17.4 parts per thousand, after aqueous CO2 (CO2(aq)) . fell below an atmospheric equilibration value of 412 mu atm. Additionally, carbon isotope enrichment between CO(2(aq) )and POC (epsilon(CO2-phyto)) ranged from 2.0 to 21.5%o with lowest fractionations observed at pH values above 8.9. The increase of delta C-13(POC) and decrease of epsilon(CO2-phyto) values at low pCO(2) and high pH was most likely caused by the activation of the carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM). This mechanism correlated with prevalent assimilation of C-13-enriched HCO3-. Surprisingly, CO2(aq) still contributed more than 50% to the POC pool down to pCO(2) values of around 150 mu atm. Only after this threshold the reduced epsilon(CO2-phyto) suggested incorporation of C-13-enriched HCO3-. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Sediment was collected in July at 15 m depth in a non-tidal, stratified bay in SE Kattegat. To test whether the higher content of inorganic nutrients below the halocline, compared with surface waters, could stimulate microphytobenthic growth, 2 levels of nutrient concentrations were used. Diel variations were found in L/D cores, but not in darkened cores, for oxygen, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus content in the water overlying the sediment. The flux of NH4+, NO3- and PO4(3-) out of the sediment decreased during light periods and occasionally a net uptake was recorded. Light-induced O2 production, and correlations between DELTA-fluxes (differences between day and night fluxes of O2 and nutrients), chlorophyll a content and algal cell numbers in the sediment, indicate that the decreased outflux of IN and PO4(3-) was mediated by photosynthetic organisms. Diel variations were not studied for silicon, but a significantly lower outflux, or even an uptake, of Si(OH)4 from L/D cores supports this conclusion. This suggests that diatoms play a major role in the nutrient flux between sediment and water. Also, the differences in pore-water nutrient gradients between L/D and dark cores point to the importance of sediment-associated organisms. Daily (24 h) net fluxes of nutrients were primarily out of the sediment, but the magnitude depended on both light conditions and sediment type. Daily net outflux was significantly lower in L/D cores than in darkened cores for all nutrients except NO3- in muddy cores and NO2- in sandy cores. Net uptake in L/D cores was recorded for Si(OH)4 and NO3- in sandy sediment. Outflux of nutrients was significantly higher from muddy sediments in comparison with sandy sediments (except NO3-), especially in permanent darkness. No significant effect of nutrient enrichment on the abundance of sublittoral benthic microalgae could be shown. Results suggest that microphytobenthos can influence sediment-water exchange of inorganic nutrients even at sublittoral depths, and when measuring nutrient flux in permanently darkened cores from depths around 15 m in the Kattegat, summer flux rates will be overestimated by a factor varying between 2 and 6, depending on sediment type.																			0171-8630					AUG	1991	74	2-3					263	279		10.3354/meps074263	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps074263													WOS:A1991GC13900014
J	Laudon, H; Sponseller, RA; Bishop, K				Laudon, Hjalmar; Sponseller, Ryan A.; Bishop, Kevin			From legacy effects of acid deposition in boreal streams to future environmental threats	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Few environmental issues have resulted in such a heated policy-science controversy in Sweden as the 1990s acidification debate in the north of the country. The belief that exceptionally high stream acidity levels during hydrological events was caused by anthropogenic deposition resulted in a governmentally funded, multi-million dollar surface-water liming program. This program was heavily criticized by a large part of the scientific community arguing that the acidity of northern streams was primarily caused by naturally occurring organic acids. Here, we revisit the acid deposition legacy in northern Sweden two decades after the culmination of the controversy by examining the long-term water chemistry trends in the Svartberget/Krycklan research catchment that became a nexus for the Swedish debate. In this reference stream, trends in acidic episodes do show a modest recovery that matches declines in acid deposition to pre-industrial levels, although stream acidity continues to be overwhelmingly driven by organic acidity. Yet there are legacies of acid deposition related to calcium losses from soils, which are more pronounced than anticipated. Finally, assessment of these trends are becoming increasingly complicated by new changes and threats to water resources that must be recognized to avoid unnecessary, expensive, and potentially counterproductive measures to adapt and mitigate human influences. Here we make the argument that while the acidification era is ending, climate change, land-use transitions, and long-range transport of other contaminants warrant close monitoring in the decades to come.					; Sponseller, Ryan/ABI-7338-2020; Bishop, Kevin/C-7816-2012; Laudon, Hjalmar/J-3074-2013	Bishop, Kevin/0000-0002-8057-1051; Laudon, Hjalmar/0000-0001-6058-1466													1748-9326					JAN	2021	16	1							015007	10.1088/1748-9326/abd064	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/abd064													WOS:000607950600001

Sea breezes occur about one-third of the days during the summer and play an important role in the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of NO2 and O-3 across the urban area. Mornings preceding a sea breeze are characterized by low horizontal wind speeds, low background O-3, and an accumulation of local primary emissions. Air pollution is recirculated inland during sea breezes, frequently coinciding with the highest O-3 measured at the urban center. We use "Ox" (= NO2 + O-3) to account for temporary O-3 suppression by NO and find large horizontal gradients (differences in Ox greater than 30 ppb across less than 15 km), which are not observed on otherwise westerly or easterly prevailing days. This implies a challenge in surface monitoring networks to adequately represent the spatial variability of secondary air pollution in coastal urban areas. We investigate satellite-based climatologies of tropospheric NO2, and find evidence of selection biases due to cloud conditions, but show that sea breeze days are well observed due to the fair weather conditions generally associated with these events. The fine scale of the sea breeze in Boston is not reliably represented by meteorological reanalyses products commonly used in chemical transport models required to provide inputs for the satellite-based retrievals. This implies a higher systematic error in the operational retrievals on sea breeze days compared to other days.

Environmental issues have to be dealt with over space and time. By creating links between existing aspatial long-term forest management models and geographical information systems (GIS), environmental issues can be treated within the forest management planning process. In this article, a spatial decision support system (SDSS) developed by incorporating a forest management planning model into a GIS is presented. A case study is employed to illustrate the usefulness of the SDSS using real data. In order to preserve the water bodies in a forest area, the allowable treatments in areas falling within certain distances of lakes, streams, and swamps were restricted. Treatment schedules were simulated for all stands, and linear programming was utilized to maximize the net present value (NPV) subject to a non-declining felling path. The NPV was reduced by 6.9% due to the treatment restrictions, and the annual harvest flow was reduced by about 10%. Various thematic maps of future time periods may be produced for subjective evaluation of the results.

This paper describes the development and application of a new algorithm to predict the date of ice formation on a lake. It uses a full heat budget equation to estimate surface cooling, quantifies the effect of forced convective (wind) mixing and includes the latent heat removed by ice formation. The algorithm has a fine spatial resolution near the water surface where temperature gradients before freeze-over are the greatest. Detailed field measurements of water temperatures and local weather data leading to freeze-over of Ryan Lake, Minnesota, are reported and used to verify the algorithm development. Inverse temperature stratification occurs in the near-surface water several hours before ice formation. The new algorithm is combined with a year-round temperature model and tested against observations in Ryan Lake and eight other Minnesota lakes for multiple (9-36) years. The difference between the simulated and observed permanent ice formation dates is less than 6 days for all lakes studied.																			0165-232X					MAY	1996	24	2					129	145		10.1016/0165-232X(95)00022-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0165-232X(95)00022-4													WOS:A1996UQ39200003
S	Camberlin, P		Dumont, HJ		Camberlin, Pierre			Nile Basin Climates	NILE: ORIGIN, ENVIRONMENTS, LIMNOLOGY AND HUMAN USE	Monographiae Biologicae											The climate of the Nile Basin is characterised by a strong latitudinal wetness gradient. Whereas the areas north of 18 degrees N remain dry most of the year, to the south there is a gradual increase of monsoon precipitation amounts. Rainfall regimes can be divided into nine types, among which summer peak regimes dominate. In the southern half of the basin, mesoscale circulation features and associated contrasts in local precipitation patterns develop as a result of a complex interplay involving topography, lakes and swamps. Precipitation changes and variability show up as three distinct modes of variability. Drying trends since the 1950s are found in central Sudan and to some extent the Ethiopian Highlands. The equatorial lakes region is characterised by occasional very wet years (e.g. 1961, 1997). The interannual variations are strongly, but indirectly influenced by El-Nino/Southern Oscillation. Sea surface temperature variations over other ocean basins, especially the Indian and South Atlantic Oceans, also play a significant role. Projections for the late twenty-first century show a 2-4 degrees C temperature increase over the basin, depending on the scenario, but rainfall projections are more uncertain. Most models tend to predict a rainfall increase in the equatorial regions, but there is little consistency between models over the tropical regions.																			0077-0639		978-1-4020-9725-6				2009	89						307	333				10.1007/978-1-4020-9726-3												WOS:000270040800016

Spatially Variable Increase in Rock Uplift in the Northern US Cordillera Recorded in the Distribution of River Knickpoints and Incision Depths	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Landscape evolution is driven by factors like tectonics and climate, and unraveling such factors can reveal the history recorded in landscape morphology. The northern U.S. Cordillera features many potential drivers, such as the Yellowstone plume, the extrusion of a large igneous province, and the drainage of large lakes. Among this complex geologic history, the drivers of transient incision in the Clearwater and Salmon watersheds of central Idaho are not well understood. To constrain the pattern of regional incision, we analyze the morphologies of 80 individual tributaries underlain by single lithologies. From north to south across our study area, knickpoint elevations increase from about 800 to 2,200m, and incision depths increase from about 300 to 1,200m. We use both numerical and analytical models to demonstrate that such a gradient could represent spatial variations in rock uplift. These findings suggest that transience is driven by a spatially variable increase in rock uplift that has disrupted a low-relief paleolandscape, and the high steepness values of main drainages suggest that high rock-uplift rates are still maintained to the present. Changes in rock uplift may be related to interactions between the Yellowstone plume and the lithosphere, although base level fall from the drainage of the Lake Idaho down the proto-Snake River may be superimposed over these patterns in rock uplift. We show that careful, quantitative analyses of river profiles in geologically complex regions can differentiate between the influences of rock uplift and far-field base level changes.

J	SANTUCCI, VJ; WAHL, DH				SANTUCCI, VJ; WAHL, DH			FACTORS INFLUENCING SURVIVAL AND GROWTH OF STOCKED WALLEYE (STIZOSTEDION-VITREUM) IN A CENTRARCHID-DOMINATED IMPOUNDMENT	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We compared survival and growth of fry and small (mean total length = 48-61 mm), medium (132-145 mm), and large (186-216 mm) fingerling walleye (Stizostedion vitreum) stocked for 4 yr in a centrarchid-dominated impoundment. Mean survival based on fall population estimates 1 and 2 yr after stocking indicated highest survival for large fingerlings (mean survival = 31 and 10%, respectively), followed by medium ones (7 and 4%). Few individuals from the fry and small fingerling size groups were recovered in extensive field sampling. Creel census data reinforced these findings. Thermal stress at stocking and predation by large mouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) were more important than either hooking mortality or spillway escapement in influencing survival. Walleye diets were dominated by bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) in volume (87%) and frequency of occurrence (84%). Growth rates were slower with bluegill as predominant prey compared with walleye growth in waters containing clupeids and cyprinids and may have been influenced by the abundance and size distribution of bluegill. Based on benefit/cost analysis (survival or catch/cost of rearing), stocking walleye >200 mm provided the highest return on investment.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JUL	1993	50	7					1548	1558		10.1139/f93-176	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f93-176													WOS:A1993MA27900023

Our synthesis includes 47 records from a recently published database of highly resolved Holocene paleoclimate time series from the Arctic (Sundqvist et al., 2014). We analyze the temperature histories represented by the database and compare them with paleoclimate and environmental information from 54 additional published records, mostly from datasets that did not fit the selection criteria for the Arctic Holocene database. Combined, we review evidence from a variety of proxy archives including glaciers (ice cores and glacial geomorphology), lake sediments, peat sequences, and coastal and deep-marine sediments. The temperature-sensitive records indicate more consistent and earlier Holocene warmth in the north and east, and a more diffuse and later Holocene thermal maximum in the south and west. Principal components analysis reveals two dominant Holocene trends, one with early Holocene warmth followed by cooling in the middle Holocene, the other with a broader period of warmth in the middle Holocene followed by cooling in the late Holocene. The temperature decrease from the warmest to the coolest portions of the Holocene is 3.0 +/- 1.0 degrees C on average (n = 11 sites). The Greenland Ice Sheet retracted to its minimum extent between 5 and 3 ka, consistent with many sites from around Greenland depicting a switch from warm to cool conditions around that time. The spatial pattern of temperature change through the Holocene was likely driven by the decrease in northern latitude summer insolation through the Holocene, the varied influence of waning ice sheets in the early Holocene, and the variable influx of Atlantic Water into the study region.

Large floods can swiftly drive significant nitrogen load into rivers and downstream water bodies, nevertheless, precisely quantifying NO3- sources in watersheds with complex land use patterns remains challenging. In June 2020, heavy and persistent rainfall triggered severe floods across southeastern China, causing Lake Qiandao, the largest reservoir in this region, to reach its highest recorded level. This study investigated NO3- sources and transformations within the Xin'an River-Lake Qiandao system, particularly focusing on the impact of the catastrophic summer flooding event. Through extensive sampling, we identified a distinct nitrogen concentration gradient: from the pristine Xin'an River source, characterized by 95 % forest cover and consistently low nitrogen levels for the initial 125 km, to a gradual rise as the river traversed human-impacted regions, culminating in peak concentrations within residential and agricultural areas. Isotopic analysis identified a general upward trend in nitrate stable isotope (delta N-15-NO3-) associated with the expansion of agricultural and urban lands. Mean values of delta 15N-NO3- gradually increased from headwaters and forest-dominant catchments (+2.88 parts per thousand) to agricultural regions (+6.64 parts per thousand) and residential areas (+7.10 parts per thousand). A Bayesian modeling identified that during the flood season, soil erosion and chemical fertilizers were the primary contributors, collectively accounting for 74 % of NO3- sources in the Xin'an River. However, accumulated sewage in tributaries and the overflow of sewage from treatment plants, exacerbated by the flood, significantly impacted Lake Qiandao, particularly in densely populated urban areas, contributing 53 % of the total NO3- input. Additionally, NO3- levels and isotopic values in Lake Qiandao were influenced by a mixture of sources and nitrogen cycling processes, including nitrification and algae assimilation following the flood event. In contrast, during baseflow conditions, the contribution of domestic sewage and livestock wastewaters increased to 41 % in the upper river, while Lake Qiandao remained affected by non-point source pollution, with soil erosion and chemical fertilizers contributing 58 % to the total nitrogen pollution. This study sheds light on the complex dynamics of NO3- dynamics within river-reservoir systems, particularly in the context of extreme flooding, emphasizing the critical need for comprehensive water quality management strategies along the entire watershed.					; Liu, Zhao/B-2189-2012; Qin, Boqiang/E-5900-2013; Paerl, Hans/ABE-7384-2020	paerl, hans/0000-0003-2211-1011; Zhao, Xingchen/0009-0006-9328-6766; Guangwei, Zhu/0000-0002-6718-8576; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				JUL	2024	638								131491	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131491	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131491		JUN 2024											WOS:001288453300001

ICARUS												Saturn's moon Titan has lakes and seas of liquid hydrocarbon and a dense atmosphere, an environment conducive to generating wind waves. Cassini observations thus far, however, show no indication of waves. We apply models for wind wave generation and detection to the Titan environment. Results suggest wind speed thresholds at a reference altitude of 10 m of 0.4-0.7 m/s for liquid compositions varying between pure methane and equilibrium mixtures with the atmosphere (ethane has a threshold of 0.6 m/s), varying primarily with liquid viscosity. This reduced threshold, as compared to Earth, results from Titan's increased atmosphere-to-liquid density ratio, reduced gravity and lower surface tension. General Circulation Models (GCMs) predict wind speeds below derived thresholds near equinox, when available observations of lake surfaces have been acquired. Predicted increases in winds as Titan approaches summer solstice, however, will exceed expected thresholds and may provide constraints on lake composition and/or GCM accuracy through the presence or absence of waves during the Cassini Solstice Mission. A two-scale microwave backscatter model suggests that returns from wave-modified liquid hydrocarbon surfaces may be below the pixel-scale noise floor of Cassini radar images, but can be detectable using real-aperture scatterometry, pixel binning and/or observations obtained in a specular geometry.

J	Vanucci, S; Bruni, V; Pulicanò, G				Vanucci, S; Bruni, V; Pulicanò, G			Spatial and temporal distribution of virioplankton and bacterioplankton in a Brackish Environment (Lake of Ganzirri, Italy)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Temporal and spatial changes of viral and bacterial abundance were examined in relation to environmental factors and hydrography at five stations between May 2000 and July 2001 in the brackish lake of Ganzirri (Sicily, Italy). Virioplankton abundance ranged from 5.26 x 10(4) to 7.54 x 10(8) VLP ml(-1) (on average 1.38 x 10(8) particles ml(-1)) and was significantly higher at the three eutrophic stations located in the lake of Ganzirri (Stations 1, 2, and 3) than in the channel connecting the take with the Straits of Messina. The virus-to-bacterium abundance ratio (VBR range, 0.4-117; average: 14) showed the highest values in channel connecting the lake of Ganzirri with the meromictic lake of Faro. VBR values < 1.0 were found in summer 2000 in relation with peculiar hydrographic constraints. Virioplankton distribution was dependent on salinity, and on dilution of the oligotrophic waters flowing from the Straits. Virioplankton was closely related with bacterioplankton indicating a close coupling between viruses and host cell abundance.																			0018-8158					MAY 1	2005	539						83	92		10.1007/s10750-004-3368-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-004-3368-7													WOS:000231029600008

Paleofloods records in Himalaya	GEOMORPHOLOGY												We use paleoflood deposits to reconstruct a record of past floods for the Alaknanda-Mandakini Rivers (Garhwal Himalaya), the Indus River (Ladakh, NW Himalaya) and the Brahmaputra River (NE Himalaya). The deposits are characterized by sand-silt couplets, massive sand beds, and from debris flow sediment. The chronology of paleoflood deposits, established by Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) and C-14 AMS dating techniques, indicates the following: (i) The Alaknanda-Mandakini Rivers experienced large floods during the wet and warm Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA); (ii) the Indus River experienced at least 14 large floods during the Holocene climatic optimum, when flood discharges were likely an order of magnitude higher than those of modern floods; and (iii) the Brahmaputra River experienced a megaflood between 8 and 6 ka. Magnetic susceptibility of flood sediments indicates that 10 out of 14 floods on the Indus River originated in the catchments draining the Ladakh Batholith, indicating the potential role of glacial lake outbursts (GLOFs) and/or landslide lake outbursts (LLOFs) in compounding flood magnitudes. Pollen recovered from debris flow deposits located in the headwaters of the Mandakini River showed the presence of warmth-loving trees and marshy taxa, thereby corroborating the finding that floods occurred during relatively warm periods. Collectively, our new data indicate that floods in the Himalaya largely occur during warm and wet climatic phases. Further, the evidence supports the notion that the Indian Summer Monsoon front may have penetrated into the Ladakh area during the Holocene climatic optimum. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Growth responses of the nuisance algae Gonyostomum semen (Raphidophyceae) to DOC and associated alterations of light quality and quantity	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												In recent decades, the freshwater alga Gonyostomum semen (Ehrenberg) Diesing has increased in abundance and distribution, which has created problems regarding the use of lakes for drinking water and recreation. Increases in lake dissolved organic carbon (DOC; browning) and climate warming are among current hypotheses that explain the phenomenon of increased abundance of G. semen. A replicated, multifactorial laboratory experiment was performed in order to test the effects of DOC and light quality and irradiance on growth of G. semen in 96-well plates. Each well had a separate light source, creating a gradient of irradiance (10-140 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) and wavelength (white, red, green and blue), combined with a DOC gradient (0-50 mg C l(-1)), all within representative ranges for the summer epilimnion in boreal waters. The experiment showed that growth of G. semen was significantly enhanced by the addition of DOC. No growth response relating to wavelengths was found, but where irradiance was inhibitory, a shading effect from DOC was evident. A composed response to increases in DOC suggests a versatility of G. semen that gives it a competitive advantage over other phytoplankton in humic lake ecosystems. Hence, further increases in abundance and bloom frequency of G. semen as browning continues in boreal lakes are to be expected.					de Wit, Heleen/ABO-9056-2022	Hagman, Camilla/0000-0001-8942-9329; Skjelbred, Birger/0000-0002-3338-7294													0948-3055	1616-1564					2019	82	3					241	251		10.3354/ame01894	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame01894													WOS:000487114000002
J	Cioffi, F; Gallerano, F				Cioffi, F; Gallerano, F			Management strategies for the control of eutrophication processes in Fogliano lagoon (Italy): a long-term analysis using a mathematical model	APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING												Models are developed and used to analyse and test different management strategies aimed at limiting eutrophication processes in Fogliano Lagoon: modification of lagoon hydrodynamics by tidal flow regulation, harvest of algae biomass, reclaim of sediments. Mathematical models, which have been constructed and proposed, simulate, on a multiyear time scale, the main ecological processes responsible for the most important effects of eutrophication: vegetal blooms, summer anoxia. For different management strategies, hydrodynamic fields produced by wind and tide, and three-dimensional concentration fields of significant species in the ecological phenomena, in water and into sediments, are quantified and compared. The species simulated are: in the water column dissolved oxygen, phytoplanktonic biomass, macrophytic biomass, orthophosphate, dissolved organic carbon, particulate organic carbon and hydrogen sulphide; in sediments dissolved oxygen, dissolved organic carbon, particulate organic carbon, orthophosphate, adsorbed phosphorous and hydrogen sulphide. On the basis of the results of the simulations carried out, the best management strategy limiting eutrophication processes in Fogliano lagoon has been pointed out. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

J	LICHTER, J				LICHTER, J			LAKE-MICHIGAN BEACH-RIDGE AND DUNE DEVELOPMENT, LAKE LEVEL, AND VARIABILITY IN REGIONAL WATER-BALANCE	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												A sequence of northern Lake Michigan beach ridges records lake-level fluctuations that are probably related to changes in late Holocene climate, Historically, episodes of falling and low lake level associated with regional drought led to the formation of dune-capped beach ridges, The timing of prehistoric ridge formation, estimated by radiocarbon dating of plant macrofossils from early-successional dune species, shows that return periods of inferred drought, averaged for time intervals of 100 to 480 yr, ranged between 17 and 135 yr per drought during the last 2400 yr, In five of ten of these time intervals, the average return period ranged between 17 and 22 yr per drought. These intervals of frequent ridge formation and drought were associated with the development of parabolic dunes, which is indicative of high lake level and moist climate, This seeming paradox suggests that unusually moist decades alternated with unusually dry decades during these time intervals, Regional water balance probably varied less during the time intervals when ridges formed less often and the lake produced no evidence of high level.

Ether- and Ester-Bound iso-Diabolic Acid and Other Lipids in Members of Acidobacteria Subdivision 4	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Recently, iso-diabolic acid (13,16-dimethyl octacosanedioic acid) has been identified as a major membrane-spanning lipid of subdivisions 1 and 3 of the Acidobacteria, a highly diverse phylum within the Bacteria. This finding pointed to the Acidobacteria as a potential source for the bacterial glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers that occur ubiquitously in peat, soil, lakes, and hot springs. Here, we examined the lipid composition of seven phylogenetically divergent strains of subdivision 4 of the Acidobacteria, a bacterial group that is commonly encountered in soil. Acid hydrolysis of total cell material released iso-diabolic acid derivatives in substantial quantities (11 to 48% of all fatty acids). In contrast to subdivisions 1 and 3 of the Acidobacteria, 6 out of the 7 species of subdivision 4 (excepting "Candidatus Chloracidobacterium thermophilum") contained iso-diabolic acid ether bound to a glycerol in larger fractional abundance than iso-diabolic acid itself. This is in agreement with the analysis of intact polar lipids (IPLs) by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), which showed the dominance of mixed ether-ester glycerides. iso-Diabolic acid-containing IPLs were not identified, because these IPLs are not released with a Bligh-Dyer extraction, as observed before when studying lipid compositions of subdivisions 1 and 3 of the Acidobacteria. The presence of ether bonds in the membrane lipids does not seem to be an adaptation to temperature, because the five mesophilic isolates contained a larger amount of ether lipids than the thermophile "Ca. Chloracidobacterium thermophilum." Furthermore, experiments with Pyrinomonas methylaliphatogenes did not reveal a major influence of growth temperature over the 50 to 69 degrees C range.					; Damste, Jaap/F-6128-2011; Foesel, Baerbel/ABC-6477-2021; Dunfield, Peter/C-3105-2009; Houghton, Karen/ADT-6586-2022; Sinninghe Damste, Jaap/F-6128-2011	Houghton, Karen/0000-0002-5618-6321; Dunfield, Peter/0000-0002-9319-4697; Hopmans, Ellen/0000-0002-8209-1334; Overmann, Jorg/0000-0003-3909-7201; Foesel, Baerbel/0000-0001-8872-836X; Stott, Matthew/0000-0002-2082-9460; Tank, Marcus/0000-0002-5087-6540; Sinninghe Damste, Jaap/0000-0002-8683-1854													0099-2240	1098-5336				SEP	2014	80	17					5207	5218		10.1128/AEM.01066-14	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01066-14								24928878					WOS:000341486500006

Two types of experiment were conducted, small-scale exclosure experiments(1 m(2) plots) and large-scale enclosure experiments (100 m(2) plots). In both experiments, shoots of Potamogeton crispus L. were planted in densities ranging from 1 to 8 m(-2). Potamogeton pectinatus L, and Callitriche hermaphroditica L. were also present. The herbivorous waterfowl community foraging in the lake comprised mainly coot (Fulica atra L.), densities ranging from 0 to 9 individuals ha(-1), and a few mute swans (Cygnus olor Gmel.), 0.2 individuals ha(-1). During the growing season, macrophyte biomass, shoot length, shoot number per square metre and shoot height became significantly greater in exclosures/enclosures protected against grazing by waterfowl than in unprotected exclosures/enclosures. The largest differences recorded were in total shoot length and number of shoots per square metre, the maximum values found in the protected exclosures being 18.0 m and 156 m(-2), respectively, compared with 5.5 m and 53 m(-2) in the unprotected exclosures. In addition, the percentage of stubble (number of shoots lacking an apex relative to the total number of shoots) was greatest in the unprotected exclosures, with a maximum summer percentage of 25% compared with only 12% in the protected exclosures. The study provides further evidence that waterfowl may suppress macrophyte biomass in lakes with a low abundance of submerged macrophytes. We predict that by grazing on submerged macrophytes, waterfowl may have a negative impact on lake water quality, particularly in lakes that are in the recovery phase and in which macrophytes are about to re-colonise following a reduction in external nutrient loading.

To identify the dominant factors ultimately controlling fish Hg concentrations, we compiled mercury levels (Hg) during the 1976-2010 period in 90 large natural lakes in Quebec (Canada) for two major game species: northern pike (Esox lucius) and walleye (Sander vitreus). Our statistical analysis included 28 geographic information system variables and 15 climatic variables, including sulfate deposition. Higher winter temperatures explained 36 % of the variability in higher walleye growth rates, in turn accounting for 54 % of the variability in lower Hg concentrations. For northern pike, the dominance of a flat topography in the watershed explained 31 % of the variability in lower Hg concentrations. Higher mean annual temperatures explained 27 % of the variability in higher pike Hg concentrations. Pelagic versus littoral preferred habitats for walleye and pike respectively could explain the contrasted effect of temperature between the two species. Heavy logging could only explain 2 % of the increase in walleye Hg concentrations. The influence of mining on fish Hg concentrations appeared to be masked by climatic effects.

The distribution and spread of quagga mussels in perialpine lakes north of the Alps	AQUATIC INVASIONS												The dreissenids, quagga mussel Dreissena bugensis and zebra mussel D. polymorpha, are invasive freshwater mussels in Europe and North America. These species strongly impact aquatic ecosystems, such as the food web through their high abundance and filtration rate. They spread quickly within and between waterbodies, and have the ability to colonize various substrates and depths. The zebra mussel invaded and established in Swiss lakes in the 1960s, whereas the quagga mussel was not detected until 2014. We collected all available data from cantonal as well as local authorities and other institutions to describe the colonization pattern of quagga mussels in perialpine lakes north of the Alps. We also collected data regarding the distribution of larval stages of the mussels, the so-called veliger larvae. We observed that in lakes colonized by the quagga mussel, veligers are present the whole year round, whereas they are absent in winter in lakes with only zebra mussels. Additionally, we present detailed information about the invasion and colonization pattern of quagga mussels in Lake Constance. Quagga mussels colonized the lakeshore within a few years (similar to 2016-2018), outcompeted zebra mussels, and have reached densities > 5000 ind.m(-2) in the littoral zone, even at 80 m densities above 1000 ind.m(-2) were found at some locations. At the end of the article, we discussed possibilities on how the spread of quagga mussels within and among northern perialpine lakes should be monitored and prevented in the future.					; Zhang, Hui/ABN-8390-2022; Koß, Michael/JTV-0468-2023; Dennis, Stuart/L-7998-2017; Hesselschwerdt, John/B-7439-2009	DeWeber, Jefferson/0000-0001-5840-8488; Zhang, Hui/0000-0002-8158-3740; Haltiner, Linda/0000-0001-7681-667X; 													1798-6540	1818-5487				JUN	2022	17	2					153	173		10.3391/ai.2022.17.2.02	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/ai.2022.17.2.02													WOS:000861951200002

We used bioenergetics model simulations, coupled with field sampling of predator diet and distribution, to quantify the intensity of cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki) predation on stocked sockeye salmon fry in Margaret Lake during 1993 and 1994. Model results indicated that, by September, cutthroat trout consumed an estimated 34-51 and 32-100% of the 200 000 and 100 000 sockeye salmon fry stocked in May 1993 and 1994, respectively. September hydroacoustic survey results estimated a 82-87% decline of fry in 1993 and 90-93% in 1994. Stomach fullness and evacuation estimates of total consumption were 59% of model estimates after the first fry release in 1994 and 120% of the model estimates after the second release. All approaches to estimating cutthroat trout predation on stocked fry suggested that piscivores played a substantial role in the decline of sockeye salmon fry in Margaret Lake. The ability to estimate consumption is valuable in isolating predator influence on food web dynamics, especially in manipulated systems.																			0706-652X					MAY	1998	55	5					1285	1295		10.1139/cjfas-55-5-1285	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-55-5-1285													WOS:000075787000024

Loch Macumber (early Carboniferous) of Atlantic Canada	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Following the Acadian Orogeny, Atlantic Canada accommodated several, large, relatively deep lakes within a wrench-fault basin complex called the Maritime Basin. Late Devonian and Tournaisian lakes were hydrologically open, shallow to deep, mainly fresh water bodies. Middle Visean lakes, here collectively called Loch Macumber, were closed, deep, and meromictic. Their deposits comprise the first and thickest of five sequences in the Maritime Basin. Salinity in the loch increased with time from restricted marine or penesaline, to saline. Basin-centre facies consist of a thin, but extensive, sheet of black, peloidal laminated lime mudstones and an overlying thick evaporite complex. The carbonate sheet grades laterally into both laminated to thinly bedded marlstones, siliciclastic sandstones, and microbial, biocementstone mounds. Laminae consist of alternating carbonate and either silty carbonaceous shale or siliciclastic clay and silt. The mudstone and marlstone are locally interbedded with siliciclastic and carbonate turbidites, resedimented (?deep water) breccias, and olistostromes. Seasonal changes in anoxia and/or carbonate production produced rhythmic laminae of carbonate and carbonaceous shale. Carbonate grains consist of silt-sized microbial clots and rare arthropod carapaces and brachiopod shells. The mounds originated as tufa precipitated around subaqueous hydrothermal springs that supported chemosynthetic communities. Resedimentation processes including incipient brecciation, sliding, slumping, debris flows, and turbidity currents were common. The mounds trapped hydrocarbons from the surrounding laminite and sulphides from underlying hydrothermal vents. Increasing salinity with time resulted in sulphate and chloride precipitation that filled the basins and ended the life of Loch Macumber. After the deposition of thick evaporites the topography became less accentuated, the seas less saline, and the faunas more normal marine.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				JAN	1994	11	2					151	172		10.1007/BF00686863	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00686863													WOS:000208333700002
J	Chen, W; Wang, WM				Chen, Wei; Wang, Wei-Ming			Middle-Late Holocene vegetation history and environment changes revealed by pollen analysis of a core at Qingdao of Shandong Province, East China	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												There is almost no detailed Holocene pollen data in Shandong Province. This paper reports a pollen record from a natural profile at Qingdao of Shandong Province, East China between 7250 and 3500 cal. BP, and provides new evidence for the collapse of Neolithic cultures around Central China in the middle Holocene. It reveals a subtropical deciduous and evergreen broad-leaved forest was well-developed during 7250-5900 cal. BP, representing the Holocene Maximum warm climate condition. During 5900-4550 cal. BP, pollen flora retained the main features of the former stage, but the contents for the major tree components in the flora decreased, implying an end of the Holocene Maximum warmth. From 4550 cal. BP to 3900 cal. BP, the percentage of AP (Arboreal Pollen) abruptly fell to the lowest value in the profile, inferring a distinct climate deterioration. During 3900-3500 cal. BP, a major recovery of AP is captured, indicating a possible climate change. The above mentioned climate changes are in good coherence with the local Neolithic Culture evolution. It is assumed that the cold climate during 4550-3900 cal. BP is possibly responsible for the collapse of the Longshan Culture in Shandong Province. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

The rapid eutrophication of Lake Winnipeg: Greening under global change	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Nuisance blooms of heterocystous Cyanobacteria in Lake Winnipeg have nearly doubled in size since the mid 1990s. The increases are the result of a recent rapid increase in loading and concentration of phosphorus. The rapid increase in phosphorus is largely the result of two factors. The first factor is the result of rapidly increased livestock production and use of synthetic fertilizer in the Red River Valley, with smaller contributions of phosphorus from the city of Winnipeg and other human development in the Red and Winnipeg river basins. The second factor is the increased frequency and intensity of spring floods in the Red River watershed in recent years, which have greatly enhanced the transfer of phosphorus from the landscape to the lake, as well as slower increases in nitrogen. Because the low ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus in the increased inputs favors nitrogen fixing species of Cyanobacteria, these nuisance forms account for most of the increase in phytoplankton. Recovery of the lake will require reducing both agricultural and major urban sources of phosphorus and, if possible, the frequency and intensity of flooding in the Red River watershed. Flooding will be increasingly difficult to control if modeled predictions for increased precipitation under climate warming materialize. Even with targeted reductions in phosphorus inputs of 50% and measures to control flooding, recovery of the lake is expected to be slow because of phosphorus recycled from sediments and the climatic sensitivity of this shallow lake and the flooding of the Red River.

J	Specziár, A; Vörös, L				Specziár, A; Vörös, L			Long-term dynamics of Lake Balaton's chironomid fauna and its dependence on the phytoplankton production	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Long-term changes in Lake Balaton's benthic chironomid communities and the primary production are described, based on previous and original studies. Lake Balaton underwent a rapid man-made eutrophication during the 1970s and 1980s, and started to recover only recently. Chironomid communities were dominated by Procladius cf. choreus, Tanypus punctipennis and Chironomus balatonicus. Abundance and dominance relationships of chironomids showed significant spatio-temporal variations. The importance of primary production in the regulation of chironomid communities is discussed. Positive correlation was found between the mean late summer chlorophyll-a concentration and the biomass of chironomids with one year delay. Biomass and production of Ch. balatonicus showed positive and that of T. punctipennis negative correlation with the primary production. However, biomass and production of P. cf. choreus seemed to be independent from the primary production. During 1997-99 chironomids assimilated 1.1-1.3% and 2.4-3.2% of the primary production in the Tihany- and Keszthely basins, respectively. The background of this large regional difference in energy transfer efficiency from the phytoplankton to chironomids is discussed.					; Specziár, András/N-5656-2019	Specziar, Andras/0000-0001-6341-636X; 													0003-9136					AUG	2001	152	1					119	142																WOS:000170559300007
J	Moravec, F; Nie, P				Moravec, Frantisek; Nie, Pin			Studies on trematodes and acanthocephalans from freshwater fishes of Hubei Province, central China, with the erection of a new genus Quadrihexaspiron gen. n. (Acanthocephala: Neoechinorhynchidae)	FOLIA PARASITOLOGICA												The present paper comprises a systematic survey of trematodes and acanthocephalans based on helminthological examinations of 64 specimens of 14 species of freshwater fishes, belonging to six families of four fish orders, mostly from localities in Hubei Province, central China, collected in the autumn of 2002. A total of 15 trematode species (in 12 families) and 5 acanthocephalan species (in four families) was recorded. Almost all parasites are briefly described and illustrated and problems concerning their morphology, taxonomy, hosts and geographical distribution are discussed. Some findings represent new host and geographical records. New acanthocephalan genus Quadrihexaspiron gen. n. (Neoechinorhynchidae) is erected to accommodate two species from China, Quadrihexaspiron spinibarbi (Yu et Wang, 1997) comb. n. (type species) and Quadrihexaspiron parabramis (Yin et Wu, 1984) comb. n., originally placed in Hexaspiron Dollfus et Golvan, 1956; Hexaspiron is recognised as a genus belonging to Quadrigyridae. The trematode species Orientocreadium elegans Besprozvannykh, Ermolenko et Deveney, 2009 is considered to be possibly identical with Orientocreadium pseudobagri Yamaguti, 1934, whereas the morphologically similar acanthocephalan species Micracanthorhynchina dakusuiensis (Harada, 1938) and Micracanthorhynchina brevelemniscus Lisitsyna, Bar & ccaron;& aacute;k, Orosov & aacute;, Fan et Oros, 2023 may prove to be conspecific with Micracanthorhynchina motomurai (Harada, 1935). A re-examination of the type specimens of Neoechinorhynchus afghanus Moravec et Amin, 1978 (Acanthocephala), a parasite of fishes in Afghanistan, revealed the presence of minute trunk spines in this species and, consequently, it is transferred to the genus Quadrigyrus Van Cleave, 1929 (Quadrigyridae) as Quadrigyrus afghanus (Moravec etAmin, 1978) comb. n.

J	Zhang, W; Shen, YP; Chen, AA; Wu, XJ				Zhang, Wei; Shen, Yongping; Chen, An'an; Wu, Xuejiao			Opportunities and Challenges Arising from Rapid Cryospheric Changes in the Southern Altai Mountains, China	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												Optimizing the functions and services provided by the mountain cryosphere will maximize its benefits and minimize the negative impacts experienced by the populations that live and work in the cryosphere-fed regions. The high sensitivity of the mountain cryosphere to climate change highlights the importance of evaluating cryospheric changes and any cascading effects if we are to achieve regional sustainable development goals (SDGs). The southern Altai Mountains (SAM), which are located in the arid to semi-arid region of central Asia, are vulnerable to ecological and environmental changes as well as to developing economic activities in northern Xinjiang, China. Furthermore, cryospheric melting in the SAM serves as a major water resource for northeastern Kazakhstan. Here, we systematically investigate historical cryospheric changes and possible trends in the SAM and also discover the opportunities and challenges on regional water resources management arising from these changes. The warming climate and increased solid precipitation have led to inconsistent trends in the mountain cryosphere. For example, mountain glaciers, seasonally frozen ground (SFG), and river ice have followed significant shrinkage trends as evidenced by the accelerated glacier melt, shallowed freezing depth of SFG, and thinned river ice with shorter durations, respectively. In contrast, snow accumulation has increased during the cold season, but the duration of snow cover has remained stable because of the earlier onset of spring melting. The consequently earlier melt has changed the timing of surface runoff and water availability. Greater interannual fluctuations in snow cover have led to more frequent transitions between snow cover hazards (snowstorm and snowmelt flooding) and snow droughts, which pose challenges to hydropower, agriculture, aquatic life, the tail-end lake environment, fisheries, and transboundary water resource management. Increasing the reservoir capacity to regulate interannual water availability and decrease the risk associated with hydrological hazards related to extreme snowmelt may be an important supplement to the regulation and supply of cryospheric functions in a warmer climate.

The characteristics, processes, regional differentiation and forcing mechanisms of the elements of the natural environment (e.g. geomorphology, climate, hydrology, soil, etc.) are the main objects of research in physical geography. China has a complex natural environment and huge regional differentiation and therefore it provides outstanding reserach opportunities in physical geography. This review summarizes the most important developments and the main contributions of research in the physical geography and human living environment in China during the past 70 years. The major topics addressed are the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and the evolution of its cryosphere, the development of fluvial systems, the acidification of the vast arid region of the Asian interior, variations in the monsoon and westerly climate systems on multiple timescales, the development of lakes and wetlands, the watershed system model, soil erosion, past human-environment interactions, biogeography, and physical geographic zonality. After briefly introducing international research developments, we review the history of research in physical geography in China, focusing on the major achievements and major academic debates, and finally we summarize the status of current research and the future prospects. We propose that in the context of the national demand for the construction of an ecological civilization, we should make full use of the research findings of physical geography, and determine the patterns and mechanisms of natural environmental processes in order to continue to promote the continued contribution of physical geography to national development strategies, and to further contribute to the theory of physical geography from a global perspective.					; wei, yang/A-3635-2010; Zaijun, Li/JVD-8191-2023; Feng, Xiaoming/C-6509-2018; Hu, Zhenbo/ABD-8064-2021; Wu, Duo/ACI-5090-2022; Huang, Wei/W-5743-2018; Fahu, Chen/B-2788-2011; ZHANG, TINGJUN/AAX-3662-2020; Chen, Jianhui/A-5340-2011; Jiang, Mingliang/GXG-4039-2022; Dong, Guanghui/C-5985-2013; Hou, Juzhi/W-5655-2018; Fu, Bojie/B-1493-2009; Liu, jianbao/X-3646-2019; wang, jie/O-8623-2015; Wang, Jie/O-8623-2015; Hou, Shugui/J-3651-2015; Li, Xin/F-7473-2011; Zheng, Jingyun/M-5789-2015; Long, Hao/AFT-1009-2022; Yin, Yunhe/GQZ-0011-2022	Dong, Guanghui/0000-0001-8005-759X; Hou, Shugui/0000-0002-0905-3542; Hou, Juzhi/0000-0002-8512-5739; wang, jie/0000-0003-4209-8125; zhang, yili/0000-0002-9474-1664; Chen, Fahu/0000-0002-8874-1035; Long, Hao/0000-0002-2767-5521; Li, Xin/0000-0003-2999-9818; 													1674-7313	1869-1897				NOV	2019	62	11			SI		1665	1701		10.1007/s11430-019-9522-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11430-019-9522-7		OCT 2019											WOS:000492372500004

The effects of an experimental freshwater cage aquaculture operation on Mysis diluviana	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												We utilized 7 years of data to determine the influence of decreased concentrations of hypolimnetic oxygen and increased densities of phytoplankton and fish on the mysid Mysis diluviana in a whole-lake experiment on the effects of cage aquaculture for rainbow trout (Oncorhyncus mykiss). Following establishment of the cage farm in 2003, densities of Mysis decreased from an annual average of 85 m(-2) (2002-2005) to 7 m(-2) in 2007-2008. This decline was strongly correlated with decreasing concentrations of hypolimnetic oxygen. Spatially, Mysis were restricted to stations overlying bottom waters with temperatures colder than 12 degrees C and oxygen concentrations > 1 mg L-1 so that Mysis occupied a progressively smaller fraction of the lake as O-2 declined in the hypolimnion. In a nearby reference lake, Mysis densities varied considerably among years (27-112 m(-2)), but never fell as low as in the experimental lake. Mysis growth rates did not vary between the reference lake and the experimental lake. Our results indicate that declines in hypolimnetic oxygen associated with nutrient enrichment can have severe impacts on populations of Mysis.

Microbial growth under humic-free conditions in a supraglacial stream system on the Cotton Glacier, Antarctica	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												During the austral summers of 2004 and 2009, we sampled a supraglacial stream on the Cotton Glacier, Antarctica. The stream dissolved organic matter (DOM) was low (44-48 mu M C) and lacked detectable humic fluorescence signatures. Analysis of the excitation emissions matrices (EEMs) indicated that amino-acid fluorophores dominated, consistent with DOM of microbial origin, with little humic-like fluorescence. In most aquatic ecosystems, humic DOM attenuates harmful UV radiation and its absence may represent an additional stressor influencing the microbial community. Nonetheless, the stream contained an active microbial assemblage with bacterial cell abundances from 2.94 x 10(4) to 4.97 x 10(5) cells ml(-1), and bacterial production ranging from 58.8 to 293.2 ng C l(-1) d(-1). Chlorophyll-a concentrations ranged from 0.3 to 0.53 mu g l(-1) indicating that algal phototrophs were the probable source of the DOM. Microbial isolates produced a rainbow of pigment colors, suggesting adaptation to stress, and were similar to those from other cryogenic systems (Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes lineages). Supraglacial streams provide an example of contemporary microbial processes on the glacier surface and a natural laboratory for studying microbial adaptation to the absence of humics.					; Cory, Rose/C-4198-2016	Foreman, Christine/0000-0003-0230-4692; MCKNIGHT, DIANE/0000-0002-4171-1533; Cory, Rose/0000-0001-9867-7084													1748-9326					JUL-SEP	2013	8	3							035022	10.1088/1748-9326/8/3/035022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/8/3/035022													WOS:000325247100067

Climate of the past millennium inferred from varved proglacial lake sediments on northeast Baffin Island, Arctic Canada	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												This study uses Pu239+240-dated varved sediments from Big Round Lake, a proglacial lake on northeast Baffin Island, Arctic Canada to generate a 1000-year-long, annual-resolution record of past climate. Varve thickness is positively correlated with July-August-September temperature measured at Clyde River, 70 km to the north of the lake (r = 0.46, p < 0.001). We therefore interpret the variability and trends in varve thickness to partially represent summer temperature. The coolest Little Ice Age temperatures occurred in this record from 1575 to 1760 AD and were approximately 1.5A degrees C cooler than today (average from 1995 to 2005 AD) and 0.2A degrees C cooler than the last millennium (average from 1000 to 2000 AD). Pre-twentieth-century warmth occurred during two intervals, 970-1150 AD and 1375-1575 AD; temperatures were approximately 1.2A degrees C cooler than today, but 0.1A degrees C warmer than the last millennium.

In addition, local geology, soil types, and topography were evaluated in detail to distinguish its influence from that of present-day land use. Despite a remarkable similarity in physical variables and stratification, the annual development of hydrochemistry and biology differed between Rappbode and Hassel pre-dam. While the Hassel pre-dam received much higher nitrogen and phosphorus inputs from the catchment, the Rappbode pre-dam received more dissolved organic carbon. The quality of dissolved organic carbon also differed between the two catchments, indicating different sources. The higher residence time of Hassel pre-dam amplified the effects of these inputs on the trophic state of both pre-dams. The phytoplankton communities in summer were dominated by diatoms in the Rappbode pre-dam and by cyanobacteria in the Hassel pre-dam. In conclusion, land use appeared to be an important driver for the observed lake characteristics. However, it was itself strongly related to soil types and topography, which on the other hand influences the residence time of water within the catchments.					; Rinke, Karsten/E-6163-2016; Wollschläger, Ute/C-2257-2012; Büttner, Olaf/C-6306-2008; Schultze, Martin/D-4985-2015; Buttner, Olaf/C-6306-2008; Koschorreck, Matthias/E-1251-2015; Wendt-Potthoff, Katrin/E-1708-2016; Friese, Kurt/E-1395-2012	Wollschlager, Ute/0000-0001-7540-1798; Rinke, Karsten/0000-0003-0864-6722; Herzsprung, Peter/0000-0001-5872-443X; Schultze, Martin/0000-0003-3526-2919; Buttner, Olaf/0000-0002-4332-5441; Koschorreck, Matthias/0000-0002-4393-3500; Boehrer, Bertram/0000-0001-6253-6634; Wendt-Potthoff, Katrin/0000-0002-7407-3312; Friese, Kurt/0000-0002-7769-0818													1434-2944	1522-2632				OCT	2014	99	5					335	349		10.1002/iroh.201301672	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.201301672													WOS:000343933600001

PROTECTING WATER QUALITY USING CONTROLLED DRAINAGE AS AN AGRICULTURAL BMP FOR POTATO PRODUCTION	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												Subsurface drainage is used for removing excess water from agricultural lands to improve productivity, although it can cause water quality problems downstream. Agricultural drainage is identified as one of the contributing factors to Lake Winnipeg's nutrient enrichment and subsequent water quality deterioration. It has been suggested that controlled drainage in the Lake Winnipeg watershed could be a potential best management practice (BMP). The objective of the study was to evaluate the flow and nutrient export through subsurface drainage by comparing free drainage with overhead irrigation (FDIR) and controlled drainage with subirrigation (CDSI) under potato crop. The experiment was carried out in southern Manitoba in a potato field with sandy loam soil using the same irrigation water source. Subsurface drainage was installed in 2009 at an average design depth of 0.9 m. Controlled drainage was accomplished by using drainage control structures at drainage outlets. Subirrigation was carried out by pumping water back through the subsurface drainage network. Drainage flow, nutrient export, and weather parameters were monitored during the growing seasons of 2010 and 2011. On average, controlled drainage reduced the flow volume by 91% in 2010 and 54% in 2011 compared to free drainage. The drainage volume from FDIR plots ranged from 13% to 53% of the rainfall received, while for CDSI plots it varied from 0% to 8%. In both years, average nitrate concentrations were lower in CDSI compared to FDIR plots. However, average phosphate concentrations were lower in 2010 and higher in 2011 under CDSI compared to FDIR. Compared to FDIR plots, average nitrate-N export from CDSI plots was reduced by 98% in 2010 and 67% in 2011. Average phosphate export was reduced by 94% in 2010; however, in 2011, it was 15% higher than FDIR. The majority of the export happened during the period dominated by heavy drainage outflow, which coincided with spring snowmelt. The nutrient export reduction by CDSI is attributed mainly to the drainage volume reduction by controlled drainage.

Sediments deposited after ca. 1972 contain increasing numbers of diatom populations associated with oligotrophic conditions, particularly Cyclotella species, which grow in the summer deep chlorophyll maximum in the Great Lakes. The nearest analogs of assemblages deposited after ca. 1986 are assemblages deposited around ca. 1900. However, the analogy is far from perfect. Many conspicuous indigenous species have not reestablished and may be extinct. Many species have increased recently that were not abundant in the Great Lakes nora prior to 1950. Several of them appear to be associated with relatively high nitrate concentrations. Most recently deposited diatom assemblages in Lake Erie are thus substantially different from any deposited during the past 200 years. The direction and timing of changes observed lead us to conclude that the most important factors forcing the changes observed are (i) institution;of effective phosphorus loading controls in the early 1970s and (ii) invasion of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in the mid-1980s.

Invasive species are often particularly successful in occupying these habitats and utilize them as beachheads for further spread. The invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus, Pallas 1814), an inherently bottom-dwelling fish, uses vertical harbor walls as habitat, enabling them to reach boats (i.e., potential translocation vectors). To evaluate the relevance of vertical habitat use for population dynamics and translocation, we exemplary investigated a population of round gobies in a harbor ecosystem. Specifically, we investigated differences in trophic niche characteristics, individual trophic specialization, phenotypic traits, and breeding frequency in wall versus bottom-dwelling round gobies. Habitat-characteristic dietary signatures indicated habitat partitioning during the breeding season. Trophic niches overlapped but were clearly distinguishable between the habitats: Walls were inhabited by 1.4 times more trophic generalists than specialists, while the bottom was inhabited by 2.1 times more trophic specialists. Breeding frequency was 24 times higher on the walls than on the bottom. After the reproductive season, we found a higher similarity in trophic ecology of gobies inhabiting the two habitats, and differences in abundance, size, and condition. These results are in line with winter migrations to deeper habitats, which are common in round gobies in lentic and marine ecosystems. Our results suggest a high potential for microgeographic adaptation to either horizontal or vertical habitat use in invasive round gobies. We demonstrated that male gobies using the walls during the breeding season are larger and heavier, suggesting that wall climbing may select for more competitive individuals. Additionally, the overall abundance of round gobies likely increases with the additional use of vertical habitat space, which may lead to higher propagule pressure. The ability to exploit anthropogenic habitats, and a higher translocation probability of competitive individuals, can contribute to the invasion success of round gobies in anthropogenically influenced aquatic systems.

J	Jury, MR; Gwazantini, ME				Jury, MR; Gwazantini, ME			Climate variability in Malawi, part 2: Sensitivity and prediction of lake levels	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Southern Africa has only a few large lakes, one of which is Lake Malawi. It forms part of the lower Zambezi catchment and the Great Rift Valley. The lake provides food, energy, transport and recreation to the local people. Inflow to the lake increases through summer (December to April) when the equatorial convection zone ties overhead. An analysis of lake levels in the period 1937-95 has been conducted and changes are related to variations in rainfall and atmospheric conditions. Interannual cycles in the time series are consistent with those found for Zambezi River streamflows, suggesting a degree of regional coherence. Years with high inflow are contrasted with mean conditions using the National Centres for Environmental Prediction reanalysis data for the period since 1958. Composite anomalies of wind fields for wet years reveal a zonal overturning circulation. Low (upper) level westerlies (easterlies) link with a sub-tropical trough in the Mozambique Channel to enhance regional convection and lake inflows. The results provide input to predictive models for Lake Malawi to plan better the management of water resources in this pan of Africa.

Previous work has shown that dissimilatory Fe(III) reduction (DIR) is the main Fe reduction pathway in this setting. Hence, the lake sediments provide a well-characterized, natural environment in which to assess the transferability of DIR-produced Fe isotope fractionations obtained in laboratory model systems. Iron redox cycling within the sediments produces isotopically light pore water Fe(II) (average delta Fe-56 = -2.1 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand) and sorbed Fe(II) (average delta Fe-56 = -1.2 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand), compared to the Fe(III) oxyhydroxide (average delta Fe-56 = +0.6 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand) and tightly solid-bound Fe(II) (average delta Fe-56 = +0.3 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand) sediment pools. The apparent isotope fractionation factor between aqueous Fe(II) and Fe(III) oxyhydroxides of -2.6 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand derived for Lake Tantare sediments falls within the range reported for experimentally determined isotopic fractionations during DIR. Our results yield the first comprehensive set of Fe isotope signatures associated with microbially driven Fe redox cycling obtained directly in sediments of an oligotrophic freshwater lake.

J	O'Connell, MF; Dempson, JB				O'Connell, MF; Dempson, JB			The biology of Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, of Gander Lake, a large, deep, oligotrophic lake in Newfoundland, Canada	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES					4th International Charr Symposium	JUN 25-JUL 01, 2000	TROIS RIVIERES, CANADA					Resident Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, are widespread throughout the island of Newfoundland. This study examines aspects of the biology and spatial and temporal distributions of the charr of Gander Lake, the third largest in Newfoundland (surface area = 11320 ha, maximum depth = 288 m, mean depth = 105.4 m). The deepest part of the lake is approximately 258 m below sea level. The lake is well oxygenated from the surface to the bottom during all seasons. Sampling was conducted with Lundgren multiple-mesh experimental gillnets and baited hooks. There appears to be two morphs present, based on colour (dark and pale) and certain meristic characteristics. Dark charr were caught mainly in benthic nets (at depths from I to 100 m inclusive) with only a few pelagic captures. Pale charr were caught only in benthic nets at depths between 20 and 100 in inclusive. The maximum depth sampled was 196 m, but there was no catch. There was a tendency for dark charr to be found in deeper, cooler water as the upper water column and inshore areas warmed during summer. There was no apparent trend in size of charr with depth sampled. Dark and pale charr both fed on benthic macroinvertebrates; sticklebacks were consumed only by dark charr and the importance of this prey item increased with size of predator. Zooplankton and surface food were not utilised by Gander Lake charr. Results of the study are compared with findings reported for other water bodies in Newfoundland and Labrador, North America, and Europe, particularly Loch Ness which has similarities in morphometry and trophic status to Gander Lake.																			0378-1909					JUN	2002	64	1-3					115	126		10.1023/A:1016001423937	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1016001423937													WOS:000177002400009
J	Fifield, LK; Morgenstern, U				Fifield, L. Keith; Morgenstern, Uwe			Silicon-32 as a tool for dating the recent past	QUATERNARY GEOCHRONOLOGY												Silicon-32, with a half-life of approximately 140 years, has the potential to fill the dating gap that lies between those chronologies based on the shorter-lived isotopes of (3)H and (210)Pb, and those based on the longer-lived (14)C. Silicon-32 is produced in the atmosphere by cosmic ray bombardment of argon, and falls out on the Earth's surface in precipitation. Silicon-32 methods may be used to date siliceous sediments and sponges, groundwater and glacier ice. Measurement of (32)Si concentrations in these archives is, however, not straightforward. Two methods are available: radioactive-decay counting of the activity of the daughter nucleus, (32)P, and accelerator mass spectrometry, but in both cases the detection of (32)Si pushes the boundaries of the technique. Even the half-life of (32)Si is not known to a precision of better than +/- 10%. In this paper, we review efforts to determine the isotope's half-life, survey the detection methods and discuss the applications of (32)Si chronology. We show that at least some of the chronometric potential of this radioisotope is close to being realised as a result of recent improvements in methods of measurement. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Millar, CI; Westfall, RD				Millar, Constance I.; Westfall, Robert D.			Rock glaciers and related periglacial landforms in the Sierra Nevada, CA, USA; inventory, distribution and climatic relationships	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					22nd Pacific Climate Workshop	MAR 26-29, 2006	Pacific Grove, CA					Rock glaciers and related periglacial rock-ice features (RIFs) are abundant yet overlooked landforms in the Sierra Nevada, California, where they occur in diverse forms. We mapped 421 RIFs from field surveys, and grouped these into six classes based on morphology and location. These categories comprise a greater range of frozen-ground features than are commonly described in rock-glacier surveys. Mapped features extended from 2225 to 3932 m (modern, mean 3333 m), occurred mostly on NNW to NNE aspects, and ranged in apparent age from modern to relict (late Pleistocene). Many of the smaller features mapped here are not readily discernible with remote (e.g., air photo) observation; field surveys remain the best approach for their detection. We interpreted the presence of outlet springs, basal lakes, suspended silt in outlet streams, and fringing phreatophytic vegetation, in addition to morphologic indications of current rock movement, as evidence for interstitial ice, either persistent or seasonal. The six classes were distinct in their geographic settings and morphologic conditions, indicating process-level differences. To assess modern climate, we intersected mapped locations with the 30 arcsec PRISM climate model. Discriminant analysis indicated significant differences among the climate means of the classes with the first three canonical vectors describing 94% of the differences among classes. Mean annual air temperatures (MAAT) for modern features ranged from 0.3 to 2.2 degrees C; mean precipitation ranged from 1346 to 1513 mm. We calculated differences between modern and Pleistocene temperatures in two ways, one based on elevation differences of modern and relict RIFs (662 in) and standard lapse rate, the other using PRISM estimates. For the first, we estimate the difference in MAAT as -3.9 degrees C (range -2.2-to 7.9 degrees C); from PRISM, the difference was -3.3 degrees C (range -1.0 to -6.1 degrees C). In that persistent snowfields and glaciers are retreating in the Sierra Nevada under warming climates, RIFs will likely become increasingly important in prolonging water storage during the warm season and providing small but distributed water reserves for biodiversity and runoff. Their presence and water contributions would benefit by further hydrologic study. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The database contained initially 31 predictive variables that were monitored in situ for nearly forty years. The strongest predictive variables were selected by three parallel approaches: single correlation (Pearson). a multivariate method (Co-inertia analyses), and a machine learning algorithm (Random Forests), followed by a Generalized Least Squares model to determine meaningful relationships with fish biomass. Models with both additive and interactive effects were constructed. The results revealed that the indicators of degraded ecological conditions (high cyanobacteria biomass and their proportion in total phytoplankton, high summer temperature, high nutrient concentration) were negatively correlated to fish biomass. Benthic macroinvertebrates and other biotic predictors (biomass of specific fish prey and predators) were also important contributors to fish biomass dynamics. Together, abiotic and biotic factors explained 40-60% of the variance of fish biomass, depending of the species. Our findings suggest that both abiotic and biotic factors control fish biomass changes in this eutrophic lake. (C) 2019 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Design: Quantitative, exploratory, single-group, post-test descriptive design incorporating qualitative survey questions. Setting: An academic medical center in the midwestern United States. Sample: 80 men (n = 44) and women (n = 36) aged 19-85 years ((X) over bar = 49) and hospitalized for cancer treatment. Methods: Participants viewed photographs via computers and then completed a five-instrument electronic survey. Main Research Variables: Fatigue, quality of life, performance status, perceptions of distraction and restoration, and content categories of photographs. Findings: Ninety-six percent of participants enjoyed looking at the study photographs. The photographs they preferred most often were lake sunset (76%), rocky river (66%), and autumn waterfall (66%). The most rejected photographs were amusement park (54%), farmer's market vegetable table (51%), and kayakers (49%). The qualitative categories selected were landscape (28%), animals (15%), people (14%), entertainment (10%), imagery (10%), water (7%), spiritual (7%), flowers (6%), and landmark (3%). Some discrepancy between the quantitative and qualitative sections may be related to participants considering water to be a landscape. Conclusions: The hypothesis that patients' preferences for a category of photographic art are affected by the psychophysical and psychological qualities of the photographs, as well as the patients' moods and characteristics, was supported. Implications for Nursing: Nurses can play an active role in helping patients deal with the challenges of long hospital stays and life-threatening diagnoses through distraction and restoration interventions such as viewing photographic images of nature. Knowledge Translation: Nurses can use photographic imagery to provide a restorative intervention during the hospital experience. Photographic art can be used as a distraction from the hospital stay and the uncertainty of a cancer diagnosis. Having patients view photographs of nature is congruent with the core nursing values of promoting health, healing, and hope.																			0190-535X	1538-0688				JUL	2013	40	4					E337	E345		10.1188/13.ONF.E337-E345	http://dx.doi.org/10.1188/13.ONF.E337-E345								23803278					WOS:000491071200005

The YK Delta contains extensive surface waters (similar to 33% cover) and significant quantities of organic carbon, much of which is stored in vulnerable permafrost. Inland aquatic ecosystems act as hot-spots for landscape CO2 and CH4 emissions and likely represent a significant component of the Arctic carbon balance, yet aquatic fluxes of CO2 and CH4 are also some of the most uncertain. We measured dissolved CH4 and CO2 concentrations (n = 364), in surface waters from different types of waterbodies during summers from 2016 to 2019. We used Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery to classify landcover types and area burned in contributing watersheds. We develop a model using machine learning to assess how waterbody properties (size, shape, and landscape properties), environmental conditions (O-2, temperature), and surface water chemistry (dissolved organic carbon composition, nutrient concentrations) help predict in situ observations of CH4 and CO2 concentrations across deltaic waterbodies. CO2 concentrations were negatively related to waterbody size and positively related to waterbody edge effects. CH4 concentrations were primarily related to organic matter quantity and composition. Waterbodies in burned watersheds appeared to be less carbon limited and had longer soil water residence times than in unburned watersheds. Our results illustrate the importance of small lakes for regional carbon emissions and demonstrate the need for a mechanistic understanding of the drivers of greenhouse gasses in small waterbodies.					; Commane, Roisin/O-3497-2019; Ludwig, Sarah/Y-7205-2019; Commane, Roisin/E-4835-2016; Mann, Paul/H-7268-2014	Powell, Margaret/0009-0008-8826-1948; Ludwig, Sarah/0000-0002-2873-479X; Commane, Roisin/0000-0003-1373-1550; Mann, Paul/0000-0002-6221-3533													0886-6236	1944-9224				APR	2022	36	4							e2021GB007146	10.1029/2021GB007146	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021GB007146													WOS:000778510100001

The stability behaviors at the endemic equilibrium are presented under different cases, which relate to the threshold value for disease breakout. The following results and available control strategies can be obtained from theoretical analyses and numerical simulations. (1) The incubation of egg hatching can postpone the out-break of Schistosomiasis. Therefore it can be used as a new method for the control of Schistosomiasis spread that prolonging the incubation of egg hatching. (2) The time delays in miracidia and cercaria can extend the disease transmission cycle. Thus lengthening the incubation periods in miracidia and cercaria can be beneficial to Schistosomiasis prevention at the beginning. (3) The maturation periods of schistosome and sporocyst could give rise to Hopf bifurcations and periodic orbits, respectively, and the basic reproductive number decreases with respect to the maturation of sporocyst. Therefore, it is a reasonable strategy to control the spread of Schistosomiasis that prolonging the maturation duration of the sporocyst in snails. The consequences obtained motivate us that we can choose the right time to do the control laws, such as in winter (when lower temperature). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, an unprecedented investigation was undertaken to obtain and evaluate data related to sedimentary organic matter, hydrocarbon content, and stable isotopes of Lake Pamvotis sediments, thus tracking the origin of organic inputs and providing a record of environmental status. The study revealed a distinct spatial distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with values between 34.7 and 1600 mu g/kg and a rather uniform pattern for n-alkanes with concentrations falling below 41.4 mu g/g. A significant contribution of an unresolved complex mixture indicated anthropogenic petroleum contamination. Further study of relevant indexes and geochemical biomarkers supported a mixed-source input of aliphatic hydrocarbons. With regard to PAHs, there was strong evidence that their dominant origin is pyrogenic. Finally, considerable excursion in delta C-13(org) was attributed to changes in dissolved inorganic carbon accompanied by increased input of effluents and recycling of organic carbon within the lake, whereas the rise in isotopic composition of nitrogen was associated with agricultural runoff and sewage input from the town of Ioannina.					; Stalikas, Constantine/AAA-9184-2021; Vreča, Polona/I-1793-2019	Vreca, Polona/0000-0002-3972-4001; 													0090-4341	1432-0703				JUL	2009	57	1					21	31		10.1007/s00244-008-9246-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-008-9246-y								18931963					WOS:000266266200003
J	GILBERT, R				GILBERT, R			ICE ON LAKE-ONTARIO AT KINGSTON	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Observations are reported of freezeup, growth, decay, and breakup of ice during a 10-year period on Lake Ontario at Kingston. The date of freezeup is related to the date on which the running mean air temperature during n days fell to 0-degrees-C where 55 less-than-or-equal-to n less-than-or-equal-to 100 for early and late freezeup respectively. The mean duration of ice cover was 71.7 days (range 18-96 days). Average mean ice thickness was 32 cm and maximum ice thickness in a given year is related to the intensity of cooling measured in degree days of freezing. Breakup normally occurs more rapidly than in smaller, completely ice-covered lakes as a result of the mechanical action of waves and currents. It is estimated that the climatic warming predicted by Global Climate Models will result in little or no ice formation on this part of Lake Ontario. The close response of ice to climatic control while filtering minor fluctuations from the record offers a tool to assess the early stages of climatic warming.																			0380-1330						1991	17	3					403	411		10.1016/S0380-1330(91)71376-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(91)71376-2													WOS:A1991GK77500012

While London still drew its drinking water from the polluted Thames River as late as 1854, the Aztecs brought potable water to Tenochtitlan from springs on the mainland by means of the aqueduct built by Nezahualcoyotl between 1466 and 1478. A second aqueduct was constructed in 1,499-1,500 by the ruler Ahuizotl when the first aqueduct became inadequate. Although the Aztecs had no citywide drainage system, and much of the wastewater ended up in the lake surrounding the city, they had a system to handle human waste by means of privies in all public places and many private dwellings from which excrement was collected in canoes. The excrement was applied as fertilizer to chinampas (floating parcels of land) or sold in the market to be used for tanning animal hides. Urine was collected in pottery vessels to be used later as a mordant for dyeing cloth. The Tenochtitlan environment was obviously healthy for its time, especially in comparison to European cities. Public and personal hygiene contributed to minimize the incidence and severity of illnesses.

Knemidokoptic mite infestation of island populations of Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus)	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												Knemidokoptic mites infest many bird species around the world and may lead to decreased survival, although relatively few studies have documented long-term effects on populations. We present 9 years of data monitoring the survival of Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) in islands of Lake Erie, Ohio, USA. Blackbirds in our study first appeared with mite infestation in 2012. Percentage of the total number of blackbirds infested with mites peaked at 7.3% in 2013 and persisted at 5-6% through the summer of 2018. We saw no differences in infestation rates based on blackbird sex or age. Unlike most other studies, in subsequent years we did recapture birds that had previously had infestations, and we detected no decline in recapture rate due to mite infestation. While that does not mean that blackbirds do not experience negative consequences of infestation, our evidence does suggest that low-level infestation may be persistent in a population without dramatic declines in survivorship.

The Selenga delta developed Fluvisols aridic, Fluvisols umbric (gleyic), Fluvisols humus, Fluvisols mollicgleyic, Fluvisols Histic-gleyic, Folic-podburs, Gray (metamorphic) and Folic-gray soils. Fertile soils of the second bottom with Chernozems and Phaeozems are used as arable lands. Agricultural lands of terraces with Gray and Folic-gray soils are used as pastures. The soils of the low floodplain are put to agricultural use. It was established that the soils in most of agricultural lands are in satisfactory agricultural condition. The upper horizons of Gray soils under forest and Chernozems under steppe in natural condition have high humus concentrations. In soils permanently used in agriculture, humus content decreases. In fallow lands, its concentrations are recovering. The reaction of the medium (pH of water) in the soils is largely neutral. Gray soil under forest is distinguished by slightly acidic reaction. It was found that the soils of the Selenga delta have mostly a light granulometric composition.

Glacial Lake Pickering: stratigraphy and chronology of a proglacial lake dammed by the North Sea Lobe of the British-Irish Ice Sheet	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												We report the first chronology, using four new optically stimulated luminescence dates, on the sedimentary record of Glacial Lake Pickering, dammed by the North Sea Lobe of the British-Irish Ice Sheet during the Dimlington Stadial (24-11 ka cal BP). Dates range from 17.6 +/- 1.0 to 15.8 +/- 0.9 ka for the sedimentation of the Sherburn Sands at East Heslerton, which were formed by multiple coalescing alluvial fans prograding into the falling water levels of the lake and fed by progressively larger volumes of debris from the Wolds. Fan formation ceased approximate to 15.8 ka, at a time when permafrost was degrading and nival-fed streams were no longer capable of supplying sediment to the fans. A further age of 10.1 +/- 0.7 ka dates the reworking of coversand into the early part of the Holocene, immediately post-dating Younger Dryas periglacial structures. A 45-m lake level dates to approximate to 17.6 ka, when the North Sea Lobe was already in retreat, having moved eastward of the Wykeham Moraine; it stood further east at the Flamborough Moraine by approximate to 17.3 ka. The highest (70m) lake level and the occupation of the Wykeham Moraine date to an earlier phase of the North Sea Lobe occupation of the Vale of Pickering.					; Clark, Chris/C-3830-2009; Duller, Geoffrey/AAR-7494-2020; Duller, Geoffrey/D-5110-2015; Medialdea, Alicia/S-1424-2019; Fabel, Derek/A-2999-2010	Eddey, Laura/0000-0002-8552-0288; Duller, Geoffrey/0000-0002-2694-4590; Medialdea, Alicia/0000-0001-5895-0736; Fabel, Derek/0000-0003-2859-3293													0267-8179	1099-1417				FEB	2017	32	2			SI		295	310		10.1002/jqs.2833	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jqs.2833													WOS:000394906600011
J	Ouellette, AJA; Handy, SM; Wilhelm, SW				Ouellette, AJA; Handy, SM; Wilhelm, SW			Toxic microcystis is widespread in Lake Erie: PCR detection of toxin genes and molecular characterization of associated cyanobacterial communities	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												During the past decade, algae blooms, which include the toxic cyanobacterium Microcystis, have reoccurred in the Laurentian Great Lakes, most commonly in the western basin of Lake Erie. Whereas the western basin is the most impacted by toxic Microcystis in Lake Erie, there has historically been little effort focused on identifying the spatial distribution of Microcystis throughout this lake. To address this lack of knowledge, we have employed a polymerase-chain-reaction-based detection of genes required for synthesis of the toxin microcystin (mcyD and mcyB), as well as 16S rDNA fragments specific to either all Microcystis or all cyanobacteria. Using a multiplex approach, we tested 21 samples from 13 field stations and found that toxigenic Microcystis were present in the western and eastern basins in the summers of 1999, 2000, and 2002 and the central basin in 1999 and 2002. This is the most extensive distribution of Microcystis reported in Lake Erie. Clone libraries (16S rDNA) of these cyanobacterial communities were generated from 7 of the 13 field stations (representing all three basins) to partially characterize this microbial community. These libraries were shown to be dominated by sequences assigned to the Synechococcus and Cyanobium phylogenetic cluster, indicating the importance of picoplankton in this large lake system.

Feldspar crystals from the tuff have an inverse isochron age of 17.23 +/- 0.18 Ma, which is interpreted to reflect its crystallisation age. The tuff shows a reversed palaeomagnetic polarity and can be correlated with chron C5Cr of the late Burdigalian (early Karpatian) and with the lowstand systems tract (LST) of the Bur 4 global 3(rd) order sea level cycle. The tephra originates from acid (rhyodacitic to dacitic) calc-alkaline arc volcanism. Our study demonstrates that the investigated volcaniclastics are significantly different from other Burdigalian (Eggenburgian, Ottnangian) and Langhian (early Badenian) tephra from the area with regard to their volcanic zircon and Rare Earth element (REE) composition. The volcanic source of the Straning tuffs might be traced back to the western Inner Carpathian volcanic arc.

However, using ostracods in this way requires knowledge of their ecology and habitat preferences, particularly because species may show different responses to different ecological conditions. I documented ecological requirements of five ostracod species and their distribution in ten similar-sized lakes and reservoirs in Bolu, Turkey. Five species (Darwinula stevensoni, Cypria ophthalmica, Cypridopsis vidua, Cyclocypris ovum, Fabaeformiscandona fabaeformis) were found from natural lakes, while no ostracods were encountered from reservoirs. A canonical correspondence analysis suggested that salinity, temperature, redox potential, and pH were the four most influential factors on the species habitat preference in these lakes. These results were also supported with unweighted pair group mean averages (UPGMA) that also showed ostracod preference for certain ecological conditions in these lakes was mostly species-specific, depending on the changes in the levels of variables. UPGMA analysis for clustering of species and environmental data revealed three main species assemblages. The first group was represented by a single species, F. fabaeformis, whose occurrence was closely related to water hardness. The second group included two species, D. stevensoni and C ophthalmica, that were found in relatively alkaline waters with moderate temperature. The third group was represented by two species, C vidua and C ovum.

Influence of landscape features on summer water temperatures in lower Michigan streams	LANDSCAPE INFLUENCES ON STREAM HABITATS AND BIOLOGICAL ASSEMBLAGES	American Fisheries Society Symposium				Symposium on Influences of Landscape on Stream Habitat and Biological Communities	AUG 25-26, 2004	Madison, WI					Relatively little information is available regarding the environmental factors influencing water temperature in streams draining low-elevation, glaciated landscapes in the upper Midwest. We used multiple regression analysis and covariance structure analysis (CSA) to identify the landscape features that influence spatial variation in mean July water temperature in 282 lower Michigan stream sites and to determine the spatial scales over which these features operate. Both modeling approaches explained from 63% to 65% of the spatial variation in stream temperatures and suggested that thermal regimes in lower Michigan are influenced by a suite of landscape factors operating at catchment and local scales. However, CSA, because it incorporated both direct and indirect effects, provided a more robust approach for identifying the relative influence of landscape features on stream temperature. Our CSA model suggested that catchment area, latitude, local groundwater inputs, local forest cover, air temperature, percent catchment agriculture, percent catchment lakes and wetlands, and percent catchment coarse-textured geology were important factors structuring spatial variation in stream temperatures. Our analysis also suggested that impacts on stream temperature from land cover/ land use changes are of similar or greater magnitude as those resulting from increases in air temperature associated with global climate warming.

Nutrient loading has two different origins: (1) internal loading due to nutrients release from sediments and (2) external loading due to nutrients entering the lake ecosystem from catchment and atmospheric deposition. A 10-day mesocosm experiment was conducted to assess the effects of two nutrient origins on algal photosynthetic capacity, biomass, and phytoplankton community composition of Lake Taihu in the Yangtze River zone. The experiment was specifically designed to mimic (1) internal loading including sediment release in both static and turbulent situations, and (2) external loading including addition of P only, N only, and co-addition of both N and P. Sediment resuspension significantly increased nutrient loading and decreased algal photosynthetic capacity. Resuspension brought benthic algae into water column, resulting in an increase of algal biomass. Nutrient addition significantly changed N:P ratios and phytoplankton community composition. Nutrient addition optimized the dominant species. N Addition favored cyanobacteria reproduction, while P addition did not benefit algal growth and chlorophytes was the dominant in summer. With N and P co-addition, both cyanobacteria and chlorophytes were dominant. Hence, a long-term nutrient management strategy for Taihu watershed should reduce the inputsof both N and P.					xu, hai/JEP-5422-2023; Deng, Jianming/F-3822-2011; Deng, Jianming/AAN-2998-2020	Deng, Jianming/0000-0003-2432-6307; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2019	829	1					167	187		10.1007/s10750-018-3830-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-018-3830-6													WOS:000456178700013

It is also an important nursery for migrant juvenile marine fish species in the False Bay area. Extensive urbanisation in the catchment, and the regulation of lake water levels, have brought about changes to the water chemistry, hydrology and biota of the system. These perturbations have compromised the fish-nursery role of the estuary and pose water quality-related health and aesthetic threats to the sustained recreational use of the lake system. Optimisation of the existing management practices should be directed towards enhancing water quality and the user-orientated roles of the lake. These include: effective stormwater and river management in the catchment to reduce bacteriological and nutrient loading; containing peak runoff flows; manipulation of the outlet channel to maximise seawater intrusion and allow access for migrant marine fish in early summer; control of the macrophyte standing stock to ensure that its vital role is unimpaired; and improved education of both users and managers.																			0378-4738					OCT	1994	20	4					289	297																WOS:A1994PP91700004

Plants collected at 2.3-m depth had significantly higher concentrations of total chlorophyll (9.9 .mu.g mg-1 leaf dry weight (LDW)) than plants from 0.2 m (6.0 .mu.g mg-1 LDW). Furthermore, the deep-water plants had a significant enrichment with chlorophyll b. The chlorophyll a:b ratios were 2.6 and 3.2 in plants from deep and shallow water, respectively. Photosynthetic characteristics, such as low light compensation points, a steep initial slope of photosynthesis vs. irradiance and low irradiance at 1/2 maximum photosynthetic rate confirmed the adaptation to low light levels by the deep water plants. The only deviation of the deep-water vs. shallow-water plants from the general features of terrestrial shade plants was the substantially higher photosynthetic rates at light saturation. Plants from both depths showed increased pigment concentrations and a lowering of the light compensation points in the early winter.																			0304-3770	1879-1522				DEC	1988	32	4					307	319		10.1016/0304-3770(88)90103-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(88)90103-9													WOS:A1988R677100001

It is confined to areas having a long-term continuity of the forest/treeless mire mosaic, that are palaeorefugia of the relict Holocene habitats. Most localities are situated in the vicinity of the open water bodies, such as lakes, ponds, mire-pools, rivers and seas; thus, they are influenced by ground water or evaporation from the water bodies. If not, their humidity is caused by rich precipitations in (sub-)oceanic regions or foothills of mountains, humid mesoclimate in wooded areas or direct cover of shrubs and trees keeping a humid microclimate. The species resists quite well to disturbances, on condition that the water balance is untouched.

J	Karlsson, J; Jansson, M; Jonsson, A				Karlsson, Jan; Jansson, Mats; Jonsson, Anders			Respiration of allochthonous organic carbon in unproductive forest lakes determined by the Keeling plot method	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We carried out short-term (2d) experiments in nine unproductive lakes in northern Sweden in order to investigate organic carbon sources supporting lake water respiration. Surface water was incubated in gas-tight bottles in the dark, and the concentration and isotopic composition (delta C-13) of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) were measured at the start and end of the incubations. Keeling plot analyses revealed that the delta C-13 of the respired carbon was between -28.4 parts per thousand and -30.6 parts per thousand. in the lakes and that the respired carbon was mainly of allochthonous organic carbon (AlloOC) origin. The respiration of AlloOC corresponded well with metabolic imbalances indicated by negative net ecosystem production (NEP) values in the lake waters. Keeling plot analysis of DIC accumulating in the hypolimnion of two lakes during summer stratification showed delta C-13 values of around -26.6 parts per thousand for excess DIC, implying that the accumulation of DIC was mainly derived from respiration of AlloOC. Our data provide direct evidence that net heterotrophy of these lakes is caused by input and respiration of AlloOC. We conclude that the Keeling plot method is a powerful technique that enables characterization and quantification of the organic carbon sources contributing to respiration in aquatic systems.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2007	52	2					603	608		10.4319/lo.2007.52.2.0603	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2007.52.2.0603													WOS:000245145200010

Nitrogen limitation, toxin synthesis potential, and toxicity of cyanobacterial populations in Lake Okeechobee and the St. Lucie River Estuary, Florida, during the 2016 state of emergency event	PLOS ONE												Lake Okeechobee, FL, USA, has been subjected to intensifying cyanobacterial blooms that can spread to the adjacent St. Lucie River and Estuary via natural and anthropogenically-induced flooding events. In July 2016, a large, toxic cyanobacterial bloom occurred in Lake Okeechobee and throughout the St. Lucie River and Estuary, leading Florida to declare a state of emergency. This study reports on measurements and nutrient amendment experiments performed in this freshwater-estuarine ecosystem (salinity 0-25 PSU) during and after the bloom. In July, all sites along the bloom exhibited dissolved inorganic nitrogen-to phosphorus ratios < 6, while Microcystis dominated (> 95%) phytoplankton inventories from the lake to the central part of the estuary. Chlorophyll a and microcystin concentrations peaked (100 and 34 mu g L-1, respectively) within Lake Okeechobee and decreased eastwards. Metagenomic analyses indicated that genes associated with the production of microcystin (mcyE) and the algal neurotoxin saxitoxin (sxtA) originated from Microcystis and multiple diazotrophic genera, respectively. There were highly significant correlations between levels of total nitrogen, microcystin, and microcystin synthesis gene abundance across all surveyed sites (p < 0.001), suggesting high levels of nitrogen supported the production of microcystin during this event. Consistent with this, experiments performed with low salinity water from the St. Lucie River during the event indicated that algal biomass was nitrogen-limited. In the fall, densities of Microcystis and concentrations of microcystin were significantly lower, green algae co-dominated with cyanobacteria, and multiple algal groups displayed nitrogen-limitation. These results indicate that monitoring and regulatory strategies in Lake Okeechobee and the St. Lucie River and Estuary should consider managing loads of nitrogen to control future algal and microcystin-producing cyanobacterial blooms.

In this study, we took Taihu Lake, a typical eutrophic lake in China, as the research object, and monitored the northern (Changzhou City) and southern (Changxing County) regions of Taihu Lake for three consecutive years (2019-2021), respectively. We also analyzed the microbial diversity in sediments, and then summarized the effects of different nutrient environments on microorganisms in the aquatic environment. The results showed that the pollution level in the northern part of Taihu Lake was higher than that in the southern region of Taihu Lake, where the pollution was mainly in summer (June-July). The pollution in the southern region of Taihu Lake is relatively stable between 2019 and 2021; the changes in the northern part of Taihu Lake are relatively significant. Microbial diversity in the study area was negatively correlated with the degree of eutrophication of water bodies; microbial abundance was positively correlated with nutrient levels. The functional difference analysis indicated that the microorganisms in the sediments of Taihu Lake in the study area were involved in the nutrient transport and transformation, and played an important role in the purification of the lake water body. This study reveals the relationship between water eutrophication and microbial diversity, and then provides a theoretical basis for the management of eutrophic lakes.

Land Cover, Land Use, and Climate Change Impacts on Endemic Cichlid Habitats in Northern Tanzania	REMOTE SENSING												Freshwater ecosystems are among the most threatened on Earth, facing environmental and anthropogenic pressures often surpassing their terrestrial counterparts. Land use and land cover change (LUCC) such as degradation and fragmentation of the terrestrial landscape negatively impacts aquatic ecosystems. Satellite imagery allows for an impartial assessment of the past to determine habitat alterations. It can also be used as a forecasting tool in the development of species conservation strategies through models based on ecological factors extracted from imagery. In this study, we analyze Landsat time sequences (1984-2015) to quantify LUCC around three freshwater ecosystems with endemic cichlids in Tanzania. In addition, we examine population growth, agricultural expansion, and climate change as stressors that impact the habitats. We found that the natural vegetation cover surrounding Lake Chala decreased from 15.5% (1984) to 3.5% (2015). At Chemka Springs, we observed a decrease from 7.4% to 3.5% over the same period. While Lake Natron had minimal LUCC, severe climate change impacts have been forecasted for the region. Subsurface water data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite observations further show a decrease in water resources for the study areas, which could be exacerbated by increased need from a growing population and an increase in agricultural land use.

Characterizing spatial and temporal variation in stable hydrogen isotopes (δ2H) between two distinct lentic freshwater food webs	AQUATIC SCIENCES												We investigated variability in delta H-2 values for two aquatic food webs involving avian consumers (lesser scaup, Aythya affinis Eyton and tree swallow, Tachycineta bicolor Vieillot) foraging from boreal lakes in the Yukon Flats (Alaska, United States) and wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region (Saskatchewan, Canada), respectively. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to decompose sources of variation in water and tissue delta H-2. We found inter-annual variation in boreal lakes delta H-2(W) influenced by surface water connectivity (e.g., open vs. closed basins) and distance to the nearest river. Prairie pothole wetland delta H-2(W) displayed intra-annual variability dictated by wetland type (e.g., semipermanent and seasonal) with a range greater than 60 parts per thousand, which incrementally increased over the summer months. Variance in invertebrate delta H-2(I) was explained by taxonomic category, but factors such as the relative distance to the nearest river (boreal model) and wetland type (prairie model) should be explored in future studies. Lesser scaup duckling feather delta H-2(F) displayed inter-annual and spatial variability with the top model explaining 86% of the overall variation, including the following fixed effects: basin type (open/closed), year, and calendar date of sampling. Similar spatial patterns with known lesser scaup prey items, such as relative site distance to the nearest river, most closely aligned with Amphipoda delta H-2(I). Variation in tree swallow nestling delta H-2(F) was attributed to sampling date with the top model explaining 38% of overall variation, while sampled prey items (e.g., Chironomidae) did not closely follow this pattern. Our findings quantify the extreme temporal and spatial delta H-2 variability in food webs fundamentally linked to seasonal evaporative effects in shallow lentic aquatic ecosystems.

We studied how colonizing newly formed glacial lakes with turbidity-induced low-visibility affects anti-predator behaviour in Icelandic threespine sticklebacks. We tested nearly 400 fish from 15 populations and four habitat types varying in visibility and colonization history in their reaction to two predator cues (mechano-visual versus olfactory) in high versus low-visibility light treatments. Fish reacted differently to the cues and were affected by lighting environment, confirming that cue modality and light levels are important for predator detection and evasion. Fish from spring-fed lakes, especially from the highlands (likely more diverged from marine fish than lowland fish), reacted fastest to mechano-visual cues and were generally most active. Highland glacial fish showed strong responses to olfactory cues and, counter to predictions from the flexible stem hypothesis, the greatest plasticity in response to light levels. This study, leveraging natural, repeated invasions of novel sensory habitats, (i) illustrates rapid changes in anti-predator behaviour that follow due to adaptation, early life experience, or both, and (ii) suggests an additional role for behavioural plasticity enabling population persistence in the face of frequent changes in environmental conditions.

Testing variations within the Tagish Lake meteorite-II: Whole-rock geochemistry of pristine samples	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												Four pristine specimens of the Tagish Lake C2 chondrite meteorite were previously determined through mineralogy, petrology, and organic chemistry to have been affected by aqueous alteration in the order (from least to most altered) TL5b < TL11h < TL11i, and TL11v as a mixture of the other specimens (Herd et al. 2011; Blinova et al. 2014). Here, we report the whole-rock data for a total of 65 elements for the same four Tagish Lake samples as determined by ICP-MS and ICP-AES (utilizing the Parr bomb digestion method on small samples, approximately 50 mg), and by INAA. Our data demonstrate that the determined aqueous alteration sequence has a positive correlation with trace elements, such as K and Br that are mobile during aqueous alteration, which appear to be controlled by an increase of phyllosilicates from least to most altered samples. Yet, the homogeneity of other elements suggests that elemental mass transfer occurred on a localized scale and aqueous alteration was isochemical for these elements, similar to other primitive carbonaceous chondrites. By plotting data from three samples (TL5b, TL11h, and TL11i) on a Zn/Mn versus Sc/Mn diagram, we also confirm that the Tagish Lake meteorite is not a simple mixture of CI and CM material.					; Herd, Christopher/IYJ-9105-2023	Herd, Christopher/0000-0001-5210-4002; 													1086-9379	1945-5100				JUN	2014	49	6					1100	1118		10.1111/maps.12303	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maps.12303													WOS:000337625200011

Little is known about the factors that regulate thiaminase activity in alewives. We sampled alewives of uniform size (60-120 mm) during the summer of 1998 from the Gulf of St. Lawrence, seven of New York's Finger Lakes, one inland lake in Ontario, and two Great Lakes to assess possible relationships among thiamine, lipid content, fish abundance, lake morphometry, lake productivity, freshwater residency, and thiaminase activity. Thiaminase activity varied significantly among the 11 locations but was unrelated to thiamine concentration, which did not vary significantly. Alewife thiaminase activity in the Finger Lakes was negatively related to lipid content and positively related to measures of lake size (e.g., area, volume, and maximum depth). Activity in the one marine stock sampled in the Gulf of St. Lawrence was comparable to the highest values observed in the 10 freshwater stocks examined. Variation in alewife thiaminase activity has the potential to affect the extent of a thiamine deficiency associated with salmonines who feed on alewives as well as the viability of their offspring.

Benthic samples were collected from reference and impaired lakes with muck and intermediate sediments in central and northern New Jersey during summer 1997. We used a stepwise process to evaluate properties of candidate metrics and selected five for the Lake Macroinvertebrate Integrity Index (LMII): Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (HBI), percent chironomid individuals, percent collector-gatherer taxa, percent oligochaetes/leeches, and number of Diptera taxa. We scored metrics as the fraction of the best expected value (based on all sites) achieved at a site and summed them into the LMII. Evaluation of the LMII showed that it discriminated well between reference and impaired lakes and was strongly related to several potential stressors. Chemical and physical gradients distinguished between reference and impaired lakes, and the LMII summarized these gradients well. The LMII corresponded strongly with land use, but some lakes with more urban land use still achieved high scores. Based on a power analysis, the ability of the LMII to detect differences in condition was sensitive to the number of samples from each lake.																			0167-6369					AUG	2002	77	3					311	333		10.1023/A:1016096925401	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1016096925401								12194418					WOS:000176413700006

Results show that the PM1.1 (aerodynamic diameter < 1.1 mu m) grew in particle size, becoming PM1.1-2.1 (1.1 mu m < aerodynamic diameter < 2.1 mu m) and then CPM (coarse particle matter; aerodynamic diameter > 2.1 mu g) due to coagulation growth and chemical reactions, prior to Meiyu. The ions, anions, and cations all exhibited bimodal distributions before Meiyu, with peak positions of 0.43-1.1 and 9-10 mu m, and trimodal distributions during Meiyu, with unfixed peak positions. The spectral size distributions of the SO42-, NO3-, and NH4+ were all bimodal or trimodal before Meiyu, and SNA (SO42-, NO3-, and NH4+) was the main component of the PM1.1 and PM1.1-2.1. Vehicle emissions were more important and the secondary formation of SO42- from SO(2 )occurred more readily during Meiyu than before Meiyu. The nitrogen oxidation ratio (NOR) was lower than the sulfur oxidation ratio (SOR), and the secondary formation of NO(3)(-)from NOx infrequently occurred in Wuxi compared to that of SO42- from SO2. The samples collected during the pre-Meiyu season and Meiyu all fell below the line 1:1 (CE:AE) (cation equivalence:anion equivalence), suggesting that the volatilization of ammonium and nitrate as well as unmeasured hydrogen ions may have caused the loss of cations, which resulted in insufficient cations for neutralizing the anions and subsequently, acidic properties for the aerosol. [NH4+ + Ca2+]are evidently sufficient for neutralizing [SO42- + NO3- + NO2- + Cl- ].

J	Wlasiuk, J				Wlasiuk, Jonathan			A Company Town on Common Waters: Standard Oil in the Calumet	ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY												In the last decade of the nineteenth century, the Standard Oil Company undertook an extraordinary experiment to build a company town in northwest Indiana's Calumet region. The history of Standard Oil on the Great Lakes shatters the dichotomy between business and government and serves as a cautionary tale of the effects of "free market" environmentalism. The company town, as envisioned by Standard Oil, represented more than just an attempt to set the terms of the company's social contract with its workers and local government: it was also an aggressive experiment in environmental engineering. Despite attempts by Christine Meisner Rosen to build bridges between environmental and business history by emphasizing an interdisciplinary "industrial ecology," often business historians fall back on "Chandlerian institutional analysis" of a "neoclassical model of the profit maximizing business manager responding in rational ways to market conditions ... that increase the efficiency of firms." For our part, environmental historians have struggled over whether we have imposed narratives of decline that reflect our cultural desires and fears more than historical reality. At stake is the political question of whether state regulation or free markets best protect ecosystems.																			1084-5453	1930-8892				OCT	2014	19	4					687	713		10.1093/envhis/emu069	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/envhis/emu069													WOS:000343322900004

Host mortality and variability in epizootics of Schistocephalus solidus infecting the threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus	PARASITOLOGY												An analysis of the metrics of Schistocephalus solidus infection of the threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, in Walby Lake, Alaska, showed that an epizootic ended between 1996 and 1998 and another occurred between 1998 and 2003. The end of the first epizootic was associated with a crash in population size of the stickleback, which serves as the second intermediate host. The likely cause of the end of that epizootic is mass mortality of host fish over winter in 1996-1997. The deleterious impact of the parasite on host reproduction and increased host predation associated with parasitic manipulation of host behaviour and morphology to facilitate transmission might also have played a role, along with unknown environmental factors acting on heavily infected fish or fish in poor condition. The second epizootic was linked to relatively high levels of prevalence and mean intensity of infection, but parasite:host mass ratios were quite low at the peak and there were no apparent mass deaths of the host. A number of abiotic and biotic factors are likely to interact to contribute to the occurrence of epizootics in S. solidus, which appear to be unstable and variable. Epizootics appear to depend on particular and, at times, rare sets of circumstances.

Such eutrophied basin is characterised by low winds, reduced discharges during the summer and by the presence of large lotus flower (Nelumbo nucifera) meadows, all contributing to water stagnation. A numerical hydrodynamic model was built to understand how physical drivers shape basic circulation dynamics, selecting appropriate methodologies for the lake. These include a 3D code to reproduce the interaction between wind and through-flowing current, a fetch-dependent wind stress model, a porous media approach for canopy flow resistance and the consideration of wave-current interaction. The model allowed to estimate the circulation modes and water residence time distributions under identified typical ordinary, storm and drought conditions, the hydrodynamic influence of the newly-opened secondary outlet of the lake, the surface wave parameters, their influence on circulations and the bottom stress they originate, and the adaptation time scales of circulations to storm events. Some probable effects of the obtained hydrodynamic characteristics of the Superior Lake of Mantua on its biochemical processes are also introduced.

J	Jin, QS; Bethke, CM				Jin, Qusheng; Bethke, Craig M.			Cellular energy conservation and the rate of microbial sulfate reduction	GEOLOGY												Microbial sulfate reduction is subject to a thermodynamic limit arising from the microorganisms' need to save energy for maintenance and growth, and this limit prevents the process from proceeding until the supply of electron donor or sulfate has been consumed, as would be expected from commonly applied kinetic theory. In pure culture experiments, acetotrophic sulfate reduction stops when the energy liberated by the reaction falls to similar to 33-43 kJ.(mol SO(4)(2-))(-1), and an overlapping range of 40-56 kJ.( mol SO(4)(2-))(-1) is observed where sulfate reduction has ceased in experiments with microbial consortia, as well as in nature, in lacustrine, marine, and aquifer sediments. These observations correspond to an energetic requirement of 33-47 kJ.( mol SO(4)(2-))(-1) calculated on the basis of the cellular physiology of sulfate reducers. In sediments underlying Lake Washington, USA, variation of pore-water chemistry with depth can be explained by a reactive transport model accounting for cellular energy conservation, whereas a model in which thermodynamics are neglected predicts an unrealistic pattern. Energy availability constitutes a primary, if commonly overlooked, control on the distribution and rate of microbial sulfate reduction in nature and helps resolve apparent contradictions observed in the laboratory and natural environment.					; Jin, Qusheng/J-8708-2012	Jin, Qusheng/0000-0002-0808-2122; 													0091-7613					NOV	2009	37	11					1027	1030		10.1130/G30185A.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/G30185A.1													WOS:000271215600017

Water quality index to determine the surface water quality of Sankey tank and Mallathahalli lake, Bangalore urban district, Karnataka, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The present work aims at assessing the water quality index (WQI) in the surface water of Sankey tank and Mallathahalli lake situated in Bangalore Urban district by monitoring three sampling locations within Sankey tank (viz., A, B and C) and Mallathahalli lake (viz., Inlet, Centre and outlet) for a period of 3 months from March to May 2012. The surface water samples were subjected to comprehensive physico-chemical analysis involving major cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, Fe2+), anions (HCO3-, Cl-, SO42-, NO3-, F-, PO43-)besides general parameters (pH, EC, TDS, alkalinity, total hardness, DO, BOD, COD, CO2, SiO2, colour, turbidity). For calculating the WQI, 14 parameters namely, pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, total hardness, alkalinity, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride, sulphate, nitrate, fluorides and iron were considered. SAR values indicated that both Sankey tank and Mallathahalli lake waters are excellent (S1) for irrigation, while electrical conductivity values classified these lake water, respectively under medium salinity (C2) and high (C3) salinity category. Correlation between SAR and electrical conductivity revealed that Sankey tank water is C2S1 (medium salinity-low sodium) type while Mallathahalli lake water is C3S1 (high salinity-low sodium) type. Sankey tank and Mallathahalli lake water were, respectively hard and very hard in nature. Further, it is apparent from WQI values that Sankey tank water belongs to good water class with WQI values ranging from 50.34 to 63.38. The Mallathahalli lake water with WQI value ranging from 111.69 to 137.09, fall under poor water category.

J	Gächter, R; Müller, B				Gächter, R; Müller, B			Why the phosphorus retention of lakes does not necessarily depend on the oxygen supply to their sediment surface	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												In order to improve the trophic state of Lake Sempach, a eutrophied lake in central Switzerland, its external phosphorus (P) load has been decreased and its hypolimnion has been artificially oxygenated to lower the lake-internal P recycling. Based on more than 15 yr of experience, we conclude that the reduction of the external P load resulted in a corresponding decrease of the lake's P concentration. However, contrary to initial expectations, increased hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen concentrations neither (1) reduced the P release from sediments during summer nor (2) resulted in an increased permanent P retention. These observations warrant a reevaluation of the well-accepted management strategy of decreasing the lake internal P cycling by maintaining an aerobic hypolimnion and sediment surface. We hypothesize that oxygenation only results in an increased permanent benthic P burial if, because of the depressed sulfide production, more ferrous phosphate (e.g., vivianite) and less FeS is deposited in the anoxic sediment. Hence, it is not the oxic sediment surface that directly affects the permanent redox-dependent sediment P retention but the molar ratio of the available reactive Fe(II) S2-: PO4 in the anoxic sediment. This ratio is driven by the settling rate and the nature of organic matter and particulate iron, as well as the supply of oxygen, nitrate, and sulfate to the sediment.

Evaporation from water (PEw) is generally considered equivalent to evaporation from saturated bare soils (PEs). The influences of the underlying surface on PE as well as the energy and vapour transfer in potential evaporation processes over different surfaces are rarely discussed. In this research, lysimeter experiments were set up to measure the diurnal cycles of evaporation from two saturated sandy soils and water at a high temporal resolution in the Guanzhong Basin, China. Evaporation from Class A Pan, meteorological variables and temperatures were also measured during the experiment. Observation results show that PEs is similar to 12% higher than PEw on a yearly scale. There were also some clear differences in diurnal and seasonal PE dynamics between saturated bare soils and water. In summer, PEs is higher than PEw at day but smaller at night, with the peak value of PEw lagging similar to 4 h behind PEs. These observed PE dynamics and energy transfer processes can be quantitative explained on the basis of a full analysis of the energy balance equation. A comprehensive description of the flux transfer processes showed that these differences in PE are governed by differences in available energy (including albedo and thermal properties) between soils and water. Moreover, the observed differences in PE and vapour transfer processes were reproduced and described by improving the vapour diffusion equation, with considering the influence of different surfaces and boundary layer thicknesses. It is found that dynamics in PE were mainly characterised by surface temperature, which further determined the vapour gradients between the evaporation surface and air flow. The results suggested that differences between PEs and PEw cannot be neglected in hydrological applications. This study can act as both an experimental and theoretical reference for estimating potential evaporation rates.					; Yang, Yuankai/K-5013-2018	Li, Wanxin/0000-0002-1522-5638; Yang, Yuankai/0000-0001-9550-2190													0885-6087	1099-1085				JUN	2023	37	6							e14894	10.1002/hyp.14894	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14894													WOS:000999338700001

This zone of interaction is affected by the westerlies and monsoons making it sensitive to global climate change. Drought is the main type of natural disaster affecting northwest China. Global warming has caused a gradual strengthening of the frequency and intensity of hot extremes, when dry conditions and heatwaves occur simultaneously or successively; as a result, that socioeconomic risks can increase considerably. The present study examined changes in concurrent droughts and hot extremes in northwest China during 1961-2017 based on data from 119 meteorological stations. The result shows that the frequency of concurrent droughts and hot extremes exhibited an increasing trend over most parts of northwest China, while a negative trend occurred in western Xinjiang and at some sites in Qinghai. Concurrent droughts and hot extremes appeared more often in May in western Xinjiang, and in summer in other parts of northwest China. Overall, the trends of such concurrent events, regardless of different definitions, increased from 1961-2017 over northwest China. In particular, from 1981-2017, the trend rose more significantly than in other decades, and reached an abrupt point of change in 1996. Although the trend changed from a positive significant signal to a negative one from 2001-2017, the trend grew 2-3 times from 1997-2017. Changes in large-scale atmospheric circulation show that an anticyclonic circulation strengthened, increasing in geopotential height over the midhigh latitudes of Eurasia and was centred on Mongolia and Lake Baikal. This enhanced relative humidity in western Xinjiang and eastern Qinghai, and weakened it elsewhere from 1997-2017. These changes have contributed to the changes in the spatial distribution and trends in concurrent droughts and hot extremes in northwest China.					; Ren, Guoyu/J-9953-2012; Li, Chaoqun/KIL-7588-2024	Xin, Li/0000-0002-3381-1059; Ren, Guoyu/0000-0002-9351-4179; You, Qinglong/0000-0002-5329-9697; 													0899-8418	1097-0088				MAR 30	2019	39	4					2186	2196		10.1002/joc.5944	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.5944													WOS:000465456400025
J	Marcarelli, AM; Wurtsbaugh, WA				Marcarelli, Amy M.; Wurtsbaugh, Wayne A.			Nitrogen fixation varies spatially and seasonally in linked stream-lake ecosystems	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												We performed surveys of nitrogen (N-2)-fixation in three oligotrophic lake-stream systems in the Sawtooth Mountains of central Idaho to address two questions: (1) Which habitat types within linked lake-stream systems (lake pelagic, lake benthic, and stream) exhibit the highest rates of N-2 fixation?, and (2) How does N-2 fixation compare to the hydrologic flux of nitrogen? A seasonal survey showed that N-2 fixation in a single lake and its outlet stream peaked in late summer, when hydrologic N fluxes were lowest. Benthic lake N-2-fixation rates by epiphytes were highest at mid-lake depths, where their percent cover was highest, while rates by epipelon were greatest at shallow lake depths. Pelagic N-2 fixation was below detection. Stream N-2-fixation rates were greatest on rock substrates and in the lake outlet stream. These patterns were supported by a baseflow survey (late July) in three lake-stream ecosystems which confirmed that N-2-fixation rates peaked in the lake benthos at shallow depths and on rock substrates in outlet streams. Scaling N-2-fixation rates to whole lake and stream areas revealed that N-2 fixation could exceed the nitrate, and sometimes the total dissolved nitrogen flux during baseflow in lakes and outlet streams. Despite low rates, total N-2-fixation contributions (kg/day) from lakes were greater because they had far larger surface areas than the stream environments. Fixed nitrogen contributions from stream outlets were also relatively high because of high N-2-fixation rates and despite low surface areas. This study suggests that N-2 fixation could be a seasonally important nitrogen source to nutrient deficient subalpine lake-stream ecosystems. In addition, the frequency and location of lakes could control N-2-fixation contributions to watersheds by providing a large area for within-lake N-2 fixation, and creating conditions favorable for N-2 fixation in outlet streams.

The degree to which allochthonous substrates support growth of bacteria is largely dependent on bacterial growth efficiency (BGE), i.e., bacterial production ( BP) per unit of assimilated carbon. Here we show how the spatial variability of BGE in the boreal region can be mediated by the distribution of the two dominating landscape elements forest and mires. Using an 11 days bioassay approach, the production and respiration of bacteria were measured in water samples from nine small Swedish streams (64 degrees N 19 degrees E), representing a gradient ranging from organic carbon supplied mainly from peat mires to carbon supplied mainly from coniferous forests. BP was positively correlated to forest coverage (%) of the catchment, while bacterial respiration was similar in all streams. Consequently, BGE showed a strong positive correlation with forest coverage. Partial least square regression showed that BGE was chiefly regulated by qualitative properties of the organic material, indicated by the absorbance ratio a254/a365 plus C/N and C/P ratios. The data suggest that a share of the organic carbon pool, drained mainly from forest soils, had a potential of being incorporated into bacterial biomass with great efficiency. Its potential for supporting growth was probably nutrient regulated as indicated by inorganic nutrient enrichment experiments.

J	RAY, PK				RAY, PK			STRUCTURE AND EVOLUTION OF A PROGRADING RESERVOIR DELTA IN THE DAMODAR RIVER, INDIA	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA												The Damodar River is an ephemeral river with a braided stream pattern in many sections during the flood stage. Flood discharge is concentrated during summer monsoons. Damming of this river has produced 2 deltas, 1 corresponding to the live storage level (upper delta) and the other at flood storage level (lower delta). The progradation of the upper delta over the topset beds of the lower delta coupled with fluctuations in lake level has produced a cyclic progradational deltaic sequence in the reservoir. A significant zoning of the sedimentary structures is observed in the different parts of the delta. Parallel lamination is the major structure in the bottomset area; cross-stratification, ripple drift lamination and deformational structures predominate the foreset area; and horizontal and cross-stratification characterize the topset area. Cyclic sedimentation units with their characteristic sedimentary structures and grain size are also characteristic of the topset area. The alluvial valley section is dominated by multiple units of a variety of cross-stratifications and some upper flow regime flat beds.																			0016-7622	0974-6889					1982	23	7					338	+																WOS:A1982NW19300004

When left unchecked, salvinia forms dense mats on the water surface, limiting sunlight penetration and altering water quality that disrupt ecosystem processes. In 2016, salvinia was first reported in Lake Ossa, Cameroon, and by summer 2021, had expanded to cover almost 49 % of the lake's 4,000-hectare surface. A multinational team initiated a biological control and monitoring program, importing the salvinia weevil, Cyrtobagous salviniae Calder & Sands (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) from Louisiana, USA, in summer 2021. The objectives of this study were to: quantify the changes in salvinia cover and other floating vegetation, document the establishment and impact of the biological control program, and deliver a tool for nearreal time monitoring of floating vegetation. We developed a satellite-based remote sensing application to document in near real-time the changes in coverage of floating vegetation. Using this tool, we quantified the reduction in the salvinia coverage by 80 % within three years of the release of the weevil. Field surveys in 2022 and 2023, demonstrated weevil establishment in the lake and widespread salvinia browning that was associated with weevil damage. Linear regressions of the percent cover of floating vegetation over time, demonstrated that after the weevil release, the rate of change decreased to -1.7 % per 60 days. Field monitoring and satellite imagery showed the establishment of a sedge (Oxycaryum sp., Cyperaceae) within the salvinia mat in late 2021. This secondary invasion slowed the reduction in coverage of floating vegetation from -1.7 % to -0.6 % per 60 days, and warrants further research. By late 2023, the revitalization of Lake Ossa restored fishing and transportation opportunities for the community, and also the comeback the emblematic African manatee. The success of the biological control of salvinia in Lake Ossa is not surprising due to its tropical conditions. However, it highlights the importance of early intervention and continuous monitoring. We propose that the integration of biological control and remote sensing technology is becoming more accessible and can be automated; therefore, a replicable model for future invasive weed programs around the world.

A Theologian's Consideration of Global Warming	THEOLOGY TODAY												Using resources provided by the Bible, tradition, experience, and reason, a close look at magazine articles from the 2023 summer considers the reality of global warming. Scientists exploring a lake's strata, Canadian wildfires, phosphorous runoff, algal blooms, and Phoenix's string of high temperatures suggest we have entered the Anthropocene Era. The idea of domination borrowed from the first chapter of Genesis coupled with Aristotle's Great Chain of Being are used to encourage practices leading to global warming. Theological anomalies from this history raise questions about our continuing use of the triumphal metaphor of God as King of kings. A new ecological awareness and the metaphor of God's Body as the World re-animates theological conversation in this area.

Red River Valley, Manitoba: The Geomorphology of a Low-Relief, Flood-Prone Prairie Landscape	LANDSCAPES AND LANDFORMS OF WESTERN CANADA	World Geomorphological Landscapes											Located between the Manitoba Escarpment (known as the Pembina Escarpment in North Dakota) and a gentle topographic rise to late Quaternary glacial deposits, the Red River valley forms the southern extension of the Manitoba Lowlands. The dominant landform of the central valley is a low-relief clay plain composed of glacilacustrine deposits that accumulated in glacial Lake Agassiz. The north-flowing Red River is a low-energy, suspended sediment, mud-dominated, meandering stream that occupies a shallow stream-cut valley within the low-relief clay plain. Sedimentation along the convex banks of the meanders occurs as overbank and oblique accretion deposits. Significant sedimentation also occurs along the concave banks on the slopes of elongated zones of low-angled earth slides that are common along the river meanders between at least Emerson and St. Adolphe, Manitoba. The Red River is well known for its broad, slow-onset, spring floods. An array of artificial landforms have been constructed to mitigate the flooding hazard, ranging in scale from elevated pads and small ring dykes protecting isolated buildings, large ring dykes protecting towns, and the 48-km Red River Floodway that protects Winnipeg.																			2213-2090	2213-2104	978-3-319-44595-3; 978-3-319-44593-9				2017							143	155		10.1007/978-3-319-44595-3_10	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-44595-3_10	10.1007/978-3-319-44595-3												WOS:000415340100012

A large set of beach and nearshore profile data from southern Lake Michigan has been used to evaluate the widely applied equilibrium profile concept. Results of this study show that the profile form h = Ax(m) is appropriate for use in describing the average profile found in southern Lake Michigan. Although values for the coefficient m varied over a range from 0.3 to 1.1, the mean value of 0.63 is in close agreement with the 0.67 value suggested by theory and supported by R.G. Dean's 1977 analysis of oceanic beach profiles. Conversely, no correlation was found with B. Moore's 1982 curve relating the coefficient A to mean sediment size on the profile. Equilibrium profile adjustment to lake-level change was found to lag either a rise or fall in lake level. The lag period could not be determined, but appears to be on the order of years.																			0380-1330						1994	20	1					206	214		10.1016/S0380-1330(94)71141-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(94)71141-2													WOS:A1994NL34800016

Dust emission response to climate in southern Africa	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The processes which act in mineral dust source regions and factors which contribute to interannual variability within dust plumes emanating from them are poorly understood. In this case study, we focus on processes modulating emissions of atmospheric mineral aerosols from a large ephemeral lake. We focus on one key ephemeral lake dust source in southern Africa, the Makgadikgadi Pans of Botswana. A range of satellite [ for example, Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer ( TOMS), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer ( MODIS)] and climate data ( from meteorological stations and reanalysis data sources) are extracted and compared, highlighting initial problems ( for example, data quality, calibration, record length) associated with long-term ( 10-20 years) monitoring of dust with regional sources in this and other dryland regions. Nevertheless, comparisons of satellite-retrieved inundation, mineral aerosols, vegetation abundance, and climate data for the 1980-2000 period suggest that desert dust loadings are intermittently influenced by the extent and frequency of lake inundation, sediment inflows, and surface wind speed variability. In addition, a significant proportion of the observed variability in the dust and hydrological cycle of this source could also be attributed to El Nino-Southern Oscillation ( ENSO) and Indian Ocean sea surface temperature anomalies. Both are known to have an important role in modulating rainfall variability in southern Africa.

Life history and ecological characteristics of humper and lean ecotypes of lake trout stocked in Lake Erie	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Through combined effects of over-exploitation and predation by invasive non-native sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus (Linneaus 1958), the lake trout Salvelinus namaycush (Walbaum 1972) population in Lake Erie collapsed and was considered extirpated by 1950; annual stocking occurred in 1969 to bolster and maintain this population as natural recruitment ceased. While various hatchery strains of lean ecotype lake trout remain the focus of Lake Erie's stocking, between 2004 and 2011 a humper-like ecotype was stocked to aid re-establishment efforts. We assessed ecotype performance via adult fish collected during the summer-stratified period (2004-2017) and evaluated if life history and ecological characteristics varied between stocked ecotypes. Ecotype-specific differences in survival, length-at-age, accumulation of weight with length, and diet were observed. Lean lake trout grew faster (length-at-age) and matured at larger sizes than the humper ecotype. Humper lake trout exhibited higher sea lamprey wounding and lower survival rates than lean lake trout. Humpers also consumed more benthic prey fish than lean lake trout, suggesting this ecotype may exhibit a more benthic orientation than leans. Our study represents the first evaluation of how a non-lean ecotype lake trout performs outside their native ecosystem and provides fishery managers with valuable information relevant to re-establishing lake trout populations in the Great Lakes.

Despite their importance, there is little information on their age and growth and age validation. Growth zone deposition rate in otoliths of B. lateralis, H. cuvieri, S. intermedius and S. macrocephalus was validated as annual using edge analysis in this study. Annual deposition of growth zones was corroborated by a fluorochrome marking experiment. Both methods demonstrated that one growth zone was deposited annually. Edge analysis demonstrated that the highest proportion of opaque zones was detected between August and December, most likely as a result of slow growth during lower temperature water during the preceding winter.

Thirty nine of those pools had water during the sampling survey, in twenty six sites, thirty two hydrophyte species considered by the hi index were collected. It was observed that: 1) hydrophyte species differed in their optimum growth along a stress gradient calculated from different variables and field observations; 2) the most influent variables regarding the presence of macrophytes in a water body were the hydroperiod and the anthropogenic disturbances related to agricultural and livestock activities; 3) the best ecological quality systems were those located at higher altitudes, with cold and low mineral content waters and with less anthropogenic disturbances; 4) the majority of the localities were poorly conserved, in comparison with previous studies and, finally, 5) many of the studied systems, even with some kind of protection, had lost the categories proposed by Cirujano et al. (1992): wetland with "singular interest", wetland with "national" or with "European significance".																			0213-8409	1989-1806				DEC	2013	32	2					373	390																WOS:000329534000015
J	Postel, SL				Postel, SL			Securing water for people, crops, and ecosystems: New mindset and new priorities	NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM												A fundamentally new approach to water and human development will be needed during this new century if we are to secure sufficient freshwater to meet the needs of some 9 billion people while at the same time protecting the critical ecosystem services upon which the human economy depends. Signs of unsustainable water use - including falling water tables, shrinking lakes, and the drying up of rivers and streams - are widespread and spreading. In many regions, greater modification and appropriation of freshwater systems for human purposes will yield greater costs than benefits and create the risk of irreversible losses of species and ecosystem services. A new mindset is needed to guide water use and management in this new century, one that views the human water economy as a subset of nature's water economy. Living within nature's limits will require that societies satisfy the basic needs of people and ecosystems before non-essential water demands are met. It will require on the order of a doubling of water productivity. And it will require stronger institutions to encourage equitable sharing of water to alleviate tensions within and between countries.																			0165-0203					MAY	2003	27	2					89	98		10.1111/1477-8947.00044	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1477-8947.00044													WOS:000183805200002

Detectable residues of chlordane, heptachlor epoxide and endosulfan were found in 1.6, 6.0 and 19.3% of samples, respectively. Over 50% of the total organochlorine insecticides were transported in the Jan.-April periods corresponding to spring thaws, low ground cover and high suspended solids in the water. Unit area loadings ranged from 0-4.5 mg/ha per yr for chlordane plus heptachlor epoxide and 0-89.9 mg/ha per yr for endosulfan. Water quality objectives proposed by the International Joint Commission [IJC] were exceeded in 4% of samples by heptachlor epoxide and 14% of samples by endosulfan. Sixteen organophosphorus insecticides were known to be used in the watersheds but only chlorpyrifos, diazinon, ethion and malathion were detected. Chlorpyrifos was present in only 3 samples, ethion in 2 and malathion in 4; 87 samples contained diazinon but 64 of these were identified as originating from an indoor (non land-use) activity in 1 watershed. All field losses of organophosphorus insecticides occurred in the May-Aug. period correlating with the season of application. Proposed IJC water quality objectives were exceeded in 1 sample where diazinon was used in land activities and in 77 samples as the result of diazinon being used in an indoor activity. No other organophosphorus insecticides were found which exceed the proposed water quality objectives.																			0048-9697	1879-1026					1980	15	2					169	192		10.1016/0048-9697(80)90006-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0048-9697(80)90006-6													WOS:A1980KD22000005
J	Gooseff, MN; Lyons, WB; McKnight, DM; Vaughn, BH; Fountain, AG; Dowling, C				Gooseff, MN; Lyons, WB; McKnight, DM; Vaughn, BH; Fountain, AG; Dowling, C			A stable isotopic investigation of a polar desert hydrologic system, McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												The hydrologic system of the coastal McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, is defined by snow accumulation, glacier melt, stream flow, and retention in closed-basin, ice-covered lakes. During the austral summers from 1993-1996 and 1999-2000 to 2002-2003, fresh snow, snow pits, glacier ice, stream water, and lake waters were sampled for the stable isotopes deuterium (D) and 180 in order to resolve sources of meltwater and the interactions among the various hydrologic reservoirs in the dry valleys. This data set provides a survey of the distribution of natural water isotope abundances within the well-defined dry valley hydrologic system in Taylor Valley, which extends 20 km inland from McMurdo Sound. The three major Taylor Valley lakes are not connected to one another and their levels are maintained by glacial meltwater inflow and perennial hydrologically, ice-cover sublimation. At the valley scale, glacial ice, snow, stream, and lake waters become more depleted in delta D with increasing distance from McMurdo Sound (further inland). Snow pack in glacial accumulation zones is heterogeneous, likely a result of varying storm sources (continental versus coastal), and, in general, snow pits, fresh snow samples, and glacier ice are more depleted than stream waters. Within the lake basins, glacial ice source waters are depleted by as much as 111 parts per thousand 8D and 20 parts per thousand delta O-18 compared to lake waters. These results demonstrate the importance of in-stream fractionation at the valley scale. In-stream enrichment occurs through direct evaporation fractionation from the channel and hyporheic exchange with isotopically enriched waters in the near-stream subsurface during transport from the glacial source to lake. Furthermore, the results show that lake waters directly reflect their glacial ice sources, despite fractionation during stream transport. Inter-annual comparisons of lake profiles suggest that lake waters are directly influenced by the isotopic composition and amount of stream flow during a season.					; Gooseff, Michael/N-6087-2015; Vaughn, Bruce/AAO-8867-2020	VAUGHN, BRUCE/0000-0001-6503-957X; Gooseff, Michael/0000-0003-4322-8315; MCKNIGHT, DIANE/0000-0002-4171-1533													1523-0430	1938-4246				FEB	2006	38	1					60	71		10.1657/1523-0430(2006)038[0060:ASIIOA]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1523-0430(2006)038[0060:ASIIOA]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000235385100007

Pu-244 is also one of a number of isotopes which may be detectable as live radioactivity on earth, originating from the Interstellar Medium (ISM). There has been a recent attempt to measure a ISM isotope signature of Pu-244 [ApJ 558 (2001) L133]. This rises the question of the presence of an anthropogenic contribution in the environment. In order to better assess the Pu-244 fall-out on earth, we have started a program at VERA to measure Pu-244 in surface sediments of Lake Michigan, routinely sampled for Pu-239,Pu-240 measurements. Considerable amount of information on other isotopes exist for Lake Michigan. We have reproduced the expected Pu-241/Pu-239 and Pu-240/Pu-239 ratios for the global fallout. The measured Pu-244/Pu-230 was considerably higher than expected and was therefore most likely the result of contamination. Measurement of samples specifically prepared for the measurement of Pu-244 will be tried in the future. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

J	Bosman, AM; Reyes-Centeno, H; Harvati, K				Bosman, Abel Marinus; Reyes-Centeno, Hugo; Harvati, Katerina			A virtual assessment of the suprainiac depressions on the Eyasi I (Tanzania) and Aduma ADU-VP-1/3 (Ethiopia) Pleistocene hominin crania	JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION												Despite a steady increase in our understanding of the phenotypic variation of Pleistocene Homo, debate continues over phylogenetically informative features. One such trait is the suprainiac fossa, a depression on the occipital bone above inion that is commonly considered an autapomorphy of the Neanderthal lineage. Challenging this convention, depressions in the suprainiac region have also been described for two Pleistocene hominin crania from sub-Saharan Africa: Eyasi I (Tanzania) and ADU-VP-1/3 (Ethiopia). Here, we use a combined quantitative and qualitative approach, using mu CT imaging, to investigate the occipital depressions on these specimens. The results show that neither the external nor the internal morphologies of these depressions bear any resemblance to the Neanderthal condition. A principal component analysis based on multiple thickness measurements along the occipital squama demonstrates that the relative thickness values for the internal structures in Eyasi I and ADU-VP-1/3 are within the range of Homo sapiens. Thus, our results support the autapomorphic status of the Neanderthal suprainiac fossa and highlight the need to use nuanced approaches and multiple lines of evidence. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The climate of this region was dry in the glacial period, and wet in the Holocene. Desalination of Lake Hovsgol occurred at 13.2-11.6 cal ka BP, i. e., during the transition from the late glacial to early Holocene. At the same time, ca. 12.82 cal ka BP, deposition in the Lake Erhel area changed from fluvial to lacustrine. Climate of northern Mongolia was humid during the late glacial to the early Holocene period ( ca. 10.57-7.24 cal ka BP for the Hovsgol and from ca. 12.82 to 7-8 cal ka BP for the Erhel). This reconstruction differs from that for the more northern Lake Baikal region, which humidification continued from the last glacial period until mid-Holocene. This difference could be attributed to longer period of glacier melting and permafrost thawing around the Baikal and on its watershed, associated with increased summer insolation.

Surface discharge from the basin to the lake is 63 m(3)/year and underground discharge is 114 m(3)/year. Possible water pollution is categorized into domestic, industrial and agricultural origin. Domestic and industrial wastewaters, including effluents from leather tanneries are discharged, without being purified, into Yalvac Stream, which flows into Egirdir Lake directly or via the drainage canal. Surface waters flowing into the lake are used in winter for irrigation of agricultural areas. In agricultural areas natural and synthetic fertilizers and pesticides are used extensively. Lake Egirdir is used as a source of drinking water. Sampling sites were established for surface and underground waters, taking into account the known point sources of pollution. These sites were sampled in May and October of 2002, and analysed chemically. Cr(3+) and Pb(2+) concentrations exceed standard limits, meaning that pollution caused by effluent from the tanneries is adversely affecting the water quality in the lake.					; Karagüzel, Remzi/B-7824-2018; Soyaslan, İbrahim/AAA-1927-2020; KARAGUZEL, REMZI/B-7824-2018	soyaslan, ibrahim iskender/0000-0001-5282-8094; KARAGUZEL, REMZI/0000-0001-5470-7763													0943-0105					SEP	2008	55	6					1263	1268		10.1007/s00254-007-1074-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-007-1074-2													WOS:000258673500012
J	RENMAN, G				RENMAN, G			LIFE HISTORIES OF 2 CLONAL POPULATIONS OF STRATIOTES-ALOIDES L	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Life-history characteristics of two north Swedish populations of Stratiotes aloides L. are compared. One population consists of an emergent phenotype, living in a nutrient-rich lake. The other population is entirely formed by submersed plants, living in a nutrient-poor, riverside lagoon. Plants from each population transplanted to the other habitat showed that the emergent form was able to develop a submersed habit, whereas no significant change was observed in the submerged form. The life cycle of the species is characterized by a winter-green period, during which the emergent form retained 36% and the submerged form 63% of its maximum biomass, respectively. Leaf turnover of both forms followed the same pattern, with successively increasng losses of old leaves during the growing season, resulting in an overwintering rosette made up of freshly-produced leaves. The number of turions and offsets produced by the emergent form is somewhat higher than those of the submerged form but the latter is suggested to allocate a greater proportion of energy to forming well-developed offsets. Under in situ experimental conditions during the growing season, the number of plants in both populations increased by 70% and no mortality was observed. Concentration of potassium in the plant tissues of both forms increased throughout the growing season, that of calcium increased up to the time of peak biomass in August. The contents of phosphorus of the emergent plants transplanted to the lagoon decreased and the nitrogen content increased in relation to the mineral contents of the emergent plants in the lake. The opposite pattern in the contents of phosphorus and nitrogen was found for the submerged plants transplanted.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV 29	1989	185	3					211	222		10.1007/BF00036609	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00036609													WOS:A1989CK35300005
J	Sanches, RA; Futemma, CRT; Alves, HQ				Sanches, Rosely Alvim; Tomiko Futemma, Celia Regina; Alves, Heber Queiroz			Indigenous territories and governance of forest restoration in the Xingu River (Brazil)	LAND USE POLICY												During the early 2000s, indigenous and non-indigenous peoples inhabiting the headwaters of the Xingu River (Mato Grosso state, Brazil) engaged in a collective decision to undertake the `Y Ikatu Xingu Campaign, a social phenomenon and forum for the restoration and protection of Xingu?s headwaters and riparian forests?a commonpool resources shared by indigenous, farmers, and urban populations in the region. These areas have been significantly deforested over the last 50 years due to public policies and land privatization aiming at economic development, agricultural and agribusiness expansion in Central and Amazonian Brazil. These political and economic drivers contributed to the conversion of five million hectares of Seasonal Evergreen Forests and Cerrados (Brazilian savanna) into agricultural land. In order to reverse the damaging trends of the future of the Xingu River and promote common benefits to indigenous and non-indigenous peoples, the Campaign fostered the creation of the Xingu Seed Network to promote exchange and commercialization of native seeds demanded by farmers and landholders for planting and restoring permanent preservation areas, such as riparian forests, and vegetation associated with lakes and springs of the Sui?a-Mi?u River Basin. The aim of this study is to examine the role played by the ?Y Ikatu Campaign in the conservation of these common-pool resources ? Xingu?s headwaters, riparian forests and rivers?and in mobilizing heterogeneous social groups living in this region to engage in the protection of the watershed.. Our analysis focuses on socially and culturally diverse inhabitants (indigenous and farmers) of the Sui?a-Mi?u River Basin, who are searching for innovative technologies for the recovery of riparian areas, and for income generation for local communities. The Institutional Analysis and Development framework was adopted as an approach for understanding interactions of multiple social agents, governmental and nongovernmental organizations, engaged in the process of restoration and protection of common resources. Spatial and temporal land-cover changes analysis of the Sui?a-Mi?u River Basin show an increase in deforestation during the past 40 years, primarily for soybean farming and pastures. We showed that indigenous people have a fundamental role in questioning and advancing the outcomes of restoration efforts, and monitoring environmental impact on water quality of rivers, as well as on conditions of forests and other ecosystems surrounding indigenous lands. We discuss the perspectives of K?se?dje? indigenous inhabitants of the environmental governance related to restoration efforts and monitoring, and their concerns with a dynamic scenario of agribusiness expansion in the Xingu River Headwaters region.

The d-excess has been calculated, based on the systematic analysis of the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios, in precipitation samples from Kalamazoo, southwest Michigan. The results show that moisture derived from the evaporation of Lake Michigan contributes between 9-16% during the summer months to the atmospheric vapor load in the region. Admittedly, this estimate is an upper value since in our model we have assumed that transpiration from leaf surfaces is minimal compared to the evaporation from Lake Michigan. It is therefore obvious that large freshwater systems need to be regarded as a potentially significant source of atmospheric vapor load. Isotopic investigations such as this will enable to attain quantitative estimates of this important aspect, a knowledge of which, will enhance the usefulness of or perhaps even be essential in calculations based on many atmospheric circulation models.																			0016-7037					OCT	1995	59	20					4279	4283		10.1016/0016-7037(95)00256-Y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(95)00256-Y													WOS:A1995TC22800013
J	Oswald, CJ; Rouse, WR				Oswald, CJ; Rouse, WR			Thermal characteristics and energy balance of various-size Canadian Shield lakes in the Mackenzie River basin	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												This study addresses the thermal and energy budget characteristics of four different-size Canadian Shield lakes in the Mackenzie River basin during the ice-free season of 2000. The objectives are to characterize and compare the surface temperature and thermal structures, and to quantify the magnitudes and flux rates of the energy balance components of each lake. This study highlights the variability in thermal and energy balance characteristics arising from differences in mean lake depth and surface area. The lakes exhibit similar temporal patterns for air temperature, net radiation, wind speed, and wind direction. Net radiation and wind speed are highest over the largest lake, Great Slave Lake, due to colder surface temperatures and lengthy across-lake wind fetch, respectively. During the warming phase of the summer, surface temperature is inversely related to mean depth; however, during the cooling phase this relationship reverses. The shallowest of the four lakes remains isothermal during the entire ice-free period, while the three larger and deeper lakes are all dimictic. A lag in the onset of thermal stratification in the dimictic lakes is positively correlated with mean depth and surface area. Large evaporative water losses correspond to periods of low net radiation and cold dry air over Great Slave Lake. However, over the smaller, shallower lakes periods of high evaporation occur on days with high net radiation and warm, dry air. The capacity of larger lakes to store more heat results in longer ice-free periods and higher evaporation. Maximum heat content increases and occurs later for lakes of greater depth. Maximum evaporative rates occur later and cumulative evaporation is highest for lakes of greater depth and area. The ratios of total open water evaporation for the four lakes in order of size (smallest = 1.0) are 1.0 : 1.2 : 1.3 : 1.4. Evaporation magnitudes are discussed in the context of other temperate and high-latitude lake studies.																			1525-755X	1525-7541				FEB	2004	5	1					129	144		10.1175/1525-7541(2004)005<0129:TCAEBO>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1525-7541(2004)005<0129:TCAEBO>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000189076700009
J	Mortimer, CH				Mortimer, C. H.			Inertial oscillations and related internal beat pulsations and surges in Lakes Michigan and Ontario	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Records of water temperature, current, and wind, made during campaigns on Lakes Michigan 1963 and Ontario 1972, are searched for inertial responses to wind action: (i) circle-tracking currents; and (ii) isotherm-depth undulations, i.e., long internal wave manifestations of forcing by wind. With stratification absent in winter, only response (i) is seen (and then only rarely) with periods very close to the local inertial period, T-in. After whole-basin stratification is complete, both responses (i) and (ii) occur frequently, as internal Kelvin waves (shore-trapped and not further treated here) and cross-basin Poincare internal seiche modes. Mode periods range between 1% and 15% less than T-in, depending on which of the here-modeled modes have responded and on differences between modes in their partitioning of kinetic and potential energy. When, in both lakes, short-duration wind impulses were followed by a week or more of relative calm, Poincare mode combinations produced beat pulsations in both responses (i) and (ii), diagnostic features of which sometimes permitted participating modes to be identified. At a nearshore downwelled front in Lake Ontario, another type of poststorm adjustment was seen. Periodically released from the front, internal surges migrated across the basin through fields of inertially rotating, response (i) currents.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	2006	51	5					1941	1955		10.4319/lo.2006.51.5.1941	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2006.51.5.1941													WOS:000240673800001
J	Mollard, JD				Mollard, JD			Ice-shaped ring-forms in Western Canada: their airphoto expressions and manifold polygenetic origins	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												A variety of ice-shaped ring forms and patterns in Western Canada are strikingly expressed in black-and-white aerial photographs. The most common forms are round and oval mounds and plateaus with rim ridges around summit craters. It is speculated that small clusters and large fields of them originated from dead-ice supraglacial and subglacial wasting processes, and often from a combination of both where shallow glacial lake waters were present. Other ice-shaped ring features and patterns illustrated in this paper result from former and present permafrost and periglacial activity, groundwater discharge and winter ice mounding and expansion that transfer fine sediment from circular orifices to their margins, slush formation that creates fractal-like patterns on thin ice floating on shallow snow-covered lakes, and wind-driven icebergs and lake ice that produce circular scours on the beds of glacial lakes. Portions of contact airphotos have been included to show better examples of ring forms and patterns in Western Canada. Speculations on their manifold polygenetic origins are presented.

Notably, urban land-cover change and anthropogenic heat release were responsible for 64% and 36% of the UHI intensity, respectively. Both cool and green roofs decreased near-surface air temperatures. The most dramatic decrease in near-surface air temperature occurred in the late morning; nocturnal air temperature decreased slightly because of the decrease in urban heat storage associated with the cool roof strategy. In addition, the UHI mitigation strategies affected the entire urban boundary layer. The decrease in the potential temperature and static stability created a stable urban boundary layer in which turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) decreased simultaneously. Analysis of an urban belt near a large water body showed that the decrease in the surface skin temperature difference between land and the water body weakened the daytime lake breeze. This effect was observed in both the inflow in the boundary layer and the return flow above the boundary layer, and it decreased the heat and moisture exchange between the lake and land boundary layers.

J	LOHMAN, K; JONES, JR; PERKINS, BD				LOHMAN, K; JONES, JR; PERKINS, BD			EFFECTS OF NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT AND FLOOD FREQUENCY ON PERIPHYTON BIOMASS IN NORTHERN OZARK STREAMS	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Ambient nutrient concentrations (TN and TP) and periphyton biomass (Chl a) were measured every 2 wk during March-November in 1985 and 1986 at 22 sites on 12 streams in the northern Ozarks, Missouri. Benthic Chl a was positively correlated in both years with log TN (R2 = 0.58, 0.60) and with log TP (R2 = 0.47, 0.60). When sites were grouped by the degree of enrichment and plotted over time, benthic Chl a decreased at all sites after flood events but rebounded more rapidly at highly enriched sites. Differences in recovery following flooding were most obvious in fall 1986, when both high and moderately enriched sites exhibited similar biomass accrual patterns, reaching mean benthic Chl a of 397.4 and 321.1 mg.m2, respectively, within 42 d after a catastrophic flood. In contrast, average benthic Chl a at nutrient-poor sites reached a maximum level of 76.8 mg.m-2 within 28 d after flooding, suggesting that maximum standing crops are influenced by both nutrient supply and the length of the flood-free period.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JUN	1992	49	6					1198	1205		10.1139/f92-135	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f92-135													WOS:A1992HY49300016

In 2009, a forecast of bloom transport was also developed using a hydrodynamic model to forecast the trajectory of the bloom. These forecasts have been disseminated from 2008 to the present in the form of a bulletin which is emailed to local managers, health departments, researchers and other stakeholders. The number of bulletins issued each year, as well as the number of subscribers that receive the weekly bulletins, has increased significantly every year that the system has been in place. This manuscript discusses results from the first 3 years that the forecasts were distributed (2008-2010), describes the components of the forecasts, and will conclude with possible improvements that could be made to the forecast system. Harmful algal blooms of the genus Microcystis were found in all 3 years, and the development of these blooms was associated with water temperatures >18 degrees C and wind stresses <0.04 Pa. Wind stresses >0.1 Pa were associated with bloom dispersement as were temperatures <18 degrees C. The present forecasting system was deemed adequate, but improvements in the use of additional remote sensing products and post-processing would yield a more accurate forecast.

Construction was completed on a 73 turbine, 25 megawatt windplant on Buffalo Ridge near Lake Benton, Minnesota in Spring 1994. The number of birds killed at existing windplants in California caused concern about the potential impacts of the Buffalo Ridge facility on the arian community. From April 1994 through Dec. 1995 we searched the Buffalo Ridge windplant site for dead birds. Additionally, we evaluated search efficiency, predator scavenging rates and rate of carcass decomposition. During 20 mo of monitoring we found 12 dead birds. Collisions with wind turbines were suspected for 8 of the 12 birds. During observer efficiency trials searchers found 78.8% of carcasses. Scavengers removed 39.5% of carcasses during scavenging trials. All carcasses remained recognizable during 7 d decomposition trials. After correction for biases we estimated that approximately 36 +/- 12 birds (<1 dead bird per turbine) were killed at the Buffalo Ridge windplant in 1 y. Although windplants do not appear to be more detrimental to birds than other man-made structures, proper facility siting is an important first consideration in ol der to avoid unnecessary fatalities.																			0003-0031	1938-4238				JAN	2000	143	1					41	52		10.1674/0003-0031(2000)143[0041:BMAWWT]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1674/0003-0031(2000)143[0041:BMAWWT]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000084690600003

Patterns are potentially linked to permafrost degradation and affect carbon fluxes. First, a land cover unit retrieval scheme which provides unprecedented detail by fusion of satellite data using Sentinel-1 (synthetic aperture radar) and Sentinel-2 (multispectral) was adapted. Patterns of lakes, wetlands, general soil moisture conditions and vegetation physiognomy are interpreted at 10 m nominal resolution. Units with similar patterns were identified with a k -means approach and documented through statistics derived from comprehensive in situ records for soils and vegetation (more than 3500 samples). The result goes beyond the capability of existing land cover maps which have deficiencies in spatial resolution, thematic content and accuracy, although landscape heterogeneity related to moisture gradients cannot be fully resolved at 10 m. Wetness gradients were assessed, and measures for landscape heterogeneity were derived north of the treeline. About 40 % of the area north of the treeline falls into three units of dry types with limited shrub growth. Wetter regions have higher land cover diversity than drier regions. An area of 66 % of the analysed Arctic landscape is highly heterogeneous with respect to wetness at a 1 km scale (representative scale of frequently used regional land cover and permafrost modelling products). Wetland areas cover 9 % and moist tundra types 32 %, which is of relevance for methane flux upscaling.

Early to mid-Holocene thermokarst lake deposits contain rich floral and faunal paleoassemblages, which indicate lake shrinkage and decreasing summer temperatures (chironomid-based T-July) from 10.5 to 3.5 cal kyr BP with the warmest period between 10.5 and 8 cal kyr BP. Talik refreezing and pingo growth started about 3.5 cal kyr BP after disappearance of the lake. The isotopic composition of the pingo ice (delta O-18 - 17.1 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand, delta D -144.5 +/- 3.4 parts per thousand, slope 5.85, deuterium excess -7.7 +/- 1.5 parts per thousand) point to the initial stage of closed-system freezing captured in the record. A differing isotopic composition within the massive ice body was found (delta O-18 - 21.3 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand, delta D -165 +/- 11.5 parts per thousand, slope 8.13, deuterium excess 4.9 +/- 3.2 parts per thousand), probably related to the infill of dilation cracks by surface water with quasi-meteoric signature. Currently inactive syngenetic ice wedges formed in the thermokarst basin after lake drainage. The pingo preserves traces of permafrost response to climate variations in terms of ground-ice degradation (thermokarst) during the early and mid-Holocene, and aggradation (wedge-ice and pingo-ice growth) during the late Holocene.

Brown trout Salmo trutta redd superimposition by spawning Lampetra species in a lowland stream	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Reproductive interaction between sympatric lampreys and salmonids was studied. The superimposition of brown trout Salmo trutta redds by spring-spawning river lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis and brook lamprey Lampetra planeri was examined in a small lowland stream of western Lithuania. A high superimposition rate of S. trutta redds by both L. fluviatilis (up to 83%) and L. planeri (up to 48%) was found, when the spawning intensity of Lampetra spp. was high. The occurrence of this phenomenon is the result of the overlap in the spawning habitat preferences at the reach-scale and at the microhabitat scale for the three species. One of the main requirements for Lampetra spp. spawning site selection was the negative streambed slope, an essential trait of the pool-riffle transitional zone. The structure of the salmonid redd created a considerable negative microhabitat slope suitable for Lampetra spp. spawning, which put the redds under a higher susceptibility to be superimposed. The timing of Lampetra spp. spawning overlapped closely with the emergence of S. trutta fry, suggesting a probable ecological effect of superimposition on S. trutta in the pre-emergent and emerging stages.

We hypothesized that the NR activities were due to phytoplankton in the epilimnion, due to the ciliate Loxodes at the mid-depth oxic/anoxic interface and preferentially due to bacteria in the anoxic hypolimnion of the lake. In support of the hypothesis, a significant negative correlation was detected in the metalimnion between the abundance of Loxodes and nitrate concentrations, indicating nitrate use by the ciliate, and significant positive correlations were found between bacteria and nitrite concentrations at depth. The correlations are corroborated by additional evidence from chlorophyll a/NRA ratios, nitrite dynamics, and lake circulation patterns. Other ciliates besides Loxodes did not appear to significantly contribute to NRA potential. The data suggest that facultatively anaerobic ciliates such as Loxodes may be significant contributors to denitrification in eutrophic planktonic ecosystems.

J	Wilhelm, S; Hintze, T; Livingstone, DM; Adrian, R				Wilhelm, Susann; Hintze, Thomas; Livingstone, David M.; Adrian, Rita			Long-term response of daily epilimnetic temperature extrema to climate forcing	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Twenty years (1983-2002) of hourly summer temperature data from the epilimnion of Muggelsee, a shallow lake in northern Germany, showed a long-term increase, with the rate of increase of the daily minima (nighttime temperatures) exceeding that of the daily maxima (daytime temperatures). This does not simply reflect the long-term behaviour of air temperature, which did not exhibit a significant degree of day-night asymmetry. A sensitivity analysis based on a heat-balance model revealed that the daily extrema of the lake surface equilibrium temperature responded differently not only to shifts in air temperature, but also to shifts in wind speed, relative humidity, and cloud cover, suggesting that long-term changes in all four variables contribute to day-night asymmetry in the epilimnetic temperature. A comparison of nighttime and daytime estimates of the heat flux components into the lake indicates that the emission of long-wave radiation from the atmosphere is likely to be the main process responsible for day-night asymmetry in the epilimnetic temperature. Although this process is partially dependent on air temperature, it is also dependent on relative humidity and cloud cover. The influence of long-term changes in these additional driving variables on epilimnetic temperatures cannot therefore be neglected.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				NOV	2006	63	11					2467	2477		10.1139/F06-140	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F06-140													WOS:000241965000007

Analyses of the gels identified a total of 230 bands spread across 57 different positions. Among those bands, 14 were shared between lakes from Hope Bay and Potter Peninsula, 17 were observed only in particular lakes, and 17 were registered both years in the same lake. We successfully reamplified and sequenced 43 bands located in 36 different positions belonging to Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Cyanobacteria. The closest matches for 63% of the sequenced bands were from Antarctic or from other cold environment clones and sequences already in the databases, suggesting the widespread dominance of microbial communities adapted to cold habitats. The results of the multivariate analyses (Cluster Analysis and CCA) indicated that the nutrient status of the lake influences the bacterioplankton assemblages.					; Gasol, Josep/B-1709-2008; Gasol, Josep M/B-1709-2008	Unrein, Fernando/0000-0002-8592-1858; Gasol, Josep M/0000-0001-5238-2387; Balague, Vanessa/0000-0001-6813-8207; Schiaffino, Maria Romina/0000-0002-9383-2003													0722-4060	1432-2056				JUN	2009	32	6					923	936		10.1007/s00300-009-0593-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00300-009-0593-6													WOS:000266052000011

Labrador assemblages were almost completely lacking in identifiable structure. Newfoundland species clustered into two groups of different body size, suggesting the influence of fish predation. Only one species in Labrador and Newfoundland was significantly correlated with a derived factor related to lake water buffering capacity. New Brunswick.sbd.Nova Scotia species clustered into two groups, one featuring significant positive and the other significant negative correlations with the buffering factor. From this we conclude that acidification is having an impact on the limnetic zooplankton of these two provinces. Multiple discriminant analysis was used to demonstrate that New Brunswick.sbd.Nova Scotia lakes differing in their buffering capacity were also distinct in zooplankton composition. Lakes with low factor scores (low pH, alkalinity, and calcium) were mainly located in the Bay of Fundy region; this area has above average fog and precipitation, and lies within the summer air flow carrying pollutants from the south.

J	SHIAH, FK; DUCKLOW, HW				SHIAH, FK; DUCKLOW, HW			TEMPERATURE AND SUBSTRATE REGULATION OF BACTERIAL ABUNDANCE, PRODUCTION AND SPECIFIC GROWTH-RATE IN CHESAPEAKE BAY, USA	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Effects of temperature and substrate addition (glucose, ammonium or dissolved free amino acid) on bacterial growth were studied in short-term incubations of samples from north, mid and south Chesapeake Bay and a small salt marsh creek, in 1991 and 1992. Bacterial specific growth rates were exponentially and positively correlated with incubation temperature in all seasons studied. Relationships with temperature were consistently similar across different estuarine habitats and chlorophyll concentrations (2 to 50 mu g l(-1)) at incubation temperatures ranging from 3 to 25 degrees C. Within this temperature range, the average Q(10) value for bacterial specific growth rates was 2.72 +/- 0.26. Substrate enrichment did not increase bacterial abundance, production and specific growth rate within 24 h when water temperature was <7 degrees C. At higher temperatures (>20 degrees C), substrate enrichment effects occurred after 3 h incubation although the effect was not consistent across study areas. Temperature-substrate interaction experiments showed that temperature was more effective in regulating bacterial production and specific growth rate than substrate when compared on the same time scale. The substrate enrichment effect on bacterial growth appeared to be temperature dependent. High temperature dependency and the lack of substrate effect on bacterial growth at temperatures <20 degrees C suggested that estuarine bacterial growth was not limited by substrate supply but by temperature during non-summer seasons. Response of bacteria to temperature was uniform across a range of time scales. There was no evidence of adaptation to in situ temperature by bacterial assemblages in different seasons. The seasonal cycle of bacterial growth rate can largely be explained as a physiological response to the in situ temperature by a eurythermal bacterial community.

Its abnormal change would have a serious impact on the social economy, ecological development and life safety. In recent decades, many studies about extreme precipitation have been performed on spatio-temporal variation patterns under global changes; little research has been conducted on the regionality and persistence, which tend to be more destructive. This study defines extreme precipitation events by percentile method, then applies the spatio-temporal scanning model (STSM) and the local spatial autocorrelation model (LSAM) to explore the spatio-temporal aggregation characteristics of extreme precipitation, taking China in July as a case. The study result showed that the STSM with the LSAM can effectively detect the spatio-temporal accumulation areas. The extreme precipitation events of China in July 2016 have a significant spatio-temporal aggregation characteristic. From the spatial perspective, China's summer extreme precipitation spatio-temporal clusters are mainly distributed in eastern China and northern China, such as Dongting Lake plain, the Circum-Bohai Sea region, Gansu, and Xinjiang. From the temporal perspective, the spatio-temporal clusters of extreme precipitation are mainly distributed in July, and its occurrence was delayed with an increase in latitude, except for in Xinjiang, where extreme precipitation events often take place earlier and persist longer.					; Shen, Shi/W-4256-2019; Zhang, Ting/AFK-0023-2022	chen, shi/0000-0001-9126-229X; YE, Sijing/0000-0002-8805-8914; Zhang, Ting/0000-0003-4975-0200; 														2073-4433				FEB	2021	12	2							218	10.3390/atmos12020218	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos12020218													WOS:000622171200001

Oscillating episodes of climate change during the Oligocene Miocene transition (OMT) have however been difficult to reconcile with existing pCO(2) records. Here we present a new pCO(2) record from the OMT into the early Miocene, reconstructed using the stomatal proxy method with a database of fossil Lauraceae leaves from New Zealand. The leaf database derives from three relatively well-dated sites located in the South Island of New Zealand; Foulden Maar, Mataura River and Grey Lake. Atmospheric pCO(2) values were obtained based on four separate calibrations with three nearest living equivalents, using the stomatal ratio method as well as transfer functions. Our results, based on the mean values of each of the four calibrations, indicate pCO(2) ranging 582-732 ppm (average 650 ppm) at the OMT, falling precipitously to mean values of 430-538 ppm (average 492 ppm) for the earliest Miocene and similar to 454-542 ppm (average 502 ppm) in the early Miocene. The much higher values of pCO(2) at the OMT indicate that pCO played an important role in climate dynamics during this time, potentially including the abrupt termination of glaciations.

While classical interpretations of such records were conducted in terms of local precipitation, simulations conducted with atmospheric general circulation models enabled with water stable isotopes have suggested that past changes in south Asia precipitation delta O-18 may be driven by remote processes linked to moisture transport. Studies conducted at the event scale can provide constraints to assess the drivers of precipitation delta O-18 and the validity of simulated mechanisms. Here, we take advantage of new event precipitation delta O-18 monitored from January 2005 to December 2007 at two southern Tibetan Plateau stations (Lhasa and Nyalam). The drivers of daily to seasonal variations are investigated using statistical relationships with local and regional temperature, precipitation amount and convective activity based on in situ data and satellite products. The strongest control on precipitation delta O-18 at Lhasa during the monsoon season at event and seasonal scales is provided by the integrated regional convective activity upstream air mass trajectories, cumulated over several days. In contrast, the integrated convection appears to be the main driver of precipitation delta O-18 at Nyalam only in July and August, and the situation is more complex in other months. Local climate variables can only account for a small fraction of the observed delta O-18 variance, with significant differences between both stations. This study offers a better constraint on climate archives interpretation in the southern Tibetan Plateau. The daily data presented here also provides a benchmark to evaluate the capacity of isotopically enabled atmospheric general circulation models (iGCMs) to simulate the response of precipitation delta O-18 to convection. This is illustrated using a nudged and zoomed simulation with the LMDZiso model. While it successfully simulates some seasonal and daily characteristics of precipitation delta O-18 in the southern Tibetan Plateau, it fails to simulate the correlation between delta O-18 and upstream precipitation. This calls for caution when using atmospheric models to interpret precipitation delta O-18 archives in terms of past monsoon variability.

J	Aeberhard, S				Aeberhard, Stefan			North Queensland regional power independence and a superb new water supply for Cairns	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT					3rd International Conference on the Challenges in Environmental Science and Engineering (CESE)	SEP 26-OCT 01, 2010	Cairns, AUSTRALIA					We present hydrological and economic modeling of a dam 40 km south of Cairns at an altitude of 620 m. The key is a relatively large dam wall and a small but deep 40 GL lake in a catchment area that receives 6-10 m of precipitation annually (120-160 GL run off). This would secure all current and future water needs for Cairns. The lake would be coupled by a vertical shaft to a 250 MW (peak) hydro-power station 500 m below and inside the mountain. From there, a 6 km tunnel running east connects with the coastal dam service-tunnel and a 3 km tunnel running west takes the water back to the river below the falls. On average this would result in the release of 300 ML/d opening up opportunities for tourism, new industries, and irrigated farming of high yield crops. The tunnel offers the possibility of a new transport corridor from the Coast to Atherton on the central tablelands. The increased flows in the dry season could be important for the health of the river which is also a nursery-ground for the Great Barrier Reef. The CO2 savings from reduced coal fire power needs are significant. Comparative analysis with all three local dams shows that the proposed lake is smaller and many times more useful per m(2). Importantly, this reliable hydro-power would allow considerable regional load-balancing of unreliable wind and solar power, representing a big step away from dependence on remotely provided power which is a key recommendation in the widely supported Tropical North Queensland - Sustainable Region Initiative.																			1944-3994					AUG	2011	32	1-3					86	94		10.5004/dwt.2011.2682	http://dx.doi.org/10.5004/dwt.2011.2682													WOS:000297923600013

Geological evidence suggests that during the Pliocene, many modern-day desert regions received higher levels of rainfall and supported large perennial lakes and wetter vegetation types. These wetter conditions have been difficult to reconcile with model predictions of 21st century drying over most subtropical land regions. Using an atmospheric General Circulation Model, we show that underestimates of Pliocene rainfall over certain areas in models may be related to insufficient sea surface temperature (SST) warmth simulated over relatively local eastern boundary current regions. When SSTs off the coast of California are raised to more closely match some proxy reconstructions, rainfall increases over much of adjacent western North America. Over the southwestern USA, this increased rainfall is mainly due to a convergent monsoonal circulation that develops over late boreal summer. A smaller wintertime increase in precipitation also occurs due to differences in rainfall associated with midlatitude cyclones. Wetter land conditions are expected to weaken upwelling-favorable coastal winds, so that increased rainfall caused by coastal SST warming suggests a positive feedback that could help sustain wet, Pliocene-like conditions.

The effect of large scale resuspension on organic contaminant cycling was investigated using a two-pronged sample collection strategy that included analysis of settling sediment trap material and discrete air and water samples collected before and after a major resuspension event. It was found that major resuspension events result in a large flux of contaminants. For example, 6.2 ng/cm(2) SigmaPCB (sum of 89 congener peaks) and 175 ng/cm(2) SigmaPAHs (sum of 31 compounds) fell through the water column in the southern basin between November and May but almost half of that occurred in the month of March after a series of intense storms induced a large-scale resuspension event in that month. Assuming the concentration of contaminants in settling sediments is similar throughout the basin, the March event brought similar to400 kg of SigmaPCBs and similar to13,000 kg SigmaPAHs into the water column. Furthermore, the data indicate that concentrations of dissolved phase SigmaPCB and SigmaPAHs declined significantly (alpha = 0.05) after the event and after resuspended sediment had settled from the surface waters. As a result of the depressed dissolved concentrations at the surface, the potential for gas-phase input to the lake increases on the southwestern coastal region near Chicago, IL and Gary, IN. The potential input of gas-phase contaminants was 8 kg for SigmaPCBs and 2,200 kg for SigmaPAHs over the 40-day lifetime of the near-shore event.

Environmental Influences on the Spatial Ecology of Juvenile Smalltooth Sawfish (Pristis pectinata): Results from Acoustic Monitoring	PLOS ONE												To aid recovery efforts of smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata) populations in U.S. waters a research project was developed to assess how changes in environmental conditions within estuarine areas affected the presence, movements, and activity space of this endangered species. Forty juvenile P. pectinata were fitted with acoustic tags and monitored within the lower 27 km of the Caloosahatchee River estuary, Florida, between 2005 and 2007. Sawfish were monitored within the study site from 1 to 473 days, and the number of consecutive days present ranged from 1 to 125. Residency index values for individuals varied considerably, with annual means highest in 2005 (0.95) and lowest in 2007 (0.73) when several P. pectinata moved upriver beyond detection range during drier conditions. Mean daily activity space was 1.42 km of river distance. The distance between 30-minute centers of activity was typically <0.1 km, suggesting limited movement over short time scales. Salinity electivity analysis demonstrated an affinity for salinities between 18 and at least 24 psu, suggesting movements are likely made in part, to remain within this range. Thus, freshwater flow from Lake Okeechobee (and its effect on salinity) affects the location of individuals within the estuary, although it remains unclear whether or not these movements are threatening recovery.

Such a clear-water phase occurs during mid-May in the moderately eutrophic Schohsee and involves a rapid increase in Secchi transparency, and a drop in chlorophyll and particulate organic carbon in size fractions < 35 .mu.m. Maxima of zooplankton biomass and community grazing rates (170% of volume cleared per day) coincided with the greatest transparency. The algal decline was not related to nutrient depletion or climatic events. Before the clear-water phase small phytoplankton contributed up to 88% of the primary production, but the contribution of large particles was more important after the zooplankton maximum. The effects of herbivory by zooplankton were examined in a series of time-over-lapping enclosure experiments. Concentrations of small (< 35 .mu.m) particles were always higher in the bags lacking zooplankton than in the controls. A mass development of small algae occurred in the zooplankton-free bags initiated during the clear-water phase, although the presence of zooplankton stimulated the growth of large (> 35 .mu.m) algae.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	1986	31	3					478	490		10.4319/lo.1986.31.3.0478	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1986.31.3.0478													WOS:A1986C863500003
J	BERRILL, M				BERRILL, M			DISTRIBUTION AND ECOLOGY OF CRAYFISH IN KAWARTHA LAKES REGION OF SOUTHERN ONTARIO	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The distribution, relative abundance and breeding cycles of 7 spp. of crayfish were examined in the Kawartha Lakes region of southern Ontario [Canada]. Of the 5 Orconectes spp., whose breeding cycles are remarkably synchronous, the recently introduced O. rusticus has become particularly successful and now occurs commonly in the widest range of habitats where it may be replacing both O. propinquus and O. virilis. O. obscurus, also recently introduced and as yet of very limited distribution, may become similarly successful. O. immunis is found commonly only in the most eutrophic of the lakes, and is therefore not involved in the competition occurring amongst the other 4 Orconectes spp. The 2 Cambarus spp. in the region, C. bartoni and C. robustus, are restricted to some of the swifter rapids and falls and to the rocky shores of some of the Shield lakes and, at least in part because their breeding cycles are organized differently, also appear uninvolved in direct competition with the Orconectes spp. The success of O. rusticus is likely to be due to a complex combination of behavioral and physiological characteristics.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1978	56	2					166	177		10.1139/z78-026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z78-026													WOS:A1978ER80300003

Alluvial cycles, climate, and puebloan settlement shifts near Zuni Salt Lake, New Mexico, USA	GEOARCHAEOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL												Twenty-seven C-14 dates from alluvial deposits and soils exposed in modern arroyos near Zuni Salt Lake, New Mexico, provide evidence for past episodes of piedmont and valley entrenchment by low-order ephemeral streams. We recognize two episodes of entrenchment at A.D. 900-1050 and A.D. 1300-1400 that correlate to other arroyo-cutting events in the region. Episodes of piedmont and valley entrenchment are followed by approximately 200-300 years of aggradation until arroyos are filled and shallow flooding with expansive sedimentation returns, completing an alluvial cycle. Many alluvial cycles appear synchronous across much of the southern Colorado Plateau and are likely linked to changes in climate and flood regime. Flooding on small basin drainages near Zuni Salt Lake is related to the Southwest summer monsoon, a meteorological event that is poorly linked to El Nino. Alluvial cycles on small basin drainages affected indigenous floodwater farming by locally lowering water tables and reducing irrigable area during phases of entrenchment and contributed to the aggregation of Puebloan communities on the southern Colorado Plateau in the A.D. 1300s.

Development of the Western Lake Erie Ecosystem Model (WLEEM): Application to connect phosphorus loads to cyanobacteria biomass	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Since the mid-1990s, Lake Erie has experienced re-eutrophication symptoms including harmful algal blooms in the western basin and summer hypoxia in the Central Basin. The 2012 Protocol for the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (GLWQA) required phosphorus objectives and management recommendations to be set for all the Great Lakes, beginning with Lake Erie. To inform setting revised loading targets for the Lake Erie portion of the GLWQA, modeling was performed. The development and application of one of those models, the Western Lake Erie Ecosystem Model (WLEEM), is described here. WLEEM is a three dimensional, fine-scale, process-based model that links hydrodynamic, sediment transport, and in-lake biogeochemical and ecological processes. WLEEM was applied here to assess system sensitivity to a range of variables, and ultimately to develop a robust phosphorus load cyanobacteria response relationship to determine a maximum load of total phosphorus from the Maumee River during the period of March July that would produce a mild cyanobacteria bloom (<7830 MT cyanobacteria biomass) in Western Lake Erie. The maximum total phosphorus load from the Maumee River for that period to produce a mild bloom was determined to be 890 metric tons. Given the natural variability of systems like this, tools like WLEEM used in a dynamic operational modeling mode, consistent tributary and lake monitoring, and ongoing research will be essential components of effective mitigation and science-based adaptive management of eutrophication in Lake Erie and other nutrient-impacted water bodies.

J	Schettler, G; Albéric, P				Schettler, Georg; Alberic, Patrick			Laghi di Monticchio (Southern Italy, Region Basilicata):: Genesis of sediments -: a geochemical study	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The sedimentation record of Lago Grande di Monticchio (LGM) is one of the most prominent paleoclimatic archives in the non-glaciated areas of Europe. However, the modern lake system has never been the subject of intense limnological studies. On the basis of hydrochemical water profiles, detailed investigations of sediment short cores and in situ pore water profiles from the littoral to the profundal zone, we elucidate spatial variations of sediment genesis within the lake basin and the importance of various depth sections for the lake's internal nutrient cycling. Sediments from the smaller meromictic Lago Piccolo di Montichio are discussed as a reference. Our study demonstrates: (i) distinctly higher sediment accumulation for the centre of the lake basin by focussing of the settling particle flux; (ii) decline of carbonate from the littoral to the profundal zones; (iii) non-synchronous change of calcite net-accumulation for various water depths; (iv) exceptionally high cation release from sediments covering the steeply inclining sector of the lake basin; (v) relatively constant dissolved silica concentrations in the pore waters (SiO2 similar to 42 mg/l) independent of water depth and sediment composition; (vi) influx of oxygen-bearing groundwater into the anoxic hypolimnion after heavy rainfall and the associated precipitation of Fe-oxihydroxides; (vii) higher release of NH4 by anaerobic degradation of organic matter at a water depth of 23 m than for sediments at a maximum water depth of 32 m, whereby the latter reflects the importance of seasonal sediment re-oxidation for anaerobic degradation of organic debris; (viii) although seasonal re-oxidation of sediments from various water depths is quite different, Oxygen Index values of LGM sediments fall in a small range, which reflects rapid microbial consumption of seasonally re-generated easily bio-degradable organic molecules.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				JUL	2008	40	1					529	556		10.1007/s10933-007-9180-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-007-9180-4													WOS:000257208600035

The model input values for the P and N loads, water temperature and irradiance were perturbed separately for every 4th day throughout 1 year. The aim was to find out whether 10% perturbation in the inputs on different instants would cause output variations of different character and magnitude. The simulation was realised with a deterministic 15th-order lumped parameter model destribing the P and N dynamics and the N-fixing cyanobacteria and other phytoplankton of Lake Kuortaneenjarvi, Finland. Sensitivity showed a very rapid increase in spring, followed by an exponential decline. Limiting factors and factors connected with ecological competition differed profoundly in their effect on algal production. An immediate collinear response in output was evoked by changes in limiting factors while a mirror-image type response with lags in competing algal groups was evoked by ecological factors. The response of cyanobacteria to the perturbations was 2 ot 5 times as great as that of the other algae.

However, the source area and triggering factors of this cascading geohazard event remained unclear. In this study, we combined satellite remote sensing, meteorological observations, numerical modeling, and post-event field investigation to comprehensively analyze its evolution processes and potential triggers. The remote sensing observations of terrain and landform changes suggest that the initial avalanche occurred on the southeastern flank of the glacier, releasing approximately 2.77 x 106 m3 of lithic and ice material. From our analysis, we suggest that the complex evolution process of this cascading geohazard event could be manifested as earthquake and hydrological triggers-* an initial rock-ice avalanche-* glacial debris flow-* triggered landslides-* landslide dam-* dammed lake. Our results suggest that the 2017 Ms. 6.9 Nyingchi earthquake, the unusually high meltwater from snow and ice during the abnormally warm and dry summer in 2018, and the short-duration intense rainfall (22 mm on 10 July) recorded one day before the event are the three main factors for the catastrophic event. These factors caused the rock-ice avalanche in the source zone and subsequently cascaded glacial debris flow and shallow landslides. This study highlights the urgent need for regular monitoring of high-risk glaciers, including anomalous changes in temperature and precipitation, and accelerated movements of glaciers due to earthquakes, especially in the SETP, where climate warming will be expected to intensify occurrences of such cascading geohazard events in the future.

Nur			Obruks, as giant collapse dolines caused by hypogenic karstification in central Anatolia, Turkey: analysis of likely formation processes	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Understanding the development of collapse dolines is crucially important because sudden formation of these landforms threatens property and life. Obruks are mega collapse dolines developed in the lacustrine Neogene carbonates of the Konya Closed Basin in central Turkey. These landforms with diameters and depths reaching several hundreds of meters are characterized by their cylindrical or inverted truncated cone shaped surface morphology and contain lakes if they intersect the local water table. Evaluations based on geological, geophysical, hydrogeological data and the groundwater's chemical and isotopic compositions suggest a hypogenic mechanism for the development of obruks. This process seems to be driven by the upward migration of a deep-seated carbon dioxide flux from an intrusive magmatic body. Presence of volcanogenic elements (i.e. Li and F) and remarkably high dissolved carbon dioxide ( log PCO2=10(-1) atm) in fresh groundwater, hydrothermal springs with elevated He contents (R/Ra=4.77), highly enriched carbon-13 isotopic composition of total dissolved inorganic carbon (C-13_TDIC=-1.12% V-PDB) in the regional groundwater and presence of widespread carbon dioxide discharges, constitute apparent evidence for the hypogenic fluid migration into the Neogene aquifer where enhanced dissolution due to mixing between the shallow-fresh and deep-saline groundwaters gives rise to obruk formation.

A new system designed for optical measurements beneath the ice was successfully tested. In the water body the vertical profiles of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), temperature and oxygen were mapped. The concentrations of optically active substances (dissolved organic matter, chlorophyll a, particles) were estimated for water samples and meltwater of ice samples. The PAR band albedo was 0.28-0.76 and transmittance was 1-52% for the ice/snow cover. The light field below ice was much more diffuse than in open water conditions. Euphotic depth was 0.1-5.5 m. The amount of yellow substance in lake ice is very small in comparison with the lake water; lake ice may contain a lot of particles, but their source is atmospheric fallout rather than the water body. In some lakes a depletion of oxygen was observed. There were considerable differences between the fresh and brackish water ice (structure, stratigraphy, amount of impurities), which influenced the underwater light field.					; Lepparanta, Matti/M-7507-2017	Sipelgas, Liis/0000-0003-1751-9522; Lepparanta, Matti/0000-0002-4754-5564													0029-1277						2003	34	3					245	266																WOS:000184041700006

Samples of water were taken from the lake (4 sampling points) and from wells dug within the catchment basin. The quality of water was analysed in May, June, August and November 2015. In the wells only in single cases was the level of chemical pollution found to exceed drinking water standards. However, in all samples the standard content of manganese was exceeded. In waters from the lake the concentrations of total phosphorus, which can contribute to eutrophication were recorded above the standard level. Both in waters from the lake and from the well a large count of meso-and psychrophiles and Coli and faecal coliforms as well as faecal Enterococci was found, which points to a high degree of contamination of the analysed waters with anthropogenic faeces. The phenomenon was observed to intensify in summer months, which can be associated with increased tourist traffic around the lake in this period.					; Jóźwiakowski, Krzysztof/AAN-1287-2021; Obroslak, Radomir/AAG-1921-2020; GRZYWNA, ANTONI/T-7179-2018; Kowalczyk-Juśko, Alina/GRF-4250-2022; Sosnowska, Bozena/U-4338-2018	Marzec, Michal/0000-0002-8338-0672; Kowalczyk-Jusko, Alina/0000-0002-1418-0386; Obroslak, Radomir/0000-0003-2622-2253; grzywna, antoni/0000-0002-7105-7173; Jozwiakowski, Krzysztof/0000-0001-6571-3093; Sosnowska, Bozena/0000-0001-9719-9359; Gizinska-Gorna, Magdalena/0000-0002-3943-0249; Mazur, Andrzej/0000-0002-0580-9672													2299-8993					SEP	2016	17	4					154	162		10.12911/22998993/64508	http://dx.doi.org/10.12911/22998993/64508													WOS:000416830500022

ADMAP Working Grp	Air and shipborne magnetic surveys of the Antarctic into the 21st century	TECTONOPHYSICS												The Antarctic geomagnetics' community remains very active in crustal anomaly mapping. More than 1.5 million line-km of new air- and shipborne data have been acquired over the past decade by the international community in Antarctica. These new data together with surveys that previously were not in the public domain significantly upgrade the ADMAP compilation. Aeromagnetic flights over East Antarctica have been concentrated in the Transantarctic Mountains, the Prince Charles Mountains - Lambert Glacier area, and western Dronning Maud Land (DML) - Coats Land. Additionally, surveys were conducted over Lake Vostok and the western part of Marie Byrd Land by the US Support Office for Aerogeophysical Research projects and over the Amundsen Sea Embayment during the austral summer of 2004/2005 by a collaborative US/UK aerogeophysical campaign. New aeromagnetic data over the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains (120,000 line-km), acquired within the IPY Antarctica's Gamburtsev Province project reveal fundamental geologic features beneath the East Antarctic Ice sheet critical to understanding Precambrian continental growth processes. Roughly 100,000 line-km of magnetic data obtained within the International Collaboration for Exploration of the Cryosphere through Aerogeophysical Profiling promises to shed light on subglacial lithology and identify crustal boundaries for the central Antarctic Plate. Since the 1996/97 season, the Alfred Wegener Institute has collected 90,000 km of aeromagnetic data along a 1200 km long segment of the East Antarctic coast over western DML Recent cruises by Australian, German, Japanese, Russian, British, and American researchers have contributed to long-standing studies of the Antarctic continental margin. Along the continental margin of East Antarctica west of Maud Rise to the George V Coast of Victoria Land, the Russian Polar Marine Geological Research Expedition and Geoscience Australia obtained 80,000 and 20,000 line-km, respectively, of integrated seismic, gravity and magnetic data. Additionally, US expeditions collected 128,000 line-km of shipborne magnetic data in the Ross Sea sector. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A.; Shah, Rayees; Achyuthan, Hema			Reconstruction of Paleoclimate and Environmental Fluctuations Since the Early Holocene Period Using Organic Matter and C:N Proxy Records: A Review	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA												In this review, the shifts in organic matter (OM) accumulation and C:N ratios in lake sediments to reconstruct paleoclimate and paleo-environmental changes since the early Holocene period are presented. The C:N proxy data of total OM reflect wet climatic conditions during early Holocene (10 to 8.2 kyrs BP) due to enhanced southwest monsoon. This was followed by intermittent arid conditions during the mid and late Holocene period (8.2 to 2.8 kyr BP). Enhanced values of C:N ratio during middle to late Holocene (7.8-2.3 kyrs B.P) indicate periods with lower lake levels and minimum precipitation, while decreased C:N ratio point to stronger SW monsoon and expansion of the lakes. Further, C:N and delta C-13 results from the lake sediments reveal a detailed and continuous paleo-environmental changes in the relative sources of OM (allochthonous vs autochthonous). Proxy records using such natural archives have also been utilized to reconstruct past extreme events and environmental changes around the lake systems, such as causes for lake desiccation, hydrographic changes, alternations between C-3 and C-4 vegetation and historical disturbances in the catchment area since the early-late Holocene period coupled with the Indian summer monsoon.					; Achyuthan, Hema/AAA-6898-2022; Lone, Aasif/AAA-2772-2021	Shah, Rayees Ahmad/0000-0002-3052-6391; LONE, AASIF/0000-0002-1517-2038; Achyuthan, Hema/0000-0001-5495-4115													0016-7622	0974-6889				FEB	2018	91	2					209	214		10.1007/s12594-018-0837-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12594-018-0837-6													WOS:000426293100011
J	Hawley, N; Muzzi, RW				Hawley, N; Muzzi, RW			Observations of nepheloid layers made with an autonomous vertical profiler	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												An autonomous vertical profiler was deployed at a site in 55 m of water in southern Lake Michigan during the late summer of 2001. Profiles of temperature and water transparency were made hourly between I and 40 meters above the bottom for about 23 days (568 profiles). The temperature observations show that the depth of the thermocline changed in response to both near-inertial internal waves and to upwelling and downwelling events. The transparency measurements show the presence of both an intermediate nepheloid layer located near the base of the thermocline and a benthic nepheloid layer at the bottom. The layers were usually separated by a region of clearer water, but during one upwelling event they merged together. Changes in both the intermediate nepheloid layer and the benthic nepheloid layer occurred in response to changes in the thermocline depth. The total amount of material suspended in both the bottom 40 m and in the benthic nepheloid layer varied by over 50%. The source of the additional material appears to be local resuspension events caused either directly or indirectly by near-inertial internal waves.																			0380-1330						2003	29	1					124	133		10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70421-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70421-3													WOS:000181997000012

Cattail (Typha latifolia) was the most prominent plant food item in the diet of muskrats. Feedbed surveys indicated that muskrat foraging bouts decreased from the lakeshore denning area with distance into the fen. This pattern of reduced feeding activity was associated with declines in both open water travel routes (i.e., sluiceways) and cattail biomass. Muskrats preferentially selected the core of the cattails. Tissue assays showed core tissue to contain low amounts of lignin and only moderate levels of celluose, suggesting that muskrats were selecting the plant part most easily digested. Nitrogen and phosphorus levels in cattail samples from all sampling locations in the fen were similar, suggesting that muskrats concentrated their foraging movements for reasons other than maximizing diet quality. These data suggest that predator avoidance behavior strongly influenced muskrats foraging movements, and that muskrats attempted to maximize feeding efficiency within the constraint of access to available open water escape routes.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				JUN	1990	68	6					1163	1167		10.1139/z90-172	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z90-172													WOS:A1990DP42300015

Ultraplankton (0.45-10 .mu.m) dominated plankton numbers and metabolic activity in both systems. An increase in photolithotrophy during the fall was due to an increase in the activity, numbers ml-1 or both, of specific phytoplankters rather than an increase in the percentage of viable cells. Many of the most abundant species were not the most productive in terms of inorganic C fixation. Single species dominated total inorganic C fixation in both systems. Light-mediated uptake of [3H]glucose was extensive in Flathead Lake [Montana, USA]; light bottle uptake averaged 365% of dark bottle uptake. Autoradiographs indicated that bacteria were responsible for the observed light-mediated uptake of [3H]glucose in both lakes. Chemoheterotrophy dominated all Lake Texoma samples. Simultaneous in situ NaH14CO3 and [3H]glucose incubations in Lake Texoma revealed an ability of Oscillatoria agardhii (Gomont) to be mixotrophic as well as photoheterotrophic.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1982	27	3					440	454		10.4319/lo.1982.27.3.0440	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1982.27.3.0440													WOS:A1982NS48100005

In the Himalayan region, an earthquake can be seen as an agent that triggers other natural hazards such as landslides, and lake outburst floods due to moraine-dam breach. Such events occur due to alteration in the shear strength properties of soil triggered by a tectonic event. In this study, an attempt has been made to investigate the potential of interferogram and coherence derived from Sentinel-1 SLC to identify the changes caused by MW5.7 earthquake (20-Mar-2020) around the Lake Dingmu, Tibet. The pre- and co-seismic interferogram and coherence images for the surrounding region of Lake Dingmu have been generated. Subsequently, the decreased coherence around the lake periphery have been investigated for soil liquefaction/cyclic mobility through Temporal difference liquefaction index (TDLI) using Landsat-8 OLI. The TDLI detects the changes in the soil moisture content due to the earthquake event. The results of Sentinel-1 SLC data corroborate well with the results of optical remote sensing data. It is evident from the analysis that a significant amount of changes occurred due to the earthquake. However, the topography makes the lake very stable.					; Bharti, Rishikesh/S-5002-2019	Bharti, Rishikesh/0000-0002-6252-9909; 													2153-6996		978-1-6654-2792-0				2022							2522	2525		10.1109/IGARSS46834.2022.9883036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS46834.2022.9883036													WOS:000920916602180
J	Rekolainen, S; Mitikka, S; Vuorenmaa, J; Johansson, M				Rekolainen, S; Mitikka, S; Vuorenmaa, J; Johansson, M			Rapid decline of dissolved nitrogen in Finnish lakes	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Since 1960s, phosphorus (P) has been considered to be most often the limiting factor for algal growth in freshwater lakes. Due to that, pollution control measures have been targeted to reduce P loading to lakes. In many countries these efforts have been successful: the P loadings, particularly through municipal waste waters have been reduced substantially, which has resulted in reduced P concentration of lake waters, and improvements in ecological quality of numerous lakes. Nitrogen reductions in wastewater treatment plants have started only in very recent years, and usually only in cities along the seashore. Analysis of the long-term lake monitoring data in Finland show a sharp decline of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN, expressed as a sum of NO2-N, NO3-N and NH4-N) during the 1990s. Most of these lakes are oligotrophic lakes with low human impact. Due to this, the relative contribution of air-borne nitrogen loading (deposition directly to the lake surface) is often higher than in lakes located in densely populated or in intensive agricultural regions. The DIN deposition monitoring results show approximately a 40% reduction during the same period as the decreasing DIN trend is observed in lakes. These trends in deposition can probably be explained by reductions in nitrogen emissions in Europe, in connection to air pollution control conventions, and in Eastern Europe also in connection to economical collapse at the beginning of 1990s. In many of the lakes with a significant decreasing trend, DIN concentrations in late summer are approaching very low levels (< 20 mu g 1(-1)) indicating that nitrogen is possibly limiting algal growth at least seasonally. The observed trends are an example of how pollution control measures may result in a quick response, in this case unexpected, though not necessarily undesirable. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

J	Bhardwaj, LK; Jindal, T				Bhardwaj, Laxmi Kant; Jindal, Tanu			Persistent Organic Pollutants in Lakes of Grovnes Peninsula at Larsemann Hill Area, East Antarctica	EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT												Due to various scientific expeditions and tourism, there has been an increase in anthropogenic activities during the past 2-3 decades in Antarctica. Moreover, global contamination due to several freshly introduced chemicals like pesticides is on use since the previous century and even several issues contribute to pollution in Antarctica. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are persistent in nature and include some pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins. Due to volatile nature, these pollutants are transported across the earth by the "grasshopper effect". During a 34th Indian Scientific Expedition to Antarctica in the austral summer of December 2014 to February 2015, a total of forty-five water samples from fifteen different lakes was collected from Grovnes peninsula, Larsemann Hill, East Antarctica. In these samples, twenty-seven compounds of POPs were estimated. POP(')s level was found in the water samples from 10.00 to 75.00 pg/mL in different lakes. Occurrence of p,p '-DDT was identified in all lakes, but maximum concentration was found in L1E NG lake. This research confirms that Grovnes peninsula has a trace level of POPs and it is the initial state and needs to investigate further to preserve the pristine Antarctica. This manuscript provides an overview of the available sample preparation methods, analytical techniques and the concentration of POPs in the lakes of the Grovnes peninsula in a Larsemann Hill area, East Antarctica.

In the present study, size at age, von Bertalanffy growth parameters, population age distributions, and precision and bias in age assessment based on scales and sectioned otoliths were compared between ecotypes and among populations of Rainbow Smelt. To compare the ecotypes, we collected spawning adults from four anadromous and three landlocked populations in Maine during spring 2014. A significant bias was identified in only one of four scale comparisons but in four of seven otolith comparisons; however, a comparable level of precision was indicated. Anadromous populations had larger and more variable size at age and von Bertalanffy growth parameters than landlocked fish. Populations were composed of ages 1-4; six populations were dominated by age-2 or age-3 individuals, and one population was dominated by age-1 fish. These data suggest the presence of considerable plasticity among populations. A latitudinal gradient was observed in the anadromous Rainbow Smelt, which may show signs of population stress at the southern extent of their distribution.

J	Weldeab, S; Menke, V; Schmiedl, G				Weldeab, Syee; Menke, Valerie; Schmiedl, Gerhard			The pace of East African monsoon evolution during the Holocene	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												African monsoon precipitation experienced a dramatic change in the course of the Holocene. The pace with which the African monsoon shifted from a strong early to middle to a weak late Holocene is critical for our understanding of climate dynamics, hydroclimate-vegetation interaction, and shifts of prehistoric human settlements, yet it is controversially debated. On the basis of planktonic foraminiferal Ba/Ca time series from the eastern Mediterranean Sea, here we present a proxy record of Nile River runoff that provides a spatially integrated measure of changes in East African monsoon (EAM) precipitation. The runoff record indicates a markedly gradual middle to late Holocene EAM transition that lasted over 3500years. The timing and pace of runoff change parallels those of insolation and vegetation changes over the Nile basin, indicating orbitally forced variation of insolation as the main EAM forcing and the absence of a nonlinear precipitation-vegetation feedback. A tight correspondence between a threshold level of Nile River runoff and the timing of occupation/abandonment of settlements suggests that along with climate changes in the eastern Sahara, the level of Nile River and intensity of summer floods were likely critical for the habitability of the Nile Valley (Egypt).

Although other transformations are certainly important, they are nevertheless driven by the decomposition of organic carbon both in the water column and in the sediments. Rates of transport of particulate organic carbon to the hypolimnion and sediments were estimated using sediment traps. Corrections for sediment resuspension were necessary even during the summer period when the lake is stratified. Particulate organic carbon concentrations in the hypolimnion were partially independent of short-term variations in chlorophyll concentration. The net downflux of carbon to the hypolimnion appeared less than that required to support the observed oxygen depletion. Sediment resuspension accounted for much of the particulate material caught by the sediment traps in the central basin. It is concluded that organic material stored in the surficial sediments is made available to the water column through frequent resuspension. Of total phosphorus in the trap samples, an average of 42% was potentially bioavailable (NaOH extraction).																			0380-1330						1987	13	4					709	723		10.1016/S0380-1330(87)71685-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(87)71685-2													WOS:A1987M110000024
J	TREWIN, NH; RICE, CM				TREWIN, NH; RICE, CM			STRATIGRAPHY AND SEDIMENTOLOGY OF THE DEVONIAN RHYNIE CHERT LOCALITY	SCOTTISH JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY												Recent drilling in the vicinity of the Rhynie chert locality in the Rhynie outlier of Lower Old Red Sandstone allows a local stratigraphic succession to be established. A basal lithic sandstone and pebbly sandstone unit of local derivation rests unconformably on basement, and was deposited in an alluvial fan environment. An andesitic lava flow, now highly altered, overlies the pre-lava sandstone, but is of limited lateral extent. The lava is succeeded by tuffaceous sandstones and shales which grade upwards into a shale-dominated sequence, with greatly diminished volcanic input. The volcanic debris is of local origin, probably derived from eroding tuff cones, but the general depositional environment was an alluvial plain with ephemeral lakes. The Rhynie cherts are siliceous sinters, comprising more than 10 plant-bearing beds and 2 non-plant-bearing cherts and are equivalent to part of the post-lava tuffaceous sandstone and shale sequence. A second plant-bearing chert, together with evidence of a hot-spring vent, has been discovered 700 m from the original locality. The borehole evidence casts some doubt on the validity of the previously accepted stratigraphy of the Rhynie outlier, particularly with regard to the stratigraphic position of the Dryden Flags and Shales.																			0036-9276						1992	28		1				37	47		10.1144/sjg28010037	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/sjg28010037													WOS:A1992KG94200004

In this paper, a succession model for vegetation and burial depth of groundwater level was constructed through field survey, and was used along with numeric simulation to predict the change in burial depth of groundwater level in the study area under exploitation and to analyze and predict the vegetation succession rules and processes. It is believed from the study that, while groundwater level falls constantly, the burial depth of groundwater level will increase gradually, and succession will occur gradually from aquatic vegetation to mesophytic and xerophytic vegetations, from Carex L. and Iris ensata Thunb shoaly lands to Achnatherum splendens shoaly lands, from Salix psammophila shrubs to Artemisia desterorum Spreng shrubs, and from Populus simonii to Salix matsudana.																			1022-6680		978-3-03785-416-7				2012	518-523						4315	4320		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.518-523.4315	http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.518-523.4315													WOS:000313845902056

The results indicate that small, low nutrient dune ponds can have a relevant role for carbon storage and processing, especially in the limestone areas. Despite the low percentage of organic matter in the sediment and water nutrient concentrations, most of the ponds had supersaturated carbon dioxide partial pressure levels with concentrations in half of them greater than the mean global value for lakes. Concentrations gradually decreased from old to newly restored ponds and with the presence of submerged plants. Carbon content was greater in temporary ponds. DOC was half of the mean global value for lakes. Particulate forms of nutrients and dissolved inorganic carbon predominated. Organic matter was a key variable for storage of nutrients and carbon in the sediment. Flooding of the ponds significantly reduced total organic carbon in the sediment by about 60%, but did not change significantly the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus. However, about 25% of organic matter and 37% of nitrogen accumulated in the sediment during consecutive summer droughts. Benthic algae incorporated part of the sediment nutrient pool after flooding.

J	Gunnarson, BE				Gunnarson, BE			Lake level changes indicated by dendrochronology on subfossil pine, jamtland, central Scandinavian mountains, Sweden	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Not only do high-latitude tree-ring data reveal minor and major Holocene climatic variation, but the distribution in time of subfossil trees provides information about former tree-line fluctuation. Over 152 samples of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) were collected and measured from lake Lilla Rortjarnen, situated close to the present treeline. Five floating chronologies were built spanning 498 B.C.-A.D. 19, A.D. 50-390, A.D. 431-884, A.D. 946-1256, and A.D. 1337-1865. The floating chronologies were crossdated with a dendrochronology from Tornetrask. No trees were dated from 20-49 A.D., 391-430 A.D., 885-945 A.D., and 1257-1336. A.D.. The temporal distribution of pines in the lake suggests periods of intensive germination. with each phase occurring within 80 to 100 yr from the beginning of each floating chronology. At the end of each phase higher lake levels drowned trees close to the shore. Both the existence and the preservation of the dead pines is likely to have been controlled by changes in lake level.

Foraminiferal community response to seasonal anoxia in Lake Grevelingen (the Netherlands)	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Over the last decades, hypoxia in marine coastal environments has become more and more widespread, prolonged and intense. Hypoxic events have large consequences for the functioning of benthic ecosystems. In severe cases, they may lead to complete anoxia and the presence of toxic sulfides in the sediment and bottom-water, thereby strongly affecting biological compartments of benthic marine ecosystems. Within these ecosystems, benthic foraminifera show a high diversity of ecological responses, with a wide range of adaptive life strategies. Some species are particularly resistant to hypoxia-anoxia, and consequently it is interesting to study the whole foraminiferal community as well as speciesspecific responses to such events. Here we investigated the temporal dynamics of living benthic foraminiferal communities (recognised by CellTracker (TM) Green) at two sites in the saltwater Lake Grevelingen in the Netherlands. These sites are subject to seasonal anoxia with different durations and are characterised by the presence of free sulfide (H2S) in the uppermost part of the sediment. Our results indicate that foraminiferal communities are impacted by the presence of H2S in their habitat, with a stronger response in the case of longer exposure times. At the deepest site (34m), in summer 2012, 1 to 2 months of anoxia and free H2S in the surface sediment resulted in an almost complete disappearance of the foraminiferal community. Conversely, at the shallower site (23 m), where the duration of anoxia and free H2S was shorter (1 month or less), a dense foraminiferal community was found throughout the year except for a short period after the stressful event. Interestingly, at both sites, the foraminiferal community showed a delayed response to the onset of anoxia and free H2S, suggesting that the combination of anoxia and free H2S does not lead to increased mortality, but rather to strongly decreased reproduction rates. At the deepest site, where highly stressful conditions prevailed for 1 to 2 months, the recovery time of the community takes about half a year. In Lake Grevelingen, Elphidium selseyense and Elphidium magellanicum are much less affected by anoxia and free H2S than Ammonia sp. T6. We hypothesise that this is not due to a higher tolerance for H2S, but rather related to the seasonal availability of food sources, which could have been less suitable for Ammonia sp. T6 than for the elphidiids.					richirt, julien/GSD-9619-2022; Schweizer, Magali/F-9358-2014; Slomp, Caroline/A-9406-2012; Jorissen, Frans/D-2392-2009; Meysman, Filip/C-9585-2009; Langlet, Dewi/F-4427-2014	Richirt, Julien/0000-0003-3618-836X; Meysman, Filip/0000-0001-5334-7655; Slomp, Caroline/0000-0002-7272-0109; Langlet, Dewi/0000-0002-2201-0897; 													1726-4170	1726-4189				MAR 20	2020	17	6					1415	1435		10.5194/bg-17-1415-2020	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-1415-2020													WOS:000521594000002

Ethan; Son, Kyongho; Hung, Fengwei; Tidwell, Vincent			Impact of climate change on adaptive management decisions in the face of water scarcity	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Reoccurring drought through the early 2000s has caused a serious water scarcity issue in the Colorado River Basin. Previous modeling studies have focused on the impact of climate change without considering the adaptive behaviors of farmers and under-utilized Indian water rights. In this paper, we use a coupled agent-based water resource model (ABM) to investigate how the adaptive decisions of farmers can affect water resource management under both climate change impacts and fully utilized Indian water right conditions. We used five General Circulation Model projections with RCP8.5 scenarios for the study. The results of farm-level decision-making showed different responses in irrigated areas that were changing due to climate change impact. While winter precipitation changes might partially explain the behavior changes, no specific pattern could be concluded based on their location. Also, farmers' responses about annual water diversion showed more significant inter-year variation compared to irrigated areas. Basin-level metrics showed that climate change impacts will generally worsen water scarcity issues as measured in Navajo Reservoir storage, flow to Lake Powell, and instream flow requirement. But these basin-level water scarcity metrics cannot reflect individual farm-level impacts under climate change, which is why modeling the bottom-up management actions is necessary. When the under-utilized Indian water rights are fully used, it is more likely to trigger the shortage sharing agreement due to the higher tribal water depletion. Evaluation of model uncertainty and a more realistic setup for adaptive actions under drought contingency plans are suggested for future research.					; Son, Kyongho/I-1427-2019; Yang, Yi-Chen/D-5049-2012; Hung, Fengwei/AAL-3332-2020	Tidwell, Vincent/0000-0002-4954-897X; Son, Kyongho/0000-0003-0288-6522; Hung, Fengwei/0000-0003-1996-2536													0022-1694	1879-2707				SEP	2020	588								125015	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125015													WOS:000568826300030

The identification of this strain was established using the morphological, cultural, physiological, biochemical properties and 16S rRNA sequence. The organism was found to have morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics typical of streptomycetes. Phylogenetic analysis based on the almost complete 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that the strain NEAE-115 belongs to the genus Streptomyces and consistently falls into a clade together with Streptomyces niveoruber strain NRRL B-2724, Streptomyces polychromogenes strain EAAG77, Streptomyces nashvillensis strain 1534, Streptomyces roseoviridis strain JS-9 and Streptomyces venezuelae strain JS-11. 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities between NEAE-115 and above mentioned type strains were between 80 and 81%. The comparative study on the basis of morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics of the strain NEAE-115 in relation to its closest phylogenetic neighbours of the genus Streptomyces revealed that the strain NEAE-115 represents a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces brollosae NEAE-115 is proposed and its sequencing product was deposited in the GenBank database under accession number KJ410229.

An iodine mass-balance for Lake Constance, Germany: Insights into iodine speciation changes and fluxes	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Lake Constance is one of Europe's largest oligotrophic lakes and provides a water source for more than 4.5 million people in Germany and Switzerland. We present here a 12 month study on iodine concentrations, speciation and fluxes to and from the lake to gain a quantitative understanding of the limnic iodine cycle. Monthly water samples were obtained from all major tributaries (14) and the outflow to construct a mass-balance model. Sediment traps were also deployed in the lake for two years at two different stations. Total soluble iodine (TSI) in aqueous samples were analysed by ICP-MS and speciation (iodide, iodate and soluble organically bound iodine, SOT) by ion chromatography-ICP-MS. Iodine concentrations in the Alpine tributaries (1-2 mu g l(-1)) decreased over the summer months due to increasing proportions of snow and glacial melt water from the Alps, while iodine levels in the lowland rivers (similar to 2-10 mu g l(-1)) increased over the summer. Deposition of TS1 to the catchment (16,340 kg I yr(-1)) was similar to the TSI out-flux by rivers (16,000 kg I yr(-1)). By also including the particulate riverine iodine flux out of the catchment (similar to 12,350 kg I yr(-1)) it is shown that the catchment is a net source of iodine, with the highest particulate fluxes coming from the Alpine rivers: The total TSI flux to the lake was 16,770 kg I yr(-1), the largest proportion coming from the Alpenrhein (43%), followed by the Schussen (8%) and Bregenzer Ach (7.7%). Overall the mass-balance for TSI in the lake was negative, with more iodine flowing out of the lake than in (-2050 kg I yr(-1); 12% of TSI in-flux). To maintain mass-balance, 8.8 mu g I m(-2) d(-1) from the Obersee and 23 mu g I m(-2) d(-1) from the Untersee must be released from the sediments into the water column. Thus, in comparison with the total iodine flux to the sediments measured by the sediment traps (4762-8075 kg I yr(-1)), up to 39% of the deposited iodine may be mobilised back into the lake. SOI was the dominant iodine fraction entering the lake, with a total flux of 10,290 kg I yr(-1) (64% of TSI input), followed by iodate (3120 kg I yr(-1)) and iodide (2760 kg I yr(-1)). Net formation of SOI from iodide and iodate was also noted within the lake, with an estimated production of 6560 kg I yr(-1), suggesting a strong role for biology in iodine cycling. In conclusion, organically bound iodine was the dominant iodine species in aqueous and solid phases in Lake Constance, despite low DOC concentrations (<2 mg l(-1)), and thus is expected to play an important role in iodine cycling in most freshwater environments.

L-1) and zinc (209-253 .mu.g .cntdot. L-1) and from control lakes. In all cases the fish reached maturity between 4 and 6 yr of age, and until 6 yr of age there was no differences in length or weight of fish collected from control and contaminated lakes. After this age, fish from contaminated sites were significantly smaller and shorter than those from control sites. In addition, female sucker from contaminated lakes failed to exhibit significant increases in either length or weight after the age of maturity. The fish from contaminated lakes also exhibited decreases in egg size and fecundity, no significant increases in fecundity with age, and an increased incidence of spawning failure. The failure of female fish to grow significantly after maturity, and the decreased energetic commitment to reproduction, suggests that the food base in the contaminated lakes was limiting the performance of the female sucker. These fish exhibited decreased muscle lipid stores, decreased serum lipid levels during the postspawning period, and an apparent decrease in visceral lipid stores during the autumn. There was no effect of collection site on body stores of liver glycogen, liver lipids, serum triglycerides, or total serum cholesterol. It is known that several major food groups were missing from the sediments of contaminated lakes and that sediments under water deeper than 5 m may be incapable of supporting macroinvertebrates. Most of the alterations in sucker growth and reproduction appear to be related to nutritional deficiencies as a result of the chronic effects of elevated sediment metals on the food base of the sucker.

Implications of water column ammonium uptake and regeneration for the nitrogen budget in temperate, eutrophic Missisquoi Bay, Lake Champlain (Canada/USA)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Assessing ammonium (NH4 (+)) availability in aquatic systems requires accurate concentration and turnover rate data. Water column NH4 (+) regeneration, potential NH4 (+) uptake, and nitrogen (N) fixation rates were measured in Missisquoi Bay, Lake Champlain, to help constrain internal N dynamics affecting phytoplankton community structure and cyanobacteria (Cy) blooms. Cyanobacteria dominated phytoplankton biomass during occasional summer bloom periods, but low or undetectable N-2 fixation rates and low heterocyte abundances suggested that N fixing cyanobacteria did not rely on atmospheric N-2. Light/dark incubations revealed that photosynthetic and dark NH4 (+) uptake generally were balanced, highlighting the importance of bacterial uptake. Our results suggest that phytoplankton were not controlled by nutrients from the "bottom-up"; rather, water column N dynamics responded to phytoplankton patterns. Basin-scale water column NH4 (+) regeneration rates were about 700,000 mol N day(-1) (9.8 t N day(-1)), which is almost twice the estimated N load from tributaries, and suggests a primary role for water column N regeneration in supporting primary production. Comparisons of basin-scale NH4 (+) regeneration and demand imply that primary production is not sustained fully by combined water column regeneration and tributary N inputs; thus, future research should constrain additional sources and sinks affecting N balance in this and other aquatic systems.

However, the limited knowledge of the interconnections between weathering and climate impedes our understanding of its role in the evolution of the Earth's climate. The Tibetan Plateau is the world's highest and largest plateau and the source of water resources for nearly half of the world's population, it has become a key area for paleoclimate research due to its influence on the atmospheric circulation system and sensitivity to climate change. Herein, we present a major and trace elements-based record of chemical weathering from sediments in the Hurleg Lake, northeastern Tibetan Plateau, over the past 14.1 cal kyr BP. As showed in elements deduced indexes, Hurleg Lake sediments were mainly originated from felsic rocks. Besides, the sediments source remained largely unchanged in the last 14.1 cal kyr BP and the sediments underwent only minimal recycling, and not affected by diagenesis and metasomatism, thus preserving a record of the chemical weathering intensity in the lake catchment. The chemical weathering indexes presented consistent trends and were in good agreement with the variation of delta(13)Ccarb in authigenic carbonate derived from the same sequence. Chemical weathering intensified during 14.1 similar to 12.5, 11.1 similar to 8.7, 7.2 similar to 4.8 cal kyr BP, and after 3.5 cal kyr BP, when the climate was warm and/or humid, but weakened in cold-dry intervals of 12.5 similar to 11.1, 8.7 similar to 7.2, and 4.8 similar to 3.5 cal kyr BP. The wet intervals correspond to periods of intensification of the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) or Westerlies. Furthermore, the climate changes in the study area are also typically linked to high- and low-latitude factors that influence global climate conditions, such as insolation changes, the North Atlantic ice-rafting event, and Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) migrations. The "unusual " cold-dry episode in the 4.8 similar to 3.5 cal kyr BP possibly dominated by both Westerlies and EASM, the result supports the point that both high and low latitude feedbacks played an important role in modulating Hurleg Lake clod-dry climate during 4.8 to 3.5 cal kyr BP. Our records suggest that the climate evolution on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau response to global climate change sensitively, and the possibility that variabilities in the ITCZ might be instrumental in understanding high to lowlatitude climate linkages on a global scale.

J	Liu, L; Cai, LL; Zhang, R				Liu, Lu; Cai, Lanlan; Zhang, Rui			Co-existence of freshwater and marine T4-like myoviruses in a typical subtropical estuary	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on Earth and play an important role in microbial community dynamics and biogeochemical cycling, yet their ecological characteristics in estuarine ecosystems are unclear. Here, virioplankton communities in a typical subtropical estuary, the Jiulong River estuary (JRE) in China, were investigated. The abundance of virioplankton ranged from 1.01 +/- 0.05 x 10(7) to 1.62 +/- 0.09 x 10(7) particles mL(-1) in JRE, and the population size of viruses was correlated with temperature and nutrient levels. Three tailed viral morphotypes (myovirus, siphovirus and podovirus) were observed. Phylogenetic analysis showed that most of the g23 sequences in the JRE fell into three previously established groups (Marine, Paddy and Lake Groups) and two potential Estuary Groups. This demonstrates the co-existence of typical freshwater and marine T4-like myoviruses in the estuarine ecosystem, suggesting the movement of viruses and their hosts among biomes. Additionally, the spatial variation of g23 sequences suggests a geographic distribution pattern of T4-like myoviruses in the JRE, which might be shaped by the environmental gradient and/or their host distribution. These results provide valuable insights into the abundance, diversity and distribution patterns of virioplankton, as well as the factors influencing them, in subtropical estuarine ecosystems.					; Cai, Lanlan/HKE-7665-2023	Cai, Lanlan/0000-0002-1084-2848; 													0168-6496	1574-6941				NOV	2017	93	11							fix119	10.1093/femsec/fix119	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fix119								29099976					WOS:000416389100001

FOLIA GEOBOTANICA & PHYTOTAXONOMICA					Symposium on Adaptation Strategies in Wetland Plants - Links Between Ecology and Physiology	SEP 07-10, 1994	TREBON, CZECH REPUBLIC					Reed rhizomes from four habitats differing in soil nitrogen availability were collected and analysed for carbohydrate content during one year. Rhizomes collected from sediments where nitrate was the prevailing form of available nitrogen accumulated predominantly starch. On the other hand, rhizomes buried in sediments rich in ammonium contained predominantly sucrose. These observations together with the fact that ammonium stimulates the activity of enzymes involved in degradation of starch suggest that ammonium affects starch storage by inducing conversion of starch into sucrose. During spring when sprouting takes place, the rates of sucrose or starch mobilization differed remarkably, the sucrose in rhizomes buried in ammonium-rich sediments being depleted much faster than the starch in rhizomes at ammonium-poor habitats. The consequent reduction of total carbohydrate content in rhizomes at ammonium-rich habitats places the plants in a vulnerable situation. Eutrophication and reed decline are postulated to be events causally related via toxicity of ammonium, of which considerable amounts are microbiologically released from decaying organic matter in reed beds under excessive nutrient supply.

The Los Humeros Geothermal Field (LHGF) is ranked third in terms of generated capacity, and in the last decade its installed capacity has doubled (up to 95.0 MW). Further increases in the geothermal power generation capacity in Mexico are planned, and thus the LHGF warrants further examination. The development and growth phases of any geothermal project must start from an awareness of the conceptual model of the natural system studied. The recharge mechanism, feeding zones, and fluid flow-path must be identified, along with the estimation of the temperature at the productive level and of phase separation (liquid - steam). To accomplish this, detailed fluid geochemical surveys were carried out in June 2017 and March 2018, in which 57 and 87 samples were collected, respectively, from cold and thermal springs, water wells and maar lakes located around and inside the LHGF. Samples from fumaroles inside the producing area were also collected for the first time, together with fluid from re-injection wells. The presence of a meteoric component, which plays an important role at the regional scale, is confirmed by the chemical and isotope data, and its contribution in terms of recharge may be higher than previously assumed. The Sierra Madre Oriental, on the west side of the LHGF, is characterized by widespread outcrops of limestone belonging to the same geological formation as those at the bottom of the LHGF. The isotope composition (delta D and delta O-18, respectively -77.3 parts per thousand and -10.50 parts per thousand for the hypothetical Infiltration Water IW) is similar to that observed in cold springs located in the Sierra Madre Oriental, and from this the evolution of isotopes in the liquid-rock-steam system during water-rock interaction and phase separation processes can be modelled. Thus, the experimental data obtained for natural gas emissions (fumarolic condensates) and for geothermal fluids can be reproduced. These findings suggest that geothermal fluids in the LHGF are likely to be derived from meteoric water infiltrating (IW) the limestone outcrops of the Sierra Madre Oriental. During their flow-path, the infiltrating waters exchange isotopes at a high temperature with the crustal rocks, which have a much higher O-18/O-16 ratio, resulting in a shift towards higher delta O-18 (-4.35 parts per thousand +/- 1) as the water O exchanges with rock O. The vapor phase can be separated from this deep water (DW) and it is discharged from the fumarolic effluents of Loma Blanca. Single Step Vapor Separation (SSVS) and Continuous Steam Separation processes (CSS) were modelled using stable isotopes of water. The results of geochemical modeling agree with available data for geothermal liquids discharged from several geothermal wells, suggesting that steam separation may be interpreted either as SSVS or CSS. Other processes can affect the chemistry and isotope composition of geothermal fluids (e.g. phase segregation, gas exchange, contributions from magmatic-volcanic deep fluids and re-injection fluids). The proposed conceptual model is consistent with both the geochemical data and the geological setting, and provides a useful point of reference for examining the fluid flow-path and geochemical processes active in the LHGF, at least at a general level. An involvement of magmatic-volcanic deep fluids in the feeding mechanism of the geothermal system cannot be excluded at priori, but the regional meteoric end-member is supported by the data and it seems the most important component.

Initial characterization by gas chromatography revealed that the selected biomaterial is one of the natural sources of eucalyptol. It constituted high concentrations of reducing compounds (iron, phenols and flavonoids). Batch studies revealed that the biosorbent (5 g L-1) was able to remove 97-99.9% of 250 mg L-1 Cr(VI) at wide-ranging pH (2-10) and temperature (24-48 degrees C). Adsorption kinetics was well described using the pseudo second -order kinetic model, while the equilibrium adsorption data were interpreted in terms of the Langmuir isotherm model. The monolayer adsorption capacity was 62.5 mg g(-1). Both inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry and liquid chromatography analyses of the aqueous and solid phases revealed that the mechanism of Cr(VI) removal was `adsorption-coupled reduction'. Scanning electron microscope, infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analyses of the biosorbent before and after adsorption also confirmed that both adsorption and reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) followed by complexation onto functional groups of the active surface contributed to the removal of Cr(VI) from aqueous solution. The selected biomaterial effectively (99.9%) removed Cr(VI) in lake and sea water samples, highlighting its potential for remediating Cr(VI) in real environmental conditions.

J	Matisoff, G; Carson, ML				Matisoff, Gerald; Carson, Mary Lou			Sediment resuspension in the Lake Erie nearshore	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A decline in water quality in Lake Erie during the last decade, despite increased efforts to limit nutrient loading, may be better understood by examining internal processes in the lake. We employed Be-7, Pb-210 and Cs-137 measurements of suspended matter in tributaries, in the lake water column, in atmospheric precipitation, in sediment traps and in bottom sediments collected in June and August/September 2011 to estimate the fraction of the suspended matter that is resuspended from the bottom. Mass balances on Be-7 and Pb-210 using sediment trap material indicated that at the nearshore site similar to 83-94% of suspended matter in the water column was resuspended bottom sediment, while, offshore, resuspended sediment made up only similar to 62-75%. A mass balance using the Be-7/Pb-210 ratio for each sediment source indicated that resuspension of bottom sediment accounted for 52-97% of the suspended material in the nearshore and from 53 to 86% of the suspended matter in the offshore and was greater after the fall overturn. The amount of nutrients delivered to the water column by resuspension indicates that the resuspension loading of particle-bound P to the lake is about the same as the tributary loading, although the resuspended P is likely to be significantly less bioavailable.

The present study examined the influence of rain-induced turbulence on oil droplet size and dispersion of oil spills in Douglas Channel in British Columbia, Canada using hourly atmospheric data in 2011-2013. We examined three types of oils: a light oil (Cold Lake Diluent - CLD), and two heavy oils (Cold Lake Blend - CLB and Access Western Blend - AWB). We found that the turbulent energy dissipation rate produced by rainfalls is comparable to what is produced by wind-induced wave breaking in our study area. With the use of chemical dispersants, our results indicate that a heavy rainfall (rain rate >20 mm h(-1)) can produce the maximum droplet size of 300 pm for light oil and 1000 pm for heavy oils, and it can disperse the light oil with fraction of 22-45% and the heavy oils of 8-13%, respectively. Heavy rainfalls could be a factor for the fate of oil spills in Douglas Channel, especially for a spill of light oil and the use of chemical dispersants.

The water samples were analyzed for Total Nitrogen (TN), Ammonia, Nitrate, Total Phosphorus (TP) and Dissolved Phosphorus (DP). Hourly discharge data were also available at the same section. Concentration and instantaneous loads varied during floods demonstrating a general rising and recessing pollutograph and peak loads usually arrived before peak discharge. Six methods were applied to calculate event total load showing unobvious variation. Totally 192.8t-TN and 5.0t-TP in Event06 and 73.5t-TN and 3.7t-TP in Event08 were exported to the section and maybe until the Chao Lake. About 85.3% (for Event06) and 93.1% (for Event08) of TN total load were ammonia and nitrate loads, which were similar. Particulate phosphorus dominated TP event total loads, among which 38.8% and 43.5% respectively for the two events were DP loads.					; SALLES, Christian/ACA-0920-2022; TOURNOUD, Marie-George/I-9281-2012	Salles, Christian/0009-0007-6553-4213; 															978-0-203-74448-2; 978-1-138-00043-8				2013							313	318																WOS:000328204700048

This paper examines sediment transport and deposition in a glacial meltwater river in 1979, 1993 and 2002, and the downstream variation in thickness of sediment deposits in Lake Nigardsvatn. The thickest deposit was observed next to the delta front and a more rapid downstream decrease occurred during the 1979 event. Particle-size analysis indicated that the 1979 and 2002 sediment layers contained more coarse fractions (>31 mu m) than the 1993 layer. During 1979, coarser sediment was deposited closest to the delta compared to the 1993 and 2002 events. The occurrence of rainfall induced floods during the summer of 2011 led to the highest water discharge and suspended sediment load on record. The observed conditions were comparable to that of higher magnitude floods.																			0144-7815		978-1-907161-33-9				2012	356						202	209																WOS:000310722000025
J	Kutterolf, S; Freundt, A; Burkert, C				Kutterolf, Steffen; Freundt, Armin; Burkert, Cosima			Eruptive history and magmatic evolution of the 1.9 kyr Plinian dacitic Chiltepe Tephra from Apoyeque volcano in west-central Nicaragua	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												The youngest dacitic Plinian eruption in west-central Nicaragua, forming the 18 km(3) Chiltepe Tephra (CT), occurred about nineteen hundred years ago at Apoyeque stratovolcano, which dominates the Chiltepe volcanic complex 15 km north of the capital Managua, where the CT is 2 m thick. We have traced the CT from its proximal facies at the crater rim, through the medial facies in the lowlands around Apoyeque, and to the distal facies up to 550 km offshore in the Pacific. While medial and distal facies consist of widespread Plinian fall deposits, the proximal facies reveals the complexity of this eruption, which we divide into four phases (I-IV). Interaction of rising magma with a pre-existing crater lake generated the phreatomagmatic opening phase I of the eruption, which produced ash fall with accretionary lapilli. Phase II marked a rapid change to persistent magmatic activity that yielded several large Plinian eruptions, declining through a period of unstable eruption conditions, followed by a short hiatus. Phase III began with unstable conditions, probably as a result of eastward migration and widening of the vent, leading to a second period of Plinian eruptions with three major events reaching magma discharge rates five times larger than those of phase II. Phase III again declined through unstable eruption conditions before magmatic activity terminated. Numerous explosions in the shallow hydrothermal system during the final phase IV resulted in the formation of a phreatic tuff ring on the rim of Apoyeque crater. The white, highly-vesicular, dacitic CT pumice contains plagioclase (An(45-68)), orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, and minor hornblende, apatite and titanomagnetite phenocrysts. A very subordinate fraction of gray pumice has the highest crystal content, the least evolved bulk-rock, but the most evolved matrix-glass composition. The CT dacite has two unusual compositional features: (1) all white dacite has the same melt (matrix-glass) composition such that variations in bulk-rock compositions (64-68 wt% SiO2) simply reflect different phenocryst contents of 10-35%, interpreted as the result of gradual phenocryst settling in the magma chamber. (2) Abundant olivine crystals with a bimodal distribution in Mg# (modes at Mg# = 0.75 and Mg# = 0.8) are dispersed throughout the erupted dacite. These are clearly out of equilibrium with the dacitic melt and are interpreted as xenocrysts derived from the basaltic Nejapa-Miraflores volcanic lineament that intersects the Chiltepe volcanic complex and was contemporaneously active. Thermobarometric estimates place the dacitic CT magma reservoir in the upper crust (< 250 MPa), with a temperature of about 890A degrees C and about 5 wt% water dissolved in the melt. Comparing water and chlorine contents with respective solubility models suggests that volatile degassing began in the magma reservoir and triggered the CT eruption. From the vertical compositional variation pattern of the CT we deduce that the conduit tapped the magma chamber not at the top but from the side, at some deeper level, and that subsequent magma withdrawal was governed by both variations in discharge rate and possible upward migration and/or widening of the conduit entrance.

In recognition of the significance of groundwater as a potential pollution pathway and the challenges of localising and assessing inputs that are diffuse and highly variable, robust and effective GIS and remote sensing methodologies to facilitate national and water-body-scale assessments of the potential for groundwater discharge are presented. Firstly, lake water bodies were classified according to 'likelihood' to receive groundwater discharge, defined within a GIS relative to a number of simple criteria including underlying aquifer type and presence of geologic faults, springs and other karst features. The approach facilitated a time- and cost-effective screening of over 800 lakes, which was completed to prioritise subsequent analyses of potential groundwater lake interactions using remotely sensed imagery. Surface water temperature and temperature anomaly maps generated using satellite imagery revealed thermal signals potentially indicative of groundwater lake interactions. Furtheiniore, the results showed that larger (more negative) thermal anomaly values were associated with the higher likelihood classes. This research helps to set the foundation from which key knowledge gaps on the interaction between groundwater and lakes in Ireland can begin to be addressed.

This was part of a multi-year drought which resulted in dwindling water supplies and amplified water restrictions. As a result, the City of Abilene, located approximately 150 miles west of Fort Worth, saw their primary surface water source drop to one of the lowest ever recorded levels. This trigged the need to develop additional water supply, so in 2013 the city embarked on a fast-paced project to increase water storage in Lake Fort Phantom Hill. The project included facility improvements and an outfall pipeline at the Hamby Water Reclamation Facility (WRF). These improvements allowed water to be treated and discharged directly into the lake. This paper describes the design and construction of the five mile pipeline and outfall structure. The authors discuss key design items including pipe sizing, deep burial versus shallow burial, and hydraulic analysis. The pipeline design and construction were successfully completed within one year.																					978-0-7844-7995-7				2016							708	717																WOS:000389583900065

The Priestley-Taytor and deBruin-Keijman methods compared best with the energy-budget values; mean differences were less than 0.1 nm d(-1), and standard deviations were less than 0.3 mm d-1. Both methods require measurement of air temperature, net radiation, and heat storage in the wetland water. The Penman, Jensen-Haise, and Brutsaert-Stricker methods provided the next-best values for evapotranspiration relative to the energy-budget method. The mass-transfer, deBruin, and Stephens-Stewart methods provided the worst comparisons; the mass-transfer and deBruin comparisons with energy-budget values indicated a large standard deviation, and the deBruin and Stephens-Stewart comparisons indicated a large bias. The Jensen-Haise method proved to be cost effective, providing relatively accurate comparisons with the energy-budget method (mean difference = 0.44 mm d(-1), standard deviation = 0.42 mm d(-1)) and requiring only measurements of air temperature and solar radiation. The Mather (Thornthwaite) method is the simplest, requiring only measurement of air temperature, and it provided values that compared relatively well with energy-budget values (mean difference = 0.47 mm d(-1), standard deviation = 0.56 mm d(-1)). Modifications were made to several of the methods to make them more suitable for use in prairie wetlands. The modified Makkink, Jensen-Haise, and Stephens-Stewart methods all provided results that were nearly as close to energy-budget values as were the Priestley-Taylor and deBruin-Keijman methods, and all three of these modified methods only require measurements of air temperature and solar radiation. The modified Hamon method provided values that were within 20 percent of energy-budget values during 95 percent of the comparison periods, and it only requires measurement of air temperature. The mass-transfer coefficient, associated with the commonly used mass-transfer method, varied seasonally, with the largest values occurring during summer.

J	Michaelson, GJ; Ping, CL				Michaelson, GJ; Ping, CL			Soil organic carbon and CO2 respiration at subzero temperature in soils of Arctic Alaska - art. no. 8164	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												[1] Carbon dioxide respiration rates were measured in the laboratory at -2degreesC for 88 arctic Alaska soil horizon samples. Soil horizon samples represented most ATLAS C-flux study sites to a 1-m depth. Sites represented extend across the Alaska Arctic, from tundra at Prudhoe Bay (70degreesN, 149degreesW) in the northeast to the tundra-forest transition zone of the Seward Peninsula (64degreesN, 163degreesW) in the southwest, a range of nearly 1000 km. Results of an initial temperature sensitivity study indicated that at 4degreesC, organic horizons (>20% organic carbon [OC]) have average respiration rates that are twice as high as those found for the mineral horizons. However, as temperature dropped to -2degreesC, respiration in organic horizons was about the same as that for the low OC mineral horizons (with <5% OC). However, organic enriched mineral horizons (with OC 5-20%) maintained higher rates of respiration at the subzero temperature, and rates averaged 1.7 times higher than for the organics at -2 degrees C. Results of -2 degrees C incubations for all study samples indicated that, indeed, there is a good correlation between soil water-soluble OC (wsOC) stocks and CO2 respiration rates in both organic surface horizons and among the high respiring organic enriched mineral horizons, R-2 = 0.70 (p < 0.01) and R-2 = 0.62 (p < 0.01), respectively. The presence of permafrost was associated with increased wsOC substrate levels, and the highest respiration rate found over all samples was in an organic enriched (17.8% OC) mineral horizon from the permafrost layer. High levels of substrates and high respiration rates were associated with surface organic horizons from sites at the forest-tundra transition (Council) for all sites with shrub vegetation and for Eriophorum tussocks at Toolik Lake. Stocks of wsOC were not correlated to soil total OC levels. These results point to the importance of a soil carbon-substrate shift with subzero temperature and its implications for cold-season processes throughout the soil active layer.																			2169-897X	2169-8996				JAN 15	2003	108	D2							8164	10.1029/2001JD000920	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2001JD000920													WOS:000181793500001

Multi-label class assignment in land-use modelling	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE												During the last two decades, a variety of models have been applied to understand and predict changes in land use. These models assign a single-attribute label to each spatial unit at any particular time of the simulation. This is not realistic because mixed use of land is quite common. A more detailed classification allowing the modelling of mixed land use would be desirable for better understanding and interpreting the evolution of the use of land. A possible solution is the multi-label (ML) concept where each spatial unit can belong to multiple classes simultaneously. For example, a cluster of summer houses at a lake in a forested area should be classified as water, forest and residential (built-up). The ML concept was introduced recently, and it belongs to the machine learning field. In this article, the ML concept is introduced and applied in land-use modelling. As a novelty, we present a land-use change model that allows ML class assignment using the k nearest neighbour (kNN) method that derives a functional relationship between land use and a set of explanatory variables. A case study with a rich data-set from Luxembourg using biophysical data from aerial photography is described. The model achieves promising results based on the well-known ML evaluation criteria. The application described in this article highlights the value of the multi-label k nearest neighbour method (MLkNN) for land-use modelling.

J	Tindall, BJ				Tindall, BJ			Prokaryotic diversity in the Antarctic: The tip of the iceberg	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												In contrast to the rather limited diversity of plants and animals to be found in the Antarctic, the microbial diversity of this continent has been shown to be "surprisingly" diverse. Apparently barren soil and rock landscapes, as well as the numerous and diverse lakes found at the edges of the continent, harbor a range of prokaryotes which indicate that the extremely low temperatures which prevail seasonally are no obstacle to microbial colonization. Both direct cultivation methods and modern molecular genetic methods have contributed to our understanding of the range of organisms to be found. Cultivation based studies are often hampered by constraints inherent in the methods selected for the isolation of organisms. Molecular-based approaches do not suffer from the same cultivation-based biases, but other problems need to be taken into consideration. It has rarely been possible to combine both techniques in a single study, nor has it usually been possible to take the results and conclusions drawn from the study of one environment and apply this knowledge to a further series of experiments on the same environment. The Antarctic may be considered to be a geographically well isolated area to study. Comparison with other environments that may also be "isolated" from their surroundings (i.e., hot springs or highly saline lakes) allows parallels to be drawn. The conclusions drawn provide important insights into the way the Antarctic may have been colonized and the microbiota diversified. Much work still needs to be done beyond the simple task of making an inventory. The functioning of complex communities, such as mat systems, requires an understanding of the ecology of the systems, not only at the level of the whole system, but also the role of localized environments within that system. Perhaps these ecosystems have, in the absence of plant and animal communities, a role to play in the monitoring of polar climate change. The information available at present clearly indicates that the Antarctic is deserving of further study at the microbial level.																			0095-3628	1432-184X				APR	2004	47	3					271	283		10.1007/s00248-003-1050-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-003-1050-7								15054676					WOS:000222357300010

The extensive well-aerated sublittoral with sandy bottom sediments has a mesotrophic appearance and supports a diverse fauna with several oxyphilous species, including a very abundant population of Dreissena polymorpha. The phytophilous fauna is limited to small sheltered areas only. The average abundance of the ''small'' animals of macrozoobenthos (without big molluscs) was 2,617 ind. m(-2), their biomass 12.34 g m(-2) (corresponding to 52.2 kJ m(-2)) in 1964-1994. The same figures for big molluscs (mostly Dreissena) were 304 ind, m(-2) and 238 g m(-2) in 1964-1994, and even 864 ind. m(-2) and 687 g m(-2) in 1985-1988, at the time of their special mapping. The sublittoral zone revealed the lowest biomass of ''small'' animals but the highest biomass of big molluscs. The southern, shallower lake regions, more enriched with nutrients and better protected from wind, revealed a significantly higher biomass of ''small'' macrozoobenthos in the near-shore zone than the cleaner and open northern part, while no positive effect of enrichment was observed neither in the biomass of profundal zoobenthos nor in that of big molluscs. The production of the ''small'' macrozoobenthos was calculated as 111 and 53 kJ m(-2) during two annual cycles in Lake Peipsi s. s., the most productive period being the autumn overturn. Lake Peipsi-Pihkva has the highest abundance and biomass of macrozoobenthos among the large lakes of North Europe.

This period witnessed the growth of diverse fisher-forager communities, whose members adapted their settlement patterns and created new technologies in order to take advantage of aquatic resources. Around Lake Turkana in northern Kenya, numerous surface sites have been documented along former shorelines dating to the AHP. Relatively few have been excavated and dated however, and just three - all from the eastern basin - have published faunal analyses. Here, we present archaeofaunal assemblages from the Kalokol region of the western basin, where three sites with microlithic technology, bone harpoons, and radiocarbon dates falling within the AHP were excavated. We present a detailed taphonomic assessment of the fish assemblages and a comparison with both natural and anthropogenic, and ancient and modern, fish bone accumulations. Taxa identified at the Kalokol sites are discussed in terms of the occupants' possible fishing technologies and strategies, drawing on ethological and ethnographic data. Our analysis, combining our data with those published from the eastern basin, enables a broader discussion of how people may have responded to fluctuating AHP environments in the Turkana Basin.

The Sorokaoziorki (Forty Lakelets) complex of wetlands, located in the arid Koibalskaya steppe (Republic of Khakassia, Russian Federation), falls into this category. We documented the origin of the complex's wetlands, patterns of land use and economic activities, and use of the area by multiple bird, mammal, and fish species. The lakelets of the Sorokaoziorki originated from a dried river bed that refilled relatively recently with water introduced from irrigation activities. The resultant wetlands and surrounding wet grasslands within the Sorokaoziorki complex represent a refuge for wildlife, while the surrounding steppe has been turned to pasture. Located at a crossroads of bird flyways, at least 140 bird species use the Sorokaoziorki complex to nest or as a stop-over point during migration. Additionally, we documented the occurrence of seven fish, one lamprey, and seven mammal (including three bat) species within the complex. The planting of sea-buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) and the restriction of grazing around the edges of the wetlands in the Sorokaoziorki wetland complex has contributed to the conservation of this ecologically important area.

Hidden diversity in the freshwater planktonic diatom Asterionella formosa	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Many freshwater and marine algal species are described as having cosmopolitan distributions. Whether these widely distributed morphologically similar algae also share a similar gene pool remains often unclear. In the context of island biogeography theory, stronger spatial isolation deemed typical of freshwater lakes should restrict gene flow and lead to higher genetic differentiation among lakes. Using nine microsatellite loci, we investigate the genetic diversity of a widely distributed freshwater planktonic diatom, Asterionella formosa, across different lakes in Switzerland and the Netherlands. We applied a hierarchical spatial sampling design to determine the geographical scale at which populations are structured. A subset of the isolates was additionally analysed using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. Our results revealed complex and unexpected population structure in A.formosa with evidence for both restricted and moderate to high gene flow at the same time. Different genetic markers (microsatellites and AFLPs) analysed with a variety of multivariate methods consistently revealed that genetic differentiation within lakes was much stronger than among lakes, indicating the presence of cryptic species within A.formosa. We conclude that the hidden diversity found in this study is expected to have implications for the further use of A.formosa in biogeographical, conservation and ecological studies. Further research using species-level phylogenetic markers is necessary to place the observed differentiation in an evolutionary context of speciation.

Climate changes forecasted to occur are reflected in models by slow gradual changes over extended periods of time. Output from weather generators, on the other hand, can simulate short-term extreme conditions and weather patterns. In order to evaluate the likely impact of climate changes on a large sub-tropical lake, specifically the thermal regime of the lake, we constructed climate scenarios using a weather generator. The 30-year scenarios included no change in climate conditions, a gradual change, increased frequency of heat waves and a merging of the latter two. The projected impact on the lake's physical properties was evaluated using an ensemble of 1-D hydrodynamic lake models. The gradual increase scenario had the largest impact on annual temperatures and stratification period; however, increased heat waves had a large effect on the summer lake conditions and introduced a larger degree of variability in water temperature. The use of the ensemble of models resulted in variability in the projected impacts; yet, the large degree of similarity between projected trends and patterns increased confidence in the results. The projected effect the heat waves will have on the lake conditions highlights the need to include heat waves in climate studies and the need for impact studies in order to better understand possible consequences for lake ecosystems.

Brook charr provide an example of within-population variability in behavioural thermoregulation as revealed by a recent study on a lacustrine population of this species. The objectives of the present study were (i) to determine the influence of natural variability in the lake's thermal profiles on the expression of thermoregulatory tactics, and (ii) to determine the vertical and horizontal movements of individuals at different periods of the day to better understand the spatio-temporal behaviour associated with each thermoregulatory tactic. During summer 2010, 30 adult brook charr were equipped with thermo-sensitive radio transmitters to monitor their selected temperatures and daily movements. These individuals exhibited the same four behavioural thermoregulatory tactics observed in 2003 and 2005, but the expression of two of these was weaker in 2010. This result was associated with lake warming, which constrained the expression of two thermoregulatory tactics: brook charr significantly decreased their selected temperatures and daily movements when the mean daily epilimnion temperature was above 22.4 degrees C. This study shows for the first time that the expression of behavioural thermoregulatory tactics is related to the lake's thermal regime and that the tactics are plastic through time.					; Magnan, Pierre/U-9342-2019	Bertolo, Andrea/0000-0002-6018-816X; Magnan, Pierre/0000-0003-3122-7163													1932-6203					MAR 24	2014	9	3							e92514	10.1371/journal.pone.0092514	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0092514								24663489					WOS:000333459900069

Recent studies show that cryoconites are colonized by a diverse range of microorganisms, including viruses, bacteria and algae. Whether microbial communities on the surface of glaciers are actively influencing biogeochemical cycles or are just present in a dormant state has been a matter of debate for long time. Here, we report primary production and community respiration of cryoconite holes upon glaciers in Svalbard, Greenland and the European Alps. Microbial activity in cryoconite holes is high despite maximum temperatures seldom exceeding 0.1 degrees C. In situ primary production and respiration in cryoconites during the summer is often comparable with that found in soils in warmer and nutrient richer regions. Considering only glacier areas outside Antarctica and a conservative average cryoconite distribution on glacial surfaces, we found that on a global basis cryoconite holes have the potential to fix as much as 64 Gg of carbon per year (i.e. 98 Gg of photosynthesis minus 34 Gg of community respiration). Most lakes and rivers are generally considered as heterotrophic systems, but our results suggest that glaciers, which contain 75% of the freshwater of the planet, are largely autotrophic systems.

J	Vainu, M; Terasmaa, J				Vainu, Marko; Terasmaa, Jaanus			Changes in climate, catchment vegetation and hydrogeology as the causes of dramatic lake-level fluctuations in the Kurtna Lake District, NE Estonia	ESTONIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Numerous lakes in the world serve as sensitive indicators of climate change. Water levels for lakes Ahnejarv and Martiska, two vulnerable oligotrophic closed-basin lakes on sandy plains in northeastern Estonia, fell more than 3 m in 1946 1987 and rose up to 2 m by 2009. Earlier studies indicated that changes in rates of groundwater abstraction were primarily responsible for the changes, but scientifically sound explanations for water-level fluctuations were still lacking. Despite the inconsistent water-level dataset, we were able to assess the importance of changing climate, catchment vegetation and hydrogeology in water-level fluctuations in these lakes. Our results from water-balance simulations indicate that before the initiation of groundwater abstraction in 1972 a change in the vegetation composition on the catchments triggered the lake-level decrease. The water-level rise in 1990-2009 was caused, in addition to the reduction of groundwater abstraction rates, by increased precipitation and decreased evaporation. The results stress that climate, catchment vegetation and hydrogeology must all be considered while evaluating the causes of modern water-level changes in lakes.					; Terasmaa, Jaanus/E-7077-2018	Terasmaa, Jaanus/0000-0002-1346-6411; 													1736-4728	1736-7557				MAR	2014	63	1					45	61		10.3176/earth.2014.04	http://dx.doi.org/10.3176/earth.2014.04													WOS:000332304400004

Feeding Ecology of Pelagic Larval Burbot in Northern Lake Huron, Michigan	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Burbot Lota lota are a key demersal piscivore across the Laurentian Great Lakes whose populations have declined by about 90% in recent decades. Larval Burbot typically hatch in the early spring and rely on abundant crustacean zooplankton prey. We examined the stomach contents of larval Burbot from inshore (15m) and offshore sites (37 and 91m) in northern Lake Huron, Michigan. Concurrent zooplankton vertical tows at the same sites showed that the prey community was dominated by calanoid copepods, dreissenid mussel veligers, and rotifers. Burbot consumed mostly cyclopoid copepods, followed by copepod nauplii and calanoid copepods. Chesson's index of selectivity was calculated and compared among sites and months for individual Burbot. According to this index, larval Burbot exhibited positive selection for cyclopoid copepods and copepod nauplii and negative selection for calanoid copepods, cladocerans, rotifers, and dreissenid veligers. This selectivity was consistent across sites and throughout the sampling period. Burbot displayed little variation in their prey preferences during the larval stage, which suggests that the recent shifts in zooplankton abundance due to the invasion of the predatory zooplankter Bythotrephes longimanus and competition from invasive Rainbow Smelt Osmerus mordax could negatively impact larval Burbot populations.					; George, Elizabeth/AAR-7371-2021	Roseman, Edward/0000-0002-5315-9838; Karboski, Ellen/0009-0005-9352-2733; 													0002-8487	1548-8659				NOV 1	2013	142	6					1716	1723		10.1080/00028487.2013.788561	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2013.788561													WOS:000327469700022

Limnological parameters recorded from two spots collected in three phases, such as temperature, pH, transparency, conductivity, DO, BOD, total dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended solids (TSS), total alkalinity, total hardness and chloride, were evaluated. From this observation, it is reported that there are marked variations in different water quality parameters of two urban ponds during the study period. The value of water temperature in Pond A and B was 22.0 and 21.3 degrees C, respectively. pH value (7.9) was highest in Pond B. Pond B water was more turbid than Pond A. The highest values of other parameters like conductivity (218.50 mu S/cm) DO (8.47 mg/l), BOD (5.69 mg/l), TDS (135.19 mg/l), TSS (67.60 mg/l), total alkalinity (181.15 mg/l), total hardness (145.66 mg/l) and chloride (58.94 mg/l) were found in case of Pond B. Maximum macrophytic vegetations were found in Pond B in comparison with Pond A. The study of the zooplankton community reveals that the maximum occurrence of rotifers in Pond B indicates pollution status.

J	NOLEN, SL; WILHM, J; HOWICK, G				NOLEN, SL; WILHM, J; HOWICK, G			FACTORS INFLUENCING INORGANIC TURBIDITY IN A GREAT PLAINS RESERVOIR	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Nephelometric turbidity and Secchi disc were measured at 16 sampling stations at Lake Carl Blackwell [LCB], Oklahoma [USA] on 54 dates from Feb. 12, 1982 to Jan. 24, 1983. Measurements of precipitation, wind velocity, effective fetch, water depth, and sediment particle size were also recorded. Turbidity values ranged from 16 to 1140 nephelometric turbidity units [NTU] and Secchi disc transparency from 2 to 110 cm. Turbidity was generally highest at shallow water sampling stations in the western end and upper arms of LCB and decreased with increasing depth. Increases in turbidity during the spring of 1982 were attributed to sediment resuspension and drastic turbidity increases were observed following heavy May rains. Two multiple regression models were developed to predict nephelometric turbidity levels for a given set of climatological and morphometric parameters. One model was based on data for the entire sampling period and is useful in predicting tubidity under high inflow conditions. A 2nd model was derived from data collected prior to periods of heavy rains and is useful in predicting turbidity under more common conditions of moderate winds and rain.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1985	123	2					109	117		10.1007/BF00018973	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00018973													WOS:A1985AHD8100002
J	Wang, XJ; Liu, RM				Wang, XJ; Liu, RM			Spatial analysis and eutrophication assessment for chlorophyll a in Taihu Lake	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Spatial structure analysis and kriging analysis have been identified to be useful tools in illustrating the spatial patterns of variables. Taihu Lake is one of the largest fresh water lakes in China, and has suffered serious eutrophication in recent years due to the rapid economic development and growing environmental pollution in the Taihu Catchment. In this paper, spatial structural analysis, kriging interpolation and eutrophication assessment were carried out for chlorophyll a in the lake. Studies show that spherical model could be applied to fit all experimental variograms. Positive nuggets were observed for three directions except NE-SW direction. The variograms show some anisotropy with anisotropic ratio falling within 1.76. The spatial structural patterns of chlorophyll a in the lake were affected by factors such as distribution of pollution sources, water flow and wind. Two-dimensional ordinary block kriging was applied for interpolation process. An eutrophication assessment map was also made based on a water-quality evaluation standard. Results show that the content of chlorophyll a in Taihu Lake was quite high. The whole lake has suffered serious eutrophication. However, the eutrophic situation varied in space. Higher contents of chlorophyll a appeared mainly in the northern part of the lake.																			0167-6369					FEB	2005	101	1-3					167	174											15736882					WOS:000226975900012
J	Kling, HJ				Kling, HJ			A summary of past and recent plankton of Lake Winnipeg, Canada using algal fossil remains	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY					Special Session on Physical Environment and History of the Lake Winnipeg Basin at the Geological-Association-of-Canada Meeting	MAY 27-29, 1996	WINNIPEG, CANADA	Geol Assoc Canada				Although the phytoplankton and protozoan assemblages of Lake Winnipeg are quite variable both, spatial and temporally, knowledge of their current distribution and ecology enables them to be used as indicators providing unique information concerning past and recent ecosystem conditions. Many of the main taxa have been similar throughout history although there have been dramatic changes in their abundance. Lake Winnipeg is currently very responsive to the climatic conditions in its drainage basin and it appears, historically, to have been a diatom-bluegreen algal lake with Tintinnids and thecate amoeba forming significant components of the protozoan community. A wide variety of microfossil remains have been used to infer past conditions in this large prairie lake. Microfossils reported from the long core 103 (8 m) taken from the north basin of LakeWinnipeg and short core Namao 7a taken from the south basin of the lake in August 1994 indicate that the lake has experienced several changes over its history. Diatom assemblages, low throughout the core 103 below 50 cm, except for a peak around 300-400 cm are virtually absent below 690-800 cm (Lake Agassiz). Stephanodiscus and Aulacoseira are the two major pelagic diatom genera represented throughout the lake's history. Species changes occur near the top of the core indicate increased anthropogenic eutrophication. Shallow water littoral taxa were never abundant at either coring sites. The presence of planktic cyanoprokaryote (cyanophyte, cyanobacteria, bluegreen algae) remains (akinetes) from 600 cm depth and the progressive increase in abundance from 400 cm to through the top 100 cm of the core indicates increasing phosphorus levels, warming summer temperatures and increasing summer nitrogen limitation in the lake. Nitrogen fixing bluegreens (especially Anabaena and Aphanizomenon akinetes) and the diatoms (Aulacoseira ambigua, A. granulata, A. islandica, S. binderanus, and S. niagarae) were abundant in the upper sediments and changes after 100 cm can be interpreted as the effects of human impact. These taxa indicative of increase eutrophication, in addition to S. agassizensis, Melosira varians and Cyclostephanos dubius, are representative of present day plankton. The short core Namao 7a was dated by (Pb)210 and the fossil remains also show a rise in the Aulacoseira (particularly A. granulata and A. ambigua) and bluegreen akinetes in the last 40 years as was seen in the upper sediments of the 103 core. There was an interesting peak in chrysophyte cysts during the 1930's which corresponds nicely with climatic conditions during this period. The fires accompaning the hot dry period in the mid 70's can be seen in the dramatic rise in charcoal during this period. Multiple types of micro fossils remains provides several useful tools for interpreting past lacustrine conditions.																			0921-2728					MAR	1998	19	3					297	307		10.1023/A:1007990217568	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1007990217568													WOS:000073667600007

To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study aiming to detect and analyse the genetic diversity and prevalence of AmFV in Korean honeybee colonies. Phylogenetic analysis based on baculovirus repeat open reading frame-N gene (Bro-N) sequences revealed that AmFV isolates from the Republic of Korea (ROK) fell into two distinct lineages, with genetic origins in Switzerland and China, with nucleotide similarities of 98.3% and 98.2%, respectively. Our prevalence analysis demonstrated a noteworthy infection rate of AmFV in 545 honeybee colonies, reaching 33.09% in 2022 and increasing to 44.90% by 2023. Intriguingly, we also detected AmFV in Varroa destructor mites, highlighting their potential role as vectors and carriers of AmFV. The presence of AmFV was correlated with an increased infection rate of sacbrood virus, deformed wing virus, Lake Sinai virus 2, black queen cell virus, and Nosema ceranae in honeybee colonies. These findings provide valuable insight into the prevalence and potential transmission mechanisms of AmFV in honeybee colonies in the ROK. The results of this study may be instrumental in the effective management of viral infections in honeybee apiaries.

Near-constant retreat rate of a terrestrial margin of the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the last deglaciation	GEOLOGY												The Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) was the largest ice sheet during the last glacial period. An accurate representation of its behavior during the last deglaciation is critical to understanding its influence on and response to a changing climate. We use 10Be dating and Bayesian modeling to track the recession of the southwest sector of the Labrador Dome of the LIS along an similar to 500-km-long transect west of Lake Superior during the last deglaciation. This transect reflects terrestrial ice-margin retreat and crosses multiple moraine sets, with the southwestern part of the transect deglaciated by ca. 19 ka and the northeastern part deglaciated by ca. 10 ka. The predominant behavior of the ice margin during this interval is near-constant retreat with retreat rates varying between similar to 59 m/a and 38 m/a. The moraine sets mark standstills and/or readvances that in total constitute only similar to 17% of the retreat interval. The spatial and temporal pattern of ice-margin retreat tracked here differs from existing reconstructions that are based on using isochrons to define ice-margin positions. Acknowledging the uncertainties associated with the modeled ages of ice-margin retreat, we suggest that the overall retreat pattern is consistent with forcing by a gradual increase in Northern Hemisphere, high-latitude summer insolation. The pattern of ice-margin retreat is inconsistent with Greenland ice-core temperature records, and thus these records may not be suitable to drive models of the LIS.

Control of nutrient loads is perceived as the primary restoration method. Quantifying temporal variation of nutrient loads is essential to understand the dynamic relationships of nutrient source-impacts in the urban water system and investigate the operational efficiency of treatment facilities for eutrophication control. Here, a holistic approach was developed to estimate nutrient loads from different sources and evaluate nutrient impacts on the urban water environment. An integrated catchment model of nutrient loads was built and applied to calculate river nutrient loads from untreated rainfall runoff, untreated sewage, and treated recharge into the eutrophic Dianchi Lake from an urban river catchment with limited infrastructure. Nutrient impacts on the lake were evaluated and a load reduction strategy was given a hint to reduce nutrient impacts of urban rivers. During the study period 2014-2016, nutrient loads from the urban river generally decreased except during heavy winter rainfall events and high-intensity pollution events associated with rainfall runoff. The average contribution of annual nutrient loads to the lake capacity indicated the underestimation of nutrient impacts of urban rivers. This approach provides new insights into urban water management and underscores the importance of sewage infrastructure.

This study aimed to identify the updated topographic and bathymetric data required for the efficient management and usage of Altinapa reservoir, changes in surface area and volume of the facility, and to form a Reservoir Information System (RIS). Two digital elevation models, from 2009 and 1984, were used to determine changes in the storage capacity of the reservoir. The calculations indicated that, within this 25-year period, the storage capacity of the reservoir decreased by 12.7% due to sedimentation. A Dam Information System (RIS) was developed from a wide range of data sources, including topographic and bathymetric data of the reservoir and its surrounding area, data on specific features such as plant cover, water quality characteristics (Temperature, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Secchi Disk Depth (SDD) and pH), geological structure, average water level, water supplied from springs, evaporation value of the reservoir, and precipitation.

The data obtained elucidate development of regional and local Holocene vegetation in response to climatic changes. As far as 10600-10000 years ago, the Kotokel' Lake depression was covered by the forest tundra and cryophilic forest-steppe vegetation. The summer temperature rise and some increase in aridity 10000-9000 years ago widened steppe areas, which were replaced by forests 9000 years ago. The interval of 8500-8000 years ago was characterized by the distribution maximum of spruce forests in Buryatia. Birch and spruce were widespread in forest communities till 6000 year ago. The dispersal of spruce suggests a more humid and less continental climate of the mid-Holocene time. Climatic conditions optimal for fir growth on the ridge slopes facing the Lake Baikal existed 3000-6000 years ago. The pine and larch forests, which became dominant in the vegetation cover during the last 3000 years, characterize the period of less humid and more continental climate in the region.					; Tarasov, Pavel/ABG-3993-2020	/0000-0002-7219-5009; Nadezhda, Dorofeyuk/0000-0001-6953-8384													0869-5938	1555-6263				JAN-FEB	2002	10	1					88	96																WOS:000174076500006

Modeling annual growth variation using a hierarchical Bayesian approach and the von Bertalanffy growth function, with application to lake trout in southern Lake Huron	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We compared two models for time-varying growth using a hierarchical Bayesian approach to inference. Both models were derived from the same time-invariant von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF), and our model comparisons were based on the deviance information criterion. We fit models to length and age data for 15,675 individual lake trout Salvelinus namaycush collected during annual spring gill-net surveys in southern Lake Huron from 1976 to 2004. We found that a model structured with both year and cohort effects outperformed a model that only used the same year-specific VBGF parameters for all age-groups. For the better model, the full version that allowed all VBGF parameters to vary over time also outperformed alternatives for which some parameters were constant. Length at age changed greatly over the 1976-2004 period, and in some years different ages changed in different directions. These complex patterns, which were due to the combination of cohort-specific growth and year-specific changes in growth environment, were well captured by our model. When we modeled growth as varying over time, inferences about VBGF parameters differed between the two models, and correlations among VBGF parameters also differed from the usually reported relations based on time-invariant models.

Holocene fire-regime changes near the treeline in the Retezat Mts. (Southern Carpathians, Romania)	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												To investigate Holocene vegetation and fire-disturbance histories in the treeline ecotone, macroscopic charcoal, plant-macrofossil, and pollen records from two lacustrine sediment records were used. Lake Lia is on the southern slope and Lake Brazi is on the northern slope of the west-east-oriented Retezat Mountain range in the Romanian Carpathians. The records were used to reconstruct Holocene fire-return intervals (FRIs) and biomass burning changes. Biomass burning was highest at both study sites during the drier and warmer early Holocene, suggesting that climate largely controlled fire occurrence. Fuel load also influenced the fire regime as shown by the rapid biomass-burning changes in relation to timberline shifts. Overall, the number of inferred fire episodes was smaller on the northern than on the southern slope. FRIs were also comparatively longer (1000-4000 years) on the northern slope where Picea abies-dominated woodlands persisted around Lake Brazi throughout the Holocene. On the southern slope, where Pinus mugo was more abundant around Lake Lia, FRIs were significantly shorter (80-1650 years). A period of frequent fire episodes occurred around 1900-1300 cal yr BP on the southern slope, when chironomid-inferred summer temperatures increased and the pollen record documents increased anthropogenic activity near the treeline. However, the forest clearance by burning to increase grazing land was subdued in comparison to other European regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Distinct diversity patterns of Planctomycetes associated with the freshwater macrophyte Nuphar lutea (L.) Smith	ANTONIE VAN LEEUWENHOEK INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL AND MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY					3rd Meeting of the Planctomycetes-Verrucomicrobia-Chlamydiae Superphylum Community	MAY 10-12, 2017	Porto, PORTUGAL					Members of the phylum Planctomycetes were originally described as freshwater bacteria. Most recent studies, however, address planctomycete diversity in other environments colonized by these microorganisms, including marine and terrestrial ecosystems. This study was initiated in order to revisit the specific patterns of planctomycete diversity in freshwater habitats using cultivation-independent approaches. The specific focus was made on planctomycetes associated with Nuphar lutea (L.) Smith, an emergent macrophyte with floating leaves, which is widespread in the Holarctic. As revealed by Illumina pair-end sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments, the bacterial assemblages colonizing floating leaf blades of waterlilies sampled from two different boreal lakes displayed similar composition but were distinct from the planktonic bacterial communities. 16S rRNA gene fragments from the Planctomycetes comprised 0.1-1 and 1-2.2% of total 16S rRNA gene reads retrieved from water samples and plant leaves, respectively. Planktonic planctomycetes were mostly affiliated with the class Planctomycetaceae (77-97%), while members of the Phycisphaerae were less abundant (3-22%). The relative proportion of the latter group, however, increased by 13-45% on leaves of N. lutea. The Phycisphaera-related group WD2101, Pirellula-like planctomycetes, as well as Gemmata, Zavarzinella and Planctopirus species were the most abundant groups of planctomycetes associated with plant leaves, which may suggest their involvement in the degradation of plant-derived organic matter.

J	Dayyani, S; Daly, G; Vandenberg, J				Dayyani, Shadi; Daly, Gillian; Vandenberg, Jerry			Approach to Assessing the Effects of Aerial Deposition on Water Quality in the Alberta Oil Sands Region	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Snow cover forms a porous medium that acts as a receptor for aerially deposited polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and metals. The snowpack, acting as a temporary storage reservoir, releases contaminants accumulating over the winter during a relatively short melt period. This process could result in elevated concentrations of contaminants in melt water. Recent studies in the Alberta oil sands region have documented increases in snowpack and lake sediment concentrations; however, no studies have addressed the fate and transport of contaminants during the snowmelt period. This study describes modelling approaches that were developed to assess potential effects of aerially deposited PAHs and metals to snowpack and snowmelt water concentrations. The contribution of snowmelt to freshwater PAH concentrations is assessed using a dynamic, multi-compartmental fate model, and the contribution to metal concentrations is estimated using a mass-balance approach. The modelling approaches described herein were applied to two watersheds in the Alberta oil sands region for two planned oil sands developments. Accumulation of PAHs in a lake within the deposition zone was also modelled for comparison to observed concentrations.																			1061-4303	1554-7531				FEB 1	2016	88	2					175	189		10.2175/106143016X14504669767256	http://dx.doi.org/10.2175/106143016X14504669767256								26803105					WOS:000371528000009

Common trends were revealed in the correlated datasets: a positive spike (a warming) in the Allerod and much lower values in the Younger Dryas; their increase towards the Preboreal; very high delta(18)O at the end of the Preboreal; very low values at the end of the Boreal (similar to 8200-8400 BP); consistent increase towards the Atlantic; and peaks at similar to 8000 and 6900 BP. Episodes of rapid delta(13)C increase at the beginning of the Preboreal (near 10,000 BP) and in the middle of the Boreal, are regarded as the effects of the synchronous fall of the lake levels (climate aridification) in the region.

Aquatic heatwaves increase surface chlorophyll concentrations in experimental and reference lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS												Aquatic heatwaves are increasing in frequency, intensity, and duration worldwide. While increases in mean water temperatures are linked to enhanced phytoplankton biomass, it is unclear how heatwaves alter phytoplankton dynamics in lakes at an ecosystem scale. We investigated changes in surface chlorophyll during 29 summer heatwaves between 2008 and 2019 in 3 north temperate lakes. These lakes vary in staining and were either references or manipulated with nutrients and top predator additions. The manipulations provided a variety of nutrient, grazing, and light conditions during heatwave and non-heatwave conditions. Surface chlorophyll concentrations increased during 24 out of 29 heatwaves. In the low-nutrient reference lake the mean increase in chlorophyll was 57% while in the two experimental lakes the mean increases were 127% and 183%. Overall, the effects of the whole-lake experiments were variable but still provided context for possible patterns amid a diverse set of food web and nutrient conditions.

Incorporating weather in counts and trends of migrating Common Nighthawks	AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY												Effective conservation planning for species of concern requires long -term monitoring data that can accurately estimate population trends. Supplemental or alternative methods for estimating population trends are necessary for species that are poorly sampled by traditional breeding bird survey methods. Counts of migrating birds are commonly used to assess raptor population trends and could be useful for additional taxa that migrate diurnally and are difficult to monitor during the breeding season. In North America, the Common Nighthawk (Chordeiles minor) is challenging to detect during comprehensive dawn surveys like the North American Breeding Bird Survey and is considered a species of conservation concern because of steep population declines across its range. We conducted standardized evening counts of migrating Common Nighthawks at a fixed survey location along western Lake Superior each autumn from 2008 to 2022. To document peak migration activity, counts spanned -3 hours each evening from mid-August to early September for a mean of 19.4 +/- 2.4 days. These count data were then used to assess the effects of weather on daily counts and high-count days and to calculate population trends over this 15-year period. We used generalized linear mixed effects models to determine the relationship between daily counts and high-count days (i.e., >= 1000 migrating nighthawks) and weather variables. Additionally, using our 15-year dataset, we calculated a geometric mean passage rate that accounted for annual differences in weather to estimate count trends. Annual counts averaged -18,000 (min = 2514, max = 32,837) individuals and high-count days occurred 56 times throughout the course of the study. Model results indicated lighter, westerly winds and warmer temperatures were associated with higher daily counts and greater probability of a large migratory flight. Results from the trend analyses suggest stable or non-significantly increasing trends for Common Nighthawks during this monitoring period; however, the trend models explained a relatively low percentage of the variation in the counts. Results from a power analysis suggest that continued monitoring efforts and adjustments with weather covariates will be necessary to effectively use visible migration count data to estimate Common Nighthawk trends. Establishing annual monitoring programs that use standardized visual counts to document Common Nighthawk migration at key sites across North America may provide supplemental information useful for population trend estimates of this species. Therefore, we advocate for the use of visible migration counts to monitor Common Nighthawks in North America and emphasize the value of long -term monitoring efforts.																			1712-6568					MAR	2024	19	1							9	10.5751/ACE-02621-190109	http://dx.doi.org/10.5751/ACE-02621-190109								39027484					WOS:001190626300001

One of the promontories of this region, named Bharti, depicting similar set up was selected for the study of chemical parameters with special reference to its ionic characters. Water samples from 6 selected lakes of Bharti promontory, Larsemann Hills area were collected during the austral summer of 2004-05 and analysed for major ionic concentration and Total Dissolved Solid (TDS). This study is aimed at understanding the water chemistry of lakes of this island with emphasis on correlation between different ionic concentrations, TDS and its possible causes. The study will provide baseline data that will be useful for planning further studies. Analytical result shows that the water chemistry of these lakes is mainly governed by the lithology, precipitation, drainage and marine environment. Minor contribution of evaporation, has also been observed on the chemistry of one of the lake water. The main source of water for these lakes comes mainly from snow precipitation and its melting. The drainage line mostly goes towards eastern direction for these lakes.																			0016-7622	0974-6889				SEP	2011	78	3					217	225		10.1007/s12594-011-0085-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12594-011-0085-5													WOS:000295167400003

The results have shown that, very strong precipitation occurred in western China at 30 kaBP, suggesting extremely enhanced summer Indian monsoon. Precipitation was high in southwestern China at 18 kaBP, especially the southern part of southwestern China, due to the southward shift of the westerlies and a low pressure cell occurred over northern India. The precipitation at 6 kaBP shows the complicated patterns for different regions of China, suggesting different climate dynamics. The comparison of the independent lake level/ area-based reconstruction of precipitation and the palaeo-climate simulations is an effective way for the validation of each method to reconstruct the palaeo-precipitation quantitatively, and for understanding the dynamic mechanisms of climatic change.																			1001-6538	1861-9541				DEC	2001	46			S			22	27		10.1007/BF03187231	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03187231													WOS:000174347600006

A total of 34 species of heterotrophic nanoflagellates from 15 taxa and 15 species of ciliates from 4 classes are identified. In different parts of the reservoir, the biomass of the microbial community varies from 26.2 to 64.3% (on average 45.5%) of the total plankton biomass. Heterotrophic bacteria are the main component of the microbial community, averaging 63.9% of the total microbial biomass. They are the second (after the phytoplankton) component of the plankton and contribute on average 28.6% to the plankton biomass. The high ratio of the production of heterotrophic bacteria to the production of phytoplankton indicates the important role of bacteria, which transfer carbon of allochthonous dissolved organic substances to a food web of the reservoir.

A test of philopatry by common musk turtles	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												We tested philopatry by common musk turtles Sternotherus odoratus in a Virginia lake for 9 wk during summer 2003. Using unbaited crab pots, 10 trapping sites were established in the littoral zone around the lake perimeter and pots were sampled daily, yielding 560 turtle captures. Musk turtles trapped at the two sites separated by the greatest distance (1.1 km) were marked and released at the opposite site; turtles captured at the eight sites in-between were marked and released at the capture site. Of 287 captures of turtles released at their capture site, 57 were recaptured and 43 of these were at the original capture site. Of 140 captures of turtles displaced 1.1 Ion, 76 were recaptured and 15 of these were turtles that returned to their site of original capture. Turtles moved significantly more once they had been displaced, and males moved more frequently, but not over longer distances than females. These data indicate that S. odoratus is capable of homing and that site fidelity is exhibited by both male and female turtles.

Sentinel-2A data was retrospectively used to monitor the state of the lake, which is located near the largest land-based oil extraction plant in Europe, with particular attention to chlorophyll a during algal blooms and petroleum hydrocarbons. In winter 2017, a massive dinoflagellate bloom (10.4 x 10(6) cell/L) of Peridinium umbonatum and a simultaneous presence of hydrocarbons were observed at the lake surface. Furthermore, a recent study using metagenomic analyses carried out three months later identified a hydrocarbonoclastic microbial community specialized in the degradation aromatic and nitroaromatic hydrocarbons. In this study, Sentinel-2A imagery was able to detect the presence of chlorophyll a in the waters, while successfully distinguishing the signal from that of hydrocarbons. Remotely sensed results confirmed surface reference measurements of lacustrine phytoplankton, chlorophyll a, and the presence of hydrocarbons during algal blooms, thereby explaining the presence of the hydrocarbonoclastic microbial community found in the lake three months after the oil spill event. The combination of emerging methodologies such as satellite systems and metagenomics represent an important support methodology for describing complex contaminations in diverse ecosystems.					; D'Ugo, Emilio/AAA-6636-2021; messineo, valentina/JCE-7327-2023; MAGURANO, FABIO/B-9975-2016; Magurano, Fabio/B-9975-2016; Giuseppetti, Roberto/AAA-6508-2021	Messineo, valentina/0000-0001-6336-1768; Magurano, Fabio/0000-0002-0394-7043; D'Ugo, Emilio/0000-0001-5852-7575; Giuseppetti, Roberto/0000-0001-9958-164X; Laneve, Giovanni/0000-0001-6108-9764; Mukherjee, Arghya/0000-0002-8996-9971														2072-4292				JAN	2022	14	1							121	10.3390/rs14010121	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14010121													WOS:000751051000001
J	Palijan, G				Palijan, Goran			Short-term response of the phytoplankton size structure to flooding	INLAND WATERS												Phytoplankton in floodplain lakes are frequently characterised as "small" algae but are rarely described with respect to size category (pico-, nano-, or microphytoplankton). Moreover, it is not clear which size category responds first to flood or which category total phytoplankton biomass is most related to. These questions are important in understanding the development of floodplain ecosystems following flooding and were evaluated on the dataset collected from a thermally stratified floodplain lake, Lake Sakadas (Kopacki Rit, Croatia), during spring flood conditions. Relationships of phytoplankton with hydrology and environmental conditions and contribution of each size fraction to total phytoplankton biomass were evaluated using path analysis. At the surface water layer, picophytoplankton developed first, followed by nanophytoplankton and microphytoplankton, suggesting temporal niche separation. Picophytoplankton increased in abundance just before every maxima of chlorophyll concentration, a pattern absent at the bottom water layer where picophytoplankton were a dominant group. The results suggest that analyses of the smallest phytoplankton size category are needed to better understand the controlling mechanisms of whole phytoplankton dynamics in floodplain lakes, with specific emphasis on smallest pico-sized component as "first-responders" to floodplain inundation.

So far, four states have passed legislation permitting the carrying of concealed handguns on university campuses and several other states are considering such legislation. The purpose of this study to assess the perceptions and practices of college faculty regarding support for carrying concealed handguns on their campuses. A valid and reliable questionnaire was sent to a random sample of 1,125 faculty at 15 randomly selected state universities in five Great Lakes states. A two wave postal mailing in the Spring of 2012 was conducted to help ensure an adequate response rate. A total of 791 (70 %) of the faculty responded. The vast majority felt safe on their campuses (98 %) and were not supportive of people carrying concealed handguns on their campuses (94 %). Seven of the eight potential disadvantages of carrying concealed handguns on campus were supported by the majority of faculty members. Those who were significantly more likely to perceive there to be disadvantages to carrying concealed handguns on campus were: those who did not own a firearm (OR = 4.89), Democrats (OR = 4.52) or Independents (OR = 2.25), Asians (OR = 2.49), and females (OR = 1.51). The vast majority of faculty felt safe on their campuses and perceived that carrying concealed handguns on campuses create more risks than benefits to the campus environment. Aggressive efforts are needed to help maintain the uniquely safe environment of college campuses.																			0094-5145	1573-3610				APR	2013	38	2					366	373		10.1007/s10900-012-9626-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10900-012-9626-0								23089903					WOS:000316074600021

Woodruff			Characterizing Total Phosphorus in Current and Geologic Utah Lake Sediments: Implications for Water Quality Management Issues	HYDROLOGY												Utah Lake is highly eutrophic with large phosphorous inflows and a large internal phosphorous reservoir in the sediment. There are debates over whether this phosphorous is from geologic or more recent anthropologic sources. This study characterizes total phosphorous in geologic and current lake sediments to attempt to address that question. The average total phosphorous concentrations in the lake sediment were 666 ppm, with most samples in the 600 to 800 ppm range with a few larger values. Concentrations in historic geologic sediments were not statistically different from lake sediments. A spatial analysis showed that phosphorous distributions appeared continuous from the lake to the shore and that high and low values could be attributed to areas of seeps and springs (low) or feed lots and waste water discharge (high). These results indicate that geologic sediments without anthropogenic impacts are not statistically different than current lake sediments. The high values indicate that internal natural phosphorous loadings could be significant and the impaired state may be relatively insensitive to external anthropogenic loadings. If this is the case, then mitigation efforts to address anthropogenic sources may have minimal impacts. This case study presents an impaired water body where non-anthropogenic nutrient sources are significant and shows that reservoir management decisions should consider these non-anthropogenic phosphorous sources relative to anthropogenic sources. This study can serve as a template for evaluating the importance of geologic phosphorous sources for management decisions.					; Williams, Gustavious/P-7252-2014	Abu-Hmeidan, Hani/0000-0002-6391-0242; Williams, Gustavious/0000-0002-2781-0738														2306-5338				MAR	2018	5	1							8	10.3390/hydrology5010008	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/hydrology5010008													WOS:000455156200007

CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON RUNOFF, SEDIMENT, AND NUTRIENT LOADS IN AN AGRICULTURAL WATERSHED IN THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI RIVER BASIN	APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE												Projected climate change can impact various aspects of agricultural systems, including the nutrient and sediment loads exported from agricultural fields. This study evaluated the potential changes in runoff, sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus loads using projected climate estimates from 2041-2070 in the Beasley Lake watershed in Mississippi, USA, using the Annualized Agricultural Non-Point Source (AnnAGNPS) pollution watershed model. For baseline conditions and model inputs an earlier validated simulation of the watershed was used with an event-based NSE of 0.81 for runoff and 0.54 for sediment without calibration. Fifteen global climate models (GCMs) for the climate change scenario RCP8.5 in Western Mississippi were used. Daily precipitation and air temperature were generated with the weather generator SYNTOR. Daily climate data derived from all 15 GCMS were used in AnnAGNPS simulations to generate ensemble projected loads, and climate data from four GCMs were used in simulations to assess the effectiveness of five different conservation practices for reducing projected loads. Predicted median annual-average pollutant loads increased by 9% to 12% with ensemble projected climate change. However, no-tillage and cover crop conservation practices were predicted to reduce pollutant loads from 20% to 75% below historical levels despite the impacts of climate change. This study suggests that greater implementation of conservation practices can be effective at mitigating water quality degradation associated with projected climate change.					; Momm, Henrique/C-7139-2013	Momm, Henrique/0000-0003-3775-7958; Busteed, Phillip/0000-0002-7895-2955; Locke, Martin/0000-0001-7145-530X; Witthaus, Lindsey/0000-0002-0909-060X													0883-8542	1943-7838					2017	33	3					379	392		10.13031/aea.12047	http://dx.doi.org/10.13031/aea.12047													WOS:000404836800009

Shrinking lakes in Tibet linked to the weakening Asian monsoon in the past 8.2 ka	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Expansion or shrinkage of closed lakes is a natural response to fluctuations in precipitation and evaporation, linked closely to changes in strength or position of atmospheric circulation. In Tibet, there are many such lakes with paleo-shorelines that can be used for reconstructions of climate history. Despite the fact that many paleo-shorelines are well preserved in Tibet, dating them has been seriously hindered by various difficulties. Here we present the first optical dating chronology for a series of paleo-shorelines in Zhari Namco, the third-largest inland lake in central Tibet. Our results indicate that the lake level has dropped 128 m over the past 8.2 ka. Younger shorelines are found at lower altitudes, indicating that the shorelines follow a geomorphic-chronological order and a broadly continuous trend of stepwise shrinkage. The surface area of Zhari Namco has shrunk in size from 4605 km(2) at 8.2 ka ago to 996 km(2) at present: 300 km(3) of water has been lost from this lake. Such a loss in water implies a significant reduction in precipitation over the past 8.2 ka, a likely result of a weakening Asian monsoon. Following the decreasing precipitation since the early Holocene, this area has become increasingly arid. (c) 2013 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Gradients of induction of CYP1A were observed. Roach from the Ural and Ily River Deltas and roach and goby from the two stations nearest the Caspian Sea oil fields displayed higher levels of CYP1A expression in several organs than was observed in fish from further offshore. Great sturgeon and Russian sturgeon showed higher levels of CYP1A expression than was seen in starred sturgeon and gobies in the Ural delta. No fish showed evidence of contaminant-related histopathologies in the organs examined, despite the elevated CYP1A levels. Low levels of polychlorinated biphenyls and elevated levels of inshore and riverine petroleum hydrocarbons from these habitats suggest that this ongoing hydrocarbon exposure, and that from natural sources and long-term oil exploration on the Northeastern Caspian shore, contributed to the CYP1A induction observed.

The Modern Hydrochemical Regime of Lake Ladoga as an Indicator of Changes in Its Ecosystem	WATER RESOURCES												The changes in the regime of the hydrochemical parameters of Lake Ladoga most closely related to the production-destruction balance are analyzed: the concentration of total and mineral phosphorus, the value of pH, and the relative oxygen content in water. The parameters obtained during the open water period in the last 20 years are considered in comparison with previous observation periods. A decrease in the average weighted concentrations of inorganic phosphorus in the lake during the open-water period is noted as a result of its almost complete consumption in the hypolimnion of the deep-water zones of the lake in summer. These changes limit the primary production of phytoplankton and are accompanied by a decrease in the average values of pH during the open-water period, which in turn indirectly indicates a shift in the production-destruction balance towards an ever greater prevalence of organic matter destruction.

J	Ghanbari, RN; Bravo, HR				Ghanbari, Reza Namdar; Bravo, Hector R.			Coherence between atmospheric teleconnections, Great Lakes water levels, and regional climate	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES												We investigated the frequency domain relationships between four atmospheric teleconnections (Trans-Nino Index TNI, Pacific Decadal Oscillation PDO, Northern Annular Mode/Arctic Oscillation Index NAM/AO, and Pacific/North American PNA pattern) and water levels in the Great Lakes from 1948 to 2002 by quantifying the coherence between these time series. The levels in all Great Lakes are significantly correlated with the TNI in the frequency range (3-7)(-1) cycles year(-1), and with the PDO in interdecadal frequencies. The levels in Lakes Superior, Michigan, and Erie are significantly correlated with the PNA pattern in interdecadal frequencies, and the levels in all Great Lakes are significantly correlated with the NAM/AO in interannual frequencies. We investigated also the coherence, or "climate link", between atmospheric teleconnections and the Great Lakes regional climate, namely precipitation, evaporation, air temperature, and connecting channel flows, and the coherence, or "hydrologic link" between regional climate and lake levels. The effect of the teleconnections on lake levels is mostly transmitted through the "climate links" and the "hydrologic links", particularly through the channel inflows to Lakes Michigan, Erie, and Ontario. Connecting channel flows depend on the cumulative effect of upstream lakes and their watersheds and transmit interannual and interdecadal signals better than precipitation, evaporation, and air temperature.

Neither feeding the bacterium to the fish nor applying it directly to the gills caused systemic bacterial infection. Two consistent experimental challenges were developed for inducing furunculosis in juvenile brook trout: 15-min contact (bath) exposures of trout to about 106 A. salmonicida cells per ml of spring water and 60-s dip exposures of the fish to 109 A. salmonicida cells per ml. These challenge procedures produced 70-100% and 74-88% mortality, respectively, within 14 days after exposure. Results obtained with a strain of brook trout from Owhi Lake, Washington (USA), by the dip exposure method were affected by neither the age of the fish (up to 1 yr) nor the source of the population.

J	Lewin, J; Ashworth, PJ				Lewin, John; Ashworth, Philip J.			The negative relief of large river floodplains	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Large floodplains have multiple and complex negative relief assemblages in which depressions fall below local or general floodplain surfaces at a variety of scales. The generation and dynamics of negative relief along major alluvial corridors are described and compared. Such depressions are significant for the storage and passage of surface waters, the creation of a range of riparian, wetland, lacustrine and flowing-water habitats, and the long-term accumulation of organic materials. Working on trunk channel remnants, drowned valleys and subsidence basins, fluvial processes modify floodplain negative relief through differential erosion and sedimentation. Effectively this takes place in three genetic zones: rheic, transitional and perirheic. We show that transitional zones marginal to active channels significantly diversify form complexes, and we demonstrate the diachronous nature of zonal processes and the complex nature and pace of depression modification and infilling. Four less well-understood sets of coupled phenomena are assessed: (i) floodplains associated with discontinuous river banks, (ii) the scales and types of scroll bar generation, (iii) factors underlying the contrasts between meander and braidplain surface relief, and (iv) the generation and function of large floodplain wetlands and lakes. The survival likelihood of surface negative relief relates to geomorphological connectivity; this is described for each of the rheic, transitional and perirheic zones. The implications for contemporary aquatic system management are discussed. A key to understanding and managing negative relief on large river floodplains, and their associated ecologies and sedimentation, is to quantify both sedimentological and hydrological river-floodplain connectivity.

Remains of cladocerans are preserved in the sediment and may be used to trace historical changes in fish predation. We determined how contemporary data on planktivorous fish were related to the size of Daphnia ephippia (dorsal length) in the surface sediment (0-1 cm) of 52 mainly shallow lakes with contrasting densities of fish and nutrients (TP: 0.002-0.60 mg P l(-1)). Density of fish expressed as catch per unit effort, in terms of numbers in multiple mesh-sized gill nets (CPUEn), decreased significantly with increasing mean size of ephippia. The relationship was improved by adding TP as an independent variable, now explaining 90% of the variation in CPUEn on the full data set covering lakes in Denmark, Greenland and New Zealand, and 78% if only data on Danish lakes were used. CPUE by weight of planktivorous fish and mean weight of Daphnia in the pelagial during summer were also related to ephippial size. By including contemporary data on established relationships between the sizes of egg-bearing female Daphnia and ephippia, we inferred changes in the CPUEn, mean size of ephippia-bearing Daphnia and summer mean body weight of Daphnia from ephippial size in four lakes during the past 1-2 centuries. In a hypertrophic lake subject to periodic fish kills, Daphnia mean body weight was high and CPUEn was low compared with those in two eutrophic lakes, while CPUEn was low and Daphnia body weight was high in the least eutrophic, clearwater lake. Estimated CPUEn and Daphnia mean weight in the surface sediment of these four lakes corresponded well with contemporary data. Only small changes in ephippial size with time were observed in the clearwater lake and in one of the lakes that had suffered early eutrophication, while major changes occurred in the two other lakes that had been subjected to a major increase in nutrient input or fish kills. We conclude that Daphnia ephippia preserved in the surface sediments of lakes may be a useful and efficient method to quantify the present-day abundance of planktivorous fish and Daphnia mean size. The method is particularly valid in surveys aimed to give a general picture of the fish stock and the ecological state in a set of lakes in a region rather than a precise estimate for a single lake. Though some evidence is provided, more work is needed to evaluate whether the equations are valid for hind-casting in down-core palaeoecological studies.					; Lauridsen, Torben/JAX-3118-2023; Jeppesen, Erik/A-4463-2012; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019	Lauridsen, Torben/0000-0003-0139-2395; Jeppesen, Erik/0000-0002-0542-369X; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				JAN	2002	27	1					133	143		10.1023/A:1013561208488	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1013561208488													WOS:000173086500010

Organic matter of the second type is primary and biogenic and probably represents the metamorphosed remnants of cyanobacterial mats. It consists of finely laminated kerogens with high reflectance (%Ro(max) = 4.02-7.31) and high bireflectance. Under cross-polars it shows a textural pattern similar to that of thinly laminated organic matter. The level of thermal maturation is in the range of prehnite-pumpellyite to lower greenschist metamorphic facies. The first type consists of homogeneous, globular, migrated bitumen. These bitumens are isotropic to weakly anisotropic with a reflectance ranging from 0.72 to 1.32% (Ro(max)). Globular bitumen is essentially unmetamorphosed and follows the ''normal'' bitumen maturation pathway. Both types of organic matter have contributed to the uraniferous mineralization of the Elliot Lake region.																			0090-8312					APR-JUN	1993	15	2					339	357		10.1080/00908319308909030	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00908319308909030													WOS:A1993LF73100008

Long-term changes in phytoplankton in a humic lake in response to the water level rising: the effects of beaver engineering on a freshwater ecosystem	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												Although water level changes are supposed to be a key factor affecting the functioning of lake ecosystems, knowledge on this topic is scarce, particularly for humic lakes. This paper presents the results of 18 years' research on a small humic lake exposed to hydrological change (rising of the water level), which was induced by spontaneous colonization of the lake by the European beaver (Castor fiber L.). We put forward a hypothesis that this change will be reflected in the quantity and structure of summer phytoplankton due to expected changes in the water chemistry. We noted a statistically significant decrease in total phosphorus and calcium concentrations, electrolytic conductivity, and Secchi disc transparency, and an increase in water color. The phytoplankton structure changed, with cyanoprocaryota and greens decreasing and flagellates increasing. The alteration was observed in a lake which had previously been drained by ditches, so beaver damming appeared to cause the return of the lake to its original endorheic conditions as well as to a water chemistry and phytoplankton structure more typical of undisturbed humic lakes.

J	Koed, A; Balleby, K; Mejlhede, P				Koed, A; Balleby, K; Mejlhede, P			Migratory behaviour of adult pikeperch (Stizostedion lucioperca) in a lowland river	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The behaviour of radio-tagged adult pikeperch (Stizostedion lucioperca (L.)) from two areas in the Danish River Gudenaa were recorded prior to, and during the spawning period. Eight of 13 tagged fish in the lower reaches of the river were located throughout the whole study. Five of these fish moved upstream to various sites in the river prior to spawning, which occurred from late April to June. The three remaining fish moved to the fjord. These movements were interpreted as a spawning migration, and it is suggested that the lower reaches of the River Gudenaa constitute an over-wintering area for pikeperch, which use different spawning areas. Ten pikeperch caught just downstream of an impassable hydropower plant were radio-tagged and translocated upstream of the dam to a reservoir. Within a week, half of the fish moved to a lake situated more than 30 km upstream the reservoir. This behaviour is hypothesised to be a homing response. The study reveals that the pikeperch is a highly mobile species with a complicated migration pattern, even in relatively small river systems.

J	Li, JJ; Chen, YS; Wang, Z				Li, Jingjing; Chen, Yingshu; Wang, Zhe			Effect of pollution load reduction on water quality in rural lakes in the shallow hill water network area	WATER SUPPLY												There is poor water environment quality in rural lakes in the shallow hill water network area north of Han River in Chinese Jianghan Plaindue to their poor hydrodynamic conditions. We herein selected 10 typical rural lakes to simulate the water environment improvement. The hydrodynamic and water quality models were built based on MIKE21, while the simulation compared the year-round trends in lake water quality in the current and planning year, and demonstrated the possibility of recharging rural lakes from the backbone of Han River-Three Inland Rivers networks. The results show that the water quality of the 10 lakes has improved significantly after pollution control, with an improvement rate of more than 70%. Pollution interception and management are particularly successful for improving lake water quality in rural lakes. The replenish water from the backbone river to the lakes could enhance the fluidity of the rural lakes but cannot eliminate the TP risk. Therefore, in the relatively closed water bodies of rural lakes in the shallow hilly water network area, pollution intercept and control is key to controlling TP, and taking measures such as increasing lake hydrodynamic conditions in summer will be a more efficient approach to improve rural lake water quality.																			1606-9749	1607-0798				JUL	2022	22	7					6213	6229		10.2166/ws.2022.244	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/ws.2022.244		JUN 2022											WOS:000818088100001

A Great Lakes Coastal Wetland Invertebrate Community Gradient: Relative Influence of Flooding Regime and Vegetation Zonation	WETLANDS												Wetland invertebrate community composition is affected by habitat conditions associated with flooding regimes and vegetation characteristics, yet distinguishing among these influential factors is difficult because they tend to co-vary spatially. We studied a Great Lakes coastal wetland invertebrate community along an elevation gradient as Lake Huron water level rose and fell over a three-year period. This hydrologic variation caused changes in the gradient of flooding conditions, while plant zonation remained relatively unchanged. Multivariate analysis indicated that the invertebrate community varied continuously along the elevation gradient, and that it changed substantially within vegetation zones as water level changed. Variation across the gradient decreased because the high-elevation wet meadow community became more similar to lower-elevation communities as a result of upslope expansion in distributions of many taxa, and substantial increases in dominance of a subset of taxa. Invertebrate density increased dramatically with high-water conditions, and diversity decreased in general. Results suggested that invertebrate community composition was influenced by flooding conditions more than vegetation. These results may have important implications for conservation of high-elevation wetland zones as high-water refuges for wet-meadow invertebrates, and for coastal wetland monitoring schemes based on vegetation zones as habitat for particular invertebrate assemblages.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				APR	2011	31	2					329	341		10.1007/s13157-010-0140-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-010-0140-9													WOS:000289288700013
J	Mao, YH; Chen, YF; Chu, L; Zhang, XL				Mao, Yuehong; Chen, Yufei; Chu, Lin; Zhang, Xiaoli			Electrodeposited apatite coating for solid-phase microextraction and sensitive indirect voltammetric determination of fluoride ions	TALANTA												Electrodeposition was used to prepare a new solid phase microextraction (SPME) coatings. Two apatite SPME coatings, dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD or brushite) and hydroxyapatite (HAP) were validly and homogeneously one-step electrodeposited on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) under different conditions. The coatings were characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM, CV and EIS. The apatite SPME coatings showed excellent and selective adsorbability to fluoride ions. A novel indirect voltammetric strategy for sensitive detection of fluoride was proposed using K3Fe(CN)(6) as indicating probe. The detection principle of fluoride ions was based on the increment of steric hindrance after fluoride adsorption, which resulting in the decrease of the amperometric signal to Fe(CN)(6)(3-). The liner ranges were 0.5-20.0 mu mol/L for n-DCPD/GCE with the limit of detection of 0.14 mu mol/L and 0.1-50.0 mu mol/L for n-HAP/GCE with the limit of detection of 0.069 mu mol/L, respectively. The developed method was applied to the analysis of water samples (lake, spring and tap water) and the recovery values were found to be in the range of 90-106%. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Hydroacoustic study of spatial and temporal distribution of Gymnocypris przewalskii (Kessler, 1876) in Qinghai Lake, China	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Gymnocypris przewalskii (Kessler 1876) is an endangered and state-protected rare fish species in Qinghai Lake, China. To further understand the life history and distribution of this fish, five surveys were carried out in Qinghai Lake between 2002-2006. Results of these surveys indicate that fishes were predominantly distributed about 2 m under the surface. In July, significant differences in fish density were found between surface and bottom layers (P = 0.001), and/or between middle and bottom layers (P = 0.025). Fish density was the greatest in the surface layer. In August and October, no significant differences were found between the different layers, but the bottom layer had a greater fish density. Furthermore, there were very large differences among different zones in fish distribution density. Differences in horizontal distribution were not significantly correlated to factors such as water depth and inshore distance, possibly because of very low and uniform fish density. Feeding, changes in water temperature, over-wintering and spawning appeared to influence fish distribution. Hydroacoustic estimates of G. przewalskii biomass in Qinghai Lake increased significantly between 2002 and 2006. We attribute this increase to the management measures put in place to protect this species.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				JAN	2009	84	2					231	239		10.1007/s10641-008-9430-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-008-9430-y													WOS:000263010400015

The lake and the surrounding wetlands are characterized by a high degree of biodiversity with reference to the species and natural habitats, so it has been recognized as a "Ramsar Site". The lake is a typical shallow lagoon lake, which is subjected to human activities such as discharge of sewage. In order to evaluate the biotic community and estimate the pollution level, the physical and chemical variables and plankton dynamics were investigated during the study period. The plankton composition was typical for an eutrophic ecosystem. Cyanophyta and Chlorophyta. mainly were the dominant algal assemblages in terms of abundance. The zooplankton community was dominated by Rotifers (Brachionus and Keratella), whereas small Cladocera (Chydorus sphaericus and Bosmina longirostris) was also important in fall months. Primary production ranged between 569 and 4303 mg C m(-2) day(-1), while chlorophyll a ranged between 4.12 and 541.5 mg m(-3). The chlorophyll a content indicated also that the lake was eutrophic with hypertrophic tendency.

Features of the Life Cycles of Copepods in Different Areas of Lake Onego	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY												The study of the features of the life cycle of planktonic copepods, which allow species to adapt to the impact of various environmental factors, is one of the topical areas of ecological evolutionary developmental biology (Eco-Devo). Based on the analysis of the data of long-term research, the features of the ontogeny of common Copepoda species (Limnocalanus macrurus Sars, 1863, Eudiaptomus gracilis (Sars, 1863), Mesocyclops leuckarti (Claus, 1857), Thermocyclops oithonoides (Sars, 1863) in plankton of Lake Onego were studied. Comparison of the characteristics of the life cycles of species from different areas of the lake made it possible to identify the influence of the temperature factor. The thermal regime determines the timing of development of age stages of crustaceans in regions. The earliest dates for the onset of reproduction and development were noted in Petrozavodsk Bay and the Kizhi Skerries region. In spring, in Petrozavodsk Bay, the onset of development was observed 2-3 decades earlier for L. macrurus and 1-2 decades earlier for E. gracilis, M. leuckarti, and T. oithonoides than in the central region of the lake. In June, lower average quantitative indicators of copepods in Petrozavodsk Bay were recorded than those in the central region of the lake. According to our data, there were no noticeable changes in Copepoda abundance in Lake Onego from 1988 to 2020. This can be explained by the preservation of natural conditions for the habitat of crustaceans in Lake Onego.

J	LaRussa, M; Vermette, S				LaRussa, M; Vermette, S			A re-examination of the climatological impact of the Lake Erie-Niagara ice boom on Buffalo, New York	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A seasonal ice boom was first installed across the eastern end of Lake Erie in 1964-65. The ice boom was designed to reduce disruptions of hydroelectric power generation caused by ice flow down the Niagara River. A period of extended lake ice and cool springs in the subsequent years was attributed, by some, to the presence of the ice boom. Research studies conducted in the 1970s and 1980s showed no statistically significant relationship between the ice boom and water temperatures, and the local climate, through the months of March, April, and May. The reviewed studies may be considered inconclusive in demonstrating a local climate effect, mostly because of insufficient data and reporting in the midst of a regional cooling trend. In addition, the air temperature data were taken from the Greater Buffalo International Airport located 16 kms inland from the ice boom. This study extends the climate research to include the years to present and, for the first time, adds an additional analysis of mean monthly air temperature data obtained from a Buffalo shoreline location. Pre- and post-ice boom seasonal ice dissipation, water temperatures, and monthly mean air temperatures were analyzed for the months of March, April and May. The additional post-ice boom years, as well as the new shoreline data, reaffirm that the ice boom has had no statistically significant impact on water temperatures and on air temperatures in the vicinity of Buffalo, NY.																			0380-1330						2005	31	3					288	295		10.1016/S0380-1330(05)70260-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(05)70260-4													WOS:000232425200005

J	Lindblade, KA				Lindblade, KA			The epidemiology of cercarial dermatitis and its association with limnological characteristics of a northern Michigan lake	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY												Cercarial dermatitis (swimmer's itch) is an annoying inflammatory response to penetration of skin by non-human schistosome parasites while swimming or wading in lakes. The purpose of this survey was to identify risk factors for cercarial dermatitis and to determine whether limnological characteristics of the lake were associated with development of the condition. Starting 1 June 1993, an active case surveillance system was established in the communities around Walloon Lake, Michigan, which continued until 30 August 1993; controls were randomly selected weekly during the same time period through telephone surveys. A total of 317 cases of cercarial dermatitis occurring in 146 clusters was identified over the course of the summer and 295 controls were selected from the weekly telephone surveys. Factors associated with the development of cercarial dermatitis identified in the study included age, the time of day at which exposure to lake water occurred, and the month in which exposure to lake water took place. In addition, development of cercarial dermatitis was significantly associated with exposure to lake water in the area of the lake with the highest algae content and shallowest depth.

These taxa indicated a triacmic (three-peaked) annual growth pattern (less well-defined in lake Amvrakia), one peak coinciding with the spring phytoplankton bloom, and the other two occurring from the middle to the end of stratification. C. trichonidea seems to be highly dependent upon the availability of P and N, its abundance showing a positive response to higher P concentration values. Although successive decline in nitrate and phosphates seems to regulate the growth of the species C. trichonidea, the smaller-sized variety parva still flourishes and remains the most competitive phytoplankter. Both taxa also seem to tolerate the very low silica concentrations prevailing during stratification, provided that nitrogen and phosphorus are available for their subsequent abundance peaks.

To accomplish this, I instituted a field survey with sampling on January 2009. I collected nine submerged macrophyte species during the diving operation. Sample collection showed that submerged macrophytes flourished on both sides of the river but did not flourish in the central portion of the river. Alien species (Egeria densa and Elodea nuttallii) were collected on all survey lines, while domestic species (Ceratophyllum demersum, Myriophyllum spicatum, Hydrilla verticillata, Vallisneria biwaensis, Vallisneria denseserrulata, Potamogeton maackianus, and Potamogeton malaianus) were collected in large amounts on the survey lines near Lake Biwa. The dominant species in cohesive soil or fine soil was Egeria densa, while the dominant species in sand gravel was Potamogeton maackianus. Although Egeria densa was collected in sand gravel too, Potamogeton maackianus was not collected in cohesive soil or fine soil, which indicates that Egeria densa has high fertility and can survive in an oxygen-poor environment, while Potamogeton maackianus cannot survive in an oxygen-poor environment.

The isotopic profiles of the shells are visibly marked by three growth stages, linked with a progressive loss of environmental record because of declining intra-annual biocarbonate accretion rate. The juvenile and gerontic phases exhibit generally more positive and stable (plateau) isotopic pattern than the mid-age stage. An increasing delta C-13 trend is typical for the final life stage, likely influenced by nutrient overloading, reversing the tendency towards C-13 depletion throughout the individual's life induced by metabolic processes. Due to the progressive loss of environmental signals through ontogeny, these initial and final isotopic profile segments probably correspond to, respectively, an instant signature of the first season growth, and a multiyear value set of summer maxima during geriatric stage. Vague seasonal cyclic record is the striking feature of the mid-age delta O-18 and delta C-13 profile slices. In case of low-amplitude delta O-18 curve, this is probably promoted by a sensitivity of the lake ecosystem to many dynamic intra-annual factors affecting water budget balance. This consistent signature mode seems to be typical for lake-dwelling unionid shells at least since Miocene from different climatic zones, as confirmed by coeval lacustrine low-latitude mussels from Amazonia. Thus, this isotope record is relevant to obtain information on the habitat and life cycle of the fossil freshwater bivalves, as well as could help to understand modern environmental change.

J	Buchanan, B				Buchanan, B			Folsom lithic procurement, tool use, and replacement at the Lake Theo site, Texas	PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST												Folsom technological organization is examined from the perspective of the Lake Theo site (41BI70). Lake Theo is a stratified, multi-component site located on the southern Plains. Lake Theo is unique in that it is the only Folsom bison kill on the southern Plains located in proximity to a high-quality chert source (Tecovas jasper). Analysis of the Folsom lithic assemblage recovered from the site focuses on defining patterns of raw material procurement, tool use, and manufacture. The results suggest lithic stores of transported chert were depleted and points and tools replaced over a number of retooling events. At the site, local raw materials were used expediently to aid in the processing of the kill and in the production of tools for future use. Tools transported to the site were made primarily of Edwards and Alibates chert. The assemblages of Edwards and Alibates exhibit different degrees of depletion and suggest a visit to Edwards quarries was made subsequent to a visit to Alibates quarries. It is postulated that Folsom groups may have hunted annually on the southern High Plains and traveled south and east toward the Edwards Plateau during the winter months.

Factors Influencing the Occurrence of Inundated Playa Wetlands During Winter on the Texas High Plains	WETLANDS												Frequency and duration of playa inundation (i.e., hydroperiod) are major influences on the spatial and temporal distribution of flora and fauna in the western Great Plains. We used a 10-year data set of 221 playa wetlands to develop models of factors influencing the probability of a playa being flooded during January. We evaluated the relative influence of landscape and precipitation variables on the probability of a playa being inundated during January. Of the surveyed playas, 67% were inundated in >= 1 year and 33% never contained water in January. Our selected model indicated that the proportion of grassland in the watershed, mean annual rainfall, the previous year's total rainfall, and playa size as variables in the top ranked models for the probability of a playa being inundated during January. Proportion of grassland in the watershed had the largest positive effect. The probability of a playa being inundated during January increased from west to east across the THP and on average, we would expect individual playas to be inundated approximately once every 11 years, with similar to 30% of the playas inundated at a frequency greater than 1 year out of 10. Playas with cropland watersheds had diminished hydrologic function.

On the one hand, the dams themselves have a high value, having implications for the whole economy, through the production of electricity, water supply systems for irrigation and flood prevention, etc. On the other hand, structural damage of a dam can lead to major disasters, the population exposure to effects caused by sudden floods. The situation in Romania is such a kind that should be given to the future safety of existing dams. The first reason is that these dams were designed and constructed on the basis of technical rules, which the majority are no longer in force, a second reason is the major climate changes in the last period, which have led to the volume of water in increasingly large lakes in the accumulation of them. A third reason logically, is the length of existing dams.

About 80% of the landslides were found in the eastern margin of the Tibet plateau, which exhibits active tectonic activities. Intensive interactions between the endogenic and epigenetic geological processes cause serious dynamic change of high steep slopes. Large-scale landslides in this region are attributed to strong earthquake, extreme weather conditions and global climatic changes. In southern China, heavy storm with an intensity of 200-300 mm/d is also a crucial factor to triger large-scale landslides. Frozen-thawing of soils in spring is another main cause of many landslides in the loess aera of northwestern China. Recently, global warming-caused temperature rising induces glacier retreat and glacier lake collapse, etc. In general, more than 70% of the large-scale landslides were closely related to the human activities.																					978-0-415-41196-7				2008							2037	2053		10.1201/9780203885284-c284	http://dx.doi.org/10.1201/9780203885284-c284													WOS:000266239200284

Using both experimental sediment-water chambers and field monitoring, this study assessed nutrient and metals cycling in the profundal zone of hypereutrophic Hodges Reservoir, San Diego (maximum depth = 29.1 m; maximum surface area = 6.0 km(2)). A focus of the study was methylmercury (MeHg), a toxic form of mercury that bioaccumulates in aquatic food webs. Results confirmed that oxic conditions repressed release of redox-sensitive compounds (e.g., MeHg, ammonia, phosphate, manganese) from profundal sediment, though high sediment oxygen demand complicated experimental efforts to maintain a well-oxygenated sediment-water interface. In both experimental chambers and in the reservoir, patterns of MeHg cycling correlated with manganese cycling, suggesting that moderately low redox conditions that stimulate reductive dissolution of manganese also enhance net Hg methylation. Sediment MeHg flux was tightly coupled with sulfate uptake under moderately reduced conditions, reinforcing the link between sulfate-reducing bacteria and Hg methylation. Results highlight the fact that hypolimnetic oxygenation in Hodges Reservoir using pure oxygen gas, which is planned for spring 2020, must maintain high oxygen concentrations at the profundal sediment-water interface. In addition, results indicate that the presence of manganese in surface water can be used as an indicator of oxygenation's effectiveness in lowering rates of internal nutrient and MeHg loading.

Rao			A simulation study of atmospheric mercury and its deposition in the Great Lakes	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												The Great Lakes eco-region is one of the largest sources of fresh water in North America; however it is chronically exposed to heavy metal loadings such as mercury. In this study a comprehensive model evaluation was conducted to determine mercury loadings to the Great Lakes. The study also evaluated the relative impact of anthropogenic mercury emissions from China, regional and global sources on deposition to the Great Lakes. For the 2005 study period, CMAQ4.7.1 model estimated a total of 6.4 +/- 0.5 metric tons of mercury deposited in the Great Lakes. The total deposition breakdown showed a net loading for Lake Superior of 1906 +/- 246 kg/year which is the highest of all the lakes. Lake Michigan followed with 1645 +/- 203 kg/year and 1511 +/- 107 kg/year in Lake Huron. The lowest total deposition was seen in Lakes Erie and Ontario amassing annual totals of 837 +/- 107 kg and 506 +/- 63 kg, respectively. Wet and dry deposition of mercury were both significant pathways and exhibited strong seasonal variability with higher deposition occurring in the warmer months (June November) and the lowest in winter. Wet deposition of RGM significantly influenced the deposition proportions accounting for roughly 90% of all mercury deposited. Of the three emission sources (global background, integrated planning management (IPM) and Chinese), global background concentrations represented the maximum impact to deposition loading in the Great Lakes, except for Lake Erie and parts of Lake Michigan. There was minimal seasonality for the global background, but differences in percentage contribution between dry (28-97%) and wet deposition (43-98%) was predicted. The contributions were seen mainly in the northern sections of the Great Lakes further away from IPM point sources. These findings suggest strong localized impact of IPM sources on the southernmost lakes. Deposition as a result of emissions from China exhibited seasonality in both wet and dry deposition and showed significant contributions ranging from 0.2 to 9%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Limnological controls on stable isotope records of late-Holocene palaeoenvironment change in SW Greenland: a paired lake study	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Stable isotope records are increasingly being used in palaeoenvironmental studies of Arctic lakes. Here we compare stable isotope and elemental records (delta C-13, delta N-15 C/N) with high resolution XRF-derived geochemical and colour data from low Arctic lakes (SS1220 and SS85) in southwest Greenland. Lake SS1220 sediments are laminated gyttja whereas SS85 consist of homogeneous gyttja, both records cover the last c. 5000 years. delta C-13 and carbon content suggest that organic matter in both lakes is predominantly autochthonous. The C/N variability, ranging between 11 and 15, is interpreted to be a function of nitrogen deficiency which is further supported by delta N-15 values (at SS1220) falling close to atmospheric delta N-15(atmosphere). Although some changes in the geochemical stratigraphies presented here can be related to regional environmental change (i.e. hydrology, effective precipitation, aeolian activity), these effects are filtered through the lake catchments. These changes alter the nutrient supply and hence lake productivity which appear to be the primary controls on the stable isotope data. We suggest that information of past environmental change can only be gained from the stable isotope composition of lake sediments when there is a reasonable understanding of limnological processes, and records may be lake specific.

SITE DESCRIPTION AND GROUNDWATER-FLOW	GROUND WATER												The hydrogeology of the chemical waste disposal site in the closed basin at Alkali Lake, Oregon was examined. Interest in the site is due to the burial (Nov. 1976) or 25,000 drums of herbicide manufacturing residues in unlined trenches on the playa of the basin. Included in the wastes were large amounts of chlorophenols and polymeric chlorophenoxyphenols. The flow of the alkaline (pH .simeq. 10) ground water in the site area is driven by springs which create a mound east of the site, and the sump effect of West Alkali Lake, a topographic low to the west of the site. Porosity, bulk mass densities, and grain-size distributions were determined. At 1 piezometer, the depth to groundwater ranged 0.9-2.2 m. With the bottoms of the trenches in which the chemicals were buried 0.60-0.75 m below the level of the ground surface, the bottom portions of the trenches may, at least occasionally, be in direct contact with the ground water.																			0017-467X	1745-6584					1984	22	5					593	601		10.1111/j.1745-6584.1984.tb01430.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6584.1984.tb01430.x													WOS:A1984TF65300011

We experimentally tested the importance of these two processes for lake zooplankton communities by examining the ability of additional species to persist when introduced into mesocosms in Little Rock Lake, Wisconsin, from other nearby lakes in the Northern Highland Lake District. We established a control treatment with only Little Rock Lake zooplankton and two treatments that supplemented the Little Rock communities with zooplankton from nearby lakes. Species richness declined during the 3 weeks of the experiment so that, at the end of the third week, the treatments with added zooplankton species had the same number of species as the controls; increasing the initial number of species in the community did not increase its final species richness. A plot of the mean species richness in the local habitat against the mean species richness of the regional pool fell below a 1:1 slope. This suggested that local processes were more important in structuring Little Rock Lake zooplankton communities.					; Frost, Tanja/HGU-8832-2022	Arnott, Shelley/0000-0002-3834-703X; 													0142-7873	1464-3774				MAY	1999	21	5					991	1003		10.1093/plankt/21.5.991	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/21.5.991													WOS:000080424000009
J	Huang, GW; Isobe, M				Huang, Guangwei; Isobe, Masahiko			Carrying capacity of wetlands for massive migratory waterfowl	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Although it has been documented that waterfowl can cause water quality problems when their populations are large relative to the size or volume of the water body, the question as to how many waterbirds a wetland or a lake can support remains unanswered. A method to quantify the carrying capacity of a water body with regard to massive waterfowl was developed through the study of five wetlands that are used as the wintering ground by a large number of waterfowl in Japan. It takes into consideration water depth, retention time, and in-lake phosphorus concentration. For one of the sites, Sakata Lagoon, which is a registered Ramsar wetland in Japan, the assessment of its carrying capacity suggests that the number of waterfowl should be reduced by half to sustain the water quality of this wetland. Based on the comparison among the five wetlands, a simple indicator was proposed for quick diagnosis. Moreover, a general plot of permissible loading of phosphorus (kg/ha/year) by waterfowl was presented. Besides, this study shed some new light on potential toxicity and accumulation of waterfowl feces at lakebed. Finally, a proposal to increase the carrying capacity of Sakata Lagoon is discussed.																			0018-8158					NOV	2012	697	1					5	14		10.1007/s10750-012-1165-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1165-2													WOS:000307886000002
J	Bradbury, JP; VanMetre, PC				Bradbury, JP; VanMetre, PC			A land-use and water-quality history of White Rock Lake reservoir, Dallas, Texas, based on paleolimnological analyses	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												White Rock Lake reservoir in Dallas, Texas contains a 150-cm sediment record of silty clay that documents land-use changes since its construction in 1912. Pollen analysis corroborates historical evidence that between 1912 and 1950 the watershed was primarily agricultural. Land disturbance by plowing coupled with strong and variable spring precipitation caused large amounts of sediment to enter the lake during this period. Diatoms were not preserved at this time probably because of low productivity compared to diatom dissolution by warm, alkaline water prior to burial in the sediments. After 1956, the watershed became progressively urbanized. Erosion decreased, land stabilized, and pollen of riparian trees increased as the lake water became somewhat less turbid. By 1986 the sediment record indicates that diatom productivity had increased beyond rates of diatom destruction. Neither increased nutrients nor reduced pesticides can account for increased diatom productivity, but grain size studies imply that before 1986 diatoms were light limited by high levels of turbidity. This study documents how reservoirs may relate to land-use practices and how watershed management could extend reservoir life and improve water quality.					; Van Cleave, Keith/AAN-2338-2021	Van Metre, Peter/0000-0001-7564-9814; 													0921-2728					FEB	1997	17	2					227	237		10.1023/A:1007923829759	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1007923829759													WOS:A1997WP40000005

On the basis of CTD profiles, the hydrothermal water is identified as forming an anomalous bottom layer with a higher temperature (> 0.15 degrees C) and salinity (> 2.5 mg . kg(-1)) than the overlying water. Due to the entrainment of lake water, a distinct dense water layer up to 40 m thick, stabilised by its slightly higher salinity, becomes established close to the bottom of the bay. The density current thus generated flows out of the bay towards the deeper parts of the basin. Since helium isotope analysis shows that the geochemical characteristics of the hydrothermal water are similar to those of water from nearby hot springs on land, the bottomwater of Frolikha Bay is easily interpreted in terms of the mixing of ordinary fresh water from the lake and hydrothermal water carrying isotopically heavy He from the continental crust. Because of its high crustal He content, a similar hydrothermal component may even be identified in the open water of the northern basin.

Lake level and climate records of the last 90 ka from the Northern Basin of Lake Van, eastern Turkey	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Sedimentary, geochemical and mineralogical analyses of the ICDP cores recovered from the Northern Basin (NB) of Lake Van provide evidence of lake level and climatic changes related to orbital and North Atlantic climate system over the last 90 ka. High lake levels are generally observed during the interglacial and interstadial periods, which are marked by deposition of varved sediments with high total organic carbon (TOC), total inorganic carbon (TIC), low detrital influx (high Ca/F) and high delta O-18 and delta C-13 values of authigenic carbonate. During the glacial and stadial periods of 71-58 ka BP (Marine Isotope Stage 4, MIS4) and end of last glaciation-deglaciation (30-14.5 ka BP; MIS3) relatively low lake levels prevailed, and grey homogeneous to faintly laminated clayey silts were deposited at high sedimentation and low organic productivity rates. Millennial-scale variability of the proxies during 60-30 ka BP (MIS3 is correlated with the Dansgaard -Oeschger (D-O)) and Holocene abrupt climate events in the Atlantic. These events are characterized by laminated sediments, with high TOC, TIC, Ca/Fe, delta O-18 and delta C-13 values. The Lake Van NB records correlate well in the region with the climate records from the lakes Zeribar and Urmia in Iran and the Sofular Cave in NW Anatolia, but are in general in anti-phase to those from the Dead Sea Basin (Lake Lisan) in the Levant. The relatively higher delta O-18 values (0 to -0.4 parts per thousand) for the interglacial and interstadial periods in the Lake Van NB section are due to the higher temperature and seasonality of precipitation and higher evaporation, whereas the lower values (-0.8 to -2 parts per thousand) during the glacial and stadia] periods are caused mainly by relative decrease in both temperature and seasonality of precipitation. The high delta O-18 values (up to 4.2 parts per thousand) during the Younger Dryas, together with the presence of dolomite and low TOC contents, supports evaporative conditions and low lake level. A gradual decrease in the delta O-18 values from an average of 0.4 parts per thousand during the humid early Holocene to an average of 3.5 parts per thousand during the more arid late Holocene suggests an increasing contribution of winter precipitation. The changes in the seasonality of precipitation in eastern Anatolia are probably caused by changes in the temperatures of North Atlantic and Mediterranean and in the strength of Siberian High.

THE ENVIRONMENT CANADA PAN AND PARAPAN AMERICAN SCIENCE SHOWCASE PROJECT	BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												The Pan and Parapan American Games (PA15) are the third largest sporting event in the world and were held in Toronto in the summer of 2015 (10-26 July and 7-15 August). This was used as an opportunity to coordinate and showcase existing innovative research and development activities related to weather, air quality (AQ), and health at Environment and Climate Change Canada. New observational technologies included weather stations based on compact sensors that were augmented with black globe thermometers, two Doppler lidars, two wave buoys, a 3D lightning mapping array, two new AQ stations, and low-cost AQ and ultraviolet sensors. These were supplemented by observations from other agencies, four mobile vehicles, two mobile AQ laboratories, and two supersites with enhanced vertical profiling. High-resolution modeling for weather (250 m and 1 km), AQ (2.5 km), lake circulation (2 km), and wave models (250-m, 1-km, and 2.5-km ensembles) were run. The focus of the science, which guided the design of the observation network, was to characterize and investigate the lake breeze, which affects thunderstorm initiation, air pollutant transport, and heat stress. Experimental forecasts and nowcasts were provided by research support desks. Web portals provided access to the experimental products for other government departments, public health authorities, and PA15 decision-makers. The data have been released through the government of Canada's Open Data Portal and as a World Meteorological Organization's Global Atmospheric Watch Urban Research Meteorology and Environment dataset.					; Vanos, Jennifer/S-1552-2017; Jeong, Cheol/AAV-4322-2020; Shairsingh, Kerolyn/JXY-0854-2024; Vanos, Jennifer/AAO-3146-2020	gultepe, ismail/0000-0002-8433-5953; Mariani, Zen/0000-0001-9368-5659; Vanos, Jennifer/0000-0003-1854-9096; Voogt, James/0000-0002-7975-0052; Shairsingh, Kerolyn/0000-0002-9529-3322; Lin, Hai/0000-0003-4353-0426; Leroyer, Sylvie/0000-0003-1468-0978; 													0003-0007	1520-0477				MAY	2018	99	5					921	953		10.1175/BAMS-D-16-0162.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-16-0162.1													WOS:000433893400007
J	Weiershäuser, L; Spooner, ETC				Weiershäuser, L; Spooner, ETC			Seafloor hydrothermal fluids, Ben Nevis area, Abitibi Greenstone Belt: Implications for Archean (∼2.7 Ga) seawater properties	PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH												A central part of the similar to 2.7 Ga Abitibi Greenstone Belt, between the Destor-Porcupine and Cadillac-Larder Lake structures, has been subjected to sub-greenschist facies metamorphism (T < 300 degrees C). Quartz-filled vesicles and interstitial and drainage cavity quartz from pillowed flows are considered to be the best host for Archean seawater-related fluid inclusions. Petrology revealed primary depositional textures, indicating a lack of significant metamorphism or recrystallization. Hence, the material is considered to be of primary origin, containing primary, Archean trapped fluids. The majority of observed fluid inclusions are two-phase and liquid-dominated with a vapor bubble volume of similar to 10%. Microthermometry on 58 samples (similar to 1100 fluid inclusions) and eutectic temperatures between -45 and -30 degrees C indicate the presence of at least one significant divalent cation in the fluids; hence, salinity is calculated as wt.% CaCl2 equiv. The peak of the salinity distribution of inclusions from vesicles, and interstitial and drainage cavity quartz, falls between similar to 4 and similar to 10 wt.% CaCl2 equiv.; a small subset of inclusions yielded salinities between 18 and 22 wt.% CaCl2 equiv. Most homogenization temperatures fall in an interval between similar to 110 and similar to 160 degrees C. A geothermal gradient estimated from the data of similar to 10-15 degrees C/km is reasonable and consistent with the interpretation of the area as a regional seafloor recharge zone. Primary porosity in the modem ocean floor does not show the rapid precipitation of quartz that is indicated for the Archean; however, the global occurrence of silica-rich banded iron formations and the lack of silica consuming marine organisms in the Precambrian indicates that marine geochemistry and SiO2-precipitation mechanisms may have been different during the Precambrian. The total salinity of a fluid is dependent primarily on its total chlorinity; hence water-rock interactions with ion exchange cannot be the only reason for the higher salinities encountered in this study. Indications for boiling or high temperature phase separation are not evident, suggesting that these options are not a reason for the observed high salinities. Our data are in agreement with six other data sets-from the 3.75 Ga Isua Greenstone Belt (W. Greenland), the 3.24 Ga Pilbara region (W. Australia), the similar to 3.2 Ga Barberton Greenstone Belt (South Africa; 2), the similar to 2.7 Ga Matagami area (Abitibi Greenstone Belt, Canada), and the Proterozoic (similar to 2.2 Ga) Ongeluk Formation (South Africa). The consistency of fluid inclusion data suggests that Archean and early Proterozoic seawater may have been more saline, and potentially stratified, compared to modem seawater. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The test is directed primarily to lake managers of shallow, eutrophic lakes in order to enhance the performance of new biomanipulation projects. A prerequisite for success is that at least 75% of the planktivorous and benthivorous fish are removed from the lake. The chance for a clear-water period after fish reduction is determined by the opportunities for large Daphnia species and by the impact of benthivorous fish and wind on sediment resuspension. A bloom of filamentous Cyanobacteria (> 100000 ind./ml) and large numbers of mysid shrimp (Neomysis spp. > 100 ind./m2) in early spring may prevent the development of Daphnia and consequently a decrease in algal biomass.

Wintertime spatial distribution of ammonia and its emission sources in the Great Salt Lake region	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Ammonium-containing aerosols are a major component of wintertime air pollution in many densely populated regions around the world. Especially in mountain basins, the formation of persistent cold-air pools (PCAPs) can enhance particulate matter with diameters less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) to levels above air quality standards. Under these conditions, PM2.5 in the Great Salt Lake region of northern Utah has been shown to be primarily composed of ammonium nitrate; however, its formation processes and sources of its precursors are not fully understood. Hence, it is key to understanding the emission sources of its gas phase precursor, ammonia (NH3). To investigate the formation of ammonium nitrate, a suite of trace gases and aerosol composition were sampled from the NOAA Twin Otter aircraft during the Utah Winter Fine Particulate Study (UWFPS) in January and February 2017. NH3 was measured using a quantum cascade tunable infrared laser differential absorption spectrometer (QC-TILDAS), while aerosol composition, including particulate ammonium (pNH(4)), was measured with an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS). The origin of the sampled air masses was investigated using the Stochastic TimeInverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model and combined with an NH3 emission inventory to obtain model-predicted NHx (= NH3 pNH(4)) enhancements. Enhancements represent the increase in NH3 mixing ratios within the last 24 h due to emissions within the model footprint. Comparison of these NIL, enhancements with measured NIL, from the Twin Otter shows that modelled values are a factor of 1.6 to 4.4 lower for the three major valleys in the region. Among these, the underestimation is largest for Cache Valley, an area with intensive agricultural activities. We find that one explanation for the underestimation of wintertime emissions may be the seasonality factors applied to NH3 emissions from livestock. An investigation of inter-valley exchange revealed that transport of NH3 between major valleys was limited and PM2.5 in Salt Lake Valley (the most densely populated area in Utah) was not significantly impacted by NH3 from the agricultural areas in Cache Valley. We found that in Salt Lake Valley around two thirds of NHx originated within the valley, while about 30 % originated from mobile sources and 60 % from area source emissions in the region. For Cache Valley, a large fraction of NOx potentially leading to PM2.5 formation may not be locally emitted but mixed in from other counties.

We employ changes in the grain size distribution to reflect the water level in the floodplain lake, with a higher percentage of the finer fraction indicating higher water level and vice versa. The n-alkane molecular distribution, average chain length (ACL), and P-aq ratio (C-23+C-25)/(C-23+C-25+C-29+C-31) are used to reflect mainly vegetation composition that is also sensitive to water depth. Our results reveal that the lake water level was relatively low and gradually increased from 4 to 2.7 ka. The period from 2.7 to 1.2 ka exhibited the highest late-Holocene lake water level in this region. The water level then decreased toward the present. This paleohydrological reconstruction agrees with existing paleoclimate reconstructions of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, confirming that the intensity of Asian monsoon rains is an important factor in affecting paleohydrological changes in this region.

Anders			Biomanipulating streams: a supplementary tool in lake restoration	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Removal of cyprinid fish is a widely used biomanipulation tool to transform turbid shallow eutrophic lakes in north temperate regions into a clear water state. We here evaluate the removal of cyprinids from streams as a supplement to lake fishing. Since cyprinids often aggregate in high densities in lake inlet/outlet streams during winter migration, removal of fish in this space-confined habitat may be cost-efficient as compared to fish removal in the lake habitat. In two consecutive years, we annually removed up to 35% of the dominant cyprinids from an inlet stream to a lake and argue that this could easily be increased with a more targeted fishing effort. Concurrently, we monitored species- and length-specific variation in migration propensity, to explore how this relates to efficient fish removal. Smaller planktivores generally had a much higher migratory propensity than larger benthivores. Hence, stream fishing specifically targets species and size groups that are less efficiently controlled with traditional lake fishing methods. As a rule of thumb, stream fishing is most efficient when water temperature is 2-6 degrees C. Prior to implementing fish removals from streams, the potential evolutionary consequences of the targeted removal of migratory phenotypes should be considered.

However, little information is known about the water quality status and its relation with fish production in the Tono Reservoir. This study sought to assess water quality parameters and examine association among them as well as determine the correlation between the water quality parameters and fish catch per unit effort of the Tono Reservoir. A three-level stratified sampling was adopted and samples were collected on a monthly basis. Water quality parameters such as water level, temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, transparency, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, chloride, sulphate, phosphate-phosphorus, silica, nitrate-nitrogen, nitrite-nitrogen, chlorophyll-a, and fish catches were measured simultaneously from each of the three strata of the reservoir. The water quality parameters of the reservoir fell within the recommended range for fish production. Concentrations of water quality parameters for the riverine, transitional and lacustrine zones showed no significant difference (p > 0.05). Catch per unit effort correlated significantly positive with only chloride (r = 0.61, p < 0.05) attributable to fertilisers used on surrounding farm lands and carried by runoff or floods to the reservoir. The reservoir could be classified as mesotrophic based on chlorophyll-a concentration. It was recommended that the reservoir water quality should be monitored quarterly by the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development to ensure safe fish production.

(= before A.D. 2000); the timing is consistent with that seen in the Greenland ice-core data and various high-resolution records from western Europe. During maximal cooling at 8250-8150 yr B.P., the annual mean temperature in Estonia was similar to2.0 degreesC colder than prior to and similar to3.0 degreesC colder than after the cooling. The pollen-stratigraphic and sedimentological data suggest especially cold and snowy winter conditions. The duration and amplitude of the cold event agree with the modeled impact of a sudden freshening of the North Atlantic surface water and subsequent perturbation of the thermohaline circulation. Provided that the cold event was caused by a pulse of freshwater-from the melting Laurentide Ice Sheet-to the North Atlantic, the results indicate a strong teleconnection between the North Atlantic oceanic forcing and the east European climate at least up to long 26degreesE, mediated probably by the changing intensity of the zonal atmospheric circulation.

J	LULY, JG				LULY, JG			HOLOCENE PALEOENVIRONMENTS NEAR LAKE TYRRELL, SEMIARID NORTHWESTERN VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Pollen analyses from the playa Lake Tyrrell in semi-arid northwestern Victoria, Australia record major environmental changes during the Holocene. Amerioration of arid Pleistocene climates after 10,000 BP converted Lake Tyrrell from a dry deflationary basin to an ephemeral lake surrounded by Allocasuarina dominated woodlands with a grass understorey. A marked increase in rainfall at about 6600 BP transformed the lake from an ephemeral to a permanent water body. This increase in rainfall coincided with the migration of mallee vegetation to the region, a rapid expansion in Callitris populations and development of a more active fire regime. Drier conditions prevailed between 2200 BP and 800 BP but mallee remained the dominant vegetation. Fully modem conditions date from 800 BP. The magnitude of Holocene environmental change reported from Lake Tyrrell is greater than that usually recognized from sites in humid southeastern Australia. A comparison of conclusions drawn from Lake Tyrrell with previously published accounts from Lake Frome suggests that significant Holocene environmental change was widespread in the semi-arid lands of southeastern Australia.

It is well known that inappropriate use and disposal lead to the accumulation of plastic litter in different aquatic environments. Microbial biofilm is able to develop on the surface of plastics (plastisphere) in aquatic environments over time. The aim of this study was to describe the bacterial communities associated with plastics in freshwater. Thus, in our first test, a total of six self-designed plastic colonizers were submerged under the surface of the water in Vacszentlaszlo lake, located in central Hungary, for a period of 3 months. Two plastic colonizers were cultivated monthly. Associated microbial communities were then analyzed as follows: (a) bacterial communities were studied by amplicon sequencing and (b) culturable bacteria were isolated from plastic surfaces and identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Coinciding with these analyses of plastic colonizing communities, surface water samples from the lake were also taken, and in a second test, other materials (eg. wood, glass) associated bacterial communities were also investigated with the same methods. Amplicon sequencing showed notable differences between the plastic and other materials colonizing, and lake waterborne microbial community composition. Using the LB agar, no novel species were found; however, several known pathogenic species were identified. The self-designed plastic colonizer was successfully used during the winter over a 3-month period, suggesting that it could be an appropriate method of choice to study microplastic-associated microbes for longer periods and in variable environmental conditions.					; Szabó, István/JND-7921-2023	Farkas, Milan/0000-0002-7807-4750; Griffitts, Jeffrey/0000-0002-1518-0054; Szabo, Istvan/0000-0002-3954-799X													0049-6979	1573-2932				DEC	2021	232	12							493	10.1007/s11270-021-05445-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-021-05445-0													WOS:000723659600001

The geographical and ecological transition was revealed by large scale vegetation changes, and the climatic changes had been estimated during the Holocene based on comprehensive comparison and analysis of the paleoenvironmental records surrounding the study area. Meanwhile, multicultural exchanges were represented based on the spatial distributions of archaeological sites in the Neolithic and Bronze Age. It is proposed that repeated multicultural exchanges and integration were inferential responses to the complex spatial-temporal evolution of the climate, ecology and geography near the Nihewan-Huliu Basin, especially, diverse cultures converged here from different directions after the abrupt cold events or serious climate changes in the mid-Holocene; the spatial connectivity with intermontane rivers and basins provided potential pathways for sustainable multicultural exchanges among mountains; the North-South movement of the forest boundary compelled the formation of steppe-forest and farming-pastoral ecotone here, and finally formed an active multicultural core region with integrated human civilization in North China.					wang, xinyuan/HHM-2418-2022														1040-6182	1873-4553				FEB 25	2019	507				SI		53	61		10.1016/j.quaint.2019.01.035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2019.01.035													WOS:000464516500007

Both models were set up using the same horizontal and vertical discretisation and forced by a horizontally resolved wind field. Model simulations were carried out during a stable stratification period in summer. Oscillations of the simulated and the measured isotherms in Lake uberlingen (north basin of Upper Lake Constance) indicated the existence of a Kelvin-type wave with a period of 84h. The major wave pattern in period and amplitude was consistent between the simulations and the measurements, whereas discrepancies appeared in the phase match. The measured and the simulated vertical velocity structure in the middle of the main basin of Upper Lake Constance showed occurrence of a Poincare-type wave with a 14 h period. Major oscillations of the velocity structure were captured by both models, and the agreement between the simulations and the measurements was higher in deep layers than in near-surface layers. Model prediction of the near-surface velocities as well as the surface circulation pattern was more accurate under high current velocities during strong winds than under weak winds. This study concluded that both ELCOM and Delft3D were significantly skilled at simulating internal wave motions and surface currents, and there was no significant difference in reproducing the measured lake dynamics between ELCOM and Delft3D.					; Dissanayake, Pushpa/AAY-3616-2021	Hofmann, Hilmar/0000-0001-6140-5886; Dissanayake, Pushpa/0000-0003-2159-9940; 													2044-2041	2044-205X					2019	9	2			SI		239	260		10.1080/20442041.2019.1580079	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2019.1580079													WOS:000482317700009

Suitable habitat supply was estimated in three sections of the bay during the summers of 1972-2001 to assess its role in the decline. An empirical model was developed to predict suitable habitat area for walleyes based on their preferences for cool water and low light intensity. The results indicated that lack of suitable light limits walleye habitat in the bay. Walleye habitat in the shallow upper bay has decreased at the rate of 34 ha/year since the invasion of dreissenid mussels in 1994, while that in the middle and lower bays has remained abundant. Walleye stocks and suitable habitat in the upper bay have both declined since the early 1990s. However, this pattern has not been consistent through time and suggests that other factors have also affected the Bay of Quinte walleye population. The analyses developed here can be used as a tool to enhance the assessment of walleye habitat dynamics in the Bay of Quinte and allow us to examine the impact of oligotrophication on the habitat of an important recreational and commercial species.

Airborne carbon deposition on a remote forested lake	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Airborne inputs of terrestrial particulate organic carbon (TPOC) were measured during summer stratification for an oligotrophic north temperate lake located in a forested watershed. These inputs were episodic and associated with wind and rain events. The rate of deposition decreased exponentially with distance from shore. Yet, about 55% of the total airborne TPOC input occurred more than 12 m from shore on this 25.8 ha lake. Of total deposition, 39% was less than 153 mu m in diameter - a size fraction not commonly measured in prior studies. Average airborne deposition was 5 mg C m(-2) d(-1), which is consistent with measurements from other lakes and equivalent to about 1.1% of daily net primary production in our study lake. C:N ratios of TPOC were between 6:1 and 22:1 (molar), much lower than the values for terrestrial leaves which were between 39:1 and 48:1 (molar). These low C:N ratios suggest that TPOC may be a useful substrate for aquatic consumers and may supplement in-lake primary production as a food source, especially after wind and rain events when airborne TPOC inputs are high.

In this study, stable isotopic analysis of water (delta H-2 and delta O-18(H2O)) and sulfate (delta S-34 and delta O-18(SO4)) were completed and cataloged in 15 mine pit lakes in Nevada, USA, representing the most spatially distributed and largest dataset related to the isotopic composition of pit lakes yet presented in the literature. The isotopic composition of groundwater and surface springs was also included at several sites to more fully characterize the connected groundwater-surface water systems. Results of delta H-2 and delta O-18(H2O) analysis indicate that the pit lakes are highly evaporated (more so than natural lakes in the same region), although the strength of evaporative fractionation differs spatially. Pit lakes also vary in the degree to which they are enriched in heavy isotopes relative to influent groundwater, which gives insight into the basin-scale water budget for these areas. Isotopes of sulfate (delta S-34 and delta O-18(SO4)) and water (delta O-18(H2O)) were used to test several commonly-held models of sulfide oxidation, and results suggest that none of the applied models can fully explain the isotopic composition of pit-lake waters. Most sulfur isotope data suggest a mixed source of aqueous sulfate including the oxidation of pyrite and dissolution of sulfate salts.					; Newman, Connor/AAC-7372-2020	Newman, Connor/0000-0002-6978-3440; 													0375-6742	1879-1689				MAR	2020	210								106445	10.1016/j.gexplo.2019.106445	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gexplo.2019.106445													WOS:000512771200007

The geochemical and isotopic compositions of the waters provide insights into the processes occurring in the volcanic-hydrothermal system, the crater lake and the thermal springs. Variations in the temperature and chemical composition of the waters reveal fundamental changes in the system that precede and accompany the magmatic and phreatic eruptive events at Copahue. A conceptual model of the summit system was developed involving the intrusion of slivers of magma in the hot acidic hydrothermal cell, the saturation of waters with secondary minerals leading to reduced permeability, the blocking of fluid pathways by liquid sulphur during heating events and the transport of gas from the magma through the ductile-brittle transition into the hydrothermal system. Geophysical data were integrated with the chemical data to provide new insights into the behaviour of the deep magmatic system that feeds the volcano edifice. Multidisciplinary studies were used to identify precursory signals of eruptive activity to give an early warning of pending volcanic hazards. Several geochemical ratios in river water were identified as potential indicators of upcoming volcanic activity, which could be used in co-operation with the community and local authorities to deal with these volcanic hazards.					; Guevara, Sergio/I-9241-2019	Ribeiro Guevara, Sergio/0000-0001-7203-7687; Euillades, Pablo Andres/0000-0003-3168-1905; dos Santos Afonso, Maria/0000-0001-7851-9708; Agusto, Mariano/0000-0001-6037-8492													0305-8719		978-1-78620-244-4				2017	437						107	130		10.1144/SP437.16	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/SP437.16													WOS:000404905700008
J	HamiltonTaylor, J; Davison, W; Morfett, K				HamiltonTaylor, J; Davison, W; Morfett, K			The biogeochemical cycling of Zn, Cu, Fe, Mn, and dissolved organic C in a seasonally anoxic lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Detailed time-depth distributions of dissolved Zn, Cu, Fe, Mn, and dissolved organic C (DOC), together with pH, were obtained for the water column and near-surface sediment pore waters of a seasonally anoxic lake (Esthwaite Water, U.K.) over a l-yr period. Dissolved Fe and Mn followed well-known patterns linked to redox recycling. The variation in DOC resulted mostly from its coupling with Fe, DOC being coprecipitated with Fe oxide and released into solution on the reductive remobilization of the oxide. This process produced a >7-fold seasonal variation in DOC concentrations in the pore waters, with a maximum of similar to 7 mg liter(-1). Dissolved Zn and Cu exhibited coherent and similar distribution patterns unrelated in any simple way to the distributions of dissolved Fe and Mn, pH, and DOG. The most ubiquitous feature of the distribution of dissolved Zn, and to a lesser degree that of dissolved Cu, was a concentration maximum at the sediment-water interface, which disappeared completely only when anoxia was maximal in mid- and late summer. The interfacial maxima were attributed to rapid release from freshly deposited particles allied to sulfide precipitation in the sediments. The timing of events, associated with an increase in interfacial dissolved Cu and Zn concentrations before and during a period of ice cover, indicated that the Cu was derived from Fe and possibly Mn oxides and Zn from planktonic algae. The cumulative downward diffusive fluxes of Zn and Cu from the interfacial maxima were unimportant (similar to 1% of total) compared to total metal sedimentation rates. Chemical equilibrium calculations indicated that Zn- and Cu-sulfide complexes dominated in the pore waters under reducing conditions, with humic binding being insignificant, and that precipitation as pure sulfides or coprecipitation with FeS were likely major removal processes for Zn and Cu under anoxic conditions.

Many taxa common in freshwater lakes were either rare or absent at higher salinities. Lakes having salinities greater than about 10.0 g . L(-1) were distinguished by the overwhelming relative abundance of Cricotopus/Orthocladius. In less saline waters, common taxa included Chironomus, Procladius, Psectrocladius, and the subtribe Tanytarsina. Heterotrissocladius, Lauterborniella/Zavreliella, Pagastiella, and Sergentia were: only collected in freshwater habitats. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that three environmental variables (late summer lakewater salinity and concentrations of Sr and total P) explained significant variation in the weighted averages of taxa. Tanytarsina and Dicrotendipes were common at low Sr concentrations in carbonate lakes. A weighted-averaging calibration function was developed to infer salinity on the basis of fossil fauna. This model will allow palaeolimnologists to detect transitions between freshwater and moderately saline states and can be used to assist palaeoclimatic reconstructions for athalassic lake sites.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; 													0706-652X					MAY	1995	52	5					950	960		10.1139/f95-094	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f95-094													WOS:A1995RX74900007

Matahra Sugar Estate and Lake Basaka (highly saline, alkaline and sodic lake) are situated within the flat plains of Matahara region. The area is vulnerable to the occurrences of various tectonic and volcanic activities due to its location in the upper most part of the Main Ethiopian Rift Valley region. Study focus: In this study, the hydrochemical properties of different surface water and groundwater bodies available at Matahara region have been characterized for quality compositions. Water samples were collected from different water sources and analyzed for important major quality parameters following standard test procedures. Other chemical indices were derived from the measured quality parameters. The potential sources of minerals were suggested for each of the considered water sources based on their quality characteristics. New hydrological insights for the region: Overall, the study result elucidates that the chemical composition of different water bodies are due to natural processes and/or anthropogenic activities within the region. The local anthropogenic processes could be discharges from factory, domestic sewage and farming activities. Some of the water types are found to have relatively higher concentration of dissolved constituents. Irrigation waters have almost equal chemical compositions, indicating their hydro chemical sources are almost the same. Most of the concentrations are relatively high in Lake Basaka, groundwater and hot springs. It is easy to imagine the potential damaging effects of such quality waters on crop production, soil properties and environment of the region. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The total roach catch of the mass removal carried out with trawls was 507 metric tons (195 kg ha-1, 54% of the total catch). According to the virtual population analysis the biomass of the stock has decreased from 180 kg ha-1 in 1989 to c. 50 kg ha-1 in 1993. The production of the stock has fallen from 64 to 33 kg ha-1. The stock is dominated by younger age groups than before the mass removal. The future development of the stock is predicted by considering different levels of natural and fishing mortality. If the exploitation is stopped totally after 1993, roach biomass is predicted to double in 3 years. A constant fishing mortality rate of 0.3 (yearly catches 45-50 metric tons) would prevent the recovery of the stock, providing that 1-year-old and older roaches are exploited.																				1095-8649				NOV	1994	45	5					777	786		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1994.tb00943.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1994.tb00943.x													WOS:A1994PR49400006

This study evaluated the physical and chemical characteristics of groundwater, surface water, and snow in two lakes on the Barton Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica, with a particular focus on groundwater. Influxes/outfluxes of groundwater were measured using seepage meters, and hydraulic conductivities were calculated based on grain size analysis for the sediments. A total of 41 water samples were used to determine the chemical compositions and isotopic ratios of oxygen and hydrogen. The groundwater fluxes measured in one lake (referred to as "Lake A") were -9.9 x 10(-10) similar to 2.7 x 10(-9) m/s (average of -9.1 x 10(-10) similar to 3.6 x 10(-9) m/s) and in a second lake (referred to as "Lake B") were 2.2 x 10(-9) similar to 3.0 x 10(-9) m/s (average of 2.6 x 10(-9) +/- 4.0 x 10(-10) m/s). This indicates that groundwater flux is highly dynamic in Lake A, whereas groundwater influx in Lake B is relatively stable. Hydraulic conductivity for the lake sediments ranged between 1.7 x 10(-6) m/s and 2.1 x 10(-4) m/s. Oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions followed the global meteoric water line (GMWL) and local meteoric water line (LMWL), indicating that groundwater and surface water in the study area originate from the atmosphere. Evaporation may not be an influential factor probably due to the relatively humid climate during the summer season in the study area. Groundwater and surface water might partially experience isotopic exchange fractionation during and after the snow melting process. The chemical composition of groundwater was distinguished from that of surface water and snow by higher concentrations of major anions (Cl, SO4, and alkalinity), major cations (Ca, Mg, K, and Na), and trace elements (Si, Li, Sr, Mn, Zn, and Cu), resulting from water-rock interactions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to directly measure groundwater fluxes in lake systems in Antarctica, and to evaluate the characteristics of groundwater in the Barton Peninsula. It may therefore serve as a basis for studying the role of groundwater in the water cycle of Antarctica.					; Lim, Hyoun/AAC-5499-2022; Lee, Jeonghoon/E-8116-2010	Kim, Ok-Sun/0000-0003-1217-4780; Lim, Hyoun Soo/0000-0002-2489-4470; Jeen, Sung-Wook/0000-0003-4686-9046; Lee, Hyoungseok/0000-0002-5831-6345													0022-1694	1879-2707				NOV	2020	590								125537	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125537	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125537													WOS:000599754500234

The population density, diversity and productivity of the microbial plankton in an oligotrophic maritime Antarctic lake were studied for a 15-month period between December 1994 and February 1996. 2. In the lake, concentrations of nutrients and dissolved organic carbon were uniformly low, temperature varied over a small annual range of 0.1-3 degrees C, and the surface was ice-covered except during a period of approximately 6 weeks in summer. 3. The total of 57 morphotypes of protozoa observed during the study is a higher taxonomic diversity than previously reported from continental Antarctic lakes, but lower than that found in more eutrophic maritime Antarctic lakes. Likewise, planktonic abundance and productivity were lower than has been reported in other lakes on Signy Island, but generally higher than those of lakes on the Antarctic continent. 4. There were marked seasonal and interannual variations in planktonic population density. 5. Chlorophyll a concentrations ranged from undetectable to 4.2 mu g L-1 and the greatest rate of primary productivity measured was 4.5 mg C m(-3) h(-1). The phytoplankton was dominated by small chlorophytes and chrysophytes, with phototrophic nanoflagellate abundance ranging from 1.1 x 10(3) to 1.2 x 10(7) L-1. 6. Bacterial densities of 3.6 x 10(8) to 1.9 x 10(10) L-1 were recorded and bacterial productivity reached a peak of 0.36 mu g C L-1 h(-1). Numbers of heterotrophic nanoflagellates between 5.0 x 10(4) and 1.8 x 10(7) L-1, and of ciliates from undetectable to 1.1 x 104 L-l were observed. Naked amoebae were usually rare, but occasionally reached peaks of up to 1.5 x 10(3) L-1.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				FEB	2000	43	2					215	230		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00542.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00542.x													WOS:000085242200005

While this may enable persistence in variable environments, it may also produce novel competitive interactions in recipient habitats that contain conspecifics from other populations. Here we used genetics techniques to study the stock-specific movement and performance of juvenile sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) between July and August of 2008 in an ecosystem characterized by extensive juvenile migration and environmental change: the Chignik Lake system, Alaska. Genetic composition of juvenile sockeye salmon in the lower nursery lake based on 45 single nucleotide polymorphism markers indicated that 2008 was characterized by earlier timing and larger magnitude of emigrations from the upper lake, where rearing conditions have become increasingly unstable in recent decades. However, the larger size of emigrants did not confer a clear advantage in foraging based on comparisons of growth and body condition with juveniles native to the lower lake. These results highlight how shifting environmental conditions may exert pressures on evolved behavior patterns and increase interactions between sympatric populations, a theme of increasing importance where ecological uncertainty is high.

Rainbow smelt spawning population and habitat characteristics in a Missouri River reservoir	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Rainbow Smelt Osmerus mordax are the primary coldwater forage species in Lake Oahe, South Dakota, yet most aspects of their life history remain unknown. As Missouri River reservoirs present a novel habitat compared to elsewhere in the Rainbow Smelt's range, we investigated their spawning site use relative to available physical and thermal habitat from spring 2016 - 2018 using a mobile horizontal-beaming hydroacoustic survey. We mapped spawning habitat using side-scanning sonar to establish relationships with site bathymetry and thermal spawning conditions. From our site mapping, we determined the depth, slope, bottom hardness, and ruggedness of individual sites. We used a PCA to condense our physical habitat metrics, with PC1 representing 77% of cumulative variance. Peak abundance was linked to a physical habitat gradient, representing [steep slope, deep, soft bottom] to [low slope, shallow, hard bottom]. Peak Rainbow Smelt spawning aggregations were observed at 6.8 +/- 1.7 degrees C (Mean +/- StDev). An information-theoretic regression analysis revealed an interactive effect of temperature and habitat, whereby shallower, warmer sites typically had a lower peak abundance. These results represent the first step toward understanding habitat use characteristics of spawning Rainbow Smelt in reservoir systems.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				JAN 1	2021	36	1					235	251		10.1080/02705060.2021.1967209	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2021.1967209													WOS:000686795300001

Isolation and characterization of Lake Erie bacteria that degrade the cyanobacterial microcystin toxin MC-LR	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) is a cyclic hepatotoxin produced by cyanobacteria, including Microcystis sp. and Planktothrix sp. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) in Lake Erie have become a major human health concern in recent years, highlighted by the August 2014 City of Toledo, Ohio, municipal water "do not drink" order that affected nearly 500,000 residents for 3 days. Given that microcystin degrading bacteria have been reported from HAB-affected waters around the world, we hypothesized that MC-LR degrading bacteria could be isolated from Lake Erie. To test this hypothesis, 13 water samples were collected from various Lake Erie locations during the summers of 2014 and 2015, MC-LR was continuously added to each water sample for 3 to 5 weeks to enrich for MC-LR-degrading bacteria, and MC-LR was quantitated over time. Whereas MC-LR was relatively stable in sterile-filtered lake water, robust MC-LR degradation (up to 19 ppb/day) was observed in some water samples. Following the MC-LR selection process, 67 individual bacterial isolates were isolated from MC-LR degrading water samples and genotyped to exclude potential human pathogens, and MC-LR degradation by smaller groups of bacterial isolates (e.g., groups of 22 isolates, groups of 11 isolates, etc.) was examined. Of those smaller groups, selected groups of four to five bacterial isolates were found to degrade MC-LR into non-toxic forms and form robust biofilms on siliconized glass tubes. Taken together, these studies support the potential use of isolated bacterial isolates to remove MC-LR from drinking water. (C) 2018 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

One approach was based on linear regression between modem delta D values and climate parameters, and the other on a deterministic isotope model, modified from Craig and Gordon's terminal lake evaporation model that assumes steady-state conditions and constant isotope effects. One such effect, the net biochemical fractionation factor, was determined for a new species, pinon pine. Regressions showed that delta D values in cellulose nitrate from annual cohorts of needles (1989-1996) were strongly correlated with growing season (May-August) precipitation amount, and delta(13)C values in the same samples were correlated with June relative humidity. The deterministic model reconstructed delta D values of meteoric water used by plants after constraining relative humidity effects with delta(13)C values; growing season temperatures were estimated via modem correlations with delta D values of meteoric water. Variations of this modeling approach have been applied to tree-ring cellulose before, but not to macrofossil cellulose, and comparisons to empirical relationships have not been provided. Results from fossil pinon needles spanning the last similar to 40,000 years showed no significant trend in delta D values of cellulose nitrate, suggesting either no change in the amount of summer precipitation (based on the transfer function) or delta D values of meteoric water or temperature (based on the deterministic model). However, there were significant differences in delta(13)C values, and therefore relative humidity, between Pleistocene and Holocene.

Understanding the movements of this species may inform monitoring of outbreak risks for HPAI viruses; thus, we investigated the movement patterns of 29 Bar-headed Geese at Qinghai Lake, China during 2007 and 2008 by using high resolution GPS satellite telemetry. We described the movements and distribution of marked Bar-headed Geese during the pre-nesting, nesting, and moulting periods. Of 21 Bar-headed Geese with complete transmission records, 3 moved to other areas during the nesting period: 2 to Jianghe wetland (50 km northwest of Qinghai Lake) and 1 to Cuolongka Lake (220 km northwest of Qinghai Lake) during the nesting period. We identified nesting attempts of 7 of the marked geese at Qinghai Lake. Four completed successful nesting attempts according to our rules of judgment for the breeding status, and 2 geese lost broods soon after hatching (hereafter referred to as unsuccessful breeders). Of 18 geese present at Qinghai Lake during the nesting period, 9 (6 non-breeders, 2 successful breeders and 1 unsuccessful breeder) remained at Qinghai Lake during the moulting period; and 9 (5 non-breeders, 4 unsuccessful breeders) left Qinghai Lake for moulting. Kuhai Lake, Donggeicuona Lake, Alake Lake, Zhaling-Eling Lake area and Huangheyuan wetland area were used as moulting sites. Geese that moulted at Qinghai Lake, Cuolongka Lake, Kuhai Lake, Donggeicuona Lake and Alake Lake also moved to Zhaling-Eling Lake area or Huangheyuan wetland area and stayed there for several days prior to autumn migration.

Declination and inclination of the stable remanent magnetization present recurrent deviations from the mean geomagnetic field direction. The normalized intensity documents a series of relative paleointensity (RPI) lows recognized in other reference records. Three directional anomalies occurring during RPI lows chronologically correspond to the Laschamp excursion (42 kyr BP), the Blake event (115-122 kyr BP) and the Icelandic basin excursion (190 kyr BP). A fourth directional anomaly recorded at 290 kyr BP during another RPI low defines the 'Portuguese margin excursion'. Four non-excursional RPI lows are recorded at the ages of the Jamaica/Pringle Falls, Mamaku, Calabrian Ridge 1, and Levantine excursions. The RPI record is characterized by a periodicity of similar to 100 kyr, paleointensity lows often coinciding with the end of interglacial stages. This record sets the basis of the construction of an authigenic Be-10/Be-9 record from the same sedimentary sequences [Carcaillet et al., this issue]. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

J	Kynard, B; Parker, E; Kynard, B				Kynard, Boyd; Parker, Erika; Kynard, Brian			Ontogenetic behavior of Kootenai River White Sturgeon, Acipenser transmontanus, with a note on body color: A laboratory study	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Laboratory studies indicated the following ontogenetic behavior and body color of wild Kootenai River White Sturgeon, Acipenser transmontanus, (hereafter, Kootenai Sturgeon), a landlocked population in the Kootenai River, a major tributary of the Columbia River (United States) and Kootenay Lake (Canada). Hatchling free embryos (hereafter, embryos) are photonegative and hide under cover at a spawning site, and have a grey body. Late-embryos are photopositive and weakly prefer white substrate, use cover less with age, and develop a black tail. Day 13 larvae forage in the day on the open bottom, use cover less with age, prefer bright habitat, have a light-grey body and black tail, and initiate a mostly nocturnal dispersal for about 21 days, and then, continue a weaker dispersal. As they age, the entire body and tail of larvae is a dark-grey color when they develop into juveniles (about 66 days). The common body and tail color of larvae from the Kootenai, Columbia, and Sacramento rivers indicate a common adaptation to signal conspecifics or avoid predators. Juveniles are variable for foraging height, do not hide in bottom cover, and continue a weak nocturnal downstream movement. Movement of larvae and juveniles in the artificial stream suggests wild Kootenai Sturgeon have a long slow dispersal style (disperse for months). The long dispersal style of young Kootenai Sturgeon may adapt larvae to dispersing all summer in a 100-200 km long reach with a low abundance of food. The final destination of Kootenai Sturgeon during their first rearing season is unknown, but the long dispersal suggests fish could easily move to the lower river or to Kootenay Lake. Ontogenetic behavior of Kootenai Sturgeon is slightly different from Columbia River White Sturgeon, which has a weak embryo dispersal, but both populations have a similar major dispersal by larvae. However, both of these populations differ qualitatively from Sacramento River White Sturgeon, in which juveniles initiate the major dispersal. Thus, major geographic behavioral variation exists among populations and should be considered in restoration programs.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				MAY	2010	88	1					65	77		10.1007/s10641-010-9618-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-010-9618-9													WOS:000276129900010

Glacier change in western North America: influences on hydrology, geomorphic hazards and water quality	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The glaciers of western Canada and the conterminous United States have dominantly retreated since the end of the Little Ice Age (LIA) in the nineteenth century, although average rates of retreat varied from strong in the first-half of the twentieth century, with glaciers stabilizing or even advancing until 1980, and then resuming consistent recession. This retreat has been accompanied by statistically detectable declines in late-summer streamflow from glacier-fed catchments over much of the Study area, although there is some geographical variation: over recent decades, glaciers in northwest BC and southwest Yukon have lost mass dominantly by thinning with relatively low rates of terminal retreat, and glacier-fed streams in that region have experienced increasing flows. In many valleys, glacier retreat has produced geomorphic hazards, including outburst floods from moraine-dammed lakes, mass failures from oversteepened valley walls and debris flows generated on moraines. In addition to these hydrologic and geomorphic changes, evidence is presented that glacier retreat will result in higher stream temperatures, possibly transient increases in suspended sediment fluxes and concentrations, and changes in water chemistry. With climate projected to continue warming over the twenty-first century, current trends in hydrology, geomorphology and water quality should continue, with a range of implications for water resources availability and management and hydroecology, particularly for cool and cold-water species such as salmonids.

Correlation with other climate proxies from different regions implies that hydrological conditions in Northwest China were governed by Asian summer monsoon precipitation during the early and middle Holocene and that the increase in humidity over the last two millennia was controlled by westerly-derived precipitation. Regional evidence for early human activities in the lake sediments starts to accumulate from the onset of the driest interval comprising records of enhanced charred grass fragment concentrations (since ca. 4350 cal. yr BP), and pollen of Cerealia type (since ca. 4000 cal. yr BP), Xanthium (since ca. 3700 cal. yr BP), and Cannabis type (since ca. 2500 cal. yr BP). These signals are likely related to early agro-pastoral populations of regional Andronovo Culture that, according to archaeological data, appeared in the south-eastern Tian Shan around 4000 cal. yr BP. In addition, increased Xanthium pollen and charred grass fragment abundances point to enhanced human impact linked to intensified Silk Road activities during the Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE).					; Tarasov, Pavel/ABG-3993-2020; Hoelzmann, Philipp/H-7008-2019; Long, Tengwen/AAA-7299-2022	Long, Tengwen/0000-0002-8960-3179; Leipe, Christian/0000-0002-0805-2345; /0000-0002-7219-5009; Hoelzmann, Philipp/0000-0001-8709-8474; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				FEB 15	2019	516						166	178		10.1016/j.palaeo.2018.11.038	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2018.11.038													WOS:000456903000015
J	Tardif, J; Bergeron, Y				Tardif, J; Bergeron, Y			Comparative dendroclimatological analysis of two black ash and two white cedar populations from contrasting sites in the Lake Duparquet region, northwestern Quebec	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												The relationship between radial growth and climate was analyzed in two black ash (Fraxinus nigra Marsh.) and two white cedar populations (Thuja occidentalis L.) growing in contrasting sites in the Abitibi region of Quebec. An indexed mean chronology of radial growth was developed in each case. Black ash from flooded sites did not cross-date with those from unflooded sites and responded differently to climate. On the floodplain sites, black ash radial growth is directly correlated with the previous year's August precipitation (i - 1) and with the current year's June precipitation (i). High water levels at the beginning of the growing season also had a negative impact on the following year's growth, whereas a high drought index during June of the preceding year (i - 1) had a positive one. Radial growth of unflooded black ash is mainly related to temperature. For those black ash not exposed to flooding, the preceding year's August temperature (i - 1), as opposed to August precipitation, had a negative impact on the current year's growth. A high drought index in June (i) also had a negative impact on the current year's growth. Compared with black ash, white cedar from both xeric and mesic sites showed good between-site cross dating and had similar relationships to climate. In both cases, abundant summer precipitation, associated with cool temperature, produced maximum growth. Temperature during August of the preceding year (i - 1) was also negatively correlated with radial growth. White cedar from xeric sites also responded more intensely to drought, as revealed by the negative relationship to the June-July (i) drought index. In conclusion, growth-ring analyses show the specificity of the climatic response of these two species and the filtering effect caused by different environments.																			0045-5067	1208-6037				JAN	1997	27	1					108	116		10.1139/cjfr-27-1-108	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-27-1-108													WOS:A1997XD79000016

Five ostracod species inhabit the lake (Herpetocypris chevreuxi, Ilyocypris gibba, Limnocythere inopinata, Heterocypris exigua and and Plesiocypridopsis newtoni), the last two being outstandingly dominant (> 98 % of total ostracod abundance with maximum densities of 220,000 ind/m(2) and 67,000 ind/m(2), respectively). Populations of both species occur in the lake all the year around with a peak ill late spring. Their sex-ratios were frequently biased towards females and shallower habitats (similar to 15 cm deep) were strongly and positively selected against less shallow ones (similar to 30 cm deep). We also explored the functional role of these species in the lake through estimates of their annual secondary production (28.7 and 4 g DW m (2)yr (1) for H. exigua and P. newtoni, respectively) and we related these production results with existing data for whole system productivity to examine the importance of ostracods in energy flux.

The reconstruction explains 48% of the variation in the observed temperature from 1962 to 2003. Warm periods occurred during 1714-1732, 1753-1776, 1800-1840, 1866-1886, 1893-1911, and 1943-1969, while the periods of 1708-1713, 1733 -1752, 1777-1799, 1841-1865, 1887-1892, 1912-1942, and 1970-1993 were relatively cold. Power spectral and wavelet analyses demonstrated the existence of significant 50-, 14-, 2.8-, and 2.5-year cycles of variability. The results of a spatial correlation analysis suggested that this temperature reconstruction contains climatic signals for a large area of Central Asia. After employing a 21-year low-pass filter, the coherence of the newly reconstructed series with a regional temperature reconstruction for Central Asia and also with a local temperature reconstruction for the Zajsan Lake area of East Kazakhstan indicates that our temperature reconstruction captures broad-scale regional climatic variations in the low-frequency domain.

Relative Sensitivity Distribution of Freshwater Planktonic Crustaceans to Trace Metals	HUMAN AND ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT												Cladocerans and copepods are common inhabitants of ponds and lakes, but assessments of the toxic effects of chemicals on aquatic organisms are often based mainly on toxicity data for cladocerans of the genus Daphnia. The paucity of toxicity data for copepods and other species of cladocerans raised the question whether toxicity data derived primarily from daphniids can be extrapolated to protect other planktonic organisms. In this study, we address this question by systematically comparing between the sensitivities of cladocerans and copepods to the metals Cd, Cu, Pb, Ni, and Zn using the species sensitivity distributions. Our results indicate that cladocerans are consistently more sensitive than copepods to Cd and Cu. Most importantly, sensitivities of D. magna, D. pulex, and Ceriodaphnia dubia, the three most commonly tested cladocerans, to these metals are higher than those of most copepod species and fall within the range of those exhibited by other cladocerans. C. dubia, a cladoceran with relatively small body size, is more sensitive to all metals than most other cladoceran species. Our results imply that water quality criteria of trace metals derived from datasets dominated by Daphnia are likely also protective to copepods and most other cladocerans.					; Wong, Chris/JPX-1434-2023; Leung, Kenneth Mei Yee/C-1055-2009; Leung, Kenneth/C-1055-2009; Kwok, Kevin/NPJ-1491-2025	Kwok, Kevin Wing Hin/0000-0003-3264-134X; Leung, Kenneth Mei Yee/0000-0002-2164-4281; 													1080-7039	1549-7860					2009	15	6					1335	1345		10.1080/10807030903307115	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10807030903307115													WOS:000273022500015

JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Hypolimnetic oxygenation can improve water quality by decreasing hypolimnetic accumulation of reduced compounds that complicate potable water treatment. Historically, aeration systems have been undersized because designers have not accounted for increases in sediment oxygen demand (SOD) resulting from the operation of aeration systems. A comprehensive study was performed to estimate the hypolimnetic oxygen demand (HOD) in San Vicente Reservoir, a eutrophic raw water reservoir in San Diego. Chamber experiments confirmed that turbulence and oxygen concentration at the sediment-water interface dramatically affected SOD. Values ranged from under 0.2 g/m(2)/day under quiescent low-oxygen conditions to over 1.0 g/m(2)/day under turbulent high-oxygen conditions. Based on a statistical evaluation of historical oxygen concentrations in the reservoir and anticipated increases in SOD resulting from operation of an oxygenation system, a design HOD of 16,400 kg/day was estimated. This is approximately four times the HOD observed in the spring after the onset of thermal stratification. Laboratory chamber experiments confirmed that maintenance of a well-oxygenated sediment-water interface inhibited the release of phosphate, ammonia, iron, and manganese from sediments. In addition, hydrodynamic modeling using DYRESM-WQ showed that operation of a linear diffuser oxygenation system would not significantly affect thermal stratification.																			0733-9372	1943-7870				FEB	2007	133	2					130	138		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(2007)133:2(130)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(2007)133:2(130)													WOS:000243546900003
J	WARNER, K				WARNER, K			MORTALITY OF LANDLOCKED ATLANTIC SALMON HOOKED ON 4 TYPES OF FISHING GEAR AT THE HATCHERY	PROGRESSIVE FISH-CULTURIST												The mortality of age II hatchery-reared landlocked Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) hooked on 4 types of fishing gear was evaluated by conducting experiments at the Casco and Grand Lake (Maine, USA) Fish-cultural Stations, in spring 1976-78. An additional experiment to evaluate mortality of fish purposely deep-hooked on worms was conducted in 1978. Of 1221 fish caught on all gear types, only 5% died after hooking; less than 1% of the 300 control fish died. No significant differences (.chi.2, P < 0.05) were demonstrated in mortality among the 4 gear types (treble- and single-hook hardware lures, flies, earthworms). Of total mortalities, 89% died within 24 h. Of 106 salmon purposely allowed to swallow worm baits, 73% died. Of 56 fish in which the hook was left in place and the leader cut at the mouth, 57% died during the 14-day holding period. A significantly greater mortality (90%; .chi.2, P < 0.05) was experienced for 50 deeply hooked salmon from which hooks were removed. Reasons for possible underestimation in mortality for worm-hooking experiments in hatcheries are discussed.																			0033-0779						1979	41	2					99	102		10.1577/1548-8659(1979)41[99:MOLASH]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1979)41[99:MOLASH]2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1979GV99100019

Pelagic phytoplankton community change-points across nutrient gradients and in response to invasive mussels	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Phytoplankton communities can experience nonlinear responses to changing nutrient concentrations, but the nature of species shifts within phytoplankton is not well understood and few studies have explored responses of pelagic assemblages in large lakes. Using pelagic phytoplankton data from the Great Lakes, we assessed phytoplankton assemblage change-point responses to nutrients and invasive Dreissena, characterising community responses in a multi-stressor environment and determine whether species responses to insitu nutrients can be approximated from nutrient loading. We demonstrate assemblage shifts in phytoplankton communities along major stressor gradients, particularly prominent in spring assemblages, providing insight into community thresholds at the lower end of the phosphorus gradient and species-stressor responses in a multi-stressor environment. We show that responses to water nutrient concentrations could not be estimated from large-scale nutrient loading data likely due to lake-specific retention time and long-term accumulation of nutrients. These findings highlight the potential for significant accumulation of nitrates in ultra-oligotrophic systems, nonlinear responses of phytoplankton at nutrient concentrations relevant to current water quality standards and system-specific (e.g. lake or ecozone) differences in phytoplankton responses likely due to differences in nutrient co-limitation and effects of dreissenids.

Opportunistic predation of birds by breeding Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus)	PLOS ONE												Dietary specialization, exploiting a small fraction of available food resources, is commonly reported for gulls and skuas. Predation of birds by these species is usually considered a specialist strategy employed by the minority of the population but non-specialists also predate birds and may actually have a greater impact on the prey species. To date, most studies have focused on predatory bird-specialists, down-playing the possible importance of opportunistic predation by non-specialists. We addressed this by studying diet (regurgitated pellets and prey remains) and behavior of breeding Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) over three summers at Gull Island, a mixed-species breeding colony in Lake Ontario. One-third of all pellets analyzed contained bird remains, primarily the most numerous breeding bird: Ring-billed Gull (L.delawarensis) chicks (51%) and adults (36%). Although all but one pair of Herring Gulls ate birds, all pairs maintained broad and mostly similar diets, with birds accounting for at most one-third of prey. Behavior also indicated that Herring Gulls at Gull Island were not predatory bird-specialists because predation was too infrequent to meet energetic requirements, was largely unsuccessful and was only ever observed when Ring-billed Gulls strayed into Herring Gull breeding territories. Instead, bird predation appeared mainly opportunistic, increasing with seasonal availability, access to shoreline, proximity to nesting Ring-billed Gulls and breeding territory size. Compared with predatory specialist Herring Gulls in the same region, individuals that predated birds at Gull Island did not display specialist behaviors and killed six times fewer birds (0.1-0.4 per day, on average) but were over 20 times more numerous (98% of the population versus 4%). Thus, our results indicate that opportunistic predation by non-specialists may have important consequences for prey species. Since opportunistic predation cannot be effectively managed using techniques widely advocated for specialist predators, it is essential to investigate cause of predation by large gulls prior to lethal management.																				1932-6203				OCT 15	2020	15	10							e0239180	10.1371/journal.pone.0239180	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239180								33057336					WOS:000581814700079

The cells were Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, non-motile, straight rods and formed reddish colonies. Phylogenetic analysis based on its 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that strain HMF3095(T) fell within the cluster of the genus Hymenobacter and was most closely related to Hymenobacter seoulensis 16F7G(T) and Hymenobacter tenuis POB6(T) (96.7 % sequence similarity). Sequence similarities to all other type strains were 96.3 % or less. The major fatty acids were iso-C-15( : 0), C-16( : 1)omega 5c, summed feature 4 (iso-C-17( : 1) I and/or anteiso-C-17( : 1) B), summed feature 3 (C-16( : 1)omega 7c and/or C-16( : 1)omega 6c) and anteiso-C-15( : 0). The major isoprenoid quinone was menaquinone 7. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, three unidentified aminophospholipids and one unidentified phospholipid. The DNA G+C content was 58.9 mol%. On the basis of the evidence presented in this study, strain HMF3095(T) represents a novel species of the genus Hymenobacter, for which the name Hymenobacter aquatilis sp. nov. is proposed.

In this paper, and a companion paper by Coffey et al., we review technical literature addressing the responses of different water quality attributes to historical and potential future changes in air temperature and precipitation. The goal is to document how different attributes of water quality are sensitive to these drivers, to characterize future risk to inform management responses, and to identify research needs to fill gaps in our understanding. Here we focus on potential changes in streamflow, water temperature, and salt water intrusion (SWI). Projected changes in the volume and timing of streamflow vary regionally, with general increases in northern and eastern regions of the U.S., and decreases in the southern Plains, interior Southwest, and parts of the Southeast. Water temperatures have increased throughout the U.S. and are expected to continue to increase in the future, with the greatest changes in locations where high summer air temperatures occur together with low streamflow volumes. In coastal areas, especially the mid-Atlantic and Gulf coasts, SWI to rivers and aquifers could be exacerbated by sea level rise, storm surges, and altered freshwater runoff. Management responses for reducing risks to water quality should consider strategies and practices robust to a range of potential future conditions.					; Coffey, Rory/G-4542-2014	Johnson, Thomas E./0000-0003-4073-938X; Coffey, Rory/0000-0001-5941-0205													1093-474X	1752-1688				AUG	2019	55	4					824	843		10.1111/1752-1688.12710	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12710								34316251					WOS:000477979100005
J	Moller, CL; Sand-Jensen, K				Moller, Claus Lindskov; Sand-Jensen, Kaj			High sensitivity of Lobelia dortmanna to sediment oxygen depletion following organic enrichment	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												P>Lobelia dortmanna thrives in oligotrophic, softwater lakes thanks to O(2) and CO(2) exchange across roots and uptake of sediment nutrients. We hypothesize that low gas permeability of leaves constrains Lobelia to pristine habitats because plants go anoxic in the dark if O(2) vanishes from sediments. We added organic matter to sediments and followed O(2) dynamics in plants and sediments using microelectrodes. To investigate plant stress, nutrient content and photosynthetic capacity of leaves were measured. Small additions of organic matter triggered O(2) depletion and accumulation of NH(4)+, Fe2+ and CO(2) in sediments. O(2) in leaf lacunae fluctuated from above air saturation in the light to anoxia late in the dark in natural sediments, but organic enrichment prolonged anoxia because of higher O(2) consumption and restricted uptake from the water. Leaf N and P dropped below minimum thresholds for cell function in enriched sediments and was accompanied by critically low chlorophyll and photosynthesis. We propose that anoxic stress restricts ATP formation and constrains transfer of nutrients to leaves. Brief anoxia in sediments and leaf lacunae late at night is a recurring summer phenomenon in Lobelia populations, but increased input of organic matter prolongs anoxia and reduces survival.

J	Anderson, L; Mast, A; Brice, B; Berkelhammer, M				Anderson, Lesleigh; Mast, Alisa; Brice, Becky; Berkelhammer, Max			Testing tree-ring cellulose δ18O with water isotopes for Holocene lake δ18O interpretations in the central Rocky Mountains USA	HOLOCENE												Stable isotopes of water preserved in geologic archives, primarily as oxygen (delta 18O), have proven critical for documenting Earth's climatic and hydrologic systems past and present. However, timescale differences of water isotope inputs to proxy systems and the signal embedded in long paleorecords often confound translation to observed hydroclimatic metrics. Here, a unique 20-year dataset of meteorology, hydrology, and the isotopic composition of weekly meteoric and surface water samples (delta 18O, delta 2H) are combined with paleoclimate delta 18O data from tree-ring cellulose and lake carbonate to better understand proxy signals of Upper Colorado river basin drought. Annual tree-ring cellulose delta 18O from Picea engelmannii growing within a glacier-fed creek and a spring discharge area were used to derive annual source water delta 18O using a cellulose source-water isotope model. Comparisons with the monitoring record indicates that tree-ring cellulose delta 18O tracks variations in wet and dry hydroclimatic extremes. Source water isotopes are shown to reflect the hydroclimate of the current year and some number of previous years as an effective moisture-discharge proxy rather than a precipitation isotope proxy.

Experimental mixing of a north-temperate lake: testing the thermal limits of a cold-water invasive fish	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Species' thermal limits play a key role in determining spatial distributions and understanding their response to changing environments. Manipulation of thermal habitat is a potential avenue of exploration for management of invasive species such as the cold-water rainbow smelt(Osmerus mordax), which has adverse effects on native fish communities in central North American inland lakes. In an effort to test the thermal limits and selectively eradicate rainbow smelt, we experimentally mixed Crystal Lake, Wisconsin, USA, during summer of 2012 and 2013 to warm the hypolimnion and eliminate cold-water habitat. This whole-ecosystem manipulation allowed for field testing of published thermal thresholds reported for rainbow smelt. The rainbow smelt population responded to the thermal manipulation by exhibiting unexpected shifts in behavior, intrapopulation divergence in body condition, and significant population declines. Small individuals of each adult age-class tended to survive the manipulation, and the population persisted despite high mortality rates. Our results indicate a high degree of size-based intrapopulation variation in thermal sensitivity for this species. Our findings also raise questions regarding applicability of lab-and model-derived thermal limits to field scenarios, highlighting a need for further field evaluations of species' thermal limits.

Many challenges were faced in trying to determine the amount of oil in a barge that had sunk 50 years before and was lying upside down and nearly completely buried in 70 feet of water. The salvage contractor and die U.S. Coast Guard overcame many technical problems in developing an effective and low-risk method of oil removal. The solution included the use of a hot-tap drill and phased pumping system to maximize the amount of oil recovered. The underwater operation required many divers and a total force of 55 personnel working together for the 33-day duration. This was the largest operation of its kind in the Great Lakes and offers valuable lessons to others who may encounter similar situations.																									1997							783	788																WOS:000073241400122

The objective of this study was to quantify the escapement rate of silver eels to obtain an estimate of the future spawners migrating from the southern part of its distribution area in Tunisia. A mark-recapture experiment was conducted in Ichkeul Lake (Tunisia) between December 2013 and February 2014, covering the winter downstream run of eels. The size range of the downstream migrating eels was between 33 and 79 cm with 585.3 +/- 156.77 g mean weight. The number of migrating silver eels was estimated to 342 221 (297 956-386 486), corresponding to a biomass of 200.2 (174.3-226.1) t, with a density of 23.55 (20.51-26.6) kg ha(-1). The commercial fishing rate was estimated to be 18.8% (16.6-21.5%), which translates into an escapement rate of 81.2% (78.5-83.4%). The ratio current/pristine escapement was 0.69 for the entire migration period.																			1054-3139	1095-9289				JAN	2016	73	1					142	149		10.1093/icesjms/fsv185	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsv185													WOS:000371140700015

The Influence of Changes in Lifestyle and Mercury Exposure in Riverine Populations of the Madeira River (Amazon Basin) near a Hydroelectric Project	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												In the Amazon Basin, naturally occurring methylmercury bioaccumulates in fish, which is a key source of protein consumed by riverine populations. The hydroelectric power-plant project at Santo Antonio Falls allows us to compare the Hg exposure of riverine populations sparsely distributed on both sides of the Madeira river before the area is to be flooded. From 2009 to 2011, we concluded a population survey of the area (N = 2,008; representing circa 80% of community residents) that estimated fish consumption and mercury exposure of riverine populations with different degrees of lifestyle related to fish consumption. Fish samples from the Madeira river (N = 1,615) and 110 species were analyzed for Hg. Hair-Hg was significantly lower (p < 0.001) in less isolated communities near to the capital of Porto Velho (median 2.32 ppm) than in subsistence communities in the Cunia Lake, 180 km from Porto Velho city (median 6.3 ppm). Fish Hg concentrations ranged from 0.01 to 6.06 mu g/g, depending on fish size and feeding behavior. Currently available fish in the Madeira river show a wide variability in Hg concentrations. Despite cultural similarities, riparians showed hair-Hg distribution patterns that reflect changes in fish-eating habits driven by subsistence characteristics.

Submerged aquatic vegetation in Cook's Bay, Lake Simcoe: Assessment of changes in response to increased water transparency	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A high frequency echo sounding method was employed to assess the extent of SAV cover and depth of colonization in Cook's Bay, Lake Simcoe during the late summer of 2006 and 2007. Results from this study are compared to historical echo sounding surveys in Cook's Bay conducted in 1984 and 1987, prior to reductions in point source phosphorus loads to the lake and before dreissenid mussel invasion. This study revealed that the total area of inner Cook's Bay covered by SAV has increased 65% since 1987, and SAV coverage extends to depths approaching 10 m. The areal expansion of SAV and increased depth of colonization are consistent with observations of increasing water transparency documented by the Ontario Ministry of Environment since the 1980s. Tissue nutrient content (N and P) of SAV growing in Cook's Bay during 2006 was found to be significantly lower than nutrient content measured in 1984 suggesting that light availability has increased relative to nutrient availability to SAV. The results of this study support are consistent with other studies demonstrating an areal expansion and increased depth of SAV colonization in response to increased water transparency.

Colorimetric Determination of Lead Using Gold Nanoparticles	ANALYTICAL LETTERS												A combined homogeneous assay and colorimetric determination method using gold nanoparticles was developed for rapid determination of lead(II) in contaminated natural waters. The presence of lead(II) in the colloidal gold suspension causes a change in the absorbance of the suspension. An increase in the absorption property at 595nm is accompanied by a change in the size of the gold nanoparticles. High concentrations of lead cause aggregation of the gold colloids. Colloidal gold nanoparticles were synthesized using tannic acid as the reducing agent; this reagent allowed selective determination of lead in 10 mu L of water, with a detection limit of 310ngmL(-1) with an analysis time of 5min. The coefficient of variation for lead(II) within the working range of the assay (520ngmL(-1)-13 mu gmL(-1)) varied from 1.3% to 9.2%. The limit of detection using this method with a sample volume of 50 mu L was 60ngmL(-1). The coefficient of variation for lead over the working range of the determined concentrations (80ngmL(-1)-25 mu gmL(-1)) varied from 0.2% to 9.3%, while the values for the inter-day assay (n=8) were less than 10%. The method was employed for the analysis of river, lake, marsh, and spring water; the recovery of lead was determined to be 72.5%-130% for 10 mu L of water and 93.6%-114.7% for 50 mu L.

J	HECKY, RE; MCCULLOUGH, GK				HECKY, RE; MCCULLOUGH, GK			EFFECT OF IMPOUNDMENT AND DIVERSION ON THE SEDIMENT BUDGET AND NEARSHORE SEDIMENTATION OF SOUTHERN INDIAN LAKE	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Shoreline erosion added an annual average of 4 .times. 106 [tonne] of mineral sediment per year to Southern Indian Lake (postimpoundment area, 2391 km2) during the first 3 yr of impoundment. This erosion increased sedimentary input to the lake by a factor of 20. The lake retained 90% of this eroded material within its basin, and 80-90% of the retained material was deposited nearshore. Despite the production of extremely fine constituent particle sizes, eroding shorelines generated predominantly large clay aggregates, initially transported offshore as bed load. During bed load transport, abrasion of clay aggregates produced fine particles that became suspended. Over 80% of the suspended load is lost to outflows from the lake because the suspended load is primarily fine silt and clay-sized particles, most of which do not settle even under winter ice cover. The extensive nearshore clay aggregate deposits are temporary, and net deposition in these areas will change to net erosion when input of sediment from eroding shorelines ceases. The effects of shoreline erosion on the lake''s sediment regime will persist for decades.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1984	41	4					567	578		10.1139/f84-070	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f84-070													WOS:A1984SU52800003

On Anticosti Island, Quebec, Canada, introduced white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmermann, 1780)) have caused massive changes to the native boreal forest. Despite the apparent stability of the deer population over recent decades, we suspected that they were not at equilibrium with their browse supply and that further degradation of the habitat had occurred. A comparison of two browse surveys conducted 25 years apart showed a strong decline in browse availability. Although balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) P. Mill.) remained the most available browse species, it declined or disappeared from most stands (n = 13). Preferred deciduous species that were still available 25 years ago have almost disappeared. The continuous decline of the browse supply confirmed our hypothesis. This situation may be exacerbated by a subsidy from the winter litterfall, a significant and stable alternative food source. The abundance of litterfall from mature trees is independent of browsing over a long time period, which introduces a temporal uncoupling between the impact of deer browsing on balsam fir seedlings and the negative feedback from recruitment failure of mature balsam fir on the deer population. This means that the system is susceptible to being forced into an alternative regime.

As engineer species, they structure these ecosystems and increase biodiversity. Many studies have focused on submerged macrophytes, but research on habitats created by rooted floating-leaf macrophytes is scarcer. Macrophytes such as water lilies should have the similar ecological consequences as submerged macrophytes do, but with a greater shading effect. In this study, we show how macrophytes structure phytoplankton assemblages and allow different assemblages to coexist in the same shallow lake. During the summer of 2018, we characterized the phytoplankton assemblages in 9 stations covered by water lilies and 6 stations in open water, all in a large shallow lake. The lake was colonized on a third of its surface by water lilies from April to October. We showed an effect of waterlilies on temperature, oxygen, pH, turbidity, phosphates, and dissolved silicon. Many phytoplankton taxa from almost all classes were in higher abundance in the stations covered by macrophytes, while cyanobacteria showed a higher biomass and richness in open water. Unicellular mixotrophic flagellates predominated in the macrophyte habitats, where all representatives of the classes Euglenophyceae and Cryptophyceae were present.

In the context of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) targets on health (Goal 3), water quality (Goal 6), life under water (Goal 14), and clean water and sanitation (Goal 6), which aim to "ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all", we investigated the environmental reservoirs of V. cholerae in Vembanad Lake, the largest lake in Kerala (India), where cholera is endemic. The response of environmental reservoirs of V. cholerae to variability in essential climate variables may play a pivotal role in determining the quality of natural water resources, and whether they might be safe for human consumption or not. The hydrodynamics of Vembanad Lake, and the man-made barrier that divides the lake, resulted in spatial and temporal variability in salinity (1-32 psu) and temperature (23 to 36 degrees C). The higher ends of this salinity and temperature ranges fall outside the preferred growth conditions for V. cholerae reported in the literature. The bacteria were associated with filtered water as well as with phyto- and zooplankton in the lake. Their association with benthic organisms and sediments was poor to nil. The prevalence of high laminarinase and chitinase enzyme expression (more than 50 mu gmL(-1) min(-1)) among V. cholerae could underlie their high association with phyto- and zooplankton. Furthermore, the diversity in the phytoplankton community in the lake, with dominance of genera such as Skeletonema sp., Microcystis sp., Aulacoseira sp., and Anabaena sp., which changed with location and season, and associated changes in the zooplankton community, could also have affected the dynamics of the bacteria in the lake. The probability of presence or absence of V. cholerae could be expressed as a function of chlorophyll concentration in the water, which suggests that risk maps for the entire lake can be generated using satellite-derived chlorophyll data. In situ observations and satellite-based extrapolations suggest that the risks from environmental V. cholerae in the lake can be quite high (with probability in the range of 0.5 to 1) everywhere in the lake, but higher values are encountered more frequently in the southern part of the lake. Remote sensing has an important role to play in meeting SDG goals related to health, water quality and life under water, as demonstrated in this example related to cholera.

Assessment of Carbon Dioxide Piscicide Treatments	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Few chemicals are approved to control or eradicate nuisance fish populations in the United States. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is currently being developed and studied as a new piscicide option for nonselective population control. This study evaluated dry ice (solid state CO2) as a simple CO2 delivery method during winter piscicide applications. Nonnative Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, Bighead Carp H. nobilis, and native Fathead Minnow Pimephales promelas were overwintered together in ice-covered ponds treated with 25kg dry ice/100,000L (low treatment) or 50kg dry ice/100,000L (high treatment). Overwinter fish survival was significantly reduced in ponds treated with dry ice relative to untreated control ponds. Fathead Minnows were less susceptible to CO2 exposure than the carps, with 26-96% survival in low-treatment ponds and 4-68% survival in high-treatment ponds. Silver Carp and Bighead Carp were more sensitive to CO2 treatments and no individuals of either species survived in ponds with the high-treatment level. Water samples were also collected in all ponds throughout this study, and we observed notably higher Silver Carp and Bighead Carp environmental DNA (eDNA) concentrations in dry-ice-treated ponds relative to untreated control ponds. Distinct changes in eDNA trends correlated with fish mortality, and results indicate that eDNA sampling could be a useful indicator of piscicide efficacy. This study demonstrates that CO2 administered as dry ice is an effective under-ice piscicide method.					; Erickson, Richard/AAU-4957-2020	Rivera, Jose/0000-0003-3756-6860; Kageyama, Stacie/0000-0003-4185-3627; Erickson, Richard/0000-0003-4649-482X; Cupp, Aaron/0000-0001-5995-2100													0275-5947	1548-8675				DEC	2018	38	6					1241	1250		10.1002/nafm.10227	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10227													WOS:000455589100003

The effect of various additives to the domestic water supply on the growth of Mytilus was investigated. Cl and F- had no effect although F- (as NaF) inhibited feces production in a 7-day experiment. Determinations of the Cu level in the laboratory''s tap water showed these to be high enough to cause depression of growth even at low dilution levels. When distilled water or lake water was used to dilute the sea water, shell growth was not affected until a sinusoidal fluctuation reaching a minimum of 50% sea water was used. Such effect did not become significant until the mussels were kept in pure fresh water for an extended period in each cycle of sinusoidal salinity variations.

Three high-resolution current profilers measured turbulent dissipation rates. Three dense temperature logger arrays measured stratification. A turbulent surface mixed layer grew thicker with nightly cooling and thinner with daily warming. However, both day and night, turbulence was inhibited in a stratified layer that separated the surface mixed layer from the deeper pond. Nightly cooling, likely intensified in shallow regions of the pond, generated 10-cm-thick cold layers, which flowed down the sloping bed to renew bottom waters. A heat balance suggests sufficient flow to replace most bottom water each night. Groundwater flows were too slow to influence this circulation, but likely advected significant heat into sediments near the pond's western end. Bottom water renewal may influence greenhouse gas emissions and heat transport in the evolving permafrost landscape.

In this investigation, the horizontal thermal advection caused by thermal inhomogeneity over the alpine wetland is calculated based on the eddy covariance data observed at the Flower Lake observation field and WRF modelling data over the Zoige alpine wetland, China. The contribution of horizontal thermal advection to the near-surface energy closure is analysed. The results show that the mean horizontal heat advection of the Zoige wetland is 20.2 W center dot m(-2), and the maximum value reached 55.0 W center dot m(-2) in the summer of 2017. After introducing thermal advection into the near-surface energy balance equation, the near-surface energy closure ratio increased from 72.3% to 81.0%.

The objective of this study was to clarify which processes are important in the water exchange and must be taken into account in modelling. The study was mainly based on current measurements in the outlet of a bay system (Tiirinselka-Lehesselka) of lake Paijanne with an acoustic current profiler and recordings of temperature profile. High currents in the hypolimnion were observed during periods of high stratification, when the flow in the hypolimnion is caused by the horizontal pressure gradient associated with the thermocline slope in the sound. In some cases the large water exchange was due to the seiches in main body of the lake. Water exchange and current velocity in the sound were clearly smaller when the water was homogeneous. This paper gives quantitative results of water exchange and its dependence on different factors for summer 1989.																			0018-8158					OCT 2	1992	243						351	357		10.1007/BF00007051	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007051													WOS:A1992JZ96300037
J	HOPPER, M; POWER, G				HOPPER, M; POWER, G			THE FISHERIES OF AN OJIBWAY COMMUNITY IN NORTHERN ONTARIO	ARCTIC												Subsistence fishing provides an important source of food for the remote Ojibwa community of Webequie, located along the Winisk River in northern Ontario. Field observations during the summer of 1988 were combined with a recall survey to estimate catches from October 1987 through September 1988. Of 133 potential fishermen, 90 were surveyed. The total community harvest was estimated to be 83 810 fish, round weight 108 210 kg. After adjustments, this provided 118 kg round weight/person/year, or 0.21 kg/person/day edible fish for consumption. Lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), walleye (Stizostedion vitreum), northern pike (Esox lucius) and suckers (Catostomus commersoni and C. catostomus) were dominant in the catch. Lake sturgeon (Acipenser fluvescens) attracts special fishing effort. Older males (> 40 years old) are the primary fishermen. Fixed gill nets take 95% of the harvest, most of which is consumed. Commercial fishing seems to be disappearing. Recreational fishing is a potential source of revenue. Subsistence fishing tends to be overlooked in development and management schemes but is clearly an important activity.																			0004-0843					DEC	1991	44	4					267	274																WOS:A1991GX23400002

In this study, we test the applicability of VIS-RS to lake sediments in Norway. On the one hand we use conventional, established algorithms for inferring organic content of sediments, on the other hand we test the potential of multivariate calibration techniques to infer organic content. For absolute quantification of organic content, conventional C-org measurements are needed when using conventional algorithms as well as when employing multivariate calibration techniques. Both, conventional algorithms and multivariate calibrations, result in estimates of organic content closely mirroring loss-on-ignition measurements. When using multivariate calibration techniques, a conventional C-org measurement every 5 cm is sufficient to obtain estimates of organic matter that are more accurate than those obtained by means of conventional algorithms. Therefore, the potential of multivariate calibration techniques and VIS-RS to substitute measurements of more time consuming and costly sediment parameters (e.g. clay minerals) should be tested.

The availability to phytoplankton of this P is inversely related to the Fe:P ratio in bottom waters. Using data from 51 lakes, we tested the hypothesis that sulfate concentration in lake water may be critical in controlling the Fe:P ratio in anoxic bottom waters. Results showed that Fe:P ratios in bottom waters of lakes were significantly (p<0.001) related to surface water sulfate concentrations. The higher Fe:P ratios in low sulfate systems is due not only to higher iron concentrations in anoxic bottom waters but also to lower P concentrations in anoxic waters. Thus, our results suggest that anthropogenically induced increases in sulfate concentrations of waters (e.g. from fossil fuel burning) may have a double effect on P cycling in lakes. Higher sulfate concentrations can both increase the magnitude of P release from sediments as well as increase the availability of P released from sediments into anoxic bottom waters.

Applying high -frequency GPR enables detailed surveying of the variation in river -Ice thickness and the boundary of floating and grounded (i.e., bottom fast) ice in a relatively large area. Extensive verification of river -ice thickness based on GPR profiling was performed by comparing the radar data with ground truth ice thickness measurements. This revealed that the GPR method is suitable for river -ice thickness calculation with a mean absolute error of +/- 3 cm, equivalent to 5% mean percentage error in the case of 50 -centimeter -thick ice, although snow cover on top of the ice or a possibly non -homogeneous ice surface reduces GPR measurement accuracy and the usability of the method for detailed ice -thickness measurements. The ice -thickness variation in a meandering river was observed to be quite large, with the maximum difference of 32 cm in mean ice thickness between cross sections. However, the observed mean ice thickness yielded a reasonable match with the theoretical mean thickness calculated with a widely used analytical ice -thickness growth equation. The vertically averaged flow velocities measured with an acoustic Doppler current profiler and bottom depths were surveyed from 148 boreholes, which enables discussing the influence of flow velocity and river morphology on the ice thickness's Variation.

A layer of clean medium to coarse sand with the average thickness of 35 cm was placed at the site in the summer of 1995. Concentration of Zn, Cr, and Cd in the original sediments reached values over 6000, 300 and 15 mu g/g, respectively. The predicted consolidation of the uppermost one meter of sediment was about 14 cm, which was in good agreement with values obtained from comparisons of moisture content values of pre-capping and post-capping cores. A thin layer of fresh moderately contaminated sediments has started to develop on the top of the cap. In general, the concentrations of elements were greater in porewater than in the overlying water, e.g., the concentration of Fe and soluble reactive phosphorus were 1000 times, and those of Mn 100 times greater. There was a significant reduction in the vertical fluxes of all the trace elements after the capping of the contaminated sediments. (C) 1998 IAWQ.

J	Fisher, JI; Mustard, JF				Fisher, JI; Mustard, JF			High spatial resolution sea surface climatology from Landsat thermal infrared data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												High spatial and temporal resolution maps of sea surface temperature (SST) have numerous applications in coastal and estuarine systems. A climatology map, tracking SST as a function of year-day, was produced at Southern New England using 53 Landsat TM and ETM+ thermal infrared data. A recursive curve-fitting algorithm was used to fit these data and eliminate cloud contamination, resulting in an average daily temperature at every 60-m pixel. The climatology was validated against long-term in situ records that were analyzed with the same techniques. The results show, as expected, that isolated and shallow water bodies undergo more extreme temperature variation ( -2 to 25 degreesC) than deeper, well-connected embayments (I to 21 degreesC) or the coastal ocean (4 to 18 degreesC). The coastal ocean is shown to lag insolation and shallow lakes by up to 44 days, with embayments showing a gradation between these extremes. Despite the Subtle temperature range variation, there is rich detail in the spatial patterns which are relevant to the applied sciences of coastal and estuarine systems. The spatial pattern of the climatology reveals anomalous patterns, such as occur where anthropogenic forcing alters climatological patterns. The heat budget of Mount Hope Bay in northeast Narragansett Bay has anthropogenic thermal input from a large power plant, and this input is reflected in the climatology. From the results, it is seen that Narragansett Bay has, on average, a mean annual temperature of 11.86 +/- 0.41 degreesC, while the Mount Hope Bay system is consistently warmer at 12.30 +/- 0.21 degreesC and shows a delayed response to autumn cooling. The long history of Landsat data acquisition can be used to create a climatology of coastal and estuarine scale dynamics at an order of magnitude finer scale resolution than AVHRR climatologies.

Pikas in the study population lived in burrows on an alpine steppe meadow. The dense population (> 100/ha) was structured in apparently monogamous family groups composed of a single adult male, a single adult female, older (half-grown) juveniles, and younger (newly weaned) juveniles. Individuals in all sex and age classes were frequently active and engaged in a wide variety of social and nonsocial behaviors. In addition, O. curzoniae exhibited a rich vocal repertoire of at least seven distinct calls. Social interactions and vocalizations associated with these interactions were most often expressed by younger juveniles. Older juveniles appeared intermediate between younger juveniles and adults in the expression of social behavior and utterance of calls. Most adult vocalizations were given in a nonsocial context. The highly social O. curzoniae is compared with the relatively unsocial North American pika (O. princeps), which occupies talus habitat at considerably lower densities (8 to 15/ha).																			8755-724X					WIN	1986	2	1					57	74																WOS:A1986AZK9500010

The lake's catchment played a significant role in the development of oasis states in the early Common Era, such as the ancient Loulan Kingdom. However, the history of lake dynamics remains unclear, and its potential linkage to the decline of Loulan Kingdom has been not well-examined. This paper aims to reconstruct the lake-level changes in Lop Nur over the last 2000 years using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of lacustrine and aeolian sediments, and radiocarbon (C-14) dating of ancient bio-remains. Furthermore, the relationships between Lop Nur' fluctuation and the decline of ancient Loulan Kingdom were discussed New hydrological insights for the region: The results suggest that Lop Nur once covered an area more than 11, 602 km(2) and that lake-level reduced gradually during 360-470 C.E. Subsequently, the lake experienced a few stages of lake-level fluctuation which never reached the upper-most shorelines. Also, the historical changes in the lake level were temporal coincided with the ancient Loulan Kingdom's collapse, showing that the dynamics of hydrological conditions in catchment may have a direct influence on the fall of human settlement in drylands.					shao, yun/KLC-3238-2024; Liu, Jiaqi/KHZ-9731-2024; Kang, Shugang/B-5955-2011															2214-5818				APR	2022	40								101002	10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.101002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.101002		JAN 2022											WOS:000820169000003

Previous studies using sediment cores showed that similar to 65% of the total P load entering Spring Lake, Michigan, came from the sediments, and that an alum concentration of 24 mg AI/L effectively inactivated P release in experimental sediment-core tubes. In 2004, we studied the influence of alum concentration and sediment resuspension. on P release rates from the sediments. Based on laboratory incubations using alum concentrations of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 mg/L, we determined that P release rates at alum concentrations >= 15 mg/L were no different than at release rates at concentrations of 25 mg/L. Resuspension of sediments substantially increased TP concentrations, even at high alum concentrations, but total soluble P concentrations remained low in the water when alum was present. Alum application may be an effective tool to reduce P flux from sediments in shallow lakes, but external P. load reduction must accompany alum application to address the long-term impacts associated with cultural eutrophication.					; Steinman, Alan/B-8723-2014	Steinman, Alan/0000-0002-4886-4305; Rediske, Richard/0000-0002-5048-1063; 													0887-3593					JUN	2006	25	2					304	312		10.1899/0887-3593(2006)25[304:FIIPLI]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1899/0887-3593(2006)25[304:FIIPLI]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000237891600004

Estimating the change in streamflow resulting from the 2003 and 2006/2007 bushfires in southeastern Australia	AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES												Significant bushfires occurred around the Great Dividing Range in south eastern Australia in the summers of 2003 and 2006/2007. The combined scale of these bushfires presents important hydrological implications for the region in the coming decades. This paper reports on results of a project funded by the Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment to perform a broad-scale assessment of the total water yield impact resulting from the two bushfires. Impacts are estimated in terms of annual changes in streamflow compared to conditions immediately prior to the 2003 bushfire. The modelling approach used to estimate the impacts on streamflow was the Bushfire Impact on Streamflow Yield model. Annual streamflow response curves were produced at each study catchment outlet, as well as spatially explicit datasets showing change in streamflow across the study catchment. Impacts from the two fires were then aggregated to estimate the total change in streamflow yield relative to flows into the River Murray, Eildon Reservoir and the Gippsland Lakes.																			1324-1583						2012	16	2					107	120		10.7158/W10-830.2013.16.2	http://dx.doi.org/10.7158/W10-830.2013.16.2													WOS:000211130700002

The crater is surrounded by an ejecta blanket represented by a polymict breccia layer that is preserved over an area of similar to6500 km(2). The later fall-back or suevite ejecta are preserved only in the crater overlying an impact-melt sheet. The ejecta blanket outside the crater is extensively eroded and varies in thickness from tens of meters at a distance of about 2-3 crater radii to 1-4 meters at 4-5 crater radii from the center of the structure. The farthest recorded distance of the ejecta is ca. 66 km or 5.5 crater radii to the W-N-W of the Boltysh structure. Fall-back ejecta from the Boltysh impact event include a suevite breccia layer, which now occurs only within the crater rim, where it overlies an impact melt sheet and the top of the central uplift in the crater. The thickness of the suevite layer varies from a few meters to up to 97 m in the eastern part of the crater. The Boltysh ejecta were deposited on top of Precambrian crystalline basement of the Ukrainian Shield over almost the entire extent of the ejecta blanket. Only within the nearby, about 140-Myr-old Rotmistrovka impact structure, 45 km NW of the Boltysh structure, do the Boltysh ejecta overlie older sediments, which comprise the post-impact sediments of that crater. There, up to 18 m of Boltysh ejecta overlie marls and chalk of Cenomanian-Turonian age, causing brecciation of the underlying chalk. Outside the crater rim the Boltysh ejecta layer is overlain by Middle Eocene sediments, but deposition of these sediments was preceded by extensive erosion of the Boltysh breccias. The post-impact sediments in the Boltysh structure are up to 550 m thick in the deepest parts of the crater. The lower series are sandstones and siltstones of closed freshwater lake origin, without any visible floral and faunal remains. The overlying series of shales and oil shales contain abundant remains of the Paleocene and Eocene paleoflora. These sediments are, in turn, covered by deposits of early to mid Eocene rocks and by more recent sediments of Neogene-Quaternary age. Thus, the stratigraphic age of the Boltysh impact crater, and its ejecta, is constrained to be between the Cenomanian-Turonian and the Paleocene. The most commonly quoted age for the Boltysh age is 88 +/- 3 Ma years, based on whole rock K-Ar ages of impact-melt rocks. However, our new data, derived by laser stepped heating and Spot 40Ar/39Ar dating of impact melt rocks, yields an age of 65.17 +/- 0.64 Ma. This age is in agreement with an earlier fission track age, and some recent biostratigraphic studies, indicating that the Boltysh crater was formed simultaneously with, or within a few hundred thousand years of, the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary age Chicxulub impact structure.

The ejecta blanket outside the crater is extensively eroded and varies in thickness from tens of meters at a distance of about 2-3 crater radii to 1-4 meters at 4-5 crater radii from the center of the structure. The farthest recorded distance of the ejecta is ca. 66 km or 5.5 crater radii to the W-N-W of the Boltysh structure. Fall-back ejecta from the Boltysh impact event include a suevite breccia layer, which now occurs only within the crater rim, where it overlies an impact melt sheet and the top of the central uplift in the crater. The thickness of the suevite layer varies from a few meters to up to 97 m in the eastern part of the crater. The Boltysh ejecta were deposited on top of Precambrian crystalline basement of the Ukrainian Shield over almost the entire extent of the ejecta blanket. Only within the nearby, about 140-Myr-old Rotmistrovka impact structure, 45 km NW of the Boltysh structure, do the Boltysh ejecta overlie older sediments, which comprise the post-impact sediments of that crater. There, up to 18 m of Boltysh ejecta overlie marls and chalk of Cenomanian-Turonian age, causing brecciation of the underlying chalk. Outside the crater rim the Boltysh ejecta layer is overlain by Middle Eocene sediments, but deposition of these sediments was preceded by extensive erosion of the Boltysh breccias. The post-impact sediments in the Boltysh structure are up to 550 m thick in the deepest parts of the crater. The lower series are sandstones and siltstones of closed freshwater lake origin, without any visible floral and faunal remains. The overlying series of shales and oil shales contain abundant remains of the Paleocene and Eocene paleoflora. These sediments are, in turn, covered by deposits of early to mid Eocene rocks and by more recent sediments of Neogene-Quaternary age. Thus, the stratigraphic age of the Boltysh impact crater, and its ejecta, is constrained to be between the Cenomanian-Turonian and the Paleocene. The most commonly quoted age for the Boltysh age is 88 +/- 3 Ma years, based on whole rock K-Ar ages of impact-melt rocks. However, our new data, derived by laser stepped heating and Spot 40Ar/39Ar dating of impact melt rocks, yields an age of 65.17 +/- 0.64 Ma. This age is in agreement with an earlier fission track age, and some recent biostratigraphic studies, indicating that the Boltysh crater was formed simultaneously with, or within a few hundred thousand years of, the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary age Chicxulub impact structure.																					3-540-00630-3				2003							179	202																WOS:000185214300008

TOC, mainly originating from the catchment, was the best predictor of concentrations and areal CO2 effluxes in the whole lake-area range, but among the lakes with an area, 1 km(2) having an anoxic hypolimnion during summer, the areal effluxes were also related to lake size and an index of turbulence. The concentration and areal effluxes of CH4 from the lakes' pelagic zones were related more closely to lake-size-related water column stability and turbulent mixing than directly to TOC. The total regional flux estimate from 619 lakes in the region of 1600 km(2) showed that seven lakes with an area of 10-50 km(2) were responsible for 57-69% of the pelagic CO2 effluxes and about half of the sum of pelagic and littoral CH4 effluxes from the lakes. The proportion accounted for by the small lakes (area < 1 km(2)) in the gas effluxes was 1.4-2.1 times higher, 18-26% for CO2 and 21-26% for CH4, than their areal proportion (12.5%) in the landscape, although numerically these small lakes predominate in the whole lake population (96%).																			0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2013	58	6					1915	1930		10.4319/lo.2013.58.6.1915	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2013.58.6.1915													WOS:000327395400002
J	Gutiérrez, JS; Soriano-Redondo, A				Gutierrez, Jorge S.; Soriano-Redondo, Andrea			Wilson's Phalaropes can double their feeding rate by associating with Chilean Flamingos	ARDEA												Birds often participate in mixed-species foraging associations to improve their feeding efficiency. Wilson's Phalaropes Steganopus tricolor wintering in saline lakes of the Atacama Desert, northern Chile, were found to feed either solitarily or in close proximity (commensally) to Chilean Flamingos Phoenicopterus chilensis. Those individuals following Chilean Flamingos were picking up prey (mainly copepods) stirred up by flamingos rapidly stomping their feet ('foot paddling'). In contrast, Wilson's Phalaropes ignored Andean Flamingos Phoenicoparrus andinus and Chilean Flamingos using different foraging tactics. Feeding rates of Wilson's Phalaropes associating with Chilean Flamingos (38 +/- 9 prey/min) were significantly higher than those of solitary phalaropes (17 +/- 6 prey/min), indicating that this association allows profitable feeding on small prey suspended in water. Although this association appears to involve a high benefit to Wilson's Phalaropes and a low cost (if any) to Chilean Flamingos, thus partly explaining the stability of mixed-species groups, it is restricted to moderate and deep foraging depths. Three other shorebird species (Baird's Sandpiper Calidris bairdii, Lesser Yellowlegs Tringa flavipes and Greater Yellowlegs Tringa melanoleuca) associated with the Chilean Flamingo at shallower foraging depths, indicating these facilitative interactions are species and context dependent.

J	Poysa, H				Poysa, H			Population estimates and the timing of waterfowl censuses	ORNIS FENNICA												The effect of the timing of waterfowl censuses on the estimates of breeding population sizes of different species was studied in southeast Finland from 1991 to 1994. Lakes used only for breeding and a local stop-over lake that was used for staging during spring migration were analysed separately. Also, the effect of the break-up of ice cover on the order of lake occupation by breeding pairs was studied. A standard waterfowl census was made four times in May at an interval of approximately seven days in each year. In general, the timing of waterfowl censuses within the three-week period considered did not cause serious biases in population estimates, though differences between species and between lake types were observed. The timing of the break-up of the ice cover was critical in the build-up of local breeding populations. However, pairs of many species, especially the Mallard, Teal, and Common Goldeneye occupied breeding lakes even when the lake still was considerably covered by ice. A comparison of recommended census times between earlier studies and this study suggests that in some species censuses could be started much earlier than previously recommended.

Identification of two distinct fire regimes in Southern California: implications for economic impact and future change	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The area burned by Southern California wildfires has increased in recent decades, with implications for human health, infrastructure, and ecosystem management. Meteorology and fuel structure are universally recognized controllers of wildfire, but their relative importance, and hence the efficacy of abatement and suppression efforts, remains controversial. Southern California's wildfires can be partitioned by meteorology: fires typically occur either during Santa Ana winds (SA fires) in October through April, or warm and dry periods in June through September (non-SA fires). Previous work has not quantitatively distinguished between these fire regimes when assessing economic impacts or climate change influence. Here we separate five decades of fire perimeters into those coinciding with and without SA winds. The two fire types contributed almost equally to burned area, yet SA fires were responsible for 80% of cumulative 1990-2009 economic losses ($3.1 Billion). The damage disparity was driven by fire characteristics: SA fires spread three times faster, occurred closer to urban areas, and burned into areas with greater housing values. Non-SA fires were comparatively more sensitive to age-dependent fuels, often occurred in higher elevation forests, lasted for extended periods, and accounted for 70% of total suppression costs. An improved distinction of fire type has implications for future projections and management. The area burned in non-SA fires is projected to increase 77% (+/- 43%) by the mid-21st century with warmer and drier summers, and the SA area burned is projected to increase 64% (+/- 76%), underscoring the need to evaluate the allocation and effectiveness of suppression investments.

This process is essential for Cyanobacteria development and can account for their dominance in eutrophic waters in summer. In order to determine the main regulating factors of those movements, we developed a mechanistic and deterministic model abased on differential equations, that simulates the vertical migration of Microcystis sp. In Microcystis, buoyancy regulation results from the dynamics of the carbohydrate reserve metabolism during photosynthesis. These fundamental processes are modelled daily by this vertical I-D model named Yoyo. It describes the movement of colonies. with different sizes in response to variations of environmental conditions. This paper presents the model sensitivity analysis. We individually investigated the role of light and temperature upon algal migration with colonies of two different diameters. Under a daily light cycle and a temperature of 20 degreesC, the model described vertical migration on a 48 h rhythm in colonies with a 300-mum diameter. (C) 2003 Academie des sciences.

Assessment of the annual diffusive methane emission from the southern tundra thermokarst lake of Western Siberia	TURBULENCE, ATMOSPHERE AND CLIMATE DYNAMICS	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science				International Conference on Turbulence, Atmospheric and Climate Dynamics	MAY 16-18, 2018	Moscow, RUSSIA					Lakes are among the most important natural sources of greenhouse gas methane (CH4). Although Western Siberia contains numerous thermokarst lakes, lake CH4 emissions from this region remain unknown. Here we report the results of field measurements of CH4 fluxes conducted by static chamber method in summer 2016 on thermokarst tundra lake "Ledyanoe". Based on the measured values, we estimated annual diffusive CH4 emission from the whole lake by using three approaches: one based on experimental data and two others utilizing modeled data and meteorological records. The quantified annual diffusive CH4 emission following first method was 135 kg C-CH4 year(-1) (97-197 kg C-CH4 year(-1) 95% confidence interval), whereas annual CH4 emission according to next two approaches was 150 kg C-CH4 year(-1) (148-151 kg C-CH4 year(-1) 95% confidence interval) and 131 kg C-CH4 year(-1) respectively. Such convergence between the results of different methods can be attributed to compliance of estimates with real annual emission.

HYDROBIOLOGIA												We determined clearance rates and ingestion rates of Daphnia galeata on bacteria and phytoplankton in order to test if bacteria are an important alternative food resource for daphnids during periods of low phytoplankton biomass in the biomanipulated Bautzen reservoir (Germany). D. galeata was able to feed on bacteria with the same efficiency as on algae during most of the time. In spite of similar clearance rates, bacteria ingestion was usually lower than phytoplankton ingestion due to lower bacterial biomass. Only at low biomass of algae in late fall and during the clear water phase, bacteria contributed up to 87% and 42%, respectively, to total carbon ingestion of D. galeata. However, even a short period of relatively high bacteria grazing by daphnids may be important for biomanipulation. Bacteria might bridge over periods of food limitation of daphnids thus promoting the maintenance of high Daphnia biomass. Therefore, ingestion of bacteria by daphnids is thought to stabilize biomanipulation and may hold a key position in the food web of biomanipulated lakes.

It has 60 .times. 16 square grid cells of 6.67-km mesh size and uses a time step of 12 h. The model was verified and found to be in reasonably good agreement with the Canada Center for Inland Waters (CCIW) monitor cruise data for Oct., Nov. and Dec. during which period there were high winds with high P concentrations being observed. Computed, daily averaged currents from a hydrodynamic model developed at CCIW are used for the transport terms and actual data for the lake boundary conditions. The physical regeneration is attributed to wave motions induced by wind. A formula is proposed which expresses the regenerated amount of total P in terms of wave orbital velocity and sediment mean grain size. A discussion is presented on the choice of the settling rate and the regeneration coefficient which produce satisfactory model results.																									1976	33	3					550	563		10.1139/f76-072	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f76-072													WOS:A1976BJ94800015

Yoko-Dovyren Layered Massif: Composition, Mineralization, Overburden and Dump Rock Utilization	MINERALS												Ultramafic-mafic complexes are widely developed in the Earth's crust. They contain deposits of various minerals. The Yoko-Dovyren intrusive in the North Baikal Region, Russia, is considered an example of an intrusive containing diverse mineralization: Ni-Cu, Platinum group elements, Cr, Zr, B, and blue diopside. During the development of the deposit, a huge amount of magnesium-containing rocks are moved to dumps and have a negative impact on the environment. To minimize this process, overburden and host rocks need to be involved in production, thereby avoiding the movement of rocks into dumps. The construction materials production is main industry using this rocks. Therefore, the purpose of these studies was to determine the quality of magnesium-containing rocks and the possibility of their use in construction. As a result of the complex works performed, it has been determined that these rocks have required physical and mechanical characteristics. Concretes in large and small aggregates from magnesium-containing rocks were obtained. It has been concluded that they are superior to concrete from granite rubble and quartz sand in terms of their strength indicators. The use of magnesium-containing rocks, without allowing them to fall into dumps, will allow us to create clean, environmentally safe mining enterprises.					; Khudyakova, Ludmila/J-9104-2018; Kislov, Evgeniy/ACR-3548-2022	Kislov, Evgeniy/0000-0003-2266-0942; 														2075-163X				AUG	2020	10	8							682	10.3390/min10080682	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/min10080682													WOS:000564672900001

Both fishes preferred habitat types characterized by structure-free sand or gravel substrates, but striped bass and hybrid striped bass did not exhibit significant diet overlap during the growing season. At approximately 120 mm total length (TL), juvenile moronids shifted from a diet of zooplankton and invertebrates to a diet primarily comprised of age-0 fishes. However, piscivorous striped bass primarily preyed on age-0 alewives Alosa pseudoharengus while hybrid striped bass consumed age-0 sunfishes Lepomis spp. The delayed stocking date of hybrid striped bass appeared to contribute to the dietary difference. Striped bass achieved mean total lengths of 229 and 173 mm by the end of the 2001 and 2002 growing seasons, respectively. Mean total lengths of hybrid striped bass stocked into the reservoir 3 months later than striped bass reached 133 mm at the end of the 2002 growing season. Overwinter loss of smaller (<150 mm TL) striped bass was observed for the 2001-2002 sampling period. Predation upon stocked fingerlings was not considered significant in limiting survival; only three fingerling moronids were found in the stomach contents of 200 potential predators captured near stocking sites. It does not appear that resource competition with hybrid striped bass during the growing season resulted in overwinter mortality of juvenile striped bass in our study. Delayed hybrid striped bass stocking may lessen the potential for trophic competition between striped bass and hybrid striped bass at early life stages.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-36-3				2013	80						229	247																WOS:000323292100014

In this study, a novel and improved empirical retracker (ImpMWaPP) is presented that can derive stable inland lake levels from Cryosat-2 synthetic aperture radar interferometer (SARin) waveforms. The retracker can extract a robust reference level for each track to handle multi-peak waveforms. To validate the lake levels derived by ImpMWaPP, the in situ gauge data of seven lakes in the Tibetan Plateau are used. Additionally, five existing retrackers are compared to evaluate the performance of the proposed ImpMWaPP retracker. The results reveal that ImpMWaPP can efficiently process the multi-peak waveforms of the Cryosat-2 SARin mode. The root-mean-squared errors (RMSEs) obtained by ImpMWaPP for Qinghai Lake, Nam Co, Zhari Namco, Ngoring Lake, Longyangxia Reservoir, Bamco, and Dawa Co are 0.085 m, 0.093 m, 0.109 m, 0.159 m, 0.573 m, 0.087 m, and 0.122 m, respectively. ImpMWaPP obtains the lowest mean RMSE (0.175 m) over the seven lakes, indicating that it extracts lake levels well during icing and no-ice periods, and is more suitable for lakes frozen in winter.

Using fossil records to inform reintroduction of the kakapo as a refugee species	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Many threatened species persist only as relict populations occupying a fraction of their former distribution, in habitats which may not be optimal for supporting viable populations. Following population growth of one such species, the kakapo (Strigops habroptilus), conservation managers are faced with the challenge of identifying suitable locations for reintroduction. Areas which support habitat conditions typical of those occupied by kakapo in the past have the greatest potential to support future populations. We collated occurrences of kakapo from recent fossil records, then used MaxEnt to model the past distribution of kakapo across New Zealand, and contemporary areas suitable for reintroductions based on extant habitat and present-day climate. We validated our models against three independent data sets of the most recent relict populations. Our models suggest that kakapo once occurred in mountain beech and Hall's totara or broadleaf forests with moderate to high precipitation and milder winters. Areas predicted to be environmentally suitable for kakapo in contemporary New Zealand include the west coast of the South Island, the west and north-east of the North Island and the southern side of Lake Taupo. Assuming that known threats of introduced predators can be managed, our study suggests that suitable kakapo habitat persists in New Zealand, and here we offer insight into locations for future population establishment. Given the finite carrying capacity of offshore islands, this is an important first step which will enable kakapo managers to prioritise focal areas and also highlights the benefits and potential pitfalls of using these modelling approaches for refugee species.

In this study, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) was adopted as an index of the lake water quality, and the spatial pattern of the average COD concentration during the summer from 1988 to 1991 was simulated by the model. It was suggested from the numerical result that the water quality in Lake Hamana was essentially influenced by the phytoplankton production, although the dissolved organic matter accounted for the major fraction of COD constituent in the lake. The evaluation of the biological processes over the whole lake region showed that the autochthonous COD flux associated with the primary production may be almost 10 times larger than the external loading flux. Because the phosphate turned out the most limiting nutrient to the phytoplankton production and most of the phosphorus pool in the water column appeared to be supplied from the sediment, it was considered that the benthic phosphorus flux would be the most critical factor to the autochthonous COD in the lake.

The original goat of SEP was to produce up to 86 000 metric tons (t) of salmon per year, and it has relied primarily on three major technologies to achieve this goal: hatcheries, spawning channels, and lake enrichment. We estimate that SEP's annual production is about 12 400 t of salmon per year. Thus, the program has fallen short of its objective. We show that SEP has devoted considerable effort in evaluating individual facilities and sites: however, SEP has been unable or unwilling to evaluate overall program success and direction. Due to natural variation in survival rates, it is difficult to determine, even after 15 yr, which technologies are likely to be successful. Furthermore, there is a paucity of information on wild stocks and the extent to which these enhancement activities have an effect on their numbers. We conclude that no technology has been proven, that 15 yr is insufficient to determine which technologies to explore, and that programs like SEP must rely on outside evaluation of overall program success and outside direction for program guidance.

This study examines two characteristic dust-storm events originated from these areas on 12?15 July 2016 and 27?28 May 2018. Thermal low-pressure systems over topographic-low areas and the Caspian Sea High, along with pressure gradients and intense surface winds over the dust sources facilitated the dust outbreaks and transport. Three models (DREAM-NMME-MACC, CAMS and WRF-Chem) are synergized to simulate the spatial distribution of AOD and surface dust concentrations during the dust events. The results show that DREAM-NMME-MACC and WRF-Chem exhibit the highest discrepancies (R = 0.15?0.58; RMSE = 83%? 125%) in representing the spatial and temporal distribution of dust compared to Terra-MODIS AODs, while CAMS reveals the best performance (R = 0.29?0.77; RSME = 67%?124%). All models significantly underestimate the high MODIS AODs, especially near the source areas, due to different dust schemes, soil conditions, meteorology and dynamic processes for dust emissions that they comprise. Furthermore, notable differences between the models are revealed in simulations of the PM10 concentrations in Zabol, east Iran, as the models fail to reproduce the temporal evolution and high intensity of the dust event. In general, all models represent better the dust storm originated from Sistan (13?14 July 2016) rather than the Aralkum dust storm (27?28 May 2018), indicating an incapability in representing the soil characteristics in a progressively drying terrain.					; Saadatabadi, abbas/W-6914-2019; Karami, Sara/JPY-2106-2023; Kaskaoutis, Dimitris/ABG-1498-2020; Alam, Khan/AAF-8602-2020; Rashki, Alireza/H-5577-2011	Karami, Sara/0000-0002-8372-763X; Rashki, Alireza/0000-0003-0213-7097; 													1875-9637	2212-1684				MAR	2021	50								100679	10.1016/j.aeolia.2021.100679	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aeolia.2021.100679		FEB 2021											WOS:000644991800001
J	BryantMason, A; Xu, YJ; Altabet, M				BryantMason, April; Xu, Y. Jun; Altabet, Mark			Isotopic signature of nitrate in river waters of the lower Mississippi and its distributary, the Atchafalaya	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Periodic summer hypoxia occurring in the Northern Gulf of Mexico has been attributed to large nutrient inputs, especially nitrate-nitrogen, from the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River system. The 2008 Gulf Hypoxia Action Plan calls for river corridor wetland restoration to reduce nitrate loads, but it is largely unknown how effective riverine wetland systems in the lower Mississippi River are for nitrate removal. We carried out an intensive isotope study to address this question by comparing nitrate isotopic signatures of the well-channelized Mississippi River with those of the Atchafalaya River, which has extensive floodplains and backwater swamps. We investigated changes in N-15(NO3) and O-18(NO3) for water samples collected biweekly to monthly over a 2-year period at the Atchafalaya River outlets (Morgan City and Wax Lake) and on the Mississippi River at Baton Rouge. In addition, in situ water quality parameters including temperature, dissolved oxygen and pH were recorded for each sampling date. Waters from both rivers showed moderately high nitrate concentration (>1mgl(-1)) and undetectable (< 0.01mgl(-1)) nitrite throughout the study period. The Mississippi River had slightly, but significantly higher (p=0.01) mean nitrate concentrations (1.5mgl(-1)) and higher N-15(NO3) (7.7 parts per thousand) than the Atchafalaya (1.1mgl(-1), 7.0 parts per thousand); while no difference in O-18(NO3) (4.6 parts per thousand) was found between the rivers. Flux-weighted mean isotope values were overall lower than mean values for both the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers, with a greater difference between the two rivers (7.4 parts per thousand versus 6.5 parts per thousand, respectively). River flooding and hurricane storm surge also appeared to affect nitrate isotopic values. The lack of large difference in isotopic values between the Atchafalaya and Mississippi Rivers suggests that the majority of nitrate is transported through the Atchafalaya River with relatively little processing, and that riverine floodplains and wetlands are not effective sinks for nitrate, as previously assumed, because of insufficient residence time and well-oxygenated river waters.

J	Putnam, M				Putnam, Michael			The Redemption of Matter: Margaret Fuller's Fluid Ethics	JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF RELIGION NATURE AND CULTURE												Despite her biographical proximity to figures such as Emerson and Thoreau, the nineteenth-century writer and editor Margaret Fuller is not often considered an environmentalist. Indeed, she is more often remembered for her contributions to political feminism than to environmentalism. I argue that in Fuller's writing, however, an environmental ethics emerges in conjunction with her questioning of the binary between 'matter' and 'spirit'. In place of this binary, Fuller proposed fluidity. This is evidenced in her first book, Summer on the Lakes, a literary travelogue chronicling Fuller's journey through the West. With recourse to theoretical concerns in feminist new materialisms, I first demonstrate how her understanding of fluidity was influenced by the nineteenth-century vitalist theory of animal magnetism. I then turn to the ways that Fuller takes her encounters with the West's watery sites-its waterfalls, rivers, and lakes-as occasions to articulate an anticolonial environmental ethics.																			1749-4907	1749-4915					2022	16	3			SI		350	369		10.1558/jsrnc.23069	http://dx.doi.org/10.1558/jsrnc.23069													WOS:000905158600003
J	NORTHCOTE, TG; LARKIN, PA				NORTHCOTE, TG; LARKIN, PA			INDICES OF PRODUCTIVITY IN BRITISH COLUMBIA LAKES	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												The relation between physical and chemical indices of production and standard crops of plankton, bottom fauna and fish was examined in 100 British Columbia lakes. A significant increase in plankton and fish quantities with increase in total dissolved solid content of lake waters was demonstrated and a similar relationship suggested for bottom fauna. Although the general form of the relationship between mean depth and plankton, and between bottom fauna and fish quantity, suggested a hyperbolic curve with larger quantities in lakes of low mean depth, the only generalization which seemed justified was that quantities of fauna from lakes of great mean depth were never as high as those found in some lakes of low mean depth. No significant relation was found between intensity and length of growing season and quantities of plankton, bottom fauna or fish, although a significant relationship was demonstrated between summer epilimnion temperature and plankton. In a multiple regression analysis using all lakes the predominance of total dissolved solids over mean depth in affecting summed indices of lake fauna was shown. However, for lakes in the southern interior plateau, one of the 9 regions distinguished in British Columbia, no significant relation could be demonstrated between mean depth or total dissolved solids and summed indices of fauna or plankton alone. Thus total dissolved solid content of the water appeared to be the most important factor in determining the general level of productivity in lakes studied throughout the province, although within a region neither total dissolved solids nor mean depth could be used either singly or together to predict plankton, bottom fauna or fish quantities.																									1956	13	4					515	540		10.1139/f56-032	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f56-032													WOS:A1956WX36700005
J	LEAN, DRS; KNOWLES, R				LEAN, DRS; KNOWLES, R			NITROGEN TRANSFORMATIONS IN LAKE-ONTARIO	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Concentrations of ammonium plus nitrite in Lake Ontario were highly correlated with ammonium regeneration from zooplankton excretion (r=0.966), inferring that elevated nitrite concentrations result from nitrification. Nitrapyrin-sensitive dark 14C-labeled bicarbonate assays confirmed high rates of nitrification by chemoautotrophic bacteria. 15N-labeled nitrate experiments showed that nitrate, not ammonium, was the principal form of N used for total microbial protein synthesis. Size fractionation experiments also suggested that small cells were responsible for most of the ammonium uptake, while large cells used mostly nitrate. Nitrate depletion in the surface waters during summer stratification resulted from movement to particulate N, nitrite, and ammonium as well as losses in particulate N due to sedimentation. At least one third, however, was unaccounted for (i.e. 30 mg N .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. d-1) and may have been converted to protein which would move up the food chain to larger organisms (e.g. fish) not sampled during conventional water chemistry. nitrous oxide profiles showed that nitrate losses through denitrification are unlikely to occur. Consequently, unless nitrate loading to Lake Ontario is reduced, nitrate concentrations should be expected to continue to increase.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				DEC	1987	44	12					2133	2143		10.1139/f87-262	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f87-262													WOS:A1987M856600010

Plants grown in a greenhouse on a uniform sediment within pH-controlled tanks all survived 60 days at pH 5 but showed reduced dry matter accumulation (by 76%), leaf area (by 79%), and rosette and winter bud production (by 44 and 63%, respectively) compared with plants grown at pH 7.5. The sensitivity of this plant to only moderate acidity did not differ for plants in water acidified to pH 5 by a combination of H2SO4 and HNO3 or by HCl, indicating that the former acids exerted no fertilizing effects to counter the detrimental influence of acidification. Tissue nitrogen and phosphorus levels were well above the critical concentrations previously reported for this species. Tissue calcium and manganese concentrations showed no clear relationship to treatment pH. Both aluminum and iron levels in tissues were twofold to threefold higher for the smaller plants grown at pH 5 (means of 1970 and 3090 .mu.g/g, respectively), suggesting that metal toxicity may have caused growth reduction at low pH.																			0008-4026					FEB	1986	64	2					306	310		10.1139/b86-044	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b86-044													WOS:A1986A654500008

The heavy metals were assessed by factor analysis, the results of which showed positive and/or negative correlations among Fe, Mn, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, and Cd. Factor analysis also indicated that heavy metals in the sediments of the study area have different natural and anthropogenic sources. Similarly, a sediment pollution assessment was done using the Geoaccumulation Index (Igeo), Enrichment Factor (EF), and Pollution Load Index (PLI). The Geoaccumulation Index indicated that the surface sediment of the Tupilipalem Coast was extremely contaminated with Fe, Mn, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn. The calculation of enrichment factors showed a significant enrichment with respect to Pb, Zn, and Cd and a moderate enrichment with Cr, Cu, and Ni. The falling trend of average contents' enrichment factors is Cd > Pb > Zn > Cu > Cr > Ni > Mn > Fe. The PLI values of the Cd show higher ( > 1) values due to the influence of distinct external sources like agricultural runoff, industrial activities, and other anthropogenic inputs. Ninety two percent of heavy metals under study showed the highest concentrations at station TP-5 where the Buckingham Canal and other agricultural and aquacultural effluents connect with the Bay of Bengal. This location is the second inlet which is periodically closed and it seemed that these parts of the study area are heavily affected by anthropogenic pollution.

J	Al-Farraj, A				Al-Farraj, Asma			Desert pavement development on the lake shorelines of Lake Eyre (South), South Australia	GEOMORPHOLOGY												To the southwest of Lake Eyre (South), South Australia, silcrete boulders exposed by the erosion of the surrounding fine sediments undergo mechanical weathering to form desert pavement. Successive palaeoshorelines of Lake Eyre have exposed an age-related sequence of different stages in the weathering of the boulders. This Study investigates desert pavement development in this saline environment. In addition, it attempts to develop a model for the development of desert pavement following exposure of the silcrete boulders, based on palaeo-lake shorelines dated from previous studies. Seven stages can be recognised corresponding to stages of soil and pavement development. Prior to stage oil e is the actual exposure of the boulder as the result of erosion by wave action at the lake shoreline OF by erosion as the lake level falls during desiccation. At stage-1 the upper surface of the boulder breaks up through mechanical weathering (salt weathering), while the rest of the boulder is still buried. At stage-2 the Surface fragments fall to the edge of the stone and expose more of the stone, which Continues to break-Up. There is no soil development in stages 1 and 2. By stage-3 most of the stone is exposed and broken up, making a mini-hill. At this stage soil development begins with the accumulation of sandy soil between the rock fragments. At stage-4 the stories form small cones and the soil is more developed. It is sandy with a typical of colour 10 YR 6/6. At stage-5 the stones forming the small cone are completely fragmented. Stone fragments at the centre are very angular but smoother at the edges of the mini-hill as the result of weathering (etching by chemical processes?). Soil texture is silty/sand and soil colour is 7.5 YR 6/6. At stage-6 the Surface is nearly flat. The soil is sandy/silt and Soil colour is between 7.5 YR 5/6 and 7.5 YR 5/8. Stage-7a is the gibber plain phase, composed of small well rounded stones, as a result of continued etching of the edges of the fragmented stones. The soil is silty, and the Soil colour is between 5 YR 5/6 and 5 YR 5/8. Stage-7b is also gibber plain, with small well rounded stone fragments but where the soil has been replaced by crystalline gypsum. This sequence differs from sequences described in other areas, especially on alluvial fan or terrace Surfaces. This may be partly due to the different origin of the clasts, as "pre-weathered" silcrete boulders, and partly due to the importance of chemical weathering by "etching" in this salt-rich environment.

J	Thomas, G; Eckmann, R				Thomas, Gregor; Eckmann, Reiner			The influence of eutrophication and population biomass on common whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) growth -: the Lake Constance example revisited	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Accelerated growth of freshwater fish during anthropogenic eutrophication has been attributed almost exclusively to the increased nutrient content, while density-dependent effects have been largely neglected. We evaluated the relative importance of these factors by studying the growth of 43 consecutive year classes of common whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) from Upper Lake Constance. This prealpine lake underwent eutrophication from the 1950s to 1970s, followed by reoligotrophication. Because whitefish are harvested with gill nets in a strongly size-selective way, we used back-calculated lengths of average fast-growing fish to compare growth among cohorts. Standing stock biomass was estimated based upon virtual year-class strengths. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that growth of whitefish during their second year was most strongly related to standing stock biomass followed by PO4-P content during spring turnover and by calendar year, which was incorporated as a third independent variable (adjusted R-2 = 0.84). The negative correlation between whitefish growth rate and calendar year is interpreted as evidence of an evolutionary response to the highly size-selective fishery during at least four decades. We conclude that density-dependent effects on whitefish growth are more important than had been realized previously and that the impact of eutrophication on growth of whitefish needs to be reconsidered.

Anoxia decreases the magnitude of the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus sink in freshwaters	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Oxygen availability is decreasing in many lakes and reservoirs worldwide, raising the urgency for understanding how anoxia (low oxygen) affects coupled biogeochemical cycling, which has major implications for water quality, food webs, and ecosystem functioning. Although the increasing magnitude and prevalence of anoxia has been documented in freshwaters globally, the challenges of disentangling oxygen and temperature responses have hindered assessment of the effects of anoxia on carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations, stoichiometry (chemical ratios), and retention in freshwaters. The consequences of anoxia are likely severe and may be irreversible, necessitating ecosystem-scale experimental investigation of decreasing freshwater oxygen availability. To address this gap, we devised and conducted REDOX (the Reservoir Ecosystem Dynamic Oxygenation eXperiment), an unprecedented, 7-year experiment in which we manipulated and modeled bottom-water (hypolimnetic) oxygen availability at the whole-ecosystem scale in a eutrophic reservoir. Seven years of data reveal that anoxia significantly increased hypolimnetic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations and altered elemental stoichiometry by factors of 2-5x relative to oxic periods. Importantly, prolonged summer anoxia increased nitrogen export from the reservoir by six-fold and changed the reservoir from a net sink to a net source of phosphorus and organic carbon downstream. While low oxygen in freshwaters is thought of as a response to land use and climate change, results from REDOX demonstrate that low oxygen can also be a driver of major changes to freshwater biogeochemical cycling, which may serve as an intensifying feedback that increases anoxia in downstream waterbodies. Consequently, as climate and land use change continue to increase the prevalence of anoxia in lakes and reservoirs globally, it is likely that anoxia will have major effects on freshwater carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus budgets as well as water quality and ecosystem functioning.

Browning-related oxygen depletion in an oligotrophic lake	INLAND WATERS												In recent decades, terrestrial dissolved organic matter (DOM) has increased in many northeastern North American and European lakes and is contributing to long-term browning. We used a long-term dataset (1988-2014) to study the consequences of browning-related decreased water transparency on dissolved oxygen dynamics in 2 small temperate lakes in Pennsylvania, USA, that differ in their dissolved organic carbon concentrations. The oligotrophic ("clearer") lake has low productivity and historically oxygenated deep waters. The mesotrophic-slightly dystrophic ("browner") lake also has relatively low productivity but historically anoxic deep waters. We examined whether browning coincided with changes in summer dissolved oxygen dynamics, with a focus on deep-water oxygen depletion. In the clearer lake, we found that minimum oxygen concentrations decreased by similar to 4.4 mg L-1 over the 27-year period, and these changes were strongly associated with both decreased water transparency and increased water column stability. We also found a shallowing of the maximum dissolved oxygen depth by similar to 4.5 m and anoxic conditions established in more recent years. In the browner lake, the metrics we used did not detect any significant changes in dissolved oxygen, supporting the prediction that vertical temperature and oxygen patterns in clearer lakes may be more sensitive to increasing DOM than darker lakes. Anoxia is traditionally considered to be a consequence of anthropogenic nutrient loading and, more recently, a warming climate. We show that browning is another type of environmental change that may similarly result in anoxia in oligotrophic lakes.

These fish had flowing eggs and semen and were suspected to be actively spawning in Maumee Bay. To investigate the potential of walleye spawning, we used a benthic pump to sample for eggs at five sites adjacent to the Maumee River channel and one site near Turtle Island in Maumee Bay on 5 April 1998, a time when walleye were actively spawning in rivers and on mid-lake reefs. We found walleye eggs at each of the six sites sampled. Relative abundance of eggs ranged from 17 to 2,105 per 2-min sample, with a mean of 459 ( 232). Egg viability ranged from 33 to 54% across the sites and 10% of the viable walleye eggs were observed to be in late stages of embryonic development indicating that egg survival to hatching is likely. These results are the first documentation of walleye spawning in Maumee Bay, indicating that Maumee Bay is a viable spawning location for walleye, possibly representing an important source of recruitment for the Lake Erie stock.

A precise sediment core chronology is a fundamental prerequisite for reconstructing past climate and environment changes. However, radiocarbon dates on bulk carbon in lake sediment cores are subject to "old carbon" reservoir effects, which can cause problems when trying to establish depth-age relations for sediment cores, especially those from the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Here we present a varve chronology that spans the last similar to 2000 years, from Jiang Co, on the central TP. Clastic-biogenic varves in Jiang Co sediments are comprised of two laminae, a coarse-grain and a fine-grain layer, observed by petrographic microscope and Electron Probe Micro Analyzer. The varve chronology is supported by Pb-210 and Cs-137 dating and was used to estimate the radiocarbon reservoir ages for the past similar to 2000 years. The thickness percentage of the coarse-grain layer within a single varve was used as a proxy for summer precipitation amount, as coarse grains are transported mainly by runoff. During the past 2000 years, the precipitation record inferred from Jiang Co sediments shows centennial-scale fluctuations that are consistent with other records from the region. The varve chronology from Jiang Co provided a valuable opportunity to estimate the "old carbon" reservoir effect in Jiang Co and reconstruct past precipitation on the Tibetan Plateau.					; Aquino López, Marco/AAX-4063-2021; Hou, Juzhi/W-5655-2018	Ji, Kejia/0000-0002-9786-7027; Hou, Juzhi/0000-0002-8512-5739													0921-2728	1573-0417				DEC	2021	66	4					439	452		10.1007/s10933-021-00215-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-021-00215-8		AUG 2021											WOS:000685597600001

However, factors that control BSR and its coupling to organic carbon (OC) mineralization in seasonally hypoxic reservoirs remain unclear. The present study elucidates the coupling processes by analyzing the concentrations and isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and sulfur (SO42-, sulfide) species, and the microbial community in water of the Aha reservoir, SW China, which has high SO(4)(2-)concentra-tion due to the inputs from acid mine drainage about twenty years ago. The water column at two sites in July and October revealed significant thermal stratification. In the hypoxic bottom water, the delta C-13-DIC decreased while the delta S-34-SO(4)(2-)increased, implying organic carbon mineralization due to BSR. The magnitude of S isotope fractionation (Delta S-34, obtained from delta S-34(sulfate)-delta S-34(sulfide)) during the process of BSR fell in the range of 3.4 parts per thousand to 27.0 parts per thousand in July and 21.6 parts per thousand to 31.8 parts per thousand in October, suggesting a change in the community of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). The relatively low water column stability in October compared to that in July weakened the difference of water chemistry and ultimately affected the SRB diversity. The production of DIC (Delta DIC) scaled a strong positive relationship with the Delta S-34 in July (p < 0.01), indicating that high OC availability favored the survival of incomplete oxidizers of SRB. However, in October, Delta C-13-DIC was correlated with the Delta S-34 in the bottom hypoxic water (p < 0.01), implying that newly degraded OC depleted in C-13 could favor the dominance of complete oxidizers of SRB which caused greater S isotope fractionation. Moreover, the sulfide supplied by BSR might stimulate the reductive dissolution of Fe and Mn oxides (Fe(O)OH and MnO2). The present study helps to understand the coupling of C and Sin seasonally hypoxic reservoirs characterized by high SO(4)(2-)concentration.

J	Prasad, S; Baier, J				Prasad, Sushma; Baier, Janina			Tracking the impact of mid- to late Holocene climate change and anthropogenic activities on Lake Holzmaar using an updated Holocene chronology	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												The mid- to late Holocene interval is characterised by a highly variable climate in response to a gradual change in orbital insolation. The seasonal impact of these changes on the Eifel Maar region is not yet well documented largely due to uncertainties about the completeness of this archive ("missing varves" in the well known Lake Holzmaar) and a limited understanding of the factors (e.g. temperature, precipitation) influencing the seasonality archived within the lamination/varves. In this study we approach these challenges from a different perspective. Using detailed microfacies investigations we: (1) demonstrate that the ambiguity about the "missing varves" is related to the climate induced complex biotic and abiotic laminations that led to mis-identification of varves; (2) use a combination of detailed microfacies investigations (varve structure, seasonality of biotic and abiotic signals), lamination quality, varve counts on multiple cores, published and new radiocarbon dates to develop a continuous master chronology based on the Bayesian modelling approach. The dates of major climate, volcanic, and archaeological event(s) determined using our model are in good agreement with the independently determined ages of the same events from other archives, confirming the accuracy of our age model; (3) test the sensitivity of the seasonal proxies to the available data on mid-Holocene changes in temperature and precipitation; (4) demonstrate that the changes in lake eutrophicity are correlative with temperature changes in NW Europe and probably triggered by solar variability; and (5) show that the early Iron Age onset of eutrophication in Lake Holzmaar was climate induced and began several decades before the impact of anthropogenic activity was seen in the form of intensified detrital erosion in the catchment area. Our work has implications for understanding the impact of climate change and anthropogenic activities on limnological systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Differential leaf-litter processing by native (Gammarus pulex) and invasive (Dikerogammarus villosus) freshwater crustaceans under environmental extremes	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. There is increasing interest in understanding the implications of biological invasions within the context of ecosystem functioning. Non-native crustaceans are of particular interest within fresh waters because of their important contributions to leaf-litter processing. The alien amphipod Dikerogammarus villosus is spreading rapidly through Europe where it has displaced native gammarids including Gammarus pulex. The resultant change in shredder communities has considerable implications for the dynamics of resource availability within invaded systems. 2. The invasive success of D. villosus has been attributed to many characteristics, including its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions and to exploit a wide feeding niche. These characteristics are thought to give D. villosus an advantage over native species, especially in habitats subject to changing environmental conditions. 3. The leaf (Salix alba) shredding efficiency, defined as the leaf mass consumed over the 4-day experiment per amphipod-day, was measured for D. villosus and G. pulex under extreme temperature and conductivity conditions, in single species and mixed species aquaria. 4. At high temperatures (25 degrees C), D. villosus shredded significantly more leaves than size-matched G. pulex. Conductivity extremes had no species effect; overall leaf-shredding efficiency was significantly greater at low conductivity (250 S cm(-1)) than high conductivity (1870 S cm(-1)). 5. An inspection of daily leaf disc consumption found that the two species showed significantly different leaf consumption patterns, with D. villosus consuming more leaves earlier in the experiment. 6. These results suggest that D. villosus invasion could lead to ecosystem-level changes in leaf processing, such as greater leaf processing earlier in autumn and at higher temperatures, which could alter nutrient dynamics and community assemblages within invaded systems. Such effects may not be reflected in biotic indices used to assess ecological status, as these indices do not currently distinguish between native and invasive species in the same family.

J	Myrick, CA; Cech, JJ				Myrick, CA; Cech, JJ			Temperature influences on California rainbow trout physiological performance	FISH PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY												Although thermal influences on the physiology of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) have been widely studied, there is little information about the responses of different genetic strains to temperatures. The effects of water temperature (10, 14, 19, 22, and 25 degrees C) on food consumption rate, growth rate, gross conversion efficiency, resting routine oxygen consumption rate, upper critical thermal tolerance and critical swimming velocity were investigated in juvenile rainbow trout of the Eagle Lake (O. m. aquilarum) subspecies and the Mt. Shasta strain. No strain-related differences in conversion efficiency, oxygen consumption rates, thermal tolerance or swimming performance were observed in 1995 (19, 22, and 25 degrees C) or 1996 (10, 14, and 19 degrees C), but Mt. Shasta strain trout grew faster at highest temperatures than did Eagle Lake trout. Food consumption rates, growth rates, conversion efficiency, and oxygen consumption rates declined at the extreme temperatures (10 and 25 degrees C) in both Eagle Lake and Mt. Shasta trout. Swimming performance was temperature-independent between 10 and 19 degrees C (overall mean: 5.43 body lengths s(-1)).																			0920-1742					APR	2000	22	3					245	254		10.1023/A:1007805322097	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1007805322097													WOS:000087909200008
J	Oren, A				Oren, Aharon			Cyanobacteria in hypersaline environments: biodiversity and physiological properties	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Within the cyanobacterial world there are many species adapted to life in hypersaline environments. Some can even grow at salt concentrations approaching NaCl saturation. Halophilic cyanobacteria often form dense mats in salt lakes, and on the bottom of solar saltern ponds, hypersaline lagoons, and saline sulfur springs, and they may be found in evaporite crusts of gypsum and halite. A wide range of species were reported to live at high salinities. These include unicellular types (Aphanothece halophytica and similar morphotypes described as Euhalothece and Halothece), as well as non-heterocystous filamentous species (Coleofasciculus chthonoplastes, species of Phormidium, Halospirulina tapeticola, Halomicronema excentricum, and others). Cyanobacterial diversity in high-salt environments has been explored using both classic, morphology-based taxonomy and molecular, small subunit rRNA sequence-based techniques. This paper reviews the diversity of the cyanobacterial communities in hypersaline environments worldwide, as well as the physiological adaptations that enable these cyanobacteria to grow at high salt concentrations. To withstand the high osmotic pressure of their surrounding medium, halophilic cyanobacteria accumulate organic solutes: glycine betaine is the preferred solute in the most salt-tolerant types; Coleofasciculus produces the heteroside glucosylglycerol, and the less salt-tolerant cyanobacteria generally accumulate the disaccharides sucrose and trehalose under salt stress. Some cyanobacteria growing in benthic mats in hypersaline environments are adapted to life under anoxic conditions and they can use sulfide as an alternative electron donor in an anoxygenic type of photosynthesis through a process which involves photosystem I only.

J	Trofaier, AM; Rees, WG				Trofaier, Anna Maria; Rees, W. Gareth			The suitability of using ASTER GDEM2 for terrain-based extraction of stream channel networks in a lowland Arctic permafrost catchment	FENNIA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY												Seasonally inundated areas and water-saturated soils are common features of lowland Arctic and sub-Arctic permafrost environments. With the onset of snow melt, and water percolation down through the snowpack, a principal factor controlling stream channel flow, aside from active layer depth, is topography. This paper investigates stream channel networks derived from the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER) global digital elevation model (GDEM) version 2 in a static terrain-based GIS-model. The suitability of using the ASTER GDEM2 for modelling the drainage network over a low-relief terrain is assessed. The aim is to use GDEM2 for the analysis of the stream channel network and to establish the network's connectivity to previously observed spring flood patterns over the Yamal peninsula. As such, there are two parts to this study: 1) DEM validation and 2) stream channel network analysis. The results of the DEM validation study show that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the GDEM2 and reference data is approx. 10 m when compared to both reference data sets (RMSE = 12.17 m, N = 86 and RMSE = 9.64, N = 506,877), implying that the GDEM2 is sufficiently accurate for terrain-based modelling. The low connectivity between the stream channel network and seasonal inundation suggests that topographic controls play a less important role compared to the possible overbanking of lakes and basin overflow. However, drainage densities for investigated drainage basins were significantly lower than those expected from typical Arctic basins. Both more sophisticated modelling techniques as well as higher spatial resolution DEMs are needed to extract the stream channel network more accurately and hence establish a more comprehensive link between the drainage network and seasonally inundated areas.

J	Leathers, DJ; Ellis, AW				Leathers, DJ; Ellis, AW			Synoptic mechanisms associated with snowfall increases to the Lee of Lakes Erie and Ontario	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Snowfall is a cyrospheric variable that impacts nearly every sector of society. Because of its societal importance, snowfall is a logical variable to be used as an indicator of potential global environmental change. This study investigates the mechanisms responsible for large observed snowfall increases across the eastern Great Lakes region of the USA. Results indicate that mean snowfall amounts across sections of western New York and north-western Pennsylvania have increased by up to 100 cm over the 60-year period encompassing the snowfall seasons 1930-1931 through to 1989-1990. A synoptic climatological approach is utilized to identify consistent synoptic-scale atmospheric patterns responsible for snowfall across the region. Nine synoptic types are identified as producing significant snowfall in the study area; five with synoptic characteristics indicative of lake-effect snowfall and four evidencing characteristics of snowfall associated with cyclonic influence. An examination of the seasonal frequency of the nine synoptic types indicates a substantial increase in the frequency of the five lake-effect synoptic types and a long-term decrease in the numbers of cyclone synoptic types over the period 1950-1951 through to 1981-1982. Information concerning trends in the frequency and the intensity of each of the nine snowfall-producing synoptic types was combined to produce a modelled snowfall change due to frequency and intensity variations over the period. Trends in the frequency and intensity of the synoptic patterns associated with lake-effect snowfall explain the majority of the observed snowfall increase across the region. Variations in the synoptic types associated with cyclonically induced snowfall are shown to be unimportant to snowfall changes across the eastern Great Lakes area. Possible reasons for increases in the frequency and the intensity of the lake-effect synoptic types are discussed.					; Leathers, Daniel/A-3665-2010	Leathers, Daniel/0000-0001-9002-9031; 													0899-8418					OCT	1996	16	10					1117	1135																WOS:A1996VU45300004

Most precipitation in the study area occurred during March-June. Short-duration precipitation events (1-6 h) accounted for 73.6% of the total. The average annual number of precipitation hours in the study area was 1028, 36 of which were heavy precipitation events, and both indices showed significant upward trends. The average hourly precipitation intensity in the study area was 1.58 mm/h, with an average of 28.6 mm/h in heavy precipitation events, and both indices showed increasing trends but with lower rates of change. On average, 202 precipitation events occurred annually with a speed of increase of 0.6 times/yr and a rate of growth of 3.0%/decade. Spatially, there have been significant increases in hours of precipitation and frequency of precipitation events at most stations in the northern Poyang Lake Basin, and a significant increase in heavy precipitation at some stations in eastern parts of the central region. It is imperative that effective disaster prevention and reduction measures are adopted in this area to mitigate the effects of heavy precipitation.

Low dissolved inorganic nitrogen and increased heterocyte frequency: precursors to Anabaena planktonica blooms in a temperate, eutrophic reservoir	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The relationship between heterocyte frequency, water temperature, nutrient concentrations and densities of Anabaena planktonica was examined in monomictic, eutrophic Lower Karori Reservoir (max. depth 21 m, area 0.034 km(2)), Wellington, New Zealand. Anabaena planktonica formed blooms and strongly dominated the phytoplankton assemblage during summer. The development of blooms of A. planktonica was associated with the set-up of stratification and increases in surface water temperature, with the peak of the bloom almost synchronous with maximum water temperature. The annual peak in heterocyte frequency preceded the bloom and occurred during a period of intensifying stratification. At this time, there were sustained low concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN: nitrate-N + ammonium-N) and the lowest ratios of DIN to soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), though ratios of total nitrogen to total phosphorus (TN:TP) were more variable. The apparent increase in nitrogen fixation capacity, based on increased heterocyte frequency, appears to be an important prerequisite to bloom formation for A. planktonica in the Lower Karori Reservoir. Monitoring heterocyte frequency may be a useful predictor for the occurrence of blooms of heterocytous cyanobacteria in eutrophic lakes due to the asynchronous nature of development of nitrogen limitation, heterocytes and vegetative cells.

J	Davis, JA				Davis, JA			The long-term fate of polychlorinated biphenyls in San Francisco Bay (USA)	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												A simple one-box mass budget model is presented as a first step toward a quantitative understanding of the long-term fate of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in San Francisco Bay (USA). Sensitivity analysis indicated that the most influential input parameters were degradation half-life in sediment, K-ow, outflow, average PCB concentration in sediment, and depth of the active sediment layer. Moderately influential parameters included organic carbon content of suspended solids, sediment burial mass transfer coefficient, and Henry's law constant. If external loading could be eliminated entirely, the mass of PCBs in the bay is predicted to drop to half of the present value in 20 years. The model predicts that sustained loading of 10 kg year(-1) would prevent the total PCB mass in the bay from ever dropping below 10% of the present mass. With a sustained loading of 20 kg year(-1), the model predicts that the total PCB mass would never fall below about 25% of the present mass. The half-lives in the bay for the individual PCB congeners evaluated in this report ranged from four years for PCB 18 to 30 years for PCB 194.																			0730-7268					OCT	2004	23	10					2396	2409		10.1897/03-373	http://dx.doi.org/10.1897/03-373								15511101					WOS:000223938100013
J	Hartmann, K; Wünnemann, B				Hartmann, Kai; Wuennemann, Bernd			Hydrological changes and Holocene climate variations in NW China, inferred from lake sediments of Juyanze palaeolake by factor analyses	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					RACHAD Workshop on Pattern of Holocene Change in Central Asia	JUL 25-27, 2006	Lanzhou Univ, Lanzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA		Lanzhou Univ			The eastern Juyanze palaeolake in hyperarid north-western China (41.75-42 degrees N, 101.5-102 degrees E) provides evidence of a complex hydrological pattern during the Holocene. Multivariate statistics based on lithological, geochemical and mineral data from the reference site G36 in the centre of the lake were performed to reconstruct the interrelation between lake hydrology and climate variability of the last 11,000 yr. Principal component analyses (PCA) analyses enabled us to extract the three system variables runoff, lake level/water budget and salinity as the major factors which have influenced the lake history during a highly variable Holocene climate. We can also demonstrate that the independent variable total organic carbon (TOC) is not only a function of bio-productivity in lakes under warm-wet climate conditions but more frequently related to surface runoff processes, which can result in over-estimation of pollen types used for climate reconstructions. A combined consideration of all system variables with lithological parameters, catchment characteristics and the local groundwater situation show that lake formation and its persistence strongly depended on local rainfall/runoff and the status of the underlying aquifer. Our results indicate remarkable differences between the early Holocene and mid to late Holocene lake formation, owing to changes in the aquifer system beneath the lake. At about 10,700 cal BP freshwater lake formation starts with extreme runoff events under a wet climate. Repeated dry climate spells of reduced runoff. The overall climate during the early Holocene points to wet conditions with frequent phases of very high runoff and highest lake levels until about 8900 cal BP. Extremely low runoff occurred between 8900 and 8100 cal BP, indicating already dry climate conditions some hundred years prior to the worldwide recorded responses of the 8.2 ka cold-dry event. A second period of major dry climate conditions with generally low but fluctuating runoff, unstable water budget and deposition of aeolian sand lasted for about 2100yr between 7500 and 5400 cal BP. These climate conditions corroborate previous assumptions of a mid Holocene dry period in and north-western China. Increased runoff after 5400 cal BP under wet climate conditions led to a complete refill of the aquifer at about 5000 cal BP and favoured the development of a saline lake for about 3500 yr. In terms of hydrology the time between 5400 and 4000 cal BP appears to be the climate optimum. Compared with the early Holocene wet climate, the mid to late Holocene local rainfall was less pronounced and displays a general decreasing trend towards complete desiccation of the lake. Our results indicate an extremely variable moisture availability in and regions of north-western China during the entire Holocene. Owing to the interplay of the East Asian Summer Monsoon with the westerly waves at the boundary of the summer monsoon limit, variations from dry to wet climate conditions seem to have been more pronounced than in other monsoon regions of China.

Vertical distribution and feeding activity of Epischura baicalensis Sars (Copepoda) nauplii in response to two predators in Lake Baikal in winter	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												In March 1999 and 2000, we carried out synchronous observations for species representing the entire pelagic food web in lake Baikal: picoplankton, phytoplankton, copepods (Epischura baicalensis), amphipods (Macrohectopus branickii) and sculpin larvae (Comephoridae). During daytime, the layer with the maximal density of Epischura nauplii coincided with the maximal distribution of pico- and phytoplankton in the 0-15 m layer. In this layer, 60-70% of the nauplii were feeding. The diurnal distribution of Epischura nauplii coincided with that of fish larvae, that feed intensively on Epischura nauplii during daytime, but did not overlap with the second predator, the amphipod Macrohectopus. At night, the decrease of feeding activity and the descent of the maximal distribution of nauplii coincided with the ascent of Macrohectopus to upper layers. We propose, that the Epischura nauplii respond to the threat from the invertebrate predator with anti-predation behaviour (reduced feeding and dispersal/descent), while the threat from fish larvae during day is ignored, probably because of the low of fish larval density.

J	Jones, MB; Humphries, SW				Jones, MB; Humphries, SW			Impacts of the C4 sedge Cyperus papyrus L. on carbon and water fluxes in an African wetland	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Fluxes of CO2 and H2O vapour were measured by eddy covariance from a stand of the C-4 emergent sedge Cyperus papyrus ( papyrus), which formed a fringing swamp on the north- west shore of Lake Naivasha, Kenya. The fluxes of CO2 and H2O vapour between the papyrus swamp and the atmosphere were large but variable, depending on the hydrology of the wetland system and the condition of the vegetation. These measurements, combined with simulation modelling of annual fluxes of CO2, show that papyrus swamps have the potential to sequester large amounts of the carbon (similar to 1.6 kg C m(-2) y(-1)) when detritus accumulates under water in anaerobic conditions, but they are a net source of carbon release to the atmosphere (similar to 1.0 kg C m(-2) y(-1)) when water levels fall to expose detritus and rhizomes to aerobic conditions. Evapotranspiration from papyrus swamps ( E) was frequently lower than evaporation from open water surfaces ( E-o) and plant factors have a strong influence on the flux of water to the atmosphere. For the period of measurement E/E-o was 0.36.																			0018-8158					NOV	2002	488	1-3					107	113		10.1023/A:1023370329097	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1023370329097													WOS:000182300700010

Underway measurement of cyanobacterial microcystins using a surface plasmon resonance sensor on an autonomous underwater vehicle	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												Freshwater cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CHABs) are a well-known global public health threat. Monitoring and early detection of CHAB toxins are currently accomplished using labor-intensive sampling techniques and subsequent shore-based analyses, with results typically reported 24-48 h after sample collection. We have developed and implemented an uncrewed, autonomous mobile sampler-analytical system capable of conducting targeted in situ toxin measurements in < 2 h. A surface plasmon resonance (SPR) instrument was combined with the environmental sample processor (ESP) to fully automate detection and quantification of particle-associated cyanobacterial microcystins (pMC). This sensor-sampler system was integrated with a long-range autonomous underwater vehicle (LRAUV) and deployed in western Lake Erie for field trials in the summer of 2021. The LRAUV was remotely piloted to acquire samples at selected locations within and adjacent to a CHAB. Sixteen pMC measurements ranging from 0.09 to 0.55 mu g/L lake water were obtained over a 14-day period without recovery of the LRAUV. The SPR/ESP/LRAUV system complements existing satellite, aerial, and manual sampling CHAB survey techniques, and could be used to enhance predictive models that underpin bloom and toxicity forecasts. This system is also extensible to detection of other algal toxins in freshwater and marine environments, with its near real-time assessment of bloom toxin levels potentially offering additional socioeconomic benefits and public health protection in a variety of settings.					; Doucette, Gregory/M-3283-2013; Goodwin, Kelly/B-4985-2014	Preston, Christina/0000-0003-0373-1899; Yamahara, Kevan/0000-0003-3344-0283; Ussler, William/0000-0003-2350-4431; Mikulski, Christina/0009-0008-1893-6559													1541-5856					SEP	2024	22	9					681	699		10.1002/lom3.10627	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lom3.10627		JUN 2024						40290351					WOS:001246445100001

In Iran, the current study selected the watersheds of two rivers, Nazloo-Chay and Aji-Chay, to systematically investigate the implications and causes of vegetation cover variations under changing environments. These two rivers are among the essential inflows to Lake Urmia, the second largest saline lake on Earth, and are located on the west and east sides of the lake, respectively. There has been a debate between the people living in the rivers' watersheds about who is responsible for the decline in the level of Lake Urmia-does responsibility fall with those on the east side or with those on the west side? In this study, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used as a remotely sensed index to study spatial-temporal pattern changes in vegetation. Moreover, the temperature, precipitation, and streamflow time series were gathered using ground measurements to explore the causes and implications of changing vegetation cover. Discrete wavelet transform was applied to separate the different components of the time series. The Mann-Kendall (MK) test was applied to the time series on monthly, seasonal, and annual time scales. The connections and relationship between the NDVI time series and temperature, precipitation, and streamflow time series and any underlying causes were investigated using wavelet transform coherence (WTC). Land use maps were generated for different years using a support vector machine (SVM) in the final stage. The results indicated that the most dominant monthly, seasonal, and annual hydrological periodicities across the watersheds are 8 months, 6 months, and 2 years, respectively. The increasing vegetation cover during stable hydro-environmental periods revealed unusual conditions in the Aji-Chay watershed and reflected agricultural expansion. The WTC graphs indicated sudden changes in mutual periodicities and time-lags with different patterns between variables, which indicates the increasing anthropogenic activities in both watersheds. However, this was more dominant in the Aji-Chay watershed. The land use maps and investigation of the averaged NDVI maps also denoted that the areas of cultivated land have increased by 30% in the Aji-Chay watershed, and crop types have been changed to the crops with a higher demand for water in both watersheds.					; Foroumandi, Ehsan/CAH-3797-2022; Nourani, Vahid/F-4051-2017	Foroumandi, Ehsan/0000-0001-6867-7550; Dabrowska, Dominika/0000-0002-6762-8885; KANTOUSH, Sameh Ahmed/0000-0003-0919-5097														2073-445X				JAN	2022	11	1							115	10.3390/land11010115	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11010115													WOS:000756483800001
J	Chen, Y; Zhai, PM				Chen, Yang; Zhai, Panmao			Two types of typical circulation pattern for persistent extreme precipitation in Central-Eastern China	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												Two characteristic circulation patterns responsible for persistent extreme precipitation (PEP) events in Central-Eastern China are identified using a composite analysis: a double-blocking high type and a single-blocking high type. The double-blocking high type is characterized by the development of two blocking highs near the Ural Mountains and the Sea of Okhotsk, with a trough between them. This long-lived pattern continuously steers cold/dry air from mid-high latitudes to Central-Eastern China, where it encounters anomalously warm/moist air from lower latitudes conveyed by intensified southeasterlies associated with a westward shift of the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH). The single-blocking high type is characterized by the appearance of a blocking high to the south of Lake Baikal. This blocking high is accompanied by a deep trough located to its east, which extends into the southern Yangtze River Valley. The anomalous anticyclone associated with the westward extension of the WPSH is located further south and slightly east of that observed during the double-blocking high type. Accordingly, the intensified southeasterlies convey anomalously moist air to the southern and eastern parts of Central-Eastern China. In the upper troposphere, the displacement of the South Asian High and jets favours divergence for both typical circulation patterns. The comparison between the composites and additional cases that share similar circulation patterns but do not result in PEP in Central-Eastern China suggests that PEP events typically result from concurrent combinations of persistent anomalies from lower to upper levels, rather than from isolated anomalies of specific weather systems.

J	Il'inskaya, NB; Petrova, NA; Matena, I				Il'inskaya, NB; Petrova, NA; Matena, I			The relationship between the level of inversion polymorphism and the type of water body, the season, and the year of observation in Chironomus plumosus L. (Diptera, Chironomidae)	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS												Data on chromosomal polymorphism in 50 natural populations of Chironomus plumosus from ecologically different European and Asian water bodies were summarized. To estimate the inversion polymorphism, two indices were used: the percentage of individuals heterozygous for inversions among the total number of individuals in a given sample and the mean number of heterozygous states for inversions per individual. The association between the level of polymorphism and the type of water body was studied. Water bodies were divided into four groups: ponds, lakes, reservoirs, and flood plains. Statistically significant differences in both polymorphism indices were found between populations from two types of water bodies: lakes and reservoirs. In turn, the populations from ponds fell into two groups: western- and eastern-European. Statistically significant differences in the level of polymorphism were also observed between these two groups. Moreover, the populations from eastern-European ponds (Russia) and reservoirs are comparable to the populations from the ponds of western Europe (Czech Republic) and lakes in the level of polymorphism. Seasonal variation for heterozygosity was found only in the lake populations. Long-term (3- to 19-year) studies by different authors on more than ten populations from the ponds and reservoirs that are distant from one another revealed annual stability (with slight fluctuations) of the polymorphism level. An analysis of the temporal ecological regularities of the maintenance of inversion polymorphism in C. plumosus also revealed surprisingly stable dynamics: the level of polymorphism was significant throughout the species range, but it varied among populations and depended on ecological conditions (type of water body, season, etc.).

However, the detailed formation mechanism of HCHO pollution remains unclear. Based on a comprehensive field campaign conducted at Dianshan Lake (DSL) station, a supersite located in the suburban YRD region, the influence of VOCs on HCHO formation, as well as the role of HCHO in the ROx radical recycling was analyzed. Results indicate that the maximum atmospheric oxidation capability (AOC) during HCHO pollution episodes varies from 0.65 x 108 to 1.29 x 108 molecules cm-3 s- 1, and high AOC value favors the secondary formation of HCHO. Meanwhile, the photolysis of HCHO accounts for 21.2% of the primary ROx, suggesting the significant role of HCHO in ROx recycling. Isoprene was identified to be a key precursor of HCHO, and the RO from isoprene contributed ~15% to the total daytime HCHO production rate (PHCHO). Sensitivity analysis reveal that when isoprene, xylene or ethylene was cut off, the simulated HCHO concentration could be reduced by 50%, 15%, or 13%, respectively. Based on the isopleth of HCHO under different VOCs/NOx reduction ratios, we found that the VOCs/NOx reduction ratio should be above 1.03 to mitigate the HCHO pollution. Reactive VOCs (such as isoprene, xylene and alkenes) should be reduced to suppress HCHO pollution in the YRD region.					; Li, Li/AAE-9874-2021; Wang, Yuhang/B-5578-2014; Zhang, Kun/AFK-4020-2022	Zhang, Kun/0000-0003-1636-5373; Li, Li/0000-0001-5575-0894; , Yuhang/0000-0002-7290-2551; Huo, Juntao/0000-0002-6067-0749													1352-2310	1873-2844				DEC 15	2021	267								118755	10.1016/j.atmosenv.2021.118755	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2021.118755		OCT 2021											WOS:000709713300001

Endozoochory of aquatic ferns and angiosperms by mallards in Central Europe	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. Modern literature on plant dispersal by birds focuses mainly on the importance of frugivory and scatter-hoarding, yet recent studies show that endozoochory by migratory waterbirds is an important mechanism of long-distance dispersal for a broad range of plants. Nevertheless, there is a lack of empirical field studies that identify the plants dispersed by waterbirds in a comprehensive manner. In particular, so far there are no detailed studies of the level of spatial variation in the plant taxa dispersed by a waterbird vector, and no clear demonstration that aquatic ferns can be dispersed by endozoochory. Consequently, we remain ignorant of the networks of dispersal interactions between granivorous waterbirds and plants. 2. Five sets of faecal samples (total n=215) were collected from mallards Anas platyrhynchos on autumn migration in the Hevesi-holm and Balaton regions in Hungary, central Europe. Intact diaspores were extracted, identified and their germinability assessed under standard conditions. The plant communities recorded at different sites were compared with PERMANOVA and other multivariate methods. 3. Macrospores of the floating watermoss Salvinia natans were recorded in 32 samples, and a total of 16 macrospores germinated, providing the first field demonstration of endozoochory of ferns by birds. Of 21 angiosperm taxa recorded (of which eight germinated), 13 were terrestrial species, although the most abundant taxa were aquatic species such as the alkali bulrush Bolboschoenus maritimus and the sago pondweed Potamogeton pectinatus. Two naturalized alien species, the common fig Ficus carica and the hackberry Celtis occidentalis were also recorded. Only four of the taxa had an endozoochory syndrome. The plant taxa dispersed varied at two different spatial scales, with minor but significant differences between samples from sites separated by less than 1km, and major differences between the two regions separated by c. 220km. 4. Synthesis. This is a unique study of the spatial variation in plants dispersed by endozoochory by a migratory waterfowl species, with a high taxonomic resolution and the first demonstration of avian endozoochory of ferns. We recorded eight taxa not previously reported as dispersed by mallards, showing how more empirical studies are essential, so we can understand which plants are dispersed by migratory birds. We found evidence that networks of interactions between granivorous waterbird vectors and dispersed plants vary spatially.					; vincze, orsolya/AEQ-1159-2022; Green, Andy/A-5189-2008; Lovas-Kiss, Ádám/J-3746-2019	Lovas-Kiss, Adam/0000-0002-8811-1623; Vincze, Orsolya/0000-0001-5789-2124; 													0022-0477	1365-2745				JUL	2018	106	4					1714	1723		10.1111/1365-2745.12913	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.12913													WOS:000435444700031

Imperiled Great Basin terminal lakes: Synthesizing ecological and hydrological science gaps and research needs for waterbird conservation	BIOSCIENCE												Terminal lakes are declining globally because of human water demands, drought, and climate change. Through literature synthesis and feedback from the resource and conservation community, we review the state of research for terminal lakes in the Great Basin of the United States, which support millions of waterbirds annually, to prioritize ecological and hydrologic information needs. From an ecological perspective, research priorities include measuring the underlying differences in waterbird resource selection and distribution, migratory connectivity, abiotic factors that interact with prey densities to affect prey availability, and waterbird fitness or demography. Integrated links between water availability, water quality, and food webs are lacking in the literature. Scarce water availability data hinder the current knowledge of water extraction and evapotranspiration rates. Research that can address these priorities would help advance our understanding of how the Great Basin terminal lakes function as an interrelated system and support conservation efforts to reverse the decline of these critical lakes.

Mitigating these adverse effects through effective algal bloom management requires identifying the contributing factors and predicting algal concentrations. This study focused on the upstream region of the Seungchon Weir in Korea, which is characterized by elevated levels of total nitrogen and phosphorus due to a significant influx of water from a sewage treatment plant. We employed four distinct machine learning models to predict chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations and identified the influential variables linked to local algal bloom events. The gradient boosting model enabled an in-depth exploration of the intricate relationships between algal occurrence and water quality parameters, enabling accurate identification of the causal factors. The models identified the discharge flow rate (D-Flow) and water temperature as the primary determinants of Chl-a levels, with feature importance values of 0.236 and 0.212, respectively. Enhanced model precision was achieved by utilizing daily average D-Flow values, with model accuracy and significance of the D-Flow amplifying as the temporal span of daily averaging increased. Elevated Chl-a concentrations correlated with diminished D-Flow and temperature, highlighting the pivotal role of D-Flow in regulating Chl-a concentration. This trend can be attributed to the constrained discharge of the Seungchon Weir during winter. Calculating the requisite D-Flow to maintain a desirable Chl-a concentration of up to 20 mg/m 3 across varying temperatures revealed an escalating demand for D-Flow with rising temperatures. Specific D-Flow ranges, corresponding to each season and temperature condition, were identified as particularly influential on Chl-a concentration. Thus, optimizing Chl-a reduction can be achieved by strategically increasing D-Flow within these specified ranges for each season and temperature variation. This study highlights the importance of maintaining sufficient D-Flow levels to mitigate algal proliferation within river systems featuring weirs.					; Park, Seong-Jik/JDN-3009-2023	Lee, Chang-Gu/0000-0002-2304-8635; Park, Seong-Jik/0000-0003-2122-5498; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				MAR	2024	355								120551	10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.120551	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.120551		MAR 2024						38460331					WOS:001218796300001
J	Svistunov, VM				Svistunov, Vyacheslav M.			The uprising of Karasakal 1740 (according to the documents of G.F. Miller)	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY												The description of the 1740 Bashkir uprising is firstly stated in this article. Its chronology is traced in the archival case identified in the RGADA. The proclamation of Karasakal as his khan by the Bashkirs in January 1740, ended that all the promises he had previously made on behalf of the empress lost their strength and untied hands to her Cabinet to carry out fierce measures to suppress the uprising. The commanders of the tsarist troops ordered the start of military operations. The fiercest battles took place between the rebelled Bashkirs and the royal troops in the Urals. Determined actions of the detachment of Lieutenant Colonel Pavlutsky and his allies from the faithful Bashkirs and Meshcheryaks played a key role. It was their pursuit of the Karasakal detachment in the spring of 1740 that decapitated the uprising at the beginning. The summer final campaign for the capture of the khan began on May 24, 1740. The fight, which predetermined the subsequent course of events, took place on the night of 25 to 26 May, 1740 at the lake Chebarkul. Using field artillery, Pavlutsky's team managed to push the main forces of Karasakal into the Ural Mountains. The Bashkir rebels, with their families and cattle, convinced that their gathering place had been discovered, began a clandestine movement to the Yaik River to join Karasakal. The new khan himself and his encirclement went away to Yaik unencumbered, securing the freedom of maneuver. After the fight at the Yaik river crossing with the rearguard of Karasakal, Pavlutsky crossed to the left bank, continued to pursue the khan. But he moved very quickly, leaving the chase. He was assisted by Bashkir detachments, which imposed rearguard fights on the pursuers at crossings. When Pavlutsky's detachment approached Tobol, there was no khan on the left bank, as he crossed the river the day before Pavlutsky's arrival, that's how long Pavlutsky spent crossing the Yaik. Karasakal also left the persecution and went to the adjacent territory of the Kyrgyz-Kaisakov. Then Lieutenant Colonel Pavlutsky, having stopped the chase, returned to the Verkhneeyitskaya fortress, where Colonel Arsenyev was preparing the final stage of the military-punitive operation. Three punitive parties with a total number of 2888 people completely devastated and burned down the rebellious Bashkir volosts. When P.D. Aksakov took up the post of vice-governor of the Ufa province in October 1741, he was struck by the scale of the damage. Using the powers given to him, Aksakov investigated the most high-profile cases, trying to give them criminal nature. His activity caused an open confrontation by L.Ya. Soymonov and I.I. Neplyuev. According to R.G. Ignatiev, a new kind of Bashkir rebellion began, but this time "in paper". The final result of this skirmish was the victory of the point of view of Soymonov-Neplyuev on the Bashkir problem, which consisted in the implementation of a towards the Bashkirs, but with the solution of the land issue in their favor.																			1998-8613	2311-2387					2024		89								10.17223/19988613/89/18	http://dx.doi.org/10.17223/19988613/89/18													WOS:001304429100018

Spatial variability and temporal dynamics of cyanobacteria blooms and water quality parameters in Missisquoi Bay (Lake Champlain)	WATER SUPPLY												Cyanobacteria bloom events have been associated with eutrophication processes, along with hydrologic and climate factors. Missisquoi Bay is a portion of Lake Champlain (USA-Canada) that is highly eutrophic and prone to cyanobacteria blooms and cyanotoxins. This study assessed the spatial-temporal influence of nutrients, turbidity and temperature in cyanobacteria distributions during a bloom event in the summer of 2006. Correlations, generalized linear models (GLMs), geostatistics and local indications of spatial association (LISA) autocorrelation analysis tested the influence of nutrient and non-nutrient explanatory variables in cyanobacteria biovolume. Total phosphorus exhibited a high direct correlation with cyanobacteria biovolume. The best performing GLMs included total phosphorus, total nitrogen, Secchi depth (as turbidity) and temperature as explanatory variables of cyanobacteria biovolume. Variogram analysis of those variables resulted in a better understanding of the underlying spatial variation process of the cyanobacteria bloom event. The LISA test revealed a moderate but stable autocorrelation between cyanobacteria biovolume and total phosphorus from 180 to 1,000 m of weight distance, suggesting the possibility of up-scaling the current results to coarse-resolution satellite imagery for more frequent monitoring of bloom events. The LISA test also revealed the spatial-temporal dynamic (movement of cyanobacteria scums) of high cyanobacteria blooms with high total phosphorus concentration.

Emissions reduction benefits of siting an offshore wind farm: A temporal and spatial analysis of Lake Michigan	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS												Siting decisions of offshore wind farms influence the magnitude of emissions reduction benefits. This paper calculates electricity generation and emissions reduction of CO2, NOx, and SO2, and values these reductions to determine the impact of the siting location for a 300 MW offshore wind farm in Lake Michigan. The most important patterns for emissions reduction were the monthly trends, where January, March, and December consistently had the highest electricity generation and emissions reduction benefits. Summer months such as July and August had the lowest emissions reduction benefits. The intra-day trends showed higher emissions reduction benefits during off-peak hours, due to a higher likelihood of coal units being the marginal generator. These diurnal differences were smaller in magnitude than the seasonal differences. Two benefit valuation scenarios were analyzed for a 20-year time period, one using marginal damages of pollution and another using market prices for pollution allowances. The first scenario resulted in emissions reduction benefits ranging from $1827/kW to $2690/kW ($2508/kW averaged) throughout the Lake Michigan region for the 20-year period (applying a 3% discount rate). This equates to approximately $33/MWh in all lake locations since the emissions reduction benefits are primarily a function of electricity generation. The market price scenario resulted in a much lower range of $820/kW to $1060/kW ($987/kW average or 39% of the pollution damage costs). In scenario 1, the major component of emissions reduction benefits was CO2 reduction (86% of benefits), and 83% of these CO2 benefits were from offsetting coal plant emissions. A sensitivity analysis on size and region of emission reduction location showed that the NO and SO2 benefits vary significantly (unlike CO2 benefits), but this variation had minimal effects on the total emissions reduction benefits. In comparison with economic investment costs, the scenario 1 emissions reduction benefits equal 49% of the total investment cost (in 2014 $million) on average. Spatial maps and heat maps are generated to illustrate the spatial and temporal variations in the emissions reduction benefits. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This structural unit includes folds, thrusts, strike-slip faults and salt diapirs. There is evidence of past failures in the area, probably some 11,000 years ago. In the order of 30 million cubic metres of rock debris was moved from the Kabir Kuh Anticline as well as rock failures from the Ravandi Anticline. Investigations indicated 4.5 m of landslide/rock fall debris underlying about 28 m of lake deposits and 5.5 m of recent river alluvium upstream of the Seymareh Dam area. The direction of the Seymareh River bed was displaced by about 1,000 m to the northeast, forming a sharp river meander near the entrance to the gorge of the Ravandi Anticline where the Seymareh Dam is being constructed. The paper reports the rock slope instability modelling, kinematic analysis of slope faces and landslide hazard zoning undertaken.

Systematically variable planktonic carbon metabolism along a land-to-lake gradient in a Great Lakes coastal zone	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												During the summers of 2002-2013, we measured rates of carbon metabolism in surface waters of six sites across a land-to-lake gradient from the upstream end of drowned river-mouth Muskegon Lake (ML) (freshwater estuary) to 19 km offshore in Lake Michigan (LM) (a Great Lake). Despite considerable inter-year variability, the average rates of gross production (GP), respiration (R) and net production (NP) across ML (604+/- 58, 222+/- 22 and 381+/- 52 mu g C L-1 day(-1), respectively) decreased steeply in the furthest offshore LM site (22+/- 3, 55+/- 17 and 233+/- 15 mu g C L-1 day(-1), respectively). Along this land-to-lake gradient, GP decreased by 96+/- 1%, whereas R only decreased by 75+/- 9%, variably influencing the carbon balance along this coastal zone. All ML sites were consistently net autotrophic (mean GP: R = 2.7), while the furthest offshore LM site was net heterotrophic (mean GP: R = 0.4). Our study suggests that pelagic waters of this Great Lakes coastal estuary are net carbon sinks that transition into net carbon sources offshore. Reactive and dynamic estuarine coastal zones everywhere may contribute similarly to regional and global carbon cycles.

J	Guo, NC; Xie, P				Guo, Nichun; Xie, Ping			A study on the effects of food quantity and quality on glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity and growth rate parameters of Daphnia carinata varying in age	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												The adverse influences of insufficient food and toxins on Daphnia carinata's body growth, reproduction and tolerance were investigated in the laboratory. Different concentrations of Scendesmus obliquus and a mixture of S. obliquus and microcystin (MC)-containing Microcystis aeruginosa PCC7820 were used to feed D. carinata. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity towards five chemical compounds (substrates) was measured and used as an indicator of their tolerance. Body growth rate and clutch size of D. carinata decreased with declined concentration or decreased proportion of S. obliquus in the diet. GST activity decreased with ageing in D. carinata. However, GST activity to several chemical compounds increased when food quantity or food quality decreased. Adult D. carinata had a lower GST activity towards p-nitrophenenzyl chloride (PNBC) than juveniles and exhibited a sharp decline (P < 0.001) in GST activity towards PNBC as the animals aged. It is suggested that the age-specific decrease in GST activity is a possible mechanism for the high morality of adult D. carinata in the summer of eutrophic lakes.

Evidence is presented to support the hypothesis that S. bleekeri breeds in specific parts of the lake and that spawning takes place between September and December following a southward migration of reproductively active fish. The data suggest that S. bleekeri is able to vary its reproductive strategy. Under normal circumstances, the species migrates from the system to spawn at sea during winter along with other marine fish species which spend part of their life cycle in estuaries. However, when conditions within the lake are suitable, a part of the population will remain and breed there. Recruitment of S. bleekeri into the St Lucia estuarine system takes place from the muddy offshore marine banks, probably via surf zone nursery areas, as well as from within the system. There are indications that, in some years, post-spawners move back up the lake en masse, whereas in other years there is simply a gradual movement of fish.																			0257-7615						1991	10						45	51																WOS:A1991GP22400005

Centennial climate variability in the British Isles during the mid-late Holocene	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS					Annual Discussion Meeting of the Quaternary-Research-Association	JAN 08-10, 2008	ENGLAND	Quaternary Res Assoc				Multi-millennial climate changes were relatively minor over the mid-late Holocene in the British Isles, because orbitally forced insolation changes were smaller than those at higher latitudes. Centennial climate variability is thus likely to have exerted a greater influence on the environment and human society of the region. Proxy-climate records from the British Isles covering the last 4500 years are assembled and re-evaluated with the aim of identifying centennial climate variability reflected by multiproxy indicators. The proxies include bog oak populations, peatland surface wetness, flooding episodes from fluvial deposits, speleothem annual band width and oxygen isotopes, chironomids from lake sediments and sand and dune deposition. Most proxies reflect water balance rather than temperature alone, and records predominantly reflect warm season climate. A series of 12 key periods of enhanced precipitation-evaporation (P-E) are identified by their presence in two or more proxy records. Variability in P-E is much greater than that shown by temperature proxies and there is no necessary association between warm/cool and dry/wet periods. Although the data for temperature are less robust than those for P-E, a series of key temperature changes are proposed based on speleothem delta O-18 and chironomid inferred July temperature records, relatively cool before c. 3100 years BP, warmer (3100-2000 years BP), cool (2000-1250 cal years BP), warm (1250-650 cal years BP), and cool (650 cal years BP onwards). Some key increases in P-E (2750, 1650, 550 cal years BP) show a strong correspondence with 'Bond cycles' in ocean proxy records for increased ice rafted debris, decreased summer sea surface temperatures and sometimes decreased North Atlantic deep water circulation Other higher frequency changes in P-E are also strongly related to SST variability Whilst some of the main changes to cooler SSTs and increased P-E are approximately coincident with reduced solar output, most are not and thus must be the result of the internal dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere. Future work should concentrate on firmly establishing the pattern of temperature change, improving chronological accuracy and precision in existing records and improving process-based understanding of proxies.

J	ANDERSON, RY				ANDERSON, RY			POSSIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN SURFACE WINDS, SOLAR-ACTIVITY AND THE EARTHS MAGNETIC-FIELD	NATURE												RECORDS of C-14 in tree rings provide a proxy for changes in solar activity on timescales of decades to centuries 1-2. Here I report an association between Maunder-type solar cycles recorded in tree rings and fluctuations in surface wind intensity on a roughly 200-year timescale over a period of about 2,000 years in the mid-Holocene. The wind record is preserved as changes in the thickness of varved sediments in Elk Lake, Minnesota, which contain a large aeolian component. Changes in cyclonic activity and tropospheric winds have been reported 3-5 to occur in this region a few days after strong coronal mass ejections (CMEs); increases of up to 7% in zonal flow have been reported 5 at an altitude of approximately 300 m after strong CMEs in winter. The implication of this association is that century-scale changes in surface winds over Minnesota were the long-term (Maunder-scale) counterpart of short-term (daily) changes in winds after CMEs. The weak magnetic field strength of the Earth at this time 6,7 might be relevant to a possible mechanism for the association.																			0028-0836					JUL 2	1992	358	6381					51	53		10.1038/358051a0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/358051a0													WOS:A1992JB34100049
J	Dai, LX; Fan, XM; Jansen, JD; Xu, Q				Dai, Lanxin; Fan, Xuanmei; Jansen, John D.; Xu, Qiang			Landslides and fluvial response to landsliding induced by the 1933 Diexi earthquake, Minjiang River, eastern Tibetan Plateau	LANDSLIDES												On 25 August 1933, a 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau in Sichuan, China. The Diexi earthquake is among the largest known geohazard events worldwide and is frequently cited by those studying the effects of large earthquakes. And yet, the attention focused on this event has failed to deliver a clear picture of landslides and their geomorphic impacts-key attributes of the Diexi earthquake and its aftermath remain obscure and debated. By integrating present-day LiDAR topographic data with existing records (including studies published in Chinese), and a series of unique archival photographs (from 1910, 1920, and 1934), we present the first inventory of coseismic landslides from the epicentral region of this catastrophic 1933 event. We find that the earthquake-triggered landslides were mainly of shallow to deep rock/debris fall/avalanche type, containing mass detached from steep slopes at the top of the mountain ridge source. We reinterpreted three major landslide dams on the Minjiang River based on their geomorphology and sedimentology, and we reconstructed the processes of impoundment and the maximum area of the dammed lake that breached 45 days after the earthquake. Since 1933, we estimate that 43.15-47.68 million m(3) of post-earthquake sediment has been delivered to valley floors from the erosion of the three landslide dams, with a sediment yield of up to 131.71 t km(-2) year(-1). Retrospective studies of the effects of historical earthquakes are challenging, but long-term observations like these are the cornerstone of emerging knowledge of earthquake-induced landsliding and related landscape response.

In vitro experiments showed that Cladophora samples were physically and biologically degraded when subjected to TiO2-mediated photocatalysis. For the most successful photocatalytic process, TiO2 was immobilized on a glass surface and used in combination with either sunlight or artificial UV light. The loss of vital algal pigments was monitored using UV-vis spectrophotometry, and cell structural changes were determined by microscopic observation. Cladophora, in the presence of TiO2-covered glass beads, experienced a. loss of chloroplast pigments after 2 h of UV lamp light irradiation. In a separate experiment, sunlight exposure over 4 days (similar to 24 h) resulted in the complete oxidative degradation of the green chloroplast pigments, verified by the UV spectra of the algal extracts. These results suggest that TiO2, mobilized on sunlit silicates may be useful in controlling growth and survival of this alga in the Great Lakes, thus mitigating many of the economic, aesthetic ecological impacts of this invasive alga.

J	Lozano, HK				Lozano, Henry Knight			Water in Paradise: California, Florida, and Environmental Rivalry in the Gilded Age	ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY												Focusing on the writings of state and local promoters, this article traces how water-based characteristics formed a fundamental differential in the rivalry between California and Florida for settlers and tourists in the Gilded Age. In crude terms California and Florida presented as environmental opposites: while the Pacific state-its southern part, especially-was associated with a scarcity of water, Florida, with its many rivers, lakes, springs, and swamps, appeared to host a troubling abundance of the stuff. An important element of truth underpinned these conceptions. But in their competition to sell their states as "paradises" for Americans, land and tourism boosters accentuated this environmental dichotomy and its potential developmental consequences. "Dry" California was set against "watery" Florida as promoters repeatedly attacked the other's supposed environmental deficiencies. Ultimately, while both states succeeded in becoming leading tourist destinations, Southern California's proponents seemed to hold the upper hand over their Florida counterparts in selling an American homeland. Their championing of irrigation as a "civilizing" process that converted desert into prosperous garden soothed widespread anxieties over living in such an arid land and contrasted with the persistent struggles of Florida's advocates to convince Americans to relocate permanently to the supposedly water-logged peninsula.																			1084-5453	1930-8892				OCT	2015	20	4					619	644		10.1093/envhis/emv100	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/envhis/emv100													WOS:000362965800003

The curve is based on a series of AMS 14C dates on terrestrial plant macrofossils across the isolation level in each of five lakes located between 3.5 and 74.5 m a.s.l. During the first 1200 years, the RSL fell very rapidly from the marine limit at 98 m a.s.l. to 33 m a.s.l., i.e. at a rate of 5.4 cm yr-1. The emergence rate then slowed considerably and was close to standstill 8000-6500 cal. yr BP. However, an emergence of 16.5 m has taken place during the past 6000 years. Radiocarbon dates of terrestrial plant macrofossils from the basal strata in a lake above the marine limit and mollusc shells from glaciomarine silt in the isolation basins yielded a mean age for the local ice-margin retreat of 11 300 cal. yr BP. This verifies that Hardangerfjorden was glaciated during the Younger Dryas - an interpretation that has recently been disputed. The ice margin retreated at a rate of about 300 m yr-1 from the position of the Younger Dryas moraine to this site some 60 km further into the fjord.

J	Ju, JC; Roy, DP				Ju, Junchang; Roy, David P.			The availability of cloud-free Landsat ETM plus data over the conterminous United States and globally	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The U.S. Landsat satellite series provide the longest dedicated land remote sensing data record with a balance between requirements for localized high spatial resolution studies and global monitoring. As with any other optical wavelength satellite sensor, cloud contamination greatly compromises image usability for land surface studies. Additionally, selective scene acquisition due to payload, ground station and mission cost constraints further reduces Landsat image availability. Since the 1999 launch of the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) a Longterm Acquisition Plan (LTAP) has been used to anticipate user requests with the goal of annually refreshing a global daytime archive of cloud-free ETM+ data. This research evaluates the availability of cloud-free Landsat ETM+ data over the conterminous U.S. and globally using 3 years of ETM+ cloud fraction metadata archived by the U.S. Landsat project. Landsat application requirements including obtaining at least one cloud-free observation in a year, a season, and two different seasons, or at least a pair of cloud-free observations occurring no more than 16, 32, 48, 64, and 80 days apart within a year and season are considered. Probabilistic analyses indicate that over the conterminous U.S., land applications requiring at least one cloud-free observation in a year, a season, two different seasons, or at least two cloud-free observations occurring within any period of the year, are on average largely unaffected by cloud cover, except for certain Winter applications and cloudy scenes near the U. S. Canada border and the Great Lakes. Cloud becomes a constraint when at least two cloud-free observations are required from the same season over the conterminous U.S., especially when the separation between observations is restricted to short time intervals. Global applications requiring at least one cloud-free observation in a season, in two different seasons, and applications requiring at least two cloud-free observations in a year, are all severely affected by cloud and data availability constraints; and globally it is generally not practical to consider land applications that require at least two cloud-free observations in any season. Globally, only land applications requiring at least one cloud-free observation per year are largely unaffected by cloud cover and the reduced global ETM+ data availability. These results are specific only to the U.S. Landsat ETM+ archive; they suggest the need for an increased global Landsat acquisition rate for the current and future Landsat missions and/or the development of new approaches to mitigating cloud contamination in the U.S. global Landsat ETM+ archive.

A Matrice 600 Pro drone was used for remote sampling in the hyperacid crater lake of the Poas volcano, the mildly acidic Lake Botos, and the nearly neutral Lake Hule. A bailer bottle of 250mL and a HOBO temperature probe, mounted on the drone, were deployed using a specially designed delivery retrieval system. A comparison was carried out relating to the geochemistry of lake water collected by drone as opposed to the hand-collected samples. The SO4-2/Cl ratios of the two samples at Poas hyperacid crater lake were similar, (1.1 +/- 0.2) on average, an indication of a lake with homogenous water composition. The Lake Hule showed a similar composition to that registered 20 years ago. The waters from Lake Botos showed some differences, which may be explained by the influence of springs at the bottom of the lake, but the Wilcoxon's signed-rank test showed a good exhibit of a satisfactory level of similarity. Autonomous navigation proves to be very useful for faster, more efficient, reliable, and less hazardous sampling of volcanic lakes.

A total of 141 fish were captured and necropsied, and three standard sections of liver were taken for histological examination. Prevalences of altered hepatocyte foci, hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangioma, and cholangiocarcinoma were 0.7%, 2.1%, 0.7%, and 2.1%, respectively. Thus, the overall prevalence of liver neoplasia was 4.9% (7/141). Hepatic tumors were only observed in fish 7 years old or older. Fish age was significantly and positively correlated with the index assessing the number and size of macrophage aggregates (p<0.001; r(s) = 0.16). Hepatocyte vacuolation, anisokaryosis, lymphocytic infiltration, and bile duct hyperplasia were also observed but were not related to the age, length, sex, or condition factor of the fish.

Alisha			Fungal diversity and function in metagenomes sequenced from extreme environments	FUNGAL ECOLOGY												Fungi are increasingly recognized as key players in various extreme environments. Here we present an analysis of publicly-sourced metagenomes from global extreme environments, focusing on fungal taxonomy and function. The majority of 855 selected metagenomes contained scaffolds assigned to fungi. Relative abundance of fungi was as high as 10% of protein-coding genes with taxonomic annotation, with up to 289 fungal genera per sample. Despite taxonomic clustering by environment, fungal communities were more dissimilar than archaeal and bacterial communities, both for within- and between-environment comparisons. Relatively abundant fungal classes in extreme environments included Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, Leotiomycetes, Pezizomycetes, Saccharomycetes, and Sordariomycetes. Broad generalists and prolific aerial spore formers were the most relatively abundant fungal genera detected in most of the extreme environments, bringing up the question of whether they are actively growing in those environments or just surviving as spores.

S	Ganjoo, RK		Kale, VS		Ganjoo, Rajinder Kumar			The Vale of Kashmir Landform Evolution and Processes	LANDSCAPES AND LANDFORMS OF INDIA	World Geomorphological Landscapes											The Vale of Kashmir is one of the most popular tourist destinations in India. Nestled between the imposing Pir Panjal Range and the towering Karakoram Ranges, the bowl-shaped intermontane valley is studded with numerous freshwater lakes and green meadows. The Jhelum River meanders through the 135 km long valley and exits the oval-shaped basin through a deep gorge near Baramula. The valley preserves a unique landscape known as Karewa. These thick lacustrine and fluvial deposits, capped by loess, form high terrace-like features and cover nearly half the valley. The floodplain of the Jhelum River and the multiple lakes constitute the remaining part of the valley. It is generally agreed that the Kashmir Valley originated from the draining of a huge lake (the Karewa Lake), which was formed as a result of tectonic upheaval and subsequent tectonic uplift of the Pir Panjal and Zanskar Ranges. None of the Karewa deposits provide evidence of glaciers having existed during their deposition within the valley. The uplift of Pir Panj al at 4.5 Ma not only triggered the deposition of Karewa sediments in the valley, but the elevated ranges formed an orographic barrier to the incoming southwest monsoon winds and enhanced the dependence of the valley on winter precipitation.																			2213-2090		978-94-017-8029-2; 978-94-017-8028-5				2014							125	133		10.1007/978-94-017-8029-2_11	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-8029-2_11	10.1007/978-94-017-8029-2												WOS:000357823400013
J	Zalat, AA				Zalat, Abdelfattah A.			Holocene diatom assemblages and their palaeoenvironmental interpretations in Fayoum depression, Western Desert, Egypt	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Diatom assemblages from the diatomaceous deposits of Fayoum depression, Egypt, were analysed to reconstruct the palaeoenvironmental changes during the early to middle Holocene. A total of 283 diatom species and varieties representing 57 genera were identified. The stratigraphic distribution patterns of the recorded diatoms explained eight diatom assemblage zones, which revealed an interesting history of shifts in paleosalinity, pH and water level of the old Fayoum Lake as the water body filled in. Planktonic and benthic-epiphytic assemblages alternate throughout the studied sections. The alternations reflect paleolimnologic conditions as water levels rose and fell. The diatom results have shown four high stands of the freshwater lake level during humid, warmer-wet climatic phases, coinciding with abundance of planktonic Stephanodiscus spp., and Aulacoseira granulata assemblage zones. Rising lake levels are alternated with phases of lowering freshwater lake level with relatively slight rises in salinity and alkalinity. One phase during arid conditions is represented by an abundance of a benthic Navicula radiosa assemblage zone. The second phase during cold and drier climate is dominated by a Staurosira - Staurosirella spp. assemblage zone. The third phase is distinguished by predominance of epiphytic Epithemia spp., Encyonema - Cymbella spp., Synedra spp., and Cocconeis placentula assemblage zones during warm arid conditions.

The concentrations of approximately 80 PCB congeners were determined in 34 samples. The average total PCB concentration was 0.38 ng/m(3) or 7.6 x 10(5) ems. PCB concentrations showed very little change in the past 20 years; statistical analysis of our data and of historical data in the literature indicates that the atmospheric half-life of PCBs is greater than 23 years. The atmospheric residence times for each congener and for each homologue class ranged from 40 to 75 days. Residence times were dependent on the level of chlorination; the more highly chlorinated PCBs had shorter residence times. The fluxes of PCBs from the atmosphere to the earth's surface were 13 mu g m(-2) year(-1). This is comparable to other fluxes found in the literature. Isentropic air trajectories were used to evaluate the importance of different source areas. Concentrations were significantly higher in the summer when the air parcels originate in Africa and the eastern Atlantic.																			0013-936X					NOV	1994	28	12					2001	2007		10.1021/es00061a007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es00061a007								22191738					WOS:A1994PP82900009

Five separate groups of bonobo Pan paniscus were located in the areas of Bolombo-Losombo, Mbala-Donkese, Ngombe-Botuali, Botuali-Ilombe, and Mompulenge-Mbanzi-Malebo-Nguomi, and one population of chimpanzees Pan troglodytes in the Bosobele-Lubengo area. Mean bonobo densities ranged from 0.27 individuals km(-2) in the vicinity of Lake Tumba to 2.2 individuals km(-2) in the Malebo-Nguomi area. In the latter they appear to be living at a higher density than reported for any other site. This may be due to the area's forest-savannah mosaic habitat, which may provide year-round fruit sources, with bonobos falling back on savannah fruits when forest resources are scarce. The bonobos of the Bolombo-Losombo area and the Bosobele-Lubengo chimpanzees have low relative abundances and live in marginal habitats of islands of terra firma within inundated forests.

Allogenic controls on the fluvial architecture and fossil preservation of the Upper Triassic Ischigualasto Formation, NW Argentina	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The Upper Triassic Ischigualasto Formation in NW Argentina was deposited in a fluvial system during the synrift filling of the extensional Ischigualasto-Villa Union Basin. The expansive exposures of the fluvial architecture and paleosols provide a framework to reconstruct the paleoenvironmental evolution of this basin during the Upper Triassic using continental sequence stratigraphy. The Ischigualasto Formation deposition can be divided into seven sequential sedimentary stages: the 1) Bypass stage; 2) Confined low-accommodation stage; 3) Confined high accommodation stage; 4) Unstable-accommodation stage; 5) Unconfined high-accommodation stage; 6) Unconfined low-accommodation stage; and finally, 7) Unconfined high-accommodation stage. The sedimentary evolution of the Ischigualasto Formation was driven by different allogenic controls such as rises and falls in lake levels, local tectonism, subsidence, volcanism, and climate, which also produced modifications of the equilibrium profile of the fluvial systems. All of these factors result in different accommodations in central and flank areas of the basin, which led to different architectural configurations of channels and floodplains. Allogenic processes affected not only the sequence stratigraphy of the basin but also the vertebrate and plant taphocenosis. Therefore, the sequence stratigraphy can be used not only as a predictive tool related to fossil occurrence but also to understand the taphonomic history of the basin at each temporal interval.

J	Venäläinen, A; Frech, M; Heikinheimo, M; Grelle, A				Venäläinen, A; Frech, M; Heikinheimo, M; Grelle, A			Comparison of latent and sensible heat fluxes over boreal lakes with concurrent fluxes over a forest: implications for regional averaging	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												The seasonal and diurnal variation of latent, and sensible, heat fluxes above two boreal-zone lakes and an adjacent coniferous forest was studied using data from the NOPEX field campaigns in 1994 and 1995. Heat fluxes over the lakes were estimated with the bulk aerodynamic method and those over the forest with the eddy-correlation method. The night-time latent heat Aux, while non-existent from the forest, was significant from the lakes during all summer months. The day-time flux from the lakes peaked, on average, in the afternoon, while the maximum flux from the forest occurred around noon. The differences in the latent heat supply between the two surface types varied within +/-(60-80)W m(-2), depending on the month and time of day. The monthly mean latent heat flux from the forest was higher than that from the lakes in May, in June and July the fluxes were about equal; and in August-September, the lake values exceeded those of the forest. The sensible heat Bur reached its maximum values over the forest near noon, but over the lakes during the early morning. An excess supply of heat over the forest of up to 200 W m(-2) was found in comparison with the lakes during the mid-day hours. From May to August, the monthly mean sensible heat flux was higher from the forest than from the lakes. The difference in the heat exchange of lakes and forest was also estimated based from airborne measurements made from an aircraft flying at a height of 100 m. For Right legs consisting of a 15% portion over the lake, the leg-averaged latent heat Aux was, on average, 2% lower and the sensible heat flux 9% lower, compared to a Right leg over fully-forested terrain.

On Variations of the Sound Signal Propagation Time under a Stationary Ice Cover	ACOUSTICAL PHYSICS												In experiments on a stationary acoustic track under a solid ice cover, estimates of possible sound signal propagation time variations at distances of similar to 4 km with a period of more than 100 s were obtained. The experiments were carried out on Lake Baikal in the spring period, when the vertical profile of the sound speed has two sections characteristic of freshwater areas: an upper layer with a near constant sound speed and a lower layer with linear growth of sound speed. Under these conditions, the variations of the propagation time did not exceed similar to 10(-4) s. Numerical modeling showed that the variations of propagation times due to the variability of the medium are minimal for the case when the sound source and receiver are located in the upper layer. It is demonstrated that in this case it is acceptable to take the sound speed in the upper quasi-homogeneous layer as the effective value of the sound speed, which determines the propagation time. The obtained results allowed us to formulate recommendations on under-ice acoustic positioning of autonomous underwater vehicles.

J	Hites, RA; Venier, M				Hites, Ronald A.; Venier, Marta			The Last Paper by Ron Hites. A Tale of Four Cities: Polychlorinated Biphenyls in America	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were designed as stable, nonflammable dielectric fluids, but by the 1960s, they had become a pervasive environmental contaminant. In 1976, a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency report revealed that 600 000 metric tons of PCBs had been produced in the United States by Monsanto, primarily in Anniston, Alabama, and in Sauget, Illinois. Most of this product was used as dielectric fluids in transformers and capacitors manufactured by General Electric (GE) in Hudson Falls and Fort Edward, New York, and by Westinghouse in Bloomington, Indiana. Anniston, Alabama, became highly contaminated with PCBs, leading to considerable regulatory and cleanup issues. PCBs in Sauget, Illinois, received less attention, possibly because of the local government's pro-industrial stance. The upper Hudson River was contaminated with PCBs by GE, and eventually, a billion-dollar cleanup from 2005 to 2015 was implemented. Bloomington, Indiana, home to a Westinghouse plant, also faced PCB issues, but a contentious plan for a PCB incinerator was abandoned due to public opposition. In the end, PCBs in landfills in Bloomington were cleaned up by transporting the contaminated soil to an official hazardous waste disposal landfill. Despite the cleanup of most of these Superfund sites, PCBs remain a ubiquitous environmental problem. PCBs are still present in places where they were not manufactured or used; for example, PCBs are in Great Lakes fish, in the Arctic's atmosphere, and in public buildings, including schools.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				MAY 7	2024	58	18					7683	7690		10.1021/acs.est.4c03535	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c03535								38712349					WOS:001226272800001
J	Glazer, RH; Coppola, E; Giorgi, F				Glazer, Russell H.; Coppola, Erika; Giorgi, Filippo			Understanding Nocturnally Driven Extreme Precipitation Events over Lake Victoria in a Convection-Permitting Model	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Each year, on the order of 1000 fishers are lost on Lake Victoria (LV) due to hazardous weather and intense nighttime thunderstorms making LV one of the most hazardous lakes in the world. In this study, we present a 10-yr (2006-15) convection-permitting (3-km grid spacing) simulation of the LV basin (LVB) using the nonhydrostatic version of RegCM (RegCM-NH). We construct composites of three different types of events over the lake during nighttime and early morning hours: 1) Dry events in which no rain fell over the lake, 2) Normal events in which rainfall over LV matches that of the annual mean, and 3) Extreme events in which rainfall exceeded the 99.99th percentile. In Extreme, an enhanced land breeze takes place along the western side of LV, resulting from convection along the high terrain to the west of the lake in the early evening and nighttime hours which cools the boundary layer through evaporative cooling, cold pools, and prolonged radiatively driven cooling. Cold pools are identified as playing a role in the triggering of convection over the lake and/or the propagation of convection during Extreme events. Greater dynamical forcing in the lead up to an event exists in Extreme relative to Normal, while convective instability over LV is similar in Extreme and Normal. Dry events exhibit hazardous wind conditions over the lake occurring outside the main rainy season.

The suitability of hydroacoustics with gillnetting was evaluated, and the effects of sampling design, effort and statistical analysis on the repeatability of results were tested. Summer hydroacoustic surveys appear appropriate as pollan were not abundant in acoustically unsampled areas. However, pollan density estimates were significantly affected by the gillnet sampling design used to ground-truth the acoustic data. Density estimates from the >12- m layer were more robust to gillnet design than estimates from the 3- to 12- m layer. Estimates from different transect designs yielded some statistically significant results. Comparison of transects common to both transect designs suggests that observed differences reflect temporal changes rather than transect design effects. The reduction in the systematic parallel transect effort by half significantly affected target strength distributions but not pollan density estimates. Density estimates were affected by statistical analysis method where pollan density was highest, with geostatistical analysis providing higher estimates than the arithmetic mean. Hydroacoustic assessments may provide a reliable index of pollan abundance over time and between lakes but future research should investigate the effects of temporal and abiotic factors.

Diatom relative frequencies and absolute abundances were subjected to several manipulations, including application of a weighted-averaging transfer function for summer water temperature, conversion of valve concentrations to cell biovolumes, biostratigraphic rate-of-change, and taxonomic richness estimated by rarefaction analysis. The major directions of variability within the derived diatom data were explored using principal components analysis. Diatom-inferred lakewater temperatures and indices of diatom palaeoproductivity declined during late-Holocene cooling, and they faithfully record post-'Little Ice Age' warming. Between similar to2000 cal. BP and the 'Little Ice Age', which includes the coldest intervals of the Neoglacial, diatom assemblages diversified and destabilized, reflecting a state of intermediate disturbance. Together, these results examine different methods of interpreting freshwater diatom stratigraphic data with the objective of gaining palaeoclimatic insights from fossil assemblages.

Here, we applied a reaction-transport diagenetic model to investigate sediment P dynamics in the Bay of Quinte, a polymictic, spatially complex embayment of Lake Ontario, (Canada). We quantified spatial and temporal variability of sediment P binding forms and estimated P diffusive fluxes and sediment P retention in different parts of the bay. Our model supports the notion that diagenetic recycling of redox sensitive and organic bound P forms drive sediment P release. In the recent years, summer sediment P diffusive fluxes varied in the range of 3.2-3.6 mg Pm-2 d(-1) in the upper bay compared to 1.5 mg Pm-2 d(-1) in the middle-lower bay. Meanwhile sediment P retention ranged between 71% and 75% in the upper and middle-lower bay, respectively. The reconstruction of temporal trends of internal P loading in the past century, suggests that against the backdrop of reduced external P inputs, sediment P exerts growing control over the lake nutrient budget. Higher sediment P diffusive fluxes since mid-20th century with particular increase in the past 20 years in the shallower upper basins, emphasize limited sediment P retention potential and suggest prolonged ecosystem recovery, highlighting the importance of ongoing P control measures.

Permeability During Magma Expansion and Compaction	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												Plinian lapilli from the 1060 Common Era Glass Mountain rhyolitic eruption of Medicine Lake Volcano, California, were collected and analyzed for vesicularity and permeability. A subset of the samples were deformed at a temperature of 975 degrees, under shear and normal stress, and postdeformation porosities and permeabilities were measured. Almost all undeformed samples fall within a narrow range of vesicularity (0.7-0.9), encompassing permeabilities between approximately 10(-15)m(2) and 10(-10)m(2). A percolation threshold of approximately 0.7 is required to fit the data by a power law, whereas a percolation threshold of approximately 0.5 is estimated by fitting connected and total vesicularity using percolation modeling. The Glass Mountain samples completely overlap with a range of explosively erupted silicic samples, and it remains unclear whether the erupting magmas became permeable at porosities of approximately 0.7 or at lower values. Sample deformation resulted in compaction and vesicle connectivity either increased or decreased. At small strains permeability of some samples increased, but at higher strains permeability decreased. Samples remain permeable down to vesicularities of less than 0.2, consistent with a potential hysteresis in permeability-porosity between expansion (vesiculation) and compaction (outgassing). We attribute this to retention of vesicle interconnectivity, albeit at reduced vesicle size, as well as bubble coalescence during shear deformation. We provide an equation that approximates the change in permeability during compaction. Based on a comparison with data from effusively erupted silicic samples, we propose that this equation can be used to model the change in permeability during compaction of effusively erupting magmas.

Formation of the hydrothermal system in Geysers Valley (Kronotsky Nature Reserve, Kamchatka) and triggers of the Giant Landslide	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY					13th International Symposium on Water-Rock Interaction (WRI)	AUG 16-20, 2010	Guanajuato, MEXICO					The Geysers Valley hydrothermal system is hosted within a system of two permeable faults (revealed by mapping thermal features), located above a suggested partially melted magmatic body and recharged by meteoric water along the outcrops of rhyolite-dacite extrusions. Fast erosion is stimulating the significant discharge rate, the geyser's cycling mode and landslide events. Natural state thermal hydrodynamic modeling shows that 20-30 ka of high temperature upflow of 250 kg/s and an enthalpy of 900 kJ/kg could build up the hydrothermal system in the Geysers Valley basin with output discharge parameters comparable to those at the current level. Modeling also shows that steam accumulation below an inclined caprock may have hydrothermal eruption potential. The Giant Landslide took place on June 3, 2007, when 20 x 10(6) m(3) of rocks were shifted 2 km downstream, more than 23 geysers were buried or submerged, and Podprudnoe Lake was dammed, injecting cold water into submerged geysers. Possible triggers of the Giant Landslide include the inclination of the sliding plane towards the Geysernaya river basin, a pressure increase in the fluid-magma system, hanging block saturation by water during spring flooding, hydrothermal alteration weakening of the sliding plane, and steam explosions.

This study aimed to analyse variations in phytoplankton biomass in Daheiting Reservoir before and after cage removal. Cage aquaculture in this reservoir was terminated in the spring of 2017. Changes in phytoplankton biomass were analysed using multispectral satellite data. Chlorophyll a concentration increased from 2016 to 2018, but decreased from 2018 to 2021. Cyanobacterial blooms were absent from 2016 to 2017, but suddenly appeared over an area of similar to 12.76 km(2) in 2018 and gradually decreased to 0.55 km(2) in 2021. Following the removal of cage aquaculture in 2017, phytoplankton biomass of the reservoir initially rapidly increased, peaking in 2018, and then declined. The rapid, short-term increase in phytoplankton biomass after cage removal might be due to sudden lack of algae predators (silver carp, bighead carp, and sturgeon, prey on algae and plankton), as cultured fish were removed from the reservoir. Decreased nutrient input in the water and the growth of wild fish resulted in subsequent decreases in phytoplankton biomass. These findings provide a reference for research methods and decision support for the change in phytoplankton biomass after cage removal.						li, jun sheng/0000-0002-8590-9736													0018-8158	1573-5117				DEC	2022	849	21					4759	4775		10.1007/s10750-022-05014-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-022-05014-4		SEP 2022											WOS:000859287200001

Late Pleistocene aeolian activity in the cold desert of Ladakh: A record from sand ramps	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Ladakh, northwest India, lies in the rain shadow zone of the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) where sand ramps provide a good record of past aeolian activity. Here we present an archive from five sand ramps that is based on their sedimentological structure and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) chronology. Sedimentary architecture indicates that the sand ramps are composite records of aeolian, hill slope erosion and fluvio-lacustrine activity. The OSL chronology suggests that aridity and aeolian activity was dominant during 25-17 ka and <12-8 ka. Wetter conditions, as evidenced from intra-dunal lake formation and fluvial gullying, prevailed at similar to 12 ka and 7 ka. These dry and wet phases correspond to variations in SW monsoon strength. One sand ramp, at Saboo, is studied in detail using mineral susceptibility and clay mineralogy. The environmental magnetic susceptibility shows significant enhancement in fluvial and lacustrine sediments and also shows sharp positive excursions at hiatuses where a hard crust is formed, and confirms warm and wet conditions at similar to 12 ka and similar to 7 ka BP. Clay mineralogy is dominated by illite and shows no changes through the profile, suggesting that sediment generation took place mainly due to physical weathering and that the threshold of climate fluctuations between wet and dry phases (as visible in magnetic mineralogy) were never reached so as to alter the clay mineralogy.

J	Itkonen, A; Salonen, VP				Itkonen, Arto; Salonen, Veli-Pekka			The response of sedimentation in three varved lacustrine sequences to air temperature, precipitation and human impact	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Human activity and climatic forcing have influenced sedimentation in three of Finland's deepest lakes during the last centuries. High-resolution sediment sequences of Lake Paijanne, Lake Paajarvi and Lake Pyhajarvi represent records of the last 440 years, 839 years and 633 years, respectively. The accumulation rates of dry matter, organic carbon and biogenic silica refer to changes in human activity in the catchments. However, they also reveal the importance of climatic forcing on lake sediment deposition. A significant correlation was found between instrumentally measured records of temperature (163 years) and precipitation (148 years), and varve thickness. Warm winter months indicating a short ice-cover period have the strongest control on varve thickness. This shows that wind-driven resuspension of littoral material is the forcing mechanism of climate on lake sediments. The long-term human-induced erosion pulses observed may even have magnified the climatic signals in some cases. Nevertheless, increased anthropogenic field erosion in the catchment, and the associated leaching of bioavailable nutrients, hampers the observation of climate signals, especially during the last 50 years, in the lakes studied.																			0921-2728					JAN	1994	11	3					323	332		10.1007/BF00677992	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00677992													WOS:000208333800003

In the mid-1970s, the diversion of wastewaters elsewhere reduced epilimnetic total phosphorus concentration by similar to 40% from > 100 mg P m(-3) in 5 years, but this was not enough to eliminate cyanobacterial blooms. In 1979-1984, hypolimnetic oxygenation was applied to decrease internal nutrient loading, but pumping warm surface water to the hypolimnion probably intensified gas ebullition from the sediment, carrying nutrients to the epilimnion and intensifying cyanobacterial blooms. Intensive fish removal in 1989-1994 was more successful. Five years of summer trawling removed over three-quarters of roach and smelt stock, and after the two most intensive fishing years, TP and chlorophyll concentrations abruptly decreased by similar to 35%. During subsequent years fish removal continued at similar to 30% intensity and maintained chlorophyll and total nutrient concentrations at a lower level until the end of the study. At the same time, the frequency of cyanobacterial blooms decreased from annual to twice per decade. Larger-scale oxygenation after 2010 no longer resulted in ebullition, and its effect on phytoplankton was indistinguishable from natural variability. Consequently, it was abandoned. The intensity of fish removal needed to maintain the present status of the lake is still awaiting evaluation.

Previous studies have focused on comparisons between relative mean dry/wet conditions and those linked to the Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the Little Ice Age (LIA); however, uncertainties remain regarding the relationship between precipitation changes and Pacific SST anomalies under sub-cool internal conditions within the LIA. Herein, we present a composite high-resolution monsoon precipitation record (from 1400 CE to the present) based on chroma and median grain size data from Lake Nvshan sediments in the Jiang-Huai (JH) region, central eastern China. The results indicate that more (less) precipitation in the JH region could be associated with the warm (cold) Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) phase on inter-decadal scales. We also observed an enhanced modulating effect of the PDO on JH precipitation during the late LIA. These changes in the modulating effect were likely a response to enhanced PDO amplitudes induced by increased effective radiative forcing.

Formations of the Catskill Delta complex, Finger Lakes district, New York, slipped horizontally up to 8 cm. Horizontal slip is measured by the offset of ENE-striking joints. Alleghanian joints striking 330-350 degrees display a right-lateral slip with an average value of 1.9 cm, while joints striking 004-010 degrees slip in the left-lateral sense with an average value of 1.3 cm. The maximum horizontal stress (S-H) driving this slip falls between 350 degrees and 004 degrees, the orientation of local Alleghanian layer-parallel shortening as indicated by both disjunctive and pencil cleavage. By commonality of orientation, we infer that slip on Alleghanian joints is driven contemporaneously with layer-parallel shortening. If so, the offset ENE-striking joints predate the Alleghanian stress field. These observations mean that both pre-Alleghanian and early Alleghanian joints persist through a period of penetrative strain. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Stolze, S; Dörfler, W; Monecke, T; Nelle, O				Stolze, Susann; Doerfler, Walter; Monecke, Thomas; Nelle, Oliver			Evidence for climatic variability and its impact on human development during the Neolithic from Loughmeenaghan, County Sligo, Ireland	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												High-resolution pollen and geochemical analyses conducted on a sediment profile from a small lake in County Sligo, Ireland, revealed that human development during the Neolithic was influenced by pronounced climatic oscillations. The primeval woodland around the lake experienced a considerable transformation coinciding with the elm decline at 3810 BC. The subsequent increase in summer temperatures and decrease in precipitation favoured wheat cultivation in the lake's catchment area, which was practised for approximately 140 years. A shift towards pastoral farming took place with the establishment of exceptionally dry conditions between 3650 and 3560 BC, when lake level and influx of allochthonous material were notably low. The onset of cool and wet conditions at the transition from the Early to Middle Neolithic possibly caused the initial decline of human activity in the area. Periods of particularly high precipitation during the Middle and early Late Neolithic contributed to the abandonment of the area by the first farmers. Comparison of the proxy record from the study site with other palynological and archaeological records from Ireland suggests that climatic variability on the decadal to centennial scale represented a primary control on the nature and duration of farming practices during the Neolithic.

The phylogenetic relationships among Cottus and related taxa were estimated from mitochondrial DNA 12S rRNA and control region (CR) sequences, the freshwater sculpins examined falling into five lineages (A-E). Lineage A consisted of Trachidermus fasciatus and C. kazika, both having a catadromous life-history. The remaining species. (lineages B-E) spawn in freshwater habitats regardless of life-history (amphidromous, lacustrine or fluvial), suggesting that the various life-history types post-dated a common ancestor of lineages B-E. Molecular clock estimates suggested a Pliocene-Pleistocene radiation (or Miocene-Pliocene from the alternative clock) of lineages B-E. In eastern Eurasia, speciation with life-history changes to amphidromous or fluvial styles has apparently occurred independently in some lineages, as a general pattern. Mitochondrial DNA CR phylogeny showed the monophyletic Baikalian cottoids (Cottoidei) to be nested within Cottus and Trachidermus, suggesting that the former ecologically and morphologically divergent cottoids may have originated from a single lineage which invaded the ancient lake.

Closed time of the sluice gate creates a good condition for sand bar formation at the channel entrance under the action of waves. Basing on the conditions of waves and water depth at the entrance of the Takase Flood Diversion Channel as well as combination with the classification of sand bar formation in the previous researches (Nguyen (2005), (2006) and Tanaka (2005)), a demarcation between emergence and submergence of sand bar formation was proposed via the dimensionless water depth at the mouth. This paper shows that emerged sand bar forms certainly at the channel entrance in the winter with a present river mouth depth. In order to limit influences of sand bar on the operation of the channel entrance, water depth at the entrance should be larger as a result sand bar forming under the water level, when sluice gate is opened, the flow in the channel could flush the bar easily.

The influence of a growing world tourism market on the regional development causes a shift towards higher economic efficiency, including a change in the structure of the accommodations, a demand for higher quality and for a ''production of events''. This may lead to an increasing pressure on groups wanting to make use of the recreational resources without being involved in the tourism market. One major conflict between various recreational functions can be observed on the northern shore of Lake Mattsee. 20 years ago people used to occupy small plots along the shore of the lake and build cabins and small houses in order to be able to stay over the weekend or just to store their bathing things. The authorities tried to control this development, and after some heated dispute a compromise resulted in a spatial segregation: only small areas were reserved for buildings, the rest had to be cleared. Ten years later the demand for land and recreation is greater than ever before. With a detailed analysis of the strategy for securing ''recreation spaces'', of the built environment, the patterns of use and the patterns of social contacts against a background of theories about ''place identity'' it can be assumed that ''recreation spaces'' are not simply physical places but have a very marked influence on the action potential and a symbolic meaning for the users. They are spaces for recreation, communication, and can be vital for the users' personal identities.																			0029-9138						1993	135						215	242																WOS:A1993MW97200012

Maximum growth (0.54 doublings day-1) and photosynthetic (3.7 mg C 10-9 cells h-1) rates were highest at 23 and 17.degree. C and decreased with decreasing temperature (i.e. 11 and 5.degree. C). Even though temperatures of 11 and 5.degree. C are suboptimal for growth of F. crotonensis, they still resulted in 68 and 31%, respectively, of maximum growth rates at 23 and 17.degree. C. Field data show that the F. crotonensis population in Pigeon Bay withstands an annual temperature variation of greater than 20.degree. C and that at 5.degree. C it achieves densities as high as 25% of maximum summer density. These laboratory and field data give strong support that F. crotonensis is eurythermal. The onset of light saturation of both growth and photosynthesis of F. crotonensis occurred at fairly low irradiances, suggesting that it is adaptable to a low light environment.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				JUN	1986	3	3					371	381		10.1080/02705060.1986.9665128	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1986.9665128													WOS:A1986C646700009

The numbers of cards per year decreased following severe winters, suggesting the species' susceptibility to hard weather. The date of laying of the first egg extended from February to September, with a mode in early May. Modal clutch size was 4 (range 1-8), and modal brood size 3, but there were problems in observing broods reliably due to the species' secretive behaviour. Fifty-three per cent of nests whose outcome was known were successful; 35 % of nest failures were due to flooding. Nests on ponds and lakes were significantly more successful than those on rivers and streams; laying dates varied significantly between wetland types, with nests on canals earliest and those on rivers latest. Nests on rivers, subject to fluctuating water levels, experienced significantly higher rates of failure through flooding than those on waters such as canals, where water levels were artificially controlled.																			0006-3657					JUL	1993	40		2				107	114		10.1080/00063659309477135	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00063659309477135													WOS:A1993LP71700003

Prior studies of the southern Altiplano, the location of the world's largest salt flat, the Salar de Uyuni, and its neighbor, the Salar de Coipasa, generally agree in their reconstructions of the climate history of the past similar to 24 ka. Some studies, however, have highly divergent climatic records and interpretations of earlier periods. In this study, lake-level variation was reconstructed from a similar to 14-m-long sediment core from the Salar de Coipasa. These sediments span the last similar to 40 ka. Lacustrine sediment accumulation was apparently continuous in the basin from similar to 40 to 6 ka, with dry or very shallow conditions afterward. The fossil diatom stratigraphy and geochemical data (C-13, N-15, %Ca, C/N) indicate fluctuations in lake level from shallow to moderately deep, with the deepest conditions correlative with the Heinrich-1 and Younger Dryas events. The stratigraphy shows a continuous lake of variable depth and salinity during the last glacial maximum and latter stages of Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage 3 and is consistent with environmental inferences and the original chronology of a drill core from Salar de Uyuni.																			0033-5894	1096-0287				MAR	2019	91	2					881	891		10.1017/qua.2018.108	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/qua.2018.108													WOS:000464585000027
J	Curry, BB				Curry, BB			Paleochemistry of lakes Agassiz and Manitoba based on ostracodes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The ionic composition and salinity of Lake Manitoba and its late-glacial precursor, Lake Agassiz, changed significantly over the past 11 000 years. The paleochemical record reported here is based on modern analog environments of ostracodes identified in a new 14.5 m core from southern. Lake Manitoba. The ionic composition of Lake Manitoba today is dominated by Na+, Cl-, and HCO3-, with much less Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+. Evaporative concentration of modern Lake Manitoba water would lead to greater salinity and the near depletion of Ca2+ due to continued precipitation of calcite. During periods of highest salinity in the Kolocene, however, Lake Manitoba supported Limnocythere staplini. Today this species inhabits waters in which [Ca2+] > [HCO3-], including springs associated with groundwater in Paleozoic bedrock discharging into Lake Winnipegosis (and eventually, after much dilution, into Lake Manitoba). Further complicating the Holocene record are intervals containing Limnocythere friabilis that suggest periodic influxes of dilute water, probably from the Assiniboine River, which bypasses Lake Manitoba today. The variations in Holocene paleochemistry indicated by the ostracode record imply changes in the proportion of overland flow plus precipitation relative to groundwater inputs to Lake Manitoba, independent of changes in evaporation relative to precipitation.

A high population of granules (100-300 nm in diameter) consist of a wall (20-40 nm in thickness) and a larger core; the former is rich in organic elements, such as carbon, oxygen and sulfur, and the core contains Ni-Fe-Mg rich silicates.

J	Carter, JA				Carter, JA			Phytolith analysis and paleoenvironmental reconstruction from Lake Poukawa Core, Hawkes Bay, New Zealand	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												As part of a multiproxy investigation, phytoliths were extracted from sediments in a 197-m core in Hawkes Bay, New Zealand. They provide a continuous vegetation-climate record spanning the time period from at least the last interglacial (marine oxygen isotope stage 5) to the present. The phytolith record demonstrates that grass/cyperaceae grew during warmer periods and woody taxa dominated the site during colder periods. During the present interglacial, the Poukawa basin is occupied by a shallow lake surrounded by an extensive fen. During colder-drier periods, the floor of the basin dried out and woody taxa occupied the basin floor. This contrasts with the pollen record, which demonstrates a converse pattern. The apparent discrepancy reflects the purely local provenance of the phytolith assemblage. Significant changes in phytolith assemblages occur at the same depth as major tephras, indicating a sharp decline in trees and shrubs and a surge in grass and cyperaceae. A series of successional changes follow each major tephra fall. Initially, the woody taxa are killed off and replaced by grass and cyperaccae that rapidly colonise the fresh surface.

This study utilizes two global gridded SPEI datasets to analyze drought characteristics (i.e., frequency, duration, and severity) in East Africa from 1981 to 2021. To estimate the sustainability of water resources over the region, the study employed the Reliability-Resiliency-Vulnerability framework (RRV) that aggregates the drought characteristics (i.e., frequency, duration, and severity). Drought is deemed to have occurred when the SPEI value falls below -1, so the threshold for water demand (RRV) is also computed at a threshold level of -1. The findings indicate pronounced changes in drought patterns across East Africa, with evidence of varying degrees of recovery and resilience in different regions. Employing the RRV framework over the East Africa region to determine how the region can cope with the effects of drought revealed a median range of RRV of 0.61 to 0.80, indicating a sustainable situation during the study period. This indicates that despite the recorded drought incidences, the water catchments of lakes, rivers, and major water towers are not threatened and, thus, less vulnerable. Although certain regions exhibit declining resilience and vulnerability to drought impacts, there is a need for targeted mitigation measures and policy interventions to safeguard water resources.					; Ayugi, Brian/C-3372-2017; Brian Odhiambo, Ayugi/C-3372-2017; Rajasekar, Adharsh/AAT-8464-2020; POSSET, Kokou Romaric/OOK-1705-2025; Babaousmail, Hassen/ABA-1211-2021	MUMO, Richard/0000-0003-2309-2609; Brian Odhiambo, Ayugi/0000-0003-3660-7755; Rajasekar, Adharsh/0000-0002-1917-0494; POSSET, Kokou Romaric/0009-0008-6029-1918														2225-1154				JUL	2024	12	7							92	10.3390/cli12070092	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli12070092													WOS:001276573000001

But annual quantitative reconstructions by lake deposits are scarce because discrete sampling and analysis. The new approach to study sediment records appeared due to scanning microanalysis of cores in situ. X-ray fluorescence analysis on synchrotron radiation in the Institute of Nuclear Physics, Novosibirsk, appeared to be the most effective. Sub-millimeter layered structures of bottom sediments from Siberian lakes as well as tree ring series in surrounded areas are studied. Elements composing organic component of sediments (Br, I, U) are usually responding to temperature. And elements from clastic mineral part (Rb, Sr, Ti, Y, Zr) more reflect annual precipitation and runoff. On this base air temperature, precipitation and lake level are restored on annual scale for the last two millennia. Climate variability reconstructed by geochemistry of lake sediments and dendrochronology reveals similar trends. Availability of several basic series of geochemical indices extends the scope for quantitative reconstructions of sought quantity. That becomes in the line of extrapolation, interpolation (detailed elaboration) and combination. Geochemical time series allowed estimating regression equations for tree ring width and extrapolating these short chronologies. Specifically, aridization trend is revealed in Transbaikalia for the last 2000 yrs (Arachlei Lake) by growth index, which is not conflict with palinological data. Also rare sampled palinological series, transferred to biomes, are worked out in detail to annual chronologies by training transfer function on element content in the same samples (Teletskoe Lake). Combined reconstruction of summer temperature is made for Altai mountain region using both geochemical parameters of lake sediments and independent biological series in multiple regression estimations.

J	TIMMS, BV				TIMMS, BV			THE CONSERVATION STATUS OF ATHALASSIC LAKES IN NEW-SOUTH-WALES, AUSTRALIA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												To provide an overview for the State Pollution Control Commission of NSW, 102 lakes were visited throughout the state during the 1988-9 summer to ascertain their ecological condition. The sites chosen covered a spectrum of geomorphic types in approximate proportion to their perceived relative abundance. Field work concentrated on some physicochemical parameters and on zooplankton and littoral invertebrates. A summary of these features of the lakes of NSW is given. The most widespread problem is eutrophication, though for many lakes changes in trophic status could be part of wider changes in lakes since European settlement. A significant number of lakes suffer eroded shorelines and sedimentation. The introduced mosquito fish, Gambusia affinis, is associated with decreased diversity mainly in coastal lakes where also alien plants may be pestiferous. A few lakes in western areas have their flooding regime altered, while a number in the east are drained. With few exceptions there are no management programs to improve the conservation status of degraded lakes in NSW.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT 2	1992	243						435	444		10.1007/BF00007060	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007060													WOS:A1992JZ96300046

Diurnal fluctuations in pH, O2 saturation and temperature of the water were also recorded. Within the littoral region, daytime pH values > 9 were recorded; in the pelagial region of the lake, values remained near pH 7. Diatoms and green algae dominated the littoral phytoplankton especially in the innermost parts of the macrophyte stand, with cryptophytes (dominant in the pelagial area) occurring only in small numbers. At the outer parts of the macrophyte stand, water movements between the pelagial and littoral areas might rapidly increase the contribution of cryptophytes in the phytoplankton. The fall in algal cell volume during the night may have resulted from settling out of cells in the absence of wind-induced water movements, perhaps together with increased grazing pressure from dense swarms of Bosmina (up to 3000 individuals/l) which appeared during the night.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1980	10	6					533	537		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1980.tb01228.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1980.tb01228.x													WOS:A1980KT41800006

Acute mountain sickness in athletes with neurological impairments	JOURNAL OF REHABILITATION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT												Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is a symptom complex noticed commonly among high altitude travelers. The occurrence of AMS depends on multiple factors that have been studied extensively. However, AMS in individuals with neurological impairments has not been considered in detail. A total of 168 subjects, including active controls, inactive controls, and those with spinal cord injury (SCI), multiple sclerosis, and traumatic brain injury (TBI), were studied at the National Veterans Winter Sports Clinic in Snowmass, Colorado, from 2007 to 2009 for the occurrence of AMS. Lake Louise Score was used to quantify symptoms. A higher than anticipated occurrence of AMS (42.85%) among the study population was noted, with significantly higher Lake Louis Scores among athletes with neurological impairments. Disability group, prior history of AIMS, and prior occurrence of headache at high altitude could be used as predictors for the development of AMS symptoms. More research is warranted specifically targeting the interaction between factors affecting AMS and the pathophysiology of neurological impairments like SCI and TBI to further our understanding about prophylactic medications and treatments for AMS, especially because many military personnel with neurological impairments continue on Active Duty.

J	Litchman, E; Neale, PJ				Litchman, E; Neale, PJ			UV effects on photosynthesis, growth and acclimation of an estuarine diatom and cryptomonad	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a significant stressor in aquatic environments and can inhibit primary productivity of phytoplankton. The effects of UV depend on many factors, including phytoplankton community composition and acclimation status. Using spectrally resolved biological weighting functions (BWFs), we determined sensitivity of photosynthesis and acclimation to UV in a common estuarine diatom, Thalassiosira pseudonana (Hustedt) Hasle et Heimdal, and cryptomonad, Cryptomonas sp. Cryptomonas sp. grown under high PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) (250 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)) was significantly more sensitive to photoinhibition in the UV-B part of the spectrum (280 to 320 nm) than T pseudonana under high PAR. Growth under low irradiance (25 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)) increased sensitivity of T pseudonana. After a week-long exposure to moderate UV radiation, sensitivity of Cryptomonas sp. declined, while sensitivity of T pseudonana did not change. Growth rates and chlorophyll a-specific absorption decreased in both species. Based on the BWFs obtained in this study, we predict 11 to 26% UV inhibition of depth-integrated primary production by these species under summer conditions in a shallow, turbid temperate estuary.					; Neale, Patrick/A-3683-2012	Litchman, Elena/0000-0001-7736-6332; Neale, Patrick/0000-0002-4047-8098													0171-8630						2005	300						53	62		10.3354/meps300053	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps300053													WOS:000232714900006

The relationship was examined between four measures of lake productivity [total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations, zooplankton density and biomass and growth in length and weight of age-0 yellow perch in ten central Alberta lakes. 2. In these lakes, average summer TP and Chl a levels were in the range 11-51 and 1.4-19.5-mu-g l-1, respectively. The interaction of TP and Chl a could explain 61% and 57% of the variance in total length and wet weight, respectively, of age-0 yellow perch sampled at the end of August. 3. The ability to predict first year fish growth from lake productivity is strongest at low levels of productivity (TP < 35-mu-g l-1). In the lakes studied, fish community structure is more complex at high levels of productivity (TP > 35-mu-g l-1), and more data on complex community level interactions seem necessary to predict fish growth in these systems.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				DEC	1991	26	3					519	525		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1991.tb01416.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1991.tb01416.x													WOS:A1991HC04600016

In this study, the distribution of Daihai Lake MPs and DOM was studied by fluorescence excited emission matrix (EEM) and micro-infrared spectroscopy, and the relationship between them was examined by two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS) and structural equation modelling (SEM) to obtain the influencing factors of pollution. The results indicate that the concentration of MPs in the surface ice layer is 1.35 times more than in the water and in the surface and bottom ice layers 1-2 times more than the middle layer. DOM in the ice cover is mainly protein-like (73.33%), and humus-like DOM (44.8%) is dominant in the water under the ice that is consistent with the distribution of MPs in the ice and water layer. As a result, MPs are more prospective to adsorb humus-like substances into the ice during migration. Through SEM analysis, it was concluded that human activities and the degree of economic development seriously affect the pollution level and the type of MPs and DOM in lakes. One of the most important factors in winter is the ice cover, and there is a strong correlation between the MPs and DOM in different ice layers. Combined with experimental data, it was concluded that the ice layer influences the distribution characteristics of the pollutants in lakes as well as the direction of migration. However, the adsorption mechanism of the ice is not clear, which will be a key direction for future research on microplastics in ice-covered lakes.

Effect of Experience with Predators on the Behavior and Survival of Muskellunge and Tiger Muskellunge	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We assessed predator acclimation as a technique to improve the poststocking survival of juvenile muskellunge Esox masquinongy and tiger muskellunge (muskellunge x northern pike E. lucius) in laboratory, pond, and lake experiments. For all experiments, a subset of esocids was exposed to feeding largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides (250-300 mm total length). In laboratory pools containing simulated vegetation (50% of pool), we tested the vulnerability of predator-acclimated and naive muskellunge and tiger muskellunge to largemouth bass predation. For both species, survival rates were similar regardless of predator experience. Predator-acclimated esocids, however, spent more time in the vegetation, indicating that exposure to predators may alter some behaviors. We also introduced equal numbers of naive and predator-acclimated tiger muskellunge into ponds and lakes containing largemouth bass. To determine the number of surviving fish, ponds were drained after 7 d, whereas lakes were sampled immediately after stocking and throughout the fall. We found similar survival rates between naive and predator-acclimated individuals, suggesting that predator acclimation techniques that are successful with other species are not effective in reducing losses of stocked muskellunge and tiger muskellunge.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				JAN	2012	141	1					139	146		10.1080/00028487.2011.652011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2011.652011													WOS:000301154500014

In this paper, ice and water samples of a typical reservoir, Biliuhe reservoir, were collected and analysed, and the comprehensive water quality was evaluated by the variable fuzzy recognition method. The results showed that the effect of 'salt exclusion' during ice formation was obvious, with exclusion factors of 10.54 and 1.26 for total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP), respectively. The evaluation results showed that the comprehensive water quality of the water column and ice were 2.68 and 1.44, respectively, during the freezing period. When considering the effect of salt exclusion, the TN and TP contents in the surface water of the reservoir were 3.15 and 2.62 times the previous contents, respectively, and the evaluation results showed that the surface water quality decreased by 5%. The effect of salt exclusion during ice formation in winter mainly occurred in the top layer of the water column under ice in the deep reservoir. It is necessary to further study the influence of reservoir sediments on water quality in ice-covered water systems.

Pacitan is a part of The Thousand Mountains (Gunung Sewu in Javanese language) karst area and located in Southern Coastal of Java Island. Gunung Sewu karst area ranges over 85 km from west in Yogyakarta Special Province, to the east in East Java Province. Water scarcity is one of the issues in Pacitan due to the porous texture of the karst underground; most of the precipitation trickles immediately down into extensive system of sinkholes and caves. Thus, no surface water rivers, brooks or springs can be found in the area, especially during dry season where water supply, such as little lakes, called telaga, are depleted. Three sub-districts of Pacitan that include in Gunung Sewu karst area, i.e. Donorojo, Punung, and Pringkuku, suffer water shortage, especially during dry season, where the local communities need to walk up to 5 kilometers in order to take water for their domestic use. However, State-owned Water Company (Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum/PDAM) that has developed since 1992 in Pacitan, contributes in water supply in these areas and it has covered 70% in three kecamatan (sub-districts) by building IPA and is currently developing to cover the rest of the area by utilizing big water sources. PDAM and The Ministry of Public Work support the water treatment installation (Instalasi Pengolahan Air/IPA), especially in these three sub-districts. Furthermore, adaptive capacity has been developed in the local community of karst area in Pacitan, e.g. planting cultivars resistant to drought (cassava, maize, soybean, and groundnut) or doing multi cropping between those cultivars, and planting rainwater harvesting and artificial aquifer.

Temperature and fuel availability control fire size/severity in the boreal forest of central Northwest Territories, Canada	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The north-central Canadian boreal forest experienced increased occurrence of large and severe wildfires caused by unusually warm temperatures and drought events during the last decade. It is, however, difficult to assess the exceptional nature of this recent wildfire activity, as few long-term records are available in the area. We analyzed macroscopic sedimentary charcoal from four lakes and pollen grains from one of those lakes to reconstruct long-term fire regimes and vegetation histories in the boreal forest of central Northwest Territories. We used regional estimates of past temperature and hydrological changes to identify the climatic drivers of fire activity over the past 10,000 years. Fires were larger and more severe during warm periods (before ca. 5000 cal yrs. BP and during the last 500 years) and when the forest landscape was characterized by high fuel abundance, especially fire-prone spruce. In contrast, colder conditions combined with landscape opening (i.e., lower fuel abundance) during the Neoglacial (after ca. 5000 cal yrs. BP) were related with a decline in fire size and severity. Fire size and severity increased during the last five centuries, but remained within the Holocene range of variability. According to climatic projections, fire size and severity will likely continue to increase in central Northwest Territories in response to warmer conditions, but precipitation variability, combined with increased abundance of deciduous species or opening of the landscape, could limit fire risk in the future.

In fact deposition patterns reflect, not only, transport processes, but can also provide useful information as to inflowing sediment load in a reservoir. In particular the paper reports the results obtained by way of a numerical model applied to the Rendina reservoir, an artificial lake located in Basilicata (the South of Italy), to simulate the path and the entity of turbidity currents. The object is to investigate possible strategy to reduce the trapping sediment in this lake. The history of which is particularly interesting from the point of view of erosion processes of catchment areas and sedimentation rates. The simulation performed by means of the SMS (Surfacewater Modelling System) to reproduce turbidity currents was carried out bearing in mind the real flow rate and sediment load data observed in the inlet section in a typical year. The simulation started in October, a month when, due to the irrigation use of the reservoir, the normal water level is at its lowest and the specific sediment load also reaches its highest rate. Model results compared against data from bathymetric surveys showed that the path of the turbidity currents is strongly influenced by the incoming concentration values in the lake during the water-filling period which corresponds to greater erosion and transport in the catchment area. Moreover, the presence of several metres in depth of sediment near the dam confirmed the possibility that the high sediment load that arrives in this area in the early months of the rainy season, after a typically dry summer, creates an equilibrium that is not very sensitive to the changed incoming solid concentration.

Washwater from the barn had been flowing directly into Appleman Lake, and may have been contributing to lake degradation and loss of recreational opportunities for residents. After one full year of operation, significant reductions in the concentrations of five-day biological oxygen demand (62-81%), reactive phosphate (62-89%), total phosphorus (49-78%), ammonia-nitrogen (50-70%), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (36-57%), and total suspended solids (65%) have been found. Additionally, reductions in dissolved solids (up to 39%), nitrites (up to 100%), and nitrates (up to 100%) have been shown, but these results lack statistical significance due to extremely high variation in sample values. Outflow fecal coliform counts have been monitored. Higher reduction values were found during summer operation, but some reductions have been found throughout the year. Solid accumulation has become a problem with the system A layer of sludge 10 cm thick has built up over the first third of the wetland cells.

Here, we quantified the seasonal and size-dependent diet and distribution of introduced Yellow Perch and evaluated their direct effects on age-0 kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka in a 3,793-ha mesotrophic reservoir during 2016, 15 years after the initial discovery of Yellow Perch. We compared these effects to those of Brown Trout Salmo trutta, which have been present in the reservoir since it was formed. Spatial overlap between kokanee and Yellow Perch occurred for less than 7 d during April and was confined to the inlet region as fry stocked upstream entered the reservoir. Predation from Brown Trout was 39-fold greater than predation by Yellow Perch during this time. After fry funneled through the inlet, minimal spatial overlap was observed seasonally between Yellow Perch and age-0 kokanee, particularly during summer, when a thermal refuge formed. Furthermore, age-0 kokanee outgrew 58% of piscivorous-sized Yellow Perch by June and outgrew 95% by October. Although age-0 kokanee were more morphologically vulnerable to Brown Trout throughout the year, Brown Trout occupied nearshore areas away from pelagic kokanee. Yellow Perch exhibited a similar trophic role as Brown Trout by consuming mostly invertebrates (95.8% and 88.1%, respectively). The diet of each species contained over 25% Daphnia, but we saw no evidence that planktivory by Yellow Perch affected the abundance of Daphnia available to kokanee. Peak Daphnia densities in June 2016 (23.9-39.0 individuals/L) were the same as or higher than those recorded during 1993-2000, before Yellow Perch were discovered. Our study represents one of few in-depth evaluations of introduced Yellow Perch in a montane reservoir. More empirical evaluations of the effects of introduced mesopredators are needed for refining risk assessments and guiding appropriate management actions.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				FEB	2019	39	1					172	190		10.1002/nafm.10257	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10257													WOS:000459226900016

Despite early and intensive treatment with amphotericin B, both patients died 3 to 5 days after the onset of illness. Amoebae were observed in wet preparations of CSF and in sections of cerebral tissue and were identified as Naegleria fowleri by the indirect immunofluorescent antibody technique. The amoebae were highly virulent in mice. The isolate of N. fowleri was extremely sensitive in vitro to amphotericin B (minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC], 0.15 .mu.g/ml), somewhat sensitive to miconazole (MIC, 25 .mu.g/ml), and resistant to rifampin (MIC, .ltoreq. 100 .mu.g/ml). Treatment with amphotericin B (7.5 mg/kg of body weight per day) administered i.p. protected 60% of the mice. Lower doses of amphotericin B alone or in combination with miconazole (100 mg/kg) or rifampin (220 mg/kg) were not protective. Amphotericin B evidently remains the single effective agent in treatment of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis.																			0022-1899	1537-6613					1981	143	2					193	199		10.1093/infdis/143.2.193	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/infdis/143.2.193								7217717					WOS:A1981LK77500008

The creation of reservoirs with significant storage capacity makes it possible to solve a wide range of water-management problems, including the use of falling water energy for hydropower purposes, and maintenance of the uninterrupted water supply and navigation. Since constructed dams are usually operated by hydropower companies, the regulatory regime for the discharge of water into the lower pool is often determined by the daily electricity consumption regime. Intra-day variations in the volume of water discharges through hydroelectric power stations generate multidirectional streams in the upper pool, which can affect the operation of other water withdrawal systems. This paper considers the effect of intraday variations in water discharges into the lower pool on the dynamic and physical properties of the water mass in the region of the location of drinking water-intake heads of Perm city and the quality of the withdrawn water.					; Lepikhin, Anatoly/GOE-6723-2022; Богомолов, Андрей/GXZ-7836-2022; Parshakova, Yanina/J-9745-2015; Lyubimova, Tatyana/AHE-2311-2022	Lahin, Urii/0000-0001-8058-5587; Lepihin, Anatolii/0000-0001-9874-3424; Bogomolov, Andrei/0000-0003-0626-4069; Parshakova, Yanina/0000-0002-0234-3854; 														2073-4441				DEC	2021	13	24							3577	10.3390/w13243577	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13243577													WOS:000737433000001

We measured biomarkers (nitrite/nitrate (NOx), 8-isoprostane) in exhaled breath condensate (EBC), spirometry, and respiratory symptoms in 11 former smokers with moderate-to-severe COPD and nine former smokers without airflow obstruction during periods of low and high ozone air pollution. High ozone levels were associated with increased NOx in EBC in both COPD (8.7 (+/- 8.5) vs. 28.6 (+/- 17.6) mol/L on clean air vs. pollution days, respectively, p < 0.01) and control participants (7.6 (+/- 16.5) vs. 28.5 (+/- 15.6) mol/L on clean air vs. pollution days, respectively, p = 0.02). There was no difference in pollution effect between COPD and control groups, and no difference in EBC 8-isoprostane, pulmonary function, or respiratory symptoms between clean air and pollution days in either group. Former smokers both with and without airflow obstruction developed airway oxidative stress and inflammation in association with ozone air pollution episodes.

Mortality and Carrier Status of Bluegills Exposed to Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus Genotype IVb at Different Temperatures	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC ANIMAL HEALTH												The emergence of the viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) genotype IVb (VHSV-IVb) in the Great Lakes of North America has led to concern that the virus might spread to natural fisheries and aquaculture in the southern USA. We exposed bluegills Lepomis macrochirus to VHSV-IVb by intraperitoneal injection at six temperatures from 10 degrees C to 30 degrees C and followed the disease course by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qrt-RT-PCR). Mortality of injected fish was 90% at 10 degrees C, 35% at 14 degrees C, and 10% at 18 degrees C; no mortality attributable to VHSV was observed at temperatures of 22-30 degrees C. In survivors tested at 21 d postchallenge, viral copies and prevalence determined by qrt-RT-PCR were inversely related to temperature, and VHSV-IVb could not be detected in fish held at temperatures above 22 degrees C. Similar results were obtained for bluegills that were exposed by cohabitation with the intraperitoneally injected fish. Acclimation of the fish to 12 degrees C after 21 d at higher temperatures did not appear to cause a re-emergence of the virus. Based on our findings, the temperature range of VHSV-IVb appears to be the same as published values for VHSV genotype I, which has an optimum of 9-12 degrees C and an upper limit of 18-20 degrees C.																			0899-7659	1548-8667					2011	23	2					85	91	PII 937260516	10.1080/08997659.2011.574086	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08997659.2011.574086								21834331					WOS:000291550100004

Spatial and temporal variations of persistent organic pollutants impacted by episodic sediment resuspension in southern Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The impacts of large-scale, episodic sediment resuspension on the cycling of polychlorinated biphenyl congeners (PCBs) were examined using a spatially coordinated air and water sampling strategy conducted in southern Lake Michigan in the late winters of 1998, 1999, and 2000. We found no significant temporal changes in gas phase, dissolved phase, or suspended sediment PCB concentrations despite large-scale seasonal storms occurring before and after sampling campaigns. Only gas phase and suspended sediment PCBs varied spatially. Higher total suspended material (TSM) concentrations and fraction organic carbon (f(oc)) were measured at sampling stations located in the near-shore region of southern Lake Michigan than at open-water sampling stations. Gas phase concentrations (Sigma PCB(g),) were higher in the west (0.436 +/- 0.200 ng/m(3), n = 11) and south (0.408 +/- 0.286 ng/m(3), n = 5) than the east (0.214 +/- 0.082 ng/m(3), n = 10) and central (0.253 +/- 0.145 ng/m(3), n = 8) regions of southern Lake Michigan. Dissolved phase concentrations (PCB) averaged 0.18 +/- 0.024 ng/L (n = 52): suspended sediment concentrations (Sigma PCB(s)) accounted for between 4% and 72% (23 +/- 4%, n = 52) of the total Sigma PCB concentrations (Sigma PCB(T) = Sigma PCB(d) + Sigma PCB(s)). Despite no consistent temporal variations in both dissolved phase or suspended sediment Sigma PCB concentrations, there were temporal and spatial variations in the distribution shift between phases that can be linked to sediment resuspension, not a state of equilibrium. Specifically, our analysis suggests sediment resuspension results in preferential sorption of heavier, more chlorinated PCB congeners. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Molecular Response of the Bloom-Forming Cyanobacterium, Microcystis aeruginosa, to Phosphorus Limitation	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Cyanobacteria blooms caused by species such as Microcystis have become commonplace in many freshwater ecosystems. Although phosphorus (P) typically limits the growth of freshwater phytoplankton populations, little is known regarding the molecular response of Microcystis to variation in P concentrations and sources. For this study, we examined genes involved in P acquisition in Microcystis including two high-affinity phosphate-binding proteins (pstS and sphX) and a putative alkaline phosphatase (phoX). Sequence analyses among ten clones of Microcystis aeruginosa and one clone of Microcystis wesenbergii indicates that these genes are present and conserved within the species, but perhaps not the genus, as phoX was not identified in M. wesenbergii. Experiments with clones of M. aeruginosa indicated that expression of these three genes was strongly upregulated (50- to 400-fold) under low inorganic P conditions and that the expression of phoX was correlated with alkaline phosphatase activity (p < 0.005). In contrast, cultures grown exclusively on high levels of organic phosphorus sources (adenosine 5'-monophosphate, beta-glycerol phosphate, and d-glucose-6-phosphate) or under nitrogen-limited conditions displayed neither high levels of gene expression nor alkaline phosphatase activity. Since Microcystis dominates phytoplankton assemblages in summer when levels of inorganic P (P-i) are often low and/or dominate lakes with low P-i and high organic P, our findings suggest this cyanobacterium may rely on pstS, sphX, and phoX to efficiently transport P-i and exploit organic sources of P to form blooms.

Comparative analyses of physiological assays and chlorophyll a variable fluorescence parameters: investigating the importance of phosphorus availability in oligotrophic and eutrophic freshwater systems	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Diverse measurements of nutrient status indicators were used to test the severity of physiological phosphorus (P) limitation of phytoplankton among lake systems ranging from oligotrophic to eutrophic, based on P and chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations. Metabolic assays and particulate nutrient ratios were used to estimate nutrient status at sites located in Lake Erie, Lake Ontario and Lake Huron. Variable fluorescence ratios (F (v)/F (m)), relative electron transport rates and their response to irradiance were measured by the pulse-amplitude-modulated fluorometer. Under summer stratified conditions, P deficiency was strongest in the oligotrophic sites and nitrogen (N) status indicators and Chl a variable parameters revealed no severe N deficiency. Nutrient amendment assays showed positive associations with P additions and Chl a fluorescence parameters at P-deficient sites. In the most oligotrophic sites, N additions revealed a modest increase only detected by the Chl a fluorescence parameters. Phytoplankton communities were also associated with nutrient status, where chrysophytes and cryptophytes were important in P-deficient sites and cyanobacteria, phyrrophyta, and diatoms were prevalent in nutrient-rich sites. The results confirmed that Chl a fluorescence parameters can reveal P deficiency and indicate its severity among the range of trophic status in aquatic systems.																			1386-2588	1573-5125				SEP	2017	51	3					359	375		10.1007/s10452-017-9622-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-017-9622-7													WOS:000408340600003

Recent lake level declines have raised concerns over future climate change impacts, including the risk of no outflows if the Lake Malawi Outflow Threshold (LMOT) is passed. Addressing calls for model co-production, we iteratively engage stakeholders in data collection, and eliciting local system insights and management priorities, to inform the development of a Water Evaluation And Planning (WEAP) model for the Lake Malawi Shire River Basin. We use a simple model setup and manual calibration to allow for data sparsity and limited documentation of historical management decisions. The model satisfactorily captures limited observed streamflow patterns of Lake Malawi tributaries and lake level variations for the period 1960-2009, however, small errors in lake level simulation significantly affect simulation of monthly outflows. The riparian countries, Malawi, Tanzania and Mozambique contribute approximately 55%, 41% and 4% respectively to lake inflows (1960-2009 average). Forced with 29 bias-corrected global climate model projections (2021-2050) and assuming no change in current operating rules of key infrastructure, the WEAP model simulates wide-ranging changes. These include much higher lake levels that would cause downstream floods, and much lower lake levels, including 11 projections that fall below the LMOT. Both outcomes would have major implications for downstream hydropower and irrigation. Future water management plans require identification and evaluation of strategies that can address multi-year shifts in lake levels and the uncertainty inherent in future climate and hydrological model outputs.					kolusu, seshagirirao/A-1643-2017; kolusu, seshagirirao/AAO-3460-2020; Conway, Declan/HCH-7778-2022; Jewitt, Graham/N-5919-2013; Dessai, Suraje/D-4219-2009	kolusu, seshagirirao/0000-0002-6090-5624; Bhave, Ajay/0000-0001-5896-8661; Jewitt, Graham/0000-0002-7444-7855; Dessai, Suraje/0000-0002-7879-9364; Conway, Declan/0000-0002-4590-6733													0022-1694	1879-2707				MAY	2020	584								124671	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124671	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124671													WOS:000527390200063

From the time of deglaciation (approximately 12000-11500 years BP) to 11000 BP the area was colonized by mainly nonarboreal flora dominated by Artemisia and Gramineae. Populus, the only tree taxon present, grew in sheltered areas, while Salix and Cyperaceae were common on poorly drained sites. Open parkland prevailed under a dry, windy climate. Summer temperatures were rising rapidly from glacial minima in response to increased solar insolation. By 11000 BP Picea (initially P. glauca) and Betula (mainly tree Betula) migrated to the area. Forest prevailed, but the canopy was likely more open than at present. By 9000 BP peak warm and dry conditions had passed, although conditions warmer and drier than at present persisted. Alnus migrated to the area 8450 BP. Pinus reached the Birch Mountains about 7500 BP. No major changes in vegetation have occurred since that time, suggesting that modern climatic conditions were established by 7500 BP.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				JAN	1986	23	1					11	20		10.1139/e86-002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e86-002													WOS:A1986A645500002

Controls on nitrous oxide production and consumption in reservoirs of the Ohio River Basin	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Aquatic ecosystems are a globally significant source of nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas, but estimates are largely based on studies conducted in streams and rivers with relatively less known about N2O dynamics in reservoirs. Due to long water residence times and high nitrogen (N) loading rates, reservoirs support substantial N processing and therefore may be particularly important sites of N2O production. Predicting N2O emissions from reservoirs is difficult due to complex interactions between microbial N processing in the oxygen-poor hypolimnion and oxygen-rich epilimnion. Here we present the results of a survey of N2O depth profiles in 20 reservoirs draining a broad range of land use conditions in four states in the U.S. Nitrous oxide was supersaturated in the epilimnion of 80% of the reservoirs and was undersaturated in only one, indicating that reservoirs in this region are generally a source of N2O to the atmosphere. Nitrous oxide was undersaturated in the hypolimnion of 10 reservoirs, supersaturated in 9, and transitioned from supersaturation to undersaturation in 1 reservoir that was monitored periodically from midsummer to fall. All reservoirs with a mean hypolimnion nitrate concentration less than 50 mu gNL(-1) showed evidence of net N2O consumption in the hypolimnion. All reservoirs sampled during lake turnover supported N2O production throughout the water column. These results indicate that N2O dynamics in reservoirs differ widely both among systems and through time but can be predicted based on N and oxygen availability and degree of thermal stratification.

It acts as the regulating center of water system in Yangcheng region. Yangchenghu Lake is a broad-shallow lake that its current is driven mainly by the surface wind and its tributaries. To simulate the lake current more precisely, a three-dimensional flow numerical model is established here with curvilinear orthogonal grid in horizontal direction and sigma coordinate in vertical direction by Delft3D. It simulated the 3D hydrodynamic characteristics of the lake under wind and inflows/outflows and calculated the water exchange among the different water bodies of the lake. Based on the former, a two-dimensional water quality numerical mode was established to simulate the pollutant's diffusion and transportation and the simulated results were analyzed. In order to improving water quality of the lake, reducing the pollutant concentration from the tributaries would be effective, especially reducing that from Yanglintang (RW2) and Weijingtang (RW1) in winter. The research in this paper would be useful to guide the water environment management of Yangchenghu Lake in the future.					shen, hong/HTQ-6147-2023																978-7-302-18662-5				2009							710	+		10.1007/978-3-540-89465-0_125	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-89465-0_125													WOS:000268750700125
J	Allende, L; Fontanarrosa, MS				Allende, Luz; Fontanarrosa, Maria Soledad			Addressing the trophic status in urban ponds: An evaluation of current trophic state indexes	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Ponds are generally understudied. Quality problems in urban freshwaters can arise from eutrophication, and trophic status classification gives information related to their ecological situation. Ponds may strongly differ from larger lakes for which most current trophic status classification methods have been developed. This paper seeks to compare and contrast the suitability of six trophic status indexes (TSI) and OECD trophic classifications system currently used to evaluate the eutrophication level of urban ponds in the Subtropical region. The trophic status was evaluated based on total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total nitrogen (TN) and phytoplankton chlorophyll a (Chl a) in 12 ponds placed in different cities from the Pampean region (Argentina), in the warm and cold seasons. Our results demonstrate that there was no relationship between pond size (0.08-2.45 ha) and trophic status. TSIs estimated with Chl a showed significant differences between seasons and the range oligotrophic-hypertrophic of trophism was encountered. Conversely, TSIs estimated with nutrient concentrations (TP, SRP, TN) did not. The pond's classification in trophic levels fell in the eutrophic-hypertrophic extreme, and only considering TN/TP broadened the trophic range. No relationship was encountered between Chl a and P; however, Chl a and TN/TP were positively correlated during the warm season. Lower trophic levels regarding TSI (Chl a) were generally associated with a dense floating-macrophyte cover. We suggest that the TSI considered should correspond to the latitudinal region in which the ponds are located. Our results indicate that it appears restrictive to consider only P contents in ponds to assess eutrophication. Under the proposed framework, the key issues for the study of pond trophic classification will be to include not only P but N concentrations and TN/TP. Also, phytoplankton Chl a concentration jointly with floating macrophytes biomass/coverage should be considered as diagnosis parameters.																			1442-9985	1442-9993				DEC	2023	48	8			SI		1828	1847		10.1111/aec.13425	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aec.13425		SEP 2023											WOS:001062148100001

Phytoplankton responses to nitrogen enrichment in Pacific Northwest, USA Mountain Lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Limited information is available about threshold lake nitrogen concentrations necessary to stimulate phytoplankton species and biomass responses in remote nitrogen-limited mountain lakes. We conducted in situ enrichment bioassays in mountain lakes within Mount Rainier, North Cascades, and Olympic National Parks in Washington State, USA to characterize phytoplankton species and biomass responses to nitrogen enrichment, and associated dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentration thresholds. Based on biomass and growth measurements, phytoplankton were nitrogen-limited or co-limited by nitrogen and phosphorus in the nine bioassay lakes. We identified 20 taxa that responded to nitrogen enrichment, and estimated response thresholds using nitrogen Monod half-saturation constants (K-s) for 18 of these taxa. DIN thresholds in nitrogen-limited lakes were 13 mu g N l(-1) for any increase in chlorophyll a, and 25 mu g N l(-1), for an increase beyond typical inter-annual chlorophyll a variation. K-s values ranged from 0.02 to 77 mu g N l(-1) across most N-responsive taxa, and diatom K-s values were higher than those previously quantified in U.S. Rocky Mountain lakes. Approximately, 75% of sampled mountain lakes in the parks have summer dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations below biomass response thresholds.

Exposure to sewage sludge had a significant effect on male mortality rates but no significant effects on the gonadosomatic index of males or females. There were no major effects of sludge exposure on testes androgen content or on testes release of androgens after in vitro gonadotrophin stimulation. Fecundity and the number of larvae produced were not significantly affected by the sludge exposure. There was a tendency for eggs and larvae from sludge-exposed females to have a higher mortality rate. At a population level, however, there was a major reduction in the number of eggs and larvae produced in the sludge-exposed population which reflected a failure of some females to spawn. Of the larvae produced, 60-70% from sludge-exposed parents were lighter and had a larger yolk-sac volume compared to larvae from non-exposed parents which may have indicated impaired yolk utilisation.

J	Plummer, J; Schreider, S				Plummer, Jonathan; Schreider, Sergei			Predicting inter-season price jumps in the market for temporary water allocations	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The market for temporary water allocations in the Northern Victoria Regulated river system has matured to the point where new instruments to manage risk can be of benefit to water users. One of these instruments could be a series of option contracts issued by the Water Authority. However a serious impediment to the introduction of options is the variation in prices across seasons. Prices jump between the end of one season and the beginning of the next mean that appropriate option strike prices cannot be determined until a period of trading in the new season allows price discovery to take place. This prevents an options market being available at the beginning of the season when it is most useful to irrigators. In this paper we look at winter rainfall for the town of Jamieson, upstream of Lake Eildon and the volume of water in Lake Eildon as predictors of the price of temporary water allocations at the beginning of the irrigation season. We develop a climate driven regression model which allows us to link the inter-seasonal jumps with the biophysical parameters of the system. By better understanding the factors dictating the size of the price jumps between seasons options can be developed that are not restricted to the current season. We also consider the implications of the infrastructure upgrades currently underway and recent policy changes on the market for temporary water allocations. The carryover policy which allows water to be kept for use in subsequent seasons, and the reserve policy, which is designed to allow the delivery of initial allocations and water carried over at the start of the irrigation season each year, are two recent policy innovations. These policies should smooth prices and reduce the jump in prices that have been seen between irrigation seasons. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Stout, BE; Cooke, F				Stout, BE; Cooke, F			Timing and location of wing molt in horned, red-necked and Western Grebes in North America	WATERBIRDS												We document timing and location of wing molt in the Horned Grebe (Podiceps auritus), Red-necked Grebe (Podiceps grisegena), and Western Grebe (Aechmophorus occidentalis). Horned Grebes left breeding ponds in late May to August and were observed on large ponds and lakes (near breeding locations) where they replaced remiges before progressing to wintering areas in September and October. Red-necked Grebes moved to much larger bodies of water such as the Great Lakes and the coast following breeding and prior to molt. On the Pacific Coast, Boundary Bay, British Columbia was identified as a major molt site. Freshwater molting areas were identified around Manitoulin Island in northern Lake Huron. On the Atlantic coast, molt sites were located in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Western Grebes were found in wing molt at both large freshwater lakes and coastal locations (including Boundary Bay, British Columbia). Like the Great Crested Grebe (P. cristatus) and Eared Grebe (P. nigicollis), Horned, Red-necked and Western Grebes move to special molt locations following breeding.																			1524-4695					MAR	2003	26	1					88	93		10.1675/1524-4695(2003)026[0088:TALOWM]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/1524-4695(2003)026[0088:TALOWM]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000181736900011

Coldwater fish oxythermal habitat in Minnesota lakes: influence of total phosphorus, July air temperature, and relative depth	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												An empirical model was developed that describes the influence of lake productivity, climate, and morphometry on coldwater fish oxythermal habitat. An oxythermal habitat variable called temperature at 3 mg.L-1 of dissolved oxygen (T-DO3) was developed by interpolating the water temperature at a benchmark oxygen concentration (3 mg.L-1) from a temperature-oxygen profile. Coldwater habitat was most available in the least productive lakes (total P < 25 mu g.L-1) with the greatest relative depths (geometry ratios < 2 m(-0.5)) and where mean July air temperatures were less than 17 degrees C. Species response curves were developed from values of T-DO3 measured during the greatest period of oxythermal stress in late summer (maxT(DO3)). Lake trout was present in lakes with the lowest values of maxT(DO3), while cisco was present in lakes with the highest and broadest range of maxT(DO3). Projections for a scenario where climate warming (+4 degrees C in mean July air temperature) was accompanied by eutrophication (doubling of total P) indicated that coldwater fish oxythermal habitat would be devastated in a subset of lakes typical for Minnesota. Protecting deep, unproductive lakes from eutrophication will be a necessary management strategy to ensure that coldwater fish persist in at least some Minnesota lakes after climate warming.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				DEC	2010	67	12					2002	2013		10.1139/F10-115	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F10-115													WOS:000285555200010

NUTRIENT RECYCLING BY EARED GREBES IN THE GREAT SALT LAKE	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling in lakes can be impacted by numerous abiotic and biotic factors. Large animals, such as birds and mammals, may recycle nutrients within a system or bring them in from surrounding habitats or different landscapes. Eared Grebes (Podiceps nigricollis) congregate in large numbers in the fall on the Great Salt Lake (GSL), Utah, and may have an important role in recycling nutrients from macroinvertebrates back into the water column. We evaluated the role of Eared Grebes in N and P cycling within the GSL by estimating the magnitude of their nutrient recycling capacity. We estimated Eared Grebe population size on the GSL over 5 years at 300,000 to over 4,300,000 birds. We used a previously published food intake model to estimate monthly recycling of N (5 to 300 tonnes) and P (0.4 to 25 tonnes). The maximum estimates of N and P loading by Eared Grebes are about 25% of nutrient recycling in the GSL caused by turnover in the water column. Eared Grebes may speed up nutrient recycling, making nutrients available to primary producers sooner. The contribution of waterbirds to nutrient cycling is important for the entire N and P cycles within the GSL.																			1527-0904	1944-8341				NOV	2016	76	3					281	286		10.3398/064.076.0304	http://dx.doi.org/10.3398/064.076.0304													WOS:000390593700003
J	Vähätalo, AV; Zepp, RG				Vähätalo, AV; Zepp, RG			Photochemical mineralization of dissolved organic nitrogen to ammonium in the Baltic Sea	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Solar-radiation-induced photochemistry can be considered as a new source of nutrients when photochemical reactions release bioavailable nitrogen from biologically nonreactive dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). Pretreatments of Baltic Sea waters in the dark indicated that > 72% of DON was recalcitrant to biological mineralization. When this DON (16-21.5 mu M) was exposed to simulated solar radiation, the concentration of NH4+ increased 0.5-2.5 mu M more in irradiated waters than in the dark controls. The photochemical production of NH4+ and the dose of absorbed photons were used to calculate the apparent quantum yield spectrum for photoammonification [mol NH4+ (mol photons)(-1) nm(-1)] at wavelengths (lambda) of 290-700 nm (phi NH4,lambda). The modeled mean rates of photoammonification based on phi NH4,lambda were 143 and 53 mu mol NH4+ m(-2) d(-1) at the surface and in the whole water column, respectively, of Baltic Sea stations during summer. The results of this study indicate that the rate of photoammonification approximately equals and periodically exceeds the rate of atmospheric deposition of reactive inorganic nitrogen to the northern Baltic Sea. Forthese stratified surface waters beyond riverine input of labile nitrogen, photoammonification can periodically be the largest source of new bioavailable nitrogen.

J	Birks, HJB				Birks, H. John B.			Contributions of Quaternary botany to modern ecology and biogeography	PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY												Quaternary (last 2.6 million years) botany involves studying plant megafossils (e.g. tree stumps), macrofossils (e.g. seeds, leaves), and microfossils (e.g. pollen, spores) preserved in peat bogs and lake sediments. Although megafossils and macrofossils have been studied since the late eighteenth century, Quaternary botany today is largely dominated by pollen analysis. Quaternary pollen analysis is just over 100 years old. It started primarily as a geological tool for correlation, relative dating, and climate reconstruction. In 1950 a major advance occurred with the publication by Knut Faegri and Johs Iversen of their Text-book of Modern Pollen Analysis which provided the foundations for pollen analysis as a botanical and ecological tool for studying past dynamics of biota and biotic systems. The development of radiocarbon dating in the 1950s freed pollen analysis from being a tool for relative dating. As a result of these developments, pollen analysis became a valuable implement in long-term ecology and biogeography. Selected contributions that Quaternary botany has made to ecology and biogeography since 1950 are reviewed. They fall into four general parts: (1) ecological aspects of interglacial and glacial stages such as location and nature of glacial-stage tree refugia and long-term soil development in glaciated and unglaciated areas; (2) biotic responses to Quaternary environmental change (spreading, extinction, persistence, adaptation); (3) ecological topics such as potential niches, the nature of vegetation, and tree and forest dynamics; and (4) its application to ecological topics such as human impact in tropical systems, conservation in a changing world, island palaeoecology, plant-animal interactions, and biodiversity patterns in time. The future of Quaternary botany is briefly discussed and 10 suggestions are presented to help strengthen it and its links with ecology and biogeography. Quaternary botany has much to contribute to ecology and biogeography when used in conjunction with new approaches such as ancient-DNA, molecular biomarkers, and multi-proxy palaeoecology.

J	Brittain, JE; Gjerseth, JE				Brittain, John E.; Gjerseth, Jan Egil			Long-term trends and variation in 137Cs activity concentrations in brown trout (Salmo trutta) from Ovre Heimdalsvatn, a Norwegian subalpine lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The Norwegian mountain lake, vre Heimdalsvatn, received major fallout from the Chernobyl accident in the spring of 1986. Activity concentrations of Cs-137 have been monitored annually in the brown trout (Salmo trutta) population of the lake over a 22-year period since 1986. The activity concentrations of Cs-137 in brown trout have declined over the period, although in recent years there has been little or no reduction in activity concentrations. Throughout the period, there has been considerable individual variation in Cs-137 activity concentrations. Within a single year, fish weight was the most significant factor affecting activity concentrations of Cs-137 in individual fish, although sex and age center dot weight were significant explanatory variables. The "size effect" was not significant during the initial period after fallout and in some recent years. During the first years after fallout, the ecological half-life of Cs-137 in brown trout was 3-4 years, but during the last decade this has increased significantly and has approached the physical half-life of 30 years for Cs-137, suggesting a dynamic equilibrium between catchments inputs, possible remobilisation from lake sediments and lake outputs of Cs-137.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2010	642	1					107	113		10.1007/s10750-010-0155-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0155-5													WOS:000275782400011

Challenges in instrumentation, spectroscopy, radiative transfer modeling, and retrievals are discussed. Current and planned satellite instruments with the capability to make tropospheric measurements in the ultraviolet and visible, with their measurement properties, spectral coverage, and target molecules, are presented. Measurement examples are taken from recent work done at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, together with our colleagues at a number of institutions. The examples include global tropospheric ozone (O-3) measurements from the nadir geometry; global tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2); bromine oxide (BrO) in the polar spring, and from salt lakes and volcanoes; global tropospheric formaldehyde (HCHO); and preliminary measurements of glyoxal (CHOCHO). Except for a few remaining developments, the field is shown to be sufficiently mature that global measurements of atmospheric pollution from space may be undertaken.																			1871-4668		1-4020-5088-7				2006							1	25		10.1007/978-1-4020-5090-9_1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-5090-9_1													WOS:000243470300001

Muskrat distributions in a changing Arctic delta are explained by patch composition and configuration	ARCTIC SCIENCE												Climate change is altering Canada's western Arctic, including hydrology in the heterogeneous environment of the Mackenzie Delta, and these changes are impacting biotic communities. Muskrats are culturally important semi-aquatic rodents whose populations may respond to changing water levels in this region. We investigated the importance of patch configuration and patch composition - two properties affected by climate change - on muskrat presence and distribution in the Mackenzie Delta, using remote sensing and field-based surveys of lakes with and without muskrats. We tested multiple hypotheses about predictors of muskrat and forage biomass presence using a model-selection approach. We found that configuration and patch composition explained o muskrat distribution in the Mackenzie Delta, with composition being of greater importance. Muskrats were more likely to occur in lakes with longer perimeters, higher amounts of forage biomass, and sediment characteristics that supported macrophyte growth. The latter two conditions are related to spring flooding regimes, which will likely be altered by climate change. This may result in a decrease in muskrat habitat in the Mackenzie Delta. Our research indicates that both patch composition and configuration are important for understanding species distributions in heterogeneous environments.					; Fisher, Jason/AFK-7984-2022	Fisher, Jason Thomas/0000-0002-9020-6509; Lantz, Trevor/0000-0001-5643-1537														2368-7460				JUN	2020	6	2					77	94		10.1139/as-2018-0017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/as-2018-0017													WOS:000536729800002

Fish, mostly alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus), comprised the major year-round food items in the wild; alewives were also fed to the caged juveniles. Fish residues averaged around 3 mg/kg of p,p''-DDE, 2mg/kg p,p'' DDT + p,p''-TDE [1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (p-chlorophenyl) ethane] and 2 mg/kg apparent PCBs [poly chlorinated biphenyls]. Juvenile body-burdens of DDE and PCBs showed a continual buildup after fledging, then a temporary dynamic equilibrium, related only in part to annual lipid deposition. Maximum body-burdens were reached in both juveniles and adults when winter fat deposits were declining prior to the breeding season.sbd.followed by a return to dynamic equilibrium. Residues of DDT and TDE followed closely the annual pattern of lipid deposition in both juveniles and adults. Total body-burdens in both age classes were similar after the buildups to equilibrium in juveniles in their 8 mo. after fledging. Seasonal variations of residues of DDE and PCBs were characterized by 2 phases in adults and 3 in juveniles, which gradually assumed the adult cyclic pattern. The maximum body-burdens attained by caged juveniles fed a diet of Lake Michigan alewives were 290 mg/kg DDE, 19 mg/kg DDT + TDE and 200 mg/kg apparent PCBs. Residues in wild adults at the same time were 300, 4 and 200 mg/kg of the same residues. Apparent PCBs and DDE were highly accumulative, although DDE levels resulted from dietary DDE as well as conversion from DDT.																			0269-7491	1873-6424					1976	10	3					183	200		10.1016/0013-9327(76)90036-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0013-9327(76)90036-7													WOS:A1976BW88400003

However, the appropriate amount of straw to substitute for fertilizer remains unclear. A field experiment was performed from 2016 to 2018 to explore the effect of different amounts of straw to substitute for fertilizer on soil properties, soil organic carbon (SOC) storage, grain yield, yield components, nitrogen (N) use efficiency, phosphorus (P) use efficiency, N surplus, and P surplus after rice harvesting. Relative to mineral fertilization alone, straw substitution at 5 t ha-1 improved the number of spikelets per panicle, effective panicle, seed setting rate, 1 000-grain weight, and grain yield, and also increased the aboveground N and P uptake in rice. Straw substitution exceeding 2.5 t ha-1 increased the soil available N, P, and K concentrations as compared with mineral fertilization, and different amounts of straw substitution improved SOC storage compared with mineral fertilization. Furthermore, straw substitution at 5 t ha-1 decreased the N surplus and P surplus by up to 68.3 and 28.9%, respectively, compared to mineral fertilization. Rice aboveground N and P uptake and soil properties together contributed 19.3% to the variation in rice grain yield and yield components. Straw substitution at 5 t ha-1, an optimal fertilization regime, improved soil properties, SOC storage, grain yield, yield components, N use efficiency (NUE), and P use efficiency (PUE) while simultaneously decreasing the risk of environmental contamination.

J	Pribyl, P; Shuman, BN				Pribyl, Paul; Shuman, Bryan N.			A computational approach to Quaternary lake-level reconstruction applied in the central Rocky Mountains, Wyoming, USA	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Sediment-based reconstructions of late-Quaternary lake levels provide direct evidence of hydrologic responses to climate change, but many studies only provide approximate lake-elevation curves. Here, we demonstrate a new method for producing quantitative time series of lake elevation based on the fades and elevations of multiple cores collected from a lake's margin. The approach determines the facies represented in each core using diagnostic data, such as sand content, and then compares the results across cores to determine the elevation of the littoral zone over time. By applying the approach computationally, decisions are made systematically and iteratively using different facies classification schemes to evaluate the associated uncertainty. After evaluating our assumptions using ground-penetrating radar (GPR), we quantify past lake-elevation changes, precipitation minus evapotranspiration (Delta(P-ET)), and uncertainty in both at Lake of the Woods and Little Windy Hill Pond, Wyoming. The well-correlated (r = 0.802 +/- 0.002) reconstructions indicate that water levels at both lakes fell at > 11,300,8000-5500, and 4700-1600 cal yr BP when Delta(P-ET) decreased to -50 to -250 mm/yr. Differences between the reconstructions are typically small (10 +/- 4 mm/yr since 7000 cal yr BP), and the similarity indicates that our reconstruction method can produce statistically comparable paleohydrologic datasets across networks of sites.

Numerical assessment of nutrient assimilative capacity of Khur-e-Musa in the Persian Gulf	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Khur-e-Musa is a predominantly tide-driven marine creek located in the northwestern part of the Persian Gulf. The port city of Mahshahr and several important industrial enterprises are located in the vicinity of this marine creek. Therefore, marine pollution due to discharge from regional industries into this water body has been a matter of interest for environmental studies. In this paper, nutrient assimilative capacity of the Khur-e-Musa during the summer time was studied. In order to perform any engineering project or marine environment study related to Khur-e-Musa, the prediction of currents is an essential task. Therefore, MIKE 3-FM hydrodynamic and quality model was used to simulate nutrients and chlorophyll a concentrations. OECD open boundary index was used to determine the trophic status probabilities. Different scenarios were defined and simulated to find the minimum nutrient load that causes eutrophication in all parts of Khur-e-Musa simultaneously. The results showed assimilative capacity of 7,180 kg/day TN and 1,305 kg/day TP for Khur-e-Musa.

J	Dove, A				Dove, Alice			Long-term trends in major ions and nutrients in Lake Ontario	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The Great Lakes Surveillance Program has been monitoring water quality for almost 40 years in Lake Ontario. The program provides some of the most comprehensive, systematic and detailed information that is available in the world for such a large lake. The water quality in Lake Ontario has shown dramatic changes over the last 40 years, with the early measurements indicating high phosphorus concentrations that were subsequently reduced by management responses to the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. Other water quality parameters, such as some of the major ions, showed reductions during the 1970s and 1980s as well. Nitrate plus nitrite nitrogen has increased in the lake throughout the period of record, likely driven by increasing watershed and atmospheric sources. A major driver of more recent trends in water quality appears to be the invasion and subsequent expansion of invasive Dreissena mussel populations that first appeared in Lake Ontario in 1989. Total phosphorus concentrations have further declined, and the proportion of total phosphorus that is soluble is increasing, possibly due to the filtering action of these mussels. Concentrations of major ions that are incorporated in mussel shells such as calcium have declined, while those that do not, such as magnesium, have increased.

J	GU, BH; ALEXANDER, V				GU, BH; ALEXANDER, V			DISSOLVED NITROGEN UPTAKE BY A CYANOBACTERIAL BLOOM (ANABAENA-FLOS-AQUAE) IN A SUB-ARCTIC LAKE	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Uptake of dissolved nitrogen (NH4+ + NO3- + urea + N2) by a cyanobacterial [Anabaena flos-aquae (Lyngb.)] De Breb population in Smith Lake, Alaska, was measured every 2 to 4 days during the spring of 1990. Total dissolved nitrogen uptake ranged from 0.34 to 24.75 mumol liter-1 h-1, with a mean of 5.75 mumol liter-1 h-1; the euphotic zone accounted for 91% of the uptake. The mean turnover time for dissolved combined nitrogen (NH4+ + NO3- + Urea) in the euphotic zone was less than 14 h, and that for NH4+ was only 3.6 h. The mean relative preference indices for NH4+ (2.4), NO3- (0.4), and urea (0.5) established NH4+ as the preferred nitrogenous nutrient. The uptake rates were apparently dependent on biomass, temperature, and light. Regeneration, probably due to zooplankton excretion and bacterial remineralization of dissolved organic nitrogen, was the main source of NH4+ for the cyanobacterial growth. The high half-saturation constant for NH4+ with low ambient NH4+ concentration nevertheless resulted in the simultaneous utilization of several forms of nitrogen.																			0099-2240					FEB	1993	59	2					422	430		10.1128/AEM.59.2.422-430.1993	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.59.2.422-430.1993								16348867					WOS:A1993KK91600011

The results of the study for the continuous two years showed that in Chao Lake basin the loss of total nitrogen annual was 7.38-69.59kg/hm(2), nitrate nitrogen was 13.74-60.16kg/hm(2), ammonium nitrogen was 1.40-4.84kg/hm(2), the wastage rate of total nitrogen yearly was 1.68-7.69 %. The study was carried out to reduce the gross of nitrogen and phosphorus on the basis of the high yield fertilizer, compared with the common fertilizer and high yield fertilizer, all the reduction could effectively decrease the runoff loss of nitrogen. Nitrate nitrogen was the main form of the nitrogen, supplemented by ammonium nitrogen. The highest nitrogen loss of all treatments is the common fertilizer. Reduction with straw returning could help to lower the risk of the nitrogen runoff loss in wheat season, but it wasn't very obviously in the rice season. Total nitrogen concentration of the runoff water which generated by rainfall exceeded 2mg/L, the standard of the surface runoff. Considering the yield and environmental effect, the recommend fertilizer ratio of nitrogen in wheat season in Chao Lake basin of Anhui province (base fertilizer-winter fertilizer-jointing fertilizer) is 6-2.5-1.5,, the ratio in rice season (base fertilizer-tillers fertilizer-ear fertilizer) is 4-4-2.

Freshwater ice as habitat: partitioning of phytoplankton and bacteria between ice and water in central European reservoirs	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY REPORTS												Abundant phytoplankton and bacteria were identified by high-throughput 16S rRNA tag Illumina sequencing of samples from water and ice phases collected during winter at commercial fish ponds and a sand pit lake within the UNESCO Tr. ebon. Basin Biosphere Reserve, Czech Republic. Bacterial reads were dominated by Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Despite dominance by members of just two phyla, UniFrac principal coordinates analysis of the bacterial community separated the water community of Klec fish pond, as well as the ice-associated community of Klec-Sand Pit from other samples. Both phytoplankton and cyanobacteria were represented with hundreds of sequence reads per sample, a finding corroborated by microscopy. In particular, ice from Klec-Sand Pit contained high contributions from photoautotrophs accounting for 25% of total reads with reads dominated by single operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of the cyanobacterium Planktothrix sp. and two filamentous diatoms. Dominant OTUs recovered from ice were largely absent (<0.01%) from underlying water suggestive of low floristic similarity of phytoplankton partitioned between these phases. Photosynthetic characterization of phototrophs resident in water and ice analysed by variable chlorophyll a fluorescence showed that communities from both phases were photosynthetically active, thus supporting ice as viable habitat for phytoplankton in freshwater lakes and reservoirs.					; Bullerjahn, George/F-4428-2010; McKay, Robert/P-3759-2017; Prasil, Ondrej/H-2454-2014	Bullerjahn, George/0000-0001-5319-7896; McKay, Robert/0000-0003-2723-5371; Prasil, Ondrej/0000-0002-0012-4359													1758-2229					DEC	2015	7	6					887	898		10.1111/1758-2229.12322	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.12322								26224255					WOS:000368136100010

Biological effects, as well as variations in carbon source inputs, and in the exchange rate with atmospheric CO2, are commonly considered the main controls on the carbon isotope values of authigenic lacustrine carbonate. We present sedimentological and geochemical evidence that favors physical processes - evaporation effects and CO2-degassing - as major controls on C-13 enrichment. We propose that large enrichments may result from the non-equilibrium gas-transfer isotope fractionation during CO2-degassing from thermal springs and evaporation effects in arid environments. The dilution effect by large quantities of C-14-free CO2 hinders accurate C-14 chronology of these lake records based on lacustrine organic matter and aquatic plants. Our results indicate that geothermal and volcanic CO2 sources in lake basins located in volcanic settings, and physical fractionation may have a greater significance than commonly accepted to explain lacustrine carbon isotope records.

J	Dwyer, TR; Mullins, HT; Good, SC				Dwyer, TR; Mullins, HT; Good, SC			Paleoclimatic implications of Holocene lake-level fluctuations, Owasco lake, New York	GEOLOGY												Radiocarbon-controlled stratigraphic data from Owasco Lake valley, New York, document two cycles of relative lake-level change during the Holocene in response to regional variations in effective precipitation. Lake highstands occurred at 10.5 and 6.9 ka, with an intervening lowstand at 9 ka. The 10.5 ka highstand occurred during the well-known Killarney-Younger Dryas cold interval (11.2-10.0 ka) in response to decreased evaporation and increased precipitation, The driest interval of the early-middle Holocene occurred similar to 9 ka, at the time of maximum summer solar insolation. A second highstand occurred during the Hypsithermal (similar to 8.5-5.5 ka) in response to increased precipitation at a time when the interior of North America underwent maximum aridity, This out-of-phase relationship between northeastern North America and the midcontinent during the Hypsithermal may have been a consequence of a northward shift of the jet stream and a change of precipitation patterns in response to increased global warmth. If the Hypsithermal can be used as an analog for potential global warming, the northeastern United States may experience future increases in regional precipitation.																			0091-7613					JUN	1996	24	6					519	522		10.1130/0091-7613(1996)024<0519:PIOHLL>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0091-7613(1996)024<0519:PIOHLL>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1996UQ19700010

Combining spatial modelling and radar to identify and protect avian migratory hot-spots	CURRENT ZOOLOGY												Migrating landbirds are known to follow coast lines and concentrate on peninsulas prior to crossing water bodies, especially during daylight but also at night, creating enhanced potential collision hazards with man-made objects. Knowing where these avian migration "hot-spots" occur in time and space is vital to improve flight safety and inform the spatial planning process (e. g. environmental assessments for offshore windfarms). We developed a simple spatial model to identify avian migration hot-spots in coastal areas based on prevailing migration orientation and coastline features known, from visual and radar observations, to concentrate migrating landbirds around land masses. Regional scale model validation was achieved by combining nocturnal passerine movement data gathered from two tier radar coverage (long-range dual-polarization Doppler weather radar and short-range marine surveillance radar) and standardised bird ringing. Applied on a national scale, the model correctly identified the ten most important Danish coastal hot-spots for spring migrants and predicted the relative numbers of birds that concentrated at each site. These bird numbers corresponded well with historical observational data. Here, we provide a potential framework for the establishment of the first three-dimensional avian airspace sanctuaries, which could contribute to more effective conservation of long-distance migratory birds					; Desholm, Mark/J-5980-2013	Bovith, Thomas/0000-0003-0887-8320; 													1674-5507					OCT	2014	60	5					680	691		10.1093/czoolo/60.5.680	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/czoolo/60.5.680													WOS:000342355500014

Although the bacterioplankton plays an important ecological role in fisheries ecosystems, the effect of artificial fishery habitat on bacterioplankton is not clear. In this study, high-throughput sequencing based on the 16S rRNA gene was carried out to study the characteristics of bacterioplankton community structure in artificial fishery habitat and to determine the principal environmental factors that shaped the composition, structure and function of bacterioplankton communities in an unfed aquaculture system. Results The results indicated that the most dominant phyla were Proteobacteria (Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria), Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, which accounted for 28.61%, 28.37%, 19.79%, and 10.25% of the total abundance, respectively. The factors that cause the differences in bacterioplankton community were mainly manifested in three aspects, including the diversity of the community, the role of artificial fishery habitat, and the change of environmental factors. The alpha diversity analysis showed that the diversity and richness index of the bacterioplankton communities were the highest in summer, which indicated that the seasonal variation characteristics had a great influence on it. The CCA analysis identified that the dissolved oxygen, temperature, and ammonium salt were the dominant environmental factors in an unfed aquaculture system. The LEfSe analysis founded 37 indicator species in artificial structure areas (AS group), only 9 kinds existing in the control areas of the open-water group (CW group). Meanwhile, the KEGG function prediction analysis showed that the genes which were related to metabolism in group AS were significantly enhanced. Conclusions This study can provide reference value for the effect of artificial habitat on bacterioplankton community and provide fundamental information for the follow-up study of ecological benefits of artificial fishery habitat. It may be contributed to apply artificial fishery habitat in more rivers.					; WANG, Gongpei/ISA-8425-2023; Li, Fangfang/D-9908-2013; su, yuqin/HSF-8943-2023	Chen, Xiaoli/0000-0001-7327-4860; 														2730-7182				FEB 3	2022	22	1							10	10.1186/s12862-022-01965-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12862-022-01965-3								35114951					WOS:000750827500001

The distribution of the invasive New Zealand mud snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) in streams in the Lake Ontario and Lake Erie watersheds	BIOINVASIONS RECORDS												The invasive New Zealand mudsnail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, is a small freshwater hydrobiid snail with populations in western US rivers and streams and in the Laurentian Great Lakes. The snail has had established populations in the Great Lakes since at least 1991 and in one stream emptying into Lake Ontario since at least 2007. This study's purpose was to broadly survey streams and rivers emptying into Lakes Ontario and Erie to determine the extent of the species' lotic invasion in the Eastern US. In the summer of 2011, over 100 sites were sampled from the Niagara River, NY to Oswego, NY along Lake Ontario and over 80 sites from Buffalo, NY to the Pennsylvania-Ohio State line along Lake Erie. At each site, general observations of the stream were made and the organisms living in the stream were surveyed for the presence of New Zealand mud snails. Potamopyrgus was found at the site of original discovery and at one additional location along Lake Ontario. In addition an unusual snail was discovered that was a hybrid between a native species (Pleurocera livescens) and an invasive (Pleurocera virginica). This hybrid was extremely abundant in several locations and may be invasive.

S.; Montz, Gary			Simultaneous invasion decouples zebra mussels and water clarity	COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY												Species invasions are a leading threat to ecosystems globally, but our understanding of interactions among multiple invasive species and their outcomes on ecosystem properties is undeveloped despite their significance to conservation and management. Here we studied a large lake in Minnesota, USA, that experienced a simultaneous surge in invasive zebra mussel and spiny water flea populations. A long-term (2000-2018) dataset offered a rare opportunity to assess whole-ecosystem shifts following the co-invasion. Within two years, the native crustacean zooplankton community declined abruptly in density and productivity (-93% and -91%, respectively). Summer phytoplankton abundance and water clarity remained stable across the time series, an unexpected outcome given the high density of zebra mussels in the lake. Observational data and modeling indicate that removal of native herbivorous zooplankton by the predatory spiny water flea reduced zooplankton grazing pressure enough to compensate new grazing losses due to zebra mussels, resulting in a zero net effect on phytoplankton abundance and water clarity despite a wholesale shift in secondary production from the pelagic to the benthic food web. This study reveals the extent of direct and indirect effects of two aquatic invaders on food-web processes that cancel shifts in water clarity, a highly valued ecosystem service.

Influence of hatch duration and individual daily growth rates on size structure of age-0 smallmouth bass cohorts in two glacial lakes	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												We assessed hatch dates and daily growth rates of age-0 smallmouth bass from two glacial lakes over a 3-year period. Hatching durations (19-27 days among years) of smallmouth bass occurred from late May until late June. Mean daily growth rate of age-0 smallmouth bass ranged from 0.56 to 1.56 mm.day(-1). Correlation analysis indicated that hatch date had little effect on daily growth rates. Hatch date was significant in explaining variation in total length (TL) of age-0 smallmouth bass at time of capture in only three of six cases and hatch date never explained > 50% of the variation in bass length. Daily growth rate significantly explained variation in smallmouth bass TL at time of capture in all six models, accounting for 31-86% of the variability in bass length. Our findings suggest that size structure of age-0 cohorts in some populations may be more strongly regulated by variation in individual daily growth rate than by hatch timing.

J	Soniya, J; Kakwani, D; Singh, N				Soniya, Jatin; Kakwani, Dhara; Singh, Neha			Assessment of factors affecting hydrologic variability of Wadhvana wetland, Gujarat (India)	SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												The Wadhvana wetland, a Ramsar site, is a wintering place for migratory birds, including endangered species. The current study aimed to evaluate the variables influencing the hydrologic variability of the Wadhvana wetland through an analysis of water distribution throughout the pre- and post-monsoon seasons. The Modified Normalised Difference Water Index (MNDWI) was computed using Landsat data to estimate the water spread. The wetland's catchment region was analyzed using SRTM Digital Elevation Model data to examine the drainage pattern and drainage basin. The results of the analysis indicate that the premonsoon water coverage area decreased significantly between 2003 and 2022. However, the postmonsoon water amount is sustained through imports from the Narmada Canal. The drastic change in the water spread may affect the wetland's aquatic flora as in the dry season the wetland would be prone to cattle grazing or agricultural activities by nearby residents. Predominant land use in the drainage basin is the usage of land for agriculture, where water requirement is fulfilled either with groundwater drawn from tubewells or water from the Wadhvana wetland. The random survey conducted in the villages near the wetland indicates that the residents depend on the wetland for irrigation and livestock farming. The wetland and the aquifer in the basin are hydraulically connected, thus for long-term sustenance of the wetland, conservation efforts and measures would be required to improve the irrigation techniques and maximize the rainwater harvesting for groundwater recharge so that the pressure on the wetland can be minimized.																			2363-5037	2363-5045				AUG	2024	10	4							149	10.1007/s40899-024-01128-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40899-024-01128-w													WOS:001266294000001

In addition, tephras represent records of explosive volcanic activity and permit assessment of regional ashfall hazard. In this paper we report a detailed Holocene tephrochronological model developed for the Kamchatsky Peninsula region of eastern Kamchatka (NW Pacific) based on similar to 2800 new electron microprobe analyses of single glass shards from tephra samples collected in the area as well as on previously published data. Tephra ages are modeled based on a compilation of 223 C-14 dates, including published dates for Shiveluch proximal tephra sequence and regional marker tephras; new AMS C-14 dates; and modeled calibrated ages from the Krutoberegovo key site. The main source volcanoes for tephra in the region are Shiveluch and Kliuchevskoi located 60-100 km to the west. In addition, local tephra sequences contain two tephras from the Plosky volcanic massif and three regional marker tephras from Ksudach and Avachinsky volcanoes located in the Eastern volcanic front of Kamchatka. This tephrochronological framework contributes to the combined history of environmental change, tectonic events, and volcanic impact in the study area and farther afield. This study is another step in the construction of the Kamchatka-wide Holocene tephrochronological framework under the same methodological umbrella. Our dataset provides a research reference for tephra and cryptotephra studies in the northwest Pacific, the Bering Sea, and North America. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Decadal trends and ecological shifts in backwater lakes of a large floodplain river: Upper Mississippi River	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Shallow lakes are typically found in one of two stable states, a macrophyte-dominated clear water state or a turbid state due to excessive phytoplankton and suspended sediment. Whether shallow backwater lakes in large river floodplains exhibit similar alternate stable states is less understood. This study considers mechanisms, interactions and feedbacks associated with a shift in environmental conditions and biotic community structure in backwater lakes of a hydrologically dynamic floodplain river system. We use long-term data from backwater lakes to show an increase in submersed aquatic vegetation, improved water quality, and resulting shifts in the community structure of aquatic vegetation and fish following a 4 year period of summer low water discharge on the Upper Mississippi River. Backwater lakes in our study span a gradient of environmental conditions. Backwater lakes located in the upper reach of our study area were chronically turbid and support only sparse aquatic macrophytes, whereas those downriver exhibited clearer water and abundant vegetation. An increase in submersed aquatic vegetation in the lower backwater lakes resulted in a fish community shift to more vegetation-associated species. A lesser response in submersed aquatic vegetation abundance and fish community shift was observed in the upper, more turbid backwater lakes. The combination of vegetative cover and turbidity were key environmental variables associated with fish community structure in lower backwater lakes. Turbidity was the key environmental variable associated with submersed aquatic vegetation in both upper and lower backwaters. Providing further insight into the physical, chemical and biological interactions associated with ecological shifts will help guide management and restoration decisions towards more resilient, macrophyte-rich floodplain backwaters.																			1015-1621	1420-9055				FEB 18	2020	82	2							27	10.1007/s00027-020-0703-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-020-0703-7													WOS:000518627900002

Gill-net catches of Bonneville whitefish and Bear Lake whitefish over four different habitat types during their respective spawning seasons were used to estimate the relative utilisation of each habitat type. Netting results indicated that both species select rock habitat as preferred spawning substrate. The gill-net catches over each substrate type were corroborated using underwater video to observe spawning fish. Spawning activity was only documented over rocky habitat even though all habitat types were investigated. The feeding ecology of both species was examined from 2002-2004. Bonneville whitefish were caught in highest numbers at depths < 35 m. At a size of < 250 mm total length, they were found to consume a variety of food types, with chironomids being the dominant item consumed (present in 59-100% of all stomachs that contained food). In contrast, Bear Lake whitefish were caught in the highest numbers at depths > 35 m and almost exclusively consumed ostracods (present in 71-85% of the stomachs that contained food). Although the greatest biomass of ostracods occurred at depth of < 25 m, Bear Lake whitefish were not caught in large numbers at these shallower depths (no Bear Lake whitefish were caught at depths of < 15m) nor were they likely feeding in the most productive depths of Bear Lake. Even though they fed heavily on ostracods at depths where ostracods were not as prevalent, this food source is likely not a limiting factor in their diet.																			1612-166X		978-3-510-47062-4				2007	60						247	+																WOS:000249090200020

EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE												Chad is the largest country of the Sahel region with different climatic zones, varying from arid in the north to tropical in the south. These climatic zones respond differently to climate change signals. Therefore, their detection over major cities, which are scattered within different climatic zones, is of utmost importance. The changes in hydroclimatic fields such as rainfall and temperature were examined over the major cities in various regions for the period 1950 to 2014. Rainfall shows a significant decreasing trend especially over cities close to Lake Chad (Lere, Mondou, Mongo, and Sarh), whereas no significant trend is observed for cities farther from the Lake. However, a consistently increasing trend in temperature is found across all cities. The cities in the north (Faya, Abeche, and Ati) receive far less rainfall than those located in southern Chad. All cities (except Faya and Lere) received higher rainfall during 1950-1965 (wet period), entering a dry regime between 1966 and 1990 (dry period) and subsequently recovering rainfall totals, toward previous levels, between 1991 and 2014 (recovery phase). A substantial rise in air temperature is observed after 1980-1985, reflecting the gradual rise of temperature in recent times. In summary, rainfall is recovering from a dry regime and temperature is rising over all the major cities of Chad. More researches in this region is needed to develop local scale mitigation strategies and adaptation technology.					; Pattnayak, Kanhu/AAM-9745-2020; Maharana, Pyarimohan/Q-4121-2018	PATTNAYAK, KANHU CHARAN/0000-0001-9589-8789; Abdel-lathif, Ahmat Younous/0000-0001-8997-6007; Maharana, Pyarimohan/0000-0003-3175-8714													2333-5084					JUL	2019	6	7					1149	1160		10.1029/2019EA000619	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019EA000619													WOS:000480595000009

The present study aimed to assess the diversity and distribution of aquatic insects in Sagar Lake, India, in relation to physicochemical parameters across different seasons. A total of 5,352 aquatic insects were collected from eight different sites, representing 29 taxa. Hemiptera emerged as the most abundant order, with Diplonychus rusticus being the dominant species across all seasons. The highest species richness was recorded during the rainy season, which can be attributed to increased habitat heterogeneity and improved colonization conditions. In contrast, the winter season exhibited the highest abundance of individuals. Statistical analyses revealed significant correlations between aquatic insect diversity and water quality parameters, such as depth, dissolved oxygen, chloride, and total alkalinity. The Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP), Stream Invertebrate Grade Number-Average Level (SIGNAL 2), and Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT) indices were employed to evaluate water quality. The BMWP scores indicated moderate to good water quality, with seasonal variations, while SIGNAL 2 scores consistently suggested severe pollution across all sites. ASPT values indicated moderate pollution, reinforcing the need for effective water quality management strategies. The absence of pollution-sensitive taxa such as Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Tricoptera further highlights the lake's pollution stress. This study underscores the importance of biomonitoring in freshwater ecosystems and calls for conservation measures to mitigate pollution and enhance aquatic biodiversity.

A benthic invertebrates-based biotic index to assess the ecological status of West African Sahel Rivers, Burkina Faso	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Conserving aquatic resources in the West African Sahel requires water management tools to assess the ecological status of surface water bodies threatened by mounting pressures from agricultural intensification and urbanization. Macroinvertebrate communities of Sahelian rivers were examined to test if a multi-metric index approach could be developed to assess the ecological quality of rivers. A total of 40 sample sites falling within a continuum ranging from "unimpaired reference sites " to "impaired sites " were assessed during this study. Macro invertebrates were sampled with a hand net following a multi-habitat sampling approach. Key environmental parameters, both physico-chemical and hydro-morphologic, were recorded. More than 20 candidate metrics were evaluated in four categories: composition, functional feeding, diversity, and tolerance. We used detailed analysis procedures to exclude unsuitable metrics from the data set. After excluding redundant metrics, six-core metrics were selected to compose the Sahel River Multimetric Index (SRMI): Total-taxa, Shannon & Weiner index, EPTtaxa, ASPT-NEPBIOS and ASPT-SASS and Collector-filterers. The final index derived from these metrics was divided into five ecological quality classes (high, good, moderate, poor, and bad). The results showed that the SRMI responded to a set of environmental parameters associated with a gradient of human pressures affecting the ecological integrity of water bodies (R-2 & GE;|0.50|; p < 0.05; p < 0.001). This work produced a data base and analysis that confirms the usefulness of an unprecedented and promising tool for biological monitoring and decision-making in Sahelian regions' water management.

A millennium of metallurgy recorded by lake sediments from Morococha, Peruvian Andes	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												To date, information concerning pre-Colonial metallurgy in South America has largely been limited to the archaeological record of artifacts. Here, we reconstruct a millennium of smelting activity in the Peruvian Andes using the lake-sediment stratigraphy of atmospherically derived metals (Pb, Zn, Cu, Ag, Sb, Bi, and Ti) and lead isotopic ratios (Pb-206/Pb-207) associated with smelting from the Morococha mining region in the central Peruvian Andes. The earliest evidence for metallurgy occurs ca. 1000 A.D., coinciding with the fall of the Wari Empire and decentralization of local populations. Smelting during this interval appears to have been aimed at copper and copper alloys, because of large increases in Zn and Cu relative to Pb. A subsequent switch to silver metallurgy under Inca control (ca. 1450 to conquest, 1533 A.D.) is indicated by increases in Pb, Sb, and Bi, a conclusion supported by further increases of these metals during Colonial mining, which targeted silver extraction. Rapid development of the central Andes during the 20th century raised metal burdens by an order of magnitude above previous levels. Our results represent the first evidence for pre-Colonial smelting in the central Peruvian Andes, and corroborate the sensitivity of lake sediments to pre-Colonial metallurgical activity suggested by earlier findings from Bolivia.

J	EFFLER, SW; PERKINS, M; JOHNSON, DL				EFFLER, SW; PERKINS, M; JOHNSON, DL			OPTICAL HETEROGENEITY IN LAKE CHAMPLAIN	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Optical properties of eleven stations on Lake Champlain are described for a single survey in the late summer of 1990. Light penetration, the angular distribution of irradiance, and the spectral quality of underwater irradiance were quantified by measurements with a Secchi disc, quantum sensors, and a spectroradiometer. Estimates of absorption (a) and scattering coefficients (b) are presented, and a is partitioned according to contributing components. Microscopy-based individual particle analyses provide insights concerning the role of particles in light attenuation. Major spatial differences in the concentration and composition of attenuating components, and thereby a and b, apparently promoted by the lake's physical setting and disparate localized material loading conditions, caused substantial spatial heterogeneity in measured optical characteristics. Phytoplankton were a minor attenuating component throughout the lake during the survey. More important components were water itself, gelbstoff, and particles of terrigenous origin. The role of non-phytoplankton material and the heterogeneity of its distribution have important implications with respect to responses in clarity, due to changes in phytoplankton concentration.																			0380-1330						1991	17	3					322	332		10.1016/S0380-1330(91)71369-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(91)71369-5													WOS:A1991GK77500005
J	Xue, JB; Zhong, W; Xie, LC; Unkel, I				Xue, Jibin; Zhong, Wei; Xie, Lichun; Unkel, Ingmar			Vegetation responses to the last glacial and early Holocene environmental changes in the northern Leizhou Peninsula, south China	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												A well-dated palynological record spanning the interval similar to 40,500-7060 cal yr BP, retrieved from a peatland on the Leizhou Peninsula in south China, clearly shows regional vegetation and climate changes during the last glacial period. Pollen data showed that the study region was mainly covered by subtropical evergreen trees during Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3), indicating a subtropical climate with relatively high temperature and precipitation. During MIS 2, subtropical evergreen-deciduous forest with large areas of grassland occurred, implying cooler and drier conditions. Some tropical forest elements increased during the early Holocene, indicating a warm and wet trend. Several millennial-scale oscillations of the pollen records appeared to correlate with the cold anomalies in the North Atlantic region. Our records agree well with many records from other regions, but they are a bit different than that inferred from the neighboring Huguang Maar Lake. Furthermore, our results suggest that the vegetation surrounding Xialu peatland was strongly influenced by the migration of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and variability in the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). Changes of atmospheric CO2 concentration (PCO2) levels may have also affected the long-term vegetation changes in the study region. (C) 2015 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

J	Kusin, FM; Azani, NNM; Hasan, SNMS; Sulong, NA				Kusin, Faradiella Mohd; Azani, Nur Najihah Mohd; Hasan, Sharifah Nur Munirah Syed; Sulong, Nur Aqilah			Distribution of heavy metals and metalloid in surface sediments of heavily-mined area for bauxite ore in Pengerang, Malaysia and associated risk assessment	CATENA												A detailed investigation has been conducted to evaluate the distribution of heavy metals and metalloid in the surface sediments of a bauxite mining area in association with the potential ecological and human health risk. Field sampling was carried out within the Pengerang bauxite mining areas, including mine tailings, ex-mining pond and streams. Distribution of heavy metals (Al, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, Sr, Zn) and metalloid such as As in sediments indicated that Fe and Al constituted the greatest portion of metal elements in the sediment while Pb and Cu were found exceeding the recommended guideline values at some locations. Assessment of potential ecological risk (PERI) demonstrated low to medium ecological risk in the metal-contaminated sediments with Cd, As and Pb have generally greater risk compared to other metals, contributing the most to the total risk index (RI). The sediment enrichment factor (EF) indicated no enrichment of most metals while Pb and As at some locations were classified as having minor and moderately to severe enrichment. The geo-accumulation index (Igeo) and contamination factor (CF) indicated that the sediments were classified uncontaminated with respect to most metals. Assessment of potential human health risk revealed that the hazard index (HI) values of the carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks were an order of magnitude higher among children compared to adults. There were no significant non-carcinogenic risk due to metals and metalloid in the study area as HIs < 1. However, the lifetime cancer risk (LCR) for As is relatively higher than other metals and falls within tolerable LCR for regulatory purposes. Therefore, this study has highlighted the implication on potential ecological and human health risks of heavy metal occurrence in sediments of bauxite mining areas thus indicating the importance of geomorphological changes due to land exploitation for mining sector.

J	Meixler, MS; Arend, KK; Bain, MB				Meixler, MS; Arend, KK; Bain, MB			Fish community support in wetlands within protected embayments of Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Fish community data were collected to investigate the role of wetlands in supporting fish communities of protected embayments in Lake Ontario. Wetland and deeper, more open, littoral sites were sampled in five protected embayments using gill nets, fyke nets, minnow traps, and electrofishing gear during the summers of 2001 and 2002. Pooled gear data were used to analyze community composition, size frequency, and species richness. We found that even within protected embayments where community composition of both habitats is similar, wetlands support a community of fish different in species dominance and size structure than littoral embayment habitats. The abundance of young-of-year fish suggests that wetlands support fish populations by providing important nursery habitat. The similarity in fish community composition between wetland and littoral habitats indicates that wetlands remain important in supporting a subset of the embayment fish community. These results demonstrate that both wetlands and littoral areas in embayments are valuable and intensively utilized fish habitats that should receive special consideration in ecosystem management plans for the Great Lakes.

The measured radon concentrations varied from 0.265 (in lake water) to 107 Bq L-1 (in underground water) with the following trend from the lowest to the highest: Rn-222 in lakes<Rn-222 in rivers<Rn-222 in stream<Rn-222 in dug wells<Rn-222 in thermal waters<Rn-222 in drilled wells. Overall, the average Rn-222 concentration in groundwater is twelve times higher than that in the surface water.Assuming that each person drinks 2.10(-3) m(3) d(-1) and uses six cubic meters for washing purposes per month, the estimated total annual effective dose due to ingestion and inhalation of radon from the studied water samples ranges from 1.3 to 541 mu Sv y(-1) for adults; from 1.2 to 479 mu Sv y(-1) for children; and from 2.1 to 838 mu Sv y(-1) for infants.
